Dave Gallaher

David Gallaher (30October 1873 – 4October 1917) was an Irish-born New Zealand <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a> footballer best remembered as the captain of the "<a href="The%20Original%20All%20Blacks">Original All Blacks</a>"—the 1905–06 <a href="New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">New Zealand national team</a>, the first representative New Zealand side to tour the British Isles. Under Gallaher's leadership the Originals won 34 out of 35 matches over the course of tour, including legs in France and North America; the New Zealanders scored 976 points and conceded only 59. Before returning home he co-wrote the classic rugby text "The Complete Rugby Footballer" with his vice-captain <a href="Billy%20Stead">Billy Stead</a>. Gallaher retired as a player after the 1905–06 tour and took up coaching and <a href="Glossary%20of%20rugby%20union%20terms%23Selector">selecting</a>; he was a selector for both <a href="Auckland%20rugby%20union%20team">Auckland</a> and New Zealand for most of the following decade.

Born in <a href="Ramelton">Ramelton</a>, Ireland, Gallaher migrated to New Zealand with his family as a small child. After moving to <a href="Auckland">Auckland</a>, in 1895 he joined <a href="Ponsonby%20RFC">Ponsonby RFC</a> and was selected for his province in 1896. In 1901–02 he served with the <a href="List%20of%20New%20Zealand%20units%20in%20the%20Second%20Boer%20War">New Zealand Contingent</a> in the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Anglo-Boer War</a>. He first appeared on the New Zealand national team for their unbeaten tour of Australia in 1903, and played in New Zealand's first ever <a href="Test%20match%20%28rugby%20union%29">Test match</a>, against <a href="Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Australia</a> in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>. The Originals Gallaher captained during 1905–06 helped to cement rugby as New Zealand's national sport, but he was relentlessly pilloried by the British press for his role as <a href="Thomas%20Ellison%23Wing-forward">wing-forward</a>. The use of a wing-forward, which critics felt was a tactic to deliberately obstruct opponents, contributed to decades of strain between the rugby authorities of New Zealand and the <a href="Home%20Nations">Home Nations</a>; the <a href="World%20Rugby">International Rugby Football Board</a> (IRFB) effectively outlawed the position in 1931.

During the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>, Gallaher enlisted in the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Division">New Zealand Division</a> to fight in Europe. He was killed in 1917 at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Passchendaele">Battle of Passchendaele</a> in Belgium. He has since been inducted into the <a href="World%20Rugby%20Hall%20of%20Fame">World Rugby Hall of Fame</a>, <a href="International%20Rugby%20Hall%20of%20Fame">International Rugby Hall of Fame</a>, and the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame">New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame</a>. A number of memorials exist in Gallaher's honour, including the <a href="Gallaher%20Shield">Gallaher Shield</a> for the winner of Auckland's club championship, and the <a href="Dave%20Gallaher%20Trophy">Dave Gallaher Trophy</a> contested between the national teams of <a href="France%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">France</a> and New Zealand.

Dave Gallaher was born as David Gallagher on 30October 1873 at <a href="Ramelton">Ramelton</a>, <a href="County%20Donegal">County Donegal</a>, Ireland, the third son of James Henry Gallagher, a 69-year-old shopkeeper, and his 29-year-old wife, Maria Hardy Gallagher ("née" McCloskie). James was a <a href="widower">widower</a> who had married Maria in 1866, a year after the death of his first wife. James had two children from his first marriage, and David was the seventh from his marriage to Maria. The couple had three more children after David, but of their ten offspring, three died in infancy. The couple's other offspring were: Joseph (born 1867), Isabella (1868), James (1869), Maria (called Molly, 1870), Jane (1871), Thomas (1872), William (1875), Oswald (1876), and James Patrick (1878). David was baptised as a <a href="Presbyterianism">Presbyterian</a> in the First Ramelton Meeting House on 8January 1874.

After the struggling in his drapery business in Ramelton, James decided to emigrate with his family to New Zealand as part of <a href="George%20Vesey%20Stewart">George Vesey Stewart</a>'s <a href="Katikati">Katikati</a> Special Settlement scheme. In May 1878 the Gallaghersminus the sick James Patrick who at eight weeks old was too weak to make the tripsailed from Belfast on the "Lady Jocelyn" for Katikati in the <a href="Bay%20of%20Plenty">Bay of Plenty</a>. On arriving in New Zealand, the family altered their surname to "Gallaher" in an effort to reduce confusion over its spelling and pronunciation.
The Gallaher couple and their six children arrived in <a href="Auckland">Auckland</a> after a three-month voyage, and from there sailed to <a href="Tauranga">Tauranga</a> in the Bay of Plenty, before their final voyage to Katikati. On arrival they found the settlement scheme was not what they had envisaged or been promised: the land allocated to the family required enormous work to be broken in before being suitable for farming, there was no easy access to water, and the settlement was very hilly. It had been hoped that James would be employed as the agent for the Donegal Knitting Company in New Zealand, which was to be established by <a href="Lord%20George%20Augusta%20Hill">Lord George Augusta Hill</a>. But Hill died unexpectedly and his successor did not support the initiative. As the family's poor quality land was insufficient to make a living, the children's mother Maria soon became the chief breadwinner after she obtained a position teaching for £2 a week at the new No. 2 School.

In January 1886 David spent a week in Auckland hospital undergoing surgery to treat stunted muscles in his left leg which had led to curvature of his spine. His mother became sick that same year, and in 1887 lost her teaching position. His mother's condition worsened and she died of cancer on 9September 1887. With a father in his seventies, the 13-year-old David was compelled to leave school so he could help his brothers to support the family. He took a job with a local stock and station agent.

The older Gallaher children had to work to prevent the local authorities from putting their younger siblings up for adoption. In 1889, with the exception of William who remained in Katikati, the family joined Joseph in Auckland, where he had found work. Davidwho was by now 17 years oldwas able to obtain work at the Northern Roller Mills Company, and was soon a member of the firm's junior <a href="cricket">cricket</a> team. In the late 1890s Gallaher took employment at the Auckland Farmers' <a href="Slaughterhouse">Freezing Company</a> as a labourer; by the time of his deployment for the First World War two decades later he had risen to the position of foreman. His work required the constant handling of heavy animal carcasses, which helped him build upper body strength and kept him fit.

Gallaher first gained attention for his talents as a rugby player while living in Katikati. After moving to Auckland, he played junior rugby for the <a href="Parnell%20RFC">Parnell</a> club from 1890. He joined the <a href="Ponsonby%20RFC">Ponsonby District Rugby Football Club</a> in 1895, after the family moved to <a href="Freemans%20Bay">Freemans Bay</a> following Joseph's marriage to Nell Burchell. Gallaher, who played at <a href="Rugby%20union/hooker">hooker</a>, was selected for an Auckland "B" side that year, and made his debut for the <a href="Auckland%20rugby%20union%20team">Auckland provincial side</a> against the touring <a href="Queensland%20Reds">Queensland</a> team on 8August 1896. The Aucklanders won 15–6. Gallaher was retained for Auckland's remaining fixtures that season: defeats to <a href="Wellington%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Wellington</a>, <a href="Taranaki%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Taranaki</a> and <a href="Otago%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Otago</a>.

In 1897, Gallaher's Ponsonby club won eight of their nine matches en route to the Auckland club championship. He was selected to play for Auckland against the <a href="New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">New Zealand representative side</a> that had just completed a tour of Australia. The Aucklanders won 11–10 after scoring a late <a href="try">try</a>; it was only New Zealand's second loss of their eleven-match tour. Later that year Gallaher was selected for Auckland's three-match tour where they defeated Taranaki, Wellington and <a href="Wanganui%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Wanganui</a>. Wellington's defeat was their first loss at home since the formation of the Wellington Rugby Football Union in 1879. The following season was less eventful for Gallaherhe played much of the season for Ponsonby, but injury prevented his selection for Auckland.

After missing the 1898 season for Auckland, Gallaher continued to be selected for the province throughout 1899 and 1900. The side was undefeated over this time; he played for them twice in 1899, and in all four matches in 1900. He represented Auckland province a total of 26 times over his career.

In January 1901 Gallaher joined the Sixth <a href="List%20of%20New%20Zealand%20units%20in%20the%20Second%20Boer%20War">New Zealand Contingent</a> of <a href="Mounted%20infantry">Mounted Rifles</a> for service in the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Anglo-Boer War</a>. When enlisting he gave his date of birth as 31October 1876, three years later than the actual date. It is unknown why he did this but the later date continued to be used in official records for the rest of his life. Gallaher was given a send-off dinner by his Ponsonby club before the contingent departed from Auckland on 31January. After disembarking in South Africa at <a href="East%20London%2C%20Eastern%20Cape">East London</a> on 14March 1901, Gallaher's contingent immediately embarked for <a href="Pretoria">Pretoria</a>, and it was there that, as part of forces under the command of General <a href="Herbert%20Plumer%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Plumer">Herbert Plumer</a>, they set about their task of "rid[ding] the Northern <a href="South%20African%20Republic">Transvaal</a> of <a href="Boer">Boer</a> guerrillas and sympathizers."

A member of the contingent's 16th (Auckland) Company, he served in the advanced guard, who scouted ahead of the main force. In October 1901 Gallaher contracted malaria, and was hospitalised in <a href="Charlestown%2C%20KwaZulu-Natal">Charlestown</a>, <a href="Colony%20of%20Natal">Natal</a>. In a letter he composed to his sister while recovering he wrote:

Between late December 1901 and early January 1902 Gallaher and his contingent were involved in a number of skirmishes. He described one incident where he had several Boer fighters in his sights, but did not have "the heart" to fire at them while they rescued one of their comrades. Describing a later encounter to his sister, Gallaher wrote: "We had a total of 22 killed and 36 injured and a few taken prisoners[;] it was a pretty mournful sight to see the Red Cross bearers cruising around the field fetching all the dead and wounded who were laying all over the place". By March 1902 Gallaher had reached the rank of squadron sergeant-major, and his contingent was on its way to <a href="Durban">Durban</a>. There the unit boarded ship for New Zealand, but Gallaher stayed behind, transferring to the Tenth New Zealand Contingent. His new unit did not see active service in South Africa, and he returned with them to New Zealand in August 1902. For his service Gallaher received the <a href="Queen%27s%20South%20Africa%20Medal">Queen's South Africa Medal</a> (Cape Colony, Orange Free State, and Transvaal Clasps), and <a href="King%27s%20South%20Africa%20Medal">King's South Africa Medal</a> (South Africa 1901 and South Africa 1902 Clasps).

During his time in South Africa Gallaher did play some rugby, including captaining the New Zealand military team that played ten games and won the rugby championship among the British forces. But he was not fit enough to play immediately upon his return to New Zealand, and so did not resume playing rugby for Ponsonby until the 1903 season. When he did return for his club, for the first match of the year, he was described as "the outstanding forward" in a comprehensive defeat of Parnell.

Despite having missed two seasons of provincial rugby, Gallaher was included in the 22-man New Zealand representative squad to <a href="1903%20New%20Zealand%20rugby%20union%20tour%20of%20Australia">tour Australia</a> during 1903. He was the first Ponsonby player ever to play for the New Zealand team, commonly known as the "All Blacks". The 1903 team to Australia was, according to <a href="Winston%20McCarthy">Winston McCarthy</a>'s 1968 history of the All Blacks, "still regarded by old-timers as the greatest team to ever leave New Zealand." The tour did not start wella preliminary match in New Zealand, against Wellington, was lost 14–5, though Gallaher did score his first try for his country.

Gallaher played eight matchesthe first four as hooker and the remainder as wing-forwardout of eleven during the six-week tour. The party was captained by the veteran Otago player <a href="Jimmy%20Duncan%20%28rugby%20union%29">Jimmy Duncan</a>, who was widely recognised as a master tactician. The first match in Australia, against <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Waratahs">New South Wales</a>, was won 12–0 by the New Zealanders, despite their having a man sent off. After playing a Combined Western Districts side, New Zealand played a second match against New South Wales. New Zealand won again, but only 3–0 on a flooded pitch at <a href="Sydney%20Cricket%20Ground">Sydney Cricket Ground</a>. The side continued touring the state before making their way north to Queensland, where they twice played the state side. The New Zealanders then returned to New South Wales, where the first-ever <a href="Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Australia</a>–New Zealand rugby union <a href="Test%20match%20%28rugby%20union%29">Test match</a> took place in Sydney.

Since the selection of the first New Zealand team in 1884, inter-colonial games had been played against New South Wales (ten New Zealand wins from thirteen matches), and Queensland (seven New Zealand wins from seven), but none had been contested against a combined Australian side. The matchwon 22–3 by the New Zealanders, who scored three tries to nilmarked Gallaher's first international <a href="Cap%20%28sport%29">cap</a>. The last match of the tour was against New South Wales Country; New Zealand won 32–0. On their ten-match tour of Australia, New Zealand had scored 276 points and conceded only 13.

Back in New Zealand, Gallaher was selected for the North Island in his first ever <a href="North%20vs%20South%20rugby%20union%20match">Inter-Island</a> match; the South won 12–5. He then continued playing for Auckland, who were conducting a tour of both islands. Gallaher appeared in six of their seven matches, against Taranaki, Wellington, <a href="Southland%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Southland</a>, Otago, <a href="Canterbury%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Canterbury</a>, and <a href="South%20Canterbury%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">South Canterbury</a>. Auckland lost the first two matches, but won the others.

In 1904 the first <a href="Ranfurly%20Shield">Ranfurly Shield</a> match was played. The shield, a provincial challenge trophy won by defeating the holder, was to become the most prestigious trophy in domestic New Zealand rugby. Due to their unmatched provincial record at the time Auckland were awarded the shield. The first shield challenge was played against Wellington, who were not expected to pose much of a threat. Auckland had not lost at home in six years, but, with Gallaher in the side, were upset 6–3 by the Wellingtonians. Gallaher was then selected for the New Zealand team that faced the touring <a href="British%20and%20Irish%20Lions">British Isles</a> in what was New Zealand's first Test match on home soil. The British team were conducting a <a href="1904%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20Australia%20and%20New%20Zealand">tour of Australia and New Zealand</a>, and had finished their Australian leg unbeaten.

Jimmy Duncan, who was coaching New Zealand after retiring as a player, said before the historic match: "I have given them directions. It's man for man all the time, and I have bet Gallaher a new hat that he can't catch [Percy] <a href="Percey">Bush</a>. Bush has never been collared in Australia but he'll get it today." The match was <a href="Tie%20%28draw%29">tied</a> 3–3 at half-time, but New Zealand were the stronger side in the second half and eventually won 9–3. Gallaher was praised by press for his all-round display at wing-forward, but in particular for his successful harassment of the British Isles' <a href="Rugby%20union/scrumhalf">half-back</a> <a href="Tommy%20Vile">Tommy Vile</a>.

The New Zealand defeat was the first tour loss for the British side, who then drew with a combined Taranaki-Wanganui-Manawatu side before travelling to Auckland. Gallaher played for Auckland against the tourists and scored one of the tries in their 13–0 victory. He was part of a forward pack that dominated their opponents, and again he troubled Vile; his tackling of Vile and Bush killed many British attacks. The rugby historian <a href="Terry%20McLean">Terry McLean</a> would write in 1987 that "his display could be ranked with the finest exhibitions of wing-forward play". Gallaher represented Auckland once more in 1904, a 3–0 loss to Taranaki.

At the end of the 1904 season the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Rugby%20Union">New Zealand Rugby Football Union</a> (NZRFU) suspended Gallaher from playing after a disagreement over a claim for expenses he had submitted to the <a href="Auckland%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Auckland Rugby Football Union</a> for travel to play in the match against the British Isles. Eventually the matter was resolved when, under protest, Gallaher repaid the disputed amount. This settlement, coupled with his performance in 26–0 North Island win over the South Island in the pre-tour trial, allowed Gallaher to be considered for selection for New Zealand's <a href="The%20Original%20All%20Blacks">1905–06 tour</a> of Europe and North America. The NZRFU had been trying to secure an invitation to send a team to Britain for some time, and were finally able to secure satisfactory financial guarantees to proceed in 1905. This was the first representative New Zealand team to undertake such a tour, though a privately organised team, the <a href="1888%E2%80%9389%20New%20Zealand%20Native%20football%20team">New Zealand Natives</a>, had preceded them in 1888–89.

The NZRFU named Gallaher captain for the tour, with <a href="Billy%20Stead">Billy Stead</a> as vice-captain. A week into the voyage to Britain aboard the "<a href="SS%20Rimutaka%20%281900%29">SS Rumutaka</a>", rumours circulated that some of the southern players were unhappy with the appointment of Gallaher, and with what they perceived as an Auckland bias in the squad. The dissidents contended that the captain and vice-captain should have been elected by the players, as they had been on the 1897 and 1903 tours to Australia. Gallaher recognised the damage factionalism might do to the team and offered to resign, as did the vice-captain Stead. Although the teams' manager refused to accept the resignations, the players still took a vote—17 out of 29 endorsed the NZRFU's selections.

During the voyage to England the team conducted training drills on the ship's deck; for this the forwards were coached by Gallaher and fellow player <a href="Bill%20Cunningham%20%28rugby%20union%29">Bill Cunningham</a>, while Stead was in charge of the backs. Consequently, the services of the NZRFU-appointed coach Jimmy Duncan were not used; his appointment had caused opposition from many in the squad who believed his expertise was not required, and that an extra player should have been taken on tour instead. After a six-week voyage, the team arrived in <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a>, England on 8September 1905.

The New Zealanders' first match was against the <a href="Devon%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Devon county side</a> at <a href="Exeter">Exeter</a>. A close contest was expected, but New Zealand ran out 55–4 winners, scoring twelve tries and conceding only a <a href="Drop%20goal">drop-goal</a>. Reaction to the match was mixedthe team were accompanied by a cheering crowd and marching band following the win, but Gallaher's play at wing-forward provoked some criticism in the press.

The use of a wing-forward was a distinctive feature of New Zealand play. Instead of having eight men in the <a href="scrum%20%28rugby%20union%29">scrum</a> as was normal elsewhere, seven men were usedthe missing man, the wing-forward, instead fed the ball into the scrum then held onto one of their hookers while the ball progressed through the scrum to their half-back. With the wing-forward bound to the side of the scrum, the opposing half-back would then have to manoeuvre past him to tackle the player with the ball. This increased the amount of time the half-back would have in possession of the ball before his opposite could tackle him.

The use of this new tactic by New Zealand meant that Gallaher, the team's wing-forward, was repeatedly accused by the English of obstruction, though the referee Percy Coles, an official of the English <a href="Rugby%20Football%20Union">Rugby Football Union</a> (RFU), rarely penalised him in the Devon match. The Originals' <a href="Rugby%20union%20positions%23Full-back">fullback</a> <a href="Billy%20Wallace">Billy Wallace</a> posited that New Zealand's superior scrum made Gallaher's style of play more prominent. Unlike British and Irish teams of the time, New Zealand employed specialist positions for their forwards. Despite often facing an extra man in the scrum, the New Zealanders "drove like a cleaver through British forward packs". Gallaher later said: "I think my play is fairI sincerely trust soand surely the fact that both Mr Percy Coles and Mr D. H. Bowentwo of the referees of our matches, and fairly representative of English and Welsh ideas, have taken no exception so it ought to have some weight." The British press, looking to find fault in New Zealand's play, continued to criticise Gallaher throughout the tour. Gallaher believed the key to his side's success was a difference in playing styles, while Winston McCarthy believed the unique backline formation to be a major factor.

Following the opening match the "All Blacks"as the New Zealand team came to be knowndefeated <a href="Rugby%20union%20in%20Cornwall">Cornwall</a> and then <a href="Bristol%20Bears">Bristol</a>, both 41–0. They then defeated <a href="Northampton%20Saints">Northampton</a> 32–0. The tour continued in much the same way, with the All Blacks defeating <a href="Leicester%20Tigers">Leicester</a>, <a href="Middlesex%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Middlesex</a>, <a href="Durham%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Durham</a>, Hartlepool Clubs and <a href="Northumberland%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Northumberland</a>; in nearly all cases the defeats were inflicted without conceding any points (the one exception being Durham, who scored a try against New Zealand). The New Zealanders then comfortably defeated <a href="Gloucester%20Rugby">Gloucester</a> and <a href="Somerset%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Somerset</a> before facing <a href="Plymouth%20Albion%20R.F.C.">Devonport Albion</a>, the incumbent English club champions, who had not lost at home in 18 months. New Zealand beat them 21–3 in front of a crowd of 20,000. Gallaher scored the All Blacks' final try, an effort described by the "Plymouth Herald" as, "... a gem. It was a tearing rush for about fifty yards with clockwork-like passing all the way."

New Zealand won their next seven matches, including victories over <a href="Blackheath%20F.C.">Blackheath</a>, <a href="Oxford%20University%20RFC">Oxford University</a> and <a href="Cambridge%20University%20R.U.F.C.">Cambridge University</a>. Billy Wallace contended that the New Zealanders' form peaked with the win over Blackheath; he recalled that "after this game injuries began to take their toll and prevented us ever putting in so fine a team again on the tour." By the time the All Blacks played their first Test match, against <a href="Scotland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Scotland</a>, the team had played and won nineteen matches, and scored 612 points while conceding only 15.

The <a href="Scottish%20Rugby%20Union">Scottish Football Union</a> (SFU), the governing body for rugby union in Scotland, did not give the New Zealanders an official welcome, and sent only one official to greet them on their arrival in Edinburgh. In addition, the SFU refused a financial guarantee for the match, promising the gate receipts to the New Zealanders instead; this meant that the NZRFU had to take on all monetary responsibilities for the match. One reason for the cold reception from the SFU may have been because of negative reports from <a href="David%20Bedell-Sivright">David Bedell-Sivright</a>, who was Scotland's captain and had also captained the British Isles team on their 1904 tour of New Zealand. Bedell-Sivright had reported unfavourably on his experiences in New Zealand the previous year, especially regarding the wing-forward play of Gallaher.

When time for the Scotland Test did arrive, it was discovered that as the ground had not been covered for protection from the elements, and had frozen over. The SFU wanted to abandon the match, but Gallaher and the tour manager <a href="George%20Dixon%20%28rugby%20administrator%29">George Dixon</a> contended that the weather would improve enough for the pitch to thaw, and the match was eventually allowed to proceed. The Test was closely contested, with Scotland leading 7–6 at half-time, but the All Blacks scored two late tries to win 12–7; despite the close score-line, the New Zealanders were clearly the better of the two sides.

Four days later the tourists played a West of Scotland selection, where they received a much warmer reception than for the Scotland match, then travelled via Belfast to Dublin where they faced <a href="Ireland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Ireland</a>. Gallaher did not play in either match due to a leg injury suffered during the Scotland Test. New Zealand won the Ireland match 15–0, then defeated a team representing <a href="Munster%20Rugby">Munster</a> province.

By the time of New Zealand's next game, against England in London, Gallaher had recovered from his injury enough to play. Between 40,000 and 80,000 saw the match. The All Blacks scored five tries (four by <a href="Duncan%20McGregor">Duncan McGregor</a>, playing at <a href="Rugby%20union/wing">wing</a>) to win 15–0. According to the England player <a href="Dai%20Gent">Dai Gent</a>, the victory would have been even greater had the match conditions been dry. "One cannot help thinking that England might have picked a stronger side," said Gallaher. "From our experience, we did not think that this side was fully representative of the best men to be found in the country." Observers noted that Gallaher still seemed to be suffering from his leg injury during the match. New Zealand played three more matches in Englandwins over Cheltenham, <a href="Cheshire%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Cheshire</a>, and <a href="Yorkshire%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Yorkshire</a>before travelling on to Wales.

<a href="Wales%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Wales</a> were the dominant rugby country of the four <a href="Home%20Nations">Home Nations</a>, and in the middle of a "golden age" at the time.
Gallaher and his team faced them three days after the Yorkshire match. The All Blacks had thus far played 27 matches on tour, scoring 801 points while conceding only 22, and all in only 88 days. They were struggling to field fifteen fit players; a number of their best players, including Stead, were unavailable due to injury.

The match was preceded by an All Black <a href="Haka%20%28sports%29">haka</a>, to which the crowd responded with the Welsh national song "<a href="Hen%20Wlad%20Fy%20Nhadau">Land of my Fathers</a>". Wales had developed tactics to negate the seven-man New Zealand scrum, and removed a man from their scrum to play as a "rover", equivalent to Gallaher's wing-forward position. Gallaher was consistently penalised by the Scottish referee, <a href="John%20Dallas">John Dallas</a>, who held that the New Zealander was feeding the ball into the scrum incorrectly. This eventually compelled Gallaher to instruct his team not to contest the scrums, and therefore give Wales possession following each scrum. <a href="Bob%20Deans">Bob Deans</a>, playing at wing for New Zealand that day, later said that Dallas had gone "out to penalise Gallaherthere is no doubt about that". <a href="Teddy%20Morgan">Teddy Morgan</a> scored an unconverted try for Wales shortly before half-time to give the home side a 3–0 lead.

The New Zealand backs had been poor in the first half, and the side's general form was well below that of earlier in the tour. However New Zealand were generally perceived to be the better side in the second half, with the performance of the Welsh fullback <a href="Bert%20Winfield">Bert Winfield</a> keeping his team in the game. The most controversial moment of the tour happened late in the second half. Wallace recovered a Welsh kick and cut across the field, and with only Winfield to beat, passed to the New Zealand wing Deans. What happened next has provoked intense debate: Deans was tackled by the Welsh and either fell short of the <a href="Rugby%20union%23Playing%20field">try-line</a>, or placed the ball over it before being dragged back. Dallas, who had dressed in heavy clothing and was struggling to keep up with the pace of the game, was behind play. When he arrived he ruled that Deans was short of the try-line, and so did not award New Zealand a try. Play continued, but the All Blacks could not score, and Wales won 3–0. This was New Zealand's first loss of the tour.

Following the match Gallaher was asked if he was unhappy with any aspect of the game; he replied that "the better team won and I am content." When asked about Dallas's refereeing, he said: "I have always made it a point never to express a view regarding the referee in any match in which I have played". Gallaher was gracious in defeat, but Dixon was highly critical of both Dallas and the Welsh newspapers, who he accused of "violently and unjustly" attacking New Zealand's captain. Gallaher would later admit that he had been annoyed by this criticism, which he found unfair; he also pointed out that though the Welsh condemned the wing-forward position, they had themselves adopted some elements of it. Later during the tour, when discussing the issue of his feeding the ball into the scrum, he said: 

Four more matches were contested in Wales, with Gallaher appearing in three. He played in the match against <a href="Glamorgan%20County%20RFC">Glamorgan</a>, won by New Zealand 9–0, but had his finger bitten, which was serious enough for him to miss the fixture against Newport. He returned to face <a href="Cardiff%20RFC">Cardiff</a>, the Welsh champions, on Boxing Day. Gallaher was again booed by the Welsh crowd, and once more the All Blacks were troubled in the scrum, this time after losing a player to injury. The New Zealanders won, but narrowly; Gallaher asserted after the match that Cardiff were the strongest club side they had met during the tour. New Zealand then faced <a href="Swansea%20RFC">Swansea</a> in their last match in the British Isles. Gallaher again struggled to field a fit side, and at 3–0 down late in the match they were heading for their second defeat on tour. Wallace kicked a drop-goalthen worth four pointslate in the game to give the All Blacks a narrow 4–3 victory.

The side departed Wales and travelled to Paris, where they faced <a href="France%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">France</a> on 1January 1906, in the home side's first ever Test match. The All Blacks led 18–3 at half time. After the French scored their second try, giving them 8 pointsthe most any team had scored against the All Blacksthe New Zealanders responded with six unanswered tries to win 38–8. They then returned to London, where they learned that New Zealand's <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20New%20Zealand">Prime Minister</a>, <a href="Richard%20Seddon">Richard Seddon</a>, had arranged for them to return home via North America. Not all of the players were keen on the idea, and four did not make the trip, but the new plans did give the team over two weeks to spend in England before their departure.

Before the New Zealand squad left Britain for North America, the English publisher Henry Leach asked Stead and Gallaher to author a book on rugby tactics and play. They finished the task in under a fortnight and were each paid £50. Entitled "The Complete Rugby Footballer", the book was 322 pages long and included chapters on tactics and play, as well as a summary of rugby's history in New Zealand including the 1905 tour. It was mainly authored by Stead, a bootmaker, with Gallaher contributing most of the diagrams. Gallaher almost certainly made some contributions to the text, including sections on Auckland club rugby, and on forward play. The book showed the All Blacks' tactics and planning to be superior to others of the time, and according to <a href="Matt%20Elliott%20%28writer%29">Matt Elliott</a> is "marvellously astute"; it received universal acclaim on its publication. According to a 2011 assessment by <a href="ESPN%20Inc.">ESPN</a>'s Graham Jenkins, it "remains one of the most influential books produced in the realms of rugby literature".

The New Zealanders travelled to <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, where they played an exhibition game, then on to <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>. There they played two official matches against <a href="British%20Columbia%20Rugby%20Union">British Columbia</a>, and won both easily. The tour programme thus ended; New Zealand had played 35 games and lost only once. Gallaher had played in 26 of those matches, including four Tests. Over their 32 matches in the British Isles New Zealand scored 830 points and conceded 39; overall they scored 976 points and conceded only 59. On their arrival back in New Zealand on 6March 1906, the All Blacks were welcomed by a crowd of 10,000 before being hosted at a civic reception in Auckland. Invited to speak at the reception, Gallaher said: "We did not go behind our back to talk about the Welshman, but candidly said that on that day the better team had won. I have one recommendation to make to the New Zealand [Rugby] Union, if it was to undertake such a tour again, and that is to play the Welsh matches first."

The 1905–06 Originals are remembered as perhaps the greatest of All Black sides, and set the standard for all their successors. They introduced a number of innovations to Britain and Ireland, including specialised forward positions and unfamiliar variations in attacking plays. But while their success helped establish rugby as New Zealand's national sport and fed a growing sporting nationalism, the controversial wing-forward position contributed to strained ties with the Home Nations' rugby authorities. British and Irish administrators were also wary of New Zealand's commitment to the amateur ethos, and questioned their sportsmanship. According to the historian Geoffrey Vincent, many in the traditional rugby establishment believed that: "Excessive striving for victory introduced an unhealthy spirit of competition, transforming a character-building 'mock fight' into 'serious fighting'. Training and specialization degraded sport to the level of work."

The success of the Originals provoked plans for a professional team of players to tour England and play <a href="Rugby%20Football%20League">Northern Union</a> clubs in what is now known as <a href="rugby%20league">rugby league</a>. Unlike rugby league, which was professional, rugby union was strictly amateur at the time, and in 1907 a professional team from New Zealand known as the "<a href="1907%E2%80%9308%20New%20Zealand%20rugby%20tour%20of%20Australia%20and%20Great%20Britain">All Golds</a>" (originally a play on "All Blacks") toured England and Wales before introducing rugby league to both New Zealand and Australia. According to historian Greg Ryan, the All Golds tour "confirmed many British suspicions about the rugby culture that had shaped the 1905 team."

These factors may have contributed to the gap between All Black tours of the British Islesthey next toured in 1924. The NZRFU was denied representation on the <a href="World%20Rugby">International Rugby Football Board</a> (IRFB)composed exclusively of English, Irish, Scottish and Welsh membersuntil 1948. After complaining about the wing-forward for years, the Home Nations-administered IRFB made a series of law changes that effectively outlawed the position in 1931.

Gallaher retired from playing after the All Blacks' tour, but remained involved in the sport as a coach and <a href="Glossary%20of%20rugby%20union%20terms%23Selector">selector</a>. He coached at age group level for Ponsonby and in 1906 succeeded <a href="Frederick%20Murray%20%28rugby%20union%29">Fred Murray</a> as sole selector of the Auckland provincial team. He was Auckland selector until 1916; over this time Auckland played 65 games, won 48, lost 11 and drew 6. Gallaher did make a brief comeback as a playertravelling as the selector of an injury depleted Auckland team, he turned out against <a href="Marlborough%20Rugby%20Union">Marlborough</a> at <a href="Blenheim%2C%20New%20Zealand">Blenheim</a> in 1909; Marlborough won 8–3. He also played against the Maniapoto sub-union just over a week later. Auckland held the Ranfurly Shield from 1905 to 1913, successfully defending it 23 times. The team struggled to retain the shield during 1912 and 1913 and eventually lost it to Taranaki in a 14–11 defeat. During Gallaher's tenure as selector Auckland inflicted an 11–0 defeat of the touring <a href="1908%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20New%20Zealand%20and%20Australia">1908 Anglo-Welsh</a> side, defeated the <a href="M%C4%81ori%20All%20Blacks">New Zealand Māori</a> in 1910, and beat Australia 15–11 in 1913.

Gallaher was also a national selector from 1907 to 1914, and with <a href="George%20Nicholson%20%28rugby%20player%29">George Nicholson</a> co-coached the All Blacks against the 1908 Anglo-Welsh team. A number of Gallaher's team-mates from the 1905–06 tour were included in the New Zealand squad for the series; of three Tests, the All Blacks won two and drew the other. During Gallaher's incumbency as a national selector, New Zealand played 50 matches, won 44, lost four and drew two. This included 16 Tests, of which only one was lost and two drawn.

Although exempt from <a href="conscription">conscription</a> due to his age, Gallaher enlisted in May 1916. While awaiting for his call-up to begin training he learnt that his younger brother Company Sergeant-Major Douglas Wallace Gallaher had been killed while serving with the <a href="11th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">11th Australian Battalion</a> at <a href="Laventie">Laventie</a> near <a href="Fromelles">Fromelles</a> on 3June 1916. Douglas had been living in <a href="Perth">Perth</a>, Australia prior to the war and had previously been wounded at <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli</a>. Biographer Matt Elliott describes it as a "myth" that Gallaher enlisted to avenge his younger brother; rather he claims that it was most likely due to "loyalty and duty".

After enlisting and completing his basic training at <a href="Trentham%20Military%20Camp">Trentham</a> he was posted to 22nd Reinforcements, 2nd Battalion, Auckland Regiment within the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Division">New Zealand Division</a>. Gallaher left New Zealand aboard the "<a href="SS%20Aparima%20%281902%29">Aparima</a>" in February 1917 and reached Britain on 2May. Gallaher was a member of the ship's Sports Committee and spent time organising and practising for a planned rugby match at the <a href="Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a>it is unknown if the match ever took place. After arriving in England he was promoted to the rank of temporary sergeant and dispatched to <a href="Sling%20Camp">Sling Camp</a> for further training. His rank was confirmed as sergeant on 6June 1917.

Gallaher's unit fought in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Messines%20%281917%29">Battle of Messines</a>, near La Basse Ville, and in August and September 1917 they trained for the upcoming <a href="Battle%20of%20Passchendaele">Passchendaele</a> offensive. In the attack on <a href="Battle%20of%20Broodseinde">Gravenstafel Spur</a> on 4October 1917 Gallaher was wounded by a piece of shrapnel that penetrated through his helmet, and he died later that day at the <a href="3rd%20Australian%20Casualty%20Clearing%20Station">3rd Australian Casualty Clearing Station</a>, Gravenstafel Spur. He was 43 years old.

Dave Gallaher is buried in grave No. 32513 at Nine Elms British Cemetery, which is west of <a href="Poperinge">Poperinge</a> on the Helleketelweg, a road leading from the R33 Poperinge ring road in Belgium. His regulation gravestone, bearing the silver fern of New Zealand, incorrectly gives his age as 41. New Zealand sides touring Europe have since regularly visited his grave site. For his war service Gallaher was posthumously awarded the <a href="British%20War%20Medal">British War Medal</a> and the <a href="Victory%20Medal%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Victory Medal</a>. His brother Henry, who was a miner, served with the <a href="51st%20Battalion%2C%20Far%20North%20Queensland%20Regiment">Australian 51st Battalion</a> and was killed on 24April 1917. Henry's twin brother, Charles, also served in the war and survived being badly wounded at Gallipoli.

On 10October 1906 Gallaher married "Nellie" Ellen Ivy May Francis at All Saints Anglican Church, <a href="Ponsonby%2C%20New%20Zealand">Ponsonby</a>, Auckland. Eleven years younger than Gallaher, Nellie was the daughter of Nora Francis and the sister of <a href="Arthur%20Francis%20%28rugby%29">Arthur ('Bolla') Francis</a>a fellow rugby player. For many years prior to the marriage Gallaher had boarded at the Francis family home where he had come to know Nellie. Both had also attended the All Saints Anglican Church where Nellie sang in the choir. With his limited income, and frequent absences from work playing rugby, Gallaher found boarding his best accommodation option. On 28September 1908 their daughter Nora Tahatu (later Nora Simpson) was born. Nellie Gallaher died in January 1969.

Gallaher's brother-in-law Bolla Francis played for Ponsonby, Auckland and New Zealand sides for a number of years, including when Gallaher was a selector. In 1911, at age 29, and in the twilight of his All Blacks' career, he decided to switch to the professional sport of rugby league. Francis went on to represent New Zealand in rugby league, making him a <a href="List%20of%20dual-code%20rugby%20internationals">dual-code international</a>. It is unlikely his switch to rugby league was done without Gallaher's knowledge. Francis did eventually return to rugby union as a coach.

Gallaher was also a member of the fraternal organisation the <a href="Ancient%20Order%20of%20Druids">United Ancient Order of the Druids</a>, and attended meetings fortnightly in <a href="Newton%2C%20New%20Zealand">Newton</a>, not far from Ponsonby. He also played several sports in addition to rugby, including cricket, yachting and athletics.

In 1922 the Auckland Rugby Football Union introduced the <a href="Gallaher%20Shield">Gallaher Shield</a> in his honour; it has since been awarded to the winner of the union's premier men's club competition. PonsonbyGallaher's old clubhave won the title more than any other club. At international level New Zealand and France contest the <a href="Dave%20Gallaher%20Trophy">Dave Gallaher Trophy</a>, which was first awarded when New Zealand defeated France on Armistice Day in 2000. In 2011 New Zealand's then oldest living All Black, Sir <a href="Fred%20Allen%20%28rugby%20union%29">Fred Allen</a>, unveiled a high bronze statue of Gallaher beside one of the entrances at <a href="Eden%20Park">Eden Park</a> in Auckland. The statue was created by <a href="Malcolm%20Evans%20%28cartoonist%29">Malcolm Evans</a>. Gallaher has been inducted into the <a href="International%20Rugby%20Hall%20of%20Fame">International Rugby Hall of Fame</a>, the <a href="World%20Rugby%20Hall%20of%20Fame">World Rugby Hall of Fame</a>, and the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame">New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame</a>.

In 2005 members of the All Blacks witnessed the unveiling of a plaque at Gallaher's birthplace in Ramelton, which was presented in conjunction with the renaming of <a href="Letterkenny%20RFC">Letterkenny RFC</a>'s home ground to "<a href="Dave%20Gallaher%20Memorial%20Park">Dave Gallaher Memorial Park</a>". Gallaher's name is also incorporated into the club's crest. The ground was upgraded following its renaming, and in 2012 the Letterkenny section of the ground was opened by former All Black, and Ponsonby stalwart, <a href="Bryan%20Williams%20%28rugby%20union%29">Bryan Williams</a>. An Ireland-produced documentary about Gallaher's life, "The Donegal All Black", was aired in 2015. Later that year, a jersey worn by Gallaher during the 1905 British Isles tour was sold at auction in Cardiff for £180,000—nearly 10 times the previous record auction price for a rugby jersey.

"Gallaher played many dashing games," the British newspaper "<a href="The%20Sportsman%20%281865%20newspaper%29">The Sportsman</a>" reported after his death, "and led his side from one success to another until they were deemed invincible. He was a veritable artist, who never deserved all the hard things said about him, especially in South Wales. A great player, a great judge of the game". Gallaher's military experience gave him an appreciation for "discipline, cohesion and steadiness under pressure." He was however quiet, even dour, and preferred to lead by example. He insisted players spend an hour "contemplating the game ahead" on match days, and also that they pay attention to detail. Original All Black <a href="Ernie%20Booth">Ernie Booth</a> wrote of Gallaher: "To us All Blacks his words would often be, 'Give nothing away; take no chance.' As a skipper he was somewhat a disciplinarian, doubtless imbibed from his previous military experience in South Africa. Still, he treated us all like men, not kids, who were out to 'play the game' for good old New Zealand." Another contemporary said he was "perhaps not the greatest of wing-forwards, as such; but he was acutely skilled as a judge of men and moves".

Paul Verdon, in his history of All Black captains, "Born to Lead", writes: "The overwhelming evidence suggests Gallaher's leadership style, honed from time spent in the Boer War, was very effective." Gallaher's biographer Matt Elliott asserts that in the century since his playing retirement "his reputation as a player and leader have only enhanced". According to historian Terry McLean: "In a long experience of reading and hearing about the man, one has never encountered, from the New Zealand angle, or from his fellow players, criticism of his qualities as a leader." In the view of the English rugby journalist <a href="E.%20H.%20D.%20Sewell">E. H. D. Sewell</a>, writing soon after Gallaher's death, the New Zealand captain was "a very quiet, taciturn sort of cove, who spoke rarely about football or his own achievements ... I never heard a soul who met him on that famous trip, say a disparaging word about him."

Homicide: Life on the Street (season 1)

The first season of "", an American <a href="police%20procedural">police procedural</a> drama television series, originally aired in the United States on <a href="NBC">NBC</a> between January 31 and March 31, 1993. The show was created by <a href="Paul%20Attanasio">Paul Attanasio</a>, with film director <a href="Barry%20Levinson">Barry Levinson</a> and television writer and producer <a href="Tom%20Fontana">Tom Fontana</a> serving as executive producers. Adapted from <a href="David%20Simon">David Simon</a>'s 1991 non-fiction book "", the season followed the fictional detectives of <a href="Baltimore%20Police%20Department">Baltimore Police Department</a> homicide unit and the murder cases they investigate. The show was broadcast on Wednesdays at 9 p.m. <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">EST</a>, with the exception of the series premiere, which aired immediately after <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XXVII">Super Bowl XXVII</a>.

The season introduced regular cast members <a href="Daniel%20Baldwin">Daniel Baldwin</a>, <a href="Ned%20Beatty">Ned Beatty</a>, <a href="Richard%20Belzer">Richard Belzer</a>, <a href="Andre%20Braugher">Andre Braugher</a>, <a href="Clark%20Johnson">Clark Johnson</a>, <a href="Yaphet%20Kotto">Yaphet Kotto</a>, <a href="Melissa%20Leo">Melissa Leo</a>, <a href="Jon%20Polito">Jon Polito</a> and <a href="Kyle%20Secor">Kyle Secor</a>. Most of the primary characters were based on real-life <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a> detectives from Simon's book, including <a href="Gary%20D%27Addario">Gary D'Addario</a>, <a href="Terrence%20McLarney">Terrence McLarney</a>, <a href="Harry%20Edgerton">Harry Edgerton</a>, <a href="Donald%20Worden">Donald Worden</a> and <a href="Jay%20Landsman">Jay Landsman</a>. Many of the first season story arcs were also adapted from the book, most notably the 1988 Baltimore slaying of 11-year-old Latonya Kim Wallace, which was the basis for the murder case of Adena Watson in "Homicide". Another multi-episode arc included <a href="Lee%20Tergesen">Lee Tergesen</a> as an officer who is friends with the homicide squad and later gets shot. "<a href="Night%20of%20the%20Dead%20Living">Night of the Dead Living</a>", originally written as the third episode, was moved to become the season finale at the insistence of NBC executives, which led to several notable continuity errors.

The first season received consistently positive reviews, with several commentators declaring it one of the best shows on television at the time. The episode "<a href="Three%20Men%20and%20Adena">Three Men and Adena</a>", which consists almost entirely of one police interrogation with three actors, received particularly positive reviews and was declared one of the 100 greatest television moments by "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>". The series premiere, "<a href="Gone%20for%20Goode">Gone for Goode</a>", opened to a season-high viewership of 18.2 million households due to a lead-in from the <a href="Super%20Bowl">Super Bowl</a>. The <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen ratings</a> declined throughout the season, which "Homicide" producers attributed to a poor time-slot and heavy competition from the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> comedies "<a href="Home%20Improvement%20%28TV%20series%29">Home Improvement</a>" and "<a href="Coach%20%28TV%20series%29">Coach</a>". The ratings led NBC executives to demand changes to the show before renewing "Homicide" for a second season.

"Homicide: Life on the Street" received four <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a> nominations during its first season and won two, and also received a <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America">Writers Guild of America</a> award and a <a href="Directors%20Guild%20of%20America%20Award">Directors Guild of America Award</a>. The first and second seasons of "Homicide" were released together in a four-<a href="DVD">DVD</a> box-set on May 27, 2003.

Film director <a href="Barry%20Levinson">Barry Levinson</a> sought to create a police drama television series based on "", a 1991 non-fiction book by <a href="David%20Simon">David Simon</a> based on one year he spent with <a href="Baltimore%20Police%20Department">Baltimore Police Department</a> homicide detectives. In addition to the book's being set in Levinson's home city of Baltimore, the director was attracted to the realistic way Simon portrayed police work and the detectives. The book contradicted many popular myths that had been built into past police dramas: it portrayed the detectives as not always getting along with each other and told stories of criminals who were not always caught or punished. It also portrayed detectives as solving cases primarily through physical evidence, witnesses and confessions, not by investigating motives like on many other police shows. Simon also sought to dispel the popular television perception that all detectives take their cases very personally and identify with their victims: in Simon's experience, homicide cases were primarily a job to the detectives, not personal. Levinson and <a href="Tom%20Fontana">Tom Fontana</a>, who had past television experience as executive producer on the drama series "<a href="St.%20Elsewhere">St. Elsewhere</a>", hired screenwriter <a href="Paul%20Attanasio">Paul Attanasio</a> to adapt elements of the book into the teleplay for the first episode. It was the first television script Attanasio ever wrote.

Attanasio based the characters in "Homicide" on the detectives featured in Simon's book. Frank Pembleton was based on Detective <a href="Harry%20Edgerton">Harry Edgerton</a>, although the two were so different that both the producers and detectives agreed their only true similarity was that they were black. Meldrick Lewis was only loosely based on Detective Donald Waltemeyer, and Levinson admitted Lewis did not start to become strongly developed until because, "I thought it'd be great to have a character who was totally unwilling to share with the people he worked with." Tim Bayliss was based on the real-life Baltimore detective Tom Pellegrini, the primary detective who investigated the 1988 Baltimore slaying of 11-year-old Latonya Kim Wallace. The extremely personal approach Bayliss took in attempting to solve Adena Watson's murder, and his strong disappointment over failing to solve it, was based on the emotions Pellegrini went through in the Wallace case. Pellegrini provided advice to actor Kyle Secor about how to play the Bayliss role.

The part of John Munch was based on <a href="Jay%20Landsman">Jay Landsman</a>, a practical joker who was known in his homicide unit for his morbid wit. Both Belzer and the character Munch he portrays are cynical, caustic former <a href="hippie">hippie</a>s who are so similar that Belzer declared the character "exactly as I would be if I were a cop". Stanley Bolander was inspired by Detective <a href="Donald%20Worden">Donald Worden</a> who, like his on-screen counterpart, was nicknamed "The Big Man". Ned Beatty only met Worden once before taking on the role, and he said the detective had "an uncluttered mind and a near-photographic memory". Beau Felton was based on Detective Donald Kincaid, and Felton's clashes with Pembleton were based on Kincaid's real-life strong dislike for Harry Edgerton. Kay Howard was based in part on the female Detective Bert Silver, and in part on the male Detective Rich Garvey, who experienced a real-life string of good luck in solving consecutive cases, just as Howard did in the first season.

<a href="NBC">NBC</a> ordered a full season of "Homicide: Life on the Street" before a <a href="television%20pilot">pilot episode</a> was even produced. Planned as a mid-season replacement, the network ordered six episodes for their 1993 winter season, and then ordered another three after watching the completed pilot episode. The network had been consistently placing third behind their competitor networks <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> and <a href="CBS">CBS</a>, and was suffering due to the loss of several successful shows in 1992, including "<a href="The%20Cosby%20Show">The Cosby Show</a>", "<a href="The%20Golden%20Girls">The Golden Girls</a>" and "<a href="Matlock%20%28TV%20series%29">Matlock</a>", as well as the upcoming end of "<a href="Cheers">Cheers</a>" in 1993. NBC had tried appealing to audiences in their 20s through several comedies, but those efforts proved unsuccessful and the network decided to focus on high-quality dramas like "Homicide". NBC Entertainment president <a href="Warren%20Littlefield">Warren Littlefield</a> considered it the most promising new series of the season.

<a href="Paul%20Attanasio">Paul Attanasio</a> was billed as the creator of "Homicide: Life on the Street", with Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana serving as executive producers. The show was produced by Levinson's company <a href="Baltimore%20Pictures">Baltimore Pictures</a>, which partnered with <a href="Alan%20Landsburg%20Productions">Reeves Entertainment</a>. <a href="Wayne%20Ewing">Wayne Ewing</a>, who was cinematographer for Levinson's film "<a href="Toys%20%28film%29">Toys</a>" (1992), was director of photography during the first season and also directed the episode "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes".

Stan Warnow started out working as editor on the season premiere "Gone for Goode", but he departed before the process was done due to creative differences with Levinson. Tony Black finished the editing for that episode, but did not return for the rest of the season. <a href="Jay%20Rabinowitz%20%28editor%29">Jay Rabinowitz</a> worked as editor for the remaining episodes, along with editors Cindy Mollo and Richard Harkness. <a href="Van%20Smith">Van Smith</a> designed the costumes for "Gone for Goode", but he did not return to work on subsequent episodes, where the costumes were handled by Rolande Berman.

The real-life detectives portrayed in "Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets" signed waivers allowing themselves to be portrayed in the show, and some became consultants for the series. <a href="Gary%20D%27Addario">Gary D'Addario</a>, the homicide lieutenant with the Baltimore Police Department and inspiration for the Al "Gee" Giardello character, worked as a consultant and approved the teleplays for accuracy. Fontana said of the real-life detectives' contributions: "They have great stories, and the rhythms of their different personalities are so special that it's great to have them around."

Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana took the unusual step of basing the ethnicity and gender of the characters on the actors they cast, even though the roles were based on real-life detectives. For example, the role of Frank Pembleton, although based on the African-American Detective Harry Edgerton, was not race-specific until Andre Braugher auditioned and was cast. This impressed Braugher, who believed fully developed roles were often written for white characters and black roles were generally two-dimensional and stereotypical. This belief developed in part from Braugher's poor experience playing Detective Winston Blake on the television series "<a href="Kojak">Kojak</a>", where he objected to the show's treatment of race. Ned Beatty, the best-known member of cast when the series debuted, was personally approached by Levinson and Fontana to play Stanley Bolander. Although Beatty respected the two men and liked the show, he was reluctant to take the role because he believed NBC would corrupt the series and change it to a typical police show. Beatty claimed his agents and managers "pushed, dragged and hauled" him into meeting with Levinson, but Beatty ultimately accepted the role. Kyle Secor was cast as Tim Bayliss by Fontana, who remembered the actor from his role as gay <a href="AIDS">AIDS</a> patient Bret Johnson in Fontana's previous show, "St. Elsewhere".

In casting Al "Gee" Giardello, Levinson decided not to make the character Italian-American like the real-life counterpart Gary D'Addario, but rather cast Yaphet Kotto and made the character a Sicilian-African American. Kotto, who turned down two feature film offers to accept the "Homicide" role, was extremely impressed with Levinson's choices for the character, saying, "They had the daring to make the artistic choice without prejudice of any kind. I don't think there's another network show on the air with this sort of cast composition." Kotto struggled at first with the show's production style and constantly moving camera style, which flustered him and made him forget his lines. Levinson had to personally reassure him that he could handle the part. Clark Johnson was cast as Meldrick Lewis, and Jon Polito as his partner, Steve Crosetti. When Polito first auditioned, he read the role of a Polish cop, then did a second reading for an Irish role based on Detective Sergeant <a href="Terrence%20McLarney">Terrence McLarney</a>. He was cast in the McLarney role, but it was rewritten to an Italian character for Polito. The actor found working on "Homicide" intense and demanding, claiming, "Everybody's working so hard. This is much more of a theater atmosphere."
The first "Homicide" season featured the first performances of Richard Belzer as Detective John Munch, a character the actor has been credited for in 459 television episodes () in <a href="John%20Munch%23Appearances%20and%20crossovers">nine different television series</a>, including "Homicide" and "". Levinson asked Belzer to audition for the part after hearing the comedian ranting on "<a href="The%20Howard%20Stern%20Show">The Howard Stern Show</a>", where Belzer was a frequent guest. Levinson said Belzer was a "lousy actor" during his first audition with the "Gone for Goode" script. Levinson asked Belzer to take some time to reread and practice the material, then come back and read it again. During his second reading, Levinson said Belzer was "still terrible", but that the actor eventually found confidence in his performance. Daniel Baldwin was cast as Beau Felton, and dyed his naturally blond hair black for the role. Baldwin became one of the most vocal supporters of the show, giving many press interviews about it and defending it amid declining ratings. Baldwin declared, ""Homicide" is the best material I've had the chance to do." Melissa Leo was cast as Kay Howard, which was considered a particularly strong part compared to other female characters in police dramas at the time, which were usually limited to love interests or minor parts. While most cast members shadowed real-life Baltimore detectives to prepare for the roles, Leo did not because, she said, "I don't like to look at the horror that's in the world." Wendy Hughes was cast as medical examiner Carol Blythe.

The first season also introduced several minor characters that would make recurring appearances throughout the rest of the series. Colonel Burt Granger and Captain <a href="George%20Barnfather">George Barnfather</a>, the Baltimore Police Department bosses, were introduced in the second episode, "Ghost of a Chance". They were played, respectively, by Gerald F. Gough and <a href="Clayton%20LeBouef">Clayton LeBouef</a>, the latter of whom later portrayed drug front worker-turned-informer <a href="Barksdale%20Organization%23Wendell%20%26quot%3BOrlando%26quot%3B%20Blocker">Wendell "Orlando" Blocker</a> in David Simon's other police drama, "<a href="The%20Wire">The Wire</a>". Also introduced in "Ghost of a Chance" was prosecutor <a href="Ed%20Danvers">Ed Danvers</a>, who was played by <a href="%C5%BDeljko%20Ivanek">Željko Ivanek</a>, a long-time friend of Tom Fontana. The executive producer felt Danvers was written in a dull and simple way, but felt confident Ivanek could "make it a real character". Ami Brabson, the real-life wife of actor Andre Braugher, played Mary Pembleton, the spouse of Braugher's detective counterpart character. Brabson auditioned for the role shortly after Braugher was cast in the series, and Braugher said of their on-screen pairing, "We have an instant rapport that we don't have to create." <a href="Michael%20Willis">Michael Willis</a> made his first of several appearances as defense attorney Darin Russom in the first season. Willis also later appeared in "The Wire" as the corrupt property developer <a href="Politicians%20of%20The%20Wire%23Andy%20Krawczyk">Andy Krawczyk</a>.

<a href="Lee%20Tergesen">Lee Tergesen</a> played Officer Chris Thormann, a patrolman who is shot in the head and blinded. His wife, Eva Thormann, was portrayed by <a href="Edie%20Falco">Edie Falco</a>, whom Fontana cast after watching her performance in "<a href="Laws%20of%20Gravity%20%28film%29">Laws of Gravity</a>" (1992). Fontana was so impressed with Falco's work in "Homicide" that he later cast her in his <a href="HBO">HBO</a> series "<a href="Oz%20%28TV%20series%29">Oz</a>". Film and theater actor <a href="Moses%20Gunn">Moses Gunn</a>'s final performance before his death was as Risley Tucker, a murder suspect questioned for 12 hours by Pembleton and Bayliss in "Three Men and Adena". Several other notable actors made guest appearances throughout the first season of "Homicide", including <a href="Gwen%20Verdon">Gwen Verdon</a>, <a href="Luis%20Guzm%C3%A1n">Luis Guzmán</a>, <a href="Paul%20Schulze">Paul Schulze</a>, <a href="Walt%20MacPherson">Walt MacPherson</a>, <a href="Bai%20Ling">Bai Ling</a>, <a href="Lisa%20Gay%20Hamilton">Lisa Gay Hamilton</a>, <a href="Steve%20Harris%20%28actor%29">Steve Harris</a>, <a href="Alexander%20Chaplin">Alexander Chaplin</a>, <a href="N%27Bushe%20Wright">N'Bushe Wright</a>, and Baltimore filmmaker John Waters. <a href="Larry%20Gilliard%2C%20Jr.">Larry Gilliard, Jr.</a>, who later starred as drug dealer <a href="D%27Angelo%20Barksdale">D'Angelo Barksdale</a> in "The Wire", made a brief appearance in the "Homicide" episode "A Dog and Pony Show". <a href="Mel%20Proctor">Mel Proctor</a>, then the home team sports announcer for the <a href="Washington%20Bullets">Washington Bullets</a>, made his first of five guest performances in "Son of a Gun" as recurring reporter character Grant Besser. Detective Tom Pellegrini, the basis for the Tim Bayliss character, made an on-screen cameo in "Ghost of a Chance" as the police officer who discovered Adena Watson's body.

"Homicide: Life on the Street" was unique among police dramas for weaving multiple intricate story-lines into single episodes; the season premiere "Gone for Goode", for example, included four separate subplots. As the first season of "Homicide" progressed, NBC officials complained to the show's producers about the large number of subplots, but the producers resisted the pressure to scale them back until the . Despite intense advance promotion of the "Homicide" premiere due to a planned <a href="Super%20Bowl">Super Bowl</a> lead-in, Attanasio deliberately sought to introduce the show with little fanfare, avoiding sensational gimmicks in favor of character-driven plot, quirky dialogue and morbid dark humor. "Homicide" was noted for its deliberate lack of gun-play and car chases in favor of dialogue and story. The writers also wanted the dialogue to reflect the kinds of things detectives would talk about when not discussing murders or cases, which led to the inclusion of several scenes in which detectives talk casually among themselves during lunch or around the office. One of the "running gags" was Crosetti's obsession of the Lincoln assassination and his quest to discover the "truth" and his arguments with Lewis or anyone else willing to listen. Fontana, who compared the scenes to Levinson's 1982 film "<a href="Diner%20%28film%29">Diner</a>", said, "That really made the show different from other shows, because we had the room to have conversations that seemingly didn't [storywise] connect anything, but they did reveal a lot about the characters."

"Gone for Goode" included several storylines, and even exact bits of dialogue, adapted straight from "Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets". One of the biggest story arcs from the first season was the murder of 11-year-old Adena Watson, which is introduced in "Gone for Goode" and lasts for five episodes until "Three Men and Adena". The case was based on the murder of 11-year-old Latonya Kim Wallace, which made up a major part of Simon's book. The Watson case, like the Wallace case, ultimately goes unsolved. A subplot from "Gone for Goode" and "Son of a Gun" involved the investigation into Calpurnia Smith, an elderly woman suspected of murdering five husbands in order to collect their life insurance policies. This was based on the real-life case of Geraldine Parrish, who was also accused of killing five husbands for insurance money, and was eventually convicted for three of their murders. Another multi-episode arc involved the near-fatal shooting of Patrolman Chris Thormann, which leaves the officer blind. This was also adapted from true-life events in Simon's book, although "Homicide" writers added the twist of Steve Crosetti taking the case personally based on his close friendship with the victim.

Attanasio, Levinson and Fontana strove to make "Homicide" more realistic than other police dramas, even in minor details. For example, Levinson specifically asked that a dead body found by detectives in "Gone for Goode" be badly decomposing and attracting flies because he felt other shows did not portray corpses in a realistic way. Some episodes, like "Ghost of a Chance", focus on murders that take place in wealthy rural settings, rather than an urban or predominantly poorer location as most police dramas did. "Homicide" was noted for demonstrating better than most American television police shows that murders can take place in various socioeconomic circumstances. In striving for realism, some cases in "Homicide" remain unsolved and murderers go free, most notably in the Adena Watson case. This theme often put the show's producers at odds with NBC executives, who wanted happier endings with more closure. Fontana said of the Watson investigation, "We never solved it because we felt that it would be a disservice to the real girl, to have this fake TV solution. Because it's not O.K. that she died, that no one took responsibility."

The writers also used details from real-life criminal investigations in their script. During one scene in "Ghost of a Chance", a busload of rookie police officers straight out of the academy are brought in to investigate a crime scene. The <a href="New%20York%20Police%20Department">New York Police Department</a> employed exactly the same tactic while searching for the remains of a missing girl in upstate <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> in 1987. One episode written by Tom Fontana, "Three Men and Adena", took place entirely within the confines of the police interrogation room known colloquially by the detectives as "The Box". Fontana was partially inspired to write it by comments made by Barry Levinson during filming of an interrogation scene in "Gone for Goode", when Levinson said the acting by Braugher and Secor was so good, an entire episode could be filmed around it. Fontana acknowledged a certain amount of risk in producing such an unusual episode in only the fifth week of the show, but he said, "It was important for [exec producer] Barry Levinson and I to establish that we weren't going to do the same old show every week." Multiple police departments have requested copies of "Three Men and Adena" for use in training sessions due to its accurate portrayal of the intricacies of the police interrogation process.

"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" was originally supposed to be the first-season finale, while "Night of the Dead Living" was meant to be the third episode. However, NBC programmers felt it was too slow-paced to run so early in the season: the episode takes place entirely within the squad room and lacked traditional police drama action, which NBC executives felt was not appropriate for an early stage when the series was still trying to woo viewers. As a result, "Night of the Dead Living" was shown out of sequence and made the season finale. This created several notable continuity errors. For example, Officer Chris Thormann has not yet been shot and blinded in "Night of the Dead Living", and Tim Bayliss is still working on the Adena Watson case, which was already ended earlier in the season. These errors were addressed by "Homicide" producers by adding the words "One hot night, last September ..." to the beginning of the episode, thus establishing the events of the episode took place within the correct timeline of the series, even though the episodes are shown out of order.

The inaugural season of "Homicide" established a realistic visual style that would remain largely intact throughout the duration of the series. Among the stylistic elements were the near-constant movement with hand-held <a href="16%20mm%20film">Super 16</a> cameras to give the show a naturalistic <a href="Documentary%20film">documentary</a> look and an editing style involving <a href="jump%20cut">jump cut</a>s that was unusual for television at the time. Wayne Ewing had used Super 16 cameras while filming promotional material for "Toys", and that format allowed "Homicide" producers to film cheaply and with a smaller crew, giving them more time to focus on the actor's performances. While filming, Levinson said he would simply allow the actors to perform while he switched back and forth between them with the hand-held camera instead of filming carefully planned shots and individual scenes from multiple angles. Levinson said the camera and editing style was partially inspired by the <a href="Jean-Luc%20Godard">Jean-Luc Godard</a> film "<a href="Breathless%20%281960%20film%29">Breathless</a>" (1960), which he would often ask his directors to watch before filming "Homicide" episodes.

Some individual scenes involved several jump cuts repeated several times in fast succession. Another unusual stylistic element used throughout the season involved sudden changes in jump-screen direction; a shot with an actor looking from left to right might immediately jump to another shot of the same actor looking from right to left. This process came from Levinson's insistence that the footage be edited together to include the actor's best performances. While editing "Gone for Goode", Tony Black cut together two shots that did not match and began looking for a <a href="cutaway%20%28filmmaking%29">cutaway</a> shot he could use to disguise the edit. Levinson liked the technique that came from cutting the two conflicting shots together and insisted it stay in. This technique became commonly used throughout the series, although it was toned down in future seasons at the insistence of NBC executives who found it too unconventional.
Like the rest of the series, the scenes for the first-season episodes were shot on-location in Baltimore. The use of hand-held cameras allowed the film to be shot more easily in the city, rather than on a sound-stage in Los Angeles or New York City, where most shows are typically shot. Levinson said being on location at all times allowed Baltimore "to be a character in the show". The Recreation Pier Building, a <a href="Fells%20Point%2C%20Baltimore">Fells Point</a> structure built in 1914 which once housed Baltimore's marine police, was used as the set of the police department station, which was the principal set for the show. The building looked so realistic that Baltimore residents would occasionally wander into it to report actual crimes. Production director Vincent Peranino created the squad room set inside the Recreation Pier Building. While most sets include a few fake walls opposite an open space for the cameras and crew, Peranino designed the entire room as if it were a real setting, including separate areas for the detectives' coffee room and the interrogation room known as "The Box". The actors began storing their actual belongings at their desks on the set, left real personal messages to each other on the bulletin boards, and got business cards with their characters' actual names for their desks.

Many other scenes in "Homicide" were filmed primarily in the Fells Point neighborhood, including actual streets, bars and houses to create authenticity. Scenes at the "Homicide" morgue were filmed inside Baltimore's actual Office of the Medical Examiner, which the actors hated performing in due to the unsettling atmosphere; Ned Beatty said of filming there, "The one thing you can't get on camera is, oh boy, it smells." "Homicide" footage was transferred from film to videotape for editing at the Maryland studio Colorlab Motion Picture Services. There, Levinson and Ewing worked with colorist Drexel Williams to drain the footage of color value, leaving a gritty visual style almost reminiscent of black-and-white. This technique was downplayed starting in the second season, giving the show a more colorful look.

The opening credits for season one were developed by <a href="Mark%20Pellington">Mark Pellington</a>, a director and Baltimore native. Pellington filmed the images used in the credits with an <a href="8%20mm%20film">8 mm camera</a> to give it a gritty look. Levinson and Fontana wanted images of all the regular cast members in the credits, but wanted a different approach than the typical image of an actor looking at the camera, which they felt was a television cliche. Instead, Pellington included each of their images, but in quick close-up shots using a variety of lighting methods and camera angles; the names were only shown after the last close-up, and not in the same order. This approach was used until the beginning of the show's .

The theme song for "Homicide: Life on the Street" was composed by Lynn F. Kowal, who submitted one of several tapes sent to the producers for consideration. "Homicide" producers initially had trouble finding the right song, and Levinson ultimately chose Kowal's themes because, while most of the candidates too closely resembled typical television theme songs, Levinson felt Kowal's song "had that odd quality to it, drums or whatever, and it was very unusual". Music is presented in various ways throughout the first season of "Homicide". Some songs are played on radios that play in the homicide squad room, like "Lay Down My Life" by <a href="Carole%20King">Carole King</a>, "Texas Slide" by <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Milteau">Jean-Jacques Milteau</a>, "N.Y.C (Can You Believe This City?)" by <a href="Charles%20%26amp%3B%20Eddie">Charles & Eddie</a>, "Little Boy Blues" and "Break Up" by <a href="http%3A//www.fitzmusic.com">Gary Fitzgerald</a>, and "Tropic Call" by Mitchell Coodley and Andrew Snitzer, all of which are featured in "Night of the Dead Living". Other songs are more integrated into the show itself, like "Hazy Shade of Blue", a <a href="Tor%20Hyams">Tor Hyams</a> song that plays while the police raid several neighborhood homes in search of clues during "Ghost of a Chance", and the hymn "<a href="In%20the%20Sweet%20By%20and%20By">The Sweet By and By</a>", which is sung at a church during Adena Watson's funeral in that same episode. Several other songs are featured in episodes throughout the first season, including "Elephant Walk" by "<a href="The%20Kings">The Kings</a>", "<a href="The%20Beat%20Goes%20On%20%28Sonny%20%26amp%3B%20Cher%20song%29">The Beat Goes On</a>" by <a href="Sonny%20Bono">Sonny Bono</a>, "Going' Around in Circles" by <a href="Jules%20Taub">Jules Taub</a>, "Telephone Blues" by <a href="Sam%20Ling">Sam Ling</a> and <a href="George%20%26quot%3BHarmonica%26quot%3B%20Smith">George Smith</a>, and "<a href="It%27s%20So%20Hard%20to%20Say%20Goodbye%20to%20Yesterday">It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday</a>" by <a href="Freddie%20Perren">Freddie Perren</a> and Christine Yarian.

Reviews were consistently positive from the beginning of the series. "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" television critic <a href="Tom%20Shales">Tom Shales</a> called "Homicide" "the least compromised and the most intense" drama show on television, adding, "In every department, the level of excellence has been awesome." Shales complimented it for portraying the tension of a homicide squad without resorting to gratuitous violence. <a href="Harold%20Schindler">Harold Schindler</a> of "<a href="The%20Salt%20Lake%20Tribune">The Salt Lake Tribune</a>" said the series "ranks among the best programs of their kind to appear on television anywhere". He praised the acting and called the filming style "camera vérité at its best without actually becoming a documentary". Lon Grahnke of the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>" called it "the season's best new series of any genre", praising it for not depending on action sequences and claiming it "has the spice, dry wit and ethnic diversity of the "<a href="Hill%20Street%20Blues">Hill Street Blues</a>" crew, with even more eccentricities and a heightened sense of realism". Paul Lomartire of "<a href="The%20Palm%20Beach%20Post">The Palm Beach Post</a>" called it "the best new drama to come along on any network since NBC canceled "<a href="Shannon%27s%20Deal">Shannon's Deal</a>"". "<a href="Newsday">Newsday</a>" critic <a href="Marvin%20Kitman">Marvin Kitman</a> called "Homicide" "an old-fashioned NBC signature show" remnisicent of the network during the time of <a href="Grant%20Tinker">Grant Tinker</a> and <a href="Brandon%20Tartikoff">Brandon Tartikoff</a>.

<a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> writer Scott Williams praised the series as unique: "It had superb writing, a gifted cast that created complex, fully realized characters, a unique visual style, and stories of compelling power and intensity." "<a href="Knight%20Ridder">Knight Ridder Newspapers</a>" television writer Mike Duffy praised what he called the show's witty writing, stylish visuals and superb acting, and declared it the best police drama since "<a href="Hill%20Street%20Blues">Hill Street Blues</a>". The <a href="E.%20W.%20Scripps%20Company">Scripps Howard News Service</a> called "Homicide" "the best new drama of the season", and "<a href="The%20Buffalo%20News">The Buffalo News</a>" writer Alan Pergament ranked it among the ten best television shows of 1993. Eric Kohanik of "<a href="The%20Hamilton%20Spectator">The Hamilton Spectator</a>" called it "the best new series of the midseason", and praised it for not resorting to "silly car chases [and] blazing guns". Not all reviews were positive. James Endrst, television columnist for "<a href="The%20Hartford%20Courant">The Hartford Courant</a>", felt the series was over-hyped and said "seen it, done it, been there before" of the filming techniques otherwise being praised as cutting edge. In writing about "Gone for Goode", "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" reviewer Richard Zoglin praised the "strong cast" and said he appreciated the lack of violence, but said, "the characters are too pat, their conflicts too predictable", particularly the rookie character Bayliss.

"<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" writer John O'Connor praised the acting and originality of the series, which he called "simultaneously funny and harrowing". He also said "Homicide" occasionally gratuitously emphasized style over substance in an attempt to be original, "[as if] trying to signal, 'See how much better we are than ordinary television.'" Many commentators were impressed with the high number of strong, complex, well-developed and non-stereotypical <a href="African%20American">African American</a> characters like Pembleton, Lewis and Giardello. When the show risked facing cancellation due to poor <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen ratings</a>, <a href="Benjamin%20Hooks">Benjamin Hooks</a>, executive director of the <a href="National%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Colored%20People">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a>, took what was considered an unusual move and wrote a letter to NBC Entertainment president Warren Littlefield urging the network not to cancel "Homicide". Hooks said the show presented many positive portrayals of African Americans, as well as "a compelling and realistic rendering of today's multiracial and multicultural urban society".

"Three Men and Adena" received especially positive reviews and has been described as one of the "classic episodes" of "Homicide: Life on the Street". It ranked number 74 in an "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" list of the 100 greatest television moments, and number 15 among the top television moments from the 1990s. David Bianculli of the "<a href="Daily%20News%20%28New%20York%29">New York Daily News</a>" said the episode "remains one of TV's best drama hours ever", "Entertainment Weekly" writer Bruce Fretts said the episode was "one of the most powerful prime-time hours ever" and literary critic <a href="John%20Leonard%20%28critic%29">John Leonard</a> called it "the most extraordinary thing I've ever seen in a television hour". Emily Nussbaum of "The New York Times" called "Three Men and Adena" the standout episode of the series, and described it as "a potent showcase for the series' smartly mordant dialogue, and its willingness to explore the cliches of TV detectives instead of merely repeating them".

The series premiered on January 31, 1993, in the time slot immediately following <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XXVII">Super Bowl XXVII</a>. Having consistently placed third in the Nielsen ratings during prime time since September 1992, NBC hoped a large football audience coupled with an extensive advertising campaign would allow "Homicide: Life on the Street" to give the network a large ratings boost. NBC ran numerous television commercials advertising the premiere episode, some of which focused on the involvement of Barry Levinson with the hope of capitalizing on the feature film director's household name. "Gone for Goode" was seen by 18.24 million household viewers, which was largest viewership of the first season, and marked the best ratings performance of a preview or premiere following a Super Bowl since "<a href="The%20Wonder%20Years">The Wonder Years</a>" in 1988. Nevertheless, NBC considered it a disappointing performance based on the amount of advertising and press coverage the episode received. "Gone for Goode" received less than half the audience that the Super Bowl itself did.

Ratings for "Homicide: Life on the Street" gradually declined throughout the first season, and it ultimately finished 99th in the Nielsen ratings among network shows for the season. It aired Wednesdays at 9 p.m. <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">EST</a> and was consistently defeated in the ratings by a high-rating comedy block featuring "<a href="Home%20Improvement%20%28TV%20series%29">Home Improvement</a>" and "<a href="Coach%20%28TV%20series%29">Coach</a>" on ABC. Barry Levinson said the scheduling was a serious detriment to "Homicide" which, like many other drama series at the time, was designed for a 10 p.m. time-slot. Tom Fontana also believed "Homicide" suffered in the ratings because it aired between "<a href="Unsolved%20Mysteries">Unsolved Mysteries</a>" and "<a href="Law%20%26amp%3B%20Order">Law & Order</a>", which he believed was too many police dramas for one night: "I never understood the concept of three hours of people in handcuffs as a way to entice an audience."

Viewership also suffered in part due to heavy competition in its time-slot from several major television events, such as a live <a href="Oprah%20Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a> 90-minute interview with pop singer <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a> on February 10, the <a href="35th%20Grammy%20Awards">35th Grammy Awards</a> ceremony on February 24, and the Sixth Annual <a href="American%20Comedy%20Awards">American Comedy Awards</a> on March 3. As the ratings declined, NBC announced to fans that a decision about whether "Homicide" would be renewed or canceled would depend on how the last four episodes of the season fared in the ratings. During the first week of March, the network started airing a television commercial with Barry Levinson making a direct appeal to viewers to watch the show, in which he said:

"Homicide" was considered at high risk of cancellation by the end of the first season. When questioned, NBC spokesman Curt Block only said the network was "on the fence" about the series. By the time the season ended, four additional scripts had already been written, but NBC executives asked for several refinements – including fewer episode subplots and less camera movements and jump cuts – before approving a . Fontana said he was willing "to do anything to keep NBC from forgetting us", although Levinson said the show would maintain its realistic visual style, claiming, "We want a camera that's almost a participant in the show." "Homicide" was ultimately renewed, but the producers slightly toned down the show's bleak visual style and hand-held photography motif, and focused more strongly on single stories rather than multiple subplots. Tom Fontana said of the changes to the series, "We were experimenting with our first nine episodes. Whenever you try something new, you tend to err on the side of breaking ground. But we'd rather have more people watching, so the colors and lighting are slightly brighter, and the camera movements are not as jarring."

"Homicide: Life on the Street" won two <a href="Emmy%20Awards">Emmy Awards</a> during its first season and received two additional nominations. Barry Levinson won an Emmy for <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Directing%20for%20a%20Drama%20Series">Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series</a> for his work on "Gone for Goode" and Tom Fontana won for <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Writing%20%E2%80%93%20Drama%20Series">Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series</a> for the "Three Men and Adena" script. After winning his Emmy, Fontana made an emotional acceptance speech about the need to save the hour-long television drama, in which he said: "It's not the fault of the American public that the drama is in trouble. It's us: the writers, producers, the network executives, the studio money-crunchers. We have to figure out a way to reignite the imagination of the American people." Fontana said of the response to his speech:

I didn't think I was going to win, but I decided if they were going to give it to me, I was going to yell ... Writers told me, 'Boy, you really gave it to the producers.' Producers told me, 'Boy, you really stuck it to the networks.' The networks told me, 'Boy, you really hammered the studios.' Nobody got to the point. I was indicting all of us. What is frustrating about this is nothing has changed. Everybody wants to do everything the way it has been done 100 times before.

<a href="Mark%20Pellington">Mark Pellington</a> received a <a href="Creative%20Arts%20Emmy%20Award">Creative Arts Emmy</a> nomination for the main title sequence of the show, and Gwen Verdon was nominated for the Emmy for <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Guest%20Actress%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20Drama%20Series">Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series</a> her guest performance in "Ghost of a Chance" as Jessie Doohan, an unhappily married woman accused of killing her husband of 60 years.

Operation Auca

Operation Auca was an attempt by five <a href="Evangelicalism">Evangelical</a> <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> <a href="missionary">missionaries</a> from the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> to bring Christianity to the <a href="Huaorani">Huaorani</a> people of the <a href="Amazon%20Rain%20forest">rain forest</a> of <a href="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>. The Huaorani, also known pejoratively as Aucas (a modification of "awqa", the <a href="Quechua%20language">Quechua</a> word for "savages"), were an isolated tribe known for their violence, against both their own people and outsiders who entered their territory. With the intention of being the first Christians to <a href="evangelism">evangelize</a> the previously <a href="Uncontacted%20peoples">uncontacted</a> Huaorani, the missionaries began making regular flights over Huaorani settlements in September 1955, dropping gifts, which were reciprocated. After several months of exchanging gifts, on January 3, 1956, the missionaries established a camp at "Palm Beach", a <a href="sandbar">sandbar</a> along the <a href="Curaray%20River">Curaray River</a>, a few kilometers from Huaorani settlements. Their efforts came to an end on January 8, 1956, when all five—<a href="Jim%20Elliot">Jim Elliot</a>, <a href="Nate%20Saint">Nate Saint</a>, <a href="Ed%20McCully">Ed McCully</a>, <a href="Peter%20Fleming%20%28missionary%29">Peter Fleming</a>, and <a href="Roger%20Youderian">Roger Youderian</a>—were attacked and <a href="spear">spear</a>ed by a group of Huaorani warriors. The news of their deaths was broadcast around the world, and "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" magazine covered the event with a photo essay.

The deaths of the men galvanized the missionary effort in the United States, sparking an outpouring of funding for evangelization efforts around the world. Their work is still frequently remembered in evangelical publications, and in 2006 was the subject of the film production "<a href="End%20of%20the%20Spear">End of the Spear</a>". Several years after the death of the men, the widow of Jim Elliot, <a href="Elisabeth%20Elliot">Elisabeth</a>, and the sister of Nate Saint, <a href="Rachel%20Saint">Rachel</a>, returned to Ecuador as missionaries with the Summer Institute of Linguistics (now <a href="SIL%20International">SIL International</a>) to live among the Huaorani. This eventually led to the conversion of many, including some of those involved in the killing. While largely eliminating tribal violence, their efforts exposed the tribe to increased influence from the outside.

The <a href="Huaorani%20people">Huaorani</a> around the time of Operation Auca were a small tribe occupying the jungle of <a href="Geography%20of%20Ecuador%23El%20Oriente%20%28the%20East%29%20Amazon%20Basin">Eastern Ecuador</a> between the <a href="Napo%20River">Napo</a> and <a href="Curaray">Curaray</a> Rivers, an area of approximately 20,000 square kilometers (7,700 mi²). They numbered approximately 600 people, and were split into three groups, all mutually hostile—the Geketaidi, the Baïidi, and the Wepeidi. They lived on the gathering and cultivation of plant foods like <a href="manioc">manioc</a> and <a href="Plantain%20%28cooking%29">plantain</a>s, as well as fishing and hunting with spear and <a href="blowgun">blowgun</a>. Family units consisted of a man and his wife or wives, their unmarried sons, their married daughters and sons-in-law, and their grandchildren. All of them would reside in a <a href="longhouse">longhouse</a>, which was separated by several kilometers from another longhouse in which close relatives lived. Marriage was always <a href="endogamy">endogenous</a> and typically <a href="inbreeding">between cousins</a>, and <a href="arranged%20marriage">arranged</a> by the parents of the young people.

Before their first peaceful contact with outsiders ("cowodi") in 1958, the Huaorani fiercely defended their territory. Viewing all "cowodi" as <a href="cannibalism">cannibalistic</a> predators, they killed <a href="rubber">rubber</a> tappers around the turn of the 20th century and <a href="Royal%20Dutch%20Shell">Shell Oil Company</a> employees during the 1940s, in addition to any lowland <a href="Quechuas">Quechua</a> or other outsiders who encroached on their land. Furthermore, they were prone to internal violence, often engaging in vengeance killing of other Huaorani. Raids were carried out in extreme anger by groups of men who attacked their victims' longhouse by night and then fled. Attempts to build truces through gifts and exchange of spouses became more frequent as their numbers decreased and the tribes fragmented, but the cycle of violence continued.

Jim Elliot first heard of the Huaorani in 1950 from a former missionary to Ecuador, and afterwards indicated that God had called him to Ecuador to evangelize the Huaorani. He began corresponding with his friend Pete Fleming about his desire to minister in Ecuador, and in 1952 the two men set sail for <a href="Guayaquil">Guayaquil</a> as missionaries with the <a href="Plymouth%20Brethren">Plymouth Brethren</a>. For six months they lived in <a href="Quito">Quito</a> with the goal of learning <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>. They then moved to <a href="Shandia">Shandia</a>, a Quechua <a href="mission%20%28station%29">mission station</a> deep in the Ecuadorian jungle. There they worked under the supervision of a Christian Missions in Many Lands missionary, Wilfred Tidmarsh, and began exposing themselves to the culture and studying the <a href="Quechua%20language">Quechua language</a>.

Another team member was Ed McCully, a man Jim Elliot had met and befriended while both attended <a href="Wheaton%20College%2C%20Illinois">Wheaton College</a>. Following graduation, he married Marilou Hobolth and enrolled in a one-year basic medical treatment program at the School of Missionary Medicine in <a href="Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Los Angeles</a>. On December 10, 1952, McCully moved to Quito with his family as a Plymouth Brethren missionary, planning to soon join Elliot and Fleming in Shandia. In 1953, however, the station in Shandia was wiped out by a flood, delaying their move until September of that year.

The team's pilot, Nate Saint, had served in the military during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, receiving flight training as a member of the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Corps">Army Air Corps</a>. After being discharged in 1946, he too studied at Wheaton College, but quit after a year and joined the <a href="Mission%20Aviation%20Fellowship">Mission Aviation Fellowship</a> in 1948. He and his wife Marj traveled to Ecuador by the end of the year, and they settled at MAF headquarters in <a href="Shell%20Mera">Shell Mera</a>. Shortly after his arrival, Saint began transporting supplies and equipment to missionaries spread throughout the jungle. This work ultimately led to his meeting the other four missionaries, who he joined in Operation Auca.

Also on the team was Roger Youderian, a 32-year-old missionary who had been working in Ecuador since 1953. Under the mission board <a href="Avant%20Ministries">Gospel Missionary Union</a>, he and his wife Barbara and daughter Beth settled in Macuma, a mission station in the southern jungle of Ecuador. There, he and his wife ministered to the <a href="Shuar%20people">Shuar</a> people, learning their language and transcribing it. After working with them for about a year, Youderian and his family began ministering to a tribe related to the Shuar, the Achuar people. He worked with Nate Saint to provide important medical supplies; but after a period of attempting to build relationships with them, he failed to see any positive effect and, growing depressed, considered returning to the United States. However, during this time Saint approached him about joining their team to meet the Huaorani, and he assented.

The first stage of Operation Auca began in September 1955. Saint, McCully, Elliot, and fellow missionary Johnny Keenan decided to initiate contact with the Huaorani and began periodically searching for them by air. By the end of the month, they had identified several clearings in the jungle. Meanwhile, Elliot learned several phrases in the language of the Huaorani from <a href="Dayuma">Dayuma</a>, a young Huaorani woman who had left her society and become friends with <a href="Rachel%20Saint">Rachel Saint</a>, a missionary and the sister of Nate Saint. The missionaries hoped that by regularly giving gifts to the Huaorani and attempting to communicate with them in their language, they would be able to win them over as friends.

Because of the difficulty and risk of meeting the Huaorani on the ground, the missionaries chose to drop gifts to the Huaorani by fixed-wing aircraft. Their drop technique, developed by Nate Saint, involved flying around the drop location in tight circles while lowering the gift from the plane on a rope. This kept the bundle in roughly the same position as it approached the ground. On October 6, 1955, Saint made the first drop, releasing a small kettle containing <a href="Button%20%28clothing%29">button</a>s and <a href="halite">rock salt</a>. The gift-giving continued during the following weeks, with the missionaries dropping <a href="machete">machete</a>s, ribbons, clothing, pots, and various trinkets.

After several visits to the Auca village, which the missionaries called "Terminal City", they observed that the Huaorani seemed excited to receive their gifts. Encouraged, they began using a loudspeaker to shout simple Huaorani phrases as they circled. After several more drops, in November the Huaorani began tying gifts for the missionaries to the line after removing the gifts the missionaries gave them. The men took this as a gesture of friendliness and developed plans for meeting the Huaorani on the ground. Saint soon identified a 200-yard (200 m) sandbar along the <a href="Curaray%20River">Curaray River</a> about 4.5 miles (7 km) from Terminal City that could serve as a runway and camp site, and dubbed it "Palm Beach".

At this point, Pete Fleming had still not decided to participate in the operation, and Roger Youderian was still working in the jungle farther south. On December 23, the Flemings, Saints, Elliots and McCullys together made plans to land at Palm Beach and build a camp on January 3, 1956. They agreed to take weapons, but decided that they would only be used to fire into the air to scare the Huaorani if they attacked. They built a sort of <a href="tree%20house">tree house</a> that could be assembled upon arrival, and collected gifts, <a href="first%20aid">first aid</a> equipment, and language notes.

By January 2, Youderian had arrived and Fleming had confirmed his involvement, so the five met in <a href="Arajuno">Arajuno</a> to prepare to leave the following day. After minor mechanical trouble with the plane, Saint and McCully took off at 8:02 a.m. on January 3 and successfully landed on the sandy beach along the <a href="Curaray%20River">Curaray River</a>. Saint then flew Elliot and Youderian to the camp, and then made several more flights, carrying equipment. After the last delivery, he flew over a Huaorani settlement and, using a loudspeaker, told the Huaorani to visit the missionaries' camp. He then returned to <a href="Arajuno">Arajuno</a>, and the next day, he and Fleming flew out to Palm Beach.

On January 6, after the Americans had spent several days of waiting and shouting basic Huaorani phrases into the jungle, the first Huaorani visitors arrived. A young man and two women emerged on the opposite river bank around 11:15 a.m., and soon joined the missionaries at their encampment. The younger of the two women had come against the wishes of her family, and the man, named <a href="List%20of%20Huaorani%20people">Nankiwi</a>, who was romantically interested in her, followed. The older woman (about thirty years old) acted as a self-appointed chaperone. The men gave them several gifts, including a <a href="model%20aircraft">model plane</a>, and the visitors soon relaxed and began conversing freely, apparently not realizing that the men's language skills were weak. Nankiwi, whom the missionaries nicknamed "George", showed interest in their aircraft, so Saint took off with him aboard. They first completed a circuit around the camp, but Nankiwi appeared eager for a second trip, so they flew toward Terminal City. Upon reaching a familiar clearing, Nankiwi recognized his neighbors, and leaning out of the plane, wildly waved and shouted to them. Later that afternoon, the younger woman became restless, and though the missionaries offered their visitors sleeping quarters, Nankiwi and the young woman left the beach with little explanation. The older woman apparently had more interest in conversing with the missionaries, and remained there most of the night.

After seeing Nankiwi in the plane, a small group of Huaorani decided to make the trip to Palm Beach, and left the following morning, January 7. On the way, they encountered Nankiwi and the girl, returning unescorted. The girl's brother, <a href="Nampa%20%28Huaorani%29">Nampa</a>, was furious at this, and to defuse the situation and divert attention from himself, Nankiwi claimed that the foreigners had attacked them on the beach, and in their haste to flee, they had been separated from their chaperone. <a href="Gikita">Gikita</a>, a senior member of the group whose experience with outsiders had taught him that they could not be trusted, recommended that they kill the foreigners. The return of the older woman and her account of the friendliness of the missionaries was not enough to dissuade them, and they soon continued toward the beach.

On January 8 the missionaries waited, expecting a larger group of Huaorani to arrive sometime that afternoon, if only to get plane rides. Saint made several trips over Huaorani settlements, and on the following morning he noted a group of Huaorani men traveling toward Palm Beach. He excitedly relayed this information to his wife over the radio at 12:30 p.m., promising to make contact again at 4:30 p.m.

The Huaorani arrived at Palm Beach around 3:00 p.m., and in order to divide the foreigners before attacking them, they sent three women to the other side of the river. One, <a href="List%20of%20Huaorani%20people">Dawa</a>, remained hidden in the jungle, but the other two showed themselves. Two of the missionaries waded into the water to greet them, but were attacked from behind by <a href="List%20of%20Huaorani%20people">Nampa</a>. Apparently attempting to scare him, Elliot, the first missionary to be speared, drew his pistol and began firing. One of these shots mildly injured Dawa, still hidden, and another grazed the missionary's attacker after he was grabbed from behind by one of the women. Accounts differ on the effect of that bullet. Missionaries interpreted the testimonies of Dawa and Dayuma to mean that Nampa was killed months later while hunting, but others, including missionary anthropologist <a href="James%20Yost">James Yost</a>, came to believe that his death was a result of the bullet wound. Rachel Saint did not accept this, holding that eyewitnesses supported her position, but researcher Laura Rival, a critic of the expedition, suggests that it is now commonly believed among Huaorani that Nampa died of the wound. The other missionary in the river, Fleming, before being speared, desperately reiterated friendly overtures and asked the Huaorani why they were killing them. Meanwhile, the other Huaorani warriors, led by Gikita, attacked the three missionaries still on the beach, spearing Saint first, then McCully as he rushed to stop them. Youderian ran to the airplane to get to the radio, but he was speared as he picked up the microphone to report the attack. The Huaorani then threw the men's bodies and their belongings in the river, and ripped the fabric from their aircraft. They then returned to their village and, anticipating retribution, burned it to the ground and fled into the jungle.

At 4:30 p.m., Marj Saint and Pete Fleming's wife, Olive, were waiting for the call from Saint. Not receiving word at 4:30 p.m. immediately caused his wife Marj to worry, but Marj and Olive did not tell anyone about the lack of communication until that evening. (To avoid interference, the entire mission had been kept a secret from all those not directly involved at the time, thus making the timing of this announcement more difficult.) The next morning, January 9, Johnny Keenan flew to the camp site, and at 9:30 a.m. he reported via radio to the wives that the plane was stripped of its fabric, and that the men were not there. The <a href="Unified%20Combatant%20Command%23History">Commander in Chief of the Caribbean Command</a>, Lieutenant General William K. Harrison, was contacted, and <a href="Quito">Quito</a>-based radio station <a href="HCJB">HCJB</a> released a news bulletin saying that five men were missing in Huaorani territory. Soon, aircraft from the United States Air Rescue Service in <a href="Panama">Panama</a> were flying over the jungle, and a ground search party consisting of missionaries and military personnel was organized. The first two of the bodies were found on Wednesday, January 11, and on Thursday, Ed McCully's body was identified by a group of Quechuas. They took his watch as evidence of the finding but did not move his body from its location on the bank of the Curaray; it later washed away. Two more bodies were found on January 12. The searchers hoped that one of the unidentified bodies would be McCully, thinking that perhaps one of the men had escaped. However, on January 13, all four of the bodies found were positively identified by watches and wedding rings, and McCully's body was not among them, confirming that all five were dead. In the midst of a <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical storm</a>, they were buried in a common grave at Palm Beach on January 14 by members of the ground search party.

"<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" magazine covered the deaths of the men with a photo essay, including photographs by <a href="Cornell%20Capa">Cornell Capa</a> and some taken by the five men before their deaths. The ensuing worldwide publicity gave several missionary organizations significant more visibility, especially in the United States and <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>. Most notable among these was the <a href="SIL%20International">Summer Institute of Linguistics</a> (SIL), the organization for which both Elisabeth Elliot and Rachel Saint worked. Because of the martyrdom of her brother, Saint considered herself spiritually bonded to the Huaorani, believing that what she saw as his sacrifice for the Huaorani was symbolic of <a href="Christ">Christ</a>'s death for the salvation of humanity. In 1957, Saint and her Huaorani companion Dayuma toured across the United States and appeared on the television show "<a href="This%20Is%20Your%20Life">This Is Your Life</a>". The two also appeared in a <a href="Billy%20Graham">Billy Graham</a> crusade in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, contributing to Saint's increasing popularity among evangelical Christians and generating significant monetary donations for SIL.

Saint and Elliot returned to Ecuador to work among the Huaorani (1958-1960), establishing a camp called Tihueno near a former Huaorani settlement. Rachel Saint and Dayuma became bonded in Huaorani eyes through their shared mourning and Rachel's adoption as a sister of Dayuma, taking the name Nemo from the latter's deceased youngest sister. Nemo means star in Huaorani, they said she was their light. The first Huaorani to settle there were primarily women and children from a Huaorani group called the Guiquetairi, but in 1968 an enemy Huaorani band known as the Baihuari joined them. Elliot had returned to the United States in the early 1960s, so Saint and Dayuma worked to alleviate the resulting conflict. They succeeded in securing cohabitation of the two groups by overseeing numerous cross-band weddings, leading to an end of inter-clan warfare but obscuring the cultural identity of each group.

Saint and Dayuma, in conjunction with SIL, negotiated the creation of an official Huaorani reservation in 1969, consolidating the Huaorani and consequently opening up the area to commerce and <a href="oil%20exploration">oil exploration</a>. By 1973, over 500 people lived in Tihueno, of which more than half had arrived in the previous six years. The settlement relied on aid from SIL, and as a Christian community, followed rules foreign to Huaorani culture like prohibitions on killing and <a href="polygamy">polygamy</a>. By the early 1970s, SIL began to question whether their impact on the Huaorani was positive, so they sent James Yost, a staff <a href="anthropology">anthropologist</a>, to assess the situation. He found extensive economic dependence and increasing <a href="cultural%20assimilation">cultural assimilation</a>, and as a result, SIL ended its support of the settlement in 1976, leading to its disintegration and the dispersion of the Huaorani into the surrounding area. SIL had hoped that the Huaorani would return to the isolation in which they had lived twenty years prior, but instead they sought out contact with the outside world, forming villages of which many have been recognized by the Ecuadorian government.

Among evangelical Christians, the five men are commonly considered <a href="martyr">martyr</a>s and missionary heroes. Books have been written about them by numerous biographers, most notably <a href="Elisabeth%20Elliot">Elisabeth Elliot</a>. Anniversaries of their deaths have been accompanied by stories in major Christian publications, and their story, as well as the subsequent acceptance of Christianity among the Huaorani, has been turned into several motion pictures.

Even so, Christians have noted with concern the disintegration of traditional Huaorani culture and <a href="westernization">westernization</a> of the tribe, beginning with Nate Saint's own journal entry in 1955 and continuing through today. However, many continue to view as positive both Operation Auca and the subsequent missionary efforts of Rachel Saint, mission organizations such as <a href="Mission%20Aviation%20Fellowship">Mission Aviation Fellowship</a>, <a href="Wycliffe%20Bible%20Translators">Wycliffe Bible Translators</a>, <a href="HCJB">HCJB</a> World Radio, <a href="Avant%20Ministries">Avant Ministries</a> (formerly "Gospel Missionary Union"), and others. Specifically, they note the decline in violence among tribe members, numerous conversions to Christianity, and growth of the local church.

Anthropologists generally have less favorable views of the missionary work begun by Operation Auca, viewing the intervention as the cause for the recent and widely recognized decline of Huaorani culture. Leading Huaorani researcher Laura Rival says that the work of the SIL "pacified" the Huaorani during the 1960s, and argues that missionary intervention caused significant changes in fundamental components of Huaorani society. Prohibitions of polygamy, violence, chanting, and dancing were directly contrary to cultural norms, and the relocation of Huaorani and subsequent <a href="Exogamy">intermarrying</a> of previously hostile groups eroded <a href="cultural%20identity">cultural identity</a>. 

Others are somewhat less negative—Brysk, after noting that the work of the missionaries opened the area to outside intervention and led to the deterioration of the culture, says that the SIL also informed the Huaorani of their legal rights and taught them how to protect their interests from developers. Boster goes even further, suggesting that the "pacification" of the Huaorani was a result of "active effort" by the Huaorani themselves, not the result of missionary imposition. He argues that Christianity served as a way for the Huaorani to escape the cycle of violence in their community, since it provided a motivation to abstain from killing.

There have been several screen depictions of Operation Auca. The 2004 documentary "<a href="Beyond%20the%20Gates%20of%20Splendor">Beyond the Gates of Splendor</a>" featured interviews with some of the Huaorani and surviving family members of the missionaries. The 2006 drama film "<a href="End%20of%20the%20Spear">End of the Spear</a>" grossed over $12 million.

The creek flows south from the <a href="dissected%20plateau">dissected</a> <a href="Allegheny%20Plateau">Allegheny Plateau</a> to the <a href="Ridge-and-valley%20Appalachians">Ridge-and-valley Appalachians</a> through sandstone, limestone, and shale from the <a href="Devonian">Devonian</a>, <a href="Mississippian%20age">Mississippian</a>, and <a href="Pennsylvanian%20%28geology%29">Pennsylvanian</a> periods.

The valley's first recorded inhabitants were the <a href="Susquehannock">Susquehannock</a>s, followed by the <a href="Lenape">Lenape</a> and other tribes. The <a href="Great%20Shamokin%20Path">Great Shamokin Path</a> crossed the creek near its mouth, where Larry Burt, the first Euro-American settler and the man who gave the creek its present name, also lived by 1769. In the 19th century, the creek and its watershed were a center for logging and related industries, including 53 sawmills, <a href="gristmill">grist mills</a>, leather <a href="Tanning%20%28leather%29">tanneries</a>, coal and iron mines. A 1903 newspaper article claimed "No other stream in the country had so many mills in so small a territory". For transportation, a <a href="plank%20road">plank road</a> ran along much of the creek for decades, and two "<a href="paper%20railroad">paper railroad</a>s" were planned, but never built.

As of 2006, the Larrys Creek watershed is 83.1% forest and 15.7% agricultural (a reforestation of land <a href="Clearfelling">clear-cut</a> in the 19th century). Nearly of second-growth forest are <a href="protected%20area">protected</a> public and private land for <a href="hunting">hunting</a> and trout <a href="fishing">fishing</a>, with more land protected in parts of <a href="Tiadaghton%20State%20Forest">Tiadaghton State Forest</a>. Pollution from past industrial use is gone and Larrys Creek "has an exceptionally scenic, ultra-highwater, whitewater run" for <a href="canoeing">canoeing</a>. Despite agricultural <a href="surface%20runoff">runoff</a> and small amounts of <a href="acid%20mine%20drainage">acid mine drainage</a>, water quality is quite good, and a <a href="water%20supply">water filtration plant</a> on Larrys Creek supplies over 2500 customers.

Larrys Creek is named for Larry Burt, the first European settler in the area, who lived near the mouth of the creek outside what is now the <a href="hamlet%20%28place%29">hamlet</a> of Larrys Creek in <a href="Piatt%20Township%2C%20Pennsylvania">Piatt Township</a>. He traded with the <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">indigenous peoples</a>, and, according to a tradition reported by Meginness (1892), he had a <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> wife. Larry Burt was already there when surveyors came through in 1769 (after the land was purchased by the colonial government of Pennsylvania on November 5, 1768 as part of the "<a href="New%20Purchase%20%281768%29">New Purchase</a>" in the first <a href="Treaty%20of%20Fort%20Stanwix">Treaty of Fort Stanwix</a>), but disappeared sometime soon after, perhaps moving west with the Native Americans who left the area.

Larrys Creek is the only major creek in Lycoming County for which a Native American name is unknown. As of 2006, it is the only stream named "Larrys Creek" on <a href="USGS">USGS</a> maps of the United States and in the USGS <a href="Geographic%20Names%20Information%20System">Geographic Names Information System</a>. The possessive <a href="apostrophe">apostrophe</a> is not part of the official name of the creek, although records from the 19th century often spell it as "Larry's Creek" (as do today).

Today the creek has given its name to the hamlet at its mouth, as well as the village of "Larryville" further upstream. Before it became a borough, <a href="Salladasburg%2C%20Pennsylvania">Salladasburg</a> was also known as "Larrys Creek" (from the name of its post office). The "First Fork" and "Second Fork" of Larrys Creek are named in the order in which they are encountered traveling upstream, with "Fork" here denoting a major tributary. "Lawshe Run", the major tributary of the Second Fork, is named for Robert Lawshe, who established a tannery in Salladasburg in 1848. "Seeley Run", a minor tributary entering the creek at Larryville, is named for Mr. Seely, who built the first sawmill on Larrys Creek in 1796. While the USGS uses "Seeley Run", it is still "Seely Run Road" that follows the stream. The First Fork, Canoe Run, Joes Run, and Wolf Run also have roads named for them.

Larrys Creek is the only major watershed in Lycoming County entirely within the county. Measured directly, Lycoming County is about northwest of <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> and east-northeast of <a href="Pittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania">Pittsburgh</a>. It is from the mouth of Larrys Creek along the West Branch Susquehanna River to its confluence with the <a href="Susquehanna%20River">Susquehanna River</a> at <a href="Northumberland%2C%20Pennsylvania">Northumberland, Pennsylvania</a>. The <a href="source%20%28river%20or%20stream%29">source</a> of Larrys Creek is in northern Lycoming County in <a href="Cogan%20House%20Township%2C%20Pennsylvania">Cogan House Township</a>, just south of the hamlet of Steam Valley, at an elevation of It flows west-southwest through the village of Cogan House, and then under the <a href="Cogan%20House%20Covered%20Bridge">Cogan House Covered Bridge</a>.

The creek next heads due south through <a href="Pennsylvania%20State%20Game%20Lands">Pennsylvania State Game Lands</a> Number 114. There it runs for about with only a trail or unimproved road beside it. It passes through <a href="Mifflin%20Township%2C%20Lycoming%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Mifflin Township</a> for a short distance and heads southeast into <a href="Anthony%20Township%2C%20Lycoming%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Anthony Township</a>, where it leaves the State Game Lands and passes a water filtration plant; there is a dam tall and wide here. Further south, it receives Roaring Run (on the <a href="wikt%3Aleft%20bank">left bank</a>). Roaring Run receives the only acid mine drainage in the watershed and enters Larrys Creek from the mouth.

Larrys Creek then heads southwest back into Mifflin Township, where it passes through the borough of <a href="Salladasburg%2C%20Pennsylvania">Salladasburg</a>, with <a href="Pennsylvania%20Route%20973">Pennsylvania Route 973</a> running parallel to the creek from the township line to the borough. At Salladasburg, Larrys Creek receives its major tributary, the Second Fork of Larrys Creek, on the <a href="wikt%3Aright%20bank">right bank</a> from the mouth.

The Second Fork rises in Cogan House Township near the village of White Pine and runs south through the village of Brookside, then a few miles through <a href="Cummings%20Township%2C%20Pennsylvania">Cummings Township</a>, and last through Mifflin Township and Salladasburg. Lawshe Run is its major tributary. <a href="Pennsylvania%20Route%20287">Pennsylvania Route 287</a> runs parallel to the Second Fork its whole length, and continues parallel to Larrys Creek from Salladasburg south to its terminus on <a href="U.S.%20Route%20220">U.S. Route 220</a> (near the creek's mouth).

Just south of Salladasburg, Larrys Creek receives the First Fork of Larrys Creek, from the mouth. The First Fork has its source in Cummings Township and flows south-southeast into Mifflin Township. from its mouth Larrys Creek receives Canoe Run. Both these tributaries enter on the right bank.

Larrys Creek then enters Piatt Township, flowing east around a ridge and through the village of Larryville where it receives Seeley Run on the left bank, from the mouth. It next flows back southwest, then south to the hamlet of Larrys Creek and finally into the West Branch Susquehanna River, east of the borough of <a href="Jersey%20Shore%2C%20Pennsylvania">Jersey Shore</a>, at an elevation of . U.S. Route 220 and the <a href="Lycoming%20Valley%20Railroad">Lycoming Valley Railroad</a> cross the creek on separate bridges just north of its mouth. The direct distance between the source and mouth is only . The difference in elevation between source and mouth, , divided by the length of the creek, , gives the average drop in elevation per unit length of creek or <a href="relief%20ratio">relief ratio</a> of 53.5 feet per mile (10.1 m/km). The <a href="meander">meander ratio</a> is 1.08, so the creek is fairly straight in its bed.

From 1960 to 1979, the <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a> (USGS) operated one <a href="stream%20gauge">stream gauge</a> on Larrys Creek at the village of Cogan House, for the uppermost of the watershed. The mean <a href="discharge%20%28hydrology%29">discharge</a> measured at this site from 1961 to 1978 was 10.8 cubic feet per second (0.306 m³/s), with a peak discharge of 1,130 cubic feet per second (32.0 m³/s) and peak gauge height of , both on June 22, 1972 during <a href="Hurricane%20Agnes">Hurricane Agnes</a>. The USGS also estimated mean monthly and annual <a href="groundwater%20recharge">groundwater recharge</a> at the Cogan House stream gauge. Using data from 1961 to 1977, the upper and lower annual recharge estimates were , and the greatest monthly recharge was in March, with 20.1% of the annual total.

The USGS also measured discharge at the village of Larrys Creek, very near the creek's mouth, as part of water quality measurements on seven occasions between 1970 and 1975. The average discharge was 66.0 cubic feet per second (1.87 m/s), and ranged from a high of 114 cubic feet per second (3.23 m/s) to a low of 8.8 cubic feet per second (0.25 m/s). Lycoming County operates a stream gauge at Salladasburg as part of the county-wide flood warning system. It only measures the water height (not discharge) and had a peak gauge height of , on September 18, 2004 during <a href="Hurricane%20Ivan">Hurricane Ivan</a>.

Larrys Creek is in a <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>, <a href="limestone">limestone</a>, and <a href="shale">shale</a> mountain region, with the source in the dissected Allegheny Plateau and the mouth in the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians. The southern part of the Larrys Creek watershed has <a href="sedimentary">sedimentary</a> surface rocks from the Devonian period, with a large area from the Mississippian period in the north of the watershed and a small Pennsylvanian period region within this area. The Cogan House <a href="anticline">anticline</a> runs north of and parallel to the upper part of the creek. Iron ore within the watershed was mined south of Salladasburg and along Canoe Run in the 19th century; there are also deposits on Puterbaugh Mountain.

Larrys Creek is in a narrow valley formed by mountains and hills, with steep to moderate slopes. The <a href="stream%20bed">channel</a> pattern is regular, with a dendritic drainage pattern. South of its source, the creek turns to flow southwest along the northern edge of Green Mountain, turns south into the State Game Lands at Buckhorn Mountain, and flows south along the western edge of Coal Mountain. The only named peak on the west bank of Larrys Creek itself is Harris Point, where it leaves the dissected Allegheny Plateau.

The Second Fork flows south along the eastern side of Henson Ridge, then east of Puterbaugh Mountain. The only named peak on the east bank of the Second Fork is Clapp Point, which marks the boundary of the dissected plateau and is southwest of Harris Point. The First Fork flows past the southwest edge of Little Round Top and then continues on the southwest side of Puterbaugh Mountain. Fishery Point is at the southern end of the Allegheny Plateau, just west of the First Fork. The three features named Point are each part of the <a href="Allegheny%20Front">Allegheny Front</a>, the edge of the Allegheny Plateau.

The Larrys Creek watershed has two deposits of low volatile <a href="bituminous">bituminous</a> coal along Roaring Run and a small, deep <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a> field. A potentially large source of natural gas is the <a href="Marcellus%20Shale">Marcellus Shale</a>, which lies below the surface here and stretches from <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> through Pennsylvania to <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> and <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a>. Estimates of the total natural gas in the black shale from the Devonian era range from 168 to 516 trillion cubic feet (4.76 to 14.6 trillion m), with at least 10 percent considered recoverable. In November 2007, drilling within the Larrys Creek watershed started in Mifflin Township, just west of Salladasburg, with a deep well. A second well was drilled in Mifflin Township in December 2007, and by February 2008 every well drilled in Lycoming County was producing natural gas. The Marcellus Shale requires special techniques to fracture the rock and release the gas, including pumping sand and water into the well, and, in some cases, horizontal drilling.

The Larrys Creek watershed is entirely in Lycoming County and accounts for 7.17% of the county by area. It is the only major creek whose watershed is entirely in the county, and lies between the <a href="Pine%20Creek%20%28Pennsylvania%29">Pine Creek</a> watershed (including <a href="Little%20Pine%20Creek">Little Pine Creek</a>) to the west and the <a href="Lycoming%20Creek">Lycoming Creek</a> watershed to the east (as measured on the river).

The Larrys Creek watershed has a total population of 2,513 (as of 2000) and a total area of . Of that area, are forested and are given to agricultural uses. Larrys Creek is the largest creek in Lycoming County without its own watershed association.

The major smaller streams in the Larrys Creek watershed include the First and Second Forks, Roaring Run, Lawshe Run, and Canoe Run. The Second Fork is the largest tributary, with a watershed of or 28.0% of the total watershed. The First Fork is next largest, with a watershed of or 19.8% of the total. Roaring Run accounts for 5.7% of the total watershed with and other tributaries are less than 5% of the total.

Starting at the mouth, the tributaries of Larrys Creek are: Seeley Run, Canoe Run, First Fork Larrys Creek, Second Fork Larrys Creek, Mash Run, "Pond Hollow", "Spook Hollow", Roaring Run, "Cramer Hollow", "Pot Lick Hollow", "Match Pine Hollow", "Watt Hollow", Long Run, Wendell Run, Crayton Hollow Run, Wolf Run, Dibber Hollow Run, and Birch Run (unnamed streams in a named feature are given as the name of the feature in quotation marks).

The <a href="clearfelling">clear-cutting</a> of forests in the 19th century adversely affected the ecology of the Larrys Creek watershed and its water quality. Polluting industries on the creek and its tributaries during that period included coal and iron mines and tanneries. As of 2006, water quality in Larrys Creek is quite good, although two small unnamed tributaries of Roaring Run do receive acid mine drainage from an abandoned <a href="coal%20mine">coal mine</a>. Agricultural runoff is another source of pollution. Effluent limits for Larrys Creek in Mifflin Township for the 5-day test for carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD) are 25 mg/L, while <a href="fecal%20coliform%20bacteria">fecal coliform bacteria</a> count limits are 200 per 100 mL in May through September, and 2000 per 100 mL in October through April.

The mean annual <a href="Precipitation%20%28meteorology%29">precipitation</a> for Larrys Creek is . According to the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Fish%20and%20Boat%20Commission">Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission</a>: "Pennsylvania receives the most <a href="acid%20rain">acid deposition</a> of any state in the nation because, in addition to being the third highest producer of the gases that cause acid deposition, we are also located downwind from the highest concentration of air pollution emitters." The region's geology gives it a relatively low capacity to <a href="Neutralization%20%28chemistry%29">neutralize</a> added acid. This makes the creek especially vulnerable to increased acidification from rain, which poses a threat to the long term health of the plants and animals in the creek.

The <a href="Jersey%20Shore%2C%20Pennsylvania">Jersey Shore</a> Area Joint Water Authority’s water filtration plant is on Larrys Creek, near the border between Mifflin and Anthony Townships. The plant has been there since at least 1914 and provides water from the creek to 2,500 industrial and residential customers in the boroughs of Jersey Shore and Salladasburg, as well as Anthony, Mifflin, <a href="Nippenose%20Township%2C%20Lycoming%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Nippenose</a>, Piatt, and <a href="Porter%20Township%2C%20Lycoming%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Porter Townships</a> in southwestern Lycoming County, and <a href="Pine%20Creek%20Township%2C%20Clinton%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Pine Creek Township</a> in the southeastern part of neighboring <a href="Clinton%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Clinton County, Pennsylvania</a>.

There are at least two camps along Larrys Creek. "Camp <a href="Kiwanis">Kiwanis</a>" has a main lodge, four cabins, picnic pavilion, and various recreational facilities on on Route 287, south of Salladasburg in Mifflin Township. It is operated as a service by the <a href="Williamsport%2C%20Pennsylvania">Williamsport</a> Kiwanis and rented out for fire department training, Girl Scouts, weddings, church, and other groups. Further south along the creek in Piatt Township is the <a href="New%20Tribes%20Mission">New Tribes Mission</a> camp for preparing <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> <a href="missionary">missionaries</a> for field work with <a href="indigenous%20peoples">indigenous peoples</a> in remote parts of the world. The training at the camp lasts one year.

Edward Gertler writes in "Keystone Canoeing" that Larrys Creek "has an exceptionally scenic, ultra-highwater, whitewater run that is really worthy of your attention". Canoeing and <a href="kayak">kayak</a>ing on Larrys Creek are possible when the water is high enough (in Spring and after hard rain), with of Class 3 <a href="whitewater">whitewater</a> on the <a href="International%20Scale%20of%20River%20Difficulty">International Scale of River Difficulty</a> from Township Road 786 south through the State Game Lands to Route 973, and of Class 1 to 2 whitewater south from PA 973 to U.S. 220.

In addition to the in State Game Lands No. 114, opportunities for hunting and fishing are available in the areas of Tiadaghton State Forest in the western part of the watershed, along the First and Second Forks. In 2002, a <a href="Pennsylvania%20Department%20of%20Conservation%20and%20Natural%20Resources">Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources</a> (DCNR) report on "State Forest Waters with Special Protection" rated the First Fork as a "High Quality-Cold Water Fishery". A stretch of Larrys Creek from the water company filtration plant (near the border between Mifflin and Anthony Townships) to downstream of the confluence with the First Fork has been designated as approved <a href="trout">trout</a> waters by the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Fish%20and%20Boat%20Commission">Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission</a>. This means the waters will be stocked with trout and may be fished during trout season.

There are also private hunting and fishing clubs and cabins along Larrys Creek and its tributaries. The largest is the "Larrys Creek Fish and Game Club", incorporated August 1, 1906, which owns over along Route 287 on the Second Fork. As of 2006, the club has 55 active and 15 honorary members (all male). The club promotes conservation and stocks its of trout stream with three to four thousand brook and brown trout each year. The club's facilities include a <a href="trapshooting">trapshooting</a> range and a <a href="helipad">helipad</a>, to aid in medical evacuations from its remote location.

Another large private club is the Ogontz Lodge on the First Fork, established by banker <a href="Jay%20Cooke">Jay Cooke</a> about 1884 for fishing and hunting. Cooke owned nearly the whole First Fork, long, with the main "Lodge" from the mouth, and a smaller "Upper Cabin" upstream of that. <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a> found solitude at the Ogontz Lodge as a guest of Jay Cooke III three times: in June, 1918 (just before leaving for Europe as head of the American Food Administration), mid-May, 1928 (just before his selection as the Republican presidential candidate), and finally in late May, 1930 (as <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a>). Other notable guests at the Ogontz Lodge include <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt%2C%20Jr.">Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.</a> and <a href="Katharine%20Hepburn">Katharine Hepburn</a>, and it is still in operation as of 2007.

Two <a href="Clovis%20point">Clovis point</a>s found in the Salladasburg area in a "stream site" are the earliest evidence of human activity along Larrys Creek ("circa" 10,000 <a href="Common%20Era">BCE</a>). The earliest recorded inhabitants of the Susquehanna River valley were the <a href="Iroquoian%20languages">Iroquoian</a> speaking <a href="Susquehannock">Susquehannock</a>s. Their name meant "people of the muddy river" in <a href="Algonquian%20languages">Algonquian</a>. <a href="Decimation%20%28Roman%20army%29%23Current%20usage%20of%20the%20word">Decimated</a> by diseases and warfare, they had died out, moved away, or been <a href="cultural%20assimilation">assimilated</a> into other tribes by the early 18th century. The lands of the <a href="West%20Branch%20Susquehanna%20River%20Valley">West Branch Susquehanna River Valley</a> were then chiefly occupied by the <a href="Munsee">Munsee</a> <a href="phratry">phratry</a> of the <a href="Lenape">Lenape</a> (or Delaware), and were under the nominal control of the Five (later Six) Nations of the <a href="Iroquois">Iroquois</a>. The Great Shamokin Path crossed the creek at a <a href="Ford%20%28crossing%29">ford</a> near its mouth; however, no trails of the indigenous peoples are recorded as having followed Larrys Creek north.

On November 5, 1768, the <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> acquired the "New Purchase" from the Iroquois in the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Fort%20Stanwix">Treaty of Fort Stanwix</a>, opening what is now Lycoming County to settlement. However, the <a href="Line%20of%20Property">Line of Property</a> (or <a href="Purchase%20Line">Purchase Line</a>) border defined by "Tiadaghton Creek" dividing colonial and Native American lands was disputed. The colonists claimed this was Pine Creek, the Iroquois and other tribes that it was Lycoming Creek. Larrys Creek was in the disputed territory between these, so the illegal settlers there were part of the "<a href="Fair%20Play%20Men">Fair Play Men</a>" system of self-government, with their own Declaration of Independence from Britain on July 4, 1776.

In the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">Revolutionary War</a>, settlements throughout the Susquehanna valley were attacked by <a href="Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Loyalists</a> and Native Americans allied with the British. After the <a href="Battle%20of%20Wyoming">Wyoming Valley battle and massacre</a> in the summer of 1778 (near what is now <a href="Wilkes-Barre%2C%20Pennsylvania">Wilkes-Barre</a>) and smaller local attacks, the "<a href="The%20Big%20Runaway">Big Runaway</a>" occurred throughout the West Branch Susquehanna valley. Settlers fled feared and actual attacks by the British and their allies. Homes and fields were abandoned, with livestock driven along and a few possessions floated on rafts on the river east to <a href="Muncy%2C%20Pennsylvania">Muncy</a>, then further south to <a href="Sunbury%2C%20Pennsylvania">Sunbury</a>. The abandoned property was burnt by the attackers. Some settlers soon returned, only to flee again in the summer of 1779 in the "Little Runaway". <a href="Sullivan%27s%20Expedition">Sullivan's Expedition</a> helped stabilize the area and encouraged resettlement, which continued after the war.

On April 13, 1795, Lycoming County was formed from <a href="Northumberland%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Northumberland County</a>, prompting further growth. In 1800, the "State Road" was the second major road built in the county and followed part of Larrys Creek in Cogan House Township as it ran from Newberry (the western part of Williamsport today) north to the Pennsylvania-<a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> state line near <a href="Painted%20Post%2C%20New%20York">Painted Post, New York</a>. Larrys Creek had a bridge near the mouth by 1806, the first of the major creeks in the county for which a bridge is mentioned.

Like all creeks in Lycoming County, Larrys Creek served as an area for settlers to establish <a href="Homestead%20%28buildings%29">homesteads</a> and farms. As logging became a major industry in the mid-19th century, the creek was a source of power for <a href="sawmill">sawmill</a>s and other mills. The first sawmill on the creek, in what is now Mifflin Township, was built in 1799. The relatively low flow of water in the creek did not allow rafts of logs to be floated downstream to the river and the lumber boom at Williamsport (as they were on Pine Creek to the west).

This and the lack of logging railroads along the creek led to the development of many small sawmills: the Larrys Creek watershed once had 53 sawmills within of the mouth (as well as other industries of the time). No other stream in the country had so many sawmills in so small a territory. Twelve sawmills were on the Second Fork, six on the First Fork, one each on Canoe Run and Lawshe Run, and the rest were on Larrys Creek itself. Eight were structures rebuilt on the site of previous sawmills, and only four were <a href="steam%20power">steam power</a>ed (the rest were <a href="water%20power">water power</a>ed). The earliest of these sawmills was built in 1796 (near Seeley Run), the last in 1902 (on Lawshe Run), and by 1903 just two mills were still standing and only one of those was operating.

Lumbering removed the tree trunks, but left many flammable limbs, branches, and stumps behind. On May 2, 1872, a large <a href="forest%20fire">forest fire</a> destroyed the villages of Carter and Gould, north of Salladasburg on Larrys Creek in Mifflin Township. There are large tracts of second growth forest and small lumber companies still operate in the watershed today.

Two "paper railroads" were proposed for Larrys Creek: the "Larry's Creek Railroad and Coal Company", incorporated June 24, 1839 to hold and operate up to of railroad from the mouth of the creek north to the coal mines; and the "Jersey Shore, Pine Creek & State Line Railroad", incorporated on April 11, 1853 to run north from Jersey Shore up Pine Creek to <a href="Tioga%2C%20Pennsylvania">Tioga</a> or Long Run, and thence to the <a href="New%20York-Pennsylvania%20border">New York state line</a>. Its charter was amended April 4, 1854 to run up <a href="Marsh%20Creek%20%28Pine%20Creek%29">Marsh Creek</a> (then known as the Third Fork Pine Creek) and <a href="Crooked%20Creek%20%28Pennsylvania%29">Crooked Creek</a> to the <a href="Tioga%20Railroad">Tioga Railroad</a>, and again on March 26, 1856 to run up Little Pine Creek (then known as First Fork Pine Creek) to the Larrys Creek Plank Road and then up Blockhouse Creek to <a href="Blossburg%2C%20Pennsylvania">Blossburg</a>. It was still an active corporation in 1865, but the charter of the "<a href="Jersey%20Shore%2C%20Pine%20Creek%20and%20Buffalo%20Railway">Jersey Shore, Pine Creek and Buffalo Railway</a>" in 1870 (New York City-Reading interests) superseded it. Neither railroad was actually ever built. The only railroad in the watershed crosses the creek just north of the mouth.

In 1851 a <a href="plank%20road">plank road</a> or puncheon was built along Larrys Creek from the village of Larrys Creek at the creek's mouth north to Salladasburg, then later along the Second Fork and on to the village of Brookside in Cogan House Township. It was later extended north to the village of White Pine and finally to the village of English Center in <a href="Pine%20Township%2C%20Lycoming%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Pine Township</a> (along the current course of <a href="Pennsylvania%20Route%20287">Pennsylvania Route 287</a>). A spur of the plank road along Larrys Creek into Anthony Township was also built, but it is not known how far it extended. (Landis claims it may have run nearly as far north as the covered bridge in Cogan House Township).
The plank road was a <a href="toll%20road">toll road</a> run by "The Larrys Creek Plank Road Company", a corporation founded May 8, 1850. It served the sawmills, grist mills, mines, and leather tanneries along the creek. There was a connection to the railroad and the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Canal%20%28West%20Branch%20Division%29">West Branch Division of the Pennsylvania Canal</a> at the hamlet of Larrys Creek, as well as the West Branch Susquehanna River.

<a href="Tsuga">Hemlock</a> logs were used to build the plank road. At that time, the <a href="tanbark">tree's bark</a> was a major source of <a href="tannin">tannin</a> used to <a href="Tanning%20%28leather%29">tan</a> leather. The wood was not used much for lumber, so hundreds of thousands of stripped hemlock logs were normally left to rot. There were sawmills and experienced lumber workers available from the local timber industry.

The earth under the plank road was first graded, then ties (similar to those used for railroad tracks) were set into the ground. Next long narrow stringers (similar to rails on a railroad track) were nailed to the ties, with a distance between stringers of about . The road surface consisted of planks about wide nailed to the stringers and was fairly smooth. The road had turnoffs (as it was not wide enough for horse-drawn vehicles to pass each other). <a href="Toll%20house">Toll house</a>s were at regular intervals, with variable tolls for pedestrians, riders on horseback and various carts and wagons. No toll schedule has survived.

The plank road was operational for about 38 years when a major flood on June 1, 1889 washed out much of it. The flood also destroyed the canal at the creek's mouth. The same storm system caused the <a href="Johnstown%20Flood">Johnstown Flood</a>, which killed over 2200 people. The Cogan House Covered Bridge was the only one on Larrys Creek to survive the flood, as a fallen tree formed a protective dam just upstream. The 90 foot (27 m) long <a href="Burr%20truss">Burr arch truss</a> bridge was built in 1877, listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1980, rehabilitated in 1998, and is today one of just three left in the county.
By then most of the original forests in the county had been clear-cut, so no cheap source of wood was available as before. While the road from Salladasburg south to the West Branch Susquehanna River was repaired and rebuilt, the rest was not. In 1900 the county courts recognized a <a href="petition">petition</a> to end tolls on this last portion of the road. The corporation was dissolved and the road and its maintenance passed to the county. As sections of plank road wore out they were replaced by <a href="dirt%20road">graded dirt</a> and <a href="gravel%20road">gravel</a>, so that it soon became a regular road. The plank road operated as a toll road for about 49 years. Today only the "Plank Road" name survives, in a section of road that runs north from <a href="U.S.%20Route%20220%20%28Pennsylvania%29">U.S. Route 220</a>, parallel to Route 287.

North Road (Manchester)

North Road was a <a href="association%20football">football</a> and <a href="cricket">cricket</a> ground in <a href="Newton%20Heath">Newton Heath</a>, Manchester, England. It was the first home of <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United Football Club</a> – then known as Newton Heath Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway Football Club – from its foundation in 1878 until 1893, when the club moved to a new ground at <a href="Bank%20Street%20%28football%20ground%29">Bank Street</a>, <a href="Clayton%20%28Manchester%29">Clayton</a>.

Initially the ground consisted only of the pitch, around which an estimated 12,000 spectators could congregate. The addition of <a href="grandstand">stands</a> in 1891 increased the capacity to about 15,000. The football club signed its first professional players in 1886 and began to break from its sponsoring railway company, but without the company's financial support it was unable to afford the rent on the ground and was evicted.

Following the foundation of Newton Heath LYR F.C., at the request of the employees of the <a href="Lancashire%20and%20Yorkshire%20Railway">Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway</a> (LYR) company's Carriage and Wagon Works, the club needed a pitch to play on. The chosen site was owned by the <a href="Manchester%20Cathedral">Manchester Cathedral</a> authorities, but although conveniently sited next to the wagon works it was a "bumpy, stony patch in summer, [and] a muddy, heavy swamp in the rainy months". The railway company agreed to pay a nominal rent to the authorities and to lease the ground to the football club. As it was next to the railway line operated by the LYR, the ground was often clouded in a thick mist of steam from passing trains. Players had to get changed in The Three Crowns <a href="public%20house">public house</a>, a few hundred yards away on Oldham Road, as there were no facilities nearby. There may have been some kind of refreshment offered to supporters at the eastern end of the site.

The first recorded matches at the ground took place in 1880, two years after the club's formation, most of them <a href="Exhibition%20game">friendlies</a>. The first competitive match held at North Road was a <a href="Lancashire%20Senior%20Cup">Lancashire Cup</a> first round match against <a href="Blackburn%20Olympic%20F.C.">Blackburn Olympic</a>'s <a href="reserve%20team">reserve team</a>, played on 27 October 1883, which Newton Heath lost 7–2. Details of the attendance have been lost, but it is assumed that the ground must have been enclosed by then, as an entry fee of 3<a href="Penny%20%28British%20pre-decimal%20coin%29">d</a> (about £ as of 2019) was charged for the match. Football became a professional sport in England in 1885, and Newton Heath signed their first professional players in the summer of 1886. The club's income was insufficient to cover its wage bill, and so the 3d admission charge was extended to all matches played at North Road, later rising to 6d.

The ground originally had a capacity of about 12,000, but club officials decided that was not enough to give them any hope of joining <a href="the%20Football%20League">the Football League</a>. Some expansion took place in 1887, but in 1891 Newton Heath used what little financial reserves they had to purchase two grandstands, each able to hold 1,000 spectators. However, this transaction put the club at odds with the railway company, who refused to contribute any finance to the deal. The two organisations began to drift apart from then onwards, and in 1892 the club attempted to raise £2,000 in share capital to pay off the debts incurred by the expansion of the ground. The split also led the railway company to stop paying the rent due on the ground to the cathedral, who at about the same time decided to increase the rent. Under increasing financial pressure, especially as the cathedral authorities felt it inappropriate for the club to charge admission to the ground, an eviction notice was served on the club in June 1893. The club's management had been searching for a new stadium since the first eviction attempt in May the previous year, and they were able to move to a new ground on <a href="Bank%20Street%20%28football%20ground%29">Bank Street</a>, three miles away in <a href="Clayton%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Clayton</a>. It proved impossible though to take the two grandstands to the new ground, and they were sold for £100.

The stadium no longer exists, and North Road has been renamed Northampton Road. After a spell serving as playing fields for locals, <a href="Moston%20Brook%20High%20School">Moston Brook High School</a> was opened on the site. A red plaque was attached to one of the school's walls, marking the location of the old stadium, but it was stolen and not replaced. Following the school's closure in August 2000, the site was chosen by the <a href="Northwest%20Regional%20Development%20Agency">Northwest Regional Development Agency</a> (NWDA) as the location of the <a href="North%20Manchester%20Business%20Park">North Manchester Business Park</a> in 2002.

Newton Heath LYR Football Club was also founded as a cricket club, and the North Road ground was used by both branches of the club. However, the cricket and football seasons often overlapped, causing conflicts between the two sports. The ground was barely adequate for football, despite the best efforts of groundsmen Charlie and Ned Massey, but its use in the winter made it even less suitable for cricket in the summer.

Although attendance figures were not recorded for many of the earliest matches at North Road, the highest recorded attendance at the ground was approximately 15,000 for a <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> match against <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a> on 4 March 1893. A similar attendance was also recorded for a friendly match against Gorton Villa on 5 September 1889. A record-low league attendance of approximately 1,000 was recorded for <a href="Football%20Alliance">Football Alliance</a> matches against <a href="Walsall%20F.C.">Walsall Town Swifts</a> and <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a> on 21 April 1890 and 13 December 1890 respectively. However, an attendance of 400 was recorded for a <a href="Manchester%20Senior%20Cup">Manchester Cup</a> match against Eccles on 31 January 1885.

The earliest recorded four-figure attendance at the ground was 3,000 for a friendly with West Gorton (St. Mark's) on 12 November 1881. This was the first recorded meeting of the two sides that eventually became <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> and <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>.

Herbie Hewett

Herbert Tremenheere "Herbie" Hewett (25 May 1864 – 4 March 1921) was an English <a href="History%20of%20English%20amateur%20cricket">amateur</a> <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a>er who played for <a href="Somerset%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Somerset</a>, <a href="Captain%20%28cricket%29">captaining</a> the county from 1889 to 1893, as well as <a href="Oxford%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Oxford University</a> and the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a>. A battling left-handed <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Opening%20batsman">opening batsman</a>, Hewett could post a large score in a short time against even the best bowlers. Capable of hitting the ball powerfully, he combined an excellent eye with an unorthodox style to be regarded at his peak as one of England's finest batsmen.

Hewett was educated at <a href="Harrow%20School">Harrow School</a>, won a <a href="Blue%20%28university%20sport%29">Blue</a> at <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford</a> in 1886 and played for Somerset from 1884. As an inconsistent middle-order batsman he made little impact during this period. Even so, he was appointed captain of Somerset in 1889. Over the next two years, his leadership and performances as an opening batsman were instrumental in the county regaining first-class status and admission to the <a href="County%20Championship">County Championship</a> in 1891. He remained Somerset captain for a further three seasons, usually opening the batting with <a href="Lionel%20Palairet">Lionel Palairet</a>. In 1892, <a href="Partnership%20%28cricket%29">they shared a partnership</a> of 346 for the first wicket, of which Hewett scored 201. The stand remains the county's highest first-wicket partnership. In that season, Hewett made 1,405 runs at an <a href="Batting%20average%23Cricket">average</a> of more than 35, and was named as one of the "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">Five Batsmen of the Year</a>" by "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden</a>". <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England</a> did not play any <a href="Test%20cricket">Test matches</a> at home in 1892, or else Hewett would probably have won a Test <a href="Cap%20%28sport%29">cap</a>; instead his highest accolade was being selected to play for the <a href="Gentlemen%20v%20Players">Gentlemen against the Players</a> at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a> in 1894. A disagreement over whether play should take place on a sodden pitch in the match against the <a href="Australia%20national%20cricket%20team">Australians</a> in 1893 led to Hewett's departure from Somerset at the end of that season.

He played first-class cricket for three more years, during which time he scored centuries against both Oxford and <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Cambridge Universities</a>, appearing for a variety of amateur and representative sides. Having been selected to captain an "England XI" at <a href="Scarborough%2C%20North%20Yorkshire">Scarborough</a> in 1895, Hewett was involved in another incident caused by a wet pitch. Feeling insulted by shouts of derision from the crowd, he left the match at lunch-time on the first day. He made only one further first-class appearance: playing for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Oxford University in 1896. Hewett practised as a <a href="barrister">barrister</a>, having been <a href="Call%20to%20the%20Bar">called to the Bar</a> at the <a href="Inner%20Temple">Inner Temple</a>.

Herbert Tremenheere Hewett was born at Norton Court in <a href="Norton%20Fitzwarren">Norton Fitzwarren</a>, near <a href="Taunton">Taunton</a> on 25 May 1864, the only son of William Henry and Frances M Hewett. Although he was the couple's only son, they had at least four daughters; in 1871 two older sisters, Emily Louisa and Helen G are listed in the census, along with one younger sister, Florance Ethel. By 1891, Mary W is also listed as a younger sister, although by this date both older sisters are no longer registered at the address nor their father William Henry. He was initially educated at Hillside, Godalming where he was captain of the cricket and <a href="rugby%20union">rugby</a> teams. On leaving Hillside in 1879 he went to <a href="Harrow%20School">Harrow School</a>. In 1881 he had a trial for the school cricket eleven mainly on the strength of his bowling, having taken all ten wickets for 22 runs in a <a href="House%20system">house</a> match. Hewett was part of the school's cricket first eleven in 1882 and 1883, and appeared in the <a href="Eton%20v%20Harrow">annual contest</a> against <a href="Eton%20College">Eton College</a> in both years, but did little on either occasion, his highest score being six, made in the first-innings in 1882. In all matches for Harrow he had a batting average of just 7.4 in 1883 and 9.5 in 1884 while his bowling average in 1884 was 32.10. Hewett also appeared in the school association football eleven in 1883. On completion of his studies at Harrow, he attended <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Oxford">Trinity College, Oxford</a>. In his reminiscences, <a href="W.%20G.%20Grace">W. G. Grace</a> suggests that Hewett "first won some little renown in Public School and 'Varsity cricket, but it was not until he joined Somersetshire that he forced himself to a prominent place in County Cricket."

After appearing in The Freshman's Match in 1884, during which he scored zero and eight and took two wickets, Hewett made little impact in his first season at Oxford and was not selected for the University eleven. His debut in first-class cricket came later that season for <a href="Somerset%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Somerset County Cricket Club</a> at Tunbridge Wells, when he was 20 years old. Against <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent</a> in late August, he scored 14 and 0 batting as part of the <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">middle order</a>, and claimed his only two <a href="Wicket%23Dismissing%20a%20batsman">wickets</a> in first-class cricket. He made one other appearance in 1884, against Lancashire.

In 1885 Hewett played in a trial match at Oxford without success. He did, however, play in four of Somerset's six first-class matches that summer. In his first game of the season for Somerset, in mid-July, Hewett scored his maiden <a href="Century%23Half-century">half-century</a>; he remained 50 <a href="not%20out">not out</a> in the second-innings of a five-wicket victory over <a href="Hampshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Hampshire</a>. He passed 50 for Somerset on two more occasions during 1885, and finished the season with 247 runs at a <a href="Batting%20average%23Cricket">batting average</a> of 35.28, one of seven seasons in which his average was in excess of 30.
He started the 1886 season well, scoring 151 for his college and 164 not out for Perambulators against Etceteras. An 1893 write-up in "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a>" said: "early in the season of 1886 <nowiki>[Hewett]</nowiki> showed signs of the brilliant hitting which has since made him famous". Although he top-scored in the Seniors Match, he was not selected for the eleven until the university's third game. He made scores of 49 and 77 in successive matches for <a href="Oxford%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Oxford University</a> against <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a> and gained his <a href="Blue%20%28university%20sport%29">Blue</a>, scoring 0 and 7 in the <a href="The%20University%20Match%20%28cricket%29">University Match</a> against <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Cambridge</a>. He finished the season fourth in the Oxford University batting averages with his 160 runs being scored at 22.85, and was described in <a href="James%20Lillywhite%27s%20Cricketers%27%20Annual">James Lillywhite's Cricketers' Annual</a> as being: "Sometimes a most dashing left-handed hitter, but not at all dependable; hard-working field."

Poor results in 1885 saw Somerset lose their first-class status for the following seasons. Somerset played just six matches in 1886 of which Hewett played two, top-scoring with 69 against Devon. An injury to his hand prevented him from playing all but one match for the university in his final year at Oxford, 1887, when "he would have had a good chance of retaining his place in the University eleven", according to "Wisden Cricketers' Almanack", although he was fit enough to score a century with a broomstick in a college match. During 1887, in a second-class match for Somerset against <a href="Warwickshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Warwickshire</a>, Hewett scored 98 to help Somerset to an innings victory, scoring the first 92 runs in less than an hour, an unusually high rate of scoring.

The next year, 1888, he scored successive half-centuries for Somerset early in the season against Warwickshire and <a href="Staffordshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Staffordshire</a> before making his debut for the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC). Facing Oxford University, Hewett made zero and eight for the London club. The same summer, Hewett was selected to play for an England XI against the touring <a href="Australia%20national%20cricket%20team">Australians</a>, and in a ten wicket win for the tourists, he scored 12 and 1. Between 1884 and 1888 Hewett had limited success at the first-class level, establishing a reputation as a useful, if erratic, hard-hitting middle-order batsman. He played a lot of club cricket, being a regular for Harrow Wanderers, and scoring 201 not out for Senior Common Room against Christ Church in 1888.

Hewett's appearances for Somerset in 1889 were more successful. Having previously appeared in the middle-order, Hewett switched to opening the innings at the start of the season, and took on the <a href="Captain%20%28cricket%29">captaincy</a>. He scored three half-centuries in the season: two against Warwickshire, and one against Staffordshire. He comfortably headed the Somerset batting with an average of 38 in matches against the other second-class counties. In his history of Somerset cricket, "Sunshine, Sixes and Cider", David Foot describes Hewett's selection policy as captain as being one that was more dependent on the cricketing ability of the player than "of <nowiki>[the player's]</nowiki> social charm and ability to drink into the early hours"—unlike some of his predecessors.

In 1890, his side were unbeaten against county opposition, winning the "Second-class County Championship". In an early season first-class appearance for <a href="A.%20J.%20Webbe">A. J. Webbe</a>'s XI, Hewett scored his maiden first-class century, reaching 114 against Cambridge University. Later in May, for the MCC against Oxford University, he scored 71. Hewett top-scored with 65 in the second-innings of Somerset's opening county match of 1890, and two matches later scored 64 during a first-wicket partnership of 115 with Lionel Palairet against <a href="Leicestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Leicestershire</a>. A string of lower scores followed for just under a month before Somerset hosted Staffordshire at <a href="County%20Ground%2C%20Taunton">Taunton</a>. Having dismissed the visitors for 43, Hewett remained 203 not out when he <a href="Declaration%20and%20forfeiture">declared</a> the Somerset innings closed, scored in four hours, "a remarkable display of powerful and well-timed hitting". He did not pass 100 again that season, but came close during the <a href="Scarborough%20Festival">Scarborough Festival</a>, being bowled for 99 in the second-innings for the Gentlemen of England. Hewett led Somerset's batting averages in 1890, during which the club won twelve and <a href="Result%20%28cricket%29%23Tie">tied</a> one of their thirteen matches against county opposition. Due to this record the county were admitted to the <a href="County%20Championship">County Championship</a> for 1891 after a unanimous vote, regaining their first-class status.

While <a href="James%20Lillywhite%27s%20Cricketers%27%20Annual">Red Lillywhite</a> assessed him as "a dangerous left-hand bat, very free, but somewhat uncertain; good point", after the 1889 season, a year later he was described as "one of the very best left-hand bats in England, hitting hard all round; excellent point. Captain in 1889–1890, which post he filled with wonderful judgement." At the end of the 1890 season he was presented with a handsome silver flask by members of Somerset County Cricket Club.

Hewett led his side in their first County Championship match starting on 18 May 1891. Although the club had played first-class cricket a few years earlier, the championship had only been formed the previous season. Their debut in the competition was interrupted by rain and finished a draw; Hewett top-scored in Somerset's only innings with 31. Somerset's next match was against reigning county champions <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a>. Lionel Palairet, <a href="Bill%20Roe%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Roe</a> and <a href="Sammy%20Woods">Sammy Woods</a> were all missing for various reasons, leaving Hewett with a depleted side and only two real bowlers; <a href="Ted%20Tyler">Ted Tyler</a> and <a href="George%20Nichols%20%28cricketer%29">George Nichols</a>. Surrey reached 449, and then bowled Somerset out twice, for 37 in each innings. When Surrey travelled to Taunton later that season, most likely expecting an easy win to secure a second consecutive championship, Hewett top-scored for his team with 55 in the first-innings as Somerset reached 194. Woods, Nichols and Tyler then secured a 40 run first-innings lead for the home side who added another 331 runs in their second-innings, Hewett contributing 42. The same trio of Somerset bowlers proceeded to bowl the champions out for a second time, the final wicket falling two minutes from the close of play, and their team recorded a 130-run victory. Hewett had a quiet season with the bat, in addition to his 55 against Surrey he passed 50 on only one other occasion; against Middlesex two weeks later. He totalled 514 runs during the season at an average of 19.76; his lowest average when playing eight or more innings in a season.

Following the close of the <a href="1891%20County%20Championship">1891 County Championship</a>, Hewett was part of <a href="Martin%20Hawke%2C%207th%20Baron%20Hawke">Lord Hawke</a>'s <a href="Lord%20Hawke%27s%20XI%20cricket%20team%20in%20North%20America%20in%201891%E2%80%9392">party</a> which toured North America, playing six matches in the United States of America and two in Canada. Sammy Woods wrote that Hewett, along with <a href="Charles%20Wreford-Brown">Charles Wreford-Brown</a> and <a href="George%20Ricketts">George Ricketts</a>, became very <a href="Seasickness">seasick</a> on the journey there. The first two matches were first-class fixtures against the <a href="Philadelphian%20cricket%20team">Gentlemen of Philadelphia</a>. Hewett scored 30 and 49 in the first, an eight wicket loss which Woods blamed on taking place too soon after their arrival, claiming the team "had hardly found our land-legs." The first match had yielded an aggregate of 861 runs, the second contained only 352, of which Hewett scored 10 and 29. His captain, Lord Hawke, was the only other batsman to reach double figures in both innings as the touring side won by four wickets. None of the remaining fixtures on the tour had first-class status, and not all were eleven-a-side contests. Hewett scored 113 against the sixteen man All New York on <a href="Staten%20Island">Staten Island</a>, a match in which he was standing in as captain due to Lord Hawke being ill. Woods rated Hewett, along with Lord Hawke and Brown, as the best batsmen on the tour.

Hewett's first three matches of the 1892 season were for representative sides against the universities. He reached double figures in each of his six innings, and scored a half-century for the Gentlemen of England against Cambridge. On returning to Somerset, he did not score a half-century until his third match, making 54 against Oxford University. He passed 50 on twelve occasions during the season, the most during any season of his career. In late August, playing <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a>, Hewett scored 201 out of a partnership of 346, establishing a record for the first wicket in first-class cricket, surpassing <a href="W.G.%20Grace">W.G. Grace</a> and <a href="Bransby%20Cooper">Bransby Cooper</a>'s 1869 total of 283. Although their record has since been beaten in first-class cricket, it remains Somerset's record partnership for the first wicket. Their partnership was described as "Pure grace at one end, sheer force at the other", in <a href="Harry%20Altham">H.S. Altham</a> and <a href="E.%20W.%20Swanton">E. W. Swanton</a>'s "A History of Cricket". At the time, "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" reported that the pair remained together for three and half hours, during which Hewett scored 30 <a href="Boundary%20%28cricket%29%23Scoring%20runs">fours</a>.

Hewett finished the season with 1,047 runs for Somerset, making him the only batsman in England to score 1,000 runs in county matches. In total he scored 1,407 first-class runs, the most by any batsman, and was third in the amateur batting averages. He was named as one of the <a href="Wisden%20Cricketer%20of%20the%20Year">Five Batsmen of the Year</a> by the "Wisden Cricketers' Almanack" in 1893, in which it was claimed that "had it been necessary last August <nowiki>[1892]</nowiki> to put a representative England eleven into the field, Hewett would undoubtedly have been given a place." Under Hewett's captaincy, Somerset won eight, drew three and lost five matches in 1892, finishing third in the <a href="County%20Championship">County Championship</a>, which would remain their highest position for over 100 years, until the county were runners-up in the competition in 2001. "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" praised the county's achievements during the year, and reserved special praise for Hewett; "Somerset's many brilliant feats, and the fine play of Messrs. Hewett and Palairet in particular, were a marked feature of this year's cricket." After the close of the County Championship, Hewett appeared in three representative matches, captaining the West to victory over the East, and appearing under the captaincy of W.G. Grace for both the <a href="North%20v%20South">South</a> and the <a href="Gentlemen%20v%20Players">Gentlemen v Players</a>.

Hewett began the 1893 season in good form, reaching his half-century in each of his first three matches for the county, including a total of 94 against Oxford University in late May. Hewett missed most of the match against Kent shortly after, returning to Taunton due to the death of his brother-in-law, during which time <a href="George%20Wood%20%28Somerset%20cricketer%29">George Wood</a> replaced him as a <a href="Substitute%20%28cricket%29">substitute</a>. In July 1893, the touring <a href="Australia%20national%20cricket%20team">Australians</a> played Somerset at Taunton for the first time since 1882, when both the ground and the county team were barely established. After the success of the 1892 season, and because talented, Australian-born Sammy Woods was playing for Somerset, the match was eagerly anticipated. Thousands arrived in Taunton for the match, but after overnight torrential rain, the <a href="Umpire%20%28cricket%29">umpires</a> inspected the pitch at 11:00 and abandoned play for the day. In his history of the county club, Roebuck suggest that they may have been put under pressure by the Australians or by Hewett himself. The Somerset fans and members were angry at the decision, but the Australians packed picnic baskets and after exchanging strong words with the locals, departed for the <a href="Quantock%20Hills">Quantock Hills</a>. Hewett, along with Woods and <a href="Vernon%20Hill%20%28cricketer%29">Vernon Hill</a>, arranged to play golf in <a href="Minehead">Minehead</a>. The crowd continued to show their dismay at the decision, and eventually the Somerset officials asked the umpires to take another look at the ground. Woods supported this decision in his reminiscences, claiming that "the decision not to play was premature." At 14:00, after their second inspection, the umpires retracted their previous decision and announced that play could start. Hewett reacted angrily, and argued unsuccessfully against the decision with the Somerset committee. The Australian players were recalled from their picnic, and play began at 16:00, although neither team particularly wanted to play. Roebuck recorded that "Hewett, in particular, was in high dudgeon and... he threw away his wicket for 12 runs, having been dropped once." David Foot offered a more tempered opinion, saying simply that Hewett's "mind wasn't on the game." No play was possible on the second day, and on the third, Australia won the match by six wickets. Hewett felt let down by the Somerset committee, who he felt had undermined his authority, prompting him to say that "if a captain can't lead at Taunton, this is no place for him." Although friends thought he was overreacting, he declared that he would resign from the captaincy and the club at the end of the season. Both Foot and Roebuck suggested that Hewett reacted in an over-sensitive and extreme manner, but that his lack of self-control may have limited his long-term captaincy prospects.

In his five further games for Somerset before the end of the season Hewett hit two centuries. He reached 120 runs against <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a> and against <a href="Gloucestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Gloucestershire</a>, on his final appearance for the county, he scored 112 runs in just under two hours; according to "<a href="James%20Lillywhite%27s%20Cricketers%27%20Annual">James Lillywhite's Cricketers' Annual</a>", it "was a splendid display". He scored 1,092 runs in total during 1893, of which his 669 for Somerset in the championship were scored at an average of 31.85, topping the county's batting charts. During his five seasons of first-class cricket for Somerset, he played 51 matches and scored 2,592 runs at an average of 30.85.

After leaving Somerset, Hewett did not continue in county cricket at all, opting to play first-class cricket only for amateur and representative sides. At the tail-end of the 1893 season, he played three times for the South, scoring two half-centuries. In July 1894, Hewett made the second of his two appearances for the <a href="Gentlemen%20v%20Players">Gentlemen</a> against the Players. Unlike his first appearance, made at <a href="Central%20Recreation%20Ground%2C%20Hastings">Hastings</a>, the match was played at <a href="Lord%27s%20Cricket%20Ground">Lord's Cricket Ground</a>, which was generally considered to be the more prestigious Gentlemen v Players fixture of the season, being the more representative. These matches were keenly contested during the 1890s, and were considered to be second in prestige only to gaining a Test cap. Batting at number three, Hewett scored 12 runs out of the Gentlemen's total of 254, before <a href="Stanley%20Jackson">Stanley Jackson</a> and Hewett's former Somerset colleague, <a href="Sammy%20Woods">Sammy Woods</a>, bowled the Players out for 108 and 107. He appeared 11 times in 1894, scoring 579 runs at an average of 34.05, higher than the previous season. Woods described Hewett as being "in splendid form" when he played, and lamented that he was no longer playing for Somerset. He scored his only century of the season for A. J. Webbe's XI, reaching 110 after opening the innings against Oxford University. He continued his form with the bat into 1895, twice scoring centuries for the Gentlemen against the universities, making 109 against Cambridge, and 102 against Oxford. During this season Hewett appeared in his first match for the amateur side <a href="I%20Zingari">I Zingari</a>, who had strong links with both <a href="Harrow%20School">Harrow School</a> and Somerset president Sir <a href="Spencer%20Ponsonby-Fane">Spencer Ponsonby-Fane</a>.

Hewett played all three matches of the 1895 Scarborough Festival; he opened the innings for the MCC against Yorkshire, and then captained the South in their loss against the North. In the third match, Hewett was named captain of an England XI, a compliment for the former Somerset captain. However, rain meant that the start was delayed. Unlike a couple of years earlier, Hewett was happy to ignore the puddles in the field and start the match at the scheduled time. The umpires disagreed with him, and the crowd, wanting cricket, blamed Hewett for the delay and lack of sport. When he belatedly led his side onto the field, the spectators threw insults at him until the Yorkshire captain, Lord Hawke, shouted "Keep quiet or I'll think about calling the game off". Hewett did not bother with such threats, and left the field, got changed and departed from the ground, taking no further part in the game. <a href="Fred%20Spofforth">Fred Spofforth</a> replaced him in the match which the England side went on to win by nine wickets.

During the English winter of 1895–96, Hewett once again toured with Lord Hawke, travelling to South Africa. Arriving too late to take part in the first match of the tour, he then played the next four matches, but was summoned back to England by important business. The tour included three matches against a <a href="South%20Africa%20national%20cricket%20team">South African national team</a> which were deemed to be <a href="Test%20cricket">Tests</a>, but by this stage of the tour Hewett had left South Africa, and he thus completed his cricket career without any Test appearances. He played his final first-class match in 1896, scoring 86 for the MCC against Oxford University. In this match, for unknown reasons, he appeared as "Mr. H Herbert".
"When Mr 'Herbert' came in to bat ... many of the spectators in the free seats did not recognise him, but after he had sampled an over or two, an old gentleman, who had shown some knowledge of the game, hit the nail on the head when he remarked: I don't remember to have seen this Mr 'Erbert' before but he's 'class'." He continued to play cricket for the Harrow Wanderers, MCC and I Zingari until 1901. At the time of the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Census%201901">1901 Census</a>, Hewett was living in <a href="Westminster">Westminster</a>. He was listed as head of the household, the only other resident being a servant.

Hewett practised as a <a href="barrister">barrister</a>, having trained at the <a href="Inner%20Temple">Inner Temple</a>, where he passed at least one exam in 1890. During the First World War, he served in the <a href="Territorial%20Force">Territorial Force Reserve</a> as an Assistant <a href="Provost%20Marshal">Provost Marshal</a>, an appointment which he held from 7 September 1915 until 24 May 1918. He died in <a href="Hove">Hove</a>, Sussex on 4 March 1921, and his funeral was held in Norton Fitzwarren four days later. His obituary in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" describes only Hewett's cricket career, and does not give any details about his later life. It does not mention a spouse or any children. The notice of his funeral in the same paper says: "The whole village [of Norton Fitzwarren] was in mourning and among those present at the graveside were Mr H. E. Murray Anderdon, president, and Mr S. M. J. Woods, secretary of the Somerset Cricket Club."

When Hewett was named as one of the Five Batsmen of the Year by "Wisden Cricketers' Almanack" in 1893, the publication described him as "the finest left-handed batsman in England". He played in an unorthodox but attractive fashion, which prompted <a href="W.G.%20Grace">W.G. Grace</a> to praise "his dashing and fearless hitting", while remarking that he had an awkward style. In "Somerset, Cider and Sixes", David Foot described that he was "possessed of an eagle eye, considerable meat and the ability to make his forcing shots attractive." In <a href="Peter%20Roebuck">Peter Roebuck</a>'s "From Sammy to Jimmy", he offered a similar portrait of Hewett's batting style, adding that "he saw it as his task to conquer". Hewett's batting received praise in <a href="Harry%20Altham">H. S. Altham</a> and <a href="E.%20W.%20Swanton">E. W. Swanton</a>'s "A History of Cricket", where he is described as a "singularly determined and venomous" batsman who "hit the ball in unexpected and demoralizing directions." He frequently scored his runs rapidly, as described by the Reverend R.S. Holmes, who wrote of his batting against <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a>; "the Captain scored at his usual rate – three out of four runs notched, represent his pace. Against Surrey he got 61 out of 81, this time 60 out of the same total. That's the kind of example every captain should set – a run a minute, or thereabouts." In summary of the 1892 season "The Cricket Annual" notes that "the Somerset player, in fact, had established the reputation of being the most punishing batsman and rapid scorer of the day, and on last season's form no representative eleven could be considered complete without him." Sammy Woods claimed that Hewett disliked fielding, but offered the view that he was good at <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">point</a>. Woods also related how Hewett would chew on a toothpick, which he always had in his mouth when fielding, when his team was losing.

As evidenced by the manner in which Hewett left Somerset and walked off during the Scarborough Festival of 1895, he possessed a short fuse. Teammate <a href="Frederic%20John%20Poynton">Frederic John Poynton</a> characterised his captain as a player who suffered "from a deep, difficult nature, which once upset, took long to recover". He was a strong leader who was both respected and feared by his colleagues. In 1885, Somerset County Cricket Club had failed to field eleven players for some of their first-class contests, and in most of their other matches were a poor side. Hewett took on the county captaincy in 1889, and in his second year led his side unbeaten against fellow county opposition to win the 'Second-class County Championship', and gain re-admission to the first-class game. Hewett's batting and captaincy were aided by the emergence of Woods and Palairet, both of whom were named as "Wisden" Cricketers of the Year between 1889 and 1893. In 1891, Somerset finished joint fifth among the nine first-class counties, while the subsequent year they rose to third. Hewett's final season at Somerset was the county's least successful under his captaincy, winning just four of their sixteen matches to finish in eighth.

Russula emetica

Russula emetica, commonly known as the sickener, emetic russula, or vomiting russula, is a <a href="basidiomycete">basidiomycete</a> <a href="mushroom">mushroom</a>, and the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of the genus "<a href="Russula">Russula</a>". It has a red, convex to flat <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> up to in diameter, with a <a href="cap%20cuticle">cuticle</a> that can be peeled off almost to the centre. The <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> are white to pale cream, and closely spaced. A smooth white <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a> measures up to long and thick. First described in 1774, the mushroom has a wide distribution in the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>, where it grows on the ground in damp woodlands in a <a href="mycorrhiza">mycorrhiza</a>l association with <a href="conifer">conifer</a>s, especially <a href="pine">pine</a>.

The mushroom's <a href="common%20name">common name</a>s refer to the gastrointestinal distress they cause when consumed raw. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is extremely peppery, but this offensive taste, along with its <a href="poisonous%20mushroom">toxicity</a>, can be removed by <a href="parboiling">parboiling</a> or <a href="pickling">pickling</a>. Although it used to be widely eaten in Russia and eastern European countries, it is generally not recommended for consumption. There are many similar "Russula" species that have a red cap with white stem and gills, some of which can be reliably distinguished from "R. emetica" only by microscopic characteristics.

"Russula emetica" was first officially <a href="species%20description">described</a> as "Agaricus emeticus" by <a href="Jacob%20Christian%20Sch%C3%A4ffer">Jacob Christian Schaeffer</a> in 1774, in his series on fungi of <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a> and the <a href="Palatinate%20%28region%29">Palatinate</a>, "Fungorum qui in Bavaria et Palatinatu circa Ratisbonam nascuntur icones." <a href="Christian%20Hendrik%20Persoon">Christian Hendrik Persoon</a> placed it in its current genus "Russula" in 1796, where it remains. According to the nomenclatural database <a href="MycoBank">MycoBank</a>, "Agaricus russula" is a <a href="synonym%20%28biology%29">synonym</a> of "R. emetica" that was published by <a href="Giovanni%20Antonio%20Scopoli">Giovanni Antonio Scopoli</a> in 1772, two years earlier than Schaeffer's description. However, this name is unavailable as Persoon's name is <a href="sanctioned%20name">sanctioned</a>. Additional synonyms include <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Lamarck">Jean-Baptiste Lamarck</a>'s "Amanita rubra" (1783), and <a href="Augustin%20Pyramus%20de%20Candolle">Augustin Pyramus de Candolle</a>'s subsequent <a href="Combinatio%20nova">new combination</a> "Agaricus ruber" (1805). The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a>
"emetikos"/εμετικος 'emetic' or 'vomit-inducing'. Similarly, its <a href="common%20name">common name</a>s of "sickener", "emetic russula", and "vomiting russula" also refer to this attribute.

"Russula emetica" is the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of the genus "Russula". According to <a href="Rolf%20Singer">Rolf Singer</a>'s infrageneric <a href="classification%20%28biology%29">classification</a> of "Russula", it is also the type of the <a href="section%20%28botany%29">section</a> "Russula". In an alternative classification proposed by <a href="Henri%20Romagnesi">Henri Romagnesi</a>, it is the type species of subsection "Emeticinae". A <a href="molecular%20phylogenetic">molecular</a> analysis of European "Russula" species determined that "R. emetica" groups in a <a href="clade">clade</a> with "<a href="Russula%20raoultii">R. raoultii</a>", "<a href="Russula%20betularum">R. betularum</a>", and "<a href="Russula%20nana">R. nana</a>"; a later analysis confirmed the close <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> relationship between "R. emetica" and the latter two Russulas.

The sticky <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> of "R. emetica" is wide, with a shape ranging from convex (in young specimens) to flattened, sometimes with a central depression, and sometimes with a shallow <a href="umbo%20%28mycology%29">umbo</a>. It is a bright scarlet or cherry red, and in maturity, the margins have fine radial grooves extending towards the center of the cap. The <a href="pileipellis">cuticle</a> can be readily peeled from the cap almost to the centre. The brittle <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is white (or tinged with red directly under the cap cuticle), measures thick, and has a very sharp and peppery taste. <a href="Lamella%20%28mycology%29">Gills</a> are closely spaced, white to creamy-white, and have an attachment to the <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a> ranging from <a href="wikt%3Aadnate">adnate</a> to <a href="wikt%3Aadnexed">adnexed</a> or completely free. They are intervenose (containing cross-veins in the spaces between the gills) and occasionally forked near the cap margin. Fruit bodies have a slightly fruity or spicy smell.

The white stem measures long by thick, and is roughly the same width throughout its length, although it can be a bit thicker near the base. Its surface is dry and smooth, sometimes marked by faint longitudinal grooves. It is either stuffed (filled with a cottony pith) or partially hollow, and lacks a <a href="annulus%20%28mycology%29">ring</a> or <a href="partial%20veil">partial veil</a>.

"Russula emetica" produces a white to yellowish-white <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a>. <a href="Spores">Spores</a> are roughly elliptical to egg-shaped, with a strongly warted and partially reticulate (web-like) surface. They have dimensions of 8.8–11.0 by 6.6–8 <a href="micrometre">μm</a>, and are <a href="amyloid%20%28mycology%29">amyloid</a>, meaning that they will <a href="staining">stain</a> blue, bluish-grey, to blackish in <a href="Melzer%27s%20reagent">Melzer's reagent</a>. <a href="Basidia">Basidia</a> (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a> (translucent), and measure 32.9–50 by 9.0–11.6 μm. <a href="Cystidia">Cystidia</a> located on the gill face (pleurocystidia) are somewhat cylindrical to club-shaped or somewhat spindle-shaped, and measure 35–88 by 7.3–12.4 μm. They are yellowish, and contain <a href="granule%20%28cell%20biology%29">granular</a> contents. Cheilocystidia (found on the edges of the gills), which are similar in shape to the pleurocystidia, are thin-walled, hyaline, and measure 14–24 by 4.4–7.3 μm. <a href="Clamp%20connection">Clamp connection</a>s are absent from the <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e.

The red <a href="pigment">pigment</a>s of this and other russulas are water-soluble to some degree, and fruit bodies will often bleach or fade with rain or sunlight; the cap colour of older specimens may fade to pink or orange, or develop white blotches. The main pigment responsible for the red colour of the fruit bodies is called "russularhodin", but little is known of its chemical composition.

As its name implies, the sickener is inedible, though not as dangerous as sometimes described in older mushroom guides. The symptoms are mainly gastrointestinal in nature: <a href="nausea">nausea</a>, <a href="diarrhoea">diarrhoea</a>, vomiting, and <a href="colic">colic</a>ky abdominal cramps. These symptoms typically begin half an hour to three hours after ingestion of the mushroom, and usually subside spontaneously, or shortly after the ingested material has been expelled from the <a href="human%20gastrointestinal%20tract">intestinal tract</a>. The active agents have not been identified but are thought to be <a href="sesquiterpene">sesquiterpene</a>s, which have been isolated from the related genus "<a href="Lactarius">Lactarius</a>" and from "<a href="Russula%20sardonia">Russula sardonia</a>". Sesquiterpenoids that have been identified from "R. emetica" include the previously known compounds lactarorufin A, furandiol, methoxyfuranalcohol, and an unnamed compound unique to this species.

The bitter taste does disappear on cooking and it is said to then be <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a>, though consumption is not recommended. The mushroom used to be widely eaten in eastern European countries and Russia after <a href="parboiling">parboiling</a> (which removes the toxins), and then salting or <a href="pickling">pickling</a>. In some regions of Hungary and Slovakia, the cap cuticle is removed and used as a spice for <a href="goulash">goulash</a>. Both the <a href="red%20squirrel">red squirrel</a> ("Sciurus vulgaris") and the <a href="American%20red%20squirrel">American red squirrel</a> ("Tamiasciurus hudsonicus") are known to <a href="foraging">forage</a> for, store and eat "R. emetica". Other creatures that have been documented consuming the mushroom include the snail "<a href="Mesodon%20thyroidus">Mesodon thyroidus</a>", several species of <a href="slug">slug</a>s (including "<a href="Arion%20ater">Arion ater</a>", "<a href="Arion%20subfuscus">A. subfuscus</a>", "<a href="Arion%20intermedius">A. intermedius</a>", "<a href="Limax%20maximus">Limax maximus</a>", "<a href="Limax%20cinereoniger">L. cinereoniger</a>", and "<a href="Deroceras%20reticulatum">Deroceras reticulatum</a>"), the fruit flies "<a href="Drosophila%20falleni">Drosophila falleni</a>" and "<a href="Drosophila%20quinaria">D. quinaria</a>", and the <a href="fungus%20gnat">fungus gnat</a> "<a href="Allodia%20bipexa">Allodia bipexa</a>".

"Russula emetica" is one of over 100 red-capped "Russula" species known worldwide. The related beechwood sickener ("<a href="Russula%20nobilis">R. nobilis</a>") is found under <a href="beech">beech</a> in Europe. Many, such as the bloody brittlegill ("<a href="Russula%20sanguinaria">R. sanguinaria</a>"), are inedible; this species can be distinguished from "R. emetica" by the reddish flush in its stem. Among the edible lookalikes, there is <a href="Russula%20paludosa">"R. padulosa"</a>, commonly found in Europe and North America. "<a href="Russula%20aurea">R. aurea</a>" has a yellow stem, gills and flesh under its red cap. The edible "<a href="Russula%20rugulosa">R. rugulosa</a>"—common in mixed woods in the eastern and northern United States—has a wrinkled and pimpled cap cuticle, cream spores, and mild taste. Another inedible species, "<a href="Russula%20fragilis">R. fragilis</a>", has notched gills, and its stem stains blue with <a href="1-Naphthol">naphthol</a>. The uncommon European subspecies "R. emetica longipes" is distinguished by its longer stem and ochre gills. The paler European mushroom "R. betularum", found in coniferous forests and <a href="moorland">moorland</a>, is sometimes considered a subspecies of "R. emetica". "R. nana" is restricted in distribution to <a href="climate%20of%20the%20Arctic">arctic</a> and <a href="subarctic%20climate">subarctic</a> <a href="highland">highland</a> meadows where <a href="dwarf%20willow">dwarf willow</a> ("Salix herbacea") or <a href="alpine%20bearberry">alpine bearberry</a> ("Arctostaphylos alpina") are abundant.

Like all species of "Russula", "R. emetica" is <a href="mycorrhiza">mycorrhiza</a>l, and forms <a href="mutualism%20%28biology%29">mutually beneficial</a> partnerships with roots of trees and certain herbaceous plants. Preferred <a href="host%20%28biology%29">host</a> plants are <a href="conifer">conifer</a>s, especially <a href="pine">pine</a>s. Fruit bodies grow singly, scattered, or in groups in <a href="sphagnum%20moss">sphagnum moss</a> near bogs, and in <a href="coniferous%20forest">coniferous</a> and <a href="mixed%20forest">mixed forest</a>s. The fungus occasionally fruits on <a href="humus">humus</a> or on very rotten wood. The mushroom is known from North Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America, and can be locally very common. There is some doubt over the extent of its range in North America, as some sightings refer to the related "<a href="Russula%20silvicola">R. silvicola</a>"; initially the name "Russula emetica" was often applied to any red-capped white "Russula". Sightings in Australia are now referred to the similarly coloured "<a href="Russula%20persanguinea">R. persanguinea</a>".

A multi-year field study of the growth of "R. emetica" production in a <a href="scots%20pine">scots pine</a> plantation in Scotland found that total productivity was 0.24–0.49 million mushrooms per hectare per year (roughly 0.1–0.2 million mushrooms/acre/year), corresponding to a fresh weight of 265–460 kg per hectare per year (49–85 lb/acre/year). Productivity was highest from August to October. The longevity of the mushrooms was estimated to be 4–7 days. In a study of the fungal <a href="biodiversity">diversity</a> of ectomycorrhizal species in a <a href="Sitka%20spruce">Sitka spruce</a> forest, "R. emetica" was one of the top five dominant fungi. Comparing the frequency of fruit body production between 10-, 20-, 30-, or 40-year-old forest stands, "R. emetica" was most prolific in the latter.

Suillus luteus

Suillus luteus is a <a href="bolete">bolete</a> fungus, and the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of the genus "<a href="Suillus">Suillus</a>". A common fungus native to Eurasia, from the British Isles to Korea, it has been <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> widely elsewhere, including North and South America, southern Africa, Australia and New Zealand. Commonly referred to as slippery jack or sticky bun in English-speaking countries, its names refer to the brown <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a>, which is characteristically slimy in wet conditions. The fungus, initially described as "Boletus luteus" by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in 1753, is now classified in a different <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> as well as <a href="genus">genus</a>. "Suillus luteus" is <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a>, though not as highly regarded as other bolete mushrooms, and is commonly prepared and eaten in soups, stews or fried dishes. The slime coating, however, may cause <a href="indigestion">indigestion</a> if not removed before eating.

The fungus grows in <a href="coniferous%20forest">coniferous forest</a>s in its native range, and pine <a href="plantation">plantation</a>s in countries where it has become naturalized. It forms <a href="symbiotic">symbiotic</a> <a href="ectomycorrhiza">ectomycorrhiza</a>l associations with living trees by enveloping the tree's underground roots with sheaths of fungal tissue. The fungus produces <a href="spore">spore</a>-bearing <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a>, often in large numbers, above ground in summer and autumn. The fruit body cap often has a distinctive conical shape before flattening with age, reaching up to in diameter. Like other boletes, it has tubes extending downward from the underside of the cap, rather than <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a>; spores escape at maturity through the tube openings, or pores. The pore surface is yellow, and covered by a membranous <a href="partial%20veil">partial veil</a> when young. The pale <a href="Stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a>, or stem, measures up to 10 cm (4 in) tall and thick and bears small dots near the top. Unlike most other boletes, it bears a distinctive membranous <a href="annulus%20%28mycology%29">ring</a> that is tinged brown to violet on the underside.

The slippery jack was one of the many species first <a href="species%20description">described</a> in 1753 by the "father of taxonomy" <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a>, who, in the second volume of his "<a href="Species%20Plantarum">Species Plantarum</a>", gave it the name "Boletus luteus". The <a href="botanical%20name">specific epithet</a> is the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> adjective "lūtěus", meaning "yellow". The fungus was reclassified as (and became the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of) the genus "<a href="Suillus">Suillus</a>" by French naturalist <a href="Henri%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Anne%20de%20Roussel">Henri François Anne de Roussel</a> in 1796. "Suillus" is an ancient term for fungi, and is derived from "swine". In addition to the <a href="British%20Mycological%20Society">British Mycological Society</a> approved name "slippery jack", other <a href="common%20name">common name</a>s for this bolete include "pine boletus" and "sticky bun"—the latter referring to its resemblance to the <a href="sticky%20bun">identically named dessert</a>.

German naturalist <a href="August%20Batsch">August Batsch</a> described "Boletus volvatus" (the specific epithet derived from the Latin "volva", meaning "sheath", "covering" or "womb") alongside "B. luteus" in his 1783 work "Elenchus Fungorum". Batsch placed both of these species, along with "<a href="Suillus%20bovinus">B. bovinus</a>" and the now obsolete names "Boletus mutabilis" and "B. canus", in a grouping of similar boletes he called "<a href="Order%20%28biology%29%23Hierarchy%20of%20ranks">subordo</a> Suilli". "Boletus volvatus" is now considered a <a href="synonym%20%28biology%29">synonym</a> of "Suillus luteus". Several authors have placed the slippery jack in other genera: Finnish mycologist <a href="Petter%20Adolf%20Karsten">Petter Karsten</a> classified it as "Cricunopus luteus" in 1881—the genus "Cricinopus" defined by yellow <a href="adnation">adnate</a> tubes; <a href="Lucien%20Qu%C3%A9let">Lucien Quélet</a> classified it as "Viscipellis luteus" in 1886, and "Ixocomus luteus" in 1888; and <a href="Paul%20Christoph%20Hennings">Paul Christoph Hennings</a> placed it in the <a href="section%20%28botany%29">section</a> "Cricinopus" of the genus "<a href="Boletopsis">Boletopsis</a>" in 1900.

In works published before 1987, the slippery jack was written fully as , as the description by Linnaeus had been <a href="sanctioned%20name">name sanctioned</a> in 1821 by the "father of mycology", Swedish naturalist Elias Magnus Fries. The starting date for all the <a href="mycota">mycota</a> had been set by general agreement as 1 January 1821, the date of Fries's work. Furthermore, as Roussel's description of "Suillus" predated this as well, the authority for the genus was assigned to British botanist Samuel Frederick Gray in the first volume of his 1821 work "A Natural Arrangement of British Plants". The 1987 edition of the <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Botanical%20Nomenclature">International Code of Botanical Nomenclature</a> changed the rules on the starting date and primary work for names of fungi, and names can now be considered <a href="Validly%20published%20name%20%28botany%29">valid</a> as far back as 1 May 1753, the date of publication of Linnaeus's work. In 1986, a collection of fruit bodies from Sweden was designated as the <a href="neotype">neotype</a> of "Suillus luteus".

In their 1964 <a href="monograph">monograph</a> on North American "Suillus" species, <a href="Alexander%20H.%20Smith">Alexander H. Smith</a> and <a href="Harry%20Delbert%20Thiers">Harry Delbert Thiers</a> classified "S. luteus" in the <a href="series%20%28botany%29">series</a> "Suilli" of the <a href="section%20%28biology%29">section</a> "Suillus" in genus "Suillus". This group is characterized by the presence of either a ring on the stipe, a partial veil adhering to the cap margin, or a "false veil" not attached to the stipe but initially covering the tube cavity. Species closely related to "Suillus luteus" include "<a href="Suillus%20pseudobrevipes">S. pseudobrevipes</a>" (a <a href="sister%20group">sister</a> species), "<a href="Suillus%20brevipes">S. brevipes</a>" and "<a href="Suillus%20weaverae">S. weaverae</a>" (formerly "Fuscoboletinus weaverae"). A genetic study of <a href="nucleotide">nucleotide</a> DNA reinforced the species' <a href="monophyly">monophyly</a> and low <a href="genetic%20divergence">genetic divergence</a>, with material of "S. luteus" from the United Kingdom, Austria, Germany and North America forming a <a href="clade">clade</a>, in contrast with some other species, such as "<a href="Suillus%20granulatus">S. granulatus</a>", which were shown to be <a href="polyphyletic">polyphyletic</a>.

Chemical analysis of <a href="biological%20pigment">pigments</a> and <a href="wikt%3Achromogen">chromogens</a> showed that "Suillus" was more closely related to "<a href="Gomphidius">Gomphidius</a>" and "<a href="Rhizopogon">Rhizopogon</a>" than to other boletes, and hence "Suillus luteus" and its allies were transferred from the <a href="Boletaceae">Boletaceae</a> to the newly <a href="circumscription%20%28taxonomy%29">circumscribed</a> family <a href="Suillaceae">Suillaceae</a> in 1997. <a href="Molecular%20phylogenetics">Molecular</a> studies have reinforced how distantly related these fungi are from "<a href="Boletus%20edulis">Boletus edulis</a>" and its allies.

The <a href="Pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> is <a href="Chestnut%20%28color%29">chestnut</a>, <a href="Rust%20%28color%29">rusty</a>, <a href="Olive%20%28color%29">olive</a> brown, or dark brown in color and generally 4–10 cm (rarely to 13 cm) in diameter at maturity. The cap has a distinctive conical shape, later flattening out. It is slimy to the touch, bare, smooth, and glossy even when dry, and the <a href="pileipellis">cuticle</a> is easily peeled off. The tiny, circular pores of the <a href="Hymenium">tubes</a> are initially yellow but turn olive to dark yellow with maturity. Like the skin of the cap, they can be readily peeled away from the <a href="Trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a>.

Tubes comprising the <a href="hymenophore">hymenophore</a> on the underside of the cap are deep, with an attachment to the stipe ranging from <a href="adnation">adnate</a> to somewhat <a href="decurrent">decurrent</a>. The pores are tiny, numbering 3 per mm in young specimens and 1–2 per mm in maturity. The stipe is tall and wide. It is pale yellow and more or less cylindrical but may bear a swollen base. A membranous <a href="partial%20veil">partial veil</a> initially links the stipe with the edge of the cap. When it ruptures, it forms a membranous, hanging <a href="annulus%20%28mycology%29">ring</a>. The top side of the ring is whitish, while the underside is characteristically dark brown to violet. This species is one of the few members of the genus "Suillus" that have such a ring. Above the ring, the stipe features glandular dots—minute clumps of pigmented cells. Below the ring, the stipe is dingy white, sometimes streaked with brownish slime. In humid conditions, the ring has a gelatinous texture. The white flesh of the entire fungus does not discolour when damaged, and is soft—particularly in mature specimens. It has a "pleasant" taste and lacks any distinctive odour.

The <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> is ochre or clay coloured, the elongated elliptical <a href="basidiospore">spores</a> measuring 7–10 by 3–3.5 <a href="micrometre">μm</a>. <a href="Basidia">Basidia</a> (spore-producing cells) are four spored, with dimensions of 14–18 by 4–5 μm. <a href="Cystidia">Cystidia</a> are present on both the tube faces (pleurocystidia) and edges (cheilocystidia), either scattered or, more rarely, as bundles. They measure 20–35 by 5–7 μm and have a narrow club shape. <a href="Clamp%20connection">Clamp connection</a>s are not present in the <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e of "S. luteus".

Good field characteristics for "Suillus luteus" include the slimy brown cap, glandular dots on the upper stipe, and prominent purplish ring. A frequent lookalike is "Suillus granulatus", which is another common, widely distributed and edible species occurring in the same habitat. "Suillus granulatus" is yellow fleshed and exudes <a href="latex">latex</a> droplets when young, but most conspicuously bears neither a partial veil nor a ring. Other than that, "Suillus luteus" is unlikely to be confused with other mushrooms, especially if its preferred habitat under pine trees and the whitish partial veil are considered. In Europe, the related "<a href="Suillus%20grevillei">Suillus grevillei</a>" is found under <a href="larch">larch</a> and has a yellow cap, while immature fruit bodies of "<a href="Gomphidius%20glutinosus">Gomphidius glutinosus</a>" may look comparable from above but have <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> rather than pores underneath. In North America, "<a href="Suillus%20borealis">Suillus borealis</a>" and "<a href="Suillus%20pseudobrevipes">S. pseudobrevipes</a>" also have partials veils, but lack the distinctive ring of "S. luteus". "<a href="Suillus%20cothurnatus">S. cothurnatus</a>" forms a band-like ring on the stipe that tends to be brownish rather than purplish.

In some specimens of "S. luteus", the partial veil separates from the stipe (rather than the cap margin), leaving cottony patches of veil hanging from the cap margin. In this state, fruit bodies can be confused with those of "<a href="Suillus%20albidipes">S. albidipes</a>". Unlike "S. luteus", however, "S. albidipes" does not have glandular dots on its stipe.

"Suillus luteus" can be found all over the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>. Native to Eurasia, it is widespread across the British Isles. To the east it has been recorded from Pakistan, where it was found along canals in <a href="Dashkin">Dashkin</a> in the district of <a href="Astore%20District">Astore</a>, and as far east as South Korea. It has also been widely <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> elsewhere by way of pine <a href="plantation">plantation</a>s around the globe. It is very commonly found in <a href="Monterey%20pine">Monterey pine</a> ("Pinus radiata") plantations, despite the tree being native to <a href="California">California</a> and hence not in the fungus' native range. In North America it is found in the <a href="Northeastern%20United%20States">northeast</a>, the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> and the <a href="southwestern%20United%20States">southwestern United States</a>. According to <a href="Ernst%20Both">Ernst Both</a>, it was <a href="Charles%20Horton%20Peck">Charles Horton Peck</a> who first suggested in 1887 that the fungus was introduced to <a href="New%20York%20State">New York State</a> on "<a href="Scots%20pine">Pinus sylvestris</a>". DNA studies show that the North American populations differ little genetically from European populations, supporting the idea that the fungus arrived to North America relatively recently as a result of human activity. "Suillus luteus" is found in coastal and mountainous pine forests and exhibits a tolerance of the northern latitudes. Southern Hemisphere locales where the slippery jack grow with plantation pines include South America, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. In southwestern Australia, the bolete is limited to areas of greater than 1000 mm (40 in) annual rainfall. It has been recorded as far north as the <a href="Darling%20Downs">Darling Downs</a> and southern <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>, and occasionally in <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>. The fungus fruits in spring, summer and fairly prolifically in autumn, following periods of wet weather. Mushrooms can appear in large troops or <a href="fairy%20ring">fairy ring</a>s.

In Ecuador, "Pinus radiata" plantations were planted extensively around <a href="Cotopaxi%20National%20Park">Cotopaxi National Park</a>, and "Suillus luteus" boletes appear in abundance year-round. A 1985 <a href="field%20study">field study</a> estimated production to be 3000–6000 mushrooms per <a href="hectare">hectare</a>—up to (dry weight) of mushrooms hectare per year. This continuous production contrasts with the bolete's seasonal appearance elsewhere. The fungus is not found in adjacent areas of native vegetation. The fruiting is so bountiful that the harvest of slippery jacks has become the main reason that pine plantations are established or maintained in parts of Ecuador. In southern Brazil, it has been recorded in plantations of slash pine ("<a href="Pinus%20elliottii">P. elliottii</a>") in the <a href="Municipalities%20of%20Brazil">municipalities</a> of <a href="Pelotas">Pelotas</a>, <a href="Nova%20Petr%C3%B3polis">Nova Petrópolis</a> and <a href="Canela%2C%20Rio%20Grande%20do%20Sul">Canela</a> in <a href="Rio%20Grande%20do%20Sul">Rio Grande do Sul</a>, and <a href="Colombo%2C%20Paran%C3%A1">Colombo</a> in <a href="Paran%C3%A1%20%28state%29">Paraná</a>. It is particularly common in plantations in <a href="Patagonia">Patagonia</a>. "Suillus luteus" is the commonest bolete encountered in the <a href="Falkland%20Islands">Falkland Islands</a>, where it is found in <a href="windbreak">windbreak</a>s and gardens.

In South Africa, "Suillus luteus" has been occasionally recorded under pines in <a href="Bloemfontein">Bloemfontein</a>, <a href="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a> and <a href="Royal%20Natal%20National%20Park">Royal Natal National Park</a>.

"Suillus luteus" is a <a href="pioneer%20species">pioneer species</a> that typically establishes itself in the early stages of forest <a href="ecological%20succession">succession</a>. The fungus forms <a href="mycorrhiza">mycorrhiza</a>l associations with various species of <a href="Pinus">pine</a>, including Scots pine ("<a href="Pinus%20sylvestris">P. sylvestris</a>"), black pine ("<a href="Pinus%20nigra">P. nigra</a>"), and Macedonian pine ("<a href="Pinus%20peuce">P. peuce</a>") in Europe, and red pine ("<a href="Pinus%20resinosa">P. resinosa</a>") and white pine ("<a href="Pinus%20strobus">P. strobus</a>") in North America. An "<a href="in%20vitro">in vitro</a>" experiment demonstrated that the species could form an ectomycorrhizal association with Aleppo pine ("<a href="Pinus%20halepensis">P. halepensis</a>"), a key species used in <a href="reforestation">reforestation</a> in the Mediterranean. A study of the ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with a lodgepole pine ("<a href="Pinus%20contorta">P. contorta</a>") invasion front near <a href="Coyhaique">Coyhaique</a>, Chile, showed that many invasive trees were supported by "S. luteus" as the sole mycorrhizal partner.

The <a href="ectomycorrhiza">ectomycorrhiza</a>e formed between the fungus and host plant can be influenced by soil microorganisms present in the <a href="mycorrhizosphere">mycorrhizosphere</a>. For example, soil bacteria from the genera "<a href="Paenibacillus">Paenibacillus</a>" and "<a href="Burkholderia">Burkholderia</a>" alter the branching structure of the root, whereas "<a href="Bacillus">Bacillus</a>" species increase root growth and mycorrhizal colonization. The fungus does not require a specific <a href="soil">soil</a> but seems to prefer <a href="acidic">acidic</a> and nutrient-deficient soil. "Suillus luteus" produces <a href="hydroxamic%20acid">hydroxamic acid</a>-based <a href="siderophore">siderophore</a>s, which are compounds that can <a href="Chelation">chelate</a> iron and extract it from the soil in nutrient-poor conditions. <a href="Ignacio%20Chapela">Ignacio Chapela</a> and colleagues analysed the carbon uptake of "S. luteus" in Ecuador, concluding pine plantations accompanied by "S. luteus" deplete carbon stored in the soil and raising concerns that these might not be a remedy for rising <a href="Carbon%20dioxide%20in%20Earth%27s%20atmosphere">carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere</a>.

The fungus has been shown to provide a protective effect against <a href="heavy%20metal%20%28chemical%20element%29">heavy metal</a> toxicity when associated with the host "Pinus sylvestris", preventing <a href="copper">copper</a> accumulation in the needles, and protecting seedlings against <a href="cadmium">cadmium</a> toxicity. Owing to its frequent rate of <a href="sexual%20reproduction">sexual reproduction</a> and the resulting extensive <a href="gene%20flow">gene flow</a> within populations, the fungus can rapidly <a href="evolution">evolve</a> a <a href="phenotypic%20trait">trait</a> to tolerate otherwise toxic levels of heavy metals in the environment. The genetic basis of this adaptation—intriguing to researchers investigating the <a href="bioremediation">bioremediation</a> potential of metal-adapted plants and their fungal associates—are contained in the <a href="genome%20sequence">genome sequence</a> of "S. luteus", published in 2015.
"Suillus luteus" fruit bodies are sometimes infested with <a href="larva">larva</a>e, though not nearly as often as "S. granulatus" or "B. edulis". Damage from maggots is much more common in warmer months, and rare late in the season with cooler weather. In a Finnish study, researchers found that 70–95% of fruit bodies collected from typical forest habitats were infested with larvae; the most common species were the <a href="fly">flies</a> "<a href="Mycetophila%20fungorum">Mycetophila fungorum</a>", "<a href="Pegomya%20deprimata">Pegomya deprimata</a>", and "<a href="Pegohylemyia%20silvatica">Pegohylemyia silvatica</a>". In contrast, other studies have shown that fruit bodies collected from pine plantations are relatively free of larvae. The fungus produces microscopic crystals of <a href="oxalic%20acid">oxalic acid</a> at the surface of its hyphae, a feature that is thought to help deter <a href="grazing">grazing</a> by the <a href="springtail">springtail</a> species "<a href="Folsomia%20candida">Folsomia candida</a>".

"Suillus luteus" is an <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible mushroom</a>. Although some authors regard it as one of low quality, and generally inferior to co-occurring species such as "<a href="Boletus%20pinophilus">Boletus pinophilus</a>", the species is considered a delicacy in <a href="Slavic%20peoples">Slavic</a> cultures (known as "maslyata" in Russian or "maślaki" in Polish, deriving from words meaning "buttery"). It was highly regarded in <a href="Calabria">Calabria</a>, even more than "<a href="Boletus%20edulis">Boletus edulis</a>", until the 1940s when increased interest in the latter species eclipsed the former. Mushrooms conforming to "Suillus luteus" are exported from Chile to Italy, and, since the 1970s, the United States. As of 2002, harvesters in Chile were paid on average <a href="US%24">US$</a>0.5 per kilogram of fruit bodies. In <a href="Burundi">Burundi</a>, "Suillus luteus" mushrooms are sold to Europeans as "cepes" in <a href="Bujumbura">Bujumbura</a> but not generally eaten by the <a href="Barundi">Barundi</a>. Based on samples collected from Chile, the boletes contain (as a percentage of <a href="dry%20matter">dry weight</a>) 20% <a href="dietary%20protein">protein</a>, 57% <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>s, 6% <a href="fat">fat</a>, and 6% <a href="Ash%20%28analytical%20chemistry%29">ash</a>. "Pinus radiata" plantations in southeastern Australia have become tourist attractions as people flock to them in autumn to pick slippery jacks and saffron milk-caps ("<a href="Lactarius%20deliciosus">Lactarius deliciosus</a>"); <a href="Belanglo%20State%20Forest">Belanglo State Forest</a> in particular has attracted large numbers of Polish foragers.

Slippery jacks do not keep for long after picking, nor are they suitable for drying, as their water content is too high. They are suited for frying, or cooking in stews and soups, either alone or with other mushroom species. <a href="Pur%C3%A9e">Purée</a>ing the mushroom is not recommended, however: "We once made the mistake of running it through a blender to make a soup. The result was a substance recommending itself for use when hanging wallpaper." "S. luteus" and other "Suillus" species may cause <a href="allergic">allergic</a> reactions in some people or <a href="indigestion">digestive</a> problems that appear to result from consuming the slimy skin. The fungus is better cooked before eating, and some authors recommend discarding the glutinous cuticle and tubes before cooking. Moreover, the skin can spoil other fungi with which slippery jacks are collected.

Inexpensive powdered "S. luteus" fruit bodies are sometimes added to the more expensive "B. edulis" mushroom soup powder, a fraudulent practice that is difficult to detect with <a href="microscopy">microscopy</a> because the tissues are no longer intact. This <a href="adulteration">adulteration</a> can be determined chemically, however, by testing for increased levels of the sugar alcohols <a href="arabitol">arabitol</a> and <a href="mannitol">mannitol</a>. The practice can also be determined with a <a href="DNA">DNA</a>-based method that is sensitive enough to detect the addition of 1–2% of "S. luteus" to "B. edulis" powder.

Russula virescens

Russula virescens is a <a href="basidiomycete">basidiomycete</a> <a href="mushroom">mushroom</a> of the <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Russula">Russula</a>", and is commonly known as the green-cracking russula, the quilted green russula, or the green brittlegill. It can be recognized by its distinctive pale green <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> that measures up to in diameter, the surface of which is covered with darker green angular patches. It has crowded white <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a>, and a firm, white <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a> that is up to tall and thick. Considered to be one of the best <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible mushroom</a>s of the genus "Russula", it is especially popular in Spain and China. With a taste that is described variously as mild, nutty, fruity, or sweet, it is cooked by <a href="grilling">grilling</a>, <a href="frying">frying</a>, <a href="saut%C3%A9eing">sautéeing</a>, or eaten raw. Mushrooms are rich in <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>s and <a href="dietary%20protein">proteins</a>, with a low <a href="fat">fat</a> content.

The species was described as new to science in 1774 by <a href="Jacob%20Christian%20Schaeffer">Jacob Christian Schaeffer</a>. Its distribution encompasses Asia, North Africa, Europe, and Central America. Its presence in North America has not been clarified, due to confusion with the similar species "<a href="Russula%20parvovirescens">Russula parvovirescens</a>" and "<a href="Russula%20crustosa">R. crustosa</a>". "R. virescens" fruits singly or scattered on the ground in both <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> and <a href="mixed%20forest">mixed forest</a>s, forming <a href="mycorrhiza">mycorrhiza</a>l associations with broadleaf trees such as <a href="oak">oak</a>, <a href="Fagus%20sylvatica">European beech</a>, and <a href="aspen">aspen</a>. In Asia, it associates with several species of tropical lowland <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a> trees of the family <a href="Dipterocarpaceae">Dipterocarpaceae</a>. "R. virescens" has a <a href="ribonuclease">ribonuclease</a> enzyme with a <a href="biochemistry">biochemistry</a> unique among edible mushrooms. It also has <a href="biological%20activity">biologically active</a> <a href="polysaccharide">polysaccharide</a>s, and a <a href="laccase">laccase</a> enzyme that can break down several <a href="dye">dye</a>s used in the laboratory and in the <a href="textile%20industry">textile industry</a>.

"Russula virescens" was first described by German <a href="polymath">polymath</a> <a href="Jacob%20Christian%20Schaeffer">Jacob Christian Schaeffer</a> in 1774 as "Agaricus virescens". The species was subsequently transferred to the genus "Russula" by <a href="Elias%20Magnus%20Fries">Elias Fries</a> in 1836. According to the <a href="Scientific%20nomenclature">nomenclatural</a> authority <a href="MycoBank">MycoBank</a>, "Russula furcata" var. "aeruginosa" (published by <a href="Christian%20Hendrik%20Persoon">Christian Hendrik Persoon</a> in 1796) and "Agaricus caseosus" (published by <a href="Karl%20Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20Wallroth">Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Wallroth</a> in 1883) are <a href="synonym%20%28biology%29">synonyms</a> of "Russula virescens". The <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a> "albidocitrina", defined by <a href="Claude%20Casimir%20Gillet">Claude Casimir Gillet</a> in 1876, is no longer considered to have independent <a href="taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> significance. According to <a href="Rolf%20Singer">Rolf Singer</a>'s 1986 <a href="classification%20%28biology%29">classification</a> of "Russula", "R. virescens" is the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of <a href="Subsection%20%28botany%29">subsection</a> "Virescentinae" in section "Rigidae", a grouping of mushrooms characterized by a cap surface that breaks into patches of bran-like (furfuraceous) particles. In a <a href="molecular%20phylogenetic">molecular phylogenetic</a> analysis of European "Russula", "R. virescens" formed a <a href="clade">clade</a> with "<a href="Russula%20mustelina">R. mustelina</a>"; these two species were <a href="sister%20group">sister</a> to a clade containing "<a href="Russula%20amoenicolor">R. amoenicolor</a>" and "<a href="Russula%20violeipes">R. violeipes</a>".

The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> "virescens" is <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "becoming green". The characteristic pattern of the cap surface has earned the species <a href="common%20name">common name</a>s such as the green-cracking russula, the quilted green russula, and the green brittlegill. In the <a href="mid-Atlantic%20United%20States">mid-Atlantic United States</a>, it is also known locally as the moldy russula.

Described by mushroom enthusiast <a href="Antonio%20Carluccio">Antonio Carluccio</a> as "not exactly nice to look at", the <a href="Pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> is at first dome or barrel-shaped, becoming convex and flattened with age with a diameter of up to . The cap center is often depressed. The <a href="pileipellis">cuticle</a> of the cap is green, most profoundly in the center, with patches of the same color dispersed radially around the center in an <a href="wikt%3Aareolate">areolate</a> pattern. The color of the cuticle is often of variable shade, ranging from gray to <a href="verdigris">verdigris</a> to grass-green. The extent of the patching of the cuticle is also variable, giving specimens with limited patches a resemblance to other green-capped species of "Russula", such as "<a href="Russula%20aeruginea">R. aeruginea</a>". The green patches of the cap lie on a white to pale green background. The cap, while frequently round, may also exhibit irregular lobes and cracks. The cap cuticle is thin, and can be readily peeled off the surface to a distance of about halfway towards the cap center.
The <a href="Lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> are white to cream colored, and fairly crowded together; they are mostly free from attachment to the <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a>. Gills are interconnected at their bases by veins. The stipe is cylindrical, white, and of variable height, up to tall and wide; it is roughly the same thickness at both the top and the base. The top portion of the stipe may be farinose—covered with a white, mealy powder. It may turn slightly brown with age, or when it is injured or bruised from handling. Like other mushrooms in the <a href="Russulales">Russulales</a>, the <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is brittle, owing to the sphaerocyst cytoarchitecture—cylindrical cells that contrast with the typical fibrous, filamentous <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e present in other orders of the <a href="basidiomycota">basidiomycota</a>.

The <a href="basidiospore">spores</a> of "R. virescens" are elliptical or <a href="ellipsoid">ellipsoid</a> with warts, translucent (<a href="hyaline">hyaline</a>), and produce a white, pale or pale yellow <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a>; the spore dimensions are 6–9 by 5–7 <a href="micrometre">µm</a>. A partial reticulum (net-like pattern of ridges) interconnects the warts. The spore-bearing cells, the <a href="basidia">basidia</a>, are club-shaped and have dimensions of 24–33 by 6–7.5 µm; they are colorless, and each hold from two to four spores. The pleurocystidia (<a href="cystidia">cystidia</a> on the gill face) are 40–85 by 6–8 µm and end abruptly in a sharp point.

"Russula parvovirescens", found in the eastern United States, can be distinguished from "R. virescens" by its smaller stature, with caps measuring wide and stipe up to long by thick. Compared to "R. virescens", it tends to be more bluish-green, the patches on its cap are larger, and it has a lined cap margin. Microscopically, the terminal cells in the cap cuticle of "R. parvovirescens" are more swollen than those of "R. virescens", which has tapered and elongated terminal cells. Another green-capped "Russula" is "<a href="Russula%20aeruginea">R. aeruginea</a>", but this species may be distinguished from "R. virescens" by its smaller size and smooth cap. Other green russulas with a smooth cap include "<a href="Russula%20heterophylla">R. heterophylla</a>" and <a href="Russula%20cyanoxantha">"R. cyanoxantha" var. "peltereaui"</a>. "<a href="Russula%20crustosa">Russula crustosa</a>", like "R. virescens", also has an areolate cap, but the cap becomes sticky (viscid) when moist, and its color is more variable, as it may be reddish, yellowish, or brown. Also, the spore print of "R. crustosa" is a darker yellow than "R. virescens". "<a href="Russula%20redolens">R. redolens</a>" has a cap that is "drab-green to blue-green", but unlike "R. virescens", is smooth. "R. redolens" has an unpleasant taste and smells of <a href="parsley">parsley</a>.

"Russula virescens" is an <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible mushroom</a> considered to be one of the best of the genus "Russula", and is popular in Europe, particularly in Spain. In an 1875 work on the uses of fungi, English <a href="mycology">mycologist</a> <a href="Mordecai%20Cubitt%20Cooke">Mordecai Cubitt Cooke</a> remarked about the mushroom that "the peasants about Milan are in the habit of putting [it] over wood embers to toast, and eating [it] afterwards with a little salt." The mushroom is often sold as a dried product in Asia, and in China, it can be found in roadside markets. Its smell is not distinctive, but its taste has been described as mild, nutty, fruity, or even sweet. Old specimens may smell of <a href="herring">herring</a>s. Drying the mushrooms enhances the nutty flavor. Mushrooms can be <a href="Saut%C3%A9ing">sautéed</a> (the green color disappears with cooking), and young specimens that are prepared this way have a potato taste that pairs well with <a href="shallot">shallot</a>s. They are also fried or grilled, or used raw in salads. Young specimens are pale and can be hard to identify, but the characteristic pattern of older fruit bodies makes them hard to confuse with other species. When collecting "R. virescens" for consumption, caution is of vital importance to avoid confusion with the dangerously poisonous "<a href="Amanita%20phalloides">Amanita phalloides</a>" (known as the <a href="death%20cap">death cap</a>), a mushroom that can be most easily identified by its <a href="volva%20%28mycology%29">volva</a> and <a href="annulus%20%28mycology%29">ring</a>.

The nutritional components of "R. virescens" mushrooms have been characterized. Fresh mushrooms contain about 92.5% moisture. A sample of dried mushroom (100 g dw) has 365 <a href="calorie">kcal</a> (1527 <a href="kilojoules">kilojoules</a>). <a href="Carbohydrate">Carbohydrate</a>s make up the bulk of the fruit bodies, comprising 62% of the dry weight; 11.1% of the carbohydrates are <a href="sugar">sugar</a>s, the large majority of which (10.9%) is <a href="mannitol">mannitol</a>. The total <a href="lipid">lipid</a>, or crude fat, content makes up 1.85% of the dry matter of the mushroom. The proportion of <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a>s (expressed as a percentage of total fatty acids) are 28.78% <a href="saturated%20fat">saturated</a>, 41.51% <a href="monounsaturated%20fat">monounsaturated</a>, and 29.71% <a href="polyunsaturated%20fatty%20acid">polyunsaturated</a>. The most prevalent fatty acids include: <a href="palmitic%20acid">palmitic acid</a>, 17.3% of total fatty acids; <a href="stearic%20acid">stearic acid</a>, 7.16%; <a href="oleic%20acid">oleic acid</a>, 40.27%; and <a href="linoleic%20acid">linoleic acid</a>, 29.18%. Several <a href="biological%20activity">bioactive</a> compounds are present in the mushroom. One hundred grams (dry weight) contains 49.3 <a href="microgram">microgram</a>s (µg) of <a href="tocopherol">tocopherol</a>s (20.0 µg <a href="alpha-Tocopherol">alpha</a>, 21.3 µg <a href="beta-Tocopherol">beta</a>, and 8.0 µg <a href="gamma-Tocopherol">gamma</a>) and 0.19 milligrams (mg) of the <a href="carotenoid">carotenoid</a> pigment <a href="lycopene">lycopene</a>. There are 4.46 g of <a href="organic%20acid">organic acid</a>s per 100 g of dry mushrooms, including <a href="oxalic%20acid">oxalic acid</a> (0.78 g), <a href="malic%20acid">malic acid</a> (2.71 g), <a href="citric%20acid">citric acid</a> (0.55 g), and <a href="fumaric%20acid">fumaric acid</a> (0.23 g). Mushrooms have 22.6 mg/100 g dw of the <a href="phenols">phenolic</a> compound <a href="4-hydroxybenzoic%20acid">4-hydroxybenzoic acid</a>, and 15.8 mg/100 g dw of <a href="cinnamic%20acid">cinnamic acid</a>.

"Russula virescens" can be found fruiting on soil in both <a href="Temperate%20deciduous%20forest">deciduous forests</a> and <a href="mixed%20forest">mixed forest</a>s, forming <a href="ectomycorrhiza">ectomycorrhiza</a>l <a href="symbiosis">symbiotic</a> relationships with a variety of trees, including oaks ("<a href="Quercus">Quercus</a>"), European beech ("<a href="Fagus%20sylvatica">Fagus sylvatica</a>"), and aspen ("<a href="Populus%20tremula">Populus tremula</a>"). Preliminary investigations suggest that the fungus also associates with at least ten species of <a href="Dipterocarpaceae">Dipterocarpaceae</a>, an important tree family prevalent in the tropical lowland forests of <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>. Fruit bodies may appear singly or in groups, reappear in the same spots year after year, and are not common. In Europe, fruiting occurs mainly during the months of summer to early autumn. A Mexican study of the seasonal occurrence of several common mushroom species in <a href="subtropical">subtropical</a> forests in <a href="Xalapa">Xalapa</a> showed that the fruiting period of "R. virescens" occurred in April, before the onset of the <a href="Wet%20season">rainy season</a>.

The distribution of "R. virescens" in North America is subject to debate, where a number of similar species such as "<a href="Russula%20parvovirescens">R. parvovirescens</a>" and "<a href="Russula%20crustosa">R. crustosa</a>" are also recognized. One author even suggests that "R. virescens" "is strictly a European species", citing Buyck and collaborators (2006), who say "the "virescens"-"crustosa" group is much more complex than suspected and embraces at least a dozen taxa in the eastern US". As in Europe, "Russula virescens" has a widespread distribution in Asia, having been recorded from India, Malaysia, Korea, the Philippines, Nepal, China, Thailand, and Vietnam. It is also found in North Africa and Central America.

"Russula virescens" has a limited capacity to <a href="bioaccumulation">bioaccumulate</a> the <a href="micronutrient">micronutrient</a>s <a href="iron">iron</a>, <a href="copper">copper</a>, and <a href="zinc">zinc</a> from the soil. The concentration of these trace metals is slightly higher in the caps than the stipes. A meal of fresh mushroom caps would supply 16% of the <a href="recommended%20daily%20allowance">recommended daily allowance</a> (RDA) of copper for an adult male or female (ages 19–50); 16% or 7.3% of the RDA of iron for an adult male or female, respectively; and 16–22% of the adult RDA of zinc. The mushroom is a poor bioaccumulator of the toxic <a href="heavy%20metal%20%28chemistry%29">heavy metals</a> <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a>, <a href="cadmium">cadmium</a>, <a href="lead">lead</a>, <a href="mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a>, and <a href="nickel">nickel</a>.

<a href="Biological%20activity">Biologically active</a> mushroom <a href="polysaccharide">polysaccharide</a>s have been a frequent research topic in recent decades due to their possible stimulatory effect on <a href="innate%20immune%20system">innate</a> and <a href="cell-mediated%20immunity">cell-mediated</a> immune responses, antitumor activities, and other activities. Immunostimulatory activity, <a href="antioxidant">antioxidant</a> activity, <a href="cholesterol">cholesterol</a>-lowering, and <a href="blood%20sugar">blood sugar</a>-lowering effects have been detected in extracts of "R. virescens" fruit bodies, which are attributed to polysaccharides. A water-insoluble <a href="beta-glucan">beta-glucan</a>, RVS3-II, has been isolated from the fruit bodies. <a href="Sulfation">Sulfated</a> <a href="derivative%20%28chemistry%29">derivatives</a> of this compound have antitumor activities against <a href="sarcoma">sarcoma</a> tumor <a href="cell%20line">cell line</a>s. RVP, a water-soluble polysaccharide present in the mushroom, is made largely of <a href="galactomannan">galactomannan</a> subunits and has antioxidant activity.

<a href="Ribonuclease">Ribonuclease</a>s (or RNases) are <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s that <a href="enzyme%20catalysis">catalyze</a> the <a href="hydrolysis">hydrolysis</a> of <a href="ribonucleic%20acid">ribonucleic acid</a> (RNA), and collectively they play a critical role in many biological processes. A RNase from "R. virescens" was shown to be biochemically unique amongst seven edible mushroom species in several ways: it has a co-<a href="Specificity%20%28biochemistry%29%23Specificity">specificity</a> towards cleaving RNA at poly <a href="adenine">A</a> and poly <a href="cytosine">C</a>, compared to the monospecific RNases of the others; it can be <a href="adsorption">adsorbed</a> on <a href="column%20chromatography">chromatography</a> columns containing <a href="Diethylaminoethyl%20cellulose">DEAE–cellulose</a> as the adsorbent; it has a <a href="pH">pH</a> optimum of 4.5, lower than all other species; and, it has a "distinctly different" <a href="N-terminal">N-terminal</a> <a href="amino%20acid%20sequence">amino acid sequence</a>.

Iridion 3D

Iridion 3D is a quasi-<a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D</a> <a href="Shoot%20%27em%20up%23Tube%20and%20rail%20shooters">rail shooter</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> developed by <a href="Shin%27en">Shin'en</a>. A <a href="launch%20title">launch title</a> for the <a href="Game%20Boy%20Advance">Game Boy Advance</a> portable game console, it was released in North America on June 11, 2001 and in Europe on September 21 the same year. Influenced by the <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore 64</a> game "<a href="Uridium">Uridium</a>", the game features a single <a href="starship">starship</a> fighting the alien Iridion, who have attacked Earth. "Iridion" spans seven levels from Earth to the aliens' home planet, each with a fixed linear path that ends with a <a href="boss%20%28video%20games%29">boss</a>.

"Iridion" began development as a shooter for the <a href="Game%20Boy%20Color">Game Boy Color</a>; when Shin'en decided to drop development and shift their focus to the Game Boy Advance, "Iridion" was the first game by the developer to appear on the system. Though billed as a 3D game, Shin'en used realtime encoding and resizing to manipulate the size of 2D sprites instead of creating a <a href="true%203D">true 3D</a> environment. More room on the game cartridge was available for graphics due to the game's use of the GAX Sound Engine, which allowed real-time decoding of song data in a small file size.

On release "Iridion" garnered generally poor reviews. The graphics and sound were generally praised; even a year after its release, critics at <a href="TechTV">TechTV</a> considered it the best-looking game on the platform. In contrast, critics derided the game's repetitive and frustrating gameplay. Despite lukewarm reception to the title upon release, "Iridion 3D" influenced future Shin'en shooters such as "<a href="Iridion%20II">Iridion II</a>" and "<a href="Nanostray">Nanostray</a>".

The game is a simple forward-scrolling <a href="Shoot%20%27em%20up%23Tube%20and%20rail%20shooters">rail shooter</a>, similar to the <a href="Star%20Fox%20%28series%29">"Star Fox" series</a>. Only the Game Boy Advance's <a href="directional%20pad">directional pad</a>, A, and Start buttons are used during gameplay. The ship remains locked at a set speed and cannot brake or speed up.

The player encounters more than fifteen types of enemy, not including level bosses. Some are easy to destroy; others, including the fire creatures found on the Iridion home world, are indestructible and must be avoided. Other enemies prevent the player from dodging enemy fire by laying mines to block paths. Passive objects, such as garbage or <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a>s, can damage or destroy the player's craft. Enemies vary in armor and weaponry—some cannot return fire but travel in waves to ram the player.

Each level has the player follow a linear path through waves of enemies and culminates with a <a href="boss%20%28video%20games%29">boss</a>. In boss stages the player's craft does not move forward, but hovers in front of the boss. Each boss has a single vulnerability which flashes when hit. These areas are often heavily shielded and must be hit repeatedly to remove armor. Other bosses' vulnerabilities are hidden and appear for only short periods. Most bosses have weapons that fire upon the player or reflect the player's shots. At the end of each level, players receive bonuses for defeated enemies, lives remaining, and the energy level of the player's craft. An <a href="1-up">extra life</a> is granted if the score reaches certain thresholds.

"Iridion 3D" features five types of weapons, with three levels of power each. Players boost weapon power by collecting <a href="Power-up">powerups</a> of the color that matches the current weapon. Collecting a different color gives the player the first level of that weapon type. If the player's ship is destroyed the power level of the weapon is reduced by one. Each weapon has advantages and disadvantages. The player starts with the red weapon, which is relatively weak but fires rapidly in a large spread. Green weapons are inaccurate but fill the screen with shots. Purple weapons spin in a counterclockwise motion slowly and are fairly strong. Yellow <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>-like weapons are very powerful but powerups are rare and the weapon fires slowly. Blue weapons, a more powerful version of Yellow weapons, are found only on the last level. Flashing powerups restore the craft's shields.

In the opening cinematic of "Iridion 3D" Earth is attacked without warning by the Iridion, who take over much of the surface and lay mines in orbit and bombs in the Pacific Ocean. The player is the pilot of an experimental SHN fighter, the last hope for defending Earth from the Iridion. The player pilots his ship alone against hordes of Iridion fighters and natural obstacles. The early stages begin on Earth, with the player fighting through an Iridion garbage tunnel. The player proceeds to the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> and destroys much of the Iridion invasion fleet on Earth before heading into the <a href="stratosphere">stratosphere</a> to destroy the orbital blockade around Earth and subsequently annihilating the Iridion boss at the Moon.

With the invasion fleet in ruins, the player heads into the far reaches of space. After destroying an Iridion mining colony within an <a href="asteroid%20belt">asteroid belt</a>, the player proceeds into the Iridion home system. Eventually the player fights the Iridion on their home world, destroying the Iridion "mainframe" and ending the alien threat forever.

"Iridion" started development as a shooter for the <a href="Game%20Boy%20Color">Game Boy Color</a>; on January 10, 2001, Shin'en announced they would stop making games for the Color, instead working on games exclusively for the Game Boy Advance. "Iridion"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s executive producer was Dan Kitchen, a former programmer for <a href="Atari">Atari</a>. "Iridion 3D" was Shin'en's first product to utilize the GAX Sound Engine, which allowed <a href="real-time%20computing">real-time</a> decoding of song data in an extremely small file size; this allowed more space on the cartridge to be used for graphics.

Although advertised as a <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D</a> game, "Iridion 3D" uses solely <a href="2D%20computer%20graphics">2D graphics</a> for texture scrolling and <a href="Sprite%20%28computer%20graphics%29">sprites</a> which depict explosions and enemies. The developers create the illusion of 3D by looping background textures—a graphically intensive technique for the Game Boy Advance. Graphical objects shrink or enlarge to depict position relative to the player. Level environments feature changes such as progression from day to night. Kitchen, Majesco's <a href="vice%20president">vice president</a> of handhelds, wrote that "by pushing the graphics hardware of the Game Boy Advance to its technical limits, "Iridion 3D" provides a truly realistic 3D gaming experience." He hoped that "players will be amazed that such smooth environments and intense gameplay can now be achieved on a portable system."

By March 2001, the GBA version of "Iridion" was shown in workable form. <a href="IGN">IGN</a> saw early screens and declared that "Iridion" was "aiming to set the standard [of what GBA shooters should be]... Set the standard with a hail of bullets." They felt Shin'en was pushing the Game Boy Advance to its limits, producing the most stunning game seen at the time for the handheld system. <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>'s Ben Stahl previewed "Iridion 3D" on March 21, 2001, shortly before the release of the game in the United States. He noted the excellent graphics and high <a href="frame%20rate">frame rate</a>, ending with "At this point, "Iridion 3D" looks like it could be a great game for fans of the genre."

Despite praise for its graphics and sound, "Iridion 3D" was received mixed reviews from critics; the game received 53% and 57% ratings on review aggregate web sites <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> and <a href="GameRankings">GameRankings</a>, respectively.

The graphics were almost universally praised. Andrew Bub of <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a> asserted that Nintendo should have used "Iridion" to advertise the Game Boy Advance, as it took full advantage of the system's power. A year after its release, <a href="TechTV">TechTV</a>'s Miguel Concepcion argued it was still the best-looking game for the system. Miguel Lopez of <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> lauded the graphics, writing that "while it's ultimately all smoke and mirrors, "Iridion"s world is richly detailed, has remarkable depth, and is unbelievably fluid. It's often hard to tell if the game's backgrounds are composed of streaming <a href="full%20motion%20video">full motion video</a> or just some really fancy math-powered 2D bitmaps."

In contrast to praise for "Iridion"s graphics, its actual gameplay was generally panned. <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Craig Harris wrote that "Shin'en's shooter for the Game Boy Advance will impress with all its effects, but that's about it." He noted that the player is limited to shooting and dodging, making gameplay repetitive. Harris and Concepcion complained that on a small screen distances are hard to judge; the player's ship is hit by bullets that appear to be in the distance. Bub and "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>"s Jay Fitzloff criticized the craft placement, as the player's view was often obscured by their own ship. Lopez also gave "Iridion" low marks, warning that "after the initial 'wow' wears off, you'll be stuck with an empty experience." "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" observed that "Iridion" is "a sweet number that will entertain, if only for a week or so". <a href="Allgame">Allgame</a>'s Skyler Miller said "Iridion 3D" was nothing more than a <a href="technology%20demo">technology demo</a> and awarded it two out of five stars. A more positive review came from <a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>, whose reviewer summed up his experience by writing that "if you're looking for some classic shooter action on your new GBA, "Iridion 3D" will fit the bill nicely without blowing you away."

Positive comments were usually directed at sound; WiredLounge.com said that "The soundtrack is an instant classic, maybe even one of the best shooter scores ever." Concepcion noted that the game's mood-fitting "high energy techno" was an oddity coming from a German game company. Despite poor reviews, Shin'en's Manfred Linzner felt that "Iridion 3D" was the best game for the Game Boy Advance without licensed characters.

The Playboy

The Playboy is a <a href="graphic%20novel">graphic novel</a> by Canadian cartoonist <a href="Chester%20Brown">Chester Brown</a>, serialized in 1990 in Brown's comic book "<a href="Yummy%20Fur%20%28comics%29">Yummy Fur</a>" and collected in different revised book editions in 1992 and 2013. It deals with Brown's guilt and anxiety over his obsessive masturbation to "<a href="Playboy">Playboy</a>" <a href="Playboy%20Playmate">Playmate</a> models.

The story begins with Brown's first purchase of an issue of "Playboy" as a teenager. His obsessive masturbating gives him great guilt and anxiety, and out of fear of being caught he repeatedly rids himself of copies of the magazine, only to retrieve them later. His conflicting emotions follow him into adulthood until he purges them by revealing himself through his comics. The free, organic arrangement of odd-shaped panels of simple, expressive artwork contrasts with Brown's more detailed grid-like pages in his 1980s work, such as "<a href="Ed%20the%20Happy%20Clown">Ed the Happy Clown</a>".

"The Playboy" forms part of Brown's early-1990s <a href="Chester%20Brown%27s%20autobiographical%20comics">autobiographical period</a>, and was the first book-length work he planned as a complete story. Brown conceived it as a longer work with what became his next graphic novel, "<a href="I%20Never%20Liked%20You">I Never Liked You</a>" (1994), but found the larger story too complex to handle at once. The story has attracted praise for its revealing honesty and criticism from those who saw it as glorifying pornography. "Playboy" publisher <a href="Hugh%20Hefner">Hugh Hefner</a> wrote Brown to express concern over Brown's sexual anxieties in a post-<a href="sexual%20revolution">sexual revolution</a> world.

<a href="Chester%20Brown">Chester Brown</a> grew up in <a href="Ch%C3%A2teauguay">Châteauguay</a>, a Montreal suburb with a large English-speaking minority; he does not speak French. He described himself as a "nerdy teenager" attracted to <a href="comic%20book">comic book</a>s from a young age. He sought a career drawing <a href="superhero%20comics">superhero comics</a>, but was unsuccessful in finding work with <a href="Marvel%20Comics">Marvel</a> or <a href="DC%20Comics">DC</a> after graduating from high school. He moved to Toronto and discovered and the small-press community. He began to self-publish a <a href="minicomic">minicomic</a> in 1983 titled "<a href="Yummy%20Fur%20%28comics%29">Yummy Fur</a>".

From 1986 Toronto-based <a href="Vortex%20Comics">Vortex Comics</a> began publishing "Yummy Fur". After making a name for himself in <a href="alternative%20comics">alternative comics</a> with the surreal serial "<a href="Ed%20the%20Happy%20Clown">Ed the Happy Clown</a>", Brown <a href="Chester%20Brown%27s%20autobiographical%20comics">turned to autobiography</a> after reading such work by <a href="Julie%20Doucet">Julie Doucet</a> and <a href="Joe%20Matt">Joe Matt</a>. The work of his friend and fellow Toronto cartoonist <a href="Seth%20%28cartoonist%29">Seth</a> inspired Brown to pare down his drawing style during the early 1990s. He tentatively began his autobiographical period with a pair of short tales, and gradually became freer with his panel layouts and simpler in his artwork.

The autobiographical story takes place in Chester "Chet" Brown's hometown of Châteauguay in 1975, when Brown was 15. It details his obsession with the <a href="Playboy%20Playmate">Playmates</a> in "<a href="Playboy">Playboy</a>" magazine. Brown's character obsessively masturbates in secret, terrified of being found out, but unable to resist the urge. Afterwards he feels guilty and sometimes rids himself of the magazines, only to retrieve them. As an adult, he sometimes repurchases copies of issues he had discarded.

The story takes place primarily during Brown's adolescence and finishes at the time of the book's creation. Brown uses a bat-winged figure with his own face to narrate the story and goad Chet in a way similar to the trope of the <a href="Shoulder%20angel">angel and devil on the shoulders</a>. Chet never acknowledges the narrator, who appears to be visible only to the reader. The narrator talks about Brown in the third person in the adolescent parts of the story, but in the first person in Brown's adult years.

The story opens in church, where the winged narrator cajoles the adolescent Chet to buy a "Playboy" magazine he had seen for sale. Chet works up the courage to buy it at a convenience store a considerable distance from his house, in the hope that no one will see him there.

After bringing it home and masturbating to it, he disposes of the magazine by hiding it under a plank of wood in the woods near his house. His building obsession battles his guilt, and eventually he returns for it, a situation which repeats itself throughout the story. His obsession so overcomes him that, even when his mother dies while he is at camp, his first thought at returning home is to retrieve the "Playboy" he has hidden in the woods. As an adult, he hunts down back issues and memorizes dates and names of Playmate models, and disposes of them over the guilt he feels or his fear of being found out by a girlfriend. His obsession interferes with his relations with women: he relates that, while seeing one girlfriend, he could only maintain an erection for her by fantasizing about his favourite Playmates, and that he preferred masturbation to having sex with her.

"The Playboy" finishes with Brown drawing the story in progress. Though he knows his friends shortly will read it, he still feels uncomfortable discussing it with them.

By the end of the 1980s Brown had grown dissatisfied with his drawing style. He began simplifying it after bringing "Ed the Happy Clown" to an end, as he had been reading work by cartoonists with simpler styles such as <a href="John%20Stanley%20%28cartoonist%29">John Stanley</a> and Brown's friend Seth. He abandoned the grid layout that he had used and arranged panels on the page in a varied, organic manner. He made the drawings first and only afterwards laid down panel borders, which conform to the shapes of the pictures they enclose and are in a wobbly free-hand–much like those of the <a href="Hernandez%20brothers">Hernandez brothers</a> or <a href="Robert%20Crumb">Robert Crumb</a>. Brown distorted his images to convey emotion, but not in traditional cartoonish ways. For example, when the adolescent Brown encounters friends of his parents, he does not physically shrink with embarrassment, but does so through distortion of perspective.

Chet is introverted and self-isolating, preferring pornography to communicating with others, such as his brother. Chet takes centre stage in the narrative, and supporting characters make but brief appearances.

Brown depicts Chet's obsessive masturbation, and his uncommon masturbation style has drawn notice: he faces down and rubs his penis between the palms of both hands, a style Marcy R. Isabella likens to a pair of praying hands. The style has come to be called "the Chester" after a cartoon of it by <a href="Peter%20Bagge">Peter Bagge</a>. He feels terrified of being caught masturbating and his regret afterwards drives him continually to rid himself of the magazines, such as by hiding them in the woods near his house, but always returns for them. Brown's mother dies while he is at camp, which is mentioned only briefly, as when he returns from camp he immediately heads to the woods to dig up the "Playboy" he had buried there. Comics critic Darcy Sullivan sees Brown in this scene having "shunted aside his painful feelings for her, and for other women, in favor of this tatty fetish". Chet feels surprised at and repelled by a centrefold of a black Playmate he comes across, bringing about the realization of racist feelings he has.

When finishing "The Playboy", Brown felt guilt over still looking at Playmates and credits having come out in print with helping him overcome his shame. While many have interpreted the book as a condemnation of pornography, to Brown it is about the guilt he was made to feel for using the media. Some interpretations, such as those of Sullivan and Darrel Epp, see "The Playboy" demonstrating how the idealized images in pornography distort societal norms and expectations of beauty; one example cited is a scene in which Brown says he could only maintain an erection with one girlfriend if he fantasized about his favourite Playmates. Brown has objected to this interpretation—rather, he sees it as a flaw in the work, in that it does not provide enough context for what he intended to communicate: that he had gotten into a relationship with a woman whom he did not find sexually attractive, and that if "Playboy" did not exist he would have fantasized about other images of women.

Critic Darcy Sullivan saw the book as presenting how Brown's "Playboy" obsession affects his ability to relate to women. Sullivan called "The Playboy" stories "[t]he most honest sex in comics" of the early 1990s, "and the most damning exposé of pornography" as it deals "with nothing more than Brown's relationship with "Playboy"". He praises how quickly Brown matured as a storyteller over the course of "The Playboy", and for the believability of scenes which may or may not have happened as Brown depicted them. While seeming to acknowledge <a href="Feminism">feminist</a> concerns, Brown depicts himself as "a victim of his urges", and that ""Playboy" has kept him mentally separate". Sullivan asserts the book shows that pornography does not merely satisfy a need, but fosters an addiction. Brown's comics raise questions, rather than trying to answer them, an approach Sullivan compared favourably to that of Joe Matt's less subtle body of work, which also details a pornography obsession: he wrote that Matt's comics analyze and rationalize his obsession, while Brown's reveal.

Brown had run into problems doing autobiographical stories of his contemporary life, as his story interconnected with the stories of those around him—the friends he portrayed did not always agree with the way he pictured them. He portrays his friend Kris's negative reaction in "<a href="Showing%20Helder">Showing Helder</a>" to his depiction of her in "<a href="Helder%20%28comics%29">Helder</a>". Brown turned to tales of his teenage years, as he had lost contact with most of those he knew from that time. Brown stated that he intended a longer story encompassing what ended up in "The Playboy" and the following graphic novel, "<a href="I%20Never%20Liked%20You">I Never Liked You</a>" (1994), but when planning it he found it was too complex. He said he had a clear idea of the stories from his life that he would use, and the general shape of the narrative, but he had a "sense of improvising" as he did not script it out beforehand.

The serialization appeared under the title "Disgust" in issues 21–23 of "Yummy Fur", at the time published by Vortex Comics. With the twenty-fifth issue of "Yummy Fur" in 1991, Brown switched publishers to the Montreal-based <a href="Drawn%20and%20Quarterly">Drawn and Quarterly</a>, who published a collected and revised edition of "The Playboy" in 1992; this was the first <a href="graphic%20novel">graphic novel</a> from the publisher. Brown rescripted, relettered, and reformatted the book for an annotated edition in 2013, also from Drawn and Quarterly.

The story gained praise from fans, critics, and other cartoonists, and earned a <a href="Harvey%20Award">Harvey Award</a> nomination in 1991 for Best Single Issue or Story. "The Playboy", "I Never Liked You", and several shorter pieces placed No. 38 on "<a href="The%20Comics%20Journal">The Comics Journal</a>"s list of the best 100 English-language comics of the 20th century as "The autobiographical comics from Yummy Fur". Cartoonist <a href="Gilbert%20Hernandez">Gilbert Hernandez</a> asserted, ""The Playboy" and "I Never Liked You" are probably the best graphic novels next to "<a href="Maus">Maus</a>"". Critic Frank Young called it a "pivotal work" in the autobiographical comics trend of the early 1990s. Critic Darcy Sullivan considered it required reading for those who are serious about comics and a "landmark look at an artist's growth", referring to the pace with which Brown's work matured over the course of the three issues of its serialization.

Brown stated that several women took offense at the book, saying it glorified pornography. <a href="Hugh%20Hefner">Hugh Hefner</a> sent Brown a letter after "The Playboy"s publication, showing concern that someone who grew up during the <a href="sexual%20revolution">sexual revolution</a> could still suffer such confusion and anxiety. Darcy Sullivan compared the pornography-obsessed autobiographical work of Joe Matt in "<a href="Peepshow%20%28comics%29">Peepshow</a>" unfavourably to "The Playboy" in an issue of "The Comics Journal", to which Brown responded with a defence of Matt's work in a later issue.

Brown's attitudes towards pornography have since changed greatly. When he made "The Playboy" he was struggling with his embarrassment over buying pornography; two decades later he vocally advocated for the decriminalization of prostitution in "<a href="Paying%20for%20It">Paying for It</a>" (2011).

I Never Liked You

I Never Liked You is a <a href="graphic%20novel">graphic novel</a> by Canadian cartoonist <a href="Chester%20Brown">Chester Brown</a>. The story first ran between 1991 and 1993 under the title Fuck, in issues of Brown's comic book "<a href="Yummy%20Fur%20%28comics%29">Yummy Fur</a>"; published in book form by <a href="Drawn%20and%20Quarterly">Drawn and Quarterly</a> in 1994. It deals with the teenage Brown's <a href="Extraversion%20and%20introversion">introversion</a> and difficulty talking to others, especially members of the opposite sex—including his mother, to whom he is unable to express affection even as she lies dying in the hospital. The story has minimal dialogue and is sparsely narrated. The artwork is amongst the simplest in Brown's body of work—some pages consist only of a single small panel.

Brown established his reputation in the early <a href="alternative%20comics">alternative comics</a> scene of the 1980s with the surreal, taboo-breaking "<a href="Ed%20the%20Happy%20Clown">Ed the Happy Clown</a>". He brought that story to an abrupt end in 1989 when, excited by the <a href="autobiographical%20comics">autobiographical comics</a> of <a href="Joe%20Matt">Joe Matt</a> and <a href="Julie%20Doucet">Julie Doucet</a>, he turned towards personal stories. The uncomplicated artwork of his friend and fellow Toronto cartoonist <a href="Seth%20%28cartoonist%29">Seth</a> inspired him to simplify his own. Brown intended "I Never Liked You" as part of a longer work with what became his previous book, "<a href="The%20Playboy">The Playboy</a>" (1992), but found the larger story too complex to handle at once. "I Never Liked You" was the last work of <a href="Chester%20Brown%27s%20autobiographical%20comics">Brown's early autobiographical period</a>.

"I Never Liked You" was well received, and its influence can be found in the work of cartoonists such as <a href="Jeffrey%20Brown%20%28cartoonist%29">Jeffrey Brown</a>, <a href="Ariel%20Schrag">Ariel Schrag</a> and <a href="Anders%20Nilsen%20%28cartoonist%29">Anders Nilsen</a>. The book appeared amid the early 1990s trend in autobiographical alternative comics, and Brown was one of a prominent trio of Toronto-based autobiographical cartoonists, with Seth and Joe Matt. Brown originally set the panels against black page backgrounds, which he replaced with white for an annotated "New Definitive Edition" in 2002.

Brown grew up in <a href="Ch%C3%A2teauguay">Châteauguay</a>, a <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a> suburb with a large English-speaking minority; he does not speak French. He described himself as a "nerdy teenager" attracted to <a href="comic%20book">comic book</a>s from a young age, and sought a career in <a href="superhero%20comics">superhero comics</a>, but was unsuccessful in finding work with <a href="Marvel%20Comics">Marvel</a> or <a href="DC%20Comics">DC</a> after graduating from high school. He moved to Toronto and discovered and the small-press community. From 1983 he self-published a <a href="minicomic">minicomic</a> titled "<a href="Yummy%20Fur%20%28comics%29">Yummy Fur</a>".

From 1986 Toronto-based <a href="Vortex%20Comics">Vortex Comics</a> began publishing "Yummy Fur". After making a name for himself in <a href="alternative%20comics">alternative comics</a> with the surreal serial "<a href="Ed%20the%20Happy%20Clown">Ed the Happy Clown</a>", Brown turned to autobiography under the influence of the work of <a href="Julie%20Doucet">Julie Doucet</a> and <a href="Joe%20Matt">Joe Matt</a>. During his <a href="Chester%20Brown%27s%20autobiographical%20comics">autobiographical period</a>, Brown gradually simplified his style, inspired by the example of his friend and fellow Toronto cartoonist <a href="Seth%20%28cartoonist%29">Seth</a>. He began tentatively with a pair of short tales, and gradually became freer with his panel layouts and simpler in his artwork.

Brown had switched publishers to the Montreal-based <a href="Drawn%20and%20Quarterly">Drawn and Quarterly</a> by the time he completed his first autobiographical graphic novel, "<a href="The%20Playboy">The Playboy</a>", in 1992. At first, he intended "The Playboy" and "I Never Liked You" to form one story, but found it too complex to handle when he started to plan it out. "The Playboy" deals with Brown's guilt over his teenage obsession with masturbating over pornography. The book gained praise from fans, critics, and other cartoonists, and won a <a href="Harvey%20Award">Harvey Award</a>. It received criticism from those who saw it as objectifying women and glorifying pornography; "<a href="Playboy">Playboy</a>" publisher <a href="Hugh%20Hefner">Hugh Hefner</a> wrote to Brown voicing concern that Brown would feel such guilt in a post-<a href="sexual%20revolution">sexual revolution</a> world.

The story is set during Brown's 1970s adolescence in <a href="Ch%C3%A2teauguay">Châteauguay</a>, a suburb of Montreal. Chester—"Chet" for short—is a thin, long-haired teenager who is awkward, introverted, and better able to express himself through drawing than speaking. He constantly and inexplicably turns away girls, even though he is interested in them and they in him. Except in his imagination, Chet has difficulty expressing affection even for his mother. She talks to Chet and his younger brother Gord about issues that embarrass them, and the religious teaching she has instilled in them has rendered Chet unable to bring himself to swear, for which he is teased and goaded at school.

Chet plays games such as hide-and-seek with the neighbourhood children. One girl, Carrie, has a crush on Chet and invites him to her house each day to wash the dishes. He and Carrie's older sister Connie, a bossy blonde a year his senior, often hide during hide-and-seek games in tall grass where they spend the time talking with each other, though they have little in common. Connie asks him to the movies, but he sits away from her when he spots boys from his school; he fears he will be teased for being on a date. When the film ends, they walk home in silence.

Chet is interested in Sky, a large-breasted dark-haired girl two years younger who lives next door, about whom he has masturbatory fantasies. He confesses his love but immediately regrets it, unable to express his feelings. She connects with Chet and tries to develop a relationship, but he is unable to deal with his emotions and avoids spending time with her. He draws her a picture of a skeleton symbolizing himself reaching for a bird signifying Sky herself. When Carrie deciphers it correctly he denies that he uses symbolism in his drawings, and the confrontation escalates to minor violence when Carrie proclaims to him, "I never liked you!"

Chet and his brother rarely visit their mother after she checks into hospital, and when they do Chet cannot bring himself to tell her he loves her. She suffers a fall down a flight of stairs there when confusedly wandering around and dies after being bedridden and incoherent for a short time. Chet makes excuse after excuse to turn Sky away when she tries to spend time with him. The story ends with Chet refusing to accompany Sky to the fair because he says he would rather listen to his new <a href="Kiss%20%28band%29">Kiss</a> album.

"I Never Liked You" was originally serialized under the title "Fuck", in issues #26–30 of "Yummy Fur", between October 1991 and April 1993. Unlike his earlier works, according to Brown there was "very little improvisation in "I Never Liked You". It was quite planned out, even if I didn't write a full script."

Drawn and Quarterly issued a collected edition in 1994, changing the title from "Fuck" to "I Never Liked You". Brown rearranged the page layouts, removing panels, most significantly those in the prologue where Chet explains his motivations.

A "New Definitive Edition" appeared in 2002, with two added pages of contextual endnotes, something he had been increasingly doing from 1995 with his cartoon essay "<a href="Chester%20Brown%27s%20autobiographical%20comics%23My%20Mom%20was%20a%20Schizophrenic">My Mom Was a Schizophrenic</a>". In the 1994 collection the backgrounds were black; he changed them to white and rearranged the panels for the "New Definitive Edition". He explained: "I like austerity. The white background looks more austere to me." The edition included a short appendix for readers "wondering when and where things happened".

Brown announced in "<a href="Louis%20Riel%20%28comics%29">Louis Riel</a>" 7 a recall of the first 600 copies of the edition, citing that the paper it was printed on was too transparent. The recalled copies also had a panel captioned "I decide to say nothing"; the caption did not appear in copies that were not recalled.

Academic Charles Hatfield finds "an abiding interest in the ways people are shaped by their environment" in Brown's autobiographical work, and believes the stories demonstrate "the urgency of <a href="Justin%20Green%20%28cartoonist%29">Justin Green</a> and the mundane particularity of <a href="Harvey%20Pekar">Harvey Pekar</a>", two influential creators known for their revealing autobiographical comics. Brown is unsparing in his depictions of social awkwardness of his teenage years. Despite the 1970s adolescent backdrop, sex and drugs are absent; his life is shaped by his strictly religious parents and introversion.

Brown's mother (1923–76) suffered from schizophrenia. This is not made explicit, but hinted at in scenes where she approaches awkward subjects with Chet and his brother Gord; the boys' unsupportive responses feed the discomfort. Brown addresses his mother's mental health in his 1995 cartoon essay "<a href="My%20Mom%20Was%20a%20Schizophrenic">My Mom Was a Schizophrenic</a>", in which he takes an <a href="Anti-psychiatry">anti-psychiatric</a> stance.

Chet's face is near expressionless throughout. The characters are distanced from the reader, inviting neither empathy nor <a href="Identification%20%28psychology%29">identification</a>. To cartoonist and critic Pepo Pérez, this is a challenge to readers to understand the characters. In the appendix to the "New Definitive Edition", Brown declares the dialogue is filtered through his memory and likely did not occur as recorded, and that locations and other details are also subject to lapses of memory. To academic Elisabeth El Refaie this transparency on Brown's part is "a deeper and more sincere form of authenticity". Reviewer C. Max Magee found the tone of awkwardness and emotional emptiness comparable to works by contemporaries such as <a href="Daniel%20Clowes">Daniel Clowes</a> and <a href="Chris%20Ware">Chris Ware</a>.

The story unfolds in vignettes, with little setup or context given to any scene. To Hatfield, they "[pop] out of nowhere as a dreamlike series of pulses ... The effect is sometimes eerie ... despite the grounding of the story in mundane everyday stuff." Unlike in his previous graphic novel, "<a href="The%20Playboy">The Playboy</a>", Brown makes limited use of a narrator in "I Never Liked You". The story is told almost entirely through its pictures and sparse dialogue. The page layouts are also sparse, sometimes limited to a single, small panel on a page, sometimes up to seven or eight. The layout and repetition of panels affects pacing, slowing or quickening scene.

Brown abandoned the grid layout he had used in earlier works for more varied, organic layouts. Backgrounds establish the mood of a scene, harmonizing or contrasting with the action—as when Chet and Connie return from the movies amongst a romantic snow-covered, starry landscape, against an awkward silence accentuated by panel that grow, making the figures appear ever more insignificant.

The cartooning is far looser than in Brown's earlier work, and concerned more with gesture and expression than literal detail. They are rendered with a brush, and amongst the simplest and sparsest in his body of work. There is nonetheless a significant amount of <a href="hatching">hatching</a>, and the backgrounds are naturalistic, in contrast to the thin, distorted figures. Brown had been paring his artwork since the "Playboy" stories, as he was not happy with his style and sought "to rebuild style in a way that would like". He continued this with "I Never Liked You", where he has said he was "trying to get even more pared down than "The Playboy"". Certain inanimate objects receive a focus imbuing them with special significance, such as Chet's habitual after-school package of soda crackers or the Brown family home—a house that, to reviewer Darcy Sullivan, "is as much a character as in "The Playboy"".

Brown drew the pictures before laying down the panel borders, which conform to the shapes of the pictures they enclosed and are drawn in a wobbly free-hand much like in the artwork of the <a href="Hernandez%20brothers">Los Bros Hernandez</a> or <a href="Robert%20Crumb">Robert Crumb</a>. He drew each panel individually, assembling them into pages afterwards. In the original serialization and first collected edition, they were placed on black backgrounds. He changed to white backgrounds for the 2002 edition.

<a href="Chester%20Brown%27s%20autobiographical%20comics">Brown's autobiographical work</a> developed from a scene that had been developing since the 1970s and which had reached a peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Brown's open and self-deprecating example left an impact on cartoonists such as <a href="Jeffrey%20Brown%20%28cartoonist%29">Jeffrey Brown</a> and <a href="Ariel%20Schrag">Ariel Schrag</a>, and his sparse layouts on the likes of <a href="Anders%20Nilsen%20%28cartoonist%29">Anders Nilsen</a>. Upon the serial's conclusion, reviewer Darcy Sullivan called it "a major step forward for the artist, a leading light in adult comics". American cartoonist <a href="Gilbert%20Hernandez">Gilbert Hernandez</a> hailed "The Playboy" and "I Never Liked You" as "probably the best graphic novels next to "<a href="Maus">Maus</a>""; British cartoonist <a href="Eddie%20Campbell">Eddie Campbell</a> called them "the most sensitive comics ever made"; and American comics writer <a href="Heidi%20MacDonald">Heidi MacDonald</a> called "I Never Liked You" "a masterpiece" that is "the equal of any 'coming of age' movie".

Charles Hatfield praised Brown's honesty, keen observation, and narrative strength, and called the "hide with me" page as one of his favourites. Critic described the work as "an example of sobriety and restraint, and one of the harshest, most hopeless teenage portraits ... in any medium". Scripter and critic wrote the book demonstrates Brown a master of his medium. Norwegian cartoonist <a href="Jason%20%28comics%29">Jason</a> calls "I Never Liked You" a favourite autobiographical work.

Alongside Seth's "<a href="It%27s%20a%20Good%20Life%2C%20If%20You%20Don%27t%20Weaken">It's a Good Life, If You Don't Weaken</a>" and Joe Matt's "<a href="The%20Poor%20Bastard">The Poor Bastard</a>"—works by Brown's Toronto-based friends and Drawn and Quarterly stablemates—"I Never Liked You" is seen as a prominent example of the 1990s <a href="autobiographical%20comics">autobiographical comics</a> trend. As one of "The Autobiographical Stories from Yummy Fur", it ranked 38th on "<a href="The%20Comics%20Journal">The Comics Journal</a>"s list of the top 100 English-language comics of the 20th century. In 2001 Stephen Weiner included "I Never Liked You" in his book "The 101 Best Graphic Novels", recommending it to those who enjoy <a href="J.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BD.%20Salinger">J. D. Salinger</a>'s novel "<a href="The%20Catcher%20in%20the%20Rye">The Catcher in the Rye</a>".

"I Never Liked You" was the last work from his autobiographical period that started in 1990 with "Helder" in "Yummy Fur" #19. "Yummy Fur" continued for two more issues before Drawn and Quarterly publisher <a href="Chris%20Oliveros">Chris Oliveros</a> convinced Brown to publish his next serial, "<a href="Underwater%20%28comics%29">Underwater</a>", under its own title in 1994. In 2011 Brown returned to autobiography and his relations with women with the graphic novel "<a href="Paying%20for%20It">Paying for It</a>", a polemic arguing for the <a href="Prostitution%20law">decriminalization of prostitution</a>.

Jimmy McAleer

James Robert "Loafer" McAleer (July 10, 1864April 29, 1931) was an American <a href="center%20fielder">center fielder</a>, <a href="Manager%20%28baseball%29">manager</a>, and <a href="shareholder">stockholder</a> in <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> who assisted in establishing the <a href="American%20League">American League</a>. He spent most of his 13-season playing career with the <a href="Cleveland%20Spiders">Cleveland Spiders</a>, and went on to manage the <a href="Cleveland%20Blues%20%28AL%29">Cleveland Blues</a>, <a href="St.%20Louis%20Browns">St. Louis Browns</a>, and <a href="Washington%20Senators%20%281901%E2%80%9360%29">Washington Senators</a>. Shortly before his retirement, he became a major shareholder in the <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a>.

His career ended abruptly. During his brief tenure as co-owner of the Red Sox, McAleer quarreled with longtime friend and colleague <a href="Ban%20Johnson">Ban Johnson</a>, president of the American League. In the wake of this disagreement, he sold off his shares in the Red Sox and broke off his relationship with Major League Baseball.

McAleer's rift with Johnson, along with his sudden retirement, damaged his professional reputation, and he received little recognition for his contributions to baseball. Today, he is most often remembered for initiating the customary request that the <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a> throw out the first ball of the season.

<a href="McAleer">McAleer</a> was born in <a href="Youngstown%2C%20Ohio">Youngstown, Ohio</a>, an industrial center located near the border of western <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. His father, Owen McAleer, died at a young age, leaving McAleer's mother, Mary, to support three children. The family lived on the city's west side, where the McAleer children were raised to value the concept of formal education. McAleer attended local public schools and graduated from <a href="Rayen%20High%20School%20%28Youngstown%2C%20Ohio%29">Rayen High School</a>. In later years, all three of the McAleer brothers moved on to successful careers, and the oldest, <a href="Owen%20McAleer">Owen McAleer, Jr.</a>, served for a time as mayor of Los Angeles.

A "strapping six-foot 175-pound outfielder," McAleer won early recognition for his physical speed. He became involved with a Youngstown minor league baseball club in 1882, remaining with the team until 1884. In 1885, McAleer joined another minor league organization in <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a>; and in 1887, he played for a team based in <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a>. His skill as a center fielder was recognized in 1888, while he was playing for a club in <a href="Milwaukee%2C%20Wisconsin">Milwaukee, Wisconsin</a>.

Although his primary focus was organized sports, McAleer was also drawn to the field of entertainment. During one season of his minor league career, he became part-owner of the DeHaven Comedy Company, a theatrical road troupe that was organized in Youngstown. His interest in show business remained a constant, and in later years McAleer developed a strong friendship with <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> composer and performer <a href="George%20M.%20Cohan">George M. Cohan</a>.

On April 24, 1889, McAleer broke into the Major Leagues in <a href="Cleveland%2C%20Ohio">Cleveland, Ohio</a>, where he established a reputation as a graceful <a href="outfielder">outfielder</a>. In 1891, when <a href="Patsy%20Tebeau">Patsy Tebeau</a> became manager of the <a href="Cleveland%20Spiders">Cleveland Spiders</a>, the club became known for its aggressive tactics. Tebeau encouraged players to block and hold runners, while he himself openly challenged and harassed officials. In 1896, the Cleveland manager was jailed for attacking an <a href="Umpire%20%28baseball%29">umpire</a> who "decided it was too dark to continue a game". On June 27, 1896, McAleer was among several Cleveland players to be fined by a <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville</a> (Kentucky) judge for their role in the incident. Later that year, the club's notoriety prompted other <a href="National%20League">National League</a> teams to propose a boycott of Cleveland, "until the Spiders mended their ways." McAleer's periodic displays of temper were in keeping with this rowdy environment. During an August 18, 1891 game with the <a href="Cincinnati%20Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a>, Reds player <a href="Arlie%20Latham">Arlie Latham</a> tripped McAleer as he rounded third base; McAleer responded by chasing Latham around the field, while brandishing his <a href="baseball%20bat">bat</a>.

At the same time, McAleer proved a strong performer. A later newspaper account described him as an outstanding outfielder who was "blessed with excellent speed". The article noted that McAleer's skills as a sprinter helped him <a href="Stolen%20base">steal</a> 51 bases in one year and 41 in another. According to some accounts, he was "the first centerfielder to take his eyes off a fly ball, run to the spot where it fell to earth, and catch it". Less proficient as a hitter, McAleer accumulated a lifetime <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a> of .253. During his career, the league's batting (pitchers removed) average for players with the same home field was .284. On April 24, 1894, he assisted in Cleveland's 1–0 victory over Cincinnati with a <a href="Single%20%28baseball%29">single</a> in the ninth that drove home <a href="Buck%20Ewing">Buck Ewing</a>, who had <a href="Double%20%28baseball%29">doubled</a>. Along with teammates <a href="Cy%20Young">Cy Young</a>, <a href="Jesse%20Burkett">Jesse Burkett</a>, <a href="John%20Clarkson">John Clarkson</a>, and <a href="Charles%20Zimmer">Charles Zimmer</a>, McAleer also participated in the Spiders' victory over the <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a> in the 1895 <a href="Temple%20Cup">Temple Cup</a>, a post-season series between first and second-place teams of the National League. The Spiders placed second to the Orioles at the close of both the 1895 and 1896 seasons. McAleer's performance came in spite of a serious injury he received during a game held in Philadelphia on August 24, 1895, when he collided with a fence. Furthermore, he balanced his achievements in sports with a foray into politics in his hometown of Youngstown. During the summer of 1895, McAleer was promoted in the local media as a mayoral candidate, first as a <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a>, and then as an independent.

In 1898, when the Spiders' owners purchased the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Browns%20%28NL%29">St. Louis Browns</a> franchise, McAleer opted to stay in <a href="Cleveland">Cleveland</a>, taking a brief hiatus from baseball until the Cleveland Blues franchise joined the newly formed <a href="American%20League">American League</a> (AL). During his two-year absence, the Spiders lost many of their more experienced players. In 1899, the team won 20 games and lost 134, which is still <a href="Winning%20percentage">percentage-wise</a> the worst season record in Major League history. As <a href="Sabermetrics">baseball historian</a> <a href="Bill%20James">Bill James</a> noted, the Spiders were forced to cancel home games due to poor attendance and "turned the last two months of the season into a long road trip". After a full year out of baseball in 1899, McAleer was back in a Cleveland uniform in 1900, in a new league, as player-manager of the <a href="Cleveland%20Lake%20Shores">Cleveland Lake Shores</a> of the fledgling American League, then a minor league. McAleer's subsequent career as a major league manager (1901–11) overlapped with his playing career (1882–1907). Although he did not play professionally between 1903 and 1906, McAleer played in his last Major League game on July 8, 1907.

In 1900, McAleer became <a href="player-manager">player-manager</a> of the <a href="Cleveland%20Lake%20Shores">Cleveland Lake Shores</a> (a predecessor of the <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a>) and continued with the franchise in 1901, when the American League became a major league and the club was renamed as the Blues, a name borrowed from a team that had participated in the National League during the 1870s and 1880s. The Blues made their major league debut on April 24, 1901, with an 8–2 loss to the <a href="Chicago%20White%20Sox">Chicago White Sox</a>. Two other league games were canceled due to inclement weather, and the contest between the Blues and White Sox served as the inaugural game of the AL.

In July of that year, McAleer presided over the Blues' upset 6–1 loss to the <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a>. Although the Tigers' manager, Tommy Burns, agreed to forfeit the game for fear that the umpire, <a href="Joe%20Cantillon">Joe Cantillon</a>, would be injured by an angry crowd, McAleer agreed to play the Tigers using a reserve umpire. The Blues eventually closed the season with a 54–82 record, placing seventh in the eight-team American League.

McAleer, however, contributed little to this outcome. In 1901, he played in only three games with the Blues. The AL, established in 1900 by Ban Johnson, former president of the <a href="Western%20League%20%28original%29">Western League</a>, was by this time in direct competition with the well-established <a href="National%20League">National League</a> (NL). McAleer, a close friend of Johnson and his associate, <a href="Charles%20Comiskey">Charles Comiskey</a>, played a significant role in the new league's development, recruiting scores of experienced players from the NL.

As manager of the Browns, McAleer lured players such as Hall of Famers Jesse Burkett and <a href="Bobby%20Wallace%20%28baseball%29">Bobby Wallace</a>. In 1902, the Browns took second place in the league, with a record of 78 wins and 58 losses. Between 1903 and 1907, however, the team never ranked higher than fifth or sixth place in the AL. Then, in 1908, the club rebounded, finishing just six-and-a-half games out of first place, with a record of 83 wins and 69 losses, landing at fourth in the AL. The Browns ended the 1909 season, however, with a record of 61–89, earning seventh place. McAleer was fired at the close of the season. Browns owner Robert L. Hedges, a <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a> carriage maker, replaced the "affable" McAleer with the "crustier" <a href="Jack%20O%27Connor%20%28catcher%29">Jack O'Connor</a>, who was expelled from the league in 1910 for seeking to influence the outcome of the annual batting championship.

On September 22, 1909, McAleer went on to manage the Washington Senators (popularly known as the "Nationals"), a team that had ceased to be competitive since the death of star hitter <a href="Ed%20Delahanty">Ed Delahanty</a> six years earlier. The team fared little better under McAleer's management, finishing with a lackluster 66–85 record (seventh place) at the close of the 1910 season. The high point of the season was a game in which McAleer initiated what became a baseball tradition. On April 14, 1910, he asked visiting President <a href="William%20Howard%20Taft">William Howard Taft</a> to throw out the first ball of a season opener. President Taft, an ardent fan of the game, readily agreed. Baseball historians Donald Dewey and Nicholas Acocella noted that the game "almost put an end to the career" of U.S. Vice President <a href="James%20S.%20Sherman">James S. Sherman</a>, who "took a foul ball off the bat of <a href="Home%20Run%20Baker">Frank Baker</a> directly in the head". This contest also featured a one-hit performance by pitcher <a href="Walter%20Johnson">Walter Johnson</a>, who led the Senators to a 3–0 victory over the <a href="Philadelphia%20Athletics">Philadelphia Athletics</a>.

Toward the close of the 1911 season, McAleer announced his resignation as manager of the Senators. In 1912, he became a major stockholder in the Boston Red Sox, purchasing a half-interest in the team. That year, the Red Sox "cruised to the pennant with 105 victories".
By the time the Red Sox entered the sixth game of the 1912 World Series, the team had secured a 3–1 lead over the <a href="New%20York%20Giants%20%28NL%29">New York Giants</a>. (The second game of the Series ended in a tie.) Then, McAleer pressured the team's manager, <a href="Jake%20Stahl">Jake Stahl</a>, to hand the ball to unseasoned pitcher <a href="Buck%20O%27Brien">Buck O'Brien</a> for the "clincher". McAleer's recommendation was apparently part of a strategy to ensure that the seventh game of the Series would be played at Boston's new <a href="Fenway%20Park">Fenway Park</a>. Although the Red Sox's loss to the Giants (at 5–2) guaranteed that the Series would conclude in Boston, the incident created conflict between McAleer and Stahl. Subsequent press releases suggesting that Stahl would replace McAleer as club president exacerbated these tensions.

In the seventh game of the Series, the Red Sox opened Fenway Park with a 7–6 victory over the Giants. The team suffered a public relations fiasco, however, when a Red Sox shareholder sold seats at the stadium that had been reserved for the club's most ardent fans, the "Royal Rooters". Finding themselves without seats, the Royal Rooters, led by Boston Mayor <a href="John%20%26quot%3BHoney%20Fitz%26quot%3B%20Fitzgerald">John "Honey Fitz" Fitzgerald</a>, marched around the stadium in protest. A riot ensued, and in the aftermath of the disturbance, only 17,000 Boston residents showed up for the final game. Nevertheless, the Red Sox emerged as victors, with a final score of 4–3 and one tied game.

Following the Series victory over the Giants, McAleer returned to his hometown to celebrate the event. A brass band met him at Youngstown's train depot, and a parade and fireworks display were held in his honor. "<a href="The%20Vindicator">The Youngstown Daily Vindicator</a>" reported: "As the auto bearing Mr. McAleer turned into West Federal Street, hundreds of sticks of red fire were burning at Central Square, while the quiet atmosphere was occasionally punctured by the explosion of a bomb". This was the last time he would publicly greet residents of his hometown as a figure in professional baseball.

McAleer's tenure as part-owner of the Red Sox came to a swift end. On July 15, 1913, McAleer became involved in a dispute with the AL president, Ban Johnson, when McAleer forced the resignation of Red Sox manager <a href="Jake%20Stahl">Jake Stahl</a>, one of Johnson's closest friends. While McAleer claimed that he released Stahl because of a foot injury preventing Stahl from serving as a player-manager, rumors suggested that the two men had strong personal differences. Following a bitter quarrel with Johnson, McAleer sold his holdings in the Red Sox. His feud with Johnson turned out to be a lifelong affair, despite efforts taken by their mutual friend, Charles Comiskey, to smooth over the rift. While McAleer never publicly discussed the disagreement that spurred his retirement, he supposedly relayed his version of events to Frank B. Ward, a sports reporter with "The Youngstown Daily Vindicator", with the understanding that the details remain confidential until McAleer's death.

Although other sources tell a different story, Ward wrote that McAleer termed his "break" with Johnson as the result of a "betrayal" of trust. McAleer indicated that his controlling interest in the Red Sox entitled him to make all major decisions regarding the organization, Ward wrote. This view of McAleer's powers, however, was not shared by the club's manager, Stahl, the article added. To further complicate matters, Stahl's father-in-law, a <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>-based banker, was reportedly a shareholder in the Red Sox. After one particularly heated exchange between Stahl and McAleer at the close of the 1912 season, Stahl went to Chicago to confer with Johnson. The article indicated that, after this meeting, Johnson sent McAleer a "sternly worded" letter, which may have been designed to preserve his relationship with Stahl and Stahl's father-in-law. According to the article, Johnson later confided to McAleer that he owed Stahl's father-in-law money and therefore felt obliged to take Stahl's side in the dispute. McAleer, however, took the admonition from Johnson as a betrayal of their friendship, refused to accept Johnson's explanations, and promptly retired, Ward wrote. This version of events is largely corroborated by the early research of baseball historian David Fleitz.

Baseball historians Dewey and Acocella, however, described a markedly different scenario in which Johnson secretly sold off McAleer's shares while McAleer was away on a 1913 world tour with Comiskey, New York Giants manager <a href="John%20McGraw%20%28baseball%29">John McGraw</a>, and members of the Red Sox team. According to this account, McAleer's conflict with Stahl was followed up by his involvement in a feud between two pairs of players – <a href="Tris%20Speaker">Tris Speaker</a> and <a href="Smoky%20Joe%20Wood">Joe "Smoky Joe" Wood</a>, on one side, and <a href="Heinie%20Wagner">Heinie Wagner</a> and <a href="Bill%20Carrigan">Bill Carrigan</a>, on the other. The conflict had a "religious dimension" and was described in the press as "pitting <a href="Freemasonry">Masons</a> against members of the <a href="Knights%20of%20Columbus">Knights of Columbus</a>". McAleer evidently supported Wagner and Carrigan, the <a href="Roman%20Catholicism">Catholic</a> players in the dispute. These back-to-back incidents involving individuals associated with the Red Sox team "reinforced Johnson's belief that the club president was the source of all the trouble", Dewey and Acocella wrote. In his recent book, "The Irish in Baseball", David Fleitz observed that McAleer's abrupt dismissal was typical of Johnson, "who had a history of ending relationships when they no longer benefited him personally".

Relatively little is known about McAleer's private life. Research suggests that he was married three times, with his first marriage (to Hannah McAleer) taking place in the early 20th century. At some point, he married the former Anna Durbin, a native of <a href="Trenton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Trenton, New Jersey</a>. The couple had no children. According to her obituary, Anna McAleer was her husband's "constant companion" during his "active career as a baseball magnate". When the couple settled in Youngstown in 1913, she participated in charity work and joined the Altar and Rosary Society at <a href="St.%20Columba">St. Columba</a>'s Church, where she attended religious services. In 1930, Anna McAleer died suddenly at an apartment the couple shared on the north side of Youngstown. James McAleer, who discovered his wife's body after returning from a walk, was "overcome". McAleer had recently been released from a local hospital following an <a href="appendicectomy">appendicectomy</a>; he was quickly readmitted following his wife's death.

A few months later, McAleer married a Youngstown woman, Georgianna Rudge, a graduate of the <a href="Juilliard%20School%20of%20Music">Juilliard School of Music</a> who was almost 23 years her husband's junior. Ultimately, Georgianna McAleer survived her husband by more than five decades. By the time of James McAleer's second marriage, his health was in decline. He was hospitalized within a few months of the wedding.

McAleer returned to Youngstown, where he spent his last years. Active in the community, McAleer served on the city's original draft board, which had been authorized under Ohio Governor <a href="James%20M.%20Cox">James M. Cox</a> during World War I. In retirement, the former baseball manager maintained friendships with celebrities including George M. Cohan and King <a href="Alfonso%20XIII%20of%20Spain">Alfonso XIII of Spain</a>. McAleer became acquainted with the Spanish monarch during a European tour with the Red Sox in the winter of 1912–13.

His final years were marked by poor health. Several weeks before his death, McAleer was admitted to a local hospital, where his health reportedly improved. This account, however, differs from that of baseball historian David Fleitz, who suggested that McAleer had been diagnosed with cancer in the early 1930s. In any event, McAleer died suddenly on April 29, 1931, shortly after being released from the hospital. He was 66 years old. After private funeral services at Orr's funeral home, McAleer's remains were interred at Oak Hill Cemetery, on Youngstown's near south side. Apart from his widow, he left behind two brothers, J.C. McAleer of <a href="Austintown%2C%20Ohio">Austintown, Ohio</a>, and Owen McAleer of Los Angeles. Other survivors included two nephews, Captain Charlies McAleer, an officer in the <a href="U.S.%20Army">U.S. Army</a>, and James McAleer of Los Angeles.

Rumors persist that McAleer's death was the result of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. While his name is included on some lists of Major League Baseball players who committed suicide, contemporary newspaper accounts indicated that McAleer died of natural causes.

McAleer's hometown newspaper, "<a href="The%20Vindicator">The Youngstown Daily Vindicator</a>", eulogized the ex-Major Leaguer in the following terms: "Forceful and resourceful, but always retiring when there was talk of his share in the development of baseball, James R. McAleer died within a matter of weeks after the passing of Byron Bancroft Johnson, his chief partner in the forming of the American League, and the man with whom he 'broke', which break brought about his retirement".

The article praised McAleer for assisting the careers of other baseball figures. In 1905, during his tenure as manager of the St. Louis Browns, McAleer helped future <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">Hall of Fame</a> umpire <a href="Billy%20Evans">Billy Evans</a> secure a position with the American League, writing a personal letter to Johnson on Evans' behalf. Meanwhile, McAleer served as a contact for another Youngstown resident, <a href="John%20D.%20Reese">John "Bonesetter" Reese</a>, the <a href="Welsh%20people">Welsh</a>-born "baseball doctor" who worked with players such as <a href="Cy%20Young">Cy Young</a>, <a href="Ty%20Cobb">Ty Cobb</a>, <a href="Rogers%20Hornsby">Rogers Hornsby</a>, <a href="Walter%20Johnson">Walter Johnson</a>, and <a href="John%20McGraw%20%28baseball%29">John McGraw</a>.

McAleer's contributions to the game failed to win him a place in the Baseball Hall of Fame, however. In 1936, during the <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting%2C%201936">first elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame</a>, he received just one vote in the balloting for 19th-century figures. Nevertheless, McAleer received an unofficial endorsement from Hall of Fame second baseman <a href="Nap%20Lajoie">Nap Lajoie</a>, who described McAleer as "one of the best ever". McAleer's obituary in "The New York Times" suggested that he was "one of the fastest outfielders the major leagues ever produced". In 2003, Bill James described McAleer as "the best defensive outfielder of the 1890s". More recently, baseball historian David Fleitz observed, "this brilliant defensive outfielder was a smart, clever, and ambitious man who helped to create two of the original eight franchises of the American League".

1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)

1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?) is the debut <a href="album">studio album</a> by British <a href="electronic%20music">electronic</a> band <a href="The%20KLF">The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu</a> (the JAMs), later known as <a href="the%20KLF">the KLF</a>. "1987" was produced using extensive unauthorised <a href="Sampling%20%28music%29">samples</a> that plagiarized a wide range of musical works, continuing a theme begun in the JAMs' debut single "<a href="All%20You%20Need%20Is%20Love%20%28The%20JAMs%20song%29">All You Need Is Love</a>". These samples provided a deliberately provocative backdrop for <a href="beatbox">beatbox</a> rhythms and cryptic, political raps. The album was released to mixed reviews, but was a commercial success.

Shortly after <a href="independent%20record%20label">independent release</a> in June 1987, the JAMs were ordered by the <a href="Mechanical-Copyright%20Protection%20Society">Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society</a> to destroy all unsold copies of the album, following a complaint from <a href="ABBA">ABBA</a>. In response, the JAMs disposed of many copies of "1987" in unorthodox, publicised ways. They also released a version of the album titled "1987 (The JAMs 45 Edits)", stripped of all unauthorised samples to leave periods of protracted silence and so little audible content that it was formally classed as a <a href="12-inch%20single">12-inch single</a>.

A limited edition release subjected to recall and a destruction order, "1987" became something of a rarity and by 2000, mint condition copies were trading for £60.

On New Year's Day 1987, <a href="Bill%20Drummond">Bill Drummond</a> decided to make a <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a> record under the pseudonym "the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu". Despite his small knowledge about modern <a href="music%20technology">music technology</a>, he invited <a href="Jimmy%20Cauty">Jimmy Cauty</a>, a former member of the band <a href="Brilliant%20%28band%29">Brilliant</a>, to join him. Cauty reportedly agreed, and the JAMs' debut single "<a href="All%20You%20Need%20Is%20Love%20%28The%20JAMs%20song%29">All You Need Is Love</a>" was independently released on 9 March 1987 as a limited-edition one-sided <a href="white%20label">white label</a> <a href="12-inch%20single">12-inch</a>. Cauty conceived the pseudonym "Rockman Rock", and Drummond used the nickname "King Boy D".

The reaction to "All You Need Is Love" was positive; the British music newspaper "<a href="Sounds%20%28magazine%29">Sounds</a>" listed it as the single of the week, and lauded The JAMs as "the hottest, most exhilarating band this year". "All You Need Is Love"'s reliance on uncleared, often illegal samples made commercial release impossible. In response, the JAMs re-edited the single, removing or doctoring the most antagonistic samples, and re-released it as "All You Need Is Love (106 bpm)" in May 1987. According to Drummond, profits from this re-release funded the recording of their first album. The JAMs had completed and pressed copies of the album by early May 1987, but did not have a distributor.
Like "All You Need Is Love", the album was made using an <a href="Apple%20II">Apple II</a> computer, a Greengate DS3 <a href="Sampler%20%28musical%20instrument%29">digital sampler</a> <a href="Apple%20II%20peripheral%20cards">peripheral card</a>, and a <a href="Roland%20TR-808">Roland TR-808</a> drum machine. Using portions from existing works and pasting them into new contexts, with the duo stealing "everything" and "taking... plagiarism to its absurd conclusion," several songs were liberally plagiarised. This mashup of samples was underpinned by rudimentary <a href="beatbox">beatbox</a> rhythms and overlaid with Drummond's <a href="rapping">raps</a> of social commentary, esoteric metaphors and mockery. Drummond would later say in an interview that:

We'd just got ourselves a sampler, and we went sample-crazy. We just ... went through my whole collection of records, sampling tons of stuff and putting it all together, and it ... was a real rush of excitement, when we were doing it... When we put that record out, we knew what we were doing was illegal, but we thought it was gonna be such an underground record, nobody would ever hear about it. So the first thing that shocked us is that British rock papers gave a big review.

"1987" is built around samples of other artists' work, "to the point where the presence of original material becomes questionable". The album is raw and unpolished, the sound contrasting sharply with the meticulous production and tight <a href="house%20music">house</a> rhythms of the duo's later work as the KLF. The beatbox rhythms are basic ("weedy", according to <a href="Q%20magazine">"Q" magazine</a>), samples often cut abruptly, and distinctive plagiarised melodies are often played with a high-pitched rasping accompaniment. The plagiarised works are arranged so as to juxtapose with each other as a backdrop for the JAMs' rebellious messages and social comments. Lyrics include self-referential statements of the JAMs' agenda that clash with the fictional backstory adopted from "<a href="The%20Illuminatus%21%20Trilogy">The Illuminatus! Trilogy</a>". Several songs (such as "The Queen and I" and "All You Need Is Love") have specific societal targets for Drummond's satirical raps.

The album's opening song, "Hey Hey We Are Not The Monkees", begins with simulated human <a href="sexual%20intercourse">sexual intercourse</a> noises arranged as a rhythm. The album's first sample is "Here we come..." from <a href="%28Theme%20from%29%20The%20Monkees">the Monkees' theme</a>. It progresses into a cryptic and bleak spoken verse from Drummond: "Here we come, crawling out of the mud, from chaos primeval to the burned out sun, dragging our bad selves from one end of time, with nothing to declare but some half-written rhymes". A cacophone of further samples from The Monkees' theme and Drummond's voice follow – "We're not The Monkees, I don't even "like" The Monkees!" – before it gets interrupted by an original <a href="a%20cappella">a cappella</a> vocal line that later became The KLF's "<a href="Justified%20and%20Ancient">Justified and Ancient</a>" – "We're justified/And we're ancient ... We don't want to upset the apple cart/And we don't wanna cause any harm".

The track is followed by a long sample of a <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a> train arriving at and leaving a tube station, with its recorded warning to passengers, "<a href="Mind%20the%20gap">Mind the gap</a>...". "Don't Take Five (Take What You Want)" follows, featuring The JAMs' associates Chike (rapper) and DJ Cesare (<a href="scratching">scratches</a>). Built around <a href="Dave%20Brubeck">The Dave Brubeck Quartet</a>'s "<a href="Take%20Five">Take Five</a>" and <a href="Fred%20Wesley">Fred Wesley</a>'s "Same Beat", the lyrics are mostly unconventional, with the majority of the song containing references to food: "I was pushing my trolley from detergent to cheese when I first saw the man with antler ears. I tried to ignore but his gaze held my eyes when he told me the truth about the basket of lies". "Sounds" considered the message of the song (if any) to be a modern version of <a href="Robin%20Hood">Robin Hood</a>: "This is piracy in action, with the venerable music industry figure, King Boy D, setting himself up as the Robin Hood of rap as he steals from the rich vaults of recording history".

The first side of the LP closes with "Rockman Rock (Parts 2 and 3)", a homage to <a href="Jimmy%20Cauty">Jimmy Cauty</a> that plagiarises from an array of sources, including the "<a href="Bo%20Diddley%20Beat">Bo Diddley Beat</a>" and "Sunrise Sunset" from the "<a href="Fiddler%20on%20the%20Roof">Fiddler on the Roof</a>" soundtrack. <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>'s "<a href="Whole%20Lotta%20Love">Whole Lotta Love</a>", "<a href="Since%20I%27ve%20Been%20Loving%20You">Since I've Been Loving You</a>" and "<a href="Houses%20of%20the%20Holy%20%28song%29">Houses of the Holy</a>" can be also heard in this track. Side one would not close until "Why Did You Throw Away Your Giro?", a track consisting of a question in reference to a line from "Rockman Rock" from a female adult jokingly answered by a male person, ended in 20 seconds.

The second side begins with "Mẹ Ru Con", an emotive Vietnamese song originally titled "Ca Dao Mẹ", written by <a href="Tr%E1%BB%8Bnh%20C%C3%B4ng%20S%C6%A1n">Trịnh Công Sơn</a> performed "a cappella" by The JAMs' friend Duy Khiem. According to Drummond, it was a spontaneous recital by Khiem, who was in the studio contributing clarinet and tenor sax to the album. Khiem's vocal performance was later sampled by The KLF on the <a href="ambient%20house">ambient house</a> soundtrack to their movie, "<a href="The%20Rites%20of%20Mu">The Rites of Mu</a>".

"The Queen and I" features extensive samples from ABBA's "<a href="Dancing%20Queen">Dancing Queen</a>", often overlain with a rasping detuned accompaniment. These lead into Drummond's satirical and discontent rapping, a fictional account of his march into the <a href="British%20House%20of%20Commons">British House of Commons</a> and <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> to demand answers. The song also protests the involvement of cigarette companies in sport ("When cancer is the killer/<a href="John%20Player%20%26amp%3B%20Sons">John Player</a> run the <a href="John%20Player%20League">league</a>") and lambasts the "tabloid mentality" ("They all keep talking about <a href="Diana%2C%20Princess%20of%20Wales">Princess Di</a>'s dress"). The <a href="Sex%20Pistols">Sex Pistols</a>' "<a href="God%20Save%20the%20Queen%20%28Sex%20Pistols%20song%29">God Save the Queen</a>" is briefly sampled. After nearly three minutes of samples from the television show "<a href="Top%20of%20the%20Pops">Top of the Pops</a>", as well as sound clips from programmes and advertisements on other TV channels, Drummond cries "Fuck that, let's have The JAMs!". The acerbic "<a href="All%20You%20Need%20Is%20Love%20%28The%20JAMs%20song%29">All You Need Is Love (106 bpm)</a>" follows. A "stunning audio collage" featuring an AIDS <a href="public%20information%20film">public information film</a>, a rerecording of glamour model <a href="Samantha%20Fox">Samantha Fox</a>'s "<a href="Touch%20Me%20%28I%20Want%20Your%20Body%29">Touch Me (I Want Your Body)</a>", and the <a href="nursery%20rhyme">nursery rhyme</a> "<a href="Ring%20a%20Ring%20o%27%20Roses">Ring a Ring o' Roses</a>", "All You Need Is Love" comments on sex and the British media's reaction to the AIDS crisis.

The final track on the album is "Next", which Drummond describes as "the only <a href="angst">angst-er</a> on the album", with "imagery of war and sordid sex". The track samples <a href="Stevie%20Wonder">Stevie Wonder</a>'s "<a href="Superstition%20%28song%29">Superstition</a>", <a href="Scott%20Walker%20%28singer%29">Scott Walker</a>'s "Next" from "<a href="Scott%202">Scott 2</a>", the Fall's "Totally Wired," and <a href="Julie%20Andrews">Julie Andrews</a>' "<a href="The%20Lonely%20Goatherd">The Lonely Goatherd</a>" from "<a href="The%20Sound%20of%20Music%20%28film%29">The Sound of Music</a>", alongside Khiem's original melancholy <a href="clarinet">clarinet</a> and <a href="tenor%20saxophone">tenor saxophone</a> contributions ("a saxophone of stupefying tediosity", according to <a href="Danny%20Kelly%20%28journalist%29">Danny Kelly</a>).

Bill Drummond summed up The JAMs' approach to composition in the first "KLF Information Sheet", sent out in October 1987: "We made [the album] not giving a shit for soul boy snob values or any other values, we just went in and made the noise we wanted to hear and the stuff that came out of our mouths... Not a pleasant sound but it's the noise we had. We pressed it up and stuck it out. A celebration of sorts." Jimmy Cauty defended sampling as an artistic practice: "It's not as if we're taking anything away, just borrowing and making things bigger. If you're creative you aren't going to stop working just because there is a law against what you are doing."

In 1991, Drummond admitted: "We didn't listen to "1987 What The Fuck's Going On" for a long time, and when we did we were embarrassed by it because it was so badly recorded. But I still felt we were able to get a lot out of ourselves through it."

"1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)" was released in June 1987 on The JAMs' own <a href="record%20label">record label</a>, "The Sound of Mu(sic)".

"1987" was met with mixed reviews in most of the major British music publications, including "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>", "<a href="NME">NME</a>", "Sounds", and "<a href="Q%20Magazine">Q</a>", and the album came to the attention of the management of Swedish pop group <a href="ABBA">ABBA</a>: The JAMs had sampled large portions of the ABBA single "Dancing Queen" on the track "The Queen And I". A legal showdown with ABBA and the <a href="Mechanical-Copyright%20Protection%20Society">Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society</a> (MCPS) followed, "1987" was forcibly withdrawn from sale, and The JAMs were ordered to "deliver up the master tape, mothers, stampers and any other parts commensurate with manufacture of the record".

King Boy D and Rockman Rock travelled to ABBA's home country of <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>, in the hope of meeting with ABBA personally, taking an "NME" journalist and photographer with them, along with most of the remaining copies of the LP and a gold disc of the album. Failing to find ABBA in residence at Polar Studios in Stockholm, they instead presented the gold disc to a blonde prostitute they pretended was <a href="Agnetha%20F%C3%A4ltskog">Agnetha</a> "fallen on hard times." Of the original LP's stock, some copies were disposed overboard on the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> ferry trip across, and the remainder were burned in a field in <a href="Gothenburg">Gothenburg</a> before dawn (as shown on the cover of their next album, "<a href="Who%20Killed%20The%20JAMs%3F">Who Killed The JAMs?</a>"). The JAMs also played a recording of "The Queen and I" loudly outside the offices of ABBA's record label, <a href="Polar%20Music">Polar Music</a>. The trip was unexpectedly eventful, the JAMs accidentally hitting and killing a <a href="moose">moose</a>, and later being shot at by a farmer, a bullet cracking the engine of their <a href="Ford%20Galaxie">Ford Galaxie</a> police car. They were, by their own account, towed back to England by the <a href="The%20Automobile%20Association">AA</a>.

The JAMs were not entirely sure what they would have said to ABBA if they had been able to meet them. Rockman told "NME": "We were hoping to explain [our artistic justification] to them and that maybe we'd come out of it friends, you know, them producing our album and us producing theirs—the kind of thing that often happens at these meetings." King Boy: "Yeah, we'd have said, 'Look, you haven't had many hits lately, you don't really wanna bother with all this <a href="Chess%20%28musical%29">West End musical</a> shit do you? Come and do the new JAMMS [sic] album.'" In 1994, "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" looked back on the Swedish sojourn as "a grand, futile, attention-grabbing gesture, the kind that would come to characterise [the duo's] collaborative career... "We were being totally stupid about it" Drummond later acknowledged."

The JAMs offered what they claimed were "the last five" copies of "1987" for sale at £1000 each in a full-page advertisement in the April 1988 edition of "<a href="The%20Face%20%28magazine%29">The Face</a>". Drummond argued that the offer exploited a <a href="loophole">loophole</a> in The JAMs' agreement with the MCPS: "We were browsing around this record shop and came across these five copies of "1987"... We made it perfectly clear to the MCPS that we couldn't actually force the shops to send our LPs back... [B]ecause we bought them in a shop, these LPs don't come into the agreement and we can do what we like with them and not break any laws."

<a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">"Q"</a> magazine had mixed reactions to "1987", saying that there are "too few ideas being spread too thin". The magazine criticised some songs as "overlong" and questioned the overuse of sampling as "the impression of a random hotchpotch". "Q" also unfavourably commented that The JAMs' "use of the beatbox is altogether weedy". It liked some of its tracks: "there are some wickedly amusing ideas and moments of pure poetry in the lyrics while some of the musical juxtapositions are both killingly funny and strong enough to stand repeated listenings".

A reviewer for "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>" found "1987" "inspirational", and "the most exciting, most original record [he'd] heard in years". He also argued that: "Some snatches [of plagiarised music] rather outstay their welcome, tugging tell-tale glitz away from the clifftop and dangerously close to smug obviousness, but when the blows are kept short, sharp and very bloody, they make anything else you're very likely to hear on the radio dull and desperately humourless." "It's easy to dismiss The JAMs frolics as little more than a brightly coloured sideshow to the shabbiest circus in town", a later article said, but "believe me, it's far more than a gimmick".

In awarding "1987" the highest rating, a maximum five stars, "<a href="Sounds%20magazine">Sounds</a>"—a publication that offered the duo's work consistent approval—mused, "Taking the sound "of" the moment (hip hop) as a backbone, "1987" steals sound artefacts from anywhere ... and meshes them together with King Boy's hysterical '<a href="Clydeside">Clydeside</a>' rap method with bewildering effect. ... [Y]ou could call this sampling technology's answer to <a href="T.%20S.%20Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a>'s arch cut up work, "<a href="The%20Wasteland">The Wasteland</a>". " "What's so good about The JAMs", the magazine said, "is the way they are capturing on disc the whole social and musical confusion and instability of 1987 Britain".

"<a href="NME">NME</a>"'s <a href="Danny%20Kelly%20%28journalist%29">Danny Kelly</a> was not so impressed. He also felt that the record was underdeveloped and The JAMs were not the most skilled of practitioners. "Audacity, completely unfounded self-confidence, utter ruthlessness and a fast car will, of course, be useful attributes to the go-ahead noise-pirate of the 90s, but skill, feel, instinct, vision—y'know, boring old talent—will still be bottom line compulsories... it's in these latter commodities that the JAMs seem conspicuously undertooled." Compared to the output of <a href="DJ%20Code%20Money">DJ Code Money</a> or <a href="Cut%20Creator">Cut Creator</a> ("all humour, vibrancy and colour... – aerosoled version[s] of "<a href="The%20Book%20of%20Kells">The Book of Kells</a>"") Kelly felt Drummond's efforts to be a "glitter-crusted <a href="charity%20Christmas%20card">charity Christmas card</a>". A later "NME" item called "1987" "the best comment on sampling culture ever made".

A retrospective review by <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> commented that "1987" is "a hilarious record" filled with "comments on music terrorism and [The JAMs'] own unique take on the <a href="Run-D.M.C.">Run-D.M.C.</a> type of old-school rapping"; and "The Penguin Price Guide for Record & CD Collectors" called "1987" an "entirely brilliant example of the art of disc-jockey-as-producer". Giving another retrospective review from across the Atlantic, "<a href="Trouser%20Press">Trouser Press</a>" described "1987" as "energetic" and "a loopy dance album that isn't unlike a lot of sampled records, but proceeds from an entirely different cultural understanding."

Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty were responsible for the concept and production of "1987", its lyrics and the TR-808 beatbox rhythms. Drummond provided rap, and an additional rapper introduced as 'Chike' appears on "Don't Take Five (Take What You Want)" and "Rockman Rock (Parts 2 and 3)". Duy Khiem contributed lead vocals to "Mẹ Ru Con", as well as clarinet and tenor sax to "Rockman Rock (Parts 2 and 3)" and "Next". Uncredited female vocalists on "Hey Hey We Are Not The Monkees", "Rockman Rock (Parts 2 & 3)" and "All You Need Is Love (106 bpm)" are identified by one source as <a href="Cressida%20Cauty">Cressida Cauty</a> (Jimmy's wife) and <a href="June%20Montana">June Montana</a>, the lead vocalists of the <a href="KLF%20Communications">KLF Communications</a> side project <a href="Disco%202000">Disco 2000</a>.


Following the enforced deletion of the "1987" album, the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu released an edited version as a 12" single, with all of the unauthorised samples removed, leaving sparse instrumentation, Drummond's social commentary and, in several cases, long periods of silence; the "Top of the Pops" section of the original LP yielded three minutes of silence on "45 Edits", and the only sample remaining from the original was <a href="The%20Fall%20%28band%29">The Fall</a>'s "Totally Wired."

The edited single was sold through normal retail channels and also offered as a "reward" to anyone who returned a copy of the LP to The JAMs' <a href="post%20office%20box">post office box</a>. The single was released on 16 October 1987, and on 31 October 1987 The JAMs announced that the case with ABBA "is now closed". The sleevenotes to "1987: The JAMs 45 Edits" explain to the purchaser in a rather tongue-in-cheek fashion how to recreate the original "1987" album for themselves:

This record is a version of our now deleted and illegal LP '1987, What The Fuck Is Going On?' with all of the copyright infringing 'samples' edited out. As this leaves less than 25 minutes of music we are able to sell it as a 12-inch 45. If you follow the instructions below you will, after some practice, be able to simulate the sound of our original record. To do this you will need 3 wired-up record decks, a pile of selected discs, one t.v. set and a video machine loaded with a cassette of edited highlights of last weeks 'Top of the Pops'. Deck one is to play this record on, the other two are to scratch in the missing parts using the selected records. For added authentic effect you could use a <a href="Roland%20808">Roland 808</a> drum machine (well cheap and what we used in the original recordings) to play along behind your scratching.

By 2000, a copy of the original version of "1987" in <a href="mint%20condition">mint condition</a> was worth £60, whereas a mint copy of "1987: The JAMs 45 Edits" was worth a mere £10.

Paranthodon

Paranthodon ( ) is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="stegosauria">stegosauria</a>n dinosaur that lived in <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a> during the <a href="Early%20Cretaceous">Early Cretaceous</a>, between 139 and 131 <a href="myr">million years ago</a>. Discovered in 1845, it was one of the first stegosaurians found. Its only remains, a partial skull and isolated teeth, were found in the <a href="Kirkwood%20Formation">Kirkwood Formation</a>. British paleontologist <a href="Richard%20Owen">Richard Owen</a> initially identified the fragments as those of the <a href="pareiasauria">pareiasaur</a> "<a href="Anthodon%20%28reptile%29">Anthodon</a>". After remaining untouched for years in the <a href="British%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">British Museum of Natural History</a>, the partial skull was identified by South African paleontologist <a href="Robert%20Broom">Robert Broom</a> as belonging to a different genus; he named the specimen "<a href="Palaeoscincus">Palaeoscincus</a> africanus". Several years later, Hungarian paleontologist <a href="Franz%20Nopcsa">Franz Nopcsa</a>, unaware of Broom's new name, similarly concluded that it represented a new <a href="taxon">taxon</a>, and named it "Paranthodon owenii". Since Nopcsa's species name was assigned after Broom's, and Broom did not assign a new genus, both names are now <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonym</a>s of the current binomial, "Paranthodon africanus". The genus name combines the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "para" (near) with the genus name "Anthodon", to represent the initial referral of the remains.

In identifying the remains as those of "Palaeoscincus", Broom initially classified "Paranthodon" as an <a href="ankylosaurian">ankylosaurian</a>, a statement backed by the research of Coombs in the 1970s. However, in 1929, Nopcsa identified the taxon as a <a href="Stegosauridae">stegosaurid</a>, with which most modern studies agree. In 1981, the genus was reviewed with modern taxonomy, and found to be a valid genus of stegosaurid. However, a 2018 review of "Paranthodon" could only identify one distinguishing feature, and while that study still referred it to Stegosauria based on similarity and multiple phylogenetic analyses, no diagnostic features of the group could be identified in "Paranthodon".

In <a href="1845%20in%20paleontology">1845</a>, amateur geologists <a href="William%20Guybon%20Atherstone">William Guybon Atherstone</a> and <a href="Andrew%20Geddes%20Bain">Andrew Geddes Bain</a> discovered several fossils near <a href="Dassieklip">Dassieklip</a>, <a href="Cape%20Province">Cape Province</a>, in the <a href="Bushmans%20River">Bushmans River</a> Valley. This was the first dinosaur find in all of the Southern Hemisphere and Africa. In 1849 and 1853, Bain sent some of the fossils to <a href="palaeontologist">palaeontologist</a> <a href="Richard%20Owen">Richard Owen</a> for identification. Among them was an upper jaw Bain referred to as the "Cape "<a href="Iguanodon">Iguanodon</a>"", so the site was named "Iguanodonhoek". Atherstone published a short paper about the discovery in 1857, but lamented in 1871 that it had thus far received no attention in London. Only in <a href="1876%20in%20paleontology">1876</a> were a series of specimens from the collection named by Owen as "Anthodon serrarius", basing the generic name on the resemblance of the teeth to a flower. The partial <a href="holotype">holotype</a> skull BMNH 47337, the left jaw BMNH 47338, the <a href="matrix%20%28geology%29">matrix</a> BMNH 47338 including bone fragments and impressions of the <a href="anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Anterior%20and%20posterior">anterior</a> skull, and the <a href="vertebrae">vertebrae</a> BMNH 47337a were all assigned to "Anthodon." In 1882, <a href="Othniel%20Charles%20Marsh">Othniel Charles Marsh</a> assigned "Anthodon" to <a href="Stegosauridae">Stegosauridae</a> based on BMNH 47338, and in 1890, <a href="Richard%20Lydekker">Richard Lydekker</a> found that although "Anthodon" was a <a href="pareiasauria">pareiasaur</a>, its teeth were similar to those of the Stegosauridae. Lydekker in 1890 also corrected a mistake of Owen, who had incorrectly summarized all the material as coming from a single locality, whereas there was separate material from two clearly distinct localities.

In <a href="1909%20in%20paleontology">1909</a>, <a href="Robert%20Broom">Robert Broom</a> visited the collection of the <a href="British%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">British Museum of Natural History</a>. He concluded that Owen had mixed the partial distorted skull, teeth, and a <a href="mandible">mandible</a> of a pareiasaur and a partial upper jaw of a dinosaur, BMNH 47338, which were actually from two different species. Broom kept the name "Anthodon" for the pareiasaur, but identified the other fossil as a member of the genus "<a href="Palaeoscincus">Palaeoscincus</a>", naming the new species "Paleoscincus africanus" in <a href="1912%20in%20paleontology">1912</a>. He found that the anatomy of the teeth were quite different, even though they resembled each other, as well as those of "<a href="Stegosaurus">Stegosaurus</a>". In <a href="1929%20in%20paleontology">1929</a>, Franz Nopcsa, unaware of Broom's previous publication, provided a second novel name as <a href="D.M.S.%20Watson">D.M.S. Watson</a> believed that the jaw should be differentiated from "Anthodon". Nopcsa named the species "Paranthodon Owenii", with the generic name derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "para", meaning "similar", "near", or "beside", and "Anthodon", and specific name honoring Owen. Per modern conventions, the specific name was later emended to "owenii". Both names were brought into the current nomenclature by Walter P. Coombs in his 1971 dissertation as the new combination "Paranthodon africanus", as the name "Paranthodon" was the first new generic name for the fossils and "africanus" was the first new specific name. This makes "Paranthodon africanus" the proper name for the taxon previously known as "Palaeoscincus africanus" and "Paranthodon owenii".

The holotype of "Paranthodon", BMNH 47338, was found in a layer of the <a href="Kirkwood%20Formation">Kirkwood Formation</a> that has been dated between the <a href="Berriasian">Berriasian</a> and early <a href="Valanginian">Valanginian</a> ages. It consists of the back of the snout, containing the <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a> with teeth, the posterior caudodorsal ramus of the <a href="premaxilla">premaxilla</a>, part of the <a href="nasal%20bone">nasals</a>, and some isolated teeth probably from the lower jaw. One additional specimen was assigned to it based on the <a href="dentition">dentition</a>, BMNH (now NHMUK) R4992, including only isolated teeth sharing the same morphology as those from the holotype. Some bones that were unidentified by Galton & Coombs (1981) were described as a fragment of a vertebrae in 2018 by Raven & Maidment. However, the teeth do not bear any autapomorphies of "Paranthodon", and were referred to an indeterminate stegosaurid in 2008. The teeth were identified in 2018 as also lacking any distinct stegosaurian features, and were thus designated as <a href="Thyreophora">Thyreophora</a> indeterminate.

The <a href="Mugher%20Mudstone">Mugher Mudstone</a> of <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> was screened in the 1990s by the <a href="University%20of%20California%20Museum%20of%20Paleontology">University of California Museum of Paleontology</a>, and in it were discovered multiple dinosaur teeth, pertaining to many groups of taxa. The locality has been described as "the largest and most complete record of dinosaur fossils from a Late Jurassic African locality outside of <a href="Tendaguru%20Formation">Tendaguru</a>". Two of the partial teeth discovered were referred to "Paranthodon" by Lee Hall and Mark Goodwin in <a href="2011%20in%20paleontology">2011</a>. However, the reasons for the referral to "Paranthodon" were not discussed.

"Paranthodon" was a small relative of larger stegosaurids such as "Stegosaurus". <a href="Thomas%20R.%20Holtz%20Jr.">Thomas R. Holtz Jr.</a> estimated that the animal was long and weighed between . The snout is elongated, though not extremely so, and <a href="wikt%3Aconvex">convex</a> on top. The back of the premaxilla is long and broad, and the external <a href="nostrils">nares</a> are large. The teeth have a prominent primary ridge. The fossilized nasal and maxillary bones are relatively complete, and an incomplete premaxilla is also preserved. The partial snout resembles "Stegosaurus" in its large <a href="anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Anterior%20and%20posterior">posterior</a> premaxillary process and the extension of the <a href="palate">palate</a>. However, "Stegosaurus" was the only stegosaurid known from adequate cranial material to compare with "Paranthodon" during the 1981 review of the taxon, and even though their resemblance is great, tooth <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> is very distinguishing among the stegosaurians. For example, cranial material is known from "Stegosaurus", "Paranthodon", "Kentrosaurus", and "Tuojiangosaurus", and the tooth morphology differs in all of them.

The premaxilla of "Paranthodon" is incomplete, but the anterior process is sinuous and curves <a href="anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Dorsal%20and%20ventral">ventrally</a>. This is similar to in "<a href="Miragaia">Miragaia</a>", "<a href="Huayangosaurus">Huayangosaurus</a>", the <a href="ankylosaur">ankylosaur</a> "<a href="Silvisaurus">Silvisaurus</a>", and "<a href="Heterodontosaurus">Heterodontosaurus</a>", but unlike in "<a href="Chungkingosaurus">Chungkingosaurus</a>", "<a href="Stegosaurus">Stegosaurus</a>", "<a href="Edmontonia">Edmontonia</a>" and "<a href="Lesothosaurus">Lesothosaurus</a>". The premaxilla also lacks any teeth, like in every stegosaur except "Huayangosaurus" where the premaxilla is preserved. Like in "Huayangosaurus" but not "Stegosaurus" or "<a href="Hesperosaurus">Hesperosaurus</a>", the <a href="nasal%20fenestra">nasal fenestra</a> faces anterolaterally, being visible from the front and sides. The naris is longer than wide like in other stegosaurs, and also has a smooth internal surface, so it was most likely a simple passage. The maxilla is roughly triangular, as in most other thyreophorans. The <a href="tooth%20row">tooth row</a> is horizontal in lateral view, and in ventral view it is sinuous. "Stegosaurus" and "Huayangosaurus" possess a straight tooth row in ventral view, although "<a href="Scelidosaurus">Scelidosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Jiangjunosaurus">Jiangjunosaurus</a>" do not. The maxilla of "Paranthodon" preserves the <a href="tooth%20row">tooth row</a>, and shows that there is little to no overhang. This differs from ankylosaurians, where there is a large amount of overhang of the maxilla. Like in "Stegosaurus" and "Silvisaurus" there is a <a href="diastema">diastema</a> (gap in the tooth row) on the maxilla in front of the tooth row. The posterior maxilla is incomplete so there is no information known about the <a href="jugal%20bone">jugal</a> or <a href="lacrimal%20bone">lacrimal</a> contact. "Paranthodon" has an elongate, dorsally convex nasal, like in most other stegosaurs. There are thickened ridges along the sides of the nasals. The preserved portion of the nasal does not contact the premaxilla or maxilla.

Thirteen teeth are preserved in "Paranthodon", but as they extend to the back of the maxilla there were possibly more in life. The teeth are symmetrical as in stegosaurs except "Chungkingosaurus". Along the base of the <a href="tooth%20crown">tooth crown</a> there is a swelling (<a href="cingulum%20%28tooth%29">cingulum</a>), which is seem in all other stegosaurs teeth are known from except "Huayangosaurus". The teeth have a middle ridge, with five fewer prominent ridges on either side. This is similar to the size ridges seen on "Kentrosaurus". Like all stegosaurians, the <a href="Denticle%20%28tooth%20feature%29">denticles</a> on the teeth are rounded at the tips, in contrast to ankylosaurians. Also, like "Huayangosaurus", but unlike "Kentrosaurus" and "Stegosaurus", "Paranthodon" possesses a prominent buccal margination (a ridge beside the tooth row). "Paranthodon" teeth preserve wear, but wear is absent on most teeth, similar to "Huayangosaurus", meaning it is likely that "Paranthodon" lacked <a href="occlusion%20%28dentistry%29">occlusion</a> between teeth.

As only two fragments of a vertebra are known, little anatomical details can be observed. The right <a href="transverse%20process">transverse process</a> and <a href="prezygapophysis">prezygapophysis</a> are preserved. The vertebra is possibly a middle dorsal, based on the angle of the transverse process and the orientation of the prezygapophysis. Similar to "Stegosaurus" and "Chungkingosaurus" mid-dorsals, the transverse process is angled about 60º dorsally. Unlike in all other stegosaurs except "Stegosaurus", the prezygapophysis faces dorsally.

Currently, "Paranthodon" is classified as a stegosaur related to "Stegosaurus", "<a href="Tuojiangosaurus">Tuojiangosaurus</a>", and "<a href="Loricatosaurus">Loricatosaurus</a>". Initially, when Broom assigned the name "Palaeoscincus africanus" to the "Paranthodon" fossils, he classified them as an <a href="ankylosauria">ankylosauria</a>n. This classification was later changed by Nopcsa, who found that "Paranthodon" best resembled a stegosaurid (before the group was truly defined). Coombs (1978) did not follow Nopcsa's classification, keeping "Paranthodon" as an ankylosaurian, like Broom, although he only classified it as Ankylosauria "<a href="incertae%20sedis">incertae sedis</a>". A subsequent review by Galton and Coombs in 1981 instead confirmed Nopcsa's interpretation, redescribing "Paranthodon" as a stegosaurid from the Late Cretaceous. "Paranthodon" was distinguished from other stegosaurs by a long, wide, posterior process of the premaxilla, teeth in the maxilla with a very large <a href="cingulum%20%28tooth%29">cingulum</a>, and large ridges on the <a href="tooth%20crown">tooth crown</a>s. Not all of these features were considered valid in a 2008 review of Stegosauria, with the only <a href="autapomorphy">autapomorphy</a> found being the possession of a partial second bony <a href="palate">palate</a> on the maxilla.

Multiple phylogenetic analyses have placed "Paranthodon" in Stegosauria, and often in Stegosauridae. A 2010 analysis including nearly all species of stegosaurians found that "Paranthodon" was outside Stegosauridae, and in a <a href="polytomy">polytomy</a> with "Tuojiangosaurus", "Huayangosaurus", "<a href="Chungkingosaurus">Chungkingosaurus</a>", "<a href="Jiangjunosaurus">Jiangjunosaurus</a>", and "<a href="Gigantspinosaurus">Gigantspinosaurus</a>". However, when the latter two genera were removed, "Paranthodon" grouped with "Tuojiangosaurus" just outside Stegosauridae, and "Huayangosaurus" grouped with "Chungkingosaurus" in Huayangosauridae. An elaboration upon this analysis was published in 2017 by Susannah Maidment and Thomas Raven, and it resolved relationships within Stegosauria much more. All taxa were remained included, and "Paranthodon" grouped with "Tuojiangosaurus", "Huayangosaurus" and "Chunkingosaurus" as the most basal true stegosaurians. However, the position of "<a href="Alcovasaurus">Alcovasaurus</a>" was uncertain, and further work could change the result. Below is the analysis.

Other analyses have found "Paranthodon" closely related to "Tuojiangosaurus", "Loricatosaurus", and "Kentrosaurus" within <a href="Stegosaurinae">Stegosaurinae</a>. Even though phylogenetic analyses recognize "Paranthodon" as a stegosaurid, the type material actually bears no <a href="Synapomorphy">synapomorphies</a> of Stegosauria. However, the material is likely of stegosaurian nature, and phylogenies by many authors have found it to be within the group.

The Kirkwood Formation is in South Africa, and many fossils of different species and genera have been discovered in it, with "Paranthodon" being the first uncovered. The formation is of a <a href="Late%20Jurassic">Late Jurassic</a> to <a href="Early%20Cretaceous">Early Cretaceous</a> age, with the oldest deposits from the <a href="Tithonian">Tithonian</a>, about 145.5 million years ago, and the youngest rocks being from the <a href="Valanginian">Valanginian</a>, about 130 million years ago. The specific vertebrate-bearing portion of the formation is approximately level with the upper region of the <a href="Sundays%20River%20Formation">Sundays River Formation</a>, which has been dated to 139 to 131 mya based on microfossils. A large variety of different <a href="animal">animal</a> groups have been found in the formation, including dinosaurs, at least two different <a href="sphenodontia">sphenodontia</a>n lizards, multiple <a href="teleost">teleost</a> fishes, a few <a href="crocodylian">crocodylian</a>s, some <a href="frog">frog</a> specimens, and also <a href="turtles">turtles</a>. However, a large amount of the material of the Kirkwood formation only includes isolated teeth or partial and fragmentary pieces of bone. Dinosaurs of the formation include a basal <a href="tetanuran">tetanuran</a>, the primitive <a href="ornithomimosauria">ornithomimosauria</a>n "<a href="Nqwebasaurus">Nqwebasaurus</a>", the <a href="sauropod">sauropod</a> "<a href="Algoasaurus">Algoasaurus</a>", a potential <a href="titanosauria">titanosauria</a>n, many <a href="ornithischia">ornithischia</a>ns including "Paranthodon", a genus of <a href="iguanodontia">iguanodontia</a>n, and a "<a href="hypsilophodontid">hypsilophodontid</a>" (the family Hypsilophodontidae is no longer considered to be a natural grouping). Multiple additional sauropod taxa have been discovered, including a basal <a href="eusauropod">eusauropod</a>, a <a href="brachiosaurid">brachiosaurid</a>, a <a href="dicraeosaurid">dicraeosaurid</a> and a derived <a href="diplodocid">diplodocid</a>.

If the referral of teeth from Ethiopia to "Paranthodon" is correct, then the taxons geographic range is extended significantly. The Mugher locality is approximately 151 million years old, about 14 million older than has previously been suggested for "Paranthodon", as well as across both southern and eastern Africa. The fauna in the Mugher locality differ from elsewhere of the same time and place in Africa. While the Tendaguru has abundant stegosaurs, sauropods, <a href="ornithopod">ornithopod</a>s and <a href="theropod">theropod</a>s, the Mugher Mudstone preserves the stegosaur "Paranthodon", a hypsilophodontid ornithopod, a probably sauropod, and theropods referred to <a href="Allosauridae">Allosauridae</a> and <a href="Dromaeosauridae">Dromaeosauridae</a>.

First Roumanian-American Congregation

The First Roumanian-American Congregation, also known as Congregation Shaarey Shomayim (, "Gates of Heaven"), or the Roumanishe Shul (<a href="Yiddish%20language">Yiddish</a> for "Romanian synagogue"), was an <a href="Orthodox%20Judaism">Orthodox Jewish</a> congregation that, for over 100 years, occupied a historic building at 89–93 <a href="Rivington%20Street">Rivington Street</a> on the <a href="Lower%20East%20Side">Lower East Side</a> of <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a>.

Those who organized the congregation in 1885 were part of a substantial wave of <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Romania">Romanian-Jewish</a> immigrants, most of whom settled in the Lower East Side. The Rivington Street building, built around 1860, had previously been a church, then a <a href="synagogue">synagogue</a>, then a church again, and had been extensively remodeled in 1889. It was transformed into a synagogue for a second time when the First Roumanian-American congregation purchased it in 1902 and again remodeled it.

The synagogue became famous as the "Cantor's <a href="Carnegie%20Hall">Carnegie Hall</a>", because of its high ceiling, good acoustics, and seating for up to 1,800 people. <a href="Yossele%20Rosenblatt">Yossele Rosenblatt</a>, <a href="Moshe%20Koussevitzky">Moshe Koussevitzky</a>, <a href="Zavel%20Kwartin">Zavel Kwartin</a>, <a href="Moishe%20Oysher">Moishe Oysher</a>, <a href="Jan%20Peerce">Jan Peerce</a> and <a href="Richard%20Tucker">Richard Tucker</a> were all <a href="hazzan">cantors</a> there. <a href="Red%20Buttons">Red Buttons</a> sang in the choir, <a href="George%20Burns">George Burns</a> was a member, and <a href="Edward%20G.%20Robinson">Edward G. Robinson</a> had his <a href="Bar%20and%20Bat%20Mitzvah">Bar Mitzvah</a> there.

The congregation's membership was in the thousands in the 1940s, but by the early 2000s had declined to around 40, as Jews moved out of the Lower East Side. Though its building was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1998, the congregation was reluctant to accept outside assistance in maintaining it. In December 2005, water damage was found in the structural beams, and services were moved to the living room of the rabbi's mother. In January 2006, the synagogue's roof collapsed, and the building was demolished two months later.

From 1881 through 1914, approximately 2 million Jews immigrated to the United States from Europe. An estimated three-quarters of them settled in New York City, primarily in the Lower East Side. Over 75,000 of these immigrants were from Romania, where Jews faced antisemitic laws, violence and expulsion. These hardships, combined with low crop yields and economic depression, resulted in 30 percent of the Jews in Romania emigrating to the United States.

Romanian Jewish immigrants in New York City gravitated to a fifteen-block area bounded by <a href="Allen%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">Allen</a>, <a href="Ludlow%20Street">Ludlow</a>, <a href="Houston%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">Houston</a> and <a href="Grand%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">Grand</a> streets. This "Romanian quarter" became the most densely populated part of the Lower East Side, with 1,500 to 1,800 people per block. These immigrants founded the First Roumanian-American congregation, also known as Congregation Shaarey Shamoyim.

The origins of the congregation are disputed; its establishment in 1885 may have been a re-organization of a congregation founded in 1860. Located initially close to the Romanian quarter at 70 <a href="Hester%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">Hester Street</a>, and later situated at the heart of it with the move to Rivington Street, the synagogue was the preferred house of worship for the quarter's inhabitants.

The Rivington Street building was constructed as a <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a> church around 1860 by the Second Reformed Presbyterian Church, which served the area's large German immigrant community. In November 1864 the building was sold to the Orthodox <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Germany">German-Jewish</a> Congregation Shaaray Hashomayim ("Gates of the Heavens"), which had been founded in 1841. Though its Hebrew name was essentially the same as that used by the First Roumanian-American congregation—Congregation Shaarey Shamoyim—which later purchased the building in 1902, the two congregations were unrelated.

By the late 1880s, the German-Jewish community had mostly moved from the Lower East Side. In 1889, Congregation Shaaray Hashomayim moved to 216 East 15th Street, near <a href="Second%20Avenue%20%28Manhattan%29">Second Avenue</a>, selling the Rivington Street building to the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Church%20Extension%20and%20Missionary%20Society">New York City Church Extension and Missionary Society</a> of the <a href="Methodist%20Episcopal%20Church">Methodist Episcopal Church</a>, which built or purchased churches, <a href="Mission%20%28Christian%29">missions</a>, and <a href="Sunday%20school">Sunday school</a>s in New York City.

The Church Extension and Missionary Society engaged <a href="J.%20Cleaveland%20Cady">J. Cleaveland Cady</a> to design major alterations to the structure. Cady was, at the time, New York's most famous church architect, and had designed many other public institutional buildings, including university buildings, hospitals and museums. His work included the original <a href="Metropolitan%20Opera">Metropolitan Opera</a> building (since demolished), the <a href="Richardsonian%20Romanesque">Richardsonian Romanesque</a> West 78th Street wing of the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a>, and several other buildings for the Church Extension and Missionary Society. The renovations cost approximately $36,000 (today $), and included an entirely new <a href="Romanesque%20Revival%20architecture">Romanesque Revival</a> facade in the reddish-orange brick that Cady also used on several other churches.

Renamed the Allen Street Methodist Episcopal Church (or Allen Street Memorial Church), the Rivington Street building's new purpose was to "<a href="conversion%20to%20Christianity">attract Jewish immigrants seeking conversion</a>". It was, however, unsuccessful in this endeavor. In 1895, the church's <a href="pastor">pastor</a> stated, "The existence of the church here attracts few. Our audiences are small, and contain almost no Jews."

In 1902, the First Roumanian-American congregation/Congregation Shaarey Shamoyim purchased the Rivington Street building from the Church Extension and Missionary Society to satisfy a need for a larger building to serve the Lower East Side's rapidly growing Romanian-Jewish population. At the time, the property was valued at $95,000 (today $). The funds for the purchase were raised from the members of the congregation, and to honor those contributing $10 or more, names were engraved on one of four marble slabs in the stairway to the main sanctuary. The most generous gift was $500, at a time when $10 was two weeks' pay. The congregation also took out two mortgages; one for $50,000 (today $) with the Title Insurance Company, and a second for $30,000 (today $) with the Church Extension and Missionary Society.

The congregation commissioned Charles E. Reid for extensive renovations, at a cost of $6,000 (today $). The "eclectic <a href="Neo-Byzantine%20architecture">Byzantine</a>" remodeling involved converting it for Jewish use by removing Christian symbols and adding a <a href="Torah%20ark">Torah ark</a> and "<a href="Bema%23Judaism">bimah</a>" (central platform from which the <a href="Torah">Torah</a> is read) at the sanctuary's north end. The renovations retained the original "horseshoe-shaped gallery supported by twelve <a href="Ionic%20order">Ionic columns</a>" and wooden <a href="pew">pew</a>s with reading shelves (likely from the 1889 Cady renovation), but a number of structural changes were made. Steel beams were added to support the weight of the ark and "bimah", the rear wall was re-built and the gallery extended to meet it, two <a href="Daylighting%23Skylights">skylights</a> were added (a concave <a href="stained%20glass">stained glass</a> one and a clear glass one over the ark), and at the front of the building, on top of the shallow (14 feet deep) fourth-story attic, an equally shallow fifth-story attic was added.

The completed structure filled almost the entire width of its approximately by lot, and seated 1,600 to 1,800. Dedicated in late December 1902, it was the Lower East Side's largest synagogue and only Romanesque one, and it became an "architectural and public showpiece".

By 1903 the synagogue was well established on Rivington Street, and, due to its capacity and prominence, was often the site of significant or <a href="mass%20meeting">mass meeting</a>s. In April 1903 a service to honor the memory of <a href="Reform%20Judaism">Reform</a> <a href="rabbi">rabbi</a> and <a href="Zionism">Zionist</a> leader <a href="Gustav%20Gottheil">Gustav Gottheil</a> was held there, and a similar service was held for <a href="Theodore%20Herzl">Theodore Herzl</a> the following year. At the latter service, which was boycotted by Orthodox rabbis, Herzl was not eulogized, nor was his name mentioned.

The <a href="Orthodox%20Union">Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America</a> (UOJCA) held its third annual convention at the synagogue in June 1903, attended by around 100 delegates, and presided over by the organization's president, Rabbi <a href="Henry%20Pereira%20Mendes">Henry Pereira Mendes</a>. The most important resolutions adopted at that meeting were one that deprecated the granting of a "<a href="Get%20%28divorce%20document%29">get</a>" (religious divorce document) to—or allowing subsequent re-marriage by—people who had not first obtained a civil divorce, and the request that congregations with mostly foreign-born members "secure an English-speaking rabbi for the benefit of their American-born English-speaking children". Pereira Mendes spoke in favor of the creation of a committee to bring victims of the <a href="Kishinev%20pogrom">Kishinev pogrom</a> to the United States, and against a proposal by the <a href="Union%20for%20Reform%20Judaism">Union of American Hebrew Congregations</a> (UAHC) that the <a href="Shabbat">Jewish Sabbath</a> be moved to Sunday. Pereira Mendes also announced that the UOJCA would "unite" with the UAHC and other national "religious, philanthropic, or educational" Jewish organizations in Washington "to discuss the subjects of vital concern to Judaism and Jews", while rejecting the proposition that "the main topic of the discussion at the first congress shall be the immigration problem."

At the meeting Albert Lucas also spoke out strongly against attempts by Christian groups to <a href="Proselytism">proselytize</a> Jewish children in <a href="Nursery%20school">nurseries</a> and <a href="kindergarten">kindergarten</a>s. Ostensibly to combat this proselytization, in 1903 the congregation was one of several New York City synagogues that allowed Lucas the use of its premises for free religious classes, "open to all children of the neighborhood".

In December 1905 a mass meeting was held at the synagogue to protest massacres of Jews in <a href="Russia">Russia</a> and mourn their deaths, and the congregation donated $500 to a fund for the sufferers. In March 1909 Orthodox groups held meetings there to organize opposition to the constitution and make-up of <a href="Judah%20Leon%20Magnes">Judah Leon Magnes</a>'s "Kehilla", an overarching organization intended to represent all of New York's Jews, which lasted until 1922. A mass meeting of local residents and businessmen to combat Lower East Side gangsters was held at the synagogue in 1913.

The Rivington Street synagogue was also a preferred venue for airing issues relevant specifically to Romanian-American Jews. In 1905 it was the site of New York City's only memorial service honoring <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">United States Secretary of State</a> <a href="John%20Hay">John Hay</a>, who had worked on behalf of oppressed Jews in Romania. In 1908, the synagogue hosted a meeting of over 30 religious organizations representing Romanian-American Jews, at which the formation of a federation of those organizations was proposed, and again in 1916 hosted a similar meeting of "two hundred delegates representing thirty-five organizations ... to plan incorporation of the American League of Rumanian Jews". At the latter meeting steps were taken to raise $1,000,000 (today $) for oppressed Jews in Romania, and to campaign for their "equal rights and their emancipation from <a href="thrall">thrall</a>dom".

The congregation carried out extensive charity campaigns during the <a href="Passover">Passover</a> season; by 1905 the congregation was distributing wagon-loads of "<a href="matzo">matzo</a>s" to poor Jews so they could celebrate the holiday. By 1907–1908 membership had risen to 500 (up from 160 in 1900), the <a href="Talmud%20Torah">Talmud Torah</a> had 250 students, and the synagogue's annual revenues were $25,000 (today $). The congregation ran into financial difficulties of its own in 1908, and in October of that year raised funds by selling a number of its Torah scrolls in a public auction.

Members who would become famous included <a href="George%20Burns">George Burns</a> and <a href="Bucharest">Bucharest</a>-born <a href="Edward%20G.%20Robinson">Edward G. Robinson</a>, who had his <a href="Bar%20and%20Bat%20Mitzvah">Bar Mitzvah</a> there in 1906. Robinson would later laugh that his propensity for taking the stage was demonstrated when he gave the longest Bar Mitzvah speech in the history of the congregation—"but the men sat still and listened".

In 1911 First Roumanian-American celebrated its ten-year jubilee at the synagogue. Guest speakers included <a href="United%20Synagogue%20of%20Conservative%20Judaism">United Synagogue of America</a> president <a href="Solomon%20Schechter">Solomon Schechter</a>, <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Congressman</a> <a href="Henry%20M.%20Goldfogle">Henry M. Goldfogle</a>, and the principal speaker was <a href="William%20Jay%20Gaynor">William Jay Gaynor</a>, then <a href="Mayor%20of%20New%20York%20City">Mayor of New York City</a>.

Membership had grown to 350 families by 1919. The congregational school held classes daily, and had 4 teachers and 300 students. The <a href="American%20Jewish%20Year%20Book">American Jewish Year Book</a> listed the synagogue's rabbi as Abraham Frachtenberg, a well-known cantor.

The synagogue's sanctuary had a high ceiling and "<a href="opera%20house">opera house</a>" characteristics, and was renowned for its "exquisite" or "magnificent" acoustics. Known as "the Cantor's Carnegie Hall", First Roumanian-American became a center for cantorial music, and many of the greatest cantors of the 20th century led services there. <a href="Yossele%20Rosenblatt">Yossele Rosenblatt</a>, <a href="Moshe%20Koussevitzky">Moshe Koussevitzky</a>, <a href="Zavel%20Kwartin">Zavel Kwartin</a> and <a href="Moishe%20Oysher">Moishe Oysher</a> all sang there, as did <a href="Jan%20Peerce">Jan Peerce</a> and <a href="Richard%20Tucker">Richard Tucker</a> before they became famous <a href="opera">opera</a> singers. Having a reputation for good cantorial singing had a positive impact on a synagogue's finances; congregations depended on the funds from the sale of tickets for seats on the <a href="High%20Holy%20Days">High Holy Days</a>, and the better the cantor, the greater the attendance.

<a href="Red%20Buttons">Red Buttons</a> sang at the synagogue with Rosenblatt in 1927, and when visiting the synagogue almost 70 years later could still remember the songs. Though his family actually went to a "<a href="Shtiebel">small storefront synagogue</a>", Buttons was discovered, at age eight, by a <a href="talent%20scout">talent scout</a> for Rosenblatt's Coopermans Choir, who heard him singing near the intersection of Fifth Street and <a href="Avenue%20C%20%28Manhattan%29">Avenue C</a>, at a "pickle stand". Buttons would sing in the choir for three years. <a href="Eddie%20Cantor">Eddie Cantor</a> has also been claimed as a choir member, though this is less likely.

Oysher—"the greatest of all popularizers of cantorial singing"—became the synagogue's cantor in 1935, and the congregation's membership peaked in the 1940s, when it numbered in the thousands. In a 1956 interview by <a href="Brendan%20Gill">Brendan Gill</a> in "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" magazine, Oysher described First Roumanian-American as "the most orthodox Orthodox synagogue in town". Oysher died of a heart attack two years later "at the young age of 51". The week of his death, he had said, "half-jokingly", that he wanted only one person to deliver his eulogy: Chaim Porille, rabbi of the First Roumanian-American Congregation. Porille had been born in Uscieczko (then in <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a>) in 1899, and moved to the United States in 1927, to serve as rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of <a href="Providence%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Providence, Rhode Island</a>. He became rabbi of First Roumanian-American in 1932, a post he filled until 1962, and was a member of the executive board of the <a href="Union%20of%20Orthodox%20Rabbis">Agudath Harabonim</a>. He died in September 1968.

In the years following First Roumanian-American's initial purchase and renovation of the Rivington Street building, the congregation made a number of other structural alterations. These included:

In the 1990s, the north-facing orange-red brick <a href="facade">facade</a> presented a large, compound arched brick and stone portico, with deeply recessed doors. This arch was "supported by three carved columns, two twisted columns, and a central column with a chevron pattern, each with a Byzantine-style capital", and had a stone <a href="Coping%20%28architecture%29">coping</a> on top. Carved into the portico arch in capital letters were the words "First Roumanian-American Congregation".
Originally there were large rectangular window openings on the ground floor on each side of the portico, each divided into two windows, but these had been bricked in by the 1990s. The second- and third-floor windows above them were originally stained glass but later clear glass, each second-floor window having eight square panes, and each third-floor window six panes topped with an arch. "Ornamental red <a href="terra%20cotta">terra cotta</a> panels" separated the second- and third-floor openings. On the third floor, centered above the portico, was a similar window, this one flanked by two short recessed twisted columns, each "supporting a stone <a href="lintel">lintel</a> incised with a <a href="cupid%27s%20bow">cupid's-bow</a> ornament". Similar lintels capped three-story <a href="pilaster">pilaster</a>s at each corner of the facade, and these pilasters and lintels extended around the northeast and northwest corners. The six-paned windows were each capped with a roundel and three <a href="spandrel">spandrel</a>s, "two large and one small", and these retained their original stained glass.

The shallow fourth floor was demarcated on the bottom by "a heavy <a href="frieze">frieze</a> and <a href="corbel">corbel</a>led brick <a href="cornice">cornice</a>", which supported "eight round-arched windows with molded brick <a href="voussoir">voussoir</a>s ... massed in a 3-2-3 pattern". By the 1990s these had also been bricked in. The attic on top of the fourth floor, added during the 1902–1903 renovations, was "capped by a band of small red terra-cotta blocks".

The sides of the building were faced with plain brick, and flanked by narrow alleys with iron gates at each entrance. The walls generally had plain windows, though there was a round arched one on each side of the fourth floor. One fire escape remained, in the east alley.

Inside, the building held a two-story balconied main sanctuary and dining room, in addition to the basement kitchen and bathrooms. The heating system was in a sub-basement. The front ark and wood "bimah" in the sanctuary were ornate; the red <a href="velvet">velvet</a> draped ark was elaborately decorated, and the "bimah" was also decorated, and supported a large bronze candelabra. The sanctuary floor was wood, with wood <a href="panelling">wainscoting</a> and <a href="plaster">plaster</a> walls.

The synagogue building can be seen in the 1956 film "<a href="Singing%20in%20the%20Dark">Singing in the Dark</a>", starring Oysher, and also starring (and produced by) <a href="Joey%20Adams">Joey Adams</a>. The entrance can be seen in the panoramic photograph of the corner of Ludlow and Rivington streets found on the <a href="Beastie%20Boys">Beastie Boys</a>' 1989 "<a href="Paul%27s%20Boutique">Paul's Boutique</a>" album cover foldout, and the building (and Jacob Spiegel) can also be seen in Raphael Nadjari's 2001 film "<a href="I%20Am%20Josh%20Polonski%27s%20Brother">I Am Josh Polonski's Brother</a>".

Over time the synagogue appealed to a broader constituency than just Roumanian-American Jews. Nevertheless, membership declined during the latter half of the 20th century as the <a href="Social%20mobility">upwardly mobile</a> Jewish population of the Lower East Side moved to north Manhattan, <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, and <a href="the%20Bronx">the Bronx</a>. First Roumanian-American was particularly affected: as it was an Orthodox congregation, in order to attend <a href="Shabbat">Sabbath</a> services its members had to live within walking distance.

In 1980 First Roumanian-American was one of the few congregations on the Lower East Side to still have its own Talmud Torah. This school had been housed in a small building on the east side of the synagogue that had formerly served as the church <a href="rectory">rectory</a>. The congregation was eventually forced to sell the building, but the new owners retained the school's carved sign.

Rabbi Mordecai Mayer, who had led the congregation for 20 years, died in 1981, two days before his 66th birthday. Born in <a href="Chortkiv">Chortkov</a> (then in Poland), he had graduated from the <a href="Chachmei%20Lublin%20Yeshiva">Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva</a>, and had emigrated to the United States in 1936. He had, for 40 years, conducted programs on Jewish topics on radio station <a href="WWRV">WEVD</a>, then owned by "<a href="The%20Forward">The Forward</a>". In the 1970s he was a columnist for the Yiddish weekly "<a href="Algemeiner%20Journal">Algemeiner Journal</a>", and was the author of the English-language books "Israel's Wisdom in Modern Life" (1949) and "Seeing Through Believing" (1973). He was succeeded by Jacob Spiegel.

In the early 1990s the congregation could still be assured of the required quorum of ten men for the "<a href="minyan">minyan</a>" during the week, as local businessmen attended the <a href="Jewish%20services%23Shacharit%20%28morning%20prayers%29">morning</a> and <a href="Jewish%20services%23Ma%27ariv/Arvit%20%28evening%20prayers%29">evening prayers</a> before opening and after closing their shops. By 1996, however, the membership was down to around two dozen, and Spiegel began holding services in the small social hall in the basement, as the main sanctuary had become too expensive to maintain.

With the decline in membership, the building deteriorated. In 1997 the congregation received a grant for preservation and repair of the structure from the <a href="New%20York%20Landmarks%20Conservancy">New York Landmarks Conservancy</a>, and the following year received $4,000 from the Landmarks Conservancy's Sacred Sites program for roof <a href="truss">truss</a> repairs. That same year the synagogue building was listed in the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> at the local level. In the fall of that year Shimon Attie's laser visual work "Between Dreams and History" was projected onto the synagogue and neighboring buildings for three weeks.

Spiegel had a <a href="Myocardial%20infarction">heart attack</a> and died in 2001, leaving charge of the synagogue to the youngest of his three sons, Rabbi Shmuel Spiegel. The other sons, Rabbi Gershon and Rabbi Ari, were, respectively, synagogue president and assistant rabbi. In June 2003 the name "Rabbi Yaakov Spiegel Way" was given collectively to the corner of <a href="Rivington%20Street">Rivington Street</a> and <a href="Ludlow%20Street">Ludlow Street</a> near the synagogue location and the stretch of Rivington in front of the synagogue.

The roof had long been in bad shape by the time of Jacob Spiegel's death in 2001 and it was threatening to collapse. In December of that year, Shmuel Spiegel managed to raise $25,000 for emergency repairs. However, despite offering "<a href="cholent">cholent</a>" (the traditional Sabbath lunch <a href="stew">stew</a>) at the Sabbath morning "<a href="kiddush">kiddush</a>", Spiegel had to search local streets to make the ten men for the "minyan". In 2004 the regular membership hovered around 40. Spiegel kept the synagogue running at an annual cost of around $75,000.

On January 22, 2006, the roof of the synagogue caved in, severely damaging the main sanctuary. Joshua Cohen, writing in "The Forward" in 2008, described the roof as "falling in respectfully, careful not to disturb the local nightclubs, or the wine and cheesery newly opened across the street". No one was injured, and a party to celebrate that fact was later held at the <a href="Congregation%20Chasam%20Sopher">Chasam Sopher Synagogue</a> on Clinton Street.

The <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Historic%20Preservation">National Trust for Historic Preservation</a> issued a <a href="News%20release">press release</a> about the collapse, in which it described "older religious properties, like the First Roumanian-American Synagogue" as "national treasures", and stated:
The roof collapse at First Roumanian–American Synagogue this week demonstrates that houses of worship must have access to necessary technical assistance, staff and board training, and the development of new funding sources in order to save these landmarks of spirituality, cultural tradition, and community service.

Amy Waterman, executive director of a project to repair and renovate the <a href="Eldridge%20Street%20Synagogue">Eldridge Street Synagogue</a>, noted in "The Forward":
Synagogues like the First Roumanian-American Congregation, more familiarly known as the Rumanische shul, were the first spiritual homes for successive waves of European immigrants. They were built more than 100 years ago, and just like the bridges and tunnels of New York City, they're bound to fail if not attended to.

Though First Roumanian-American had hosted a wedding as recently as October 30, 2005, the sanctuary had not been in regular use for over 10 years as a result of the difficulty maintaining it. Services had been held instead on a lower floor, and by autumn 2005 the roof was so porous that on <a href="Yom%20Kippur">Yom Kippur</a>—even in the basement—they prayed "with buckets". After a contractor found water damage in the ceiling beams in early December, the three Spiegel brothers had been holding services in their mother Chana's apartment at 383 <a href="Grand%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">Grand Street</a>, where they placed the congregation's 15 Torah scrolls following the roof cave-in. The synagogue's historic <a href="Ark%20%28synagogue%29">ark</a> was also retrieved from the ruins. According to Shmuel Spiegel, "the insurance company [was] playing hardball."

Because the building had never been registered as a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a>, after the collapse it was demolished on March 3, 2006. The <a href="New%20York%20City%20Department%20of%20Buildings">New York City Department of Buildings</a> said that the decision to demolish was the congregation's, but congregational vice president Joshua Shainberg said the Department of Buildings had left them no choice: "The Department of Buildings told us, 'You are to demolish it or we are to demolish it.' There were figures of up to $1.5 million for demolition." At the time of the building's collapse, the Spiegel brothers vowed that it would be re-built, but not nearly as large: "perhaps 20 feet high by 60 feet deep by 75 feet wide, which would cost about $2 million to $3 million".

<a href="Richard%20Price%20%28writer%29">Richard Price</a> described the collapsed building in his novel "<a href="Lush%20Life%20%28novel%29">Lush Life</a>", writing that, after the demolition, only the rear wall with a <a href="Star%20of%20David">Star of David</a> in stained glass remained: "The candlesticks were standing up in the rubble, and the whole place looked like an experimental stage set—like <a href="Shakespeare%20in%20the%20Park">Shakespeare in the Park</a>." By October 2007 all that was left was "an empty lot dotted with weeds and crushed bricks". In a 2008 addendum to his book "Dough: A Memoir", Mort Zachter described the remains as "a multimillion dollar real estate opportunity masquerading as a vacant, weed-strewn lot".

The collapse of the roof, and subsequent destruction of the synagogue, generated widespread concern and criticism among preservationists, who blamed Jacob and Shmuel Spiegel—a charge the family rejected.

Julia Vitullo-Martin, <a href="Research%20fellow">senior fellow</a> at the <a href="Manhattan%20Institute">Manhattan Institute</a> and director of its Center for Rethinking Development, stated that First Roumanian-American's roof collapse and subsequent destruction dramatized an "ongoing though undocumented synagogue crisis—particularly in poor neighborhoods" and revealed a broader problem peculiar to Jewish houses of worship: 

In the years preceding the building's collapse, the congregation had received offers of assistance from the New York Landmarks Conservancy, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, Lower East Side Conservancy, and the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Office%20of%20Parks%2C%20Recreation%20and%20Historic%20Preservation">New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation</a>, though reports on the amounts and types of assistance offered varied. The congregation, then under the leadership of Jacob Spiegel, rejected them. Joel Kaplan of the Lower East Side Conservancy stated that the congregation "didn't want the several hundred thousand dollars in landmarking grants that went to other Lower East shuls, money that could have kept the shul in repair".

The reasons given for this rejection also varied. According to Vitullo-Martin, writing in "The Wall Street Journal", Shmuel Spiegel was not sure why the offers were rejected, as the records were "buried in the rubble". Vitullo-Martin speculated that congregants might have hesitated to agree to a condition that they would need permission from the state for any sale or alteration of the building during the following 20 years. According to "The New York Times", Spiegel stated that the repairs required were so extensive that the congregation could not have made them even with this financial assistance. According to "The Jewish Week", Spiegel stated that the congregation "didn't want outside interference", was "uncomfortable with the idea of being landmarked and having to answer to landmark guidelines", and was also uncomfortable with making part of the building into a "museum of past glory", as others nearby had done.

Anthony Roll

The Anthony Roll is a record of ships of the English <a href="Tudor%20navy">Tudor navy</a> of the 1540s, named after its creator, Anthony Anthony. It originally consisted of three rolls of <a href="vellum">vellum</a>, depicting 58 naval vessels along with information on their size, crew, armament, and basic equipment. The rolls were presented to <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">King Henry VIII</a> in 1546, and were kept in the royal library. In 1680 <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> gave two of the rolls to <a href="Samuel%20Pepys">Samuel Pepys</a>, who had them cut up and bound as a single volume book, which is now in the <a href="Pepys%20Library">Pepys Library</a> at <a href="Magdalene%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Magdalene College, Cambridge</a>. The third roll remained in the royal collection until it was given by <a href="William%20IV%20of%20England">William IV</a> to his daughter, <a href="Lady%20Mary%20Fox">Mary Fox</a>, who sold it to the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> in 1858; it is now owned by the <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a>.

The Anthony Roll is the only known fully illustrated inventory of ships of the English navy in the <a href="Tudor%20period">Tudor period</a>. As the work of a successful state official in 16th century England, the artistic value of the Anthony Roll has been described as being characterised by "naive draughtsmanship and conformity to a pattern" though its artistic aspects display "a decent amateur grasp of form and colour". While the inventories listed in its text have proven to be highly accurate, most of the ship illustrations are rudimentary and made according to a set formula. The level of detail of the ship design, armament and especially rigging has therefore proven to be only approximate. Nevertheless, through their depiction of the ceremonial ornamentation the illustrations in the Roll have provided relevant secondary information to the study of Tudor period <a href="heraldry">heraldry</a>, <a href="flag">flag</a>s and ship ornamentation.

The only known contemporary depictions of prominent Tudor era vessels like the "<a href="Henry%20Grace%20%C3%A0%20Dieu">Henry Grace à Dieu</a>" and the "<a href="Mary%20Rose">Mary Rose</a>" are contained in the Anthony Roll. As the "Mary Rose" sank by accident in 1545 and was successfully salvaged in 1982, comparison between the information in the Roll and the physical evidence of the "Mary Rose" has provided new insights into the study of the naval history of the period.

Anthony Anthony has been identified as the compiler of the information and the artist behind the illustrations through his signature, which has been compared with <a href="holograph">holograph</a> letters among the State Papers. Anthony's father was William Anthony (died 1535) a <a href="Flemish%20people">Fleming</a> from <a href="Middelburg">Middelburg</a> in <a href="Zeeland">Zeeland</a> who migrated to England in 1503. William was a supplier of beer to the army, and Anthony followed in his father's footsteps. He went into beer exporting no later than 1530 and became a supplier of beer to the navy. In 1533 Anthony was appointed gunner at the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>, a position he retained nominally until his death. He rose to the rank of overseer of the <a href="Ordnance%20Office">Ordnance Office</a>, the government body responsible for supplying the armed forces with artillery, and it was in this position that he compiled his Roll. In 1549 he was promoted to master surveyor of the ordnance in the Tower, <a href="Calais">Calais</a>, <a href="Boulogne">Boulogne</a>, and elsewhere for life. He continued the work of supplying arms to English forces, and was active in the last month of his life supplying guns for an expedition against <a href="Le%20Havre">Le Havre</a>.

In 1939 Dutch historian Nicholas Beets proposed that the Flemish artist and cartographer <a href="Cornelis%20Antoniszoon">Cornelis Antoniszoon</a> (or Antonisz., c. 1507–1553) could have been Anthony Anthony's brother. Although Beets' suggestion of kinship was conjectural and without any direct evidence, it was picked up by <a href="Geoffrey%20Callender">Geoffrey Callender</a> in the "<a href="Mariner%27s%20Mirror">Mariner's Mirror</a>" in 1963 and has been relayed by several other authors. The will of William Anthony did not mention any other sons and Anthonisz. is believed to have been the son of Antonis Egbertson, the daughter of <a href="Jacob%20Corneliszoon%20van%20Oostzanen">Jacob Corneliszoon van Oostzanen</a>. That Cornelis and Anthony were related is, in the words of Ann Payne, "not, presumably, impossible, but there is little evidence that they were connected at all".

The "ship portrait" had a long history in <a href="maritime%20art">maritime art</a>, from medieval seals and coins to early <a href="engraving">engraving</a>s in the 15th century, and the plain side-on view of a ship under sail, often with no crew shown, was well established as the most effective way of recording the build of vessels. The Anthony Roll belongs to a genre of works that was intended to serve a dual role for the king and the military leadership: as reasonably informative overviews listing details of ships or strategic areas of coastlines they could be studied to determine strengths and weaknesses, and as boastful and lively depictions of Tudor military might they could be used to flatter the king, impress courtiers and impose martial authority on foreign ambassadors. Contemporary maps, or "plats", were routinely decorated with detailed pictures of ships, to mark bodies of water as much as to liven up the scenes. Such maps were common at the time, and were even embellished by artists if deemed too simple or drab. The navy was expanded during King Henry's reign, and he was known to take an interest in warships, as can be seen by the epic painting "Embarkation of Henry VIII at Dover" which portrayed, if rather unrealistically, the ships that took the 29-year-old king to the summit meeting with <a href="Francis%20I%20of%20France">Francis I</a> at the <a href="Field%20of%20the%20Cloth%20of%20Gold">Field of the Cloth of Gold</a> in 1520. This painting, recently dated to around 1545, has also been suggested as a likely source of inspiration to Anthony for his illustrations.

There are three such plats depicting naval actions and expeditions that are attributed to Anthony: the route of <a href="Anne%20of%20Cleves">Anne of Cleves</a> from the Low Countries to England (1539), a French attack on a coastal fort (date unknown) and a French raid on Brighton (July 1545). The design of the ships in these paintings, especially that of the Brighton raid, closely match those in the rolls. It is not known exactly when work on the rolls began nor when it was finished. It is only certain that it was presented to the king the year it was dated, 1546. The inclusion of the "<a href="Mary%20Rose">Mary Rose</a>" that sank at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Solent">Battle of the Solent</a> 19 July 1545 does not mean it was necessarily started before this date, since it was still considered possible that she could be raised even as late as 1549. The <a href="galleass">galleass</a>es, the "<a href="HMS%20Antelope%20%281546%29">Antelope</a>", "Hart", "Bull" and "Tiger", all present in the second roll, were still being built around March 1546, and the "Hart" was not at sea until October that year. At the same time the "Galley Blanchard", captured from the French 18 May 1546 is not included.
After the rolls were presented to the king they were archived in the royal collections. In 1680 <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> gave two of the rolls to <a href="Samuel%20Pepys">Samuel Pepys</a>, a navy administrator and avid book collector. Pepys did not disclose the details of how the rolls were given to him, but it is believed that the gift came out of a meeting with King Charles where Pepys took down the king's account of how he escaped from the <a href="Battle%20of%20Worcester">Battle of Worcester</a> (1651). The plan was that Pepys would edit and publish the already famous story, but he never did so. It is also known that Pepys was planning to write a history of the navy and that he was gathering material for this task, but this project also was never finished. It is considered likely that King Charles was aware of Pepys' plans and presented him with two of the rolls either as a gift or as payment for the intended publication of the escape story. The second roll could not be located at that time, and it was not until 1690 that it was discovered by Henry Thynne, keeper of the royal library 1677–89 and a close friend of Pepys. Thynne arranged for Pepys to make copies of some of the illustrations, but by 1690 Charles was dead and James II was in exile. Pepys had resigned from his position as Secretary of the Admiralty that same year and refused to recognize the reign of <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William III</a> and <a href="Mary%20II%20of%20England">Mary II</a>, which meant that acquisition of the final roll for his collection was out of the question. The creation of the codex from the first and third rolls is therefore assumed to have been completed shortly after that time. After Pepys' death in 1703 his library passed on to his nephew John Jackson. After the death of Jackson in 1724 the library, along with the codex, was then passed on to Pepys' old college at <a href="Magdalene%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Magdalene</a>, <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a>, where it remains to this day.

The second roll was presumed lost by the 1780s, but actually remained in the hands of the royal family. <a href="William%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">William IV</a> gave it to <a href="Lady%20Mary%20Fox">Mary FitzClarance</a>, one of his illegitimate children by the courtesan <a href="Dorothea%20Jordan">Dorothea Jordan</a>, sometime in the early 19th century. In 1824, FitzClarance married Charles Robert Fox, a major-general and from 1832–35 an officer of the surveyor of the ordnance, the same position Anthony Anthony had three centuries before him. Fox was a <a href="bibliophile">bibliophile</a>, and historian Charles Knighton has suggested he knew the value of the roll, but its location nevertheless remained unknown to scholars. In 1857 <a href="Frederic%20Madden">Frederic Madden</a>, keeper of manuscripts at the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>, was shown the second roll and learned that Mary Fox wished to sell it. After negotiations it was sold for £15 to the British Museum and was numbered <a href="Additional%20manuscripts">Additional MS</a> 22047. It was kept in its original format as a roll and has been stored in the <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a>'s manuscript collection at <a href="St%20Pancras%2C%20London">St Pancras</a> since 1999.

The Anthony Roll has been used frequently as a primary source for histories of the English navy of the 16th century but the full text and all illustrations were not collected in one volume until 2000.

The Anthony Roll was originally a set of three separate <a href="vellum">vellum</a> rolls. It exists today in the form of a bound volume containing the first and third rolls while the second roll is preserved in its original form. The three original rolls were made up out of a total of 17 individual membranes glued to the back of the next membrane. The membranes were of a width of 70 cm (27 ½ inches) and a height varying from 79 to 96 cm (31 to 37 ¾ inches). After receiving the first and third rolls Pepys had his clerks cut the rolls up and bound in a single volume as a book, now known as Pepys 2991. The transformation of the two rolls created a horizontal page structure, and some of the ornamentation that was cut in process was copied into the volume by hand. Pepys also inserted abstracts between the two rolls and a summarizing table that was not Anthony's, but pre-dated Pepys' binding of the rolls. This radical treatment of the original document has damaged some of the illustrations and is today deprecated. The first three illustrations of the "<a href="Henry%20Grace%20%C3%A0%20Dieu">Henry Grace à Dieu</a>", "<a href="Mary%20Rose">Mary Rose</a>" and "<a href="Peter%20Pomegranate">Peter Pomegranate</a>" were all too large to fit on one page and were therefore converted to two-page spreads. The resulting bend down the centre of the illustrations led to noticeable loss of detail. Despite this, there are no plans to attempt a recreation of the original structure of the first and third rolls. The second roll, British Library Additional MS 22047, is still in its original condition with the exception of a written endorsement by <a href="Mary%20Fox">Mary Fox</a> from 1857 and some damage caused by an application of chemicals to reveal faded writing.

The three rolls list 58 ships divided into classes based roughly on size and construction. Each ship is presented along with its name, tonnage, crew size and, in Anthony's own words, "the ordenaunce, artillery, munitions and habillimentes for warre". The first roll lists the <a href="carrack">carrack</a>s and one pinnace, beginning with the largest ship "Henry Grace à Dieu". The second roll lists <a href="galleass">galleass</a>es, a hybrid of oar-powered and sailing vessels, and one <a href="galley">galley</a>. Finally, the third roll is reserved for <a href="full%20rigged%20pinnace">pinnaces</a> and "rowbarges", both basically smaller versions of galleasses.

Anthony Anthony was not a trained, professional artist. The illustrations are described as "striking and boldly executed, but [...] have few claims to be fine works of art". The vessels are for the most part painted according to a standard formula, with distinct repetitions even in the more elaborate depictions. Anthony's style is signified by a "naive draughtsmanship and conformity to a pattern [...] consistent with the abilities of a government official with a decent amateur grasp of form and colour".

The rolls were all of roughly the same length, about 5.5 m (15 ft), and would most likely have been presented side by side for display on a table or hung on a wall. The focal point of the whole composition is in the second, middle roll where the exceptionally well-executed painting of the "Galley Subtle" is placed. That this ship was intended to be the centrepiece illustration is made clear by the presence of the <a href="full%20rigged%20pinnace">pinnace</a> "Mary James" in the first roll, which is otherwise reserved for (sailing) ships. This appears to have originally been placed at the beginning of the third roll, among the other pinnaces and rowbarges, but was moved to achieve more equal lengths. In his pursuit of living up to the image of a Renaissance prince Henry is known to have been particularly fond of galleys, something which would have been known to Anthony.

The lettering, framing lines and floral pattern decorations are painted in red or black with the exception of the first three ships of the first roll, which also feature gold. Most of the illustrations were first sketched with plummet outlines and were then painted over in washes. Ship timbers are a light brown that are shaded in the bow and stern to achieve depth, decorations and anchors are highlighted with red, and green is used for guns. Contours are in black and the sea is in shades varying from "greyish green" to "a richer blue".
The first two rolls were done with roughly the same amount of detail while the lesser rowbarges (essentially small galleys) were done more hastily. The first two ships of the first roll, the "Henry Grace à Dieu" and the "Mary Rose", have traces of a grid pattern, indicating that they were transferred from a different drawing while the rest are done in freehand. Overall, the ships follow a formula depending on the type of ship. The exceptions are <a href="quarter%20gallery">stern galleries</a> of some of the galleasses and the <a href="figurehead%20%28object%29">figureheads</a> of the "Mary Rose", "Salamander" and the "Unicorn", the latter both captured from the Scots in 1544. The prominent exception is the "Galley Subtle" placed in the middle of the second roll. It is more consistent in type with Mediterranean-type galleys than the galleasses and small rowbarges, and features a considerable amount of detail not present in the other ships. It is the only ship where any crew is visible, in this case rowers behind <a href="pavises">pavisades</a> as protection from enemy arrows and an overseer wearing "a <a href="Tudor%20bonnet">bonnet</a>, full skirted armorial <a href="doublet%20%28clothing%29">doublet</a> and baggy breeches" holding a stick or baton, as if beating the time of the strokes of the rowers.

As an historical record, the Anthony Roll is in many ways unique. It is the only known fully illustrated list of a Tudor period royal navy, though the pictures should not be seen as exact depictions drawn from real life. For example, the lists of guns of the individual ships, which are considered to be an accurate record produced by a senior state official, are only approximately matched to the paintings. The rigging is only roughly accurate, and has been described by <a href="Margaret%20Rule">Margaret Rule</a>, archaeological project leader of the "Mary Rose" excavations, as "a confusing assemblage of <a href="shroud%20%28sailing%29">shroud</a>s, <a href="ratlines">ratlines</a> and <a href="Stays%20%28nautical%29">stay</a>s". Many details are present, but others are missing, such as the chain-wales (the horizontal platforms extending from the sides) to which the shrouds (the parallel ropes that stabilized the masts) were attached to keep them clear of the hull.

Comparisons with the finds from the salvaged "<a href="Mary%20Rose">Mary Rose</a>" itself have provided an opportunity to compare the accuracy of the records provided in the Roll. The picture of the ship has provided clues about basic structural features, such as the number of masts and sails. When compared with an inventory of the ship from 1514, there is a close match, proving the illustration to be largely accurate. Examination of details in the construction, however, reveals that Anthony allowed himself some artistic licence. The armament in the painted ship appears clearly exaggerated. The heavy stern chasers (cannon placed in the stern aimed backwards) mounted through gun ports on the <a href="orlop%20deck">orlop deck</a>, just about the waterline, would not have been feasible because of the lack of an orlop deck and the steep angle (sheer) of the ship in this area. The number of gunports in the broadside is inaccurate since it implies two slightly staggered rows of nine ports while the surviving starboard side of the "Mary Rose" has only one row of gunports on the main deck with seven ports. The accuracy of the <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a> has been more difficult to ascertain since none of it remains; conflicting interpretations of what it looked like have been suggested.

The guns in the back of the forecastle have defied explanation, but one theory is that they were included to compensate for the guns that were positioned in the <a href="aftcastle">aftcastle</a>, aiming forwards, but which would have been obscured due to the angle from which the ship was depicted. The list of ammunition, small firearms, <a href="longbow">longbow</a>s, arrows, pikes, and <a href="Bill%20%28weapon%29">bills</a> closely matches the archaeological evidence. As the source that is closest in time to the sinking of the "Mary Rose", it has been of central importance for the archaeological project, especially in estimating the size of the crew.

The Anthony Roll provides detailed information about the flags used on the ships. According to the <a href="vexillology">vexillologist</a> Timothy Wilson, the flags depicted flying from the ships are "the most elaborate source we have for the flags flown on the ships of King Henry VIII, being richer in visual detail than all other sources put together." Among the most striking flags in the illustrations are the elongated ceremonial streamers, shown flying from all ships in varying numbers. These feature a <a href="St%20George%27s%20Cross">Saint George</a> red cross on white ground on the <a href="Flag%20terminology">hoist</a>, nearest the flagpole, and a very long tail striped in green and white. They all feature gold paint on the red and green, and silver paint (now oxidized to black) on the white. This artistic device was used either to simulate the fluttering of the flags or to actually display the metallic thread and paint that was sometimes used to decorate them.

Along the railing of all ships, most prominently on the large carracks and the "Galley Subtle", there are rows of banners displaying various heraldic designs, including the English royal arms, one or three <a href="fleur-de-lis">fleur-de-lis</a> of the French arms, Saint George's crosses and Henry VIII's monogram ("HR") in gold on blue, what appears to be the Tudor rose, and the green and white of the <a href="House%20of%20Tudor">House of Tudor</a>. The depictions of the flags and banners on the ships are in a heraldic and military sense considered to be roughly accurate but not entirely consistent. A kind of system of command among the various vessels is apparent in how flags are displayed on the masts, but it does not appear to have been carried through systematically. Some of the heraldic designs have been described as "unlikely" by the 20th century herald <a href="George%20Bellew">George Bellew</a>, but have deemed to at least be "plausible" by Wilson.

Cape sparrow

The Cape sparrow ("Passer melanurus"), or mossie, is a <a href="bird">bird</a> of the <a href="sparrow">sparrow</a> <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> Passeridae found in southern Africa. A medium-sized sparrow at , it has distinctive plumage, including large pale head stripes in both sexes. Its plumage is mostly grey, brown, and chestnut, and the male has some bold black and white markings on its head and neck. The species inhabits semi-arid <a href="savannah">savannah</a>, cultivated areas, and towns, and ranges from the central coast of Angola to eastern South Africa and <a href="Swaziland">Swaziland</a>. Three subspecies are distinguished in different parts of its range.

Cape sparrows primarily <a href="seed%20predation">eat seeds</a>, and also eat soft plant parts and insects. They typically breed in colonies, and when not breeding they gather in large nomadic flocks to move around in search of food. The nest can be constructed in a tree, a bush, a cavity, or a disused nest of another species. A typical <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> contains three or four eggs, and both parents are involved in breeding, from nest building to feeding young. The Cape sparrow is common in most of its range and coexists successfully in urban habitats with two of its relatives, the native <a href="southern%20grey-headed%20sparrow">southern grey-headed sparrow</a> and the <a href="house%20sparrow">house sparrow</a>, an <a href="introduced%20species">introduced species</a>. The Cape sparrow's population has not been recorded decreasing significantly, and it is not seriously threatened by human activities, so it is assessed as a <a href="species%20of%20least%20concern">species of least concern</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20the%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for the Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN).

For a sparrow, the Cape sparrow is strikingly coloured and distinctive, and is medium-sized at long. Adults range in weight from . The breeding male has a mostly black head, but with a broad white mark on each side, curling from behind the eye to the throat. On the throat a narrow black band connects the black bib of the breast to black of the head. The underparts are greyish, darker on the flanks. The back of the male's neck is dark grey, and its back and shoulders are bright chestnut. The male has a white and a black wing bar below its shoulders, and flight feathers and tail streaked grey and black.

The female is plumaged like the male, but is duller and has a grey head with a different pattern from the male, though it bears a hint of the pale head markings of the male. The juvenile is like the female, but young males have black markings on the head from an early age.

The Cape sparrow's <a href="bird%20vocalization">calls</a> are chirps similar to those of the <a href="house%20sparrow">house sparrow</a>, but much more musical and mellow. The basic call is used in flight and while perching socially and transcribed as "chissip", "chirrup", "chreep", or "chirrichup". A loud, distinctive call used by the male to advertise nest ownership can be written as "tweeng" or "twileeng"; this call can be extended into a jerky and repetitive song, "chip cheerup, chip cheerup".

The Cape sparrow was first described by <a href="Philipp%20Ludwig%20Statius%20M%C3%BCller">Philipp Ludwig Statius Müller</a> in 1776, as "Loxia melanura". Some other earlier biologists described the Cape sparrow in "<a href="Loxia">Loxia</a>" or "<a href="Fringilla">Fringilla</a>", but it has otherwise been regarded as a member of the <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Passer">Passer</a>" along with the <a href="house%20sparrow">house sparrow</a> and other sparrows of the Old World. Within this genus, morphological comparisons and geography were insufficient to elucidate to which species the Cape sparrow is most closely related. <a href="Mitochondrial%20DNA">Mitochondrial DNA</a> phylogenies have strongly suggested that the Cape sparrow is among the most <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> members of its genus, having diverged from the rest of the genus during the late <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a>, over 5 million years ago. It is genetically closest to the <a href="southern%20grey-headed%20sparrow">southern grey-headed sparrow</a> and the other grey-headed sparrows of Africa and the <a href="saxaul%20sparrow">saxaul sparrow</a> of <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a>, so these species may be sibling species of the Cape sparrow or similarly early offshoots.

The Cape sparrow's specific epithet comes from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> "<a href="wikt%3A%CE%BC%CE%AD%CE%BB%CE%B1%CF%82">μέλας</a>" ("melas", "black") and "<a href="wikt%3A%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%81%CE%AC">ουρά</a>" ("oura", "tail"), while the name of the genus "Passer" comes from a <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word for small birds.

The Cape sparrow has three <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>. The <a href="nominate%20subspecies">nominate subspecies</a> "Passer melanurus melanurus" is found in western South Africa, east to the western part of <a href="Free%20State%20%28South%20African%20province%29">Free State</a>. The subspecies "vicinus", which is sometimes included in subspecies "melanurus", occurs from Free State east to Eastern Cape and Lesotho. The subspecies "damarensis" ranges from the extreme southern coastal areas of Angola into <a href="Namibia">Namibia</a>, <a href="Botswana">Botswana</a> and southern <a href="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>, as well as northern South Africa.

The Cape sparrow inhabits southern Africa south of Angola and as far east as Swaziland. The northernmost point in its range is <a href="Benguela">Benguela</a> in Angola, and it is found in the coastal and central parts of Namibia, except for the driest parts of the <a href="Namib%20Desert">Namib Desert</a>. It occurs in all of South Africa except the farthest east, in southern Botswana and spottily in the <a href="Kalahari%20Basin">Kalahari Basin</a> of central Botswana. In the east, it breeds at a small number of localities in southeastern Zimbabwe. It has been recorded as a <a href="vagrancy%20%28biology%29">vagrant</a> in <a href="Harare">Harare</a>, in central Zimbabwe. The eastern limit of its range is reached in the wet forests of <a href="Limpopo">Limpopo</a> and <a href="KwaZulu%20Natal">KwaZulu Natal</a>, extending into the hills of western Swaziland.

The original habitats of this species were the semi-arid <a href="savanna">savanna</a>, <a href="thornveld">thornveld</a>, and light <a href="woodland">woodland</a> typical of southern Africa. When settled agriculture arrived in its range about a thousand years ago, it adapted to cultivated land, and since the arrival of settlement, it has moved into towns. The Cape sparrow prefers habitats with an annual rainfall of less than , though in desert areas it is usually found near watercourses or watering holes. While it occurs in urban centres, it prefers parks, gardens, and other open spaces, and has a low reproductive success in more built-up areas.

In towns, the Cape sparrow competes with both the native <a href="southern%20grey-headed%20sparrow">southern grey-headed sparrow</a> and <a href="house%20sparrow">house sparrow</a>, which was <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> to southern Africa in the 19th century. Since it is more established around humans in its range than either, it successfully competes with both species, though they may exclude it from nesting in holes. A survey by birdwatchers completed in 2000 found the Cape sparrow increasing in abundance in some suburban areas of South Africa (the northern <a href="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a> area, and <a href="Pietermaritzburg">Pietermaritzburg</a>) and decreasing in others (the southern <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a> area). The house sparrow was reported decreasing in several urban areas, as it has in parts of Europe, declines which are attributed to factors including the increasing density of garden plantings and increases in predation.

The Cape sparrow is social, lives in flocks, and usually breeds in colonies. Away from settled areas it spends much of the year wandering nomadically, in flocks of up to 200 birds. In cultivated and built up areas, smaller flocks form where food is provided for livestock or birds. In such places, it associates with other seed-eating birds, such as the house sparrow, the <a href="Cape%20weaver">Cape weaver</a>, and weavers of the genus "<a href="Euplectes">Euplectes</a>". Birds from urban areas form large flocks seasonally and fly out to the nearby countryside to feed on ripening grain, returning at night to roost.

Cape sparrows prefer to roost in nests, and while wandering outside of the breeding season, birds in uncultivated areas roost socially in old nests or dense bushes. In farmland and towns, Cape sparrows build special nests for roosting, lined more poorly than breeding nests but incorporating a greater quantity of insulating material.

An unusual social behaviour has been described from Cape sparrows in Johannesburg. Groups of 20–30 birds separate from larger flocks and stand close together on the ground with tails on the ground and heads held high. These groups sometimes move in an unconcerted fashion by hopping slowly. Often birds will fly up and hover above the ground. During these gatherings birds are silent and are never antagonistic. This behaviour's significance is unknown, and it is not reported in any other sparrow species.

The Cape sparrow mostly eats seeds, foraging in trees and on the ground. The larger seeds of <a href="cereal">cereal</a>s, wild grasses, and other small plants are preferred, with <a href="wheat">wheat</a> and khakiweed ("<a href="Alternanthera%20caracasana">Alternanthera caracasana</a>") being favourites. Buds and soft fruits are also taken, causing considerable damage to agriculture. Insects are eaten, and nestlings seem to be fed exclusively on <a href="caterpillar">caterpillar</a>s. The Cape sparrow eats the soft shoots of plants, and probes in <a href="aloe">aloe</a>s for nectar, but these are not important sources of food.

The Cape sparrow usually breeds in loose colonies of 50–100 birds. 10 to 20 percent of the breeding birds in each population nest away from colonies, for unknown reasons. The Cape sparrow is usually monogamous, but some records of a male and two females nesting and raising young in one nest have been made in <a href="Western%20Cape">Western Cape</a>. It seems pairs are formed in the non-breeding flocks, but it is not known how pairs are formed, or if the pair bond is for life. Once ready to breed, newly mated pairs look for a suitable nesting site, spending mornings searching, and returning to their flock in the afternoon. Once a site has been selected, both birds begin to build their nest. Other pairs seeking a nest site join them, and in this manner a colony forms quickly.

The <a href="courtship%20display">courtship display</a> is poorly recorded. Ornithologist <a href="J.%20Denis%20Summers-Smith">J. Denis Summers-Smith</a> observed a display in which the male hopped beside the female in a tree, drooping its wings and ruffling the chestnut-coloured feathers on its back. Groups of two or more males have been observed chasing a female. In the house sparrow a similar display exists, in which a female who is not ready to copulate is chased by her mate, who is joined by other males. It is not known if the display in the Cape sparrow has a similar significance. When ready to mate, the female crouches in solicitation and is mounted by the male. Instances of hybridisation with the house sparrow, the southern grey-headed sparrow, and captives or escapees of the <a href="Sudan%20golden%20sparrow">Sudan golden sparrow</a> have been reported.

The Cape sparrow utilises a variety of nesting sites. Bushes and trees, especially <a href="acacia">acacia</a>s, seem to be preferred, and many nests may be built in a single tree. Holes and other covered sites are chosen less frequently. Nests have been recorded from the eaves of buildings, on creepers on walls, in holes in earth banks, and in holes in haystacks. Sometimes the Cape sparrow nests in the disused nests of other birds, such as <a href="Ploceidae">weavers</a> and <a href="swallow">swallow</a>s. Pairs that nest away from colonies usually choose low bushes or utility poles as nesting sites. Nests are placed at least a metre above the ground, and can be only a few centimetres apart in colonies. Only the nest and its very close vicinity are defended as a territory. Males defend their territory with threatening postures, and sometimes by fighting with bills on the ground.

Nests built in the open are large and untidy domed structures, built of dry grass, twigs, and other plant materials. Any leaves or thorns present in a tree may be worked into the nest. In cavity nests, the hole is filled with a shapeless mass of grass with a cup of soft material containing the eggs on the inside. When the disused domed nests of weavers are used, they are given a soft lining. The nest entrance is on the side, and is sometimes extended into a short funnel. The male and the female construct the nest together, keeping close when finding material and weaving it together. The inside linings of Cape sparrow nests can incorporate large portions of aromatic leaves such as wolbossie ("<a href="Helichrysum%20pumilio">Helichrysum pumilio</a>"), thyme ("<a href="Thymus%20vulgaris">Thymus vulgaris</a>"), and camphor ("<a href="Cinnamomum">Cinnamomum</a>"). This consistent use of aromatics suggests that they have some purpose such as protection against parasites.

<a href="Clutch%20%28eggs%29">Clutches</a> contain between two and six eggs, typically three or four. Variation in clutch size depends on the amount of food available for young birds. Presumably owing to the greater availability of food, clutches are larger during the peak of the breeding season, and in more southern latitudes of the Cape sparrow's range. Both birds of a pair incubate the eggs during the day, switching every ten or fifteen minutes. At night, only the female incubates the eggs, while the male roosts outside or in the nest. In pairs breeding outside of colonies, birds leave the nest to make room for their mates upon hearing their mates approaching. Among colonial pairs, the incubating bird waits until its partner arrives in the nest, to prevent other birds from entering the nest. Incubation seems to begin before the clutch is complete, and lasts 12–24 days.

The young of a clutch hatch over two or three days and are brooded until their feathers develop and eyes open five days after hatching. The young are fed on insects until they fledge 16 to 25, typically 17, days after hatching. After this they are fed for one or two weeks. While feeding nestlings, the female is dominant over the male. Cape sparrows are among the main hosts of <a href="brood%20parasite">brood parasitism</a> by the <a href="dideric%20cuckoo">dideric cuckoo</a> in southern Africa, and sometimes parasitise nests of their own species.

The Cape sparrow is an abundant and familiar bird of human habitations and cultivation in most of southern Africa. It is not believed to be threatened, and accordingly is listed as a <a href="species%20of%20least%20concern">species of least concern</a> on the IUCN's <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">Red List</a>. It can be an agricultural pest, especially of grain cultivation and vineyards.

When vineyards in the south-west Cape started letting weeds grow between vines to conserve moisture, around 1956, the Cape sparrow moved in. Cape sparrows quickly exhausted the seeds and started eating the grapes. The Cape sparrow is now a serious pest in vineyards. Vineyards are not an optimal habitat, and some populations have had such a low reproductive success that they could not be maintained without immigration.

The Cape sparrow was featured on the lowest-denomination <a href="coins%20of%20the%20South%20African%20rand">South African coin</a>, from the farthing (¼-cent) in 1923 to the cent that ceased to be minted in 2002, with designs based on an original by <a href="George%20Kruger%20Gray">George Kruger Gray</a>. This was said to be because women interned at a concentration camp in <a href="Bethulie">Bethulie</a> during the <a href="Boer%20War">Boer War</a> adopted a biblical quotation (from <a href="Matthew%2010">Matthew 10</a>) as their motto: "Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father." It has also been featured on stamps from <a href="Lesotho">Lesotho</a> and the Central African Republic.

Russet sparrow

The russet sparrow ("Passer cinnamomeus"), also called the cinnamon or cinnamon tree sparrow, is a <a href="passerine">passerine</a> bird of the <a href="sparrow">sparrow</a> <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> Passeridae. A chunky little seed-eating bird with a thick <a href="beak">bill</a>, it has a body length of . Its <a href="plumage">plumage</a> is mainly warm <a href="rufous">rufous</a> above and <a href="grey">grey</a> below. It exhibits <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>, with the plumage of both sexes patterned similarly to that of the corresponding sex of <a href="house%20sparrow">house sparrow</a>. Its <a href="Bird%20vocalization">vocalisations</a> are sweet and musical chirps, which when strung together form a song.

Three <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> are recognised, differing chiefly in the yellowness of their underparts. The subspecies "rutilans" and "intensior" breed in parts of <a href="east%20Asia">eastern Asia</a>, where they are usually found in light woodland, and the subspecies "cinnamomeus" breeds in the <a href="Himalayas">Himalayas</a>, where it is usually associated with <a href="terrace%20%28agriculture%29">terrace cultivation</a>. The russet sparrow is the typical sparrow of human habitations in towns where the house and <a href="Eurasian%20tree%20sparrow">Eurasian tree sparrow</a>s are absent. In the southern part of its range, the russet sparrow prefers higher altitudes, but in the north it breeds by the sea. The russet sparrow is known well enough in the Himalayas to have a distinct name in some languages, and is depicted in Japanese art.

This sparrow feeds mainly on the <a href="seed">seed</a>s of <a href="herb">herb</a>s and <a href="cereal">grain</a>s, but it also eats <a href="berry">berries</a> and <a href="insect">insect</a>s, particularly during the breeding season. This diet makes it a minor pest in agricultural areas, but also a predator of insect pests. While breeding, it is not social, as its nests are dispersed. It forms flocks when not breeding, although it associates with other bird species infrequently. In some parts of its range, the russet sparrow migrates, at least to lower altitudes. Its nest is located in a tree cavity, or a hole in a cliff or building. The male chooses the nest site before finding a mate and uses the nest for <a href="courtship%20display">courtship display</a>. The typical <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> contains five or six whitish <a href="egg%20%28biology%29">eggs</a>. Both sexes incubate and feed the young.

The English ornithologist <a href="John%20Gould">John Gould</a> described a specimen of the russet sparrow collected in the Himalayas at a meeting of the <a href="Zoological%20Society%20of%20London">Zoological Society of London</a> in December 1835 under the <a href="binomial%20name">binomial name</a> "Pyrgita cinnamomea". His description was included in the volume of the society's proceedings for 1835 that was published on 8 April 1836. Its <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> comes from the <a href="New%20Latin">New Latin</a> "cinnamomeus", "cinnamon-coloured". The russet sparrow was described as "Fringilla rutilans", by the Dutch zoologist <a href="Coenraad%20Jacob%20Temminck">Coenraad Jacob Temminck</a>, from a specimen collected in <a href="Japan">Japan</a>. Temminck's description is contained in his "Nouveau recueil de planches coloriées d'oiseaux" which was issued in 102 "livraisons" or parts between 1820 and 1839. It was at one time believed that the "livraison" containing the description of the russet sparrow was issued in 1835 but it has now been established that it appeared sometime in 1836 but as the precise date is not known under the rules of the <a href="International%20Commission%20on%20Zoological%20Nomenclature">International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature</a> it is deemed to have been published on 31 December 1836. Most taxonomists give priority to Gould's publication and use the binomial name "Passer cinnamomeus" for the russet sparrow.

The russet sparrow has usually been placed in the <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Passer">Passer</a>", and within this genus it is seen as a part of the "<a href="Palearctic%20ecozone">Palearctic</a> black-bibbed sparrow" group, which includes the Eurasian tree sparrow as well as the house sparrow. It has generally been seen as a close relation of the house sparrow, and <a href="Richard%20Meinertzhagen">Richard Meinertzhagen</a> even considered it to be the same species as the <a href="Somali%20sparrow">Somali sparrow</a>, one of the house sparrow's closest relatives.

However, studies of <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> indicate that the russet sparrow is an early offshoot or <a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> species among the Palearctic black-bibbed sparrows. While mitochrondrial DNA suggests <a href="speciation">speciation</a> in "Passer" occurred during the <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> and <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a>, British ornithologist <a href="J.%20Denis%20Summers-Smith">J. Denis Summers-Smith</a> estimated that the russet sparrow separated from the other Palearctic black-bibbed sparrows about 25,000 to 15,000 years ago, during the <a href="last%20glacial%20period">last glacial period</a>. During this time, sparrows would have been isolated in ice-free <a href="refugium%20%28population%20biology%29">refugia</a>, such as the lower <a href="Yangtze%20River">Yangtze</a> valley, which Summers-Smith considered the most likely centre of evolution for the russet sparrow.

Thirteen <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> have been described, but only three are widely recognised, these differing largely in the colour of their underparts. The subspecies "Passer cinnamomea rutilans" breeds in Japan, <a href="Korea">Korea</a>, <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>, and southeastern and central <a href="China">China</a>. The subspecies "intensior", described in 1922 by <a href="Walter%20Rothschild%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Rothschild">Walter Rothschild</a> from <a href="Yunnan">Yunnan</a>, breeds in southwest China and parts of <a href="India">India</a>, <a href="Burma">Burma</a>, <a href="Laos">Laos</a>, and <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>. In a large part of <a href="Sichuan">Sichuan</a> "intensior" <a href="Intergradation">intergrades</a> with "P. c. rutilans", and a number of subspecies names have been proposed for the intergrades. The <a href="subspecies">nominate subspecies</a> "cinnamomeus", described by Gould from the northwestern Himalayas, breeds from northern <a href="Arunachal%20Pradesh">Arunachal Pradesh</a> to <a href="Nuristan%20Province">Nuristan</a> in <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>.

The russet sparrow is a small chunky bird, with <a href="plumage">plumage</a> warm <a href="rufous">rufous</a> in overall colour. It is a medium-sized sparrow at and . It has a thick <a href="beak">bill</a> suited to eating seeds, which is black on the breeding male, horn-coloured on the non-breeding male, and yellowish with a dark tip on the female. Wingspans for males range between and those for females from . Tail, bill, and <a href="Tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsus</a> lengths are , , and , respectively.

Measurements for the russet sparrow vary geographically, between the three <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>, and also within the Himalayan subspecies "cinnamomeus". The subspecies "cinnamomeus" is generally larger than the others, and within this form there is a tendency for birds at higher altitudes to be larger, and a <a href="Cline%20%28biology%29">clinal</a> variation in size with the smallest birds in the west of the range and the largest in the east.

The <a href="iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a> is <a href="chestnut%20%28color%29">chestnut</a> in colour. The legs of both sexes are pale brown to pinkish-brown. The flight of all sparrows is swift, and that of the russet sparrow is described as swifter and more direct than that of the <a href="Eurasian%20tree%20sparrow">Eurasian tree sparrow</a>.

The sexes differ, or are <a href="Sexual%20dimorphism">dimorphic</a>, in their plumage, and have a similar pattern to that in the corresponding sex of <a href="house%20sparrow">house sparrow</a>. There is some variation between the three subspecies, especially in the colouration of the underparts. Birds of the subspecies "rutilans" are off-white on their cheeks and the sides of their necks, and have pale grey underparts. Birds of the subspecies "intensior" have a pale yellow wash on their underparts and cheeks, as well as darker upperparts, while those of the subspecies "cinnamomeus" have a heavy yellow tinge to their underparts.

<a href="Moulting">Moult</a> is poorly recorded, the only records coming from <a href="Sakhalin">Sakhalin</a> and <a href="Himachal%20Pradesh">Himachal Pradesh</a>. In Sakhalin, moult occurs in August and September, between the breeding season and migration. In Himachal Pradesh, aviculturalist G. A. Perreau observed captive and wild birds and reported that they were yellow from December to spring and whitish during the remainder of the year, a pattern which may be atypical.

The breeding male is bright <a href="russet%20%28color%29">russet</a> or cinnamon red on its upperparts from its <a href="Crown%20%28anatomy%29">crown</a> to its <a href="Rump%20%28animal%29">rump</a>, with a black streaking on its mantle. It has a small black bib and black around its eye, separated from the russet of its crown by a very thin white <a href="supercilium">supercilium</a>, a stripe running from the bill to the rear of the head. The side of its neck and cheek are off-white, and its underparts are pale grey or washed with yellow, varying geographically. Shoulders and greater <a href="Covert%20%28feather%29">coverts</a> are chestnut, and its median coverts are black at the base with white at the tips. The rest of the wing is light brown with black tinges. Its tail is blackish brown, edged with ashy brown. The non-breeding male differs little from the breeding male, being paler with more orange upperparts. The only species with which the male is easily confused is the Eurasian tree sparrow, which differs in its black cheek spot and brown back.

The female has mostly pale brown upperparts, and pale grey underparts, so it resembles the female house sparrow. It differs from the house sparrow in its slightly darker, russet-tinged plumage. It has a conspicuous cream supercilium from above its eye nearly around its head, and a bold dark brown stripe through its eye. It has mostly greyish brown wings and a back streaked with black and <a href="Buff%20%28colour%29">buff</a>. The juvenile is similar to the female, though more pale and sandy. As the male reaches its first winter, it resembles the adult, differing in less bold chestnut and a dusky bib.

The russet sparrow's <a href="bird%20vocalization">vocalisations</a> are described by most sources as "the sweetest and most musical" of any sparrow. Its basic call is a "cheep" or "chilp", similar to that of other sparrows. This call is monosyllabic, unlike the house sparrow's "chirrup" call, and is softer than that of the other sparrows. This call is given as a flight call, or by displaying males. Recorded variations include a "chweep" given by males at the nest and a trilled "cheeep". Sometimes the male strings calls together and sings them in a strident tone, to create a sort of short song, transcribed as "cheep chirrup cheeweep" or "chreet-chreet-chreet". The song is interspersed with sibilant "chu-swik" notes similar to those of the <a href="white%20wagtail">white wagtail</a>. A thin "swee swee" vocalisation not unlike that of an <a href="Indian%20robin">Indian robin</a> has been reported, but the context of this call is unrecorded. During territorial disputes, males give a rapid "chit-chit-chit" call.

The russet sparrow is found in parts of eastern Asia and in the Himalayas. It is not known whether its distribution is continuous between these two areas, since the political sensitivity of the <a href="Brahmaputra%20River">Brahmaputra River</a>'s valley near the China-India border makes the area less accessible to ornithologists. In the Himalayas the russet sparrow breeds from the far northeast of India through southeastern <a href="Tibet">Tibet</a>, <a href="Bhutan">Bhutan</a>, <a href="Sikkim">Sikkim</a>, <a href="Nepal">Nepal</a>, <a href="Uttarakhand">Uttarakhand</a>, and <a href="Himachal%20Pradesh">Himachal Pradesh</a> to <a href="Kashmir">Kashmir</a> and <a href="Nuristan%20Province">Nuristan</a> in Afghanistan. Here, the russet sparrow makes short movements to lower altitudes between November and April in many areas.

In eastern Asia, the russet sparrow is found in <a href="Sakhalin">Sakhalin</a>, the <a href="Kuril%20Islands">Kuril Islands</a>, a small part of mainland <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, Japan, southern <a href="Korea">Korea</a>, and part of northern China, where it is mostly migratory. It is distributed through southern China and <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>, and the mountainous parts of <a href="Burma">Burma</a>, southern <a href="Northeast%20India">Northeast India</a>, <a href="Laos">Laos</a>, and <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, where it is mostly resident. The russet sparrow also occurs as a winter visitor in southern Japan, the further south of China, and northern <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>. In eastern Asia, the autumn migration occurs between August and November.

The russet sparrow appears to be abundant in most habitats across most of its very large range, and in the some areas it is among the most common birds. In Southeast Asia, its range has contracted at lower elevations due to <a href="global%20warming">global warming</a>, but it has also moved higher at high elevations and it remains common. Although its global population has not been quantified, it is assessed for the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> as <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> for global extinction.

Breeding takes place in <a href="mountain">mountain</a>s and <a href="Highland%20%28geography%29">uplands</a> across most of the range. This preference for high altitudes is influenced by latitude: in the farthest south of its range it never breeds below <a href="above%20mean%20sea%20level">above mean sea level</a>, but in the northernmost part of its range it often breeds by the sea. In eastern Asia, the russet sparrow prefers light <a href="woodland">woodland</a>, but it is sometimes found in towns and agricultural areas. In Sakhalin, it breeds mostly in <a href="riparian%20forest">riparian forest</a>. In <a href="Hokkaid%C5%8D">Hokkaidō</a>, the russet sparrow finds a greater food supply for its young in more remote forests, and has greater reproductive success.

In the Himalayas, it is strongly associated with <a href="terrace%20%28agriculture%29">terrace cultivation</a>, and it probably only spread to the Himalayas when these agricultural practices arrived 3000 to 4000 years ago. In towns where it occurs alongside the house or tree sparrow, it is found in gardens and less built up areas. In those <a href="hill%20station">hill station</a>s in India where both the house and the russet sparrow occur, the house sparrow breeds around more-built up areas and <a href="bazaar">bazaar</a>s, whereas the russet sparrow is "rather more up market at the larger houses with gardens and open spaces". In towns where it is the only sparrow, it is not dependent on trees, breeding around houses and eating scraps in streets. In the winter, migratory birds occur in open cultivated land and riverine <a href="grassland">grassland</a>s, but are never far from shrubs or trees.

In many aspects of its behaviour, the russet sparrow is similar to the house and Eurasian tree sparrows. Like them, it feeds on the ground, but spends most of its time perching on branches. Unlike those species, it prefers open, exposed branches for perching. The russet sparrow is described as shy and wary by some observers, but J. Denis Summers-Smith found it approachable in Indian hill stations. Flocking russet sparrows feed close to the ground, moving forward as birds from the rear of a flock move to the front, in what is called "roller feeding".

Outside its breeding season, the russet sparrow is gregarious and forms flocks to find food, though it infrequently associates with other birds. Wintering flocks tend to keep away from human habitation. The russet sparrow is also social at night during the winter, and it forms large communal roosts in trees and bushes. In the breeding season, the female roosts in the nests and the male nests in foliage nearby.

The adult russet sparrow is mostly a seed-eater, eating the seeds of herbs and weeds as well as <a href="rice">rice</a>, <a href="barley">barley</a>, and other <a href="cereal">grains</a>. <a href="Berry">Berries</a>, such as those of the kingore (certain "<a href="Berberis">Berberis</a>" spp.), are also eaten when available. Nestlings are fed mostly on <a href="insect">insect</a>s, especially <a href="caterpillar">caterpillar</a>s and <a href="larva">larva</a>l <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s obtained on trees and flying insects caught by aerial pursuit. During the breeding season adults also consume insects.

Mortality rates in the russet sparrow have not been studied, but it is known that many young birds die from "<a href="Isospora">Isospora</a>" infections, to which the bird has little resistance. Other recorded parasites of the russet sparrow include "<a href="Protocalliphora">Protocalliphora</a>" blowflies, and "<a href="Menacanthus">Menacanthus</a>" <a href="chewing%20louse">chewing lice</a>.

The russet sparrow's <a href="breeding%20season">breeding season</a> is short, lasting about three months. The Himalayan subspecies "cinnamomeus" has been recorded breeding from April to August, the nominate subspecies breeds from May to July, and the subspecies "intensior" is believed to breed in March. During its breeding season, the russet sparrow is not gregarious, and its <a href="bird%20nest">nests</a> are dispersed uniformly rather than clustered. Its nests are most frequently built in tree cavities, often disused <a href="woodpecker">woodpecker</a> nests. The russet sparrow has been recorded breeding alongside the Eurasian tree sparrow and <a href="white%20wagtail">white wagtail</a> in <a href="black%20kite">black kite</a> nests, taking advantage of the territorial defence of the kites to avoid nest predation. Other nest locations include the eaves of thatched roofs, stone walls and embankments, and electric junction boxes. In <a href="Bhutan">Bhutan</a>, it nests in holes in the outer walls of monasteries, often alongside the Eurasian tree sparrow. In Sakhalin, it will sometimes build free-standing nests in bushes. The russet sparrow also uses the disused nests of the <a href="red-rumped%20swallow">red-rumped swallow</a>, and a pair of russet sparrows has been recorded attempting to oust a pair of <a href="black-crested%20tit">black-crested tit</a>s from their nest.

The male chooses the nest site, and uses it for his <a href="courtship%20display">courtship display</a>, spending much time calling nearby. When a female comes near a male at his nest the male begins to display by raising his head, drooping his wings, pushing his chest forward, and lowering his tail. He then bows up and down in front of the female, who will lunge and then fly away if unreceptive. Both sexes take part in building the nest, which consists of a loose, untidy bunch of dry grass which fills the nesting cavity, lined with fur and feathers for warmth.

<a href="egg%20%28biology%29">Eggs</a> are elongated ovals, with a fine texture and a slight gloss. They are whitish in overall colour with a grey tinge and brown spots, streaks, or blotches. The average size of the egg is 19.2×14.2 millimetres (0.75×0.55 in). Eggs are similar to those of the Eurasian tree sparrow, differing in a duller colour and more narrow shape, though they cannot be separated from those of the other sparrows with certainty. Two <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutches</a> of four or sometimes five or six eggs are laid in a year. In Hokkaidō, clutches are laid between early May and early July, with two peaks in laying around mid May and late June. Both sexes incubate and feed the young, with the male often being more active in feeding the nestlings. In Hokkaidō, nestlings hatch weighing about , and fledge fourteen or fifteen days after hatching, weighing . The <a href="common%20cuckoo">common cuckoo</a> has been recorded in old literature as a <a href="brood%20parasite">brood parasite</a> of the russet sparrow.

In parts of the range, the russet sparrow inhabits towns, and in most of its range, it occurs near cultivation, and is a minor pest of agriculture. Though it damages crops, it also feeds its nestlings largely on insect pests. In China, the russet sparrow has been recorded as a captive bird, kept with the Eurasian tree sparrow. In Japan it was eaten in the 1870s and sold in the Yokohama game market. The russet sparrow is known well enough in the Himalayas that in most languages it has a different vernacular name from the Eurasian tree sparrow. Examples of these vernacular names include "lal gouriya" in <a href="Hindi">Hindi</a> and "kang-che-go-ma" in <a href="Tibetic%20languages">Tibetan</a>. The Japanese artist <a href="Hokusai">Hokusai</a> portrayed the russet sparrow, and due to this, it has appeared on <a href="postage%20stamp">postage stamp</a>s featuring Japanese art in Japan, <a href="The%20Gambia">The Gambia</a>, and <a href="Guyana">Guyana</a>.

Sind sparrow

The Sind sparrow ("Passer pyrrhonotus") is a <a href="passerine">passerine</a> bird of the <a href="sparrow">sparrow</a> <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a>, Passeridae, found around the <a href="Indus">Indus</a> valley region in <a href="South%20Asia">South Asia</a>. It is also known as the jungle, Sind jungle, or rufous-backed sparrow. Very similar to the related <a href="house%20sparrow">house sparrow</a>, it is smaller and has distinguishing <a href="plumage">plumage</a> features. As in the house sparrow, the male has brighter plumage than female and young birds, including black markings and a grey crown. Distinctively, the male has a chestnut stripe running down its head behind the eye, and the female has a darker head than other sparrow species. Its main <a href="bird%20vocalization">vocalisations</a> are soft chirping calls that are extended into longer songs with other sounds interspersed by breeding males. Historically, this species was thought to be very closely related to the house sparrow, but its closest evolutionary affinities may lie elsewhere. The species was discovered around 1840, but went undetected for several decades afterwards.

Within its Indus valley breeding range in <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> and western <a href="India">India</a>, the Sind sparrow is patchily distributed in riverine and wetland habitats with thorny scrub and tall grass. During the non-breeding season, some birds enter drier habitats as they disperse short distances from their breeding habitat, or migrate into western Pakistan and the extreme east of <a href="Iran">Iran</a>. Since this species is fairly common and expanding its range, it is assessed as <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>. The Sind sparrow is social while feeding and gathers in small groups both while breeding and during winter dispersal. It feeds mostly on seeds and less often on insects, foraging close to the ground. Nests are made in the branches of thorny trees, and are untidy globular masses constructed from grass or other plant matter and lined with softer material. Both sexes are involved in building the nest and caring for the young, and usually raise two clutches of three to five young each breeding season.

The Sind sparrow is very similar to the <a href="house%20sparrow">house sparrow</a>, and both sexes resemble their counterparts of that species, but it is slightly smaller and males and females each have features that distinguish them as Sind sparrows. The Sind sparrow is long, while the common South Asian <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of the house sparrow, "Passer domesticus indicus", is long. Wingspans range from , tails from , and <a href="Bird%20measurement%23tarsus">tarsi</a> measure .

The breeding male has a short and narrow black bib and a broad chestnut eye stripe that does not meet the <a href="Bird%20topography">mantle</a>. The male has a grey <a href="crown%20%28anatomy%29">crown</a> and <a href="nape">nape</a> and a <a href="rufous">rufous</a> lower back and rump. The female has a darker and greyer crown and cheek than the female house sparrow and the shoulder is darker chestnut. The female <a href="Dead%20Sea%20sparrow">Dead Sea sparrow</a> of the subspecies "Passer moabiticus yattii" is also similar to the female Sind sparrow, but has yellow tinges on the underparts and sometimes on parts of the head. The bill is black on the breeding male and pale brown on the non-breeding male and female. With a <a href="Culmen%20%28bird%29">culmen</a> length of , the Sind sparrow is slightly smaller-billed than the house sparrow.

The Sind sparrow's chirping "chup" call is softer, less strident, and higher pitched than that of the house sparrow, and is easily distinguished. The song of breeding males includes chirrups interspersed with grating "t-r-r-rt" notes and short warbles or whistles.

The Sind sparrow was first formally described by <a href="Edward%20Blyth">Edward Blyth</a>, from a specimen collected by <a href="Alexander%20Burnes">Alexander Burnes</a> at <a href="Bahawalpur">Bahawalpur</a> in around 1840. Blyth's description was published in an issue of the "<a href="Journal%20of%20the%20Asiatic%20Society%20of%20Bengal">Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal</a>" which, although dated 1844, was published only in 1845. The sparrow was not recorded until 36 years later, despite the efforts of noted ornithologists <a href="Allan%20Octavian%20Hume">Allan Octavian Hume</a> in <a href="Sindh">Sindh</a> and <a href="William%20Thomas%20Blanford">William Thomas Blanford</a> in eastern Iran. This was probably because of its general similarity to the house sparrow, though additionally, Blyth's description of the species incorrectly described its rump feathers as <a href="maroon%20%28color%29">maroon</a>, and a description by <a href="Thomas%20C.%20Jerdon">Thomas C. Jerdon</a> contained similar errors. Commenting on his unsuccessful search, Hume wrote that the hundreds of house sparrows he killed in pursuit of the Sind sparrow "ought to form a heavy load" on Blyth's conscience, and that if the Sind sparrow existed "it would be only decent for it ... to put on an appearance with as little delay as possible". Hume doubted its distinction, as did other ornithologists. The Sind sparrow was rediscovered by Scrope Berdmore Doig in 1880, in the Eastern Nara district. <a href="Ernst%20Hartert">Ernst Hartert</a> considered it a subspecies of the house sparrow, "Passer domesticus pyrrhonotus", in his "Die Vögel der paläarktishen Fauna", but Doig and <a href="Claud%20Ticehurst">Claud Ticehurst</a> both found that the two species <a href="sympatry">bred in the same areas without interbreeding</a>.

The specific epithet of the Sind sparrow, "pyrrhonotus", comes from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> "purrhos" ("flame-coloured"), and "-nōtos" ("-backed"). <a href="E.%20C.%20Stuart%20Baker">E. C. Stuart Baker</a> suggested the English name "rufous-backed sparrow", but as this name might cause confusion with other species, Ticehurst suggested the name "Sind jungle-sparrow", which became the accepted name for the species. This name refers to <a href="Sindh">Sindh</a>, a province now in Pakistan which makes up a large part of the Sind sparrow's range, and the <a href="jungle">jungle</a> habitat of the bird (in the word's original sense of tangled dry thicket). This name is shortened to "jungle sparrow" or "Sind sparrow", of which the first was used in the <a href="IOC%20World%20Bird%20List">IOC World Bird List</a>, until "Sind sparrow" was adopted in 2009.

The Sind sparrow is a member of the genus "<a href="Passer">Passer</a>", which contains the house sparrow and around twenty other species. In a 1936 review of the house sparrow's relatives, German ornithologist <a href="Wilhelm%20Meise">Wilhelm Meise</a> suggested that the Sind sparrow evolved from an isolated population of house sparrows, noting that the Indus valley is a centre of small bird types. British ornithologist <a href="J.%20Denis%20Summers-Smith">J. Denis Summers-Smith</a> considered the Sind sparrow to be part of the "<a href="Palaearctic">Palaearctic</a> black-bibbed sparrow" group including the house sparrow, though not one with a particularly close relationship with the house sparrow. Summer-Smith suggested that these species separated 25,000 to 15,000 years ago, during the <a href="last%20glacial%20period">last glacial period</a>, when sparrows would have been isolated in ice-free <a href="refugium%20%28population%20biology%29">refugia</a>, such as the <a href="Indus%20River%20Delta">Indus River Delta</a>, where he thought the Sind sparrow evolved. However, studies of <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> indicate an earlier origin of "Passer" species, with speciation occurring as early as the late <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> and early <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a>, about 5 million years ago. Hume and Ticehurst observed a resemblance, and a possible relation, between the Sind sparrow and the Dead Sea sparrow of the Middle East and Balochistan. <a href="William%20Robert%20Ogilvie-Grant">William Robert Ogilvie-Grant</a> and <a href="Henry%20Ogg%20Forbes">Henry Ogg Forbes</a> saw a resemblance to the <a href="Abd%20al-Kuri%20sparrow">Abd al-Kuri sparrow</a>, endemic to the island of <a href="Abd%20al-Kuri">Abd al-Kuri</a>, in their 1899 description of that species, noted upon by Guy M. Kirwan in a 2008 study.

The Sind sparrow has a restricted distribution, primarily occurring within the Indus valley of Pakistan, and the lower parts of the tributaries of the Indus in the <a href="Punjab%20region">Punjab region</a>. Its distribution extends from the Indus Delta north to the <a href="Kabul%20River">Kabul River</a> near <a href="Nowshera%2C%20Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa">Nowshera</a> and the <a href="Jhelum">Jhelum</a> near <a href="Nurpur%20Noon">Nurpur Noon</a>, extending east into India as far as the <a href="Delhi">Delhi</a> area. It also breeds locally in parts of Pakistan's western province of <a href="Balochistan%2C%20Pakistan">Balochistan</a>, and has been recorded several times in south-eastern Iran. The Sind sparrow is somewhat common in its restricted breeding range, and no threats are known to the survival of the species, so it is assessed as <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>.

During winter, it often makes short distance movements, and some birds move into parts of western Pakistan and an adjoining corner of <a href="Iran">Iran</a>, and less commonly north-western <a href="Gujarat">Gujarat</a>, India. Longer movements may occur, as suggested by a possible sighting in the <a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a> in November 2000.

It mostly breeds in <a href="acacia">acacia</a> and <a href="tamarisk">tamarisk</a> scrub and tall grass, invariably near rivers or other wetlands. The construction and expansion of irrigation canals has increased its habitat in Sindh, and helped it extend its range into the <a href="Yamuna">Yamuna</a> floodplain and parts of <a href="Rajasthan">Rajasthan</a>, India. It may breed around rice paddies and other fields, or human habitations, provided that there is enough cover and suitable nesting sites. In winter, it moves away from its main riverine habitat, and into drier thickets characterised by "<a href="Salvadora%20%28plant%29">Salvadora</a>" and "<a href="Capparis">Capparis</a>" bushes, but never moves too far from water.

The Sind sparrow is gregarious, generally forming small groups of four to six birds while feeding. It tends to breed in loose colonies of a few pairs, and non-breeding birds may gather to roost in acacias or tamarisks near water. During winter, the non-breeding season, it forms larger flocks of as many as 30 birds, and joins flocks with other seed-eating birds, such as house sparrows and <a href="red%20avadavat">red avadavat</a>s. The Sind sparrow feeds mainly on the seeds of grasses and other plants such as "<a href="Polygonum%20plebeium">Polygonum plebeium</a>". It may also forage for insects such as <a href="caterpillar">caterpillar</a>s, especially to feed nestlings. Flocks forage on flats alongside rivers, flying into nearby bushes and continuing to forage when disturbed.

Nesting occurs during a period of several months between April to September, the timing depending on rainfall, during which two clutches are raised by most pairs. Sind sparrows build nests in the upper branches of thorny trees or the ends of thin branches hanging over water. The nest is an untidy dome of grass and other plant matter, such as tamarisk twigs, roots, and reeds, with a diameter of about . The nest has an entrance located higher up on the sides, is somewhat flat on top, and is lined with softer plant material and feathers. The birds may sometimes build below the nests of <a href="egret">egret</a>s or extend the nest of a <a href="baya%20weaver">baya weaver</a> or <a href="pied%20myna">pied myna</a>. Both the male and female take part in nest building and incubation. Clutches typically contain three to five eggs. Scrope Doig described the eggs as being markedly smaller than the house sparrow's, measuring 0.7 × 0.5 in (1.3 × 1.8 cm) and similarly greenish or greyish with highly variable blotches, striations, and other markings.

Saxaul sparrow

The saxaul sparrow ("Passer ammodendri") is a <a href="passerine">passerine</a> bird of the <a href="sparrow">sparrow</a> <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> Passeridae, found in parts of <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a>. At and , it is among the larger sparrows. Both sexes have <a href="plumage">plumage</a> ranging from dull grey to sandy brown, and pale brown legs. Females have less boldly coloured plumage and bills, lacking the pattern of black stripes on the male's head. The head markings of both sexes make the saxaul sparrow distinctive, and unlikely to be confused with any other bird. <a href="Bird%20vocalization">Vocalisations</a> include a comparatively soft and musical chirping call, a song, and a <a href="flight%20call">flight call</a>.

Three <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> are recognised, differing in the overall tone of their plumage and in the head striping of the female. The subspecies "ammodendri" occurs in the west of the saxaul sparrow's range, while "stoliczkae" and "nigricans" occur in the east. This distribution falls into six probably disjunct areas across Central Asia, from central <a href="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a> to northern <a href="Gansu">Gansu</a> in China. A bird of deserts, the saxaul sparrow favours areas with shrubs such as the <a href="Haloxylon">saxaul</a>, near rivers and oases. Though it has lost parts of its range to <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat destruction</a> caused by agriculture, it is not seriously threatened by human activities.

Little is known of the saxaul sparrow's behaviour. Often hidden in foliage, it forages in trees and on the ground. It feeds mostly on seeds, as well as insects while breeding and as a nestling. When not breeding it forms wandering flocks, but it is less social than other sparrows while breeding, often nesting in isolated pairs. Nests are round bundles of dry plant material lined with soft materials such as feathers. They are built in holes in tree cavities, earth banks, rocky slopes, and within man-made structures or the nests of <a href="bird%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a>. Two <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutches</a> of five or six eggs are typically laid in a season. Both parents construct the nest and care for their eggs and young.

The saxaul sparrow is one of the larger sparrows at and . Wing length varies from , with males generally being larger. The tail is short at . The saxaul sparrow's legs are pale or pinkish brown, with a <a href="tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsus</a> length of . Its bill is long, pale grey on the juvenile, pale yellowish with a black tip on the breeding female, and black on the breeding male. Like all other sparrows, it flies swiftly and often at height.

Distinctive markings, especially on its head, make the saxaul sparrow unlikely to be confused with any other bird. It is dull-coloured, with plumage ranging between dull grey and warm sandy brown, varying between and within subspecies. Birds of the subspecies "ammodendri" are a sandy grey, while "nigricans" birds are similar but darker, and "stoliczkae" birds are warm brown or <a href="russet%20%28color%29">russet</a>. Birds of the subspecies "stoliczkae" and those from the southwest of the range of "ammodendri" also differ from usual "ammodendri" birds in their lack of streaking on the <a href="rump%20%28animal%29">rump</a> and upper tail <a href="covert%20%28feather%29">coverts</a>. Birds in Mongolia have a larger and deeper bill and broad bluish streaks on their chest.

The male saxaul sparrow has bold markings, with a black stripe along the top of its head and another through its eye. It has black feathering, or a "bib", on its throat and upper belly. By comparison to other sparrows this is thin on the throat, but wide on the breast. The male has a bright russet patch on the sides of its <a href="crown%20%28anatomy%29">crown</a> and nape. Its cheeks are pale grey or <a href="buff%20%28colour%29">buff</a>, and its underparts are whitish, tinged buff or grey on its sides. Its back is grey or warm brown, streaked variably with black. Its shoulders are more lightly streaked with black bars. The male's thin tail is brown, with the edges and tips of feathers paler. Its median coverts are black with a white tip, while its other wing feathers are variably dark brown, cinnamon, or black, tipped buff or whitish and edged grey. The non-breeding male differs in having slightly paler plumage.

The female is similar in some ways to the male, but paler and duller. It is sandy grey or brown, with a back patterned like that of the male, and white or whitish underparts. The head of the females of the subspecies "ammodendri" and "nigricans" is dingy grey with darker smudges on the forehead, behind its eyes, and on its throat. The female of the subspecies "stoliczkae" is buff-brown with a white throat, a conspicuous pale <a href="supercilium">supercilium</a>, darker forehead, and lighter cheeks. The juvenile is similar to the female, differing in its lack of dark tinges on its throat and crown. In adults, <a href="moulting">moulting</a> begins in July and ends in late August or early September. The post-juvenile moult is complete, and occurs variously from June to August.

The saxaul sparrow's <a href="Bird%20vocalization">vocalisations</a> are little reported. Its common call is a chirp, transcribed as "cheerp cheerp", softer and more melodious than that of the <a href="house%20sparrow">house sparrow</a>. It gives a <a href="flight%20call">flight call</a> transcribed as "twerp", and a song described by Russian naturalist V. N. Shnitnikov as "not loud, but pleasantly melodious with fairly diversified intonations".

The saxaul sparrow was first described by English zoologist <a href="John%20Gould">John Gould</a> in a March 1872 instalment of "The Birds of Asia", from a specimen collected near <a href="Kyzylorda">Kyzylorda</a>, now in southern <a href="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>, by Russian naturalist <a href="Nikolai%20Severtzov">Nikolai Severtzov</a>. Severtzov had been planning to describe the species as "Passer ammodendri" for several years and had been distributing specimens among other naturalists. When natural history dealer Charles Dode escaped from the <a href="Paris%20Commune">Paris Commune</a> in 1871 with some of his collection, Gould obtained specimens from a set of rare birds Dode exhibited to the <a href="Zoological%20Society%20of%20London">Zoological Society of London</a>. Severtzov did not describe the species until 1873, and some later writers preferred to attribute him, but Gould's description takes <a href="Principle%20of%20Priority">priority</a> over Severtzov's. The saxaul sparrow's <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">species name</a> refers to its desert habitat, coming from the name of the "<a href="Ammodendron">Ammodendron</a>" or sand acacia tree, which is in turn derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "<a href="wikt%3A%CE%AC%CE%BC%CE%BC%CE%BF%CF%82">άμμος</a>" ("ammos", "sand") and "<a href="wikt%3A%CE%B4%CE%AD%CE%BD%CE%B4%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%BD">δένδρον</a>" ("dendron", "tree"). The English name "saxaul sparrow" refers to the saxaul plant, with which it is closely associated. The saxaul sparrow usually is classified in the <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Passer">Passer</a>" with the house sparrow and around twenty other species, although a genus "Ammopasser" was created for the saxaul sparrow by <a href="Nikolai%20Zarudny">Nikolai Zarudny</a> in 1890.

The saxaul sparrow's relations within the genus "Passer" are unclear, although with its black throat feathering it has usually been considered part of the "Palaearctic black-bibbed sparrow" group related to the house sparrow. <a href="J.%20Denis%20Summers-Smith">J. Denis Summers-Smith</a> considered that the Palaearctic "Passer" sparrows evolved about 25,000 to 15,000 years ago, during the <a href="last%20glacial%20period">last glacial period</a>. During this time, sparrows would have been isolated in ice-free <a href="refugium%20%28population%20biology%29">refugia</a>, such as a certain steppe region in Central Asia, where Summers-Smith suggested the saxaul sparrow evolved. Genetic and fossil evidence suggest a much earlier origin for the "Passer" species, perhaps in the <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> and <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a>, as suggested by Luis Allende and colleagues in their 2001 <a href="phylogenetics">phylogenetic</a> analysis of <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a>. This analysis also suggested that the saxaul sparrow may be an early offshoot or <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> species in its genus, a relative of certain African sparrows such as the <a href="northern%20grey-headed%20sparrow">northern grey-headed sparrow</a>. If the saxaul sparrow is related to these species, either the saxaul sparrow formerly occurred in the deserts of Africa and Arabia, or each of the groups of "Passer" sparrows are of African origin.
Across its Central Asian distribution, the saxaul sparrow occurs in six probably <a href="disjunct%20distribution">disjunct</a> areas, and is divided into at least three subspecies. The <a href="nominate%20subspecies">nominate subspecies</a> "Passer ammodendri ammodendri" inhabits three of these areas, one in the <a href="Syr%20Darya">Syr Darya</a> basin of Kazakhstan and <a href="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a>, and another to the south of <a href="Lake%20Balkhash">Lake Balkhash</a> and the north of <a href="Almaty">Almaty</a>, where it is only common in the valley of the <a href="Ili%20River">Ili River</a>. In a third area, sometimes recognised as a subspecies "korejewi", "ammodendri" birds breed sporadically in parts of central <a href="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a>, <a href="Iran">Iran</a>, and possibly <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, migrating to the south during the winter. The subspecies "stoliczkae" was named after <a href="Ferdinand%20Stoliczka">Ferdinand Stoliczka</a> in 1874 by <a href="Allan%20Octavian%20Hume">Allan Octavian Hume</a>, from specimens Stoliczka collected in <a href="Yarkant%20County">Yarkand</a>. This subspecies is separated from the other two subspecies by the <a href="Tian%20Shan">Tian Shan</a> mountains. It is found across a broad swath of China from Kashgar east to the far west of <a href="Inner%20Mongolia">Inner Mongolia</a>, through the areas around the <a href="Taklamakan%20Desert">Taklamakan Desert</a> (but probably not in the inhospitable desert itself), and through the east of <a href="Xinjiang">Xinjiang</a>, northern <a href="Gansu">Gansu</a>, and the fringes of southern <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>. In the extreme west of the <a href="Gobi%20Desert">Gobi Desert</a> a disjunct population separated from the other "stoliczkae" birds by the <a href="Gurvan%20Saikhan%20Uul">Gurvan Saikhan Uul</a> mountains occurs, which is sometimes separated as a subspecies "timidus". The subspecies "nigricans", described by ornithologist <a href="L.%20S.%20Stepanyan">L. S. Stepanyan</a> in 1961, is found in northern Xinjiang's <a href="Manasi%20River">Manasi River</a> valley.

The saxaul sparrow is found in remote parts of <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a>, where its distribution is believed to fall into six disjunct areas, although this is uncertain due to the scarcity of records. It is found in deserts, especially around rivers and oases. It is usually found around shrubs such as saxaul ("<a href="Haloxylon">Haloxylon</a>"), poplar ("<a href="Populus">Populus</a>"), or tamarisk ("<a href="Tamarix">Tamarix</a>"). Sometimes it occurs around settlements and grain fields, especially during the winter. It is not believed to be threatened, since it is reported as locally common across a wide range, and hence it is assessed as <a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a> on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>. However, it seems to have lost large parts of its range to the intensification of agriculture and <a href="desertification">desertification</a> caused by overgrazing.

Little is known of the saxaul sparrow's behaviour, because of its remote range. It is shy in many areas, and spends much time hidden in foliage, but breeding birds in Mongolia were reported to be "quite confiding". When not breeding, it is social, and can form flocks of up to fifty birds, sometimes associating with <a href="Eurasian%20tree%20sparrow">Eurasian tree</a>, <a href="Spanish%20sparrow">Spanish</a>, and house sparrows. In some regions, it makes small local <a href="bird%20migration">migrations</a>. Towards the spring, saxaul sparrows form pairs within their flock, before dispersing in April. Seeds, especially those of the saxaul, are most of its diet, though it also eats insects, especially while breeding, most commonly <a href="weevil">weevil</a>s, <a href="grasshopper">grasshopper</a>s, and <a href="caterpillar">caterpillar</a>s. It forages in trees and on the ground. In a study of insects fed to nestlings in the <a href="Ili%20River">Ili River</a> valley, it was found that beetles are predominant, with weevils and <a href="Coccinellidae">Coccinellidae</a> comprising 60 and 30 percent of the diet of nestlings, respectively. Because of its desert habitat and scarcity, it is not a pest of agriculture. Where water is not available, the saxaul sparrow may fly several times each day over long distances to drink.

The saxaul sparrow is less social than other sparrows while breeding, due to its dry habitat and its choices of nesting locations, holes in trees and earth banks. Isolated pairs are usual, though it sometimes breeds in small groups, with members of its own species as well as house and Eurasian tree sparrows. The <a href="breeding%20season">breeding season</a> is short, lasting from May to July, with most young raised in April and June. Unusually for a sparrow, it has not been recorded nesting openly in branches, though this may simply represent the lack of published records. Nests are often built in tree cavities, where they are sometimes placed close together. Other common nesting localities are earth banks and rocky slopes, and nests have been recorded on the nests of <a href="bird%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a>, unused buildings, walls, and electricity pylons. Nests in man-made structures are increasingly common, as large trees in the saxaul sparrow's habitat are removed. Nests may be quite close to the ground, especially when they are built in trees.

The saxaul sparrow's nests are untidy dome-shaped constructions, with an entrance in the side or top. They are built of <a href="grass">grass</a>es, <a href="root">root</a>s, and other plant materials, and are lined with feathers, fur, and soft plant material. The nest is mainly built by the female, though the male may actively take part in building. Typical <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutches</a> have five or six eggs, and two clutches a year are normal. Eggs are broad and ovular, slightly pointed at an end. They are glossy, coloured white and shaded with rusty grey or yellowish brown. In some clutches, one egg is noticeably paler than the others. Four eggs collected by Zarudny from <a href="Transcaspian%20Region">Transcaspia</a> had an average size of . Females play the main part in incubating eggs, and males can often be seen guarding the nests during incubation. Males and females share in feeding their young, which they do every 4 to 12 minutes. Young that have left their nest remain nearby until well after their moult, before departing for winter flocks, followed later by the adults.

Typhoon Maemi

Typhoon Maemi (), known in the Philippines as Typhoon Pogi, was the most powerful <a href="typhoon">typhoon</a> to strike <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a> since record-keeping began in the country in 1904. Maemi formed on September 4, 2003 from a disturbance in a <a href="monsoon%20trough">monsoon trough</a> in the western <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>. It slowly intensified into Tropical Storm Maemi while moving northwestward, becoming a typhoon on September 8. That day, favorable conditions facilitated more rapid strengthening; the storm developed a well-defined <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a> and reached peak <a href="maximum%20sustained%20wind">maximum sustained wind</a>s of 195 km/h (120 mph). While near peak intensity, Maemi decelerated and began turning to the north-northeast. Soon after, the eyewall passed over the <a href="Japan">Japan</a>ese island of <a href="Miyako-jima">Miyako-jima</a> on September 10 and produced an air pressure reading of , the fourth-lowest recorded in the nation. Due to warm waters, Maemi was able to maintain much of its intensity before it made <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> just west of <a href="Busan">Busan</a>, South Korea, on September 12. The typhoon became <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical</a> in the <a href="Sea%20of%20Japan">Sea of Japan</a> (East Sea) the next day, although its remnants persisted for several days, lashing northern Japan with strong winds.

The typhoon first affected the <a href="Ryukyu%20Islands">Ryukyu Islands</a> of Japan. On <a href="Miyako-jima">Miyako-jima</a>, strong winds damaged 104 buildings and left 95% of residents without power. Maemi caused heavy rainfall there, with rates of in an hour and in 24 hours, the latter setting a record. One person died on Miyako-jima after being struck by airborne debris. Elsewhere in Japan, the storm caused flights to be canceled, and rainfall-induced landslides blocked roads. There were two other deaths in Japan, and damage totaled ¥11.3 billion <a href="Japanese%20yen">yen</a> (JPY, $96 million <a href="United%20States%20dollar">USD</a>). Damage was heaviest in South Korea, particularly where it moved ashore. On <a href="Jeju%20Province">Jeju Island</a>, Maemi produced a peak wind gust of 216 km/h (134 mph) and a minimum pressure of , both setting records for the country; the pressure reading broke the longstanding lowest pressure set by <a href="Typhoon%20Sarah%20%281959%29">Typhoon Sarah</a> in 1959. Winds in Busan near the landfall location reached 154 km/h (96 mph), the second-highest on record. The port there sustained heavy damage, restricting exports in the months following the storm. Nationwide, the high winds destroyed about 5,000 houses and damaged 13,000 homes and businesses, leaving 25,000 people homeless. About 1.47 million households lost power, and widespread crop damage occurred, resulting in the poorest rice harvest in 23 years. Across South Korea, Maemi killed 117 people, and overall damage totaled ₩5.52 trillion <a href="South%20Korean%20won">won</a> (KRW, $4.8 billion USD).

In early September 2003, a <a href="monsoon%20trough">monsoon trough</a> spawned a tropical disturbance near <a href="Guam">Guam</a>. The system consisted of a disorganized area of <a href="convection%20%28meteorology%29">convection</a>, or thunderstorms, in an area of moderate <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a>. By September 4, the convection was becoming better organized around a weak <a href="atmospheric%20circulation">low-level circulation</a>. Despite the wind shear, the system continued to develop, becoming a tropical depression north of <a href="Chuuk%20State">Chuuk State</a>. At 0200 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a> on September 5, the <a href="Joint%20Typhoon%20Warning%20Center">Joint Typhoon Warning Center</a> (JTWC) issued a <a href="Tropical%20Cyclone%20Formation%20Alert">Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert</a>, and later that day initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 15W just west of Guam. By that time, the convection had increased over the center. For the first week of its existence, the cyclone tracked generally northwestward, steered by a <a href="subtropical%20ridge">subtropical ridge</a> to the north.

Early on September 6, the <a href="Japan%20Meteorological%20Agency">Japan Meteorological Agency</a> (JMA) upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20naming">named</a> it Maemi. With more favorable conditions, including lesser wind shear and enhanced <a href="outflow%20%28meteorology%29">outflow</a>, the storm continued to intensify. The JMA upgraded Maemi to a severe tropical storm on September 7 and to typhoon status – winds of over 119 km/h (74 mph) – the next day. The JTWC had upgraded Maemi to typhoon status on September 7 after an <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a> feature appeared on satellite imagery. Also around that time, the <a href="Philippine%20Atmospheric%2C%20Geophysical%20and%20Astronomical%20Services%20Administration">Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration</a> (PAGASA) began issuing advisories on the storm, giving it the local name "Pogi", although the typhoon would remain away from the country. On September 8, Maemi began undergoing <a href="rapid%20deepening">rapid deepening</a> due to enhanced outflow, aided by the flow of an approaching <a href="Shortwave%20%28meteorology%29">shortwave trough</a>. At 1200 UTC on September 9, the JTWC estimated 1-minute <a href="maximum%20sustained%20wind">sustained winds</a> of 240 km/h (150 mph) and designated Maemi as a <a href="Typhoon%20scales">super typhoon</a>. The next day, the same agency estimated peak winds of 280 km/h (175 mph) and gusts to 335 km/h (205 mph), the equivalent of a Category 5 on the <a href="Saffir-Simpson%20hurricane%20wind%20scale">Saffir-Simpson scale</a>. At 1200 UTC on September 10, the JMA estimated peak 10-minute winds of 195 km/h (120 mph) and a minimum <a href="atmospheric%20pressure">barometric pressure</a> of while the storm was 155 km (100 mi) southeast of the Japanese island of <a href="Miyako-jima">Miyako-jima</a>. At peak intensity, Maemi was a small typhoon, with <a href="gale">gale</a>-force winds extending only 240 km (150 mi) from the well-defined eye.

Around the time of peak intensity, Maemi was slowing its forward motion and began turning to the north, after the eastward-moving trough weakened the ridge. At 1900 UTC on September 10, the typhoon passed within 10 km (7 mi) of Miyako-jima. While the eye was passing over the island, the pressure fell to and winds reached 250 km/h (155 mph). Maemi weakened slightly as it continued north, passing about 220 km (140 mi) west of <a href="Okinawa">Okinawa</a> on September 11 while undergoing an <a href="eyewall%20replacement%20cycle">eyewall replacement cycle</a>. Increasingly hostile conditions from the approaching trough caused further weakening, and the JTWC estimated the typhoon passed just east of <a href="Jeju%20Province">Jeju Island</a> with 1-minute winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) at 0600 UTC on September 12. Shortly after, Maemi made <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> just west of <a href="Busan">Busan</a>, South Korea, with the JMA estimating 10-minute winds of 140 km/h (85 mph), and JTWC estimating 1-minute winds of 165 km/h (105 mph). <a href="Daily%20Mail%20and%20General%20Trust">Risk Management Solutions</a> estimated landfall winds of 190 km/h (120 mph), which surpassed <a href="Typhoon%20Sarah%20%281959%29">Typhoon Sarah</a> in 1959. This made Maemi the strongest typhoon to strike the country since the <a href="Korea%20Meteorological%20Administration">Korea Meteorological Administration</a> began keeping records in 1904. The storm was able to maintain much of its intensity due to warm <a href="sea%20surface%20temperature">sea surface temperature</a>s and its fast forward motion. Maemi rapidly weakened to tropical storm status while moving over land, and was undergoing <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical transition</a> by the time it entered the <a href="Sea%20of%20Japan">Sea of Japan</a>. Increasing wind shear removed the convection from the increasingly ill-defined circulation center. The JTWC issued its final warning on Maemi early on September 13, declaring the storm extratropical. The JMA followed suit later that day, tracking Maemi over northern Japan and declaring it extratropical over the <a href="Sea%20of%20Okhotsk">Sea of Okhotsk</a>. The remnants of Maemi persisted for several more days, until the JMA stopped tracking it on September 16 southwest of the <a href="Kamchatka%20Peninsula">Kamchatka Peninsula</a>. According to the <a href="Mariners%20Weather%20Log">Mariners Weather Log</a>, the remnants of Maemi continued to the east, eventually striking the coast of <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> on September 21.

In Japan, the threat of the typhoon caused airlines to cancel 145 flights, mostly in and around Okinawa. About 50 <a href="United%20States%20Forces%20Japan">American army bases</a> in Okinawa were closed, and non-essential workers were told to remain home.

Before Maemi made landfall in South Korea, officials issued flood warnings along the <a href="Nakdong%20River">Nakdong River</a> due to dams opening floodgates. About 25,000 people were forced to evacuate, either to schools or relatives' houses. The Korea Meteorological Administration advised travelers to take precaution in advance of the storm. Ferry and airplane services were canceled to Jeju island, stranding residents ahead of the <a href="Chuseok">Chuseok</a> holiday.

Officials in <a href="Primorsky%20Krai">Primorsky Krai</a> in the <a href="Russian%20Far%20East">Russian Far East</a> issued a storm warning, noting the potential for strong winds and heavy rainfall.

Typhoon Maemi first affected the Japanese island of Miyako-jima, where gusts reached 266 km/h (166 mph), and sustained winds reached 152 km/h (94 mph). For 16 hours, excluding the 2–hour passage of the eye, the pressure fell to , the second-lowest on record on the island after Typhoon Sarah in 1959, and at the time the fourth lowest in all of Japan. The typhoon produced heavy rainfall on Miyako-jima totaling , of which fell in 24 hours, breaking the daily record. Also on the island, fell in one hour, and fell in just 10 minutes. On the island, Maemi damaged 104 buildings, including two severely damaged houses. The storm damaged roads in 36 locations and caused a power outage, affecting about 20,900 people, or 95% of the island. One person on Miyako-jima died after being struck by flying glass.

News agencies considered Maemi the strongest typhoon to affect Okinawa since 1968. Elsewhere in <a href="Okinawa%20Prefecture">Okinawa Prefecture</a>, wind gusts reached 109 km/h (69 mph) in <a href="Nago%2C%20Okinawa">Nago</a>. On <a href="Ishigaki%20Island">Ishigaki Island</a>, strong winds damaged houses and crops, while high tides flooded low-lying buildings. Across the region, 94 people were injured, mostly from broken glass.

Shortly before Maemi made its final landfall, it produced wind gusts of 167 km/h (104 mph) at <a href="Tsushima%2C%20Nagasaki">Izuhara</a>, a Japanese island halfway between South Korea and Japan. Along the southwest coast of Japan, a weather station in <a href="Hirado%2C%20Nagasaki">Hirado</a> reported gusts of 113 km/h (70 mph). The typhoon resulted in heavy rainfall on the Japanese main island of <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a>, reaching at a station in <a href="Miyazaki%20Prefecture">Miyazaki Prefecture</a>. Rainfall-induced landslides in <a href="Nagasaki%20Prefecture">Nagasaki</a> forced 191 people to evacuate their homes. Heavy rainfall also caused landslides in <a href="%C5%8Cita%20Prefecture">Ōita Prefecture</a>, and <a href="K%C5%8Dchi%20Prefecture">Kōchi Prefecture</a>, where several roads were closed. The threat of the storm caused schools to close in <a href="Yamaguchi%20Prefecture">Yamaguchi Prefecture</a>. The storm spawned an <a href="Fujita%20scale">F1</a> tornado in Kōchi that damaged several houses and flipped over a car, injuring a woman inside. As an extratropical storm, Maemi left 2,500 people in <a href="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a> without power after producing gusts of 108 km/h (67 mph) in <a href="Hakodate">Hakodate</a>. Wind gusts reached 116 km/h (72 mph) in <a href="Akita%2C%20Akita">Akita</a>, the third-highest September wind gust at the station. A falling tree in <a href="Sapporo">Sapporo</a> killed one person and injured two others. High waves damaged fisheries and 54 ships in <a href="Matsumae%2C%20Hokkaido">Matsumae</a> alone, and nationwide 262 ships were damaged. Rough seas also killed one person in <a href="Akita%20Prefecture">Akita Prefecture</a>. The typhoon destroyed 1,498 homes across the country and flooded 363 others. The storm also damaged of fields. In total, Maemi killed three people and injured 107 in Japan, two severely. Overall damage totaled ¥11.3 billion (<a href="Japanese%20yen">JPY</a>, $96 million <a href="United%20States%20dollar">USD</a>).

When Typhoon Maemi struck South Korea, it caused heavy rainfall that peaked at . Rainfall reached in <a href="Namhae%20County">Namhae County</a>, and on Jeju Island. The rain was less widespread and caused less flooding than <a href="Typhoon%20Rusa">Typhoon Rusa</a>, which struck the country a year prior, but damage from Maemi was heavier due to strong winds. On Jeju Island, Maemi produced a wind gust of 216 km/h (134 mph) and a minimum pressure of , both setting records for the country. The winds broke the record of 210 km/h (130 mph) set by <a href="Typhoon%20Prapiroon%20%282000%29">Typhoon Prapiroon</a> in 2000, and the pressure was 1.5 mbar lower than that during <a href="Typhoon%20Sarah%20%281959%29">Typhoon Sarah</a> in 1959, which was one of the strongest storms to strike South Korea after Maemi. On the South Korean mainland, the <a href="Gimhae%20International%20Airport">Pusan International Airport</a> reported wind gusts of 143 km/h (89 mph). Winds in Busan reached 154 km/h (96 mph), the second-highest wind speed for the city after <a href="Typhoon%20Thelma%20%281987%29">Typhoon Thelma</a> in 1987. Due to high winds, five <a href="Nuclear%20power%20in%20South%20Korea">nuclear power plants</a> were shut down automatically, but were ultimately unaffected.

In South Korea, damage was heaviest in <a href="South%20Gyeongsang%20Province">South Gyeongsang Province</a>, where 71 people were killed. Damage was particularly heavy in Busan, as well in as <a href="Yecheon%20County">Yecheon</a>, <a href="Ulsan">Ulsan</a>, and <a href="Daegu">Daegu</a>. In Busan, strong winds wrecked 11 lifting cranes, each weighing about 900 tons, which injured five people and killed two in one incident. Many shipyards in the region were closed, and initial reports estimated it would take a year to fully reopen the Busan port. The estimated damage to the Busan port was about $50 million (USD), causing cargo capacity to be cut by 20%. High waves turned a large ship on its side in Busan, and in <a href="Ulsan">Ulsan</a> the waves knocked an offshore shipbuilding plant into a petroleum facility, damaging them both. Sixteen people were killed in Busan.

High tides flooded hundreds of houses along the coast, particularly in areas without seawalls. In <a href="Masan">Masan</a>, the storm caused 12 fatalities when it flooded an underground shopping center. On Jeju Island to the south of the country, Maemi destroyed sets of the <a href="Korean%20drama">Korean drama</a> TV series <a href="All%20In%20%28TV%20series%29">All In</a>, and wrecked 32 houses. Two people were killed on the island, one of whom while attempting to secure his boat. Throughout the country, 465 boats were damaged or beached. The heavy rainfall caused mudslides, one of which in <a href="Chungcheong">Chungcheong</a> derailed a train, injuring 28 aboard. Mudslides closed several roads, and damaged five rail lines in ten locations. Nationwide, the storm damaged 2,278 roads and bridges, as well as nearly 40,000 cars. Intense rainfall also caused flooding along the Nakdong River, reaching a <a href="flood%20stage">flood stage</a> of near Busan. There, the river produced a <a href="discharge%20%28hydrology%29">discharge</a> of about 13,000 <a href="m%C2%B3/s">m³/s</a> (460,000 <a href="cubic%20foot">ft³/s</a>), strong enough to destroy a section of the Gupo bridge. Along a tributary of the Nakdong River, floods destroyed a dyke near <a href="Daegu">Daegu</a>. Maemi also flooded of fields before the fall harvest, causing widespread damage to the rice crop. On <a href="Ulleungdo">Ulleungdo</a> island off the eastern coast, Maemi washed away the primary road and many houses, killing three. Residents there complained about the lack of advance warning.

Typhoon Maemi left about 1.47 million electric customers without power around the country, causing ₩12.9 billion (<a href="South%20Korean%20won">KRW</a>, $11.61 million USD) in damage to power companies. Widespread damage interrupted mobile and cell phone service. <a href="List%20of%20United%20States%20Army%20installations%20in%20South%20Korea">United States military bases</a> in the country sustained about $4.5 million in damage. Nationwide, Maemi destroyed about 5,000 houses and damaged 13,000 homes and businesses, leaving 25,000 people homeless. About 150 businesses in <a href="Gangwon%20Province%20%28South%20Korea%29">Gangwon Province</a> were destroyed by Typhoon Rusa in 2002, only to be destroyed again by Maemi when they were rebuilt. Insured damages from Maemi were estimated at ₩650 billion (KRW, $565 million), mostly property damage. The insured damage was over four times the amount of insured damage from Typhoon Rusa the year prior. Overall damage was estimated at ₩5.52 trillion (KRW, $4.8 billion USD). By comparison, this total was ₩2.52 trillion (KRW, $1.9 billion USD) less than Rusa; the discrepancy between the insured and overall damage was due to Maemi causing heavier industrial damage, while Rusa caused more damage overall. The storm killed 117 people throughout South Korea.

Although the typhoon prompted the PAGASA to hoist warnings—and in spite of initial concerns that the cyclone would enhance monsoonal rainfall—Maemi did not cause any damage in the Philippines.

While recurving east of Taiwan, Maemi dropped significant rainfall, peaking at in <a href="Yilan%20County%2C%20Taiwan">Ilan County</a>. The rains helped ease drought conditions and replenished parched reservoirs.

In North Korea, Maemi produced about 186 mm (7.32 in) of rainfall, although further details of the storm's effects there were unknown due to <a href="Censorship%20in%20North%20Korea">press censorship</a>.

Following the storm, South Korean <a href="President%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Korea">President</a> <a href="Roh%20Moo-hyun">Roh Moo-hyun</a> declared the entire of the country excluding <a href="Seoul">Seoul</a> and <a href="Incheon">Incheon</a> as special disaster areas, after touring the storm damage in Busan. The government provided <a href="tax%20break">tax break</a>s and allocated ₩1.4 trillion (KRW, $1.2 billion) in assistance to the affected residents, after an additional budget was passed in late September 2003. This included ₩100 billion (KRW, $90 million USD) in immediate funds for <a href="search%20and%20rescue">search and rescue</a> missions. After the storm, residents complained they did not receive adequate warning and not enough coastal areas were evacuated, which led to the high death toll. Widespread damage and continued flooding caused traffic jams in the days following the storm. A damaged rail line prompted operators to provide alternate bus service. Landslides throughout the country forced travelers to use alternate routes. By three days after the storm, most damaged roads and highways were reopened. About 33,000 members of the South Korean Army were deployed to assist in relief efforts, such as clearing roads and delivering aid to storm victims. Workers quickly restored power to 95% of customers within 24 hours. The government installed four new cranes for the Busan port, and assisted operators to ensure exports would not be delayed. Heavy crop damage caused fruit and vegetable prices to rise, and fish and crop exports rose 9.2% on average. The rice harvest was the lowest in 23 years, due to the storm and a government effort to limit production. To assist farmers, the government increased purchases in federal contracts. Three government-run banks provided low-rate loans for businesses damaged by the storm. Residual flooding from Maemi contributed to an outbreak of <a href="conjunctivitis">conjunctivitis</a> in the southern portion of the country. To prevent additional outbreaks, the Korean National Institute of Health sent 1,000 workers to storm-damaged areas. The <a href="Korea%20Exchange">Korea Stock Exchange</a> fell 1.8% due to fears that storm damage would disrupt exports.

For the month of September 2003, the <a href="Korea%20Electric%20Power%20Corporation">Korea Electric Power Corporation</a> waived electric bills for residents who lost their homes, and cut bills in half for residents and businesses who lost power. The South Korean government allowed companies to increase premiums for car insurance by 3.5% due to the widespread car damage. Due to storm damage, 34 companies were forced to temporarily close. Loss of production and disruptions were expected to subtract 0.5% from the forecast <a href="economic%20growth">economic growth</a> in 2003. The <a href="Consumer%20Confidence%20Index">Consumer Confidence Index</a> dropped to its lowest level in five years, largely due to the typhoon damage and weakened economic conditions. Following the strikes of Rusa and Maemi in consecutive years, the South Korean government worked on disaster management and mitigation programs. In March 2004, the government passed the "Emergency and Safety Management Basic Act", largely due to the storm as well as the <a href="Daegu%20metro%20fire">Daegu metro fire</a>, which effectively set up a nationwide emergency management system. The Gupo bridge damaged during the storm was repaired in 2007.

Although the South Korean government did not request international aid, several countries sent aid to the country. A few days after Maemi struck, the <a href="United%20States%20Agency%20for%20International%20Development">United States Agency for International Development</a> sent $50,000 (USD) to the Korean Red Cross. Later, the government of Japan sent ¥9.5 million ($85,000 USD) worth of supplies to South Korea, including sleeping mats, generators, and water units. Taiwan also provided $100,000 in aid. The <a href="Republic%20of%20Korea%20National%20Red%20Cross">Republic of Korea National Red Cross</a> utilized 700 volunteers and 200 staff members to distribute food and blankets to 8,190 houses, while local offices provided over 5,500 meals. Members of <a href="Food%20for%20the%20Hungry">Food for the Hungry</a> delivered food and clothing to storm-damaged residents in Masan.

As a result of the damage and deaths caused by the storm, the <a href="World%20Meteorological%20Organization">World Meteorological Organization</a> retired the name Maemi in 2006 and replaced it with <a href="Typhoon%20Mujigae">Mujigae</a>.

Acute myeloid leukemia

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a <a href="cancer">cancer</a> of the <a href="myeloid">myeloid</a> line of <a href="blood%20cells">blood cells</a>, characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal cells that build up in the <a href="bone%20marrow">bone marrow</a> and <a href="blood">blood</a> and interfere with <a href="haematopoiesis">normal blood cells</a>. Symptoms may include feeling tired, <a href="shortness%20of%20breath">shortness of breath</a>, easy bruising and bleeding, and increased risk of <a href="infection">infection</a>. Occasionally, spread may occur to the brain, skin, or gums. As an <a href="acute%20leukemia">acute leukemia</a>, AML progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.
<a href="Risk%20factors">Risk factors</a> include <a href="smoking">smoking</a>, previous <a href="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a> or <a href="radiation%20therapy">radiation therapy</a>, <a href="myelodysplastic%20syndrome">myelodysplastic syndrome</a>, and exposure to the chemical <a href="benzene">benzene</a>. The underlying mechanism involves replacement of normal bone marrow with <a href="leukemia%20cells">leukemia cells</a>, which results in a <a href="anemia">drop in red blood cell</a>s, <a href="thrombocytopenia">platelet</a>s, and normal <a href="leukopenia">white blood cell</a>s. Diagnosis is generally based on <a href="bone%20marrow%20aspiration">bone marrow aspiration</a> and specific <a href="blood%20test">blood test</a>s. AML has several subtypes for which treatments and outcomes may vary.
AML typically is initially treated with <a href="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>, with the aim of inducing <a href="remission%20%28medicine%29">remission</a>. People may then go on to receive additional chemotherapy, <a href="radiation%20therapy">radiation therapy</a>, or a <a href="hematopoietic%20stem%20cell%20transplant">stem cell transplant</a>. The specific <a href="genetic%20mutations">genetic mutations</a> present within the cancer cells may guide therapy, as well as determine how long that person is likely to survive. <a href="Arsenic%20trioxide">Arsenic trioxide</a> may be tried in cases that have recurred following usual treatments.
In 2015, AML affected about one million people and resulted in 147,000 deaths globally. It most commonly occurs in older adults. Males are affected more often than females. AML is curable in about 35% of people under 60 years old and 10% over 60 years old. Older people whose health is too poor for intensive chemotherapy have a <a href="median">typical</a> survival of 5–10 months. It accounts for roughly 1.8% of cancer deaths in the United States.
Most signs and symptoms of AML are caused by the replacement of normal blood cells with leukemic cells. A lack of normal white blood cell production makes people more susceptible to infections; while the leukemic cells themselves are derived from white blood cell precursors, they have no infection-fighting capacity. A drop in red blood cell count (<a href="anemia">anemia</a>) can cause fatigue, paleness, and shortness of breath. A lack of <a href="platelet">platelet</a>s can lead to easy bruising or bleeding with minor trauma.

The early signs of AML are often vague and nonspecific, and may be similar to those of <a href="influenza">influenza</a> or other common illnesses. Some generalized symptoms include <a href="fever">fever</a>, <a href="Fatigue%20%28physical%29">fatigue</a>, <a href="weight%20loss">weight loss</a> or <a href="loss%20of%20appetite">loss of appetite</a>, <a href="dyspnea">shortness of breath</a>, anemia, easy bruising or bleeding, <a href="petechia">petechia</a>e (flat, pin-head sized spots under the skin caused by bleeding), bone and joint pain, and persistent or frequent <a href="infections">infections</a>.

<a href="Splenomegaly">Enlargement of the spleen</a> may occur in AML, but it is typically mild and <a href="asymptomatic">asymptomatic</a>. <a href="lymphadenopathy">Lymph node swelling</a> is rare in AML, in contrast to <a href="acute%20lymphoblastic%20leukemia">acute lymphoblastic leukemia</a>. The skin is involved about 10% of the time in the form of <a href="leukemia%20cutis">leukemia cutis</a>. Rarely, <a href="Sweet%27s%20syndrome">Sweet's syndrome</a>, a <a href="paraneoplastic%20syndrome">paraneoplastic</a> inflammation of the skin, can occur with AML.

Some people with AML may experience swelling of the gums because of infiltration of leukemic cells into the gum tissue. Rarely, the first sign of leukemia may be the development of a solid leukemic mass or tumor outside of the <a href="bone%20marrow">bone marrow</a>, called a <a href="chloroma">chloroma</a>. Occasionally, a person may show <a href="asymptomatic">no symptoms</a>, and the leukemia may be discovered incidentally during a routine <a href="blood%20test">blood test</a>.

A number of risk factors for developing AML have been identified, including: other blood disorders, chemical exposures, ionizing radiation, and genetics.

"Preleukemic" blood disorders, such as <a href="myelodysplastic%20syndrome">myelodysplastic syndrome</a> (MDS) or <a href="myeloproliferative%20neoplasms">myeloproliferative neoplasms</a> (MPN), can evolve into AML; the exact risk depends on the type of MDS/MPN. The presence of asymptomatic <a href="clonal%20hematopoiesis">clonal hematopoiesis</a> also raises the risk of transformation into AML to 0.5–1.0% per year.

Exposure to <a href="chemotherapy">anticancer chemotherapy</a>, in particular <a href="alkylating%20antineoplastic%20agent">alkylating agents</a>, can increase the risk of subsequently developing AML. The risk is highest about three to five years after chemotherapy. Other chemotherapy agents, specifically <a href="Podophyllotoxin">epipodophyllotoxins</a> and <a href="anthracycline">anthracycline</a>s, have also been associated with treatment-related leukemias, which are often associated with specific chromosomal abnormalities in the leukemic cells.

Occupational chemical exposure to <a href="benzene">benzene</a> and other aromatic organic <a href="solvent">solvent</a>s is controversial as a cause of AML. Benzene and many of its derivatives are known to be <a href="carcinogenic">carcinogenic</a> "in vitro". While some studies have suggested a link between occupational exposure to benzene and increased risk of AML, others have suggested the attributable risk, if any, is slight.

High amounts of <a href="ionizing%20radiation">ionizing radiation</a> exposure can increase the risk of AML. <a href="Hibakusha">Survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a> had an increased rate of AML, as did <a href="radiologist">radiologist</a>s exposed to high levels of <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a>s prior to the adoption of modern radiation safety practices. People treated with ionizing radiation after treatment for <a href="prostate%20cancer">prostate cancer</a>, <a href="non-Hodgkin%20lymphoma">non-Hodgkin lymphoma</a>, <a href="lung%20cancer">lung cancer</a>, and <a href="breast%20cancer">breast cancer</a> have the highest chance of acquiring AML, but this increased risk returns to the background risk observed in the general population after 12 years.

A hereditary risk for AML appears to exist. Multiple cases of AML developing in a family at a rate higher than predicted by chance alone have been reported. Several <a href="congenital">congenital</a> conditions may increase the risk of leukemia; the most common is probably <a href="Down%20syndrome">Down syndrome</a>, which is associated with a 10- to 18-fold increase in the risk of AML. In a second example, <a href="Mutation%23By%20effect%20on%20function">inactivating mutation</a>s in one of the two parental "<a href="GATA2">GATA2</a>" <a href="gene">gene</a>s lead to a reduction, i.e. a <a href="haploinsufficiency">haploinsufficiency</a>, in the cellular levels of the gene's product, the <a href="GATA2">GATA2</a> <a href="transcription%20factor">transcription factor</a>, and thereby to a rare <a href="autosomal%20dominant">autosomal dominant</a> <a href="genetic%20disease">genetic disease</a>, <a href="GATA2%20deficiency">GATA2 deficiency</a>. This disease is associated with a highly variable set of disorders including an exceedingly high risk of developing AML. The specific genetic abnormalities causing AML usually vary between those who develop the disease as a child versus an adult. However, GATA2 deficiency-induced AML may first appear in children or adults.

The first clue to a diagnosis of AML is typically an abnormal result on a <a href="complete%20blood%20count">complete blood count</a>. While an excess of abnormal white blood cells (<a href="leukocytosis">leukocytosis</a>) is a common finding with the leukemia, and leukemic blasts are sometimes seen, AML can also present with isolated decreases in <a href="platelet">platelet</a>s, <a href="red%20blood%20cell">red blood cell</a>s, or even with a low white blood cell count (<a href="leukopenia">leukopenia</a>). While a presumptive diagnosis of AML can be made by examination of the <a href="Blood%20film">peripheral blood smear</a> when there are circulating leukemic blasts, a definitive diagnosis usually requires an adequate <a href="bone%20marrow%20examination">bone marrow aspiration and biopsy</a> as well as ruling out <a href="Vitamin%20B12%20deficiency%20anemia">pernicious anemia</a> (Vitamin B12 deficiency), <a href="Folate%20deficiency">folic acid deficiency</a> and <a href="copper%20deficiency">copper deficiency</a>.

Marrow or blood is examined under <a href="light%20microscopy">light microscopy</a>, as well as <a href="flow%20cytometry">flow cytometry</a>, to diagnose the presence of leukemia, to differentiate AML from other types of leukemia (e.g. <a href="acute%20lymphoblastic%20leukemia">acute lymphoblastic leukemia</a> – ALL), and to classify the subtype of disease. A sample of marrow or blood is typically also tested for <a href="Chromosome%20abnormality">chromosomal abnormalities</a> by routine <a href="cytogenetics">cytogenetics</a> or <a href="fluorescent%20in%20situ%20hybridization">fluorescent "in situ" hybridization</a>. Genetic studies may also be performed to look for specific mutations in genes such as "<a href="FLT3">FLT3</a>", <a href="nucleophosmin">nucleophosmin</a>, and "<a href="CD117">KIT</a>", which may influence the outcome of the disease.

Cytochemical stains on blood and bone marrow smears are helpful in the distinction of AML from ALL, and in subclassification of AML. The combination of a myeloperoxidase or Sudan black stain and a nonspecific esterase stain will provide the desired information in most cases. The myeloperoxidase or Sudan black reactions are most useful in establishing the identity of AML and distinguishing it from ALL. The nonspecific esterase stain is used to identify a monocytic component in AMLs and to distinguish a poorly differentiated monoblastic leukemia from ALL.

The diagnosis and classification of AML can be challenging, and should be performed by a qualified <a href="hematopathologist">hematopathologist</a> or <a href="hematologist">hematologist</a>. In straightforward cases, the presence of certain morphologic features (such as <a href="Auer%20rods">Auer rods</a>) or specific flow cytometry results can distinguish AML from other leukemias; however, in the absence of such features, diagnosis may be more difficult.

The two most commonly used classification schemata for AML are the older French-American-British (FAB) system and the newer <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) system. According to the widely used WHO criteria, the diagnosis of AML is established by demonstrating involvement of more than 20% of the blood and/or bone marrow by leukemic <a href="myeloblast">myeloblast</a>s, except in the three best prognosis forms of <a href="acute%20myeloid%20leukemia%20with%20recurrent%20genetic%20abnormalities">acute myeloid leukemia with recurrent genetic abnormalities</a> (t(8;21), inv(16), and t(15;17)) in which the presence of the genetic abnormality is diagnostic irrespective of blast percent. The French–American–British (FAB) classification is a bit more stringent, requiring a blast percentage of at least 30% in bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB) for the diagnosis of AML. AML must be carefully differentiated from "preleukemic" conditions such as <a href="myelodysplastic%20syndrome">myelodysplastic</a> or <a href="myeloproliferative%20syndrome">myeloproliferative</a> syndromes, which are treated differently.

Because <a href="acute%20promyelocytic%20leukemia">acute promyelocytic leukemia</a> (APL) has the highest curability and requires a unique form of treatment, it is important to quickly establish or exclude the diagnosis of this subtype of leukemia. Fluorescent "in situ" hybridization performed on blood or bone marrow is often used for this purpose, as it readily identifies the <a href="chromosomal%20translocation">chromosomal translocation</a> [t(15;17)(q22;q12);] that characterizes APL. There is also a need to molecularly detect the presence of PML/RARA fusion protein, which is an oncogenic product of that translocation.

The WHO 2008 classification of acute myeloid leukemia attempts to be more clinically useful and to produce more meaningful prognostic information than the FAB criteria. Each of the WHO categories contains numerous descriptive subcategories of interest to the <a href="hematopathologist">hematopathologist</a> and <a href="oncologist">oncologist</a>; however, most of the clinically significant information in the WHO schema is communicated via categorization into one of the subtypes listed below.

The WHO subtypes of AML are:

Acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage (also known as mixed phenotype or <a href="biphenotypic%20acute%20leukemia">biphenotypic acute leukemia</a>) occur when the leukemic cells can not be classified as either myeloid or lymphoid cells, or where both types of cells are present.

The <a href="French-American-British%20classification">French-American-British (FAB) classification</a> system divides AML into eight subtypes, M0 through to M7, based on the type of cell from which the leukemia developed and its degree of maturity. This is done by examining the appearance of the <a href="Malignant">malignant cells</a> with <a href="light%20microscopy">light microscopy</a> and/or by using <a href="cytogenetics">cytogenetics</a> to characterize any underlying chromosomal abnormalities. The subtypes have varying prognoses and responses to therapy. Although the WHO classification (see above) may be more useful, the FAB system is still widely used.

Six FAB subtypes (M1 through to M6) were initially proposed in 1976, although later revisions added M7 in 1985 and M0 in 1987.

The morphologic subtypes of AML also include rare types not included in the FAB system, such as <a href="acute%20basophilic%20leukemia">acute basophilic leukemia</a>, which was proposed as a ninth subtype, M8, in 1999.

The malignant cell in AML is the <a href="myeloblast">myeloblast</a>. In normal <a href="haematopoiesis">hematopoiesis</a>, the myeloblast is an immature precursor of <a href="myeloid">myeloid</a> white blood cells; a normal myeloblast will gradually mature into a mature white blood cell. In AML, though, a single myeloblast accumulates genetic changes which "freeze" the cell in its immature state and prevent <a href="cellular%20differentiation">differentiation</a>. Such a mutation alone does not cause leukemia; however, when such a "differentiation arrest" is <a href="Knudson%20hypothesis">combined with other mutations</a> which disrupt genes controlling <a href="cell%20growth">proliferation</a>, the result is the uncontrolled growth of an immature clone of cells, leading to the clinical entity of AML.

Much of the diversity and heterogeneity of AML is because leukemic transformation can occur at a number of different steps along the differentiation pathway. Modern classification schemes for AML recognize that the characteristics and behavior of the leukemic cell (and the leukemia) may depend on the stage at which differentiation was halted.

Specific <a href="cytogenetics">cytogenetic</a> abnormalities can be found in many people with AML; the types of chromosomal abnormalities often have <a href="prognosis">prognostic</a> significance. The chromosomal <a href="translocations">translocations</a> encode abnormal fusion <a href="proteins">proteins</a>, usually <a href="transcription%20factors">transcription factors</a> whose altered properties may cause the "differentiation arrest". For example, in acute promyelocytic leukemia, the t(15;17) translocation produces a PML-RARα <a href="fusion%20protein">fusion protein</a> which binds to the <a href="retinoic%20acid">retinoic acid</a> receptor element in the promoters of several myeloid-specific genes and inhibits myeloid differentiation.

The <a href="Medical%20sign">clinical signs</a> and symptoms of AML result from the growth of leukemic clone cells, which tends to displace or interfere with the development of normal blood cells in the bone marrow. This leads to <a href="neutropenia">neutropenia</a>, <a href="anemia">anemia</a>, and <a href="thrombocytopenia">thrombocytopenia</a>. The symptoms of AML are, in turn, often due to the low numbers of these normal blood elements. In rare cases, people with AML can develop a <a href="chloroma">chloroma</a>, or solid tumor of leukemic cells outside the bone marrow, which can cause various symptoms depending on its location.

An important pathophysiological mechanism of leukemogenesis in AML is the epigenetic induction of dedifferentiation by genetic mutations that alter the function of epigenetic enzymes, such as the DNA demethylase TET2 and the metabolic enzymes IDH1 and IDH2, which lead to the generation of a novel oncometabolite, "D"-2-hydroxyglutarate, which inhibits the activity of epigenetic enzymes such as TET2. The hypothesis is that such epigenetic mutations lead to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes and/or the activation of proto-oncogenes.

First-line treatment of AML consists primarily of <a href="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>, and is divided into two phases: induction and postremission (or consolidation) therapy. The goal of induction therapy is to achieve a complete remission by reducing the number of leukemic cells to an undetectable level; the goal of consolidation therapy is to eliminate any residual undetectable disease and achieve a cure. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is usually considered if induction chemotherapy fails or after a person relapses, although transplantation is also sometimes used as front-line therapy for people with high-risk disease. Efforts to use <a href="tyrosine-kinase%20inhibitor">tyrosine kinase inhibitors</a> in AML continue.

All FAB subtypes except M3 are usually given <a href="induction%20chemotherapy">induction chemotherapy</a> with <a href="cytarabine">cytarabine</a> (ara-C) and an <a href="anthracycline">anthracycline</a> (most often <a href="daunorubicin">daunorubicin</a>). This induction chemotherapy regimen is known as "<a href="7%2B3%20%28chemotherapy%29">7+3</a>" (or "3+7"), because the cytarabine is given as a continuous IV infusion for seven consecutive days while the <a href="anthracycline">anthracycline</a> is given for three consecutive days as an <a href="IV%20push">IV push</a>. Up to 70% of people with AML will achieve a remission with this protocol. Other alternative induction regimens, including <a href="R-HDAC">high-dose cytarabine</a> alone, <a href="FLAG%20%28chemotherapy%29">FLAG-like regimens</a> or investigational agents, may also be used. Because of the toxic effects of therapy, including <a href="myelosuppression">myelosuppression</a> and an increased risk of infection, induction chemotherapy may not be offered to the very elderly, and the options may include less intense chemotherapy or <a href="palliative%20care">palliative care</a>.

The M3 subtype of AML, also known as <a href="acute%20promyelocytic%20leukemia">acute promyelocytic leukemia</a> (APL), is almost universally treated with the drug all-"trans"-retinoic acid (<a href="ATRA">ATRA</a>) in addition to induction chemotherapy, usually an anthracycline. Care must be taken to prevent disseminated intravascular coagulation (<a href="Disseminated%20intravascular%20coagulation">DIC</a>), complicating the treatment of APL when the promyelocytes release the contents of their granules into the peripheral circulation. APL is eminently curable, with well-documented treatment protocols.

The goal of the induction phase is to reach a complete remission. Complete remission does not mean the disease has been cured; rather, it signifies no disease can be detected with available diagnostic methods. Complete remission is obtained in about 50%–75% of newly diagnosed adults, although this may vary based on the prognostic factors described above. The length of remission depends on the prognostic features of the original leukemia. In general, all remissions will fail without additional consolidation therapy.

Even after complete remission is achieved, leukemic cells likely remain in numbers too small to be detected with current diagnostic techniques. If no further postremission or consolidation therapy is given, almost all people with AML will eventually relapse. Therefore, more therapy is necessary to eliminate nondetectable disease and prevent relapse — that is, to achieve a cure.

The specific type of postremission therapy is individualized based on a person's prognostic factors (see above) and general health. For good-prognosis leukemias (i.e. inv(16), t(8;21), and t(15;17)), people will typically undergo an additional three to five courses of intensive chemotherapy, known as consolidation chemotherapy. For people at high risk of relapse (e.g. those with high-risk cytogenetics, underlying MDS, or therapy-related AML), <a href="bone%20marrow%20transplant">allogeneic stem cell transplantation</a> is usually recommended if the person is able to tolerate a transplant and has a suitable donor. The best postremission therapy for intermediate-risk AML (normal cytogenetics or cytogenetic changes not falling into good-risk or high-risk groups) is less clear and depends on the specific situation, including the age and overall health of the person, the person's values, and whether a suitable <a href="stem%20cell">stem cell</a> donor is available.

For people who are not eligible for a stem cell transplant, immunotherapy with a combination of histamine dihydrochloride (<a href="Ceplene">Ceplene</a>) and <a href="interleukin%202">interleukin 2</a> (Proleukin) after the completion of consolidation has been shown to reduce the absolute relapse risk by 14%, translating to a 50% increase in the likelihood of maintained remission.

For people with relapsed AML, the only proven potentially curative therapy is a <a href="hematopoietic%20stem%20cell%20transplant">hematopoietic stem cell transplant</a>, if one has not already been performed. In 2000, the <a href="monoclonal%20antibody">monoclonal antibody</a>-linked cytotoxic agent <a href="gemtuzumab%20ozogamicin">gemtuzumab ozogamicin</a> (Mylotarg) was approved in the United States for people aged more than 60 years with relapsed AML who are not candidates for high-dose chemotherapy. This drug was voluntarily withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer, Pfizer in 2010, but newer data aided its reintroduction in 2017.

Since treatment options for relapsed AML are so limited, <a href="palliative%20care">palliative care</a> or enrollment in a <a href="clinical%20trial">clinical trial</a> may be offered.

For relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), <a href="arsenic%20trioxide">arsenic trioxide</a> is approved by the <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">US FDA</a>. Like ATRA, arsenic trioxide does not work with other subtypes of AML.

Acute myeloid leukemia is a curable disease; the chance of cure for a specific person depends on a number of prognostic factors.

The single most important prognostic factor in AML is <a href="cytogenetics">cytogenetics</a>, or the chromosomal structure of the leukemic cell. Certain cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with very good outcomes (for example, the (15;17) translocation in acute promyelocytic leukemia). About half of people with AML have "normal" cytogenetics; they fall into an intermediate risk group. A number of other cytogenetic abnormalities are known to associate with a poor prognosis and a high risk of relapse after treatment.

The first publication to address cytogenetics and prognosis was the MRC trial of 1998:
Later, the <a href="Southwest%20Oncology%20Group">Southwest Oncology Group</a> and <a href="Eastern%20Cooperative%20Oncology%20Group">Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group</a> and, later still, <a href="Cancer%20and%20Leukemia%20Group%20B">Cancer and Leukemia Group B</a> published other, mostly overlapping lists of cytogenetics prognostication in leukemia.

AML which arises from a pre-existing <a href="myelodysplastic%20syndrome">myelodysplastic syndrome</a> (MDS) or <a href="myeloproliferative%20disease">myeloproliferative disease</a> (so-called secondary AML) has a worse <a href="prognosis">prognosis</a>, as does treatment-related AML arising after chemotherapy for another previous malignancy. Both of these entities are associated with a high rate of unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities.

In some studies, age >60 years and elevated <a href="lactate%20dehydrogenase">lactate dehydrogenase</a> level were also associated with poorer outcomes. As with most forms of cancer, <a href="performance%20status">performance status</a> (i.e. the general physical condition and activity level of the person) plays a major role in prognosis as well.

The five-year survival rate is about 25% overall. Age plays a significant role: 40% of people under the age of 60, but just 10% of those over it, live five years after diagnosis.

A large number of molecular alterations are under study for their prognostic impact in AML. However, only "FLT3-ITD", "NPM1", "CEBPA" and "c-KIT" are currently included in validated international risk stratification schema. These are expected to increase rapidly in the near future. "<a href="FLT3">FLT3</a>" internal tandem duplications (ITDs) have been shown to confer a poorer prognosis in AML with normal cytogenetics. Several <a href="FLT3%20inhibitor">FLT3 inhibitor</a>s have undergone clinical trials, with mixed results. Two other mutations – "<a href="NPM1">NPM1</a>" and biallelic "<a href="CEBPA">CEBPA</a>" are associated with improved outcomes, especially in people with normal cytogenetics and are used in current risk stratification algorithms.

Researchers are investigating the clinical significance of "<a href="CD117">c-KIT</a>" mutations in AML. These are prevalent, and potentially clinically relevant because of the availability of <a href="tyrosine%20kinase%20inhibitors">tyrosine kinase inhibitors</a>, such as <a href="imatinib">imatinib</a> and <a href="sunitinib">sunitinib</a> that can block the activity of "c-KIT" pharmacologically. It is expected that additional markers (e.g., "<a href="RUNX1">RUNX1</a>", "<a href="ASXL1">ASXL1</a>", and "<a href="TP53">TP53</a>") that have consistently been associated with an inferior outcome will soon be included in these recommendations. The prognostic importance of other mutated genes (e.g., "<a href="DNMT3A">DNMT3A</a>", "<a href="IDH1">IDH1</a>", "<a href="IDH2">IDH2</a>") is less clear.

Cure rates in clinical trials have ranged from 20–45%; although clinical trials often include only younger people and those able to tolerate aggressive therapies. The overall cure rate for all people with AML (including the elderly and those unable to tolerate aggressive therapy) is likely lower. Cure rates for promyelocytic leukemia can be as high as 98%.

Relapse is common, and the prognosis is poor. Long-term survival after a relapse is so rare that the only known case was submitted to the Catholic Church as evidence of a <a href="miracle">miracle</a> attributed to <a href="Marie-Marguerite%20d%27Youville">Marie-Marguerite d'Youville</a>.

Acute myeloid leukemia is a relatively rare cancer. There are approximately 10,500 new cases each year in the United States, and the <a href="incidence%20%28epidemiology%29">incidence</a> rate has remained stable from 1995 through 2005. AML accounts for 1.2% of all cancer deaths in the United States.

The incidence of AML increases with age; the median age at diagnosis is 63 years. AML accounts for about 90% of all acute leukemias in adults, but is rare in children. The rate of "therapy-related AML" (that is, AML caused by previous chemotherapy) is rising; therapy-related disease currently accounts for about 10–20% of all cases of AML. AML is slightly more common in men, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.3:1.

There is some geographic variation in the incidence of AML. In adults, the highest rates are seen in North America, Europe, and Oceania, while adult AML is rarer in Asia and Latin America. In contrast, childhood AML is less common in North America and India than in other parts of Asia. These differences may be due to <a href="population%20genetics">population genetics</a>, <a href="environmental%20factor">environmental factor</a>s, or a combination of the two.

AML accounts for 34% of all leukemia cases in the UK, and around 2,900 people were diagnosed with the disease in 2011.

The first published description of a case of leukemia in medical literature dates to 1827, when French physician <a href="Alfred-Armand-Louis-Marie%20Velpeau">Alfred-Armand-Louis-Marie Velpeau</a> described a 63-year-old florist who developed an illness characterized by fever, weakness, <a href="nephrolithiasis">urinary stones</a>, and substantial <a href="hepatosplenomegaly">enlargement of the liver and spleen</a>. Velpeau noted the blood of this person had a consistency "like gruel", and speculated the appearance of the blood was due to white corpuscles. In 1845, a series of people who died with enlarged spleens and changes in the "colors and consistencies of their blood" was reported by the <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>-based <a href="pathologist">pathologist</a> J.H. Bennett; he used the term "leucocythemia" to describe this pathological condition.

The term "leukemia" was coined by <a href="Rudolf%20Virchow">Rudolf Virchow</a>, the renowned German <a href="pathologist">pathologist</a>, in 1856. As a pioneer in the use of the <a href="light%20microscope">light microscope</a> in pathology, Virchow was the first to describe the abnormal excess of white blood cells in people with the clinical syndrome described by Velpeau and Bennett. As Virchow was uncertain of the <a href="etiology">etiology</a> of the white blood cell excess, he used the purely descriptive term "leukemia" (Greek: "white blood") to refer to the condition.

Further advances in the understanding of acute myeloid leukemia occurred rapidly with the development of new technology. In 1877, <a href="Paul%20Ehrlich">Paul Ehrlich</a> developed a technique of <a href="staining%20%28biology%29">staining</a> blood films which allowed him to describe in detail normal and abnormal white blood cells. <a href="Wilhelm%20Ebstein">Wilhelm Ebstein</a> introduced the term "acute leukemia" in 1889 to differentiate rapidly progressive and fatal leukemias from the more <a href="Indolent%20condition">indolent</a> <a href="chronic%20leukemia">chronic leukemia</a>s. The term "myeloid" was coined by <a href="Franz%20Ernst%20Christian%20Neumann">Franz Ernst Christian Neumann</a> in 1869, as he was the first to recognize white blood cells were made in the bone marrow (<a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a>: µυєλός, "myelos" = (bone) marrow) as opposed to the <a href="spleen">spleen</a>. The technique of <a href="bone%20marrow%20examination">bone marrow examination</a> to diagnose leukemia was first described in 1879 by Mosler. Finally, in 1900, the <a href="myeloblast">myeloblast</a>, which is the malignant cell in AML, was characterized by <a href="Otto%20Naegeli">Otto Naegeli</a>, who divided the leukemias into myeloid and lymphocytic.

In 2008, AML became the first cancer genome to be fully <a href="DNA%20sequencing">sequenced</a>. DNA extracted from leukemic cells were compared to unaffected skin. The leukemic cells contained acquired mutations in several genes that had not previously been associated with the disease.

Leukemia is rarely associated with pregnancy, affecting only about 1 in 10,000 pregnant women. How it is handled depends primarily on the type of leukemia. Acute leukemias normally require prompt, aggressive treatment, despite significant risks of <a href="miscarriage">pregnancy loss</a> and <a href="birth%20defect">birth defect</a>s, especially if chemotherapy is given during the developmentally sensitive <a href="first%20trimester">first trimester</a>.

Thistle, Utah

Thistle is a <a href="ghost%20town">ghost town</a> in <a href="Spanish%20Fork%20River">Spanish Fork Canyon</a> in southeastern <a href="Utah%20County%2C%20Utah">Utah County</a>, <a href="Utah">Utah</a>, <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. During the era of <a href="steam%20locomotive">steam locomotive</a>s, the town's primary industry was servicing trains for the <a href="Denver%20and%20Rio%20Grande%20Western%20Railroad">Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad</a> (often shortened to D&RG, D&RGW, or Rio Grande). The fortunes of the town were closely linked with those of the railroad until the changeover to <a href="diesel%20locomotives">diesel locomotives</a>, when the town started to decline.

In April 1983, a massive <a href="landslide">landslide</a> (specifically a complex <a href="earthflow">earthflow</a>) dammed the <a href="Spanish%20Fork%20River">Spanish Fork River</a>. The residents were evacuated as nearly of water backed up, flooding the town. Thistle was destroyed; only a few structures were left partially standing. Federal and state government agencies have said this was the most costly landslide in United States history, the economic consequences of which affected the entire region. The landslide resulted in the first presidentially declared <a href="disaster%20area">disaster area</a> in Utah.

<a href="U.S.%20Route%206%20in%20Utah">U.S. Route 6</a> (US‑6), <a href="U.S.%20Route%2089%20in%20Utah">U.S. Route 89</a> (US‑89) and the <a href="railroad">railroad</a> (now part of <a href="Union%20Pacific%20Railroad">Union Pacific Railroad</a>'s <a href="Central%20Corridor%20%28Union%20Pacific%20Railroad%29">Central Corridor</a>) were closed for several months, until they were rebuilt on a higher alignment overlooking the area. The remains of Thistle are visible from a <a href="Scenic%20viewpoint">view area</a> along US‑89 or from the "<a href="California%20Zephyr">California Zephyr</a>" passenger train.

Thistle is about southeast of <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City">Salt Lake City</a>, at the confluence of the two primary tributaries to the Spanish Fork River, Thistle Creek and Soldier Creek. This confluence, at an elevation of , is also the junction of two naturally formed routes across the mountains of central Utah. The primary route crosses the <a href="Wasatch%20Range">Wasatch Mountains</a>, via the <a href="Wasatch%20Plateau">Wasatch Plateau</a> and <a href="Soldier%20Summit">Soldier Summit</a>. This route was carved by the tributaries of the <a href="Price%20River">Price River</a> on the eastern side of the mountains and the Spanish Fork River on the west. In addition, Thistle Creek provides a route south from Thistle towards the communities of the <a href="Sanpete%20Valley">Sanpete</a> and <a href="Sevier%20Valley">Sevier</a> valleys. The Spanish Fork River flows northwest from Thistle, towards and through the city of <a href="Spanish%20Fork%2C%20Utah">Spanish Fork</a>, before reaching <a href="Utah%20Lake">Utah Lake</a>.

These natural paths have provided the route of several transcontinental trails, highways and railroads since their discovery. The named transportation arteries passing through Thistle include: US‑6 (originally numbered <a href="U.S.%20Route%2050%20in%20Utah">US‑50</a>), US‑89, the <a href="Denver%20and%20Rio%20Grande%20Western%20Railroad">Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad</a>'s <a href="Utah%20Division%20%28D%26amp%3BRGW%29">Utah Division</a> (now part of <a href="Union%20Pacific%20Railroad">Union Pacific Railroad</a>'s <a href="Central%20Corridor%20%28Union%20Pacific%20Railroad%29">Central Corridor</a>) and D&RGW's <a href="Marysvale%20Branch">Marysvale Branch</a> line (abandoned because of the landslide).

The trade route on which Thistle lies was used by <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native American</a> tribes before the arrival of European settlers; two <a href="Ute%20Indian">Ute</a> chiefs, <a href="Tabby-To-Kwanah">Taby</a> and <a href="Chief%20Peteetneet">Peteetneet</a>, led seasonal migrations through the canyon each spring and fall. The first recorded journey by Europeans to modern Thistle was the <a href="Dominguez%E2%80%93Escalante%20Expedition">Dominguez–Escalante Expedition</a>, which was escorted through the territory by Indian guides. A small group of Utes inhabiting the canyon frequently clashed with newcomers, and as a result were forcibly relocated in the 1870s.
Most of Thistle's residents were railroad employees sent to live in the town, but there were some who had settled before the railroads arrived. The first Europeans were part of the <a href="Mormon%20migration%20to%20Utah">Mormon migration to Utah</a>, and the first of these was the Pace family, who migrated from <a href="Nauvoo%2C%20Illinois">Nauvoo</a>, <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>, reaching Thistle in 1848. Fifth-generation descendants of the Pace settlers continued to operate a family-owned <a href="cattle%20ranch">cattle ranch</a> until the town was evacuated. Other settlers included Mormons who originally settled elsewhere in Utah but subsequently arrived to <a href="homestead%20principle">homestead</a> fertile ground on Billies Mountain, on the north wall of the canyon. Among them was the mountain's presumed namesake, William Johnson. Homesteading was practiced in Thistle until the early 1900s. Until the arrival of the railroads, the town's economy was based mainly on farming and ranching, although there was also some mining activity in the region, including a vein of <a href="asphaltum">asphaltum</a> that was mined between 1892 and 1914.

The first railroad track laid through Thistle was a <a href="narrow%20gauge">narrow-gauge</a> spur line servicing coal mines near today's <a href="Scofield%20Reservoir">Scofield Reservoir</a>, built in 1878 by the <a href="Utah%20and%20Pleasant%20Valley%20Railway">Utah and Pleasant Valley Railway</a>. By 1890, the Denver and Rio Grande Western, which acquired the line in a foreclosure sale in 1882, had rebuilt the line to <a href="standard%20gauge">standard gauge</a>. The D&RGW connected this line with one they had built west from <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>, completing a link from Salt Lake City to <a href="Denver">Denver</a>.

The railroad built several facilities in Thistle to service and prepare trains for the change in <a href="grade%20%28slope%29">grade</a> and curvature of the line. The railroad placed <a href="helper%20engine">helper engine</a>s on eastbound trains at Thistle for the ascent to Soldier Summit. The town provided a meal service for the trains until the use of on-board <a href="dining%20car">dining car</a>s eliminated the need for meal stops.
Thistle saw more rail traffic with the construction of the Marysvale Branch line. This line branched from the main at Thistle, following modern US‑89 towards mines near <a href="Marysvale%2C%20Utah">Marysvale</a>. Another line through Thistle, paralleling the D&RGW main, was built by the <a href="Utah%20Railway">Utah Railway</a>. The two lines were later combined into a dual-track main line, as part of a <a href="trackage%20rights">trackage rights</a> agreement between the two companies.

Rail traffic through Thistle continued to increase as the Rio Grande cooperated with connecting railroads, making the rail line through Thistle a <a href="bridge%20line">bridge line</a> for transcontinental rail traffic. The growth of Thistle was closely tied to the success of the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad throughout the era of <a href="steam%20locomotive">steam locomotive</a>s.

At its peak, around 1917, Thistle had about 600 residents. The town's railroad infrastructure included a five-stall <a href="Railway%20roundhouse">roundhouse</a>, depot, <a href="machine%20shop">machine shop</a>, and structures to restock passing trains with sand, coal and water. Non-railroad infrastructure included general stores, a post office, barber shop, saloon, pool hall, bakeries and restaurants. The largest building was a two-story schoolhouse, built in 1911.

In the 1950s, the Denver & Rio Grande Western began to phase out steam locomotives in favor of <a href="diesel%20locomotive">diesel locomotive</a>s, which require less maintenance. With the change in technology, Thistle faded in importance. Gradually the town shrank in population; the passenger depot was torn down in 1972 and the post office closed in 1974. By 1983, only a few families remained in Thistle.

Rio Grande maintenance personnel began noticing unstable ground downstream from Thistle years before the landslide occurred. Maintenance crews repaired the track on several occasions, but they did not fully investigate the problem. Beginning with the remnants of <a href="Hurricane%20Olivia%20%281982%29">Hurricane Olivia</a>, the autumn and winter of 1982–83 featured record-breaking snow and rainfall. As the spring thaw melted the winter snow, the mountains in the area became saturated with water.

By April 1983, track deformation was a serious issue. On April 13, the division track master flew to Denver to explain the situation at a specially-called staff meeting. On the same day, a <a href="Utah%20Highway%20Patrol">Utah Highway Patrol</a> officer struck a newly created buckle in the highway that threw him against the roof of his vehicle. By the end of the day, a full maintenance crew was struggling to keep US‑6/US‑89 open. All trains were limited to speeds less than , and were accompanied by maintenance personnel who had to continually work to keep the tracks in line. The last train to pass through downtown Thistle was the westbound "<a href="Rio%20Grande%20Zephyr">Rio Grande Zephyr</a>", on April 14, 1983 at about 8:30 p.m. That night, both US‑6/US‑89 and the rail line were closed. One westbound freight train that had already left Denver was turned back. All through trains between Denver and Salt Lake City were rerouted to Union Pacific Railroad's <a href="Overland%20Route%20%28Union%20Pacific%20Railroad%29">Overland Route</a> through <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>. By April 16, the tracks were completely buried and a voluntary evacuation order was issued for the town. 

On April 17, a final attempt to keep the landslide from blocking the flow of the river failed. That day, the <a href="Utah%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Utah Department of Transportation</a> and the Rio Grande announced plans to abandon the existing transportation arteries and build new corridors. Both the highway and railroad would be re-routed by blasting a path scaling the north wall of Spanish Fork Canyon. The new arteries would pass the slide by dynamiting through Billies Mountain, also along the north canyon wall. Engineers estimated the dam created by the toe of the landslide would eventually reach tall. The evacuation order was changed from voluntary to mandatory. Volunteers transported as many people and belongings as possible to the small town of <a href="Birdseye%2C%20Utah">Birdseye</a>, about south. Most residents were able to recover only a fraction of their belongings; some had less than two hours' notice before the water reached their house. Thistle's oldest resident celebrated her 90th birthday at the evacuation center in Birdseye. By the 18th, the waterline had reached the rooftops of the 22 previously occupied houses. By the 19th, an entire mountain was moving at about per hour, and US‑6/US‑89 was buried by of soil.
Governor <a href="Scott%20M.%20Matheson%20%28Utah%20governor%29">Scott Matheson</a> requested federal aid to deal with the situation. After a visit to the area by the director of the <a href="Federal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a>, U.S. president <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> issued the first presidential <a href="disaster%20area">disaster area</a> declaration for the state of Utah. The landslide eventually formed a dam that created a lake long and over deep. Concerned the dam could fail, the state of Utah decided to build a tunnel to re-route the flow of the Spanish Fork River. The residents of downstream <a href="Spanish%20Fork%2C%20Utah">Spanish Fork</a> were told to be prepared to evacuate. Engineers estimated that if the dam failed, they would have 30 to 45 minutes notice before the water reached the city.

Thistle was almost completely destroyed. Most wooden buildings were carried away in the floodwaters. The state installed a temporary pumping station to prevent the lake from overflowing the dam; patrol boats skimmed up the floating remains of the town to prevent the debris from blocking the pumps. Most remains were either naturally deposited or placed on the eastern shore of the lake.

By autumn, the tunnels to restore the flow of the river and drain the lake were operational. Shortly after, debates between former residents, neighboring residents, and government agencies began on what to do with the dam created by the landslide; some wanted to make the lake permanent. The state engineer commissioned a study to determine if the landslide dam could be used to retain water; it recommended building a new dam upstream from the landslide, rather than attempting engineering work on the landslide dam.

In the years following, the former residents of Thistle filed various lawsuits to recover their losses. In one, they claimed that their property was taken to rebuild the road and railroad without just compensation. Another lawsuit claimed negligence on the part of the D&RGW. The residents argued that the railroad's maintenance workers knew the ground was unstable; however, they only repaired the track. The residents contended the slide could have been prevented by using a water drainage system to relieve pressure at the head of the unstable area. They further contended that such a system could have been put in place had the railroad thoroughly investigated the problem upon first noticing it. The engineering firm employed by the Rio Grande said that their studies indicated the crown of the landslide was about above the level of the tracks, and that the Rio Grande did not know the true size of the unstable area until the slide was in motion. A jury absolved the D&RGW of responsibility. The plaintiffs appealed the decision, and a second trial in 1993 resulted in a $1.1 million award for the landowners (equivalent to $ million in 2019). The D&RGW filed suit against the Utah Railway over sharing the costs from the landslide. The Utah Railway had an ownership interest in the line, based on a track-sharing agreement.

The landslide closed the main railroad for three months, and US‑6 and US‑89 for eight months, during which time transportation between the communities of eastern and southeastern Utah and the rest of the state was substantially impaired. Security for the isolated part of Utah County was temporarily assigned to the <a href="Utah%20Highway%20Patrol">Utah Highway Patrol</a>.

The economic effects of the closure of these transportation arteries were felt throughout the western United States; the closure devastated rural Utah. The operations of coal mines, uranium mines, turkey farms, animal feed companies, <a href="gypsum">gypsum</a> mines, and cement and clay factories were severely impacted. At least two trucking firms and one oil-producing firm suspended or ceased operations. Southeastern Utah's tourism industry suffered without access for visitors from the north and west. Some people who lived and worked on opposite sides of the landslide area suddenly had commutes exceeding . The highway patrol temporarily closed a <a href="weigh%20station">weigh station</a> at Peerless (a location along the US‑6 corridor near <a href="Helper%2C%20Utah">Helper</a>) and built a temporary weigh station near <a href="Salina%2C%20Utah">Salina</a> (along <a href="Interstate%2070%20in%20Utah">I‑70</a> about south of Thistle), which saw a sudden increase in truck traffic. The highway patrol estimated the temporary facilities inspected 57,000 trucks and made 80 arrests.

The direct cost of the landslide was estimated at $200 million (equivalent to $ million in 2019). However, some estimates of the total cost reached as high as $400 million (equivalent to $ million in 2019). The D&RGW estimated the slide cost them $80 million in lost revenue (equivalent to $ million in 2019), averaging $1 million for each day that the tracks were out-of-service. This figure included $19 million in payments to the <a href="Union%20Pacific">Union Pacific</a> for the use of their lines. The <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a> and the state of Utah have called the Thistle landslide the most costly ever in the United States.

To expedite construction, the railroad had crews in Utah focused on grading the new path and boring a tunnel, while crews in Colorado built track segments that were transported to site. On July 4, 1983, at 3:05 p.m., safety inspectors declared the line ready for operation. At 3:12 p.m., the <a href="centralized%20traffic%20control">centralized traffic control</a> signals gave a green light to the first train to pass through the Thistle area since the slide began, an eastbound freight train coming from the <a href="Southern%20Pacific%20Railroad">Southern Pacific Railroad</a> at <a href="Ogden%2C%20Utah">Ogden</a>, destined for <a href="Herington%2C%20Kansas">Herington</a>, <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a>. Although the line's re-opening on <a href="Independence%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">Independence Day</a> was coincidental, the first train became part of the local holiday celebrations. The first passenger train to use the new alignment was the "<a href="California%20Zephyr">California Zephyr</a>", on July 16.

Debates ensued over the fate of the Marysvale Branch line. The mines at the end of the line had long closed; the last train to traverse the entire length of the line passed through in 1970. Still, farmers and industry in the <a href="Sevier%20Valley">Sevier</a> and <a href="Sanpete%20Valley">Sanpete Valley</a>s generated enough traffic that the line broke even most years. However, this line was severely damaged, with several washed-out bridges and railroad tracks draping over the sides of newly created cliffs. The railroad determined that at best it would take years to recover the cost of rebuilding the line.
The residents of <a href="Richfield%2C%20Utah">Richfield</a> pressured the Rio Grande to use the portion of the line that was still intact and build a connection to an existing Union Pacific line (the <a href="Sharp%20Subdivision">Sharp Subdivision</a>) near <a href="Nephi%2C%20Utah">Nephi</a>, roughly parallel to <a href="Utah%20State%20Route%2028">State Route 28</a>. However, the railroad determined with the additional cost of acquiring land for the new right-of-way, the cost would be comparable to rebuilding the old route. In addition, the Rio Grande would have to pay <a href="trackage%20rights">trackage rights</a> to the Union Pacific for the connection from Nephi, which would further erode profits on a line that was barely profitable. In the end, the Rio Grande sold the line to a scrap dealer who dismantled it. Since the line's closure, there have been multiple proposals to rebuild it. Studies note the loss of railroad access to the region has affected the ability of local industries to compete with producers in other regions that have rail access. A 2002 study placed the cost of rebuilding the modified routing of the Marysvale Branch line at $80 million, while a 2015 study placed the cost of rebuilding the line as far south as <a href="Salina%2C%20Utah">Salina</a> at $110 million (equivalent to $ million in 2019). The 2015 study listed restoring rail access to the region as one of three priorities for new freight rail lines in a study presented by the <a href="Utah%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Utah Department of Transportation</a> detailing the current state of Utah's rail infrastructure. It specifically noted an increase of coal hauling trucks on highways and streets in the area due to the loss of rail access.

The new alignment of US‑6/US‑89 was opened on December 30, 1983. The dedication was planned for the next day, but lines of cars formed at the barricades as soon as news broke that the highway was complete. Some were residents anxious to see the area or visit relatives they had not seen since the slide; others were truck drivers frustrated by long detours. The Highway Patrol requested the ceremony be canceled and the highway opened early, as they were unable to disperse the crowds.

When the first traffic flowed, crews had not finished some final tasks, such as <a href="Road%20surface%20marking">striping</a> the roadway. Motorists saw a relocation with several mountain cuts built high up the canyon wall, with a view of the slide and former lake. The roadbed was not expected to last, as weather conditions had been unfavorable when the asphalt was laid. Two mountain cuts were unstable, requiring several months of work before they could be left unattended. During this time, the state stationed two full-time watches at the cuts, who would close the road while falling rocks were cleared. The cut through Billies Mountain was described by the construction crews as a new, man-made <a href="mountain%20pass">mountain pass</a>.

The pending completion of the again-rebuilt US‑6/US‑89, with properly laid asphalt and stable rock cuts, was announced in November 1984, 18 months after the closure of the original alignment. Starting in 1993, the Utah Department of Transportation began discussions with former Thistle residents to build a memorial to the town. The department maintains a view area overlooking the townsite along US‑6/US‑89.

On August 4, 2018, a lightning bolt sparked a large fire in Spanish Fork Canyon. More than of land were destroyed by the fire. Residents of the canyon were evacuated as a precaution. The fire affected Thistle, leading to the destruction of many of the remaining structures.

The landslide area near Thistle is a valley formed in a depression in an area of <a href="bedrock">bedrock</a> known as the Charleston–Nebo <a href="Thrust%20fault">thrust</a> plate. The rock in this plate dates from the <a href="Permian">Permian</a> and <a href="Pennsylvanian%20%28geology%29">Pennsylvanian</a> to the <a href="Jurassic">Jurassic</a> periods, but the plate appears to have formed elsewhere and moved to the modern Thistle area during the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> epoch. The layers of <a href="sedimentary%20rock">sedimentary rock</a> above the thrust plate are younger, dating to the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> and <a href="Tertiary">Tertiary</a> periods. The <a href="Debris">rock debris</a> in the landslide itself comes from the <a href="North%20Horn%20Formation">North Horn</a> and <a href="Ankareh%20Formation">Ankareh</a> <a href="Formation%20%28stratigraphy%29">formations</a>.

The area around Thistle has always been prone to landslides. Pre-historic landslides created the more gentle slopes that made the area usable as a transportation corridor across the Wasatch Mountains. Minor landslides have been frequently observed, and continue to occur. The largest recorded landslides are the 1983 slide which destroyed the town, and a smaller one in 1998.

The climate at downstream Spanish Fork is classified as arid with four distinct seasons. Temperatures range from an average high of in July and an average low of in January. Except for the spring months, precipitation averages less than per month.

Operation Tractable

Operation Tractable was the final attack conducted by <a href="Canada%20in%20World%20War%20II">Canadian</a> and <a href="Polish%20contribution%20to%20World%20War%20II">Polish</a> troops, supported by a British tank brigade, during the <a href="Operation%20Overlord">Battle of Normandy</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The operation was to capture the tactically important <a href="France">French</a> town of <a href="Falaise%2C%20Calvados">Falaise</a> and then the smaller towns of <a href="Trun%2C%20Orne">Trun</a> and <a href="Chambois%2C%20Orne">Chambois</a>. This operation was undertaken by the <a href="First%20Canadian%20Army">First Canadian Army</a> with the <a href="1st%20Armoured%20Division%20%28Poland%29">1st Polish Armoured Division</a> ("<a href="Genera%C5%82%20brygady">Generał brygady</a>" <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Maczek">Stanisław Maczek</a>) and a British armoured brigade against <a href="Army%20Group%20B">Army Group B</a> of the "<a href="Westheer">Westheer</a>" in what became the largest encirclement on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Western Front</a> during the Second World War. Despite a slow start and limited gains north of Falaise, novel tactics by the 1st Polish Armoured Division during the drive for <a href="Chambois%2C%20Orne">Chambois</a> enabled the <a href="Falaise%20Pocket">Falaise Gap</a> to be partially closed by 19 August 1944, trapping about 150,000 German soldiers in the Falaise Pocket.

Although the Falaise Gap was narrowed to a distance of several hundred metres/yards, attacks and counter-attacks by two battle groups of the 1st Polish Armoured Division and the <a href="II%20SS%20Panzer%20Corps">II SS Panzer Corps</a> on <a href="Hill%20262">Hill 262</a> (Mont Ormel) prevented the quick closing of the gap and thousands of German troops escaped on foot. During two days of nearly continuous fighting, the Polish forces assisted by <a href="artillery">artillery</a>-fire, managed to hold off counter-attacks by seven German divisions in hand-to-hand fighting. On 21 August, elements of the First Canadian Army relieved the Polish survivors and sealed the Falaise Pocket by linking up with the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Central">Third US Army</a>. This led to the surrender and capture of the remaining units of the German <a href="7th%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">7th Army</a> in the pocket.
Following break-out by the US <a href="U.S.%20First%20Army">1st</a> and <a href="U.S.%203rd%20Army">3rd Armies</a> from the beachhead during the <a href="Operation%20Overlord">Battle of Normandy</a> after <a href="Operation%20Cobra">Operation Cobra</a> on 25 July 1944, <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> ordered an immediate counterattack against Allied forces in the form of <a href="Operation%20L%C3%BCttich">Operation Lüttich</a>. <a href="Lieutenant%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Omar%20Bradley">Omar Bradley</a>—the commanding general of the US <a href="12th%20Army%20Group">12th Army Group</a>—was notified of the counterattack in advance through signals intercepted via <a href="Ultra">Ultra</a> radio intercepts and deciphering and thus prepared his troops and their commanders to defeat this counteroffensive and to encircle as much of the "Wehrmacht" force as possible. By the afternoon of 7 August, Operation Lüttich had been defeated by concerted, large-scale <a href="fighter-bomber">fighter-bomber</a> air strikes against the German tanks and trucks. In the process, forces of the <a href="7th%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">German 7th Army</a> became further enveloped by the Allied advance out of Normandy.

Following these failed German offensives, the town of Falaise became a major objective of Commonwealth forces, since its capture would cut off virtually all of "<a href="Generalfeldmarschall">Generalfeldmarschall</a>" <a href="G%C3%BCnther%20von%20Kluge">Günther von Kluge</a>'s Army Group B. To achieve this, General <a href="Harry%20Crerar">Harry Crerar</a>, commanding the newly formed Canadian 1st Army and <a href="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</a> <a href="Guy%20Simonds">Guy Simonds</a>—commanding the <a href="II%20Canadian%20Corps">Canadian II Corps</a>, planned an Anglo-Canadian offensive with the code name of <a href="Operation%20Totalize">Operation Totalize</a>. This offensive was designed to break through the defences in the Anglo-Canadian sector of the Normandy front. Operation Totalize would rely on an unusual night attack using heavy <a href="bomber">bomber</a>s and the new <a href="Kangaroo%20%28armoured%20personnel%20carrier%29">Kangaroo armoured personnel carriers</a> to achieve a breakthrough of German defences. Despite initial gains on <a href="Battle%20of%20Verri%C3%A8res%20Ridge">Verrières Ridge</a> and near Cintheaux, the <a href="Canadian%20Army">Canadian Army</a>'s offensive stalled on 9 August, with strong "Wehrmacht" counterattacks resulting in heavy casualties for the Canadian and Polish armoured and infantry divisions. By 10 August, Canadian troops had reached Hill 195, north of Falaise. They were unable to advance farther immediately and they had been unable to capture Falaise.

Operation Tractable incorporated lessons learned from Operation Totalize, notably the effectiveness of mechanized infantry units and tactical bombing raids by heavy bombers. Unlike the previous operation, Tractable was launched in daylight. An initial bombing raid was to weaken German defences and was to be followed by an advance by the <a href="4th%20Canadian%20%28Armoured%29%20Division">Canadian 4th Armoured Division</a> on the western flank of Hill 195, while the <a href="3rd%20Canadian%20Infantry%20Division">Canadian 3rd Infantry Division</a> attacked on the eastern flank with the <a href="2nd%20Canadian%20Armoured%20Brigade">Canadian 2nd Armoured Brigade</a> in support. Their advance would be protected by a large smokescreen laid down by Canadian artillery. <a href="Field%20Marshal">Field Marshal</a> <a href="Bernard%20Montgomery">Bernard Montgomery</a> hoped that Canadian forces would achieve control of Falaise by midnight on August 14. From there, all three formations would advance towards <a href="Trun%2C%20Orne">Trun</a>, east of Falaise, with the additional assistance of the <a href="1st%20Armoured%20Division%20%28Poland%29">Polish 1st Armoured Division</a>, numbering approximately 10,000 men. Once in Trun, a linkup with the <a href="U.S.%20Third%20Army">American 3rd Army</a> at Chambois could be quickly accomplished.

The main opposition to Simonds's force was the <a href="12th%20SS%20Panzer%20Division%20Hitlerjugend">12th SS Panzer Division</a>, which included the remnants of two infantry divisions. German forces within the Falaise Pocket approached 350,000 men. Had surprise been achieved, the Canadians would likely have succeeded in a rapid break-through. However, on the night of 13/14 August, a Canadian officer lost his way while moving between divisional headquarters. He drove into German lines and was promptly killed. The Germans discovered a copy of Simonds' orders on his body. As a result, the 12th SS Panzer Division placed the bulk of its remaining strength—500 grenadiers and 15 tanks, along with twelve <a href="8.8%20cm%20PaK%2043">8.8 cm PaK 43 anti-tank guns</a>— along the Allies' expected line of approach.

Operation Tractable began at 12:00 on 14 August, when 800 <a href="Avro%20Lancaster">Avro Lancaster</a> and <a href="Handley%20Page%20Halifax">Handley Page Halifax</a> <a href="heavy%20bomber">heavy bomber</a>s of <a href="RAF%20Bomber%20Command">RAF Bomber Command</a> struck German positions along the front. As with Totalize, many of the bombers mistakenly dropped their bombs short of their targets, causing 400 Polish and Canadian casualties. Covered by a <a href="smoke%20screen">smoke screen</a> laid down by their artillery, two Canadian divisions moved forwards. Although their line of sight was reduced, German units still managed to inflict severe casualties on the Canadian 4th Armoured Division, which included its Armoured Brigade commander Brigadier Leslie Booth, as the division moved south toward Falaise. Throughout the day, continual attacks by the Canadian 4th and Polish 1st Armoured Divisions managed to force a crossing of the Laison River. Limited access to the crossing points over the Dives River allowed counterattacks by the German <a href="102nd%20SS%20heavy%20tank%20battalion">102nd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion</a>. The town of <a href="Potigny">Potigny</a> fell to Polish forces in the late afternoon. By the end of the first day, elements of the Canadian 3rd and 4th Divisions had reached Point 159, directly north of Falaise, although they had been unable to break into the town. To bolster his offensive, Simonds ordered the <a href="2nd%20Canadian%20Infantry%20Division">Canadian 2nd Infantry Division</a> to move toward the front, with the hope that this reinforcement would be sufficient to enable his divisions to capture the town.

Although the first day's progress was slower than expected, Operation Tractable resumed on 15 August; both armoured divisions pushed southeast toward Falaise. The Canadian 2nd and 3rd Infantry Divisions—with the support of the <a href="2nd%20Canadian%20%28Armoured%29%20Brigade">Canadian 2nd Armoured Brigade</a>—continued their drive south towards the town. After harsh fighting, the 4th Armoured Division captured Soulangy but the gains made were minimal as strong German resistance prevented a breakthrough to Trun. On 16 August, the Canadian 2nd Infantry Division broke into Falaise, encountering minor opposition from "<a href="Waffen-SS">Waffen-SS</a>" units and scattered pockets of German infantry. Although it would take two more days to clear all resistance in the town, the first major objective of Operation Tractable had been achieved. Simonds began to reorganize the bulk of his armoured forces for a renewed push towards Trun to close the Falaise Pocket.

The drive for Trun by Polish and Canadian Armoured Divisions began on 16 August, with preliminary attacks in preparation for an assault against Trun and Chambois. On 17 August, both armoured divisions of the Canadian 1st Army advanced. By early afternoon, the Polish 1st Armoured Division had outflanked the 12th SS Panzer Division, enabling several Polish formations to both reach the 4th Armoured Division's objectives and significantly expand the bridgehead northwest of Trun. <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Maczek">Stanisław Maczek</a>—the Polish divisional commander—split his forces into three battlegroups each of an armoured regiment and an infantry battalion. One of these struck southwest, cutting off Trun and establishing itself on the high ground dominating the town and the Dives river valley, allowing for a powerful assault by the Canadian 4th Armoured Division on Trun. The town was liberated on the morning of 18 August.

As Canadian and Polish forces liberated Trun, Maczek's second armoured battlegroup manoeuvred southeast, capturing <a href="Champeaux-sur-Sarthe">Champeaux</a> and anchoring future attacks against Chambois across a front. At its closest, the front was from forces of the <a href="V%20Corps%20%28United%20States%29">US V Corps</a> in the town. By the evening of 18 August, all of Maczek's battlegroups had established themselves directly north of Chambois (one outside of the town, one near Vimoutiers and one at the foot of <a href="Hill%20262">Hill 262</a>). With reinforcements quickly arriving from the 4th Canadian 4th Armoured Division, Maczek was in an ideal position to close the gap the following day. The presence of the Polish Armoured Division also alerted <a href="Field%20Marshal%20%28Germany%29">"Generalfeldmarshall"</a> <a href="Walther%20Model">Walther Model</a> of the need to keep the pocket open.

Early on 19 August, LGen Simonds met with his divisional commanders to finalize plans for closing the gap. The 4th Armoured Division would attack toward Chambois, on the western flank of two battlegroups of the Polish 1st Armoured Division. Two additional Polish battlegroups would strike eastward, securing Hill 262 to cover the eastern flanks of the assault. The 2nd and 3rd Infantry Divisions would continue their grinding offensives against the northern extremities of the Falaise Pocket, inflicting heavy casualties on the exhausted remains of the 12th SS Panzer Division. The assault began almost immediately after the meeting, with one battlegroup of the Polish 1st advancing toward Chambois and "Currie Task Force" of the 4th Armoured Division covering their advance. Simultaneously, two Polish battlegroups moved for Hill 262. Despite heavy German resistance, Battlegroup Zgorzelski was able to secure Point 137, directly west of Hill 262. By early afternoon, Battlegroup Stefanowicz had captured the hill, annihilating a German infantry company in the process. As a result of the fighting, Polish casualties accounted for nearly 50% of those sustained by the Canadian 1st Army.

By late afternoon of 19 August, Canadian and Polish forces had linked with the US <a href="80th%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">80th Division</a> and <a href="90th%20Sustainment%20Brigade%20%28United%20States%29">90th Division</a> already stationed in the town. The Falaise Gap had been closed, trapping Model′s forces. As the linkup occurred, Model′s II SS Panzer Corps had begun its counterattack against Polish forces on Hill 262, hoping to reopen the pocket. With American and Canadian forces facing German counterattacks in their sectors, the Polish forces would have to defend against two veteran "Panzer" divisions to keep the gap closed.

On the morning of 20 August, two German formations—the <a href="2nd%20SS%20Division%20Das%20Reich">2nd</a> and <a href="9th%20SS%20Panzer%20Division%20Hohenstaufen">9th SS Panzer Divisions</a>, attacked Polish positions on Hill 262. At the same time, the <a href="16th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">16th Infantry</a> and 12th SS Panzer Divisions attacked American and Canadian forces from within the pocket, opening small channels through Allied positions. By mid-morning, 2,000 survivors of the German <a href="2nd%20Parachute%20Division%20%28Germany%29">2nd Parachute Division</a> had managed to breach Canadian positions along the Dives River, as well as at Point 117. At approximately noon, several units of the <a href="10th%20SS%20Panzer%20Division%20Frundsberg">10th SS</a>, 12th SS and 116th Panzer Divisions managed to break through these weakened positions.

By mid afternoon, reinforcements from an armoured battlegroup under Major <a href="David%20Vivian%20Currie">David Vivian Currie</a> managed to reach <a href="St.%20Lambert-sur-Dives">St. Lambert-sur-Dives</a>, denying two German armies evacuation of the pocket. Over the next 36 hours, the battlegroup repulsed almost continual attacks by German forces, destroying seven German tanks, twelve anti-tank guns and 40 vehicles. In the brutal fighting around Lambert-sur-Dives, Currie's battlegroup was able to inflict nearly 2,000 casualties on attacking German forces, including 300 killed and 1,100 captured. By the evening of 20 August, the Germans had exhausted their attack against St. Lambert-sur-Dives; the surviving members of the 84th Corps—commanded by General Elfeld—surrendered to Canadian and American forces near Chambois. For his actions at St. Lambert-sur-Dives, Currie was awarded the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>, the only Canadian so honoured for service in the Normandy Campaign.

While Currie's force stalled German forces outside of St. Lambert, two battlegroups of Maczek's Polish 1st Armoured Division were engaged in a protracted battle with two well-trained SS Panzer divisions. Throughout the night of the 19th, Polish forces had entrenched themselves along the south, southwest and northeastern lines of approach to Hill 262. Directly southwest of Mont Ormel, German units moved along what would later become known as "The Corridor of Death", as the Polish inflicted heavy casualties on German forces moving towards Mont Ormel with a well-coordinated artillery barrage. The Polish infantry and armour were supported by the guns of the 58th Battery, 4th Medium Regiment, 2nd Canadian Army Group Royal Artillery (AGRA) and assisted by the <a href="Artillery%20observer">Artillery observer</a>, <a href="Pierre%20S%C3%A9vigny">Pierre Sévigny</a>. <a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20100130225325/http%3A//www.artillery.net/new/6rac.html"></a> Captain Pierre Sévigny's assistance was crucial in defending Hill 262 and he later received the <a href="Virtuti%20Militari">Virtuti Militari</a> (Poland's highest military decoration) for his exertions during the battle. <a href="http%3A//www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/46/a2450846.shtml"></a>

From the northeast, the 2nd SS Panzer Division planned an assault in force against the four infantry battalions and two armoured regiments of the Polish 1st Armoured Division dug in on Hill 262. The 9th SS Panzer Division would attack from the north, while simultaneously preventing Canadian units from reinforcing the Polish armoured division. Having managed to break out of the Falaise Pocket, the 10th SS, 12th SS and 116th Panzer Divisions would then attack Hill 262 from the southwest. If this major obstacle could be cleared, German units could initiate a full withdrawal from the Falaise Pocket.

The first attack against Polish positions was by the ""Der Führer"" Regiment of the 2nd SS Panzer Division. Although the <a href="Podhale%20Rifles">Podhale Rifles</a> battalion was able to repel the attack, it expended a substantial amount of its ammunition in doing so. The second attack was devastating to the dwindling armoured forces of the Polish battlegroups. A single German tank, positioned on Point 239 (northeast of Mont Ormel), was able to destroy five <a href="M4%20Sherman">Sherman</a> medium tanks within two minutes. At this time, the 3rd Parachute Division—along with an armoured regiment of the 1st SS Panzer Division—attacked Mont Ormel from inside the Falaise Pocket. This attack was repulsed by the artillery, which "massacred" German infantry and armour closing in on their positions.

As the assault from the southwest ran out of steam, the 2nd SS Panzer Division resumed its attack on the northeast of the ridge. Since Polish units were now concentrated on the southern edges of the position, the 2nd SS was able to force a path through to the 3rd Parachute Division by noon, opening a corridor out of the pocket. By mid-afternoon, close to 10,000 German troops had escaped through the corridor. Despite being overwhelmed by strong counterattacks, Polish forces continued to hold the high ground on Mont Ormel, which they referred to as "The Mace" ("Maczuga"), exacting a deadly toll on passing German forces through the use of well-coordinated artillery fire. Irritated by the presence of these units, which were exacting a heavy toll on his men, "Generaloberst" <a href="Paul%20Hausser">Paul Hausser</a>—commanding the 7th Army—ordered the positions to be "eliminated". Although substantial forces, including the <a href="352nd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">352nd Infantry Division</a> and several battlegroups from the 2nd SS Panzer Division inflicted heavy casualties on the 8th and 9th Battalions of the Polish 1st Armoured Division, the counterattack was ultimately fought off. The battle had cost the Poles almost all of their ammunition, leaving them in a precarious position.

At 19:00 on 20 August, a 20-minute ceasefire was arranged to allow German forces to evacuate a large convoy of medical vehicles. Immediately following the passage of these vehicles, the fighting resumed and intensified. Although the Germans were incapable of dislodging the Polish forces, the hill's defenders had reached the point of exhaustion. With ammunition supplies extremely low, the Poles were forced to watch as the remnants of the <a href="XLVII%20Panzer%20Corps%20%28Germany%29">XLVII Panzer Corps</a> escaped from the pocket. Despite this, Polish artillery continued to bombard every German unit that entered the evacuation corridor. Stefanowicz—commander of the Polish battlegroups on Hill 262—was sceptical of his force's chance of survival:

Gentlemen. Everything is lost. I do not believe [the] Canadians will manage to help us. We have only 110 men left, with 50 rounds per gun and 5 rounds per tank ... Fight to the end! To surrender to the SS is senseless, you know it well. Gentlemen! Good luck – tonight, we will die for Poland and civilization. We will fight to the last platoon, to the last tank, then to the last man.

Night was welcomed by the German and Polish forces surrounding Mont Ormel. Fighting was sporadic, as both sides avoided contact with one another. Frequent Polish artillery barrages interrupted German attempts to retreat from the sector. In the morning, German attacks on the position resumed. Although not as coordinated as on the day before, the attack still managed to reach the last of the Polish defenders on Mont Ormel. As the remaining Polish forces repelled the assault, their tanks were forced to use the last of their ammunition. At approximately 12:00, the last SS remnants launched a final assault on the positions of the 9th Battalion. Polish forces defeated them at point-blank range. There would be no further attacks; the two battlegroups of the Polish 1st Armoured Division had survived the onslaught, despite being surrounded by German forces for three days. Both Reynolds and McGilvray place the Polish losses on the "Maczuga" at 351 killed and wounded and 11 tanks lost, although Jarymowycz gives higher figures of 325 killed, 1,002 wounded, and 114 missing — approximately 20% of the division's combat strength. Within an hour, <a href="The%20Canadian%20Grenadier%20Guards">The Canadian Grenadier Guards</a> managed to link up with what remained of Stefanowicz's men. By late afternoon, the remainder of the 2nd and 9th SS Panzer Divisions had begun their retreat to the <a href="Seine">Seine</a> River. The Falaise Gap had been permanently closed, with a large number of German forces still trapped in the pocket.

By the evening of 21 August 1944, the vast majority of the German forces remaining in the Falaise Pocket had surrendered. Nearly all of the strong German formations that had caused significant damage to the Canadian 1st Army throughout the Normandy campaign had been destroyed. Two panzer divisions—the "Panzer Lehr" and 9th SS—now existed in name only. The formidable 12th SS Panzer Division had lost 94% of its armour, nearly all of its field-guns and 70% of its vehicles. Several German units, notably the 2nd and the 12th SS Panzer Divisions had managed to escape east toward the Seine River, albeit without most of their motorized equipment. Conservative estimates for the number of German soldiers captured in the Falaise Pocket approach 50,000, although some estimates put total German losses (killed and captured) in the Pocket as high as 200,000.

By 23 August, the remainder of the Wehrmacht's Seventh Army had entrenched itself along the Seine River, in preparation for the defence of <a href="Paris">Paris</a>. Simultaneously, elements of <a href="Army%20Group%20G">Army Group G</a>—including the <a href="15th%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">German 15th Army</a> and the <a href="5th%20Panzer%20Army">5th Panzer Army</a>—moved to engage American forces in the south. In the following week, elements of the Canadian 1st Army repeatedly attacked these German units on the Seine in attempts to break through to the Channel Ports. On the evening of 23 August, French and American Army units entered Paris.

Due to the successive offensives of early August, exact Canadian casualties for Operation Tractable are not known but losses during Totalize and Tractable are put at 5,500 men. German casualties during Operation Tractable are also uncertain; approximate figures can be found for casualties within the Falaise Pocket but not for the Canadian operations during Tractable. After the Falaise Pocket, the German 7th Army was severely depleted, having lost from 50,000–200,000 men, over 200 tanks, 1,000 guns and 5,000 other vehicles. In the fighting around Hill 262, the Germans lost 2,000 men killed, 5,000 taken prisoner, 55 tanks, 44 guns and 152 armoured vehicles. Polish casualties for Operation Tractable (until 22 August) are 1,441 men, of whom 325 were killed (including 21 officers), 1,002 were wounded (35 officers) and 114 missing, which includes 263 men lost before the Chambois and Ormel actions from 14–18 August.

In the British and Commonwealth system of <a href="battle%20honours">battle honours</a>, participation in Operation Tractable (included as part of the honour Falaise for service from 7–22 August) was recognized in 1957, 1958, and 1959 by the award of the battle honours Laison (or "The Laison" for Canadian units), for service on 14–17 August, Chambois from 18–22 August and St Lambert-sur-Dives from 19–22 August.

Mukhtar al-Thaqafi

Mukhtār ibn Abī ʿUbayd al-Thaqafī (; c. 622 – 3 April 687) was a pro-<a href="Alids">Alid</a> revolutionary based in <a href="Kufa">Kufa</a>, who led a rebellion against the <a href="Umayyad%20Caliphate">Umayyad Caliphate</a> and ruled over most of <a href="History_of_Iraq%23Middle_Ages">Iraq</a> for eighteen months during the <a href="Second%20Fitna">Second Islamic Civil War</a>.

Born in <a href="Ta%27if">Ta'if</a>, Mukhtar moved to Iraq at a young age and grew up in Kufa. Following the death of <a href="Husayn%20ibn%20Ali">Husayn ibn Ali</a>, a grandson of the Islamic prophet <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>, at the hands of the Umayyad army in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Karbala">Battle of Karbala</a> in 680, he allied with the rival <a href="Caliphate">caliph</a> <a href="Abd%20Allah%20ibn%20al-Zubayr">Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr</a> in <a href="Mecca">Mecca</a>, but the alliance was short-lived. Mukhtar returned to Kufa where he declared <a href="Muhammad%20ibn%20al-Hanafiyyah">Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah</a>, a son of caliph <a href="Ali">Ali</a> (r. 656–661) and brother of Husayn, the <a href="Mahdi">Mahdi</a> and the <a href="Imamah%20%28Shia%29">Imam</a>, and called for the establishment of an Alid caliphate and retaliation for Husayn's killing. He took over Kufa in October 685, after expelling its Zubayrid governor, and later ordered the execution of those involved in the killing of Husayn. Hostile relations with Ibn al-Zubayr ultimately led to Mukhtar's death by the forces of the Zubayrid governor of <a href="Basra">Basra</a>, <a href="Mus%27ab%20ibn%20al-Zubayr">Mus'ab ibn al-Zubayr</a>, following a four-month siege.

Although Mukhtar was defeated, his movement would have far-reaching consequences. After his death, his followers formed a radical <a href="Shia%20Islam">Shia</a> sect, later known as the <a href="Kaysanites">Kaysanites</a>, who developed several novel doctrines and influenced later Shia ideology. Mukhtar raised the social status of <a href="Mawla%23History">"mawālī"</a> (local converts to Islam) and they became an important political entity. The "mawālī" and Kaysanites went on to play a significant role in the <a href="Abbasid%20Revolution">Abbasid Revolution</a> sixty years later. Mukhtar is a controversial figure among Muslims; condemned by many as a false prophet, but revered by Shia because of his support for the Alids. Modern historians' views range from regarding him as a sincere revolutionary to an ambitious opportunist.

Mukhtar was born in Ta'if in 622 CE (the year that the Islamic prophet <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> migrated to <a href="Medina">Medina</a>) to <a href="Abu%20Ubayd%20al-Thaqafi">Abu Ubayd al-Thaqafi</a>, a Muslim army commander from the <a href="Banu%20Thaqif">Banu Thaqif</a> tribe, and Dawma bint Amr ibn Wahb ibn Muattib. Following Muhammad's death in 632, <a href="Abu%20Bakr">Abu Bakr</a> became <a href="caliphate">caliph</a>. He died two years later and was succeeded by <a href="Umar">Umar</a>, who expanded the <a href="early%20Muslim%20conquests">Muslim conquests</a> initiated by Abu Bakr, and sent Mukhtar's father Abu Ubayd to the <a href="Muslim%20conquest%20of%20Persia">Iraqi front</a>. Abu Ubayd was killed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Bridge">Battle of the Bridge</a> in November 634. Mukhtar, then thirteen years old, remained in <a href="History_of_Iraq%23Middle_Ages">Iraq</a> after the Muslim conquest of this region, and was raised by his uncle Saad ibn Masud al-Thaqafi. Umar was assassinated by a Persian slave <a href="Piruz%20Nahavandi">Piruz Nahavandi</a> in 644, after which his successor, <a href="Uthman">Uthman</a>, ruled for twelve years before being <a href="Siege%20of%20Uthman">assassinated by rebels</a> in 656. 

After Uthman's death, <a href="Ali">Ali</a>, a cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad, became caliph and moved the capital from Medina to <a href="Kufa">Kufa</a>, where Mukhtar held some minor office under him, and Mukhtar's uncle became governor of nearby <a href="al-Mada%27in">al-Mada'in</a>. A few <a href="sahabah">companions</a> of Muhammad, including <a href="Muawiyah%20I">Muawiyah</a>, the governor of <a href="Syria%20%28region%29">Syria</a>, refused to recongnise Ali's authority, and <a href="First%20Fitna">war</a> broke out. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Siffin">Battle of Siffin</a> ended in stalemate (July 657), when Ali's forces refused to fight in response to Muawiyah's calls for arbitration. Ali reluctantly agreed to talks but a faction of his forces, later called <a href="Khawarij">Kharijite</a>s, broke away in protest, condemning Ali's acceptance of arbitration as blasphemous. Arbitration could not settle the dispute between Muawiyah and Ali and the latter was subsequently murdered by a Kharijite in January 661.

Ali's eldest son <a href="Hasan%20ibn%20Ali">Hasan</a> became caliph, but Muawiyah challenged his authority and invaded Iraq. While Hasan was mobilizing his troops, he was injured by a Kharijite near al-Mada'in and was brought to the home of Mukhtar's uncle. There, Mukhtar reportedly recommended that Hasan be handed over to Muawiyah in return for political favour, but was rebuffed by his uncle. In August 661, Hasan abdicated the caliphate to Muawiyah in a <a href="Hasan%E2%80%93Muawiya%20treaty">peace treaty</a> and the capital was transferred to <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a>. A few years before his death, Muawiyah nominated his son <a href="Yazid%20I">Yazid</a> as his successor, thus founding the <a href="Umayyad%20Caliphate">Umayyad Caliphate</a>. Yazid’s nomination angered <a href="Alids">Alid</a> partisans, because it was seen as the violation of the peace treaty, which stipulated that Muawiyah would not nominate a successor. Scant information exists about Mukhtar's early life and he only rose to prominence when he was aged around sixty.

Upon Yazid's accession in April 680, pro-Alid Kufans urged <a href="Husayn%20ibn%20Ali">Husayn ibn Ali</a>, the younger brother of now deceased Hasan, to lead a revolt against Yazid. Husayn subsequently sent his cousin <a href="Muslim%20ibn%20Aqil">Muslim ibn Aqil</a> to assess the political environment in Kufa. Mukhtar hosted Ibn Aqil at his house before the arrival of <a href="Ubayd%20Allah%20ibn%20Ziyad">Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad</a>. The latter was appointed to replace Mukhtar's father-in-law, Nu'man ibn Bashir, as governor due to Ibn Bashir's benign attitude towards Ibn Aqil and his followers. As a result of Ibn Ziyad's suppression and political maneuvering, Ibn Aqil's following started melting away and he was forced to declare the revolt prematurely. Mukhtar was not in the city at the time. After hearing the news, he attempted to gather supporters from Kufa's environs, but Ibn Aqil's revolt was defeated and he was executed before Mukhtar returned to the city. Mukhtar was arrested and brought to the governor but he denied involvement in the revolt. While Mukhtar was imprisoned, Husayn was slain by Ibn Ziyad's forces at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Karbala">Battle of Karbala</a> on 10 October 680. Mukhtar was afterward released upon the intervention of <a href="Abdullah%20ibn%20Umar">Abdullah ibn Umar</a>, an influential son of the second caliph and Mukhtar's brother-in-law, and ordered to leave Kufa.

By this time, <a href="Abd%20Allah%20ibn%20al-Zubayr">Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr</a>, a son of Muhammad's companion <a href="Zubayr%20ibn%20al-Awam">Zubayr ibn al-Awam</a>, secretly started taking allegiance in <a href="Mecca">Mecca</a> and came to control the entire <a href="Hejaz">Hejaz</a> (western Arabia). Having left Kufa, Mukhtar headed for Mecca and offered allegiance to Ibn al-Zubayr on the condition that he be consulted about important matters and awarded a high post, which Ibn al-Zubayr refused. Mukhtar then left for Ta'if and, after one year, Ibn al-Zubayr, persuaded by his advisers, accepted Mukhtar's homage under the same terms. When Yazid dispatched an army to <a href="Siege%20of%20Mecca%20%28683%29">retake Mecca</a> in 683, Mukhtar participated in the city's defence. After Yazid died in November, the Umayyad army retreated and Ibn al-Zubayr openly proclaimed his caliphate. Mukhtar was informed by people coming from Kufa that the city had come under Ibn al-Zubayr's control but many Kufans were looking for an independent leader of their own. He claimed that he was the man they were looking for. While in Mecca, he sought permission from Ali's son, <a href="Muhammad%20ibn%20al-Hanafiyyah">Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah</a>, to avenge Husayn’s death and secure power for Ibn al-Hanafiyyah. The latter responded that he neither approved nor disapproved of such an action, but bloodshed should be avoided. Earlier, he had made the same offer to Husayn's son <a href="Ali%20ibn%20Husayn%20Zayn%20al-Abidin">Ali Zayn al-Abidin</a> but was refused. Five months after Yazid's death, he returned to Kufa without informing Ibn al-Zubayr, who he thought had not kept his promise.

In Kufa, Mukhtar began recruiting people to take revenge against the killers of Husayn, promising them victory and fortune. At the same time, Sulayman ibn Surad, a companion of Muhammad and an Alid supporter, was rallying a group of Kufans, who called themselves <a href="Tawwabin%20uprising">Tawwabin</a>, to fight the Umayyads to atone for their failure to support Husayn during the Battle of Karbala. The Tawwabin movement created difficulties for Mukhtar. Most pro-Alid Kufans supported Ibn Surad because he was Muhammad's companion, and as a result, Mukhtar was unable to attract many recruits. He criticised the Tawwabin's actions as premature and destined for failure, arguing that Ibn Surad was old, weak, and militarily inexperienced. He then claimed that he was a lieutenant of Ibn al-Hanafiyyah, whom he called the <a href="Mahdi">Mahdi</a> (Messiah). He convinced many Alid partisans, including some five hundred <a href="Mawla%23History">"mawālī"</a> (sing. "mawlā"; local converts to Islam), that he was working under the orders of the Mahdi. 

Doubting the authenticity of Mukhtar's claims, a group of Alid partisans from Kufa went to Mecca seeking verification from Ibn al-Hanafiyyah. He replied in an ambiguous manner that he was satisfied with anyone whom God uses to take revenge on enemies of the family of the prophet. They interpreted this as confirmation of Mukhtar's claims and returned to join him. To win over the hitherto unpersuaded <a href="Ibrahim%20ibn%20al-Ashtar">Ibrahim ibn al-Ashtar</a>, an influential Alid partisan and head of the <a href="Nukha%20%28tribe%29">Nakhai</a> tribe, Mukhtar presented him with a letter, which he claimed was authored by Ibn al-Hanafiyyah. In it, Ibn al-Hanafiyyah ostensibly called himself the Mahdi and urged Ibn al-Ashtar to support Mukhtar. After expressing some doubts, Ibn al-Ashtar eventually joined him. The letter was likely fabricated, and Ibn al-Hanafiyyah seems to have had no involvement in the revolt. He tolerated the use of his name, however, and did not disapprove of Mukhtar's activities. Nonetheless, when he wanted to visit his followers in Kufa, he was deterred by a rumour, floated by Mukhtar upon hearing this news, that the true Mahdi would not die if struck by a sword.

Ibn al-Zubayr appointed Abd Allah ibn Yazid as governor of Kufa in 684. Fearful of Mukhtar, Ibn Yazid imprisoned him. Some time later, Abdullah ibn Umar interceded for Mukhtar, who promised to refrain from anti-government activity and was released.

After his release Mukhtar resumed his revolutionary activities. The Tawwabin were defeated by the Umayyads at the <a href="Battle%20of%20%27Ayn%20al-Warda">Battle of Ayn al-Warda</a> in January 685, and most of the pro-Alid Kufans shifted allegiance to Mukhtar. Ibn al-Zubayr replaced Ibn Yazid with Abd Allah ibn Muti as governor to contain the expected agitation but to no avail. Mukhtar and his followers planned to overthrow the governor and seize control of Kufa on Thursday, 19 October 685. On the evening of 17 October Mukhtar's men clashed with government forces. Mukhtar signaled an early declaration of revolt to his troops by lighting fires. By the evening of Wednesday, 18 October, the government's forces were defeated. Ibn Muti went into hiding and later, with help from Mukhtar, escaped to <a href="Basra">Basra</a>. The next morning, Mukhtar received allegiance from Kufans in the mosque on the basis of, "Book of God, <a href="Sunnah">Sunnah</a> of the Prophet, revenge for the Prophet's family, defence of the weak and war on sinners".

Support for Mukhtar's revolt came from two divergent groups: the Arab tribal nobility and the "mawālī". At first, he attempted to reconcile their differences and appease both. Most government positions, including the governorships of <a href="Mosul">Mosul</a> and al-Mada'in, were awarded to Arabs. "Mawālī", hitherto treated as lower-grade citizens, were entitled to war booty and army salaries and allowed to ride horses. He announced that any "mawālī" slaves who joined him would be freed, resulting in increased support from this group. His personal guard was also staffed by "mawālī" led by <a href="Abu%20Amra%20Kaysan">Abu Amra Kaysan</a>. Nobles, however, were disturbed by his policies towards the "mawālī". Efforts by his supporters to take Basra, which was under Zubayrid control, did not succeed. By then <a href="Abd%20al-Malik%20ibn%20Marwan">Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan</a> had taken reigns of the Umayyad power in Syria and was struggling to regain control of the lost provinces.

One year after the Battle of Ayn al-Warda, the Umayyad army occupied Mosul and headed for Kufa. Mukhtar sent three thousand cavalrymen under the command of Yazid ibn Anas. On 17 July 686, they defeated the Umayyad army, twice their size, near Mosul. That evening, after ordering the execution of all the Syrian captives, Ibn Anas died from an illness. Having lost their commander, the Kufans retreated in the face of another Umayyad army. In Kufa, rumour spread that Mukhtar's forces had been defeated and Ibn Anas slain. In response, Mukhtar deployed seven thousand reinforcements headed by Ibn al-Ashtar. Taking advantage of the troops' absence, the Kufan nobility, whose relations with Mukhtar had grown estranged due to his favouritism toward the "mawālī", attempted to topple Mukhtar by besieging his palace. They accused him of robbing their prestige: Despite the siege, Mukhtar was able to recall Ibn al-Ashtar. Three days after its departure from Kufa, Ibn al-Ashtar's army returned and defeated the revolt.

After eliminating his opposition, Mukhtar enacted punitive measures against those involved in the battle of Karbala. He executed most of them, including <a href="Umar%20ibn%20Sa%27ad">Umar ibn Sa'ad</a> and <a href="Shemr">Shimr ibn Ziljawshan</a>. Many others were killed under the pretext of their direct or indirect involvement in the battle, while about ten thousand Kufans fled to Basra. The houses of many absconders were destroyed. This further reduced Arab support for Mukhtar and he became increasingly reliant on "mawālī".

Two days after reasserting control over Kufa, Mukhtar dispatched Ibn al-Ashtar with a thirteen thousand-strong force to confront the approaching Umayyad army led by Ibn Ziyad. Some of Mukhtar's soldiers carried a chair, circling around it, which they claimed belonged to Ali and would give them victory in the battle. The idea is said to have been Mukhtar's. He had invented it to increase his support among more religious people and compared it to the <a href="Ark%20of%20the%20Covenant">Ark of the Covenant</a>, but orientalist <a href="Julius%20Wellhausen">Julius Wellhausen</a> holds he was not the originator of the concept. He allowed them to carry the chair, as he needed their zeal. The armies met at the banks of <a href="Khazir%20River">Khazir River</a> in early August. The Umayyad army was defeated, and many of the senior Umayyad military leaders including Ibn Ziyad and <a href="Husayn%20ibn%20Numayr%20al-Sakuni">Husayn ibn Numayr al-Sakuni</a> were killed. The exact date of the battle is unknown, although some sources put it on 6 August, coinciding with 10 Muharram, the date of Husayn's death. The death of Ibn Ziyad was seen as the fulfillment of Mukhtar's promise of revenge against Husayn's killers.

Sometime after expelling Ibn Muti, Mukhtar complained to Ibn al-Zubayr about the failure to keep his promise, despite Mukhtar having served him well. Mukhtar, nonetheless, offered his support if needed. Though Ibn al-Zubayr had considered Mukhtar loyal, the latter refused to surrender his control of Kufa to the caliph's appointed governor, Umar ibn Abd al-Rahman. The governor left the city after being bribed and threatened by Mukhtar.

In 686, Mukhtar feigned an offer of military support to Ibn al-Zubayr against an impending Umayyad attack on Medina with the ultimate intention of ousting him. Ibn al-Zubayr accepted and requested troops to <a href="Wadi%20al-Qura">Wadi al-Qura</a>, a valley north of Medina, but instead, Mukhtar dispatched three thousand fighters under Shurahbil ibn Wars with orders to enter Medina until further notice. Meanwhile, Ibn al-Zubayr sent his confidant Abbas ibn Sahl at the head of a two thousand-strong force with instructions to escort Ibn Wars and his men to Wadi al-Qura in anticipation of the Syrian army and to kill Mukhtar's loyalists if they refused. Ibn Wars indeed refused and was killed along with most of his men. Mukhtar subsequently informed Ibn al-Hanafiyyah of his foiled plan to seize the region for the Alid and offered to send another army to Medina if Ibn al-Hanafiyyah notified the city's inhabitants that Mukhtar was working on his behalf. Ibn al-Hanafiyyah refused, citing his opposition to bloodshed. Nonetheless, Ibn al-Zubayr, after becoming aware of Mukhtar's intentions and fearing a pro-Alid revolt in the Hejaz, detained Ibn al-Hanafiyyah to forcibly gain his allegiance, hoping Mukhtar would follow suit. Ibn al-Hanafiyyah requested help from Mukhtar, who subsequently dispatched a four thousand-strong force to free him. This caused a further deterioration in relations between Mecca and Kufa.

In 687, <a href="Mus%27ab%20ibn%20al-Zubayr">Mus'ab ibn al-Zubayr</a>, the governor of Basra and younger brother of Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, launched an assault against Kufa. A sizable portion of his army consisted of Kufan nobles, who had previously fled Mukhtar's punitive measures. The size of Mukhtar's Kufan army is not certain with ranges between three thousand to sixty thousand, depending on the source. The Kufans retreated following their defeat at the battles of Madhar, located along the <a href="Tigris">Tigris</a> between Basra and Kufa, and Harura, a village near Kufa. Mus'ab then besieged Mukhtar's palace for four months. Ibn al-Ashtar, who was then governor of Mosul, did not attempt to relieve Mukhtar, either because he was not called to action, or because he refused Mukhtar's summons. In either case, he later joined Mus'ab. On 3 April 687, Mukhtar came out of the palace accompanied by nineteen supporters, (the remainder had refused to fight), and was killed fighting. Soon afterwards, Mukhtar's remaining partisans, totaling about six thousand, surrendered and were executed by Mus'ab. One of Mukhtar's wives, Umrah bint Nu'man ibn Bashir al-Ansari, refused to denounce her husband's views and was consequently executed, while his other wife condemned him and was spared. Mukhtar's hand was cut off and hung on the wall of the mosque. His grave is, reportedly, located inside the shrine of Muslim ibn Aqil, at the back of the <a href="Great%20Mosque%20of%20Kufa">Great Mosque of Kufa</a>. Some sources, however, state that Mus'ab had burned his body.

Though Mukhtar ruled for a few years and his control was limited to Kufa and its surroundings, his ideology survived his death. It was during his rule that the "mawālī" rose to significance, much to the dissatisfaction of the Kufan Arab nobility. He had proclaimed Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah as the Mahdi and the Imam. This was likely the first reference to the Mahdi in the history of Islam. This idea became influential afterwards, particularly in <a href="Shia%20Islam">Shia Islam</a>, where it became one of its central tenets. He was the first person to introduce the concept of <a href="Bada%27">Bada'</a> (change in the divine will), when after defeat at the battle of Madhar, for which he had claimed he was promised victory, he said that God had changed his plan.

His followers later developed into a distinct Shia sect known as the <a href="Kaysanites">Kaysanites</a>. They introduced the doctrines of <a href="Occultation%20%28Islam%29">Occultation</a> (Ghayba) and <a href="Raj%60a">Return</a> (Raj'a) of the Mahdi. After the death of Ibn al-Hanafiyyah, some Kaysanites believed that he had not died but was hidden in <a href="Radwa%20Mount">Mount Radwa</a> and would return some day to rid the world of injustice. Most Kaysanites, however, declared his son <a href="Abd%20Allah%20ibn%20Muhammad%20ibn%20al-Hanafiyyah">Abu Hashim</a> to be their Imam. He then transferred the Imamate to <a href="Muhammad%20ibn%20Ali%20ibn%20Abdallah">Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Abdallah ibn Abbas</a> before dying. The <a href="Abbasid%20Caliphate">Abbasids</a> used this as a propaganda tool during their <a href="Abbasid%20Revolution">revolution</a> to boost their legitimacy and appeal to pro-Alid masses. Two of Muhammad ibn Ali's sons, <a href="as-Saffah">as-Saffah</a> and <a href="al-Mansur">al-Mansur</a>, would eventually establish the Abbasid Caliphate. Describing similarities between Mukhtar and Abbasid revolutionary <a href="Abu%20Muslim">Abu Muslim Khorasani</a>, Wellhausen writes: "If the doctrine of Raj'a is correct, then the Arab of Khutarnia [Mukhtar] came to life again in the Maula ["mawlā"] of Khutarnia [Abu Muslim]."

Many Muslims hold Mukhtar a liar who claimed prophethood and consider him an enemy of the Alids, who used their name to gain power, and executed Husayn's killers to consolidate his support among pro-Alids. Although he did not explicitly call himself a prophet, the allegations took root because of his boasting and excessive claims, which he made in the <a href="rhymed%20prose">rhymed prose</a> style of ancient Arabian <a href="Saj%27">soothsayers</a>. Muhammad is reported to have said: "In Thaqif there will be a great liar and destroyer." To them, the liar is Mukhtar and the destroyer is <a href="Al-Hajjaj%20ibn%20Yusuf">Hajjaj ibn Yusuf</a>. Shias, on the other hand, regard him a sincere partisan of Ali and his family, who avenged the murder of Husayn and his company. They maintain that the allegations levelled against him regarding prophethood, his role in the Kaysanites sect, and his lust for power are Umayyad and Zubayrid propaganda.

There are differing accounts of how prominent members of the Alid family viewed Mukhtar. One account holds that Husayn's son and the fourth Shia Imam, Ali Zayn al-Abidin, prayed for him after seeing the heads of Ibn Ziyad and Umar ibn Sa'ad, while another account holds that he rejected Mukhtar's gifts and called him a liar. Husayn's grandson, <a href="Muhammad%20al-Baqir">Muhammad al-Baqir</a>, praised him: "Do not speak ill of Mukhtar, he killed our killers, sought vengeance for our blood and arranged marriages for our widows." Al-Baqir further praised him when Mukhtar's son asked al-Baqir about his opinion of Mukhtar. Husayn's great-grandson, <a href="Ja%27far%20al-Sadiq">Ja'far al-Sadiq</a>, is reported to have said: "The women of the Banu Hashim did not comb and colour [their hair] until al-Mukhtar came to us with the heads of those [who] killed Husayn". Ja'far al-Sadiq is also reported to have said that Mukhtar used to lie about Ali Zayn al-Abidin.

While early historical accounts are unanimous in portraying Mukhtar in a negative light, modern historians hold a variety of views. Wellhausen writes that although Mukhtar did not claim to be a prophet, he made every effort to create the impression that he was one, and spoke in a way as if he sat in the counsel of God. He concludes that Mukhtar was nevertheless a sincere man who tried to eradicate the social differences of his time. He further argues that Mukhtar made extravagant claims and exploited Ibn al-Hanafiyyah's name out of necessity, as he could not have achieved his goal in his own name. He calls him "... one of the greatest men of Islamic history; [who] anticipated the future". Historian <a href="Hugh%20N.%20Kennedy">Hugh Kennedy</a> writes that Mukhtar was a revolutionary who tried to put together a united Kufan coalition but was beset by internal divisions and let down by the Alid family. Before his death, Mukhtar is reported to have said: Middle East scholar <a href="Moshe%20Sharon">Moshe Sharon</a> describes this as an accurate description of his activities. Professor <a href="Abdulaziz%20Sachedina">Abdulaziz Sachedina</a>, on the other hand, calls him an ambitious politician who manipulated the religious sentiments of common people for his own good.

As with <a href="Maqtal%20al-Husayn">Maqtal-namas</a> narrating the story of Karbala, various Mukhtar-namas elaborating on the life and movement of Mukhtar, were written during the <a href="Safavid%20dynasty">Safavid era</a>. An Iranian television series, "<a href="Mokhtarnameh">Mokhtar Nameh</a>", based on the Shia perspective of his life and revolt, was produced in 2009.

Scotland in the High Middle Ages

The High Middle Ages of Scotland encompass <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> in the era between the death of <a href="Donald%20II%20of%20Scotland">Domnall II</a> in 900 AD and the death of King <a href="Alexander%20III%20of%20Scotland">Alexander III</a> in 1286, which was an indirect cause of the <a href="Scottish%20Wars%20of%20Independence">Scottish Wars of Independence</a>.

At the close of the ninth century, various competing kingdoms occupied the territory of modern Scotland. <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>n influence was dominant in the northern and western islands, <a href="Britons%20%28historical%29">Brythonic</a> culture in the southwest, the Anglo-Saxon or English <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Northumbria">Kingdom of Northumbria</a> in the southeast and the <a href="Picts">Pictish</a> and <a href="Gaels">Gaelic</a> <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Alba">Kingdom of Alba</a> in the east, north of the <a href="River%20Forth">River Forth</a>. By the tenth and eleventh centuries, northern <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> was increasingly dominated by Gaelic culture, and by the Gaelic regal lordship of "<a href="Alba">Alba</a>", known in <a href="Latin">Latin</a> as either "Albania" or "<a href="Scotia">Scotia</a>", and in <a href="English%20language">English</a> as "Scotland". From its base in the east, this kingdom acquired control of the lands lying to the south and ultimately the west and much of the north. It had a flourishing culture, comprising part of the larger Gaelic-speaking world and an economy dominated by agriculture and trade.

After the twelfth-century reign of <a href="David%20I%20of%20Scotland">King David I</a>, the <a href="Scottish%20monarchs">Scottish monarchs</a> are better described as <a href="Scoto-Norman">Scoto-Norman</a> than Gaelic, preferring <a href="French%20culture">French culture</a> to native Scottish culture. A consequence was the spread of French institutions and social values including <a href="Canon%20law%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">Canon law</a>. The first towns, called <a href="burghs">burghs</a>, appeared in the same era, and as they spread, so did the <a href="Middle%20English%20language">Middle English language</a>. These developments were offset by the acquisition of the <a href="Norse-Gaels">Norse-Gaelic</a> west and the <a href="Gaelicisation">Gaelicisation</a> of many of the noble families of <a href="French%20people">French</a> and <a href="Normans">Anglo-French</a> origin. National cohesion was fostered with the creation of various unique religious and cultural practices. By the end of the period, Scotland experienced a "Gaelic revival", which created an integrated <a href="Scottish%20national%20identity">Scottish national identity</a>. By 1286, these economic, institutional, cultural, religious and legal developments had brought Scotland closer to its neighbours in <a href="England">England</a> and <a href="continental%20Europe">the Continent</a>, although outsiders continued to view Scotland as a provincial, even savage place. By this date, the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Kingdom of Scotland</a> had political boundaries that closely resembled those of the modern nation.

<a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> in the High Middle Ages is a relatively well-studied topic and Scottish medievalists have produced a wide variety of publications. Some, such as <a href="David%20Dumville">David Dumville</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Owen%20Clancy">Thomas Owen Clancy</a> and <a href="Dauvit%20Broun">Dauvit Broun</a>, are primarily interested in the native cultures of the country, and often have linguistic training in the <a href="Celtic%20languages">Celtic languages</a>. Normanists, such as <a href="G.W.S.%20Barrow">G.W.S. Barrow</a>, are concerned with the <a href="Normans">Norman</a> and <a href="Scoto-Norman">Scoto-Norman</a> cultures introduced to Scotland after the eleventh century. For much of the twentieth century, historians tended to stress the cultural change that took place in Scotland during this time. However, scholars such as <a href="Cynthia%20Neville">Cynthia Neville</a> and <a href="Richard%20Oram">Richard Oram</a>, while not ignoring cultural changes, argue that continuity with the <a href="Gaels">Gaelic</a> past was just as, if not more, important.

Since the publication of "Scandinavian Scotland" by Barbara E. Crawford in 1987, there has been a growing volume of work dedicated to the understanding of Norse influence in this period. However, from 849 on, when <a href="Columba">Columba</a>'s relics were removed from <a href="Iona">Iona</a> in the face of Viking incursions, written evidence from local sources in the areas under <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>n influence all but vanishes for three hundred years. The sources for information about the <a href="Hebrides">Hebrides</a> and indeed much of northern Scotland from the eighth to the eleventh century, are thus almost exclusively Irish, English or Norse. The main Norse texts were written in the early thirteenth century and should be treated with care. The English and Irish sources are more contemporary, but according to historian <a href="Alex%20Woolf">Alex Woolf</a>, may have "led to a southern bias in the story", especially as much of the Hebridean archipelago became Norse-speaking during this period.

There are various traditional clan histories dating from the nineteenth century such as the "monumental" "The Clan Donald" and a significant corpus of material from the Gaelic oral tradition that relates to this period, although their value is questionable.

At the close of the ninth century various polities occupied Scotland. The <a href="Picts">Pictish</a> and Gaelic <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Alba">Kingdom of Alba</a> had just been united in the east; the Scandinavian-influenced <a href="Kingdom%20of%20the%20Isles">Kingdom of the Isles</a> emerged in the west. <a href="Ragnall%20ua%20%C3%8Dmair">Ragnall ua Ímair</a> was a key figure at this time although the extent to which he ruled territory in western and northern Scotland including the Hebrides and <a href="Northern%20Isles">Northern Isles</a> is unknown as contemporary sources are silent on this matter. <a href="Dumbarton%20Castle">Dumbarton</a>, the capital of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Strathclyde">Kingdom of Strathclyde</a> had been sacked by the <a href="U%C3%AD%20%C3%8Dmair">Uí Ímair</a> in 870. This was clearly a major assault, which may have brought the whole of mainland Scotland under temporary Uí Imair control. The south-east had been absorbed by the <a href="England">English</a> <a href="Bernicia">Kingdom of Bernicia/Northumbria</a> in the seventh century. <a href="Galloway">Galloway</a> in the south west was a Lordship with some regality. In a <a href="Galwegian%20Gaelic">Galwegian</a> charter dated to the reign of <a href="Fergus%20of%20Galloway">Fergus</a>, the Galwegian ruler styled himself "rex Galwitensium", King of Galloway. In the north east the <a href="Mormaer%20of%20Moray">ruler of Moray</a> was called not only "king" in both Scandinavian and Irish sources, but before <a href="M%C3%A1el%20Snechtai%20of%20Moray">Máel Snechtai</a>, "King of Alba".

However, when <a href="Donald%20II%20of%20Scotland">Domnall mac Causantín</a> died at <a href="Dunnotar%20Castle">Dunnottar</a> in 900, he was the first man to be recorded as "rí Alban" and his kingdom was the nucleus that would expand as Viking and other influences waned. In the tenth century the <a href="Alba">Alba</a>n elite had begun to develop a conquest myth to explain their increasing <a href="Gaelicisation">Gaelicisation</a> at the expense of Pictish culture. Known as <a href="MacAlpin%27s%20treason">MacAlpin's Treason</a>, it describes how <a href="Kenneth%20I%20of%20Scotland">Cináed mac Ailpín</a> is supposed to have annihilated the Picts in one fell takeover. However, modern historians are now beginning to reject this conceptualization of Scottish origins. No contemporary sources mention this conquest. Moreover, the Gaelicisation of Pictland was a long process predating Cináed, and is evidenced by Gaelic-speaking Pictish rulers, Pictish royal patronage of Gaelic poets, and Gaelic inscriptions and placenames. The change of identity can perhaps be explained by the death of the <a href="Pictish%20language">Pictish language</a>, but also important may be <a href="Constantine%20II%20of%20Scotland">Causantín II</a>'s alleged Scoticisation of the "Pictish" Church and the trauma caused by <a href="Viking">Viking</a> invasions, most strenuously felt in the Pictish kingdom's heartland of <a href="Fortriu">Fortriu</a>.

The Kingdom of the Isles comprised the Hebrides, the <a href="Islands%20of%20the%20Clyde">islands of the Firth of Clyde</a> and the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a> from the 9th to the 13th centuries AD. The islands were known to the Norse as the "Suðreyjar", or "Southern Isles" as distinct from the "Norðreyjar" or "<a href="Northern%20Isles">Northern Isles</a>" of <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a> and <a href="Shetland">Shetland</a>, which were held by the <a href="Earl%20of%20Orkney">Earls of Orkney</a> as vassals of the Norwegian crown throughout the High Middle Ages.
After Ragnall ua Ímair, <a href="Amla%C3%ADb%20Cuar%C3%A1n">Amlaíb Cuarán</a>, who fought at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Brunanburh">Battle of Brunanburh</a> in 937 and who also became <a href="King%20of%20Northumbria">King of Northumbria</a>, is the next King of the Isles on record. In the succeeding years Norse sources also list various rulers such as <a href="Gilli%20%28Hebridean%20earl%29">Gilli</a>, <a href="Sigurd%20the%20Stout">Sigurd the Stout</a>, <a href="H%C3%A5kon%20Eiriksson">Håkon Eiriksson</a> and <a href="Thorfinn%20the%20Mighty">Thorfinn Sigurdsson</a> as rulers over the Hebrides as vassals of the Kings of Norway or Denmark.

<a href="Godred%20Crovan">Godred Crovan</a> became the ruler of Dublin and Mann from 1079 and from the early years of the twelfth century the <a href="Crovan%20dynasty">Crovan dynasty</a> asserted themselves and ruled as "Kings of Mann and the Isles" for the next half century. The kingdom was then sundered due to the actions of <a href="Somerled">Somerled</a> whose sons inherited the southern Hebrides while the Manx rulers held on to the "north isles" for another century.

The Scandinavian influence in Scotland was probably at its height in the mid eleventh century during the time of Thorfinn Sigurdsson, who attempted to create a single political and ecclesiastical domain stretching from Shetland to Man. The permanent Scandinavian holdings in Scotland at that time must therefore have been at least a quarter of the land area of modern Scotland.

By the end of the eleventh century the Norwegian crown had come to accept that Caithness was held by the Earls of Orkney as a fiefdom from the Kings of Scotland although its Norse character was retained throughout the thirteenth century. <a href="Raghnall%20mac%20Gofraidh">Raghnall mac Gofraidh</a> was granted Caithness after assisting the Scots king in a conflict with <a href="Harald%20Maddadson">Harald Maddadson</a>, an earl of Orkney in the early thirteenth century.

In the ninth century Orcadian control stretched into Moray, which was a semi-independent kingdom for much of this early period. The Moray rulers <a href="Macbeth%20of%20Scotland">Macbeth</a> (1040–1057) and his successor <a href="Lulach%20of%20Scotland">Lulach</a> (1057–1058) became rulers of the entire Scottish kingdom for a time. However, Moray was subjugated by the Scottish kings after 1130, when the native ruler, <a href="%C3%93engus%20of%20Moray">Óengus of Moray</a> was killed leading a rebellion. Another revolt in 1187 was equally unsuccessful.

By the mid tenth century Amlaíb Cuarán controlled <a href="Wigtownshire">The Rhinns</a> and the region gets the modern name of Galloway from the mixture of Viking and Gaelic Irish settlement that produced the Gall-Gaidel. <a href="Magnus%20III%20of%20Norway">Magnus Barelegs</a> is said to have "subdued the people of Galloway" in the eleventh century and <a href="Whithorn">Whithorn</a> seems to have been a centre of Hiberno-Norse artisans who traded around the <a href="Irish%20Sea">Irish Sea</a> by the end of the first millennium. However, the place name, written and archaeological evidence of extensive Norse (as opposed to <a href="Norse-Gaels">Norse-Gael</a>) settlement in the area is not convincing.

The ounceland system seems to have become widespread down the west coast including much of Argyll, and most of the south west apart from a region near the inner <a href="Solway%20Firth">Solway Firth</a>. In <a href="Dumfries%20and%20Galloway">Dumfries and Galloway</a> the place name evidence is complex and of mixed Gaelic, Norse and <a href="Danish%20language">Danish</a> influence, the last most likely stemming from contact with the extensive Danish holdings in northern England. Although the Scots obtained greater control after the death of <a href="Gille%20Brigte%2C%20Lord%20of%20Galloway">Gilla Brigte</a> and the accession of <a href="Lochlann%2C%20Lord%20of%20Galloway">Lochlann</a> in 1185, Galloway was not fully absorbed by Scotland until 1235, after the <a href="Gilla%20Ruadh%20the%20Galwegian">rebellion of the Galwegians</a> was crushed.

The main language of Strathclyde and elsewhere in the "<a href="Hen%20Ogledd">Hen Ogledd</a>" in the opening years of the High Middle Ages was <a href="Cumbric%20language">Cumbric</a>, a variety of the <a href="Brythonic%20languages">British language</a> akin to <a href="Old%20Welsh">Old Welsh</a>. Some time after 1018 and before 1054, the kingdom appears to have been conquered by the Scots, most probably during the reign of <a href="Malcolm%20II%20of%20Scotland">Máel Coluim mac Cináeda</a> who died in 1034. At this time the territory of Strathclyde extended as far south as the <a href="River%20Derwent%2C%20Cumbria">River Derwent</a>. In 1054, the English king <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a> dispatched Earl <a href="Siward%20of%20Northumbria">Siward of Northumbria</a> against the Scots, then ruled by <a href="Macbeth%20of%20Scotland">Macbeth</a>. By the 1070s, if not earlier in the reign of <a href="Malcolm%20III%20of%20Scotland">Máel Coluim mac Donnchada</a>, it appears that the Scots again controlled Strathclyde, although <a href="William%20Rufus">William Rufus</a> annexed the southern portion in 1092. The territory was granted by Alexander I to his brother David, later <a href="David%20I%20of%20Scotland">King David I</a>, in 1107.

Domnall mac Causantín's nickname was "dásachtach". This simply meant a madman, or, in early Irish law, a man not in control of his functions and hence without legal culpability. The following long reign (900–942/3) of his successor <a href="Constantine%20II%20of%20Scotland">Causantín</a> is more often regarded as the key to formation of the Kingdom of Alba.

The period between the accession of <a href="Malcolm%20I%20of%20Scotland">Máel Coluim I</a> and Máel Coluim mac Cináeda was marked by good relations with the <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a> <a href="Kings%20of%20England">rulers of England</a>, intense internal dynastic disunity and, despite this, relatively successful expansionary policies. In 945, king Máel Coluim I received <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Strathclyde">Strathclyde</a> as part of a deal with King <a href="Edmund%20I%20of%20England">Edmund of England</a>, an event offset somewhat by Máel Coluim's loss of control in Moray. Sometime in the reign of king <a href="Indulf%20of%20Scotland">Idulb</a> (954–962), the Scots captured the fortress called "oppidum Eden", i.e. <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>. Scottish control of <a href="Lothian">Lothian</a> was strengthened with Máel Coluim II's victory over the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Northumbria">Northumbrians</a> at the Battle of Carham (1018). The Scots had probably some authority in Strathclyde since the later part of the ninth century, but the kingdom kept its own rulers, and it is not clear that the Scots were always strong enough to enforce their authority.

The reign of King <a href="Duncan%20I%20of%20Scotland">Donnchad I</a> from 1034 was marred by failed military adventures, and he was killed in a battle with the men of Moray, led by <a href="Macbeth%2C%20King%20of%20Scotland">Macbeth</a> who became king in 1040. Macbeth ruled for seventeen years, peaceful enough that he was able to leave to go on <a href="pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="Rome">Rome</a>; however, he was overthrown by <a href="Malcolm%20III%20of%20Scotland">Máel Coluim</a>, the son of Donnchad, who some months later defeated Macbeth's stepson and successor Lulach to become king Máel Coluim III. In subsequent medieval <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a>, Donnchad's reign was portrayed positively while Macbeth was vilified; <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> followed this distorted history with his portrayal of both the king and his <a href="queen%20consort">queen consort</a>, <a href="Gruoch%20of%20Scotland">Gruoch</a>, in his play "<a href="Macbeth">Macbeth</a>".
It was Máel Coluim III, not his father Donnchad, who did more to create the <a href="House%20of%20Dunkeld">dynasty</a> that ruled Scotland for the following two centuries. Part of the resource was the large number of children he had, perhaps as many as a dozen, through marriage to the widow or daughter of Thorfinn Sigurdsson and afterwards to the Anglo-Hungarian princess <a href="Saint%20Margaret%20of%20Scotland">Margaret</a>, granddaughter of <a href="Edmund%20Ironside">Edmund Ironside</a>. However, despite having a royal <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> wife, Máel Coluim spent much of his reign conducting <a href="Slavery">slave</a> raids against the English, adding to the woes of that people in the aftermath of the <a href="Norman%20Conquest%20of%20England">Norman Conquest of England</a> and the <a href="Harrying%20of%20the%20North">Harrying of the North</a>. <a href="Marianus%20Scotus">Marianus Scotus</a> narrates that "the Gaels and French devastated the English; and [the English] were dispersed and died of hunger; and were compelled to eat human flesh".

Máel Coluim's Queen Margaret was the sister of the native claimant to the English throne, <a href="Edgar%20the%20%C3%86theling">Edgar Ætheling</a>. This marriage, and Máel Coluim's raids on northern England, prompted interference by the Norman rulers of England in the Scottish kingdom. King <a href="William%20I%20of%20England">William the Conqueror</a> invaded and Máel Coluim submitted to his authority, giving his oldest son Donnchad as a hostage. From 1079 onwards there were various cross border raids by both parties and Máel Coluim himself and Edward, his eldest son by Margaret, died in one of them in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Alnwick%20%281093%29">Battle of Alnwick</a>, in 1093.

Tradition would have made his brother <a href="Donald%20III%20of%20Scotland">Domnall Bán</a> Máel Coluim's successor, but it seems that Edward, his eldest son by Margaret, was his chosen heir. With Máel Coluim and Edward dead in the same battle, and his other sons in Scotland still young, Domnall was made king. However, <a href="Duncan%20II%20of%20Scotland">Donnchad II</a>, Máel Coluim's eldest son by his first wife, obtained some support from <a href="William%20II%20of%20England">William Rufus</a> and took the throne. According to the "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>" his English and French followers were massacred, and Donnchad II himself was killed later in the same year (1094) by Domnall's ally <a href="M%C3%A1el%20Petair%20of%20Mearns">Máel Petair of Mearns</a>. In 1097, William Rufus sent another of Máel Coluim's sons, <a href="Edgar%20of%20Scotland">Edgar</a>, to take the kingship. The ensuing death of Domnall Bán secured the kingship for Edgar, and there followed a period of relative peace. The reigns of both Edgar and his successor <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Scotland">Alexander</a> are obscure by comparison with their successors. The former's most notable act was to send a <a href="camel">camel</a> (or perhaps an <a href="elephant">elephant</a>) to his fellow Gael <a href="Muircheartach%20Ua%20Briain">Muircheartach Ua Briain</a>, <a href="High%20King%20of%20Ireland">High King of Ireland</a>. When Edgar died, Alexander took the kingship, while his youngest brother David became <a href="David%2C%20Prince%20of%20the%20Cumbrians">Prince of Cumbria</a>.

The period between the accession of <a href="David%20I%20of%20Scotland">David I</a> and the death of <a href="Alexander%20III%20of%20Scotland">Alexander III</a> was marked by dependency upon and relatively good relations with the Kings of England. The period can be regarded as one of great historical transformation, part of a more general phenomenon, which has been called "Europeanisation". The period also witnessed the successful imposition of royal authority across most of the modern country. After David I, and especially in the reign of <a href="William%20I%20of%20Scotland">William I</a>, Scotland's Kings became ambivalent about the culture of most of their subjects. As <a href="Walter%20of%20Coventry">Walter of Coventry</a> tells us, "The modern kings of Scotland count themselves as Frenchmen, in race, manners, language and culture; they keep only Frenchmen in their household and following, and have reduced the Gaels to utter servitude."

This situation was not without consequence. In the aftermath of William's capture at <a href="Alnwick">Alnwick</a> in 1174, the Scots turned on the small number of <a href="Middle%20English%20language">Middle English-speakers</a> and <a href="French%20language">French-speakers</a> among them. <a href="William%20of%20Newburgh">William of Newburgh</a> related that the Scots first attacked the Scoto-English in their own army, and Newburgh reported a repetition of these events in Scotland itself. <a href="Walter%20Bower">Walter Bower</a>, writing a few centuries later about the same events confirms that "there took place a most wretched and widespread persecution of the English both in Scotland and Galloway".
The first instance of strong opposition to the Scottish kings was perhaps the revolt of <a href="%C3%93engus%20of%20Moray">Óengus</a>, the Mormaer of Moray. Other important resistors to the expansionary Scottish kings were Somerled, <a href="Fergus%20of%20Galloway">Fergus of Galloway</a>, <a href="Gille%20Brigte%2C%20Lord%20of%20Galloway">Gille Brigte, Lord of Galloway</a> and Harald Maddadsson, along with two kin-groups known today as the <a href="MacHeths">MacHeths</a> and the <a href="Meic%20Uilleim">MacWilliams</a>. The threat from the latter was so grave that, after their defeat in 1230, the Scottish crown ordered the public execution of the infant girl who happened to be the last of the MacWilliam line. According to the "Lanercost Chronicle":
Many of these resistors collaborated, and drew support not just in the peripheral Gaelic regions of Galloway, Moray, Ross and Argyll, but also from eastern "Scotland-proper", and elsewhere in the Gaelic world. However, by the end of the twelfth century, the Scottish kings had acquired the authority and ability to draw in native Gaelic lords outside their previous zone of control in order to do their work, the most famous examples being <a href="Lochlann%2C%20Lord%20of%20Galloway">Lochlann, Lord of Galloway</a> and <a href="Fearchar%2C%20Earl%20of%20Ross">Ferchar mac in tSagairt</a>. By the reign of Alexander III, the Scots were in a strong position to annex the remainder of the western seaboard, which they did following <a href="Haakon%20IV%20of%20Norway">Haakon Haakonarson</a>'s ill-fated invasion and the stalemate of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Largs">Battle of Largs</a> with the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Perth">Treaty of Perth</a> in 1266. The conquest of the west, the creation of the <a href="Earl%20of%20Carrick">Mormaerdom of Carrick</a> in 1186 and the absorption of the <a href="Lords%20of%20Galloway">Lordship of Galloway</a> after the Galwegian revolt of <a href="Gille%20Ruadh">Gille Ruadh</a> in 1235 meant that Gaelic speakers under the rule of the Scottish king formed a majority of the population during the so-called Norman period. The integration of Gaelic, Norman and Saxon culture that began to occur may have been the platform that enabled King <a href="Robert%20I%20of%20Scotland">Robert I</a> to emerge victorious during the <a href="Scottish%20Wars%20of%20Independence">Wars of Independence</a>, which followed soon after the death of Alexander III.

At the beginning of this period the boundaries of Alba contained only a small proportion of modern Scotland. Even when these lands were added to in the tenth and eleventh centuries, the term "<a href="Scotia">Scotia</a>" was applied in sources only to the region between the <a href="River%20Forth">River Forth</a>, the central <a href="Grampian%20Mountains">Grampians</a> and the <a href="River%20Spey">River Spey</a> and only began to be used to describe all of the lands under the authority of the Scottish crown from the second half of the twelfth century. By the late thirteenth century when the <a href="Treaty%20of%20York">Treaty of York</a> (1237) and <a href="Treaty%20of%20Perth">Treaty of Perth</a> (1266) had fixed the boundaries with the Kingdom of the Scots with England and <a href="Norway">Norway</a> respectively, its borders were close to the modern boundaries. After this time both <a href="Berwick-upon-Tweed">Berwick</a> and the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a> were lost to England, and Orkney and Shetland were gained from Norway in the fifteenth century.

The area that became Scotland in this period is divided by geology into five major regions: the <a href="Southern%20Uplands">Southern Uplands</a>, <a href="Central%20Lowlands">Central Lowlands</a>, the <a href="Scottish%20Highlands">Highlands</a>, the North-east coastal plain and the <a href="Scottish%20Islands">Islands</a>. Some of these were further divided by mountains, major rivers and marshes. Most of these regions had strong cultural and economic ties elsewhere: to England, Ireland, Scandinavian and mainland Europe. Internal communications were difficult and the country lacked an obvious geographical centre. <a href="Dunfermline">Dunfermline</a> emerged as a major royal centre in the reign of Malcolm III and Edinburgh began to be used to house royal records in the reign of David I, but, perhaps because of its proximity and vulnerability to England, it did not become a formal capital in this period.

The expansion of Alba into the wider <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Kingdom of Scotland</a> was a gradual process combining external conquest and the suppression of occasional rebellions with the extension of seigniorial power through the placement of effective agents of the crown. Neighbouring independent kings became subject to Alba and eventually disappeared from the records. In the ninth century the term "<a href="mormaer">mormaer</a>", meaning "great steward", began to appear in the records to describe the rulers of Moray, <a href="Strathearn">Strathearn</a>, <a href="Buchan">Buchan</a>, <a href="Angus%2C%20Scotland">Angus</a> and <a href="Kincardineshire">Mearns</a>, who may have acted as "marcher lords" for the kingdom to counter the Viking threat. Later the process of consolidation is associated with the feudalism introduced by David I, which, particularly in the east and south where the crown's authority was greatest, saw the placement of lordships, often based on castles, and the creation of administrative <a href="sheriff">sheriff</a>doms, which overlay the pattern of local <a href="thegn">thegn</a>s. It also saw the <a href="English%20language">English</a> "earl" and <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "comes" begin to replace the "mormaers" in the records. The result has been seen as a "hybrid kingdom, in which Gaelic, Anglo-Saxon, Flemish and Norman elements all coalesced under its 'Normanised', but nevertheless native lines of kings".

The Scottish economy of this period was dominated by agriculture and by short-distance, local trade. There was an increasing amount of foreign trade in the period, as well as exchange gained by means of military plunder. By the end of this period, coins were replacing <a href="Barter">barter goods</a>, but for most of this period most exchange was done without the use of metal currency.

Most of Scotland's agricultural wealth in this period came from <a href="pastoralism">pastoralism</a>, rather than <a href="Arable%20land">arable farming</a>. Arable farming grew significantly in the "Norman period", but with geographical differences, low-lying areas being subject to more arable farming than high-lying areas such as the <a href="Scottish%20Highlands">Highlands</a>, <a href="Galloway">Galloway</a> and the <a href="Southern%20Uplands">Southern Uplands</a>. Galloway, in the words of G. W. S. Barrow, "already famous for its cattle, was so overwhelmingly pastoral, that there is little evidence in that region of land under any permanent cultivation, save along the Solway coast". The average amount of land used by a <a href="Pastoralism">husbandman</a> in Scotland might have been around 26 <a href="acres">acres</a>. The native Scots favoured pastoralism, in that Gaelic lords were happier to give away more land to French and Middle English-speaking settlers, while holding on tenaciously to upland regions, perhaps contributing to the Highland/Galloway-Lowland division that emerged in Scotland in the later Middle Ages. The main unit of land measurement in Scotland was the "davoch" (i.e. "vat"), called the "arachor" in <a href="Lennox%20%28district%29">Lennox</a> and also known as the "Scottish ploughgate". In English-speaking Lothian, it was simply <a href="ploughgate">ploughgate</a>. It may have measured about , divided into 4 "rath"s. Cattle, pigs and cheeses were among the chief foodstuffs, from a wide range of produce including sheep, fish, rye, barley, bee wax and honey.

David I established the first chartered <a href="burghs">burghs</a> in Scotland, copying the burgher charters and "Leges Burgorum" (rules governing virtually every aspect of life and work) almost verbatim from the English customs of <a href="Newcastle-Upon-Tyne">Newcastle-Upon-Tyne</a>. Early burgesses were usually <a href="Flemings">Flemish</a>, <a href="English%20people">English</a>, <a href="French%20people">French</a> and <a href="Germans">German</a>, rather than Gaelic Scots. The burgh's vocabulary was composed totally of either Germanic and French terms. The councils that ran individual burghs were individually known as "lie doussane", meaning the dozen.

The population of Scotland in this period is unknown. The first reliable information in 1755 shows the inhabitants of Scotland as 1,265,380. Best estimates put the Scottish population for earlier periods in the High Middle Ages between 500,000 and 1,000,000 people, growing from a low point to a high point.
Linguistically, the majority of people within Scotland throughout this period spoke the <a href="Middle%20Irish%20language">Gaelic</a> language, then simply called "Scottish", or in Latin, "lingua Scotica". Other languages spoken throughout this period were <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a> and English, with the <a href="Cumbric%20language">Cumbric language</a> disappearing somewhere between 900 and 1100. Pictish may have survived into this period, but the evidence is weak. After the accession of David I, or perhaps before, Gaelic ceased to be the main language of the royal court. From his reign until the end of the period, the <a href="Scottish%20monarchs">Scottish monarchs</a> probably favoured the French language, as evidenced by reports from contemporary chronicles, literature and translations of administrative documents into the French language. English, with French and Flemish, became the main language of Scottish burghs. However, they were, in Barrow's words, "scarcely more than villages ... numbered in hundreds rather than thousands".

The legal tract known as "<a href="Laws%20of%20the%20Brets%20and%20Scots">Laws of the Brets and Scots</a>", probably compiled in the reign of David I, underlines the importance of the kin group as entitled to compensation for the killing of individual members. It also lists five grades of man: "King", "mormaer", "toísech", "ócthigern" and "neyfs". The highest rank below the king, the mormaer ("great officer"), were probably about a dozen provincial rulers, later replaced by the English term <a href="earl">earl</a>. Below them the toísech (leader), appear to have managed areas of the royal demesne, or that of a mormaer or abbot, within which they would have held substantial estates, sometimes described as <a href="shire">shire</a>s and the title was probably equivalent to the later <a href="thane">thane</a>. The lowest free rank mentioned by the "Laws of the Brets and Scots", the "ócthigern" (literally, "little" or "young lord"), is a term the text does not translate into French. There were probably relatively large numbers of free peasant farmers, called husbandmen or bondmen, in the south and north of the country, but fewer in the lands between the Forth and Sutherland until the twelfth century, when landlords began to encourage the formation of such a class through paying better wages and deliberate immigration. Below the husbandmen a class of free farmers with smaller parcels of land developed, with <a href="cottar">cottar</a>s and grazing tenants (gresemen). The non-free "naviti", "neyfs" or serfs existed in various forms of service, with terms with their origins in Irish practice, including "cumelache", "cumherba" and "scoloc" who were tied to a lord's estate and unable to leave it without permission, but who records indicate often absconded for better wages or work in other regions or in the developing burghs.

The introduction of feudalism from the time of David I, not only introduced sheriffdoms that overlay the pattern of local thanes, but also meant that new tenures were held from the king, or a superior lord, in exchange for loyalty and forms of service that were usually military. However, the imposition of feudalism continued to sit beside existing system of landholding and tenure and it is not clear how this change impacted on the lives of the ordinary free and unfree workers. In places, feudalism may have tied workers more closely to the land, but the predominantly pastoral nature of Scottish agriculture may have made the imposition of a <a href="manorial%20system">manorial system</a> on the English model impracticable. Obligations appear to have been limited to occasional labour service, seasonal renders of food, hospitality and money rents.

Early Gaelic law tracts, first written down in the ninth century, reveal a society highly concerned with kinship, status, honour and the regulation of blood feuds. Scottish <a href="common%20law">common law</a> began to take shape at the end of the period, assimilating Gaelic and Celtic law with practices from Anglo-Norman England and <a href="continental%20Europe">the Continent</a>. In the twelfth century, and certainly in the thirteenth, strong continental legal influences began to have more effect, such as <a href="Canon%20law%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">Canon law</a> and various Anglo-Norman practices. Pre-fourteenth century <a href="law">law</a> among the <a href="native%20Scots">native Scots</a> is not always well attested, but extensive knowledge of <a href="Brehon%20Laws">early Gaelic Law</a> gives some basis for its reconstruction. In the earliest extant Scottish legal manuscript, there is a document called "Leges inter Brettos et Scottos". The document survives in <a href="Old%20French%20language">Old French</a>, and is almost certainly a French translation of an earlier Gaelic document. It retained a vast number of untranslated Gaelic legal terms. Later medieval legal documents, written both in Latin and <a href="Middle%20English%20language">Middle English</a>, contain more Gaelic legal terms, examples including "slains" (Old Irish "slán" or "sláinte"; exemption) and "cumherba" (Old Irish "comarba"; ecclesiastic heir).

A "Judex" (pl. "judices") represents a post-Norman continuity with the ancient Gaelic orders of lawmen called in English today "Brehons". Bearers of the office almost always have Gaelic names north of the Forth or in the south-west. "Judices" were often royal officials who supervised baronial, abbatial and other lower-ranking "courts". However, the main official of law in the post-Davidian Kingdom of the Scots was the <a href="Justiciar">Justiciar</a> who held courts and reported to the king personally. Normally, there were two Justiciarships, organised by linguistic boundaries: the Justiciar of Scotia and the Justiciar of Lothian. Sometimes Galloway had its own Justiciar too.
The office of Justiciar and Judex were just two ways that Scottish society was governed. In the earlier period, the king "delegated" power to hereditary native "officers" such as the Mormaers/Earls and Toísechs/Thanes. It was a <a href="government">government</a> of gift-giving and bardic lawmen. There were also popular courts, the "comhdhail", testament to which are dozens of placenames throughout eastern Scotland. In the Norman period, sheriffdoms and sheriffs and, to a lesser extent, bishops (see <a href="Scotland%20in%20the%20High%20Middle%20Ages%23Ecclesia%20Scoticana">below</a>) became increasingly important. The former enabled the King to effectively administer royal demesne land. During David I's reign, royal sheriffs had been established in the king's core personal territories; namely, in rough chronological order, at <a href="Roxburgh">Roxburgh</a>, <a href="Scone%2C%20Scotland">Scone</a>, <a href="Berwick-upon-Tweed">Berwick-upon-Tweed</a>, <a href="Stirling">Stirling</a> and <a href="Perth%2C%20Scotland">Perth</a>. By the reign of <a href="William%20I%20of%20Scotland">William I</a>, there may have been about 30 royal sheriffdoms, including ones at <a href="Ayr">Ayr</a> and <a href="Dumfries">Dumfries</a>, key locations on the borders of Galloway-<a href="Carrick%2C%20Scotland">Carrick</a>. As the distribution and number of sheriffdoms expanded, so did royal control. By the end of the thirteenth century, sheriffdoms had been established in westerly locations as far-flung as <a href="Wigtown">Wigtown</a>, <a href="Kintyre">Kintyre</a>, <a href="Isle%20of%20Skye">Skye</a> and <a href="Lorne%2C%20Argyll%20and%20Bute">Lorne</a>. Through these, the thirteenth-century Scottish king exercised more control over Scotland than any of his later medieval successors. The king himself was itinerant and had no "capital" as such although Scone performed a key function. By ritual tradition, all Scottish kings in this period had to be crowned there by the <a href="Mormaer%20of%20Strathearn">Mormaers of Strathearn</a> and <a href="Mormaer%20of%20Fife">Fife</a>. Although King David I tried to build up Roxburgh as a capital, in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, more charters were issued at Scone than any other location. Other popular locations were nearby Perth, Stirling, <a href="Dunfermline">Dunfermline</a> and <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>. In the earliest part of this era, <a href="Forres">Forres</a> and <a href="Dunkeld">Dunkeld</a> seem to have been the chief royal residences.

Records from the Scandinavian-held lands are much-less well documented by comparison. <a href="Udal%20law">Udal law</a> formed the basis of the <a href="legal%20system">legal system</a> and it is known that the Hebrides were taxed using the <a href="Ounceland">Ounceland</a> measure. <a href="Thing%20%28assembly%29">Althings</a> were open-air governmental assemblies that met in the presence of the "<a href="Earl%20of%20Orkney">jarl</a>" and the meetings were open to virtually all free men. At these sessions decisions were made, laws passed and complaints adjudicated. Examples include <a href="Tingwall%2C%20Shetland">Tingwall</a> and <a href="Law%20Ting%20Holm">Law Ting Holm</a> in Shetland, <a href="Dingwall">Dingwall</a> in Easter Ross, and <a href="Tynwald">Tynwald</a> on the Isle of Man.

By the twelfth century the ability of lords and the king to call on wider bodies of men beyond their household troops for major campaigns had become the "common" ("communis exertcitus") or "Scottish army" ("exercitus Scoticanus"), the result of a universal obligation based on the holding of variously named units of land. Later decrees indicated that the common army was a levy of all able-bodied freemen aged between 16 and 60, with 8-days warning. It produced relatively large numbers of men serving for a limited period, usually as unarmoured or poorly armoured bowmen and spearmen. In this period it continued to be mustered by the <a href="Mormaer">earls</a> and they often led their men in battle, as was the case in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Standard">Battle of the Standard</a> in 1138. It would continue to provide the vast majority of Scottish national armies, potentially producing tens of thousands of men for short periods of conflict, into the early modern era.

There also developed obligations that produced smaller numbers of feudal troops. The Davidian Revolution of the twelfth century was seen by Geoffrey Barrow as bringing "fundamental innovations in military organization". These included the <a href="knight%27s%20fee">knight's fee</a>, <a href="Homage%20%28feudal%29">homage and fealty</a>, as well as castle-building and the regular use of professional cavalry, as knights held castles and estates in exchange for service, providing troops on a 40-day basis. David's Norman followers and their retinues were able to provide a force of perhaps 200 mounted and armoured knights, but the vast majority of his forces were the "common army" of poorly armed infantry, capable of performing well in raiding and guerrilla warfare. Although such troops were only infrequently able to stand up to the English in the field, nonetheless they did manage to do so critically in the wars of independence at <a href="Battle%20of%20Stirling%20Bridge">Stirling Bridge</a> in 1297 and <a href="Battle%20of%20Bannockburn">Bannockburn</a> in 1314.

The Viking onslaught of the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a> was based on superior sea-power, which enabled the creation of the <a href="thalassocracy">thalassocracies</a> of the north and west. In the late tenth century the naval battle of "Innisibsolian" (tentatively identified as taking place near the <a href="Slate%20Islands">Slate Islands</a> of Argyll) was won by Alban forces over Vikings, although this was an unusual setback for the Norse. In 962 <a href="Indulf">Ildulb mac Causantín</a>, King of Scots, was killed (according to the "<a href="Chronicle%20of%20the%20Kings%20of%20Alba">Chronicle of the Kings of Alba</a>") fighting the Norse near <a href="Cullen%2C%20Moray">Cullen</a>, at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bauds">Battle of Bauds</a>, and although there is no evidence of permanent Viking settlement on the east coast of Scotland south of the Moray Firth, raids and even invasions certainly occurred. <a href="Dunnottar%20Castle">Dunnottar</a> was taken during the reign of <a href="Donald%20II%20of%20Scotland">Domnall mac Causantín</a> and the "Orkneyinga saga" records an attack on the <a href="Isle%20of%20May">Isle of May</a>, by <a href="Sweyn%20Asleifsson">Sweyn Asleifsson</a> and Margad Grimsson.
The <a href="Viking%20ships">long-ship</a>, the key to their success, was a graceful, long, narrow, light, wooden boat with a shallow draft hull designed for speed. This shallow draft allowed navigation in waters only one metre deep and permitted beach landings, while its light weight enabled it to be carried over <a href="portage">portage</a>s. Longships were also double-ended, the symmetrical bow and stern allowing the ship to reverse direction quickly without having to turn around. In the "<a href="G%C3%A0idhealtachd">Gàidhealtachd</a>" they were eventually succeeded by the <a href="Birlinn">Birlinn</a>, highland <a href="galley">galley</a> and <a href="lymphad">lymphad</a>, which, in ascending order of size, and which replaced the steering-board with a stern-rudder from the late twelfth century. Forces of ships were raised through obligations of a ship-levy through the system of ouncelands and pennylands, which have been argued to date back to the muster system of Dál Riata, but were probably introduced by Scandinavian settlers. Later evidence suggests that the supply of ships for war became linked to military <a href="feudal%20obligations">feudal obligations</a>. Viking naval power was disrupted by conflicts between the Scandinavian kingdoms, but entered a period of resurgence in the 13th century when Norwegian kings began to build some of the largest ships seen in Northern European waters, until Haakon Haakonson's ill-fated expedition in 1263 left the Scottish crown the most significant power in the region.

By the tenth century all of northern Britain was Christianised, except the Scandinavian north and west, which had been lost to the church in the face of Norse settlement.

Like every other Christian country, one of the main features of medieval Scottish Christianity was the <a href="Saint">Cult of Saints</a>. Saints of Irish origin who were particularly revered included various figures called <a href="Fillan">St Faelan</a> and <a href="St.%20Colman%20%28disambiguation%29">St. Colman</a>, and saints <a href="Finbarr%20of%20Cork">Findbar</a> and <a href="Finan">Finan</a>. The most important missionary saint was <a href="Columba">Columba</a>, who emerged as a national figure in the combined Scottish and Pictish kingdom, with a new centre established in the east at <a href="Dunkeld">Dunkeld</a> by Kenneth I for part of his relics. He remained a major figure into the fourteenth century and a new foundation was endowed by William I at <a href="Arbroath%20Abbey">Arbroath Abbey</a> and the relics in the <a href="Monymusk%20Reliquary">Monymusk Reliquary</a> handed over to the Abbot's care. Regional saints remained important to local identities. In Strathclyde the most important saint was <a href="St%20Kentigern">St Kentigern</a>, in Lothian, <a href="St%20Cuthbert">St Cuthbert</a> and after this martyrdom around 1115 a cult emerged in Orkney, Shetland and northern Scotland around <a href="Magnus%20Erlendsson%2C%20Earl%20of%20Orkney">Magnus Erlendsson, Earl of Orkney</a>. The cult of <a href="St%20Andrew">St Andrew</a> in Scotland was established on the Eastern coast by the Pictish kings as early as the eighth century. The shrine, which from the twelfth century was said to have contained the relics of the saint, brought to Scotland by <a href="Saint%20Regulus">Saint Regulus</a>, began to attract pilgrims from Scotland, but also from England and further away. By the twelfth century the site at Kilrymont, had become known simply as <a href="St.%20Andrews">St. Andrews</a> and it became increasingly associated with <a href="Scottish%20national%20identity">Scottish national identity</a> and the royal family. It was renewed as a focus for devotion with the patronage of Queen Margaret, who also became important after her canonisation in 1250 and the ceremonial transfer of her remains to <a href="Dunfermline%20Abbey">Dunfermline Abbey</a>, as one of the most revered national saints.

There is some evidence that Christianity made inroads into the Viking controlled <a href="Highlands%20and%20Islands">Highlands and Islands</a> before the official conversion at the end of the tenth century. There are a relatively large number of isles called Pabbay or Papa in the Western and Northern Isles, which may indicate a "hermit's" or "priest's isle" from this period. Changes in patterns of grave goods and the use of Viking place names using -kirk also suggest that the Christianity had begun to spread before the official conversion. According to the "Orkneyinga Saga" the Northern Isles were Christianised by <a href="Olaf%20I%20of%20Norway">Olav Tryggvasson</a> in 995 when he stopped at <a href="South%20Walls">South Walls</a> on his way from Ireland to Norway. The King summoned the "<a href="earl">jarl</a>" <a href="Sigurd%20the%20Stout">Sigurd the Stout</a> and said "I order you and all your subjects to be baptised. If you refuse, I'll have you killed on the spot and I swear I will ravage every island with fire and steel." Unsurprisingly, Sigurd agreed and the islands became Christian at a stroke, receiving their own <a href="Bishop%20of%20Orkney">bishop</a> in the early eleventh century. Elsewhere in Scandinavian Scotland the record is less clear. There was a <a href="Bishop%20of%20the%20Isles">Bishop of Iona</a> until the late tenth century and there is then a gap of more than a century, possibly filled by the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Orkney">Bishops of Orkney</a>, before the appointment of the first <a href="Diocese%20of%20the%20Isles">Bishop of Mann</a> in 1079.
At the beginning of the period Scottish monasticism was dominated by <a href="monks">monks</a> called "Céli Dé" (lit. "vassals of God"), anglicised as <a href="culdees">culdees</a>. At St Andrews and elsewhere, "Céli Dé" abbeys are recorded and the round towers at <a href="Brechin">Brechin</a> and <a href="Abernethy%2C%20Perth%20and%20Kinross">Abernethy</a> are evidence of Irish influence. Gaelic monasticism was vibrant and expansionary for much of the period and dozens of monasteries, often called <a href="Schottenkl%C3%B6ster">Schottenklöster</a>, were founded by Gaelic monks on the continent. The introduction of the continental type of monasticism to Scotland is associated with Queen Margaret, the wife of Máel Coluim III, although her exact role is unclear. She was in communication with <a href="Lanfranc">Lanfranc</a>, Archbishop of Canterbury, and he provided a few monks for a new <a href="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> <a href="Dunfermline%20Abbey">abbey at Dunfermline</a> (c. 1070). Subsequent foundations under Margaret's sons, the kings Edgar, Alexander I and particularly David I, tended to be of the reformed type that followed the lead set by <a href="Cluniac%20Reforms">Cluny</a>. These stressed the original Benedictine virtues of <a href="poverty%2C%20chastity%20and%20obedience">poverty, chastity and obedience</a>, but also contemplation and service of the Mass and were followed in various forms by large numbers of reformed Benedictine, <a href="Augustinian">Augustinian</a> and <a href="Cistercian">Cistercian</a> houses.

Before the twelfth century most Scottish churches had collegiate bodies of clergy who served over a wide area, often tied together by devotion to a particular missionary saint. From this period local lay landholders, perhaps following the example of David I, began to adopt the continental practice of building churches on their land for the local population and endowing them with land and a priest, beginning in the south, spreading to the north-east and then the west, being almost universal by the first survey of the Scottish Church for papal taxation in 1274. The administration of these parishes was often given over to local monastic institutions in a process known as appropriation. Scotland had little clear diocesan structure before the Norman period. There were bishoprics based on various ancient churches, but some are very obscure in the records and there appear to be long vacancies. From around 1070, in the reign of Malcolm III, there was a "Bishop of Alba" resident at St. Andrews, but it is not clear what authority he had over the other bishops. After the <a href="Norman%20Conquest%20of%20England">Norman Conquest of England</a>, the <a href="Archbishop">Archbishop</a>s of both <a href="Archbishopric%20of%20Canterbury">Canterbury</a> and <a href="Archbishopric%20of%20York">York</a> each claimed superiority over the Scottish church. The church in Scotland attained independent status after the <a href="Papal%20Bull">Papal Bull</a> of <a href="Celestine%20III">Celestine III</a> ("Cum universi", 1192) by which all Scottish bishoprics except Galloway were formally independent of York and Canterbury. However, unlike Ireland, which had been granted four Archbishoprics in the same century, Scotland received no Archbishop and the whole "Ecclesia Scoticana", with individual Scottish bishoprics (except Whithorn/Galloway), became the "special daughter of the see of Rome". It was in practice run by special councils made up of all its bishops, with the bishop of St Andrews emerging as the most important player.

As a predominantly Gaelic society, most Scottish cultural practices throughout this period mirrored closely those of <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a>, or at least those of Ireland with some Pictish borrowings. After David I, the French-speaking kings introduced cultural practices popular in Anglo-Norman England, France and elsewhere. As in all pre-modern societies, storytelling was popular. The English scholar D. D. R. Owen, who specialises in the literature of this era, writes that "Professional storytellers would ply their trade from court to court. Some of them would have been native Scots, no doubt offering legends from the ancient Celtic past performed ... in Gaelic when appropriate, but in French for most of the new nobility". Almost all of these stories are lost, although some have come down in the Gaelic or <a href="Scots%20language">Scots</a> oral tradition. One form of oral culture extremely well accounted for in this period is <a href="genealogy">genealogy</a>. There are dozens of Scottish genealogies surviving from this era, covering everyone from the <a href="Mormaer%20of%20Lennox">Mormaers of Lennox</a> and <a href="Mormaer%20of%20Moray">Moray</a> to the Scottish king himself. Scotland's kings maintained an "ollamh righe", a royal high poet who had a permanent place in all medieval Gaelic lordships, and whose purpose was to recite genealogies when needed, for occasions such as coronations.

Before the reign of David I, the Scots possessed a flourishing literary elite who regularly produced texts in both Gaelic and Latin that were frequently transmitted to Ireland and elsewhere. Dauvit Broun has shown that a Gaelic literary elite survived in the eastern Scottish lowlands, in places such as <a href="Loch%20Leven%20%28Kinross%29">Loch Leven</a> and <a href="Brechin">Brechin</a> into the thirteenth century, However, surviving records are predominantly written in Latin, and their authors would usually translate vernacular terms into Latin, so that historians are faced with researching a Gaelic society clothed in Latin terminology. Even names were translated into more common continental forms; for instance, "Gilla Brigte" became "Gilbert", "Áed" became "Hugh", etc. As far as written literature is concerned, there may be more medieval Scottish Gaelic literature than is often thought. Almost all medieval Gaelic literature has survived because it was sustained in <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a>, not in Scotland. Thomas Owen Clancy has recently all but proven that the "<a href="Lebor%20Bretnach">Lebor Bretnach</a>", the so-called "Irish Nennius", was written in Scotland, and probably at the monastery in Abernethy. Yet this text survives only from manuscripts preserved in Ireland. Other literary work that has survived include that of the prolific poet <a href="Gille%20Brighde%20Albanach">Gille Brighde Albanach</a>. About 1218, Gille Brighde wrote a poem — "Heading for Damietta" — on his experiences of the <a href="Fifth%20Crusade">Fifth Crusade</a>. In the thirteenth century, <a href="Old%20French%20language">French</a> flourished as a <a href="literary%20language">literary language</a>, and produced the "<a href="Roman%20de%20Fergus">Roman de Fergus</a>", one of the earliest pieces of non-Celtic <a href="vernacular">vernacular</a> literature to survive from Scotland.

There is no extant literature in the English language in this era. There is some Norse literature from Scandinavian parts such as "<a href="Darra%C3%B0arlj%C3%B3%C3%B0">Darraðarljóð</a>", which is located in <a href="Caithness">Caithness</a>, the story being a "powerful mixture of Celtic and Old Norse imagery". The famous "<a href="Orkneyinga%20Saga">Orkneyinga Saga</a>", which pertains to the early history of the <a href="Earldom%20of%20Orkney">Earldom of Orkney</a>, was written down in <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>.
In the Middle Ages, Scotland was renowned for its musical skill. <a href="Gerald%20of%20Wales">Gerald of Wales</a>, a medieval clergyman and chronicler, explains the relation between Scottish and Irish music:
Playing the <a href="harp">harp</a> ("clarsach") was especially popular with medieval Scots – half a century after Gerald's writing, King Alexander III kept a royal harpist at his court. Of the three medieval harps that survive, two come from Scotland (Perthshire), and one from Ireland. Singers also had a royal function. For instance, when the king of Scotland passed through the territory of Strathearn, it was the custom that he be greeted by seven female singers, who would sing to him. When Edward I approached the borders of Strathearn in the summer of 1296, he was met by these seven women, "who accompanied the King on the road between <a href="Gask">Gask</a> and <a href="Ogilvie%2C%20Angus">Ogilvie</a>, singing to him, as was the custom in the time of the late Alexander kings of Scots".

The Irish thought of Scotland as a provincial place. Others thought of it as an outlandish or barbaric place. "Who would deny that the Scots are barbarians?" was a rhetorical question posed by the author of the "De expugnatione Lyxbonensi" (i.e. "On the Conquest of Lisbon"). A century later <a href="Louis%20IX">Louis IX</a> of France was reported to have said to his son "I would prefer that a Scot should come from Scotland and govern the people well and faithfully, than that you, my son, should be seen to govern badly."

This characterisation of the Scots was often politically motivated, and many of the most hostile writers were based in areas frequently subjected to Scottish raids. English and French accounts of the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Standard">Battle of the Standard</a> contain many accounts of Scottish atrocities. For instance, <a href="Henry%20of%20Huntingdon">Henry of Huntingdon</a> notes that the Scots: "cleft open pregnant women, and took out the unborn babes; they tossed children upon the spear-points, and beheaded priests on altars: they cut the head of crucifixes, and placed them on the trunks of the slain; and placed the heads of the dead upon the crucifixes. Thus wherever the Scots arrived, all was full of horror and full of savagery." A less hostile view was given by <a href="Guibert%20of%20Nogent">Guibert of Nogent</a> in the <a href="First%20Crusade">First Crusade</a>, who encountered Scots and wrote that: "You might have seen a crowd of Scots, a people savage at home but unwarlike elsewhere, descend from their marshy lands, with bare legs, shaggy cloaks, their purse hanging from their shoulders; their copious arms seemed ridiculous to us, but they offered their faith and devotion as aid."

There was also a general belief that Scotland-proper was an island, or at least a <a href="peninsula">peninsula</a>, known as Scotia, Alba or Albania. <a href="Matthew%20Paris">Matthew Paris</a>, a <a href="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> monk and cartographer, drew a map in this manner in the mid-thirteenth century and called the "island" "Scotia ultra marina". A later medieval Italian map applies this geographical conceptualization to all of Scotland. The Arab geographer <a href="Muhammad%20al-Idrisi">al-Idrisi</a>, shared this view: "Scotland adjoins the island of England and is a long peninsula to the north of the larger island. It is uninhabited and has neither town nor village. Its length is 150 miles."

In this period, the word "Scot" was not the word used by vast majority of Scots to describe themselves, except to foreigners, among whom it was the most common word. The Scots called themselves "Albanach" or simply "Gaidel". Both "Scot" and "Gaidel" were ethnic terms that connected them to the majority of the inhabitants of Ireland. As the author of "<a href="De%20Situ%20Albanie">De Situ Albanie</a>" notes at the beginning of the thirteenth century: "The name Arregathel [Argyll] means margin of the Scots or Irish, because all Scots and Irish are generally called 'Gattheli'."

Likewise, the inhabitants of English and Norse-speaking parts were ethnically linked with other regions of Europe. At <a href="Melrose%2C%20Scotland">Melrose</a>, people could recite religious literature in the English language. In the later part of the twelfth century, the Lothian writer <a href="Adam%20of%20Dryburgh">Adam of Dryburgh</a> describes Lothian as "the Land of the English in the Kingdom of the Scots". In the Northern Isles the Norse language evolved into the local <a href="Norn%20language">Norn</a>, which lingered until the end of the eighteenth century, when it finally died out and Norse may also have survived as a spoken language until the sixteenth century in the <a href="Outer%20Hebrides">Outer Hebrides</a>.

Scotland came to possess a unity that transcended Gaelic, English, Norman and Norse ethnic differences and by the end of the period, the Latin, Norman-French and English word "Scot" could be used for any subject of the Scottish king. Scotland's multilingual <a href="Scoto-Norman">Scoto-Norman</a> monarchs and mixed Gaelic and Scoto-Norman aristocracy all became part of the "Community of the Realm", in which ethnic differences were less divisive than in Ireland and Wales.

Marian Rejewski

Marian Adam Rejewski (; 16 August 1905 – 13 February 1980) was a Polish <a href="mathematician">mathematician</a> and <a href="cryptography">cryptologist</a> who reconstructed the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi German</a> military <a href="Enigma%20machine">Enigma cipher machine</a> sight-unseen in 1932. The cryptologic achievements of Rejewski and colleagues <a href="Jerzy%20R%C3%B3%C5%BCycki">Jerzy Różycki</a> and <a href="Henryk%20Zygalski">Henryk Zygalski</a> enabled the British to begin reading German Enigma-encrypted messages at the start of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, seven years after Rejewski's original reconstruction of the machine. The intelligence that was gained by the British from Enigma decrypts formed part of what was code-named <a href="Ultra%20%28cryptography%29">Ultra</a> and contributed—perhaps decisively—to the <a href="End%20of%20World%20War%20II%20in%20Europe">defeat of Germany</a>.

In 1929, while studying mathematics at <a href="Adam%20Mickiewicz%20University%20in%20Pozna%C5%84">Poznań University</a>, Rejewski attended a secret cryptology course conducted by the <a href="Polish%20General%20Staff">Polish General Staff</a>'s <a href="Biuro%20Szyfr%C3%B3w">Cipher Bureau</a> ("Biuro Szyfrów"), which he joined in September 1932. The Bureau had had no success in reading Enigma-enciphered messages and set Rejewski to work on the problem in late 1932; he deduced the machine's secret internal wiring after only a few weeks. Rejewski and his two colleagues then developed successive techniques for the regular decryption of Enigma messages. His contributions included the <a href="card%20catalog%20%28cryptology%29">cryptologic card catalog</a>, derived using the <a href="cyclometer">cyclometer</a> that he had invented, and the <a href="bomba%20%28cryptography%29">cryptologic bomb</a>.

Five weeks before the <a href="Invasion%20of%20Poland%20%281939%29">German invasion of Poland in 1939</a>, Rejewski and colleagues presented their achievements to French and British intelligence representatives summoned to <a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>. Shortly after the outbreak of war, the Polish cryptologists were evacuated to France, where they continued breaking Enigma-enciphered messages. They and their support staff were again compelled to evacuate after the <a href="fall%20of%20France">fall of France</a> in June 1940, and they resumed work undercover a few months later in <a href="Vichy%20France">Vichy France</a>. After the French "Free Zone" was occupied by Germany in November 1942, Rejewski and Zygalski fled via Spain, Portugal, and Gibraltar to Britain. There they enlisted in the <a href="Polish%20Armed%20Forces">Polish Armed Forces</a> and were put to work solving low-grade German <a href="cipher">cipher</a>s.

After the war, Rejewski reunited with his family in Poland and worked as an accountant. For two decades, he remained silent about his prewar and wartime cryptologic work to avoid adverse attention from the country's Soviet-dominated government; he broke his silence in 1967 when he provided to the Polish Military Historical Institute his memoirs of his work in the Cipher Bureau. He died at age 74 of a heart attack and was interred with military honors at Warsaw's <a href="Pow%C4%85zki%20Military%20Cemetery">Powązki Military Cemetery</a>.

Marian Rejewski was born 16 August 1905 in Bromberg in the <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>n <a href="Province%20of%20Posen">Province of Posen</a> (now <a href="Bydgoszcz">Bydgoszcz</a>, Poland) to Józef and Matylda, "née" Thoms. After completing secondary school, he studied mathematics at <a href="Adam%20Mickiewicz%20University%20in%20Pozna%C5%84">Poznań University</a>'s Mathematics Institute, housed in <a href="Imperial%20Castle%20in%20Pozna%C5%84">Poznań Castle</a>.

In 1929, shortly before graduating from university, Rejewski began attending a secret cryptology course which opened on 15 January, organized for select German-speaking mathematics students by the Polish General Staff's <a href="Biuro%20Szyfr%C3%B3w">Cipher Bureau</a> with the help of the Mathematics Institute's Professor <a href="Zdzis%C5%82aw%20Krygowski">Zdzisław Krygowski</a>. The course was conducted off-campus at a military facility and, as Rejewski would discover in France in 1939, "was entirely and literally based" on French Colonel Marcel Givierge's 1925 book, "Cours de cryptographie" (Cryptography Course). Rejewski and fellow students <a href="Henryk%20Zygalski">Henryk Zygalski</a> and <a href="Jerzy%20R%C3%B3%C5%BCycki">Jerzy Różycki</a> were among the few who could keep up with the course while balancing the demands of their normal studies.

On 1 March 1929 Rejewski graduated with a Master of Philosophy degree in mathematics. A few weeks after graduating, and without having completed the Cipher Bureau's cryptology course, he began the first year of a two-year <a href="actuary">actuarial statistics</a> course at <a href="G%C3%B6ttingen">Göttingen</a>, Germany. He did not complete the statistics course, because while home for the summer of 1930, he accepted an offer, from Professor Krygowski, of a mathematics teaching assistantship at Poznań University. He also began working part-time for the Cipher Bureau, which by then had set up an outpost at Poznań to decrypt intercepted German radio messages. Rejewski worked some twelve hours a week near the Mathematics Institute in an underground vault referred to puckishly as the "Black Chamber".

The Poznań branch of the Cipher Bureau was disbanded in the summer of 1932. In Warsaw, on 1 September 1932, Rejewski, Zygalski, and Różycki joined the Cipher Bureau as civilian employees working at the General Staff building (the <a href="Saxon%20Palace">Saxon Palace</a>). Their first assignment was to solve a four-letter <a href="code%20%28cryptography%29">code</a> used by the "" (German Navy). Progress was initially slow, but sped up after a test exchange—consisting of a six-group signal, followed by a four-group response—was intercepted. The cryptologists guessed correctly that the first signal was the question, "When was <a href="Frederick%20the%20Great">Frederick the Great</a> born?" followed by the response, "1712."

On 20 June 1934 Rejewski married Irena Maria Lewandowska, daughter of a prosperous dentist. The couple eventually had two children: a son, Andrzej (Andrew), born in 1936; and a daughter, Janina (Joan), born in 1939. Janina would later become a mathematician like her father.

The Enigma machine was an <a href="electromechanical">electromechanical</a> device, equipped with a 26-letter keyboard and 26 lamps, corresponding to the letters of the alphabet. Inside was a set of wired drums (<a href="Enigma%20rotor%20details">rotors</a> and a <a href="reflector%20%28cipher%20machine%29">reflector</a>) that scrambled the input. The machine used a <a href="plugboard">plugboard</a> to swap pairs of letters, and the encipherment varied from one key press to the next. For two operators to communicate, both Enigma machines had to be set up in the same way. The large number of possibilities for setting the rotors and the plugboard combined to form an astronomical number of configurations, and the settings were changed daily, so the machine code had to be "broken" anew each day.

Before 1932, the Cipher Bureau had succeeded in solving an earlier Enigma machine that functioned without a plugboard, but had been unsuccessful with the <a href="Enigma%20I">Enigma I</a>, a new standard German cipher machine that was coming into widespread use. In late October or early November 1932, the head of the Cipher Bureau's German section, Captain <a href="Maksymilian%20Ci%C4%99%C5%BCki">Maksymilian Ciężki</a>, tasked Rejewski to work alone on the <a href="Enigma%20machine">German Enigma I machine</a> for a couple of hours per day; Rejewski was not to tell his colleagues what he was doing.

To decrypt Enigma messages, three pieces of information were needed: (1) a general understanding of how Enigma functioned; (2) the wiring of the rotors; and (3) the daily settings (the sequence and orientations of the rotors, and the plug connections on the plugboard). Rejewski had only the first at his disposal, based on information already acquired by the Cipher Bureau.
First Rejewski tackled the problem of discovering the wiring of the rotors. To do this, according to historian <a href="David%20Kahn%20%28writer%29">David Kahn</a>, he pioneered the use of <a href="pure%20mathematics">pure mathematics</a> in <a href="cryptanalysis">cryptanalysis</a>. Previous methods had largely exploited <a href="linguistics">linguistic pattern</a>s and the statistics of <a href="natural%20language">natural-language</a> texts—<a href="frequency%20analysis%20%28cryptanalysis%29">letter-frequency analysis</a>. Rejewski applied techniques from <a href="group%20theory">group theory</a>—theorems about <a href="permutation">permutation</a>s—in his attack on Enigma. These mathematical techniques, combined with material supplied by <a href="Gustave%20Bertrand">Gustave Bertrand</a>, chief of French radio intelligence, enabled him to reconstruct the internal wirings of the machine's rotors and nonrotating reflector. "The solution", writes Kahn, "was Rejewski's own stunning achievement, one that elevates him to the pantheon of the greatest cryptanalysts of all time." Rejewski used a <a href="Symmetric%20group%23Conjugacy%20classes">mathematical theorem</a>—that two permutations are <a href="Conjugacy%20class">conjugate</a> if and only if they have the same cycle structure—that mathematics professor and "<a href="Cryptologia">Cryptologia</a>" co-editor Cipher A. Deavours describes as "the theorem that won World War II".

Before receiving the French intelligence material, Rejewski had made a careful study of Enigma messages, particularly of the first six letters of messages intercepted on a single day. For security, each message was encrypted using different starting positions of the rotors, as selected by the operator. This message setting was three letters long. To convey it to the receiving operator, the sending operator began the message by sending the message setting in a disguised form — a six-letter <a href="Enigma%20machine%23Indicator">indicator</a>. The indicator was formed using the Enigma with its rotors set to a common global setting for that day, termed the "ground setting", which was shared by all operators. The particular way that the indicator was constructed introduced a weakness into the cipher.

For example, suppose the operator chose the message setting KYG for a message. The operator would first set the Enigma's rotors to the ground setting, which might be GBL on that particular day, and then encrypt the message setting on the Enigma "twice"; that is, the operator would enter KYGKYG (which might come out to something like QZKBLX). The operator would then reposition the rotors at KYG, and encrypt the actual message. A receiving operator could reverse the process to recover first the message setting, then the message itself. The repetition of the message setting was apparently meant as an error check to detect garbles, but it had the unforeseen effect of greatly weakening the cipher. Due to the indicator's repetition of the message setting, Rejewski knew that, in the <a href="plaintext">plaintext</a> of the indicator, the first and fourth letters were the same, the second and fifth were the same, and the third and sixth were the same. These relations could be exploited to break into the cipher.

Rejewski studied these related pairs of letters. For example, if there were four messages that had the following indicators on the same day: BJGTDN, LIFBAB, ETULZR, TFREII, then by looking at the first and fourth letters of each set, he knew that certain pairs of letters were related. B was related to T, L was related to B, E was related to L, and T was related to E: (B,T), (L,B), (E,L), and (T,E). If he had enough different messages to work with, he could build entire sequences of relationships: the letter B was related to T, which was related to E, which was related to L, which was related to B (see diagram). This was a "cycle of 4", since it took four jumps until it got back to the start letter. Another cycle on the same day might be Aformula_1Fformula_1Wformula_1A, or a "cycle of 3". If there were enough messages on a given day, all the letters of the alphabet might be covered by a number of different cycles of various sizes. The cycles would be consistent for one day, and then would change to a different set of cycles the next day. Similar analysis could be done on the 2nd and 5th letters, and the 3rd and 6th, identifying the cycles in each case and the number of steps in each cycle.

Using the data thus gained, combined with Enigma operators' tendency to choose predictable letter combinations as indicators (such as girlfriends' initials or a pattern of keys that they saw on the Enigma keyboard <these became known to the allies as "Cillies" ("Sillies" misspelled)>), Rejewski was able to deduce six permutations corresponding to the encipherment at six consecutive positions of the Enigma machine. These permutations could be described by six equations with various unknowns, representing the wiring within the entry drum, rotors, reflector, and plugboard.

At this point, Rejewski ran into difficulties due to the large number of unknowns in the set of equations that he had developed. He would later comment in 1980 that it was still not known whether such a set of six equations was soluble without further data. But he was assisted by cryptographic documents that Section D of French <a href="military%20intelligence">military intelligence</a> (the "<a href="Deuxi%C3%A8me%20Bureau">Deuxième Bureau</a>"), under future General <a href="Gustave%20Bertrand">Gustave Bertrand</a>, had obtained and passed on to the Polish Cipher Bureau. The documents, procured from a spy in the German Cryptographic Service, <a href="Hans-Thilo%20Schmidt">Hans-Thilo Schmidt</a>, included the Enigma settings for the months of September and October 1932. About 9 or 10 December 1932, the documents were given to Rejewski. They enabled him to reduce the number of unknowns and solve the wirings of the rotors and reflector.

There was another obstacle to overcome, however. The military Enigma had been modified from the commercial Enigma, of which Rejewski had had an actual example to study. In the commercial machine, the keys were connected to the entry drum in German keyboard order ("<a href="QWERTZU">QWERTZU</a>..."). However, in the military Enigma, the connections had instead been wired in alphabetical order: "ABCDEF..." This new wiring sequence foiled British cryptologists working on Enigma, who dismissed the "ABCDEF..." wiring as too obvious. Rejewski, perhaps guided by an intuition about a German fondness for order, simply guessed that the wiring was the normal alphabetic ordering. He later recalled that, after he had made this assumption, "from my pencil, as by magic, began to issue numbers designating the connections in rotor "N". Thus the connections in one rotor, the right-hand rotor, were finally known."

The settings provided by French Intelligence covered two months that straddled a changeover period for the rotor ordering. A different rotor happened to be in the right-hand position for the second month, and so the wirings of two rotors could be recovered by the same method. Rejewski later recalled: "Finding the [wiring] in the third [rotor], and especially... in the [reflector], now presented no great difficulties. Likewise there were no difficulties with determining the correct torsion of the [rotors'] side walls with respect to each other, or the moments when the left and middle drums turned." By year's end 1932, the wirings of all three rotors and the reflector had been recovered. A sample message in an Enigma instruction manual, providing a <a href="plaintext">plaintext</a> and its corresponding <a href="ciphertext">ciphertext</a> produced using a stated daily key and message key, helped clarify some remaining details.

There has been speculation as to whether the rotor wirings could have been solved without the documents supplied by French Intelligence. Rejewski recalled in 1980 that another way had been found that could have been used to solve the wirings, but that the method was "imperfect and tedious" and relied on chance. In 2005, mathematician John Lawrence claimed that it would have taken four years for this method to have had a reasonable likelihood of success. Rejewski had earlier written that "the conclusion is that the intelligence material furnished to us should be regarded as having been decisive to solution of the machine."

After Rejewski had determined the wiring in the remaining rotors, he was joined in early 1933 by Różycki and Zygalski in devising methods and equipment to break Enigma ciphers routinely. Rejewski later recalled:
Now we had the machine, but we didn't have the <a href="key%20%28cryptography%29">key</a>s and we couldn't very well require Bertrand to keep on supplying us with the keys every month ... The situation had reversed itself: before, we'd had the keys but we hadn't had the machine — we solved the machine; now we had the machine but we didn't have the keys. We had to work out methods to find the daily keys.

A number of methods and devices had to be invented in response to continual improvements in German operating procedure and to the Enigma machine itself. The earliest method for reconstructing daily keys was the "<a href="grill%20%28cryptology%29">grill</a>", based on the fact that the plugboard's connections exchanged only six pairs of letters, leaving fourteen letters unchanged. Next was Różycki's "<a href="clock%20%28cryptology%29">clock</a>" method, which sometimes made it possible to determine which rotor was at the right-hand side of the Enigma machine on a given day.

After 1 October 1936, German procedure changed, and the number of plugboard connections became variable, ranging between five and eight. As a result, the grill method became considerably less effective. However, a method using a <a href="card%20catalog%20%28cryptology%29">card catalog</a> had been devised around 1934 or 1935, and was independent of the number of plug connections. The catalog was constructed using Rejewski's "<a href="cyclometer">cyclometer</a>", a special-purpose device for creating a catalog of permutations. Once the catalog was complete, the permutation could be looked up in the catalog, yielding the Enigma rotor settings for that day.

The cyclometer comprised two sets of Enigma rotors, and was used to determine the length and number of cycles of the permutations that could be generated by the Enigma machine. Even with the cyclometer, preparing the catalog was a long and difficult task. Each position of the Enigma machine (there were 17,576 positions) had to be examined for each possible sequence of rotors (there were 6 possible sequences); therefore, the catalog comprised 105,456 entries. Preparation of the catalog took over a year, but when it was ready about 1935, it made obtaining daily keys a matter of 12–20 minutes. However, on 1 or 2 November 1937, the Germans replaced the <a href="reflector%20%28cipher%20machine%29">reflector</a> in their Enigma machines, which meant that the entire catalog had to be recalculated from scratch. Nonetheless, by January 1938 the Cipher Bureau's German section was reading a remarkable 75% of Enigma intercepts, and according to Rejewski, with a minimal increase in personnel this could have been increased to 90%.

In 1937 Rejewski, along with the German section of the Cipher Bureau, transferred to a secret facility near <a href="Pyry%20%28neighborhood%29">Pyry</a> in the <a href="Kabaty%20Woods">Kabaty Woods</a> south of Warsaw. On 15 September 1938, the Germans introduced new rules for enciphering message keys (a new "indicator procedure"), making the Poles' earlier techniques obsolete. The Polish cryptanalysts rapidly responded with new techniques. One was Rejewski's "", an electrically powered aggregate of six Enigmas, which solved the daily keys within about two hours. Six "bomba"s were built and were ready for use by mid-November 1938. The "bomba" exploited the fact that the plugboard connections did not affect all the letters; therefore, when another change to German operating procedure occurred on 1 January 1939, increasing the number of plugboard connections, the usefulness of the "bomba"s was greatly reduced. The British <a href="bombe">bombe</a>, the main tool that would be used to break Enigma messages during World War II, would be named after, and likely inspired by, the Polish "bomba", though the cryptologic methods embodied in the two machines were different.

Around the same time as Rejewski's "bomba", a manual method was invented by Henryk Zygalski, that of "<a href="perforated%20sheets">perforated sheets</a>" ("Zygalski sheets"), which was independent of the number of plugboard connections. Rejewski describes the construction of the Zygalski mechanism and its manipulation:

However, application of both the "bomba" and Zygalski sheets was complicated by yet another change to the Enigma machine on 15 December 1938. The Germans had supplied Enigma operators with an additional two rotors to supplement the original three, and this increased the complexity of decryption tenfold. Building ten times as many "bomba"s (60 would now be needed) was beyond the Cipher Bureau's ability—that many "bomba"s would have cost fifteen times its entire annual equipment budget.

Two and a half weeks later, effective 1 January 1939, the Germans increased the number of plug connections to 7–10, which, writes Rejewski, "to a great degree, decreased the usefulness of the bombs." Zygalski's perforated ("Zygalski") sheets, writes Rejewski, "like the card-catalog method, was independent of the number of plug connections. But the manufacture of these sheets, [...] in our [...] circumstances, was very time-consuming, so that by 15 December 1938, only one-third of the whole job had been done. [T]he Germans' [introduction of rotors] IV and V [...] increased the labor of making the sheets tenfold [since 60, or ten times as many, sets of sheets were now needed], considerably exceeding our [...] capacities."

As it became clear that war was imminent and that Polish financial resources were insufficient to keep pace with the evolution of Enigma encryption (e.g., due to the prohibitive expense of an additional 54 "bomba"s and due to the Poles' difficulty in producing in timely fashion the full 60 series of 26 "<a href="Zygalski%20sheets">Zygalski sheets</a>"), the Polish General Staff and government decided to initiate their Western allies into the secrets of Enigma decryption. The Polish methods were revealed to French and <a href="British%20Intelligence">British</a> intelligence representatives in a meeting at <a href="Pyry%20%28neighborhood%29">Pyry</a>, south of Warsaw, on 25 July 1939. France was represented by Gustave Bertrand and Air Force cryptologist Captain <a href="Henri%20Braqueni%C3%A9">Henri Braquenié</a>; Britain, by <a href="Government%20Code%20and%20Cypher%20School">Government Code and Cypher School</a> chief <a href="Alastair%20Denniston">Alastair Denniston</a>, veteran cryptologist <a href="Alfred%20Dillwyn%20Knox">Alfred Dillwyn Knox</a>, and Commander Humphrey Sandwith, head of the section that had developed and controlled the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>'s intercept and direction-finding stations. The Polish hosts included Cipher Bureau chief <a href="Gwido%20Langer">Gwido Langer</a>, the Bureau's German-Section chief <a href="Maksymilian%20Ci%C4%99%C5%BCki">Maksymilian Ciężki</a>, the Bureau's General-Staff-Intelligence supervisor <a href="Stefan%20Mayer">Stefan Mayer</a>, and the three cryptologists Rejewski, Różycki and Zygalski.

The Poles' gift of Enigma decryption to their Western allies, five weeks before the outbreak of World War II, came not a moment too soon. Knowledge that the cipher was crackable was a morale boost to Allied cryptologists. The British were able to manufacture at least two complete sets of perforated sheets—they sent one to "<a href="PC%20Bruno">PC Bruno</a>", outside Paris, in mid-December 1939—and began reading Enigma within months of the outbreak of war.

Without the Polish assistance, British cryptologists would, at the very least, have been considerably delayed in reading Enigma. <a href="Hugh%20Sebag-Montefiore">Hugh Sebag-Montefiore</a> concludes that substantial breaks into German Army and Air Force Enigma ciphers by the British would have occurred only after November 1941 at the earliest, after an Enigma machine and key lists had been captured, and similarly into Naval Enigma only after late 1942.

Intelligence gained from solving high-level German ciphers—intelligence codenamed <a href="Ultra">Ultra</a> by the British and Americans—came chiefly from Enigma decrypts. While the exact contribution of Ultra intelligence to Allied victory is disputed, Kozaczuk and Straszak note that "it is widely believed that Ultra saved the world at least two years of war and possibly prevented <a href="Hitler">Hitler</a> from winning." The English historian Sir <a href="Harry%20Hinsley">Harry Hinsley</a>, who worked at Bletchley Park, similarly assessed it as having "shortened the war by not less than two years and probably by four years". The availability of Ultra was due to the earlier Polish breaking of Enigma; <a href="Gordon%20Welchman">Gordon Welchman</a>, head of Bletchley Park's <a href="Hut%206">Hut 6</a> (which solved German Army and Air Force Enigma ciphers), writes: "Hut 6 Ultra would never have gotten off the ground if we had not learned from the Poles, in the nick of time, the details both of the German military version of the commercial Enigma machine, and of the operating procedures that were in use."

On 5 September 1939 the Cipher Bureau began preparations to evacuate key personnel and equipment from Warsaw. Soon a special evacuation train, the Echelon F, transported them eastward, then south. By the time the Cipher Bureau was ordered to cross the border into allied Romania on 17 September, they had destroyed all sensitive documents and equipment and were down to a single very crowded truck. The vehicle was confiscated at the border by a Romanian officer, who separated the military from the civilian personnel. Taking advantage of the confusion, the three mathematicians ignored the Romanian's instructions. They anticipated that in an internment camp they might be identified by the Romanian security police, in which the German <a href="Abwehr">Abwehr</a> and <a href="Sicherheitsdienst">SD</a> had informers. The mathematicians went to the nearest railroad station, exchanged money, bought tickets, and boarded the first train headed south. After a dozen or so hours, they reached Bucharest, at the other end of Romania. There they went to the British embassy. Told by the British to "come back in a few days", they next tried the French embassy, introducing themselves as "friends of Bolek" (Bertrand's Polish code name) and asking to speak with a French military officer. A French Army colonel telephoned Paris and then issued instructions for the three Poles to be assisted in evacuating to Paris.

On 20 October 1939 the three Polish cryptologists resumed work on German ciphers at a joint French–Polish–Spanish radio-intelligence unit stationed at <a href="Gretz-Armainvilliers">Gretz-Armainvilliers</a>, forty kilometers northeast of Paris, and housed in the Château de Vignolles (code-named "PC Bruno").

As late as 3–7 December 1939, when Lt. Col. Langer and French Air Force Capt. <a href="Henri%20Braqueni%C3%A9">Henri Braquenié</a> visited <a href="London">London</a> and <a href="Bletchley%20Park">Bletchley Park</a>, the British asked that the Polish cryptologists be made available to them in Britain. Langer, however, took the position that they must remain where the Polish Army in exile was forming—on French soil.

On 17 January 1940 the Poles found the first Enigma key to be solved in France, one for 28 October 1939. The "PC Bruno" staff collaborated by <a href="teleprinter">teleprinter</a> with counterparts at Bletchley Park in England. For their mutual communications security, the Polish, French, and British cryptologic agencies used the Enigma machine itself. "Bruno" closed its Enigma-encrypted messages to Britain with an ironic ""<a href="Heil%20Hitler">Heil Hitler</a>!""

In the first months of 1940, <a href="Alan%20Turing">Alan Turing</a>—principal designer of the British cryptological <a href="Bombe">Bombe</a>, elaborated from the Polish "<a href="bomba%20%28cryptography%29">bomba</a>"—would visit "Bruno" to confer about Enigma decryption with the three Polish cryptologists.

On 24 June 1940, after Germany's victory in the <a href="Battle%20of%20France">Battle of France</a>, Gustave Bertrand flew "Bruno"'s international personnel—including fifteen Poles, and seven Spaniards who worked on Italian ciphers—in three planes to Algeria.

Some three months later, in September 1940, they returned to work covertly in unoccupied southern, <a href="Vichy%20France">Vichy France</a>. Rejewski's cover was as "Pierre Ranaud", a "<a href="lyc%C3%A9e">lycée</a>" professor from <a href="Nantes">Nantes</a>. A radio-intelligence station was set up at the Château des Fouzes, code-named "<a href="Cadix">Cadix</a>", near <a href="Uz%C3%A8s">Uzès</a>. "Cadix" began operations on 1 October. Rejewski and his colleagues solved German <a href="Telegraphy">telegraph</a> ciphers, and also the Swiss version of the Enigma machine (which had no plugboard). Rejewski may have had little or no involvement in working on German Enigma at "Cadix".

In early July 1941, Rejewski and Zygalski were asked to try solving messages enciphered on the secret Polish <a href="Lacida">Lacida</a> cipher machine, which was used for secure communications between "<a href="Cadix">Cadix</a>" and the <a href="Polish%20General%20Staff">Polish General Staff</a> in London. Lacida was a <a href="rotor%20machine">rotor machine</a> based on the same cryptographic principle as Enigma, yet had never been subjected to rigorous security analysis. The two cryptologists created consternation by breaking the first message within a couple of hours; further messages were solved in a similar way.

The youngest of the three Polish mathematicians who had worked together since 1929—<a href="Jerzy%20R%C3%B3%C5%BCycki">Jerzy Różycki</a>—died in the sinking of a French passenger ship on 9 January 1942, as he was returning to "Cadix" from a stint in Algeria. By summer 1942 work at "<a href="Cadix">Cadix</a>" was becoming dangerous, and plans for evacuation were drawn up. Vichy France was liable to be occupied by German troops, and "Cadix"'s radio transmissions were increasingly at risk of detection by the German "<a href="Funkabwehr">Funkabwehr</a>", a unit tasked with locating enemy radio transmitters. Indeed, on 6 November a pickup truck equipped with a circular antenna arrived at the gate of the Château des Fouzes where the cryptologists were operating. The visitors, however, did not enter, and merely investigated nearby farms, badly frightening their occupants. Nonetheless, at Bertrand's suggestion French intelligence ordered the evacuation of "Cadix". The order was carried out on 9 November, the day after the Allied "<a href="Operation%20Torch">Operation Torch</a>" landings in North Africa. Three days later, on 12 November, the Germans occupied the chateau.

The Poles were split into groups of two and three. On 11 November 1942 Rejewski and Zygalski were sent to <a href="Nice">Nice</a>, in the Italian-occupied zone. After coming under suspicion there, they had to flee again, moving or hiding constantly. Their trek took them to <a href="Cannes">Cannes</a>, <a href="Antibes">Antibes</a>, back to Nice, then on to <a href="Marseilles">Marseilles</a>, <a href="Toulouse">Toulouse</a>, <a href="Narbonne">Narbonne</a>, <a href="Perpignan">Perpignan</a>, and <a href="Ax-les-Thermes">Ax-les-Thermes</a>, near the Spanish border. On 29 January 1943, accompanied by a local guide, Rejewski, and Zygalski, bound for Spain, began a climb over the <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a>, avoiding German and Vichy patrols. Near midnight, close to the Spanish border, the guide pulled out a pistol and demanded that they hand over their remaining money.

After being robbed, Rejewski and Zygalski succeeded in reaching the Spanish side of the border, only to be arrested within hours by security police. They were sent first to a prison in <a href="La%20Seu%20d%27Urgell">La Seu d'Urgell</a>, then on 24 March transferred to a prison at <a href="Lerida">Lerida</a>. On 4 May 1943, after having spent over three months in Spanish prisons, on intervention by the <a href="Polish%20Red%20Cross">Polish Red Cross</a> the pair were released and sent to <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a>. Leaving there on 21 July, they made it to Portugal; from there, aboard HMS "Scottish", to Gibraltar; and then by air to <a href="RAF%20Hendon">RAF Hendon</a> in north London, arriving on 3 August 1943.

Rejewski and Zygalski were inducted as <a href="private%20%28rank%29">private</a>s into the <a href="Polish%20Armed%20Forces">Polish Armed Forces</a> on 16 August 1943 and were posted to a Polish Army facility in <a href="Boxmoor">Boxmoor</a>, cracking German <a href="Schutzstaffel">SS</a> and <a href="Sicherheitsdienst">SD</a> hand ciphers. The ciphers were usually based on the "Doppelkassettenverfahren" ("double <a href="Playfair%20cipher">Playfair</a>") system, which the two cryptologists had already worked on in France. British cryptologist <a href="Alan%20Stripp">Alan Stripp</a> suggests that "Setting them to work on the "Doppelkassetten" system was like using racehorses to pull wagons." On 10 October 1943, Rejewski and Zygalski were commissioned second lieutenants; on 1 January 1945 Rejewski, and presumably also Zygalski, were promoted to lieutenant. When Gustave Bertrand fled to England in June 1944, he and his wife were provided with a house in Boxmoor, a short walk from the Polish radio station and cryptology office, where it seems likely that his collaboration with Rejewski and Zygalski continued.

Enigma decryption, however, had become an exclusively British and American domain; the Polish mathematicians who had laid the foundations for Allied Enigma decryption were now excluded from making further contributions in this area. By that time, at <a href="Bletchley%20Park">Bletchley Park</a>, "very few even knew about the Polish contribution" because of the strict secrecy and the "<a href="need-to-know">need-to-know</a>" principle.

After the Germans suppressed the 1944 <a href="Warsaw%20Uprising%20%281944%29">Warsaw Uprising</a>, they sent Rejewski's wife and children west, along with other Warsaw survivors; the family eventually found refuge with her parents in Bydgoszcz. Rejewski was discharged from the Polish Army in Britain on 15 November 1946. Six days later, he returned to Poland to be reunited with his wife and family. On his return, he was urged by his old Poznań University professor, <a href="Zdzis%C5%82aw%20Krygowski">Zdzisław Krygowski</a>, to take a university mathematics post at Poznań or <a href="Szczecin">Szczecin</a>, in western Poland. Rejewski could have looked forward to rapid advancement because of personnel shortages as a result of the war. However, he was still recovering from <a href="rheumatism">rheumatism</a>, which he had contracted in the dank Spanish prisons. Soon after his return to Poland, in the summer of 1947, his 11-year-old son Andrzej died of <a href="poliomyelitis">polio</a> after only five days' illness. After his son's death, Rejewski did not want to part, even briefly, with his wife and daughter, so they lived in Bydgoszcz with his in-laws. Rejewski took a position in Bydgoszcz as director of the sales department at a cable-manufacturing company, "Kabel Polski" (Polish Cable).
Between 1949 and 1958 Rejewski was repeatedly investigated by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Public%20Security%20%28Poland%29">Polish Office of Public Security</a>, who suspected he was a former member of the <a href="Polish%20Armed%20Forces%20in%20the%20West">Polish Armed Forces in the West</a>. He retired in 1967, and moved with his family back to Warsaw in 1969, to an apartment he had acquired 30 years earlier with financial help from his father-in-law.

Rejewski had written a "Report of Cryptologic Work on the German Enigma Machine Cipher" in 1942. Before his 1967 retirement, he began writing his "Memoirs of My Work in the Cipher Bureau of Section II of the [Polish] General Staff", which were purchased by the Polish Military Historical Institute, in Warsaw. Rejewski had often wondered what use <a href="Alan%20Turing">Alan Turing</a> (who in early 1940 had visited the Polish cryptologists at "<a href="PC%20Bruno">PC Bruno</a>" outside Paris) and the British at Bletchley Park had ultimately made of the Polish discoveries and inventions. For nearly three decades after the war, little was publicly known due to a ban imposed in 1945 by British Prime Minister <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>. In a 1967 book <a href="W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20Kozaczuk">Władysław Kozaczuk</a>, associated with the Military Historical Institute, disclosed Poland's breaking of the German Enigma ciphers.

Until 1974, the scant information published concerning Enigma decryption attracted little attention. <a href="Ladislas%20Farago">Ladislas Farago</a>'s 1971 best-seller "The Game of the Foxes" presented a garbled account of Ultra's origins: "Commander <a href="Alastair%20Denniston">Denniston</a> went clandestinely to a secluded Polish castle ["sic"] on the eve of the war [to pick up an Enigma, 'the Wehrmacht's top system' during World War II]. <a href="Alfred%20Dillwyn%20Knox">Dilly Knox</a> later solved its keying ["sic"]..." Still, this was marginally closer to the truth than many British and American best-seller accounts that would follow after 1974. Their authors were at a disadvantage: they did not know that the founder of Enigma decryption, Rejewski, was still alive and alert, and that it was reckless to fabricate stories out of whole cloth.
With <a href="Gustave%20Bertrand">Gustave Bertrand</a>'s 1973 publication of his "Enigma", substantial information about the origins of Ultra began to seep out; and with <a href="F.%20W.%20Winterbotham">F. W. Winterbotham</a>'s 1974 best-seller, "<a href="F.%20W.%20Winterbotham%23The%20Ultra%20Secret">The Ultra Secret</a>", the dam began to burst. Still, many aspiring authors were not averse to filling gaps in their information with whole-cloth fabrications. Rejewski fought a gallant (if, into the 21st century, not entirely successful) fight to get the truth before the public. He published a number of papers on his cryptologic work and contributed generously to articles, books, and television programs. He was interviewed by scholars, journalists, and television crews from Poland, East Germany, the United States, Britain, Sweden, Belgium, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Brazil.

Rejewski maintained a lively correspondence with his wartime French host, General <a href="Gustave%20Bertrand">Gustave Bertrand</a>, and at the General's bidding he began translating Bertrand's "Enigma" into Polish. In 1976, at the request of the <a href="J%C3%B3zef%20Pi%C5%82sudski%20Institute%20of%20America">Józef Piłsudski Institute of America</a>, Rejewski broke <a href="encipher">encipher</a>ed correspondence of <a href="J%C3%B3zef%20Pi%C5%82sudski">Józef Piłsudski</a> and his fellow <a href="Polish%20Socialist%20Party">Polish Socialist</a> conspirators from 1904. On 12 August 1978 he received from a grateful Polish people the Officer's Cross of the Order of "<a href="Polonia%20Restituta">Polonia Restituta</a>".

Rejewski, who had been suffering from <a href="heart%20disease">heart disease</a>, died of a heart attack on 13 February 1980, aged 74, after returning home from a shopping trip. He was buried with military honors at <a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>'s <a href="Pow%C4%85zki%20Military%20Cemetery">Powązki Military Cemetery</a>.

On 21 July 2000, Poland's President <a href="Aleksander%20Kwa%C5%9Bniewski">Aleksander Kwaśniewski</a> posthumously awarded Poland's second-highest civilian decoration, the <a href="Order%20of%20Polonia%20Restituta%23Classes">Grand Cross of the Order of "Polonia Restituta"</a>, to Marian Rejewski and Henryk Zygalski. In July 2005 Rejewski's daughter, Janina Sylwestrzak, received on his behalf the <a href="War%20Medal%201939%E2%80%931945">War Medal 1939–1945</a> from the <a href="British%20Chief%20of%20the%20Defence%20Staff">British Chief of the Defence Staff</a>. On 1 August 2012 Marian Rejewski posthumously received the <a href="Thomas%20Knowlton%23Knowlton%20Award">Knowlton Award</a> of the U.S. <a href="Military%20Intelligence%20Corps%20Association">Military Intelligence Corps Association</a>; his daughter Janina accepted the award at his home town, Bydgoszcz, on 4 September 2012. Rejewski had been nominated for the Award by <a href="NATO">NATO</a> Allied Command Counterintelligence.

In 2009, the <a href="Polish%20Post">Polish Post</a> issued a series of four commemorative stamps, one of which pictured Rejewski and fellow mathematician-cryptologists <a href="Jerzy%20R%C3%B3%C5%BCycki">Jerzy Różycki</a> and <a href="Henryk%20Zygalski">Henryk Zygalski</a>. 

On 5 August 2014 the <a href="Institute%20of%20Electrical%20and%20Electronics%20Engineers">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers</a> (IEEE) honored Rejewski, Różycki, and Zygalski with its prestigious Milestone Award, which recognizes achievements that have changed the world.

A three-sided bronze monument was dedicated in 2007 in front of the <a href="Imperial%20Castle%2C%20Pozna%C5%84">Imperial Castle</a> in <a href="Pozna%C5%84">Poznań</a>. Each side bears the name of one of the three Polish mathematicians who broke the Enigma cipher.

Rejewski and colleagues were the heroes of "Sekret Enigmy" ("The Enigma Secret"), a <a href="Thriller%20%28genre%29">thriller movie</a> about the Poles' solution of the German Enigma cipher. Late 1980 also saw a Polish TV series with a similar theme, "Tajemnice Enigmy" ("The Secrets of Enigma").

Banksia integrifolia

<a href="Banksia">Banksia</a> integrifolia, commonly known as coast banksia, is a <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="tree">tree</a> that grows along the east coast of <a href="Australia">Australia</a>. One of the most widely distributed "<a href="Banksia">Banksia</a>" species, it occurs between <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> and <a href="Central%20Queensland">Central Queensland</a> in a broad range of <a href="habitat%20%28ecology%29">habitats</a>, from coastal <a href="dune">dune</a>s to <a href="mountain">mountain</a>s. It is highly variable in form, but is most often encountered as a tree up to 25 metres (82 ft) in height. Its <a href="leaf">leaves</a> have dark green upper surfaces and white undersides, a contrast that can be striking on windy days.

It is one of the four original "Banksia" species collected by <a href="Joseph%20Banks">Sir Joseph Banks</a> in 1770, and one of four species published in 1782 as part of <a href="Carolus%20Linnaeus%20the%20Younger">Carolus Linnaeus the Younger</a>'s original description of the genus. It has had a complicated <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> history, with numerous species and varieties ascribed to it, only to be rejected or promoted to separate species. The taxonomy is now largely settled, with three <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> recognised: <a href="Banksia%20integrifolia%20subsp.%20integrifolia">"B. integrifolia" subsp. "integrifolia"</a>, <a href="Banksia%20integrifolia%20subsp.%20compar">"B. integrifolia" subsp. "compar"</a> and <a href="Banksia%20integrifolia%20subsp.%20monticola">"B. integrifolia" subsp. "monticola"</a>.

A hardy and versatile <a href="garden">garden</a> plant, "B. integrifolia" is widely planted in Australian gardens. It is a popular choice for parks and streetscapes, and has been used for bush <a href="revegetation">revegetation</a> and stabilisation of dunes. Its hardiness has prompted research into its suitability for use as a <a href="rootstock">rootstock</a> in the <a href="floriculture">cut flower trade</a>, but has also caused concerns about its potential to become a <a href="weed">weed</a> outside its natural habitat.

Now widely known as coast banksia or coastal banksia, "B. integrifolia" was previously known by a range of common names. The "Checklist of Australian Trees" lists four other common names: honeysuckle, white banksia, white bottlebrush and white honeysuckle; and some older sources refer to it as honeysuckle oak.

It was known to <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Indigenous Australians</a> before its discovery and naming by <a href="Europe">Europe</a>ans; for example, the <a href="Gunai%20people">Gunai</a> people of <a href="Gippsland">Gippsland</a> called it birrna. Because of its wide range it would have a name in a number of other <a href="Australian%20Aboriginal%20languages">indigenous languages</a>, but these are now lost. In 2001, a search of historical archives for recorded indigenous names of Victorian flora and fauna failed to find a single name for the species.

"B. integrifolia" is a highly variable species. It is most often encountered as a tree up to 25 metres (80 ft) in height, but in sheltered locations it can reach 35 metres (110 ft). In more exposed areas it may grow as a small, gnarled tree, reaching to no more than about 5 metres (15 ft), and in highly exposed positions, such as on exposed coastal headlands, it may even be reduced to a small <a href="shrub">shrub</a>.

It usually has a single stout trunk, which is often twisted and gnarled, with the rough grey bark characteristic of "Banksia". The leaves are dark green with a white underside, and occur in <a href="Whorl%20%28botany%29">whorls</a> of three to five. Adult leaves have entire margins; George specifies their dimensions as 4 to 20 centimetres (2–8 in) long and 6 to 35 millimetres (0.2–1.4 in) wide, but "<a href="The%20Banksia%20Atlas">The Banksia Atlas</a>" warns that "Atlas contributors found great variability in these measurements with specimens often falling outside the varietal limits specified by George (1981) or being intermediate between two varieties." Juvenile leaves have dentate margins with a few short teeth, and are generally larger than adult leaves.

<a href="Flower">Flower</a>s occur in "Banksia"'s characteristic "flower spike", an <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a> made up of several hundred flowers densely packed in a <a href="helix">spiral</a> around a woody axis. This is roughly cylindrical, 10 to 12 centimetres (4–5 in) high and five centimetres (2 in) wide. Flowers are usually pale yellow to yellow, but may be greenish or pinkish in bud. Each individual flower consists of a tubular <a href="perianth">perianth</a> made up of four united <a href="tepal">tepal</a>s, and one long wiry <a href="carpel">style</a>. Characteristic of the taxonomic section in which it is placed, the styles are straight rather than hooked. The style ends are initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but break free at <a href="anthesis">anthesis</a>. This process starts with the flowers at the bottom of the inflorescence, sweeping up the spike at an unusually high rate of between 96 and 390 flowers per 24 hours.

The flower spikes are not as prominent as in some other "Banksia" species, as they arise from two- to three-year-old nodes nested within the foliage. After flowering, old flower parts wither and fall away over a period of several months, revealing the "cone", a woody axis embedded with many small <a href="follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a>. The follicles are initially greenish and downy, but gradually fade to dark grey. Each follicle contains one or sometimes two <a href="seed">seed</a>s, separated by a thin wooden <a href="Seed%20separator">separator</a>. The seed itself is black, 6 to 10 millimetres (0.2–0.4 in) long with a feathery black 'wing' 10 to 20 millimetres (0.4–0.8 in) long.

"B. integrifolia" was first collected at <a href="Botany%20Bay">Botany Bay</a> on 29 April 1770, by <a href="Joseph%20Banks">Sir Joseph Banks</a> and <a href="Daniel%20Solander">Dr Daniel Solander</a>, naturalists on the "<a href="HM%20Bark%20Endeavour">Endeavour</a>" during Lieutenant (later Captain) <a href="James%20Cook">James Cook</a>'s <a href="James%20Cook%23First%20voyage%20%281768%E2%80%9371%29">first voyage</a> to the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>. However, the species was not published until April 1782, when <a href="Carolus%20Linnaeus%20the%20Younger">Carolus Linnaeus the Younger</a> described the first four "Banksia" species in his "<a href="Supplementum%20Plantarum">Supplementum Plantarum</a>". Linnaeus distinguished the species by their leaf shapes, and named them accordingly. Thus the species with <a href="Leaf%23Margins%20%28edge%29">entire leaf margins</a> was given the specific name "integrifolia", from the Latin "integer", meaning "entire", and "folium", meaning "leaf". The <a href="Binomial%20nomenclature%23Authorship%20in%20scientific%20names">full name</a> for the species is therefore "Banksia integrifolia" L.f.

Then followed around 200 years of confusion over the taxonomic limits of the species, caused by the species' great variability, similarities with closely related species, and early attempts to classify the species based on dried specimen material alone. A stable "Banksia" taxonomy did not begin to emerge until 1981 with the publication of <a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a>'s landmark monograph "<a href="The%20genus%20Banksia%20L.f.%20%28Proteaceae%29">The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)</a>". Over the next 18 years, George's arrangement was gradually refined in the light of new research and the discovery of new material, and there were several changes to "B. integrifolia"s infraspecific taxa. These changes culminated in George's 1999 arrangement, which had broad acceptance until 2005, when <a href="Austin%20Mast">Austin Mast</a>, Eric Jones and Shawn Havery published a <a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a> that did not accord with George's arrangement. A new taxonomic arrangement was not published at the time, but early in 2007 Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring "<a href="Dryandra">Dryandra</a>" to "Banksia", and publishing <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Spathulatae">"B." subg. "Spathulatae"</a> for the species having spoon-shaped <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>s. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA <a href="sampling%20%28statistics%29">sampling</a> of "Dryandra" was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then "B. integrifolia" is placed in "B." subg. "Spathulatae"; indeed, it is the type species for the subgenus.

The current taxonomic arrangement of the genus "Banksia" is based on George's 1999 monograph for the "<a href="Flora%20of%20Australia%20%28series%29">Flora of Australia</a>" book series. In this arrangement, "B. integrifolia" is placed in <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">"Banksia" subg. "Banksia"</a>, because its inflorescences take the form of "Banksia"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s characteristic flower spikes; <a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Banksia">"Banksia" sect. "Banksia"</a> because of its straight <a href="carpel">styles</a>; and <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Salicinae">"Banksia" ser. "Salicinae"</a> because its inflorescences are cylindrical. Kevin Thiele additionally placed it in a subseries "Integrifoliae", but this was not supported by George.
"B. integrifolia"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s placement within "Banksia" may be summarised as follows:

Although some of the great variability of "B. integrifolia" can be attributed to environmental factors, much is <a href="genetics">genetic</a>: George writes that it "gives the impression that it is actively speciating to fill the many ecological niches through its range". Three subspecies are currently recognised: <a href="Banksia%20integrifolia%20subsp.%20integrifolia">"B. integrifolia" subsp. "integrifolia"</a>, <a href="Banksia%20integrifolia%20subsp.%20compar">"B. integrifolia" subsp. "compar"</a>, and <a href="Banksia%20integrifolia%20subsp.%20monticola">"B. integrifolia" subsp. "monticola"</a>.

Presumed natural <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybrids</a> have been reported between "B. integrifolia" and other members of <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Salicinae">"Banksia" ser. "Salicinae"</a>, although no <a href="hybrid%20name%20%28botany%29">hybrid names</a> have been formally published to date. Presumed hybrids are identified by their intermediate features; for example those with "<a href="Banksia%20paludosa">B. paludosa</a>" (swamp banksia), known from <a href="Jervis%20Bay%20Territory">Jervis Bay</a> and <a href="Green%20Cape">Green Cape</a> on the coast of southern New South Wales, have a smaller habit, longer, thinner flower spikes, and persistent old flowers on old "cones", which are otherwise bare on pure "B. integrifolia".

Presumed hybrids with "<a href="Banksia%20marginata">B. marginata</a>" (silver banksia) occur on <a href="Wilsons%20Promontory">Wilsons Promontory</a> in Victoria; these are found in localities where both species co-occur, and have features intermediate between the two. Another purported hybrid with "B. marginata", thought to be from <a href="Cape%20Paterson%2C%20Victoria">Cape Paterson</a> on Victoria's south coast, was first described by Alf Salkin and is commercially available in small quantities. It forms an attractive hardy low-growing plant to 1 metre.

"B. integrifolia" is widely distributed, in both <a href="geography%20of%20Australia">geographical</a> and <a href="ecology">ecological</a> terms. According to Alex George, "it spans a wider geographical and <a href="Climate%20of%20Australia">climatic</a> range than any other species." Thiele and <a href="Pauline%20Ladiges">Ladiges</a> make a similar claim: that its distribution "is a broader latitudinal, altitudinal and ecological amplitude than any other species, with the possible exception of "<a href="Banksia%20spinulosa">B. spinulosa</a>"."

It occurs along almost the entire eastern coast of Australia, from <a href="Geelong%2C%20Victoria">Geelong</a>, <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> to <a href="Proserpine%2C%20Queensland">Proserpine</a>, <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>. There was an isolated population on <a href="Long%20Island%20%28Tasmania%29">Long Island</a>, <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> in 1999, and an 1876 record allegedly from <a href="King%20Island%20%28Tasmania%29">King Island</a>, although there has been speculation that that specimen was actually collected in the <a href="Furneaux%20Group%20%28Tasmania%29">Furneaux Group</a>. The species no longer occurs at any of these Tasmania locations, and has been declared <a href="List%20of%20extinct%20flora%20of%20Australia%23Tasmania">extinct in Tasmania</a> under that state's "<a href="Threatened%20Species%20Protection%20Act%201995">Threatened Species Protection Act 1995</a>". The range of latitude is thus about 20 to 38°S.
For most of its distribution, "B. integrifolia" occurs only within about 50 kilometres (30 mi) of the coast, where it typically occurs on poor quality sandy soils derived from <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>. It grows near coastal cliffs and headlands, alongside river <a href="estuary">estuaries</a>, and even on stabilised sand dunes. The temperature range for this area is around 0–30 °C (30–85 °F), with almost no <a href="frost">frost</a>s. The species can occur in pure stands, but is usually associated with other species such as "<a href="Melaleuca%20quinquenervia">Melaleuca quinquenervia</a>" (broad-leaved paperbark).

Between <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> and <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, "B. integrifolia" is found up to 200 kilometres (125 mi) inland, with "B. integrifolia" subsp. "monticola" occurring in the Blue Mountains at altitudes up to 1500 metres (5000 ft). There it grows on better quality volcanic or rocky soils derived from <a href="granite">granite</a>s and <a href="basalt">basalt</a>s, and would experience up to 100 frosts per year. In this montane habitat, it occurs in association with "<a href="Eucalyptus">Eucalyptus</a>" species such as <a href="Eucalyptus%20viminalis">"E. viminalis"</a> (manna gum) and <a href="Eucalyptus%20pauciflora">"E. pauciflora"</a> (snow gum), and also <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a> species such as "<a href="Nothofagus%20moorei">Nothofagus moorei</a>" (Antarctic beech) and "<a href="Orites%20excelsa">Orites excelsa</a>" (prickly ash).

No other species of tree occurs closer to the coast at <a href="Cape%20Byron">Cape Byron</a>, making "B. integrifolia" the most easterly tree on the Australian mainland.

Like most other <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a>, "B. integrifolia" has <a href="proteoid%20root">proteoid root</a>s, roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter. These enhance <a href="solubility">solubilisation</a> of nutrients, thus allowing nutrient uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>-deficient native soils of Australia. Studies on "B. integrifolia" suggest that its proteoid root mat achieves this by chemically modifying its soil environment.
"B. integrifolia" flowers have an unusually short life span for "Banksia" species, producing <a href="nectar">nectar</a> for only about four to twelve days after anthesis. Most nectar is produced during the night and early in the morning, with only small amounts produced during the day. Flowers are produced all through the year, but there is a strong peak in autumn. Little else flowers within its range at this time, so it is a seasonally important source of food for <a href="nectarivore">nectariferous</a> animals. Surveys have observed a range of animals feeding on the species, including a wide range of <a href="insect">insect</a>s; many species of bird including "<a href="Phylidonyris%20novaehollandiae">Phylidonyris novaehollandiae</a>" (New Holland honeyeater), "<a href="Anthochaera%20carunculata">Anthochaera carunculata</a>" (red wattlebird), "<a href="Anthochaera%20chrysoptera">Anthochaera chrysoptera</a>" (little wattlebird), "<a href="Acanthorhynchus%20tenuirostris">Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris</a>" (eastern spinebill) and "<a href="Trichoglossus%20haematodus">Trichoglossus haematodus</a>" (rainbow lorikeet); and mammals such as "<a href="Petaurus%20norfolcensis">Petaurus norfolcensis</a>" (squirrel glider), "<a href="Petaurus%20breviceps">Petaurus breviceps</a>" (sugar glider), "<a href="Acrobates%20pygmaeus">Acrobates pygmaeus</a>" (feathertail glider) and "<a href="Pteropus%20poliocephalus">Pteropus poliocephalus</a>" (grey-headed flying fox). In some areas such as at <a href="Bungawalbin%20National%20Park">Bungawalbin National Park</a> in northern New South Wales, "B. integrifolia" is the only source of nectar and pollen in the autumn (March–April) and late winter (July). The importance of non-flying mammals to pollination of "B. integrifolia" was demonstrated in 1989, with a study in <a href="Wilsons%20Promontory%20National%20Park">Wilsons Promontory National Park</a> showing a reduction of fruit set when measures were taken to exclude them.

Unlike most "Banksia" species, "B. integrifolia" does not require <a href="bushfire">bushfire</a> to trigger the release of its seed. Rather, seed is released spontaneously on reaching maturity in late summer. The species' non-reliance on fire for seed dispersal suggests that the exclusion of fire would not affect plant populations, but a number of studies have found the opposite to be true: in areas where fire has been excluded for many years, populations have declined substantially. An investigation into the defoliation and premature death of trees on the <a href="Yanakie%20Isthmus">Yanakie Isthmus</a> in south Victoria reached the tentative conclusion that the absence of fire had created unhealthy surface soil conditions. On the <a href="Mornington%20Peninsula">Mornington Peninsula</a>, surveys of an area that had not been burnt since the 1890s found that "B. integrifolia" densities fell by 77% between 1977 and 2000. A subsequent study found the decline to have been caused by extremely high seedling mortality rates, due to grazing by <a href="herbivore">herbivore</a>s and intense competition for soil moisture during summer. Despite acknowledging that "the role of fire in these systems remains unclear", it concluded that "developing fire and/or grazing management regimes will be necessary to conserve the structural integrity of these coastal ecosystems."

These concerns aside, "B. integrifolia" does not appear to be under threat. It has excellent resistance to "<a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">Phytophthora cinnamomi</a>" dieback, which poses a major threat to many other "Banksia" species; and its wide distribution protects against the threat of habitat loss due to land clearing. As a result, it does not appear on the <a href="list%20of%20threatened%20Australian%20plants">list of threatened Australian plants</a> under the <a href="Environment%20Protection%20and%20Biodiversity%20Conservation%20Act%201999">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</a>.

Hardy and versatile, "B. integrifolia" will grow in <a href="clay">clay</a>, <a href="sand">sand</a>, <a href="acid">acid</a> and even <a href="alkali">alkali</a>ne soils, and it shows good resistance to wind and <a href="salt">salt</a>, making it suitable for seaside planting. It is therefore highly regarded as a low-maintenance garden tree, although its large size makes it unsuitable for smaller gardens. Its hardiness may however forewarn weed potential, as some evidence of weediness has been seen in <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a> and <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>. When growing near bushland within its native habitat, it is recommended to obtain local provenance seed or plants if available.

The most common form available in commercial nurseries is unimproved "Banksia integrifolia" subsp. "integrifolia". It prefers a sunny aspect without exposure to frosts, and tolerates fairly heavy <a href="pruning">pruning</a>. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 5 to 6 weeks to <a href="germinate">germinate</a>. Flowering begins at around four to six years from seed. The other subspecies are less well known in cultivation, but are obtainable. Cultivation is presumably similar to "B. integrifolia" subsp. "integrifolia", except that "B. integrifolia" subsp. "monticola" may be assumed frost-tolerant. <a href="Dwarfing">Dwarf</a> forms of "B. integrifolia" are sometimes sold, and a registered prostrate <a href="cultivar">cultivar</a>, <a href="Banksia%20%27Roller%20Coaster%27">"Banksia" 'Roller Coaster'</a>, is available. The latter is a vigorous ground-hugging plant that can spread to 4 or 5 metres across yet remains only 50 centimetres high.

Because of its high resistance to "P. cinnamomi" dieback, the feasibility of using "B. integrifolia" as a rootstock for susceptible "Banksia" species in the <a href="floriculture">cut flower trade</a> is under investigation. Presently, the success rate for grafting is only 30–40%, and even with successful grafts there is a tendency for the union to fail under stress. More research is needed before the technique will be ready for commercial use.

The <a href="wood">wood</a> of "B. integrifolia" is pink to red, with inconspicuous <a href="growth%20ring">rings</a> and conspicuous rays. It is spongy and porous, with a density of around 530 kilograms per cubic metre (33 lb/ft). It is considered highly decorative, but it warps badly on drying, has poor load-bearing qualities, and is susceptible to <a href="termite">termite</a> attack; it is therefore unsuitable for most construction purposes. It is sometimes used for cabinet panelling and in ornamental <a href="woodturning">turnery</a>, and natural bends were once sought after for making boat <a href="knee%20%28construction%29">knees</a>. It is a useful <a href="wood%20fuel">firewood</a>.

"B. integrifolia" produces a dark amber-coloured honey of middling quality and therefore low commercial value. Despite this, the species is highly valued by <a href="beekeeping">beekeepers</a> because it produces large amounts of pollen and nectar during autumn and winter, thus helping support <a href="beehive%20%28beekeeping%29">hives</a> at a time when little else is flowering.

Historically, <a href="indigenous%20Australians">indigenous Australians</a> obtained nectar from "B. integrifolia" by stroking the flower spikes then licking their hands, or by steeping flower spikes in a <a href="coolamon%20%28vessel%29">coolamon</a> overnight. They also used the flower spikes as <a href="hairbrush">hairbrush</a>es. Early settlers used the nectar as a syrup for sore throats and colds; and bushmen would impregnate barren "cones" with fat to make a slow-burning <a href="candle">candle</a>.

More recently, "B. integrifolia" has been used in the art of <a href="bonsai">bonsai</a>. Its rangy habit and long internodes are challenging to overcome, but the leaves do reduce with pruning, and unlike the gnarlier "<a href="Banksia%20serrata">B. serrata</a>" (saw banksia) its trunk can become textured with age.

It is used as a <a href="floral%20emblem">floral emblem</a> by two <a href="local%20government%20areas%20of%20Queensland">local government areas of Queensland</a>: the <a href="Redcliffe%2C%20Queensland">City of Redcliffe</a> and the <a href="Logan%20City%2C%20Queensland">City of Logan</a>. In 2000 it was featured on an <a href="Postage%20stamps%20and%20postal%20history%20of%20Australia">Australian postage stamp</a>.

Banksia serrata

Banksia serrata, commonly known as old man banksia, saw banksia, saw-tooth banksia and red honeysuckle, is a species of woody <a href="shrub">shrub</a> or tree of the genus "<a href="Banksia">Banksia</a>" in the family <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a>. <a href="Indigenous%20%28ecology%29">Native</a> to the east coast of Australia, it is found from <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> to <a href="Victoria%2C%20Australia">Victoria</a> with outlying populations on <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> and <a href="Flinders%20Island">Flinders Island</a>. Commonly growing as a gnarled tree up to 16 m (50 ft) in height, it can be much smaller in more exposed areas. This "Banksia" species has wrinkled grey bark, shiny dark green serrated leaves and large yellow or greyish-yellow flower spikes appearing over summer. The flower spikes, or <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s, turn grey as they age and pollinated flowers develop into large, grey, woody seed pods called <a href="Follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a>.

"B. serrata" is one of the four original "Banksia" species collected by <a href="Sir%20Joseph%20Banks">Sir Joseph Banks</a> in 1770, and one of four species published in 1782 as part of <a href="Carolus%20Linnaeus%20the%20Younger">Carolus Linnaeus the Younger</a>'s original description of the genus. There are no recognised <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">varieties</a>, although it is closely related to "<a href="Banksia%20aemula">Banksia aemula</a>". Throughout its range, it grows exclusively in sandy soils, and is usually the dominant plant in <a href="scrubland">scrubland</a> or low <a href="woodland">woodland</a>. "B. serrata" is <a href="pollination">pollinated</a> by and provides food for a wide array of <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a> and <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a> animals in the autumn and winter months, and is an important source of food for <a href="honeyeater">honeyeater</a>s. It is a common plant of parks and gardens.

"Banksia serrata" usually grows as a gnarled and misshapen tree up to 16 m (50 ft) tall, although in some coastal habitats it grows as a shrub of 1–3 m (3–10 ft), and on exposed coastal cliffs it has even been recorded as a <a href="prostrate%20shrub">prostrate shrub</a>. As a tree it usually has a single, stout trunk with warty, <a href="wikt%3Aknobbly">knobbly</a> grey bark up to 3 cm (1.2 in) thick. Trunks are often black from past <a href="Bushfires%20in%20Australia">bushfires</a>, and ooze a red sap when injured. New growth appears in spring, summer and autumn. New <a href="wikt%3Abranchlet">branchlets</a> are hairy, remaining so for two to three years. Leaves are usually crowded together at the upper end of branches, giving the <a href="Canopy%20%28biology%29">canopy</a> a thin, sparse appearance. The leaves themselves are dark glossy green above and light green below, (rarely up to ) long by (rarely up to ) wide, and oblong to <a href="wikt%3Aobovate">obovate</a> (egg-shaped) in shape. The leaf margins are serrated, except near the base, with lobes between deep.

Cylindrical flower spikes, or <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s, grow from the ends of 1–2 year-old branchlets and have leaves at their base. The spikes are generally wide with hundreds of individual flowers arising from an upright woody axis. The woody axis is high and wide. The flowers are cream-grey in colour with cream <a href="Gynoecium%23Pistils">styles</a>. Old flower spikes develop into "cones" that consist of up to thirty <a href="Follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a> that develop from the flowers that were pollinated. Old withered flower parts remain on the cones, giving them a hairy appearance. Each follicle is oval in shape, wrinkled in texture, covered with fine hair and long, thick, and wide.

The obovate seed is long, fairly flattened, has a papery <a href="Glossary%20of%20botanical%20terms%23W">wing</a> and weighs around . The seed is composed of the obovate seed body (containing the <a href="Plant%20embryogenesis">embryonic</a> plant) and measures long by wide. One side, termed the outer surface, is pitted and dark brown and the other is brown-black and warty, sparkling slightly. The seeds are separated in the follicle by a sturdy dark brown <a href="seed%20separator">seed separator</a>, which is about the same shape as the seeds, with a depression where the seed body sits adjacent to it. The first pair of leaves (called "<a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>s") produced by seedlings are obovate, dull green and measure long by wide. The <a href="auricle%20%28botany%29">auricle</a> at the base of the cotyledon leaf is pointed and measures long. The <a href="hypocotyl">hypocotyl</a> is thick, hairy and red. The cotyledons are linear to lance-shaped with the narrow end towards the base, long with serrated margins and a v-shaped <a href="sinus%20%28botany%29">sinus</a> at the tip.

"Banksia serrata" closely resembles "<a href="Banksia%20aemula">B. aemula</a>", but the latter can be distinguished by an orange-brown, rather than greyish, trunk, and adult leaves narrower than in diameter. The inflorescences of "B. serrata" are generally a duller grey-yellow in colour, have longer (23mm), more <a href="wikt%3Afusiform">fusiform</a> or cylindrical pollen presenters on the tips of unopened flowers and the follicles are smaller.

"Banksia serrata" was first collected at <a href="Botany%20Bay">Botany Bay</a> on 29 April 1770, by <a href="Joseph%20Banks">Sir Joseph Banks</a> and <a href="Daniel%20Solander">Daniel Solander</a>, naturalists on the British vessel "<a href="HMS%20Endeavour">HMS Endeavour</a>" during Lieutenant (later Captain) <a href="James%20Cook">James Cook</a>'s <a href="First%20voyage%20of%20James%20Cook">first voyage</a> to the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>. The species was not published until April 1782, when <a href="Carolus%20Linnaeus%20the%20Younger">Carolus Linnaeus the Younger</a> described the first four "Banksia" species in his "<a href="Supplementum%20Plantarum">Supplementum Plantarum</a>", commenting that it was the showiest species in the genus. As the first named species of the genus, "Banksia serrata" is considered the <a href="type%20species">type species</a>. "Banksia serrata" has the common names of old man banksia, saw banksia, saw-toothed banksia and saw-leaved banksia. It is also known as red honeysuckle and red banksia from the colour of its timber.

German botanist <a href="Joseph%20Gaertner">Joseph Gaertner</a> described "Banksia conchifera" in 1788 in the first volume of his work "<a href="De%20Fructibus%20et%20Seminibus%20Plantarum">De Fructibus et Seminibus Plantarum</a>". Alex George noted this description was taken from Linnaeus' original and was hence a "<a href="nomen%20illegitimum">nomen illegitimum</a>" (superfluous name). <a href="Joseph%20Knight%20%28horticulturist%29">Joseph Knight</a> described "Banksia mitis" and "Banksia serræfolia" in his 1809 "<a href="On%20the%20cultivation%20of%20the%20plants%20belonging%20to%20the%20natural%20order%20of%20Proteeae">On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae</a>", both later determined to be "B. serrata" and hence superfluous. In 1830, <a href="John%20Lindley">John Lindley</a> wrote of a plant in cultivation in England with short wavy leaves in "<a href="The%20Botanical%20Register">Edwards's Botanical Register</a>", giving it the name "Banksia undulata" "wavy-leaved banksia" but conceding it may have been a variety of "B. serrata".

Under <a href="Brown%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">Brown's taxonomic arrangement</a>, "B. serrata" was placed in <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a> "<a href="Banksia%20verae">Banksia verae</a>", the "true banksias", because the inflorescence is a typical "Banksia" flower spike. "Banksia verae" was renamed "<a href="Eubanksia">Eubanksia</a>" by <a href="Stephan%20Ladislaus%20Endlicher">Stephan Endlicher</a> in 1847, and demoted to <a href="Section%20%28botany%29">sectional</a> rank by <a href="Carl%20Meissner">Carl Meissner</a> in <a href="Meissner%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">his 1856 classification</a>. Meissner further divided "Eubanksia" into four <a href="Series%20%28botany%29">series</a>, placing "B. serrata" in series "<a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Quercinae">Quercinae</a>" on the basis of its toothed leaves. When <a href="George%20Bentham">George Bentham</a> published <a href="Bentham%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">his 1870 arrangement</a> in "<a href="Flora%20Australiensis">Flora Australiensis</a>", he discarded Meissner's series, replacing them with four <a href="Section%20%28botany%29">sections</a>. "B. serrata" was placed in "Orthostylis", a somewhat heterogeneous section containing 18 species.

In 1891, German botanist <a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a> challenged the generic name "Banksia" L.f., on the grounds that the name "Banksia" had previously been published in 1775 as "Banksia" <a href="Johann%20Reinhold%20Forster">J.R.Forst</a> & <a href="Georg%20Forster">G.Forst</a>, referring to the genus now known as "<a href="Pimelea">Pimelea</a>". Kuntze proposed "Sirmuellera" as an alternative, republishing "B. serrata" as "Sirmuellera serrata". English botanist <a href="James%20Britten">James Britten</a> proposed the genus name "Isostylis" in 1905, and hence called it "Isostylis serrata", for the same reasons as Kuntze. The challenges failed, and "Banksia" L.f. was formally <a href="Conserved%20name">conserved</a> in 1940.

<a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a> published a new taxonomic arrangement of "Banksia" in his 1981 monograph "<a href="The%20genus%20Banksia%20L.f.%20%28Proteaceae%29">The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)</a>". Endlicher's "Eubanksia" became <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">"B." subg. "Banksia"</a>, and was divided into three sections. "B. serrata" was placed in <a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Banksia">"B." sect. "Banksia"</a>, and this was further divided into nine series, placing "B. serrata" in <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Banksia">"B." ser. "Banksia"</a> (formerly "Orthostylis").

In 1996, <a href="Kevin%20Thiele">Kevin Thiele</a> and <a href="Pauline%20Ladiges">Pauline Ladiges</a> published a new arrangement for the genus, after <a href="cladistics">cladistic</a> analyses yielded a <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> significantly different from George's arrangement. <a href="Thiele%20and%20Ladiges%27%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement</a> retained "B. serrata" in series "Banksia", placing it in <a href="Banksia%20subser.%20Banksia">"B." subser. "Banksia"</a> along with "B. aemula" as its <a href="sister%20taxon">sister taxon</a> (united by their unusual seedling leaves) and "B. ornata" as its next closest relative. This arrangement stood until 1999, when George effectively reverted to his 1981 arrangement in his monograph for the "<a href="Flora%20of%20Australia%20%28series%29">Flora of Australia</a>" series.
Under <a href="George%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">George's taxonomic arrangement of "Banksia"</a>, "B. serrata" is placed in the <a href="Genus">Genus</a> "<a href="Banksia">Banksia</a>", <a href="Subgenus">Subgenus</a> "<a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">Banksia</a>", <a href="Section%20%28botany%29">Section</a> "<a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Banksia">Banksia</a>" and <a href="Series%20%28botany%29">Series</a> "<a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Banksia">Banksia</a>" along with "B. aemula", "<a href="Banksia%20ornata">B. ornata</a>", "<a href="Banksia%20baxteri">B. baxteri</a>", "<a href="Banksia%20speciosa">B. speciosa</a>", "<a href="Banksia%20menziesii">B. menziesii</a>", "<a href="Banksia%20candolleana">B. candolleana</a>" and "<a href="Banksia%20sceptrum">B. sceptrum</a>".

In 2002, a <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular</a> study by <a href="Austin%20Mast">Austin Mast</a> again showed that the three eastern species formed a natural group, or <a href="clade">clade</a>, but they were only distantly related to other members of the series "Banksia". Instead, they formed a sister group to a large group comprising the series <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Prostratae">Prostratae</a>, <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Ochraceae">Ochraceae</a>, <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Tetragonae">Tetragonae</a> (including "Banksia elderiana"), "<a href="Banksia%20lullfitzii">Banksia lullfitzii</a>" and "<a href="Banksia%20baueri">Banksia baueri</a>".

In 2005, Mast, Eric Jones and Shawn Havery published the results of their cladistic analyses of <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> data for "Banksia". They inferred a <a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a> greatly different from the accepted taxonomic arrangement, including finding "Banksia" to be <a href="paraphyly">paraphyletic</a> with respect to "<a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Dryandra">Dryandra</a>". A new taxonomic arrangement was not published at the time, but early in 2007 Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring "Dryandra" to "Banksia", and publishing <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Spathulatae">"B." subg. "Spathulatae"</a> for the species having spoon-shaped <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>s; in this way they also redefined the <a href="autonym%20%28botany%29">autonym</a> "B." subg. "Banksia". They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA <a href="sampling%20%28statistics%29">sampling</a> of "Dryandra" was complete. In the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then "B. serrata" is placed in "B." subg. "Banksia".

"Banksia serrata" is a fairly uniform species, showing little variation between different habitats other than occasionally occurring as a shrub in coastal areas. No subspecific taxa are recognised. In 1896, <a href="Richard%20Thomas%20Baker">Richard Thomas Baker</a> found a clump of "B. serrata" at Kelgoola on the <a href="Central%20Tablelands">Central Tablelands</a> with large leaves, with hairs on leaves and stems, further west of any other collection of the species. He named it "B. serrata" var. "hirsuta". In his 1981 monograph, George was unable to locate a collection that corresponded with the report.

"Banksia serrata" occurs on the Australian mainland from <a href="Wilsons%20Promontory">Wilsons Promontory</a>, <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> (39°08′ S) in the south, to <a href="Maryborough%2C%20Queensland">Maryborough, Queensland</a> (25°31′ S) in the north. There is also a large population at <a href="Sisters%20Creek%2C%20Tasmania">Sisters Creek</a> in <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> and another in the south west corner of the <a href="Wingaroo%20Nature%20Reserve">Wingaroo Nature Reserve</a> in the northern part of <a href="Flinders%20Island">Flinders Island</a>. The Wingaroo NR Conservation Plan (2000) reports that the population comprises around 60 to 80 individual trees, the majority of which are believed to be "quite old". It adds that there is evidence of slow and continuous regeneration, which appears to be occurring in the absence of fire.

Throughout its range, "Banksia serrata" is found on well-drained sandy soils that are low in nutrients, and is often found on stabilised soil near the coast but just behind the main dune system. In the Sydney region it is found with other typical woodland species, including yellow bloodwood ("<a href="Corymbia%20eximia">Corymbia eximia</a>"), red bloodwood ("<a href="Corymbia%20gummifera">C. gummifera</a>"), silvertop ash ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20sieberi">Eucalyptus sieberi</a>"), blue-leaved stringybark ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20agglomerata">E. agglomerata</a>") and Sydney peppermint ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20piperita">E. piperita</a>").

In the Upper <a href="Myall%20River">Myall River</a> region, "B. serrata" grows in dry sclerophyll forest on sandy soils that have recently formed (in the <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a>) or in shallow soils over differing substrates, while its close relative "B. aemula" grows on dry heath forest that occurs on ancient <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> sands that have not been disturbed in 125,000 years. In intermediate communities both species are found.

"Banksia serrata" is a component of the <a href="Eastern%20Suburbs%20Banksia%20Scrub">Eastern Suburbs Banksia Scrub</a> (ESBS), designated an endangered ecological community. This community is found on windblown sands which are younger than the heathlands to the north.

This species is a food source for several bird species. Nectar-eating birds that have been observed feeding at the flowers include <a href="bell%20miner">bell miner</a> ("Manorina melanophrys"), <a href="noisy%20miner">noisy miner</a> ("Manorina melanocephala"), <a href="white-cheeked%20honeyeater">white-cheeked honeyeater</a> ("Phylidonyris nigra"), <a href="New%20Holland%20honeyeater">New Holland honeyeater</a> ("Phylidonyris novaehollandiae"), <a href="white-eared%20honeyeater">white-eared honeyeater</a> ("Nesoptilotis leucotis"), <a href="brown%20honeyeater">brown honeyeater</a> ("Lichmera indistincta"), <a href="tawny-crowned%20honeyeater">tawny-crowned honeyeater</a> ("Gliciphila melanops"), <a href="white-naped%20honeyeater">white-naped honeyeater</a> ("Melithreptus lunatus"), <a href="white-plumed%20honeyeater">white-plumed honeyeater</a> ("Ptilotula penicillata"), <a href="crescent%20honeyeater">crescent honeyeater</a> ("Phylidonyris pyrrhopterus"), <a href="yellow-tufted%20honeyeater">yellow-tufted honeyeater</a> ("Lichenostomus melanops"), <a href="eastern%20spinebill">eastern spinebill</a> ("Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris"), <a href="red%20wattlebird">red wattlebird</a> ("Anthochaera carunculata"), <a href="little%20wattlebird">little wattlebird</a> ("A. chrysoptera"), <a href="noisy%20friarbird">noisy friarbird</a> ("Philemon corniculatus"), <a href="spangled%20drongo">spangled drongo</a> ("Dicrurus bracteatus"), and <a href="rainbow%20lorikeet">rainbow lorikeet</a> ("Trichoglossus moluccanus"). The immature follicles are eaten by <a href="yellow-tailed%20black%20cockatoo">yellow-tailed black cockatoo</a> ("Calyptorhynchus funereus").

A 1988 field study found that most flowers of "B. serrata" opened at night, and recorded the <a href="brown%20antechinus">brown antechinus</a> ("Antechinus stuartii"), <a href="sugar%20glider">sugar glider</a> ("Petaurus breviceps"), <a href="eastern%20pygmy%20possum">eastern pygmy possum</a> ("Cercartetus nanus"), and <a href="bush%20rat">bush rat</a> ("Rattus fuscipes") as nocturnal mammalian visitors and pollinators. Other mammals recorded eating the flowers include the <a href="grey-headed%20flying%20fox">grey-headed flying fox</a> ("Pteropus poliocephalus"), <a href="little%20red%20flying%20fox">little red flying fox</a> ("P. scapulatus") and <a href="common%20blossom%20bat">common blossom bat</a> ("Syconycteris australis"). "Banksia serrata" is a host plant for the larval and adult stages of the banksia jewel beetle ("<a href="Cyrioides%20imperialis">Cyrioides imperialis</a>"). Native bees and <a href="western%20honey%20bee">European honey bees</a> visit the flowers.

"Banksia serrata" has a central <a href="taproot">taproot</a> and few lateral roots. Clusters of fine branched <a href="Cluster%20root">proteoid roots</a> up to 15 cm (6 in) long arise from larger roots. These roots are particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, such as the <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>-deficient native soils of Australia.

"Banksia serrata" has shown a variable susceptibility to dieback from the pathogen "<a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">Phytophthora cinnamomi</a>", the plants in sandier soils showing more resistance than those in heavier soils. Plants from Wilsons Promontory were sensitive. The resistance of plants from Flinders Island is unknown. The small size of the stand renders it vulnerable to eradication.

"Banksia serrata" plants generally become fire tolerant by five to seven years of age in that they are able to resprout afterwards. Regrowth is generally from <a href="epicormic%20buds">epicormic buds</a> under their thick bark if the plant is between 2 and 6 m (7–20 ft) high or possibly from the woody subterranean base known as the <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a> of younger and smaller plants. There is doubt as to whether recovery from a lignotuber is possible, although it has been demonstrated in other "Banksia" species such as "<a href="Banksia%20menziesii">B. menziesii</a>". Stem size is a critical factor; stems with a <a href="Diameter%20at%20breast%20height">DBH</a> of under 1 cm (0.4 in) are unable to withstand low intensity fires. A stem/trunk DBH of 2 cm (0.8 in) is needed to survive low intensity fires and of around 5 cm (2 in) to withstand a high intensity fire.

As with other species in the genus, "B. serrata" trees are naturally adapted to the presence of regular bushfires and exhibit a form of <a href="serotiny">serotiny</a> known as <a href="pyriscence">pyriscence</a>. The seedbank in the plant's canopy is released after bushfire. Fire intervals of 10 to 15 years are recommended for the Eastern Suburbs Banksia Scrub, as longer leads to overgrowth by coastal tea tree ("<a href="Leptospermum%20laevigatum">Leptospermum laevigatum</a>"), while an interval of at least nine years was indicated in a study at <a href="Brisbane%20Water%20National%20Park">Brisbane Water National Park</a>. Repeated intervals of five years' duration or less will result in decline of population as young plants are not yet resistant to fire, and their tall <a href="Habit%20%28biology%29">habit</a> makes them especially vulnerable. The seedbank is most productive between 25 and 35 years after a previous fire, although seedlings may be outcompeted by seedlings of <a href="wikt%3Aobligate%23Adjective">obligate</a> seeder species. A field study found that seeds were dispersed up to from the parent plant in an hour by strong wind.

Seeds are also released spontaneously in the absence of fire. The degree to which "B. serrata" trees exhibit <a href="bradyspory">bradyspory</a> seems to depend on the nature of the site where they grow. One study recorded plants at coastal sites having more than 30% of their follicles open, compared to those further inland having fewer than 5% open. Follicles also open when part of the tree dies.

The gnarled lumpy bark, saw-toothed leaves and silvery-yellow spikes in bud are horticultural features of "B. serrata". It can be grown readily from seed, collected after heating the "cone". A sterile, free-draining seed-raising mixture prevents <a href="damping%20off">damping off</a>. In cultivation, though relatively resistant to "P. cinnamomi" dieback, it grows best in a well drained soil, preferably fairly sandy with a <a href="pH">pH</a> from 5.5 to 7.5, and a sunny aspect. Summer watering aids in growth. The plant may take several years to flower, although plants grown from cuttings may flower in two years. "Banksia serrata" is also used in <a href="bonsai">bonsai</a>.

Red-pink in colour, the timber resembles English oak. It has been used in boatbuilding and is strong, durable and distinctively patterned.

A species of <a href="butterwort">butterwort</a>, it forms summer <a href="Rosette%20%28botany%29">rosettes</a> of flat, <a href="succulent">succulent</a> leaves up to 10 centimeters (4 in) long, which are covered in <a href="mucilaginous">mucilaginous</a> (sticky) glands that attract, trap, and digest <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a> prey. Nutrients derived from the prey are used to supplement the nutrient-poor <a href="Substrate%20%28biology%29">substrate</a> that the plant grows in. In the winter the plant forms a non-carnivorous rosette of small, fleshy leaves that conserves energy while food and moisture supplies are low. Single pink, purple, or violet flowers appear twice a year on upright stalks up to 25 centimeters long.

The species was first collected by <a href="Alexander%20von%20Humboldt">Humboldt</a> and <a href="Aim%C3%A9%20Bonpland">Bonpland</a> on the outskirts of Mina de Morán in the <a href="Sierra%20de%20Pachuca">Sierra de Pachuca</a> of the modern-day Mexican state of <a href="Hidalgo%20%28state%29">Hidalgo</a> on their <a href="Alexander%20von%20Humboldt%23Latin%20American%20expedition">Latin American expedition</a> of 1799–1804. Based on these collections, Humboldt, Bonpland and <a href="Carl%20Sigismund%20Kunth">Carl Sigismund Kunth</a> described this species in "Nova Genera et Species Plantarum" in 1817. The extremely variable species has been redefined at least twice since, while several new species have been segregated from it based on various geographical or <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> distinctions, although the legitimacy of some of these is still debated. "P. moranensis" remains the most common and most widely distributed member of the <a href="List%20of%20Pinguicula%20species%23Section%20Orcheosanthus">Section "Orcheosanthus"</a>. It has long been cultivated for its carnivorous nature and attractive flowers, and is one of the most common <a href="butterwort">butterwort</a>s in cultivation.

The generic name "Pinguicula" is derived from the Latin "pinguis" (meaning "fat") due to the buttery texture of the surface of the carnivorous leaves. The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> "moranensis" refers to its <a href="Type%20%28biology%29">type</a> location, Mina de Moran.

"P. moranensis" is seasonally dimorphic, in that it undergoes two distinct growth habits throughout the year. During the summer when rain and insect prey are most plentiful, the plant forms a ground hugging rosette composed of 6–8 generally <a href="Leaf%20shape">obovate</a> leaves, each up to 95 millimeters (3¾ in) long. These leaves are carnivorous, having a large surface area densely covered with stalked mucilaginous glands with which they attract, trap, and digest arthropod prey, most commonly <a href="fly">flies</a>. These so-called "summer leaves" are replaced by "winter rosettes" of small, glandless succulent leaves with the onset of the dry season in October. This protective winter rosette allows the plant to undergo winter <a href="dormancy">dormancy</a> until the first rains begin in May. Flowers born singly on upright 10–25 centimeters (4–10 in.) <a href="Peduncle%20%28botany%29">peduncle</a>s emerge twice during the year (from the summer rosette and again from the winter rosette), a feature rare among the Mexican species. In the summer these appear in June, peak in August and September, and disappear with the return to the winter rosette in October or November.

The leaf blades of the summer rosettes of "P. moranensis" are smooth, rigid, and succulent, varying from bright yellow-green to maroon in colour. The <a href="leaf">laminae</a> are generally <a href="Leaf%20shape">obovate</a> to <a href="Leaf%20shape">orbicular</a>, between 5.5 and 13 centimeters (2–5 in.) long and supported by a 1 to 3.5 centimetre (⅜–1 ⅜ in.) <a href="petiole%20%28botany%29">petiole</a>.

As with all members of the genus, these leaf blades are densely covered by peduncular (stalked) <a href="mucilaginous">mucilaginous</a> <a href="gland">gland</a>s and <a href="Sessility%20%28botany%29">sessile</a> (flat) digestive glands. The peduncular glands consist of a few secretory cells on top of a single-celled stalk. These cells produce a mucilaginous secretion which forms visible droplets across the leaf surface. This wet appearance probably helps lure prey in search of water; a similar phenomenon is observed in the <a href="sundew">sundew</a>s. The droplets secrete only limited enzymes and serve mainly to entrap insects. On contact with an insect, the peduncular glands release additional mucilage from special reservoir cells located at the base of their stalks. The insect struggles, triggering more glands and encasing itself in mucilage. "P. moranensis" can bend its leaf edges slightly by <a href="thigmotropism">thigmotropism</a>, bringing additional glands into contact with the trapped insect. The sessile glands, which lie flat on the leaf surface, serve to digest the insect prey. Once the prey is entrapped by the peduncular glands and digestion begins, the initial flow of nitrogen triggers enzyme release by the sessile glands. These <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s, which include <a href="amylase">amylase</a>, <a href="esterase">esterase</a>, <a href="phosphatase">phosphatase</a>, <a href="protease">protease</a>, and <a href="ribonuclease">ribonuclease</a> break down the digestible components of the insect body. These fluids are then absorbed back into the leaf surface through <a href="Plant%20cuticle">cuticular</a> holes, leaving only the <a href="chitin">chitin</a> <a href="exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a> of the larger insects on the leaf surface.

The holes in the <a href="Plant%20cuticle">cuticle</a> which allow for this digestive mechanism pose a challenge for the plant, since they serve as breaks in the cuticle (waxy layer) that protects the plant from desiccation. As a result, "P. moranensis" is usually found in relatively humid environments. The production of the stalked capture glands and sessile digestive glands is also costly. A recent study found that the density of these respective glands can be correlated to environmental gradients. For example, capture gland density was found to be highest where prey availability was low, whereas digestive glands density showed direct correlation to prey availability. These results suggest that the amount of investment in carnivorous features is an adaptation to the environmental gradients.

The "winter" or "<a href="aestivation">resting</a>" rosette of "P. moranensis" is two to three (maximum five) centimeters (¾–2 in.) in diameter and consists of 60 to 100 or more small, fleshy, non-glandular leaves. These are each 10 to 30 millimeters (⅜–1 ¼ in.) long and three to eight millimeters (⅛– in.) wide, generally <a href="spatulate">spatulate</a> or oblong-spatulate, and densely covered with fine <a href="trichome">hairs</a>. The rosette is either open or compact and bulb-like, depending on <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a> (see <a href="Pinguicula%20moranensis%23Varieties">below</a>).

"P. moranensis" produces one to seven <a href="flower">flower</a>s during each flowering period. These are borne singly on upright flower stalks which are green to brown-green in color and usually, like the upper surface of the carnivorous leaves, are densely covered in glandular hairs; the peduncles do, in fact, trap insect prey. The peduncles are 10 to 25 centimeters (4–10 in.) long and taper from two to three millimeters (⅛ in.) at the base to one millimeter ( in.) at the top.
The flowers themselves are composed of five <a href="petal">petal</a>s which are fused at one end. The throat, the portion of the flower near the attachment point which holds the reproductive organs, is funnel shaped, and the petals flare out from there into a five-lobed <a href="zygomorphic">zygomorphic</a> <a href="Corolla%20%28flower%29">corolla</a>. The flowers 30 to 50 millimeters (1 ¼–2 in.) long. Below the attachment point to the stem the petals are fused into a 15–30 millimeter long spur which protrudes backwards roughly perpendicular to the rest of the flower.

The ovary and attached <a href="pistil">pistil</a> protrude from the top of the floral tube near its opening, with the receptive stigma surface toward the front. Two 1 millimeter <a href="anther">anther</a>s hang from recurved, 2 millimeter filaments behind the pistil. Pollinators exiting after collecting nectar from the spur brush against the anther, transferring pollen to the stigma of the next flower they visit. The flowers can last up to 10 days but will wilt once they are pollinated. Pollinated ovaries ripen into 5 millimeter ( in.) dehiscent seed capsules containing numerous 1 millimeter long seeds. The chromosome count for this species is 2n=44.
The color and morphology of the flowers of this species is extremely variable, a source of delight to the <a href="horticulture">horticulturist</a> and headache to the <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomist</a>. Some generalizations, however, can be made.

The corolla flares open into five lobes, two upper lobes and three lower lobes. The upper lobes are 7–16 millimeters (¼–⅜ in.) long by 4–9 millimeters (–⅜ in.) wide and generally oblong, obovate, or cuneate. The lower lobes are similarly shaped and are 7–20 millimeters (¼–¾ in.) long by 4–18 millimeters (–¾ in.) wide. The central lower lobe is usually slightly longer than its neighbors. All of the petal lobes have rounded ends. The floral tube that houses the reproductive organs and is visible at the base of corolla lobes is white or lilac in color and 4–6 millimeters (–¼ in.) long. The white color of the floral tube can extend to a variable distance onto the corolla lobes, particularly in a stripe on the lower middle lobe. The color of the corolla lobes generally varies from pink to purple, but has been described by collectors as being "purple, scarlet, rosy-lavender to bluish-purple, dark pink to lavender, pinkish-purple, deep violet-purple, dark purple, bright mauve-pink, bright purple-pink, magenta with [white eye], [and] reddish pale with white eye." A rare white-flowered form is also known.
Sergio Zamudio Ruiz, in his 2001 revision of the section "Orcheosanthus", called the identity and exact delimitation of "P. moranensis" "perhaps the most difficult problem to solve within the genus". This difficulty is due mainly to the high variability and large geographic distribution of the species, which has given rise to the description of many synonyms since the species was first described nearly 200 years ago. Botanists have attempted to delimitate the species through various morphological, ecological and genetic methods, though to this date some debate remains as to the placement and description of "P. moranensis" and its relationship to the species to which it is closely related.

Prior to <a href="Alexander%20von%20Humboldt">Alexander von Humboldt</a> and <a href="Aim%C3%A9%20Bonpland">Aimé Bonpland</a>'s <a href="Alexander%20von%20Humboldt%23Latin%20American%20expedition">Latin American expedition</a> in 1799–1804, only 8 "Pinguicula" species were known to science — 5 from Europe, 2 from North America and "<a href="Pinguicula%20involuta">P. involuta</a>" from <a href="Peru">Peru</a>. From 1803–1805, three additional species from Europe and North America were described, bringing the total of known species to 11. In 1817 <a href="Alexander%20von%20Humboldt">Humboldt</a>, <a href="Aim%C3%A9%20Bonpland">Bonpland</a> and <a href="Carl%20Sigismund%20Kunth">Carl Sigismund Kunth</a> described 3 new species from their Latin American expedition: The Peruvian "<a href="Pinguicula%20calyptrata">P. calyptrata</a>" and the first known Mexican species: "P. macrophylla" and "P. moranensis". At this point no infrageneric classification had yet been suggested.

In 1844 a French-Swiss botanist by the name of <a href="Alphonse%20Pyrame%20de%20Candolle">Alphonse Pyrame de Candolle</a> (who created the first Code of Botanical Nomenclature) proposed a division of the genus into three <a href="Section%20%28botany%29">sections</a> based on floral <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a>. He placed in the section "Orcheosanthus" those species with purple, deeply bilabiate <a href="Corolla%20%28flower%29">corolla</a>s with 5 sub-equal lobes, a short floral tube, and a large spur not protruding past this tube. He included four species in this section, all of them from Mexico: "<a href="Pinguicula%20oblongiloba">P. oblongiloba</a>", "<a href="Pinguicula%20orchidioides">P. orchidioides</a>", P. caudata and "P. moranensis". He excluded "P. macrophylla" on the grounds that it was a "dubious species".
The section "Orcheosanthus" grew as <a href="Charles%20Jacques%20%C3%89douard%20Morren">Charles Morren</a> described P. flos-mulionis in 1872, <a href="Eugene%20Fournier">Eugene Fournier</a> added P. sodalium in 1873 and Sander proposed P. bakeriana in 1881. In 1879–1888, however, botanist <a href="William%20Hemsley%20%28botanist%29">William Hemsley</a>, after studying multiple specimens in herbariums and in culture, came to the conclusion that all the taxa placed in the section "Orcheosanthus" up to that point belonged to the same single species. Due to doubts as to the identity of the original two species described by <a href="Alexander%20von%20Humboldt">H.</a><a href="Aim%C3%A9%20Bonpland">B.</a><a href="Carl%20Sigismund%20Kunth">K.</a>, Hemsley decided to use the name "P. caudata" for his conglomerate species. This name has been "indiscriminately" applied to members of the complex ever since.

When Barnhart revised the family <a href="Lentibulariaceae">Lentibulariaceae</a> in 1916, he recognized six species in the section "Orcheosanthus", admitting however that this number was likely to change as others studied the section in the future. Sprague in 1928 proposed that the species joined by Hemsley were probably distinct, but that they were likely so interrelated that distinguishing between them would require observing characteristics that were usually or always indistinct in dried specimens. Sprague recognized eight species in the section: "P. moranensis" , "P. caudata" , "P. oblongiloba", "P. flos-mulionis", "P. bakeriana", a "P. moranensis"-like P. rosei described by Watson in 1911, and the very distinct "<a href="Pinguicula%20gypsicola">P. gypsicola</a>".

In 1966 <a href="Siegfried%20Jost%20Casper">Casper</a> published the first ever monograph of the genus. He clearly defined his taxonomic organization according to a broad range of morphological and phenotypic characteristics. Casper considered "P. caudata", as well as various other taxa, to be synonyms of "P. moranensis". He therefore recognized only 6 species for the section "Orcheosanthus": "P. moranensis", "P. gypsicola", "P. macrophylla" , "P. oblongiloba", and the two recently discovered species "<a href="Pinguicula%20colimensis">P. colimensis</a>" and "<a href="Pinguicula%20cyclosecta">P. cyclosecta</a>". Since that time 14 additional species have been discovered and assigned to the section. When Zamudio redefined the section in 1999, however, he chose to include only 12 species, including all six of Casper's choices. "P. moranensis", therefore, remains in the section "Orcheosanthus", along with over a dozen synonyms it has inherited in its 200-year taxonomic history.

The varying importance which different authors have placed on various morphological characteristics when determining the taxonomy of the genus has long made the resulting subdivision of the genus a subject of controversy. Ruiz (2001) supported his revision of the section "Orcheosanthus" with a <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> analysis, using 20 morphological and phenological characteristics. In 2005, Cieslak et al. conducted the first comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the entire <a href="genus">genus</a> "Pinguicula". Using molecular data, they were able to isolate those morphological characteristics that were <a href="synapomorphy">synapomorphies</a> for various groups, providing evidence for a genetically based taxonomic structure. Their overall results did not support the placement of "P. moranensis" in the section "Orcheosanthus", rather indicating that it should be placed in the section "Longitubus" along with "P. laueana".

In further disagreement with Ruiz's 2001 revision of the section "Orcheosanthus", Cieslak et al.'s phylogenetic data indicated that "P. rectifolia" and several unnamed taxa that had been treated as synonyms of "P. moranensis" are in fact a distinct complex. They isolated several morphological characteristics that could be used to differentiate between the complexes, including floral spur length (longer in "P. moranensis"), flower color (never with a blue tinge in "P. moranensis"), and the shape of the lateral corolla lobe (exhibiting a twist in "P. rectifolia"). A more thorough study analyzing numerous "P. moranensis" populations and other members of closely related taxa is needed to resolve this complex.

After extensively studying "P. moranensis" in habitat, Ruiz (1999) came to the conclusion that the species could be divided into two distinct <a href="Variety%20%28biology%29">varieties</a>, mainly on the basis of the shape of the leaves composing their winter (resting) rosettes:

This variety has open winter rosettes composed of leaves which are spatulate in shape and have an obtuse or rounded end. It tends to grow in limestone-based substrates.
This variety has a closed, bulb-like rosette of winter leaves which are acicular (pointy) at the tip. It tends to grow on igneous substrates.

Ruiz also noted that these subspecies differed in their preference of soil substrate. He first noted this while attempting to find the population of plants from which <a href="Alexander%20von%20Humboldt">Humboldt</a> and <a href="Aim%C3%A9%20Bonpland">Bonpland</a> had collected their type specimens in 1803. Although Ruiz was able to find many populations of the species growing in the areas that Humboldt and Bonpland had visited in the vicinity if Mina de Moran, only one population, the only one growing on limestone, matched H.B.K.'s description and their type and isotype specimens now housed in the <a href="herbarium">herbarium</a> of the <a href="Mus%C3%A9um%20national%20d%27histoire%20naturelle">French national museum of natural history</a>. The other populations in the area grew on substrate of igneous origin and more closely matched <a href="William%20Jackson%20Hooker">Hooker's</a> 1846 description of "P. orchidioides". These latter plants then became the new variety, "P. moranensis" ssp. "neovolcanica".

"P. moranensis" is the most widely distributed member of the <a href="List%20of%20Pinguicula%20species%23Section%20Orcheosanthus">Section "Orcheosanthus"</a>. It is also the most common and widely distributed "Pinguicula" species in Mexico, being found in all the major mountain ranges except Sierra Madre Occidental and Baja California. Locations are known from the Mexican states of <a href="Tamaulipas">Tamaulipas</a>, <a href="Guanajuato">Guanajuato</a>, <a href="Nuevo%20Le%C3%B3n">Nuevo León</a>, <a href="Campeche">Campeche</a>, <a href="Chiapas">Chiapas</a>, <a href="Oaxaca">Oaxaca</a>, <a href="Puebla">Puebla</a>, <a href="Mexican%20Federal%20District">Distrito Federal</a>, <a href="Veracruz">Veracruz</a>, <a href="State%20of%20Mexico">México</a>, <a href="Quer%C3%A9taro">Querétaro</a>, <a href="San%20Luis%20Potos%C3%AD">San Luis Potosí</a>, <a href="Morelos">Morelos</a>, <a href="Hidalgo%20%28state%29">Hidalgo</a>, <a href="Guerrero">Guerrero</a>, <a href="Zacatecas">Zacatecas</a>, <a href="Tlaxcala">Tlaxcala</a>, <a href="Quintana%20Roo">Quintana Roo</a>, and <a href="Michoac%C3%A1n">Michoacán</a> and the <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>n <a href="Departments%20of%20Guatemala">departments</a> of <a href="Huehuetenango">Huehuetenango</a>, <a href="Quich%C3%A9%20Department">Quiché</a>, <a href="San%20Marcos%2C%20Guatemala">San Marcos</a>, <a href="Quetzaltenango">Quetzaltenango</a>, <a href="Totonicap%C3%A1n">Totonicapán</a>, <a href="Solol%C3%A1">Sololá</a>, <a href="Chimaltenango">Chimaltenango</a>, <a href="Baja%20Verapaz%20Department">Baja Verapaz</a>, <a href="Guatemala%20Department">Guatemala</a> and <a href="El%20Progreso%20Department">El Progreso</a>. Here it grows in mountainous regions between 800 and 3200 meters (2600–10500 ft) in altitude. Generally, the species tends to follow <a href="sedimentary">sedimentary</a> outcrops of the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> period. "P. moranensis" var. "neovolcanica", however, tends to grow on <a href="igneous">igneous</a> rocks of the <a href="Trans-Mexican%20Volcanic%20Belt">Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt</a>.

"P. moranensis" most often grows in oak, <a href="Madrean%20pine-oak%20woodlands">pine-oak</a>, or temperate montane woodlands. However, its distribution penetrates into tropical forests and <a href="xerophyte">xerophytic</a> shrublands, as well as in gorges and canyon walls with high environmental <a href="humidity">humidity</a>. "P. moranensis" prefers humid and shady environments, such as slopes by streams, gullies, or road cuts, or among leaf litter in sandy soil high in organic matter. Its ability to gather nutrients from the arthropod prey it catches allows it to grow in low-nutrient environments where other plants would usually out-compete it. As a result, it is often found in disturbed areas or on steep cliffs or hillsides. Since its roots do little more than provide anchorage, the plant requires little or no soil, and dense clusters can be found clinging onto boulders, moss or crags in rock faces, or even <a href="epiphyte">epiphytically</a> on tree trunks. Common companion plants include <a href="moss">moss</a>es, "<a href="Selaginella">Selaginella</a>", <a href="fern">fern</a>s and other herbaceous plants, as well as canopy trees such as <a href="pine">pine</a>s and <a href="oak">oak</a>s.

"P. moranensis" is one of the most popular and commonly cultivated "Pinguicula", in part due to its large size, large and pretty flowers, and the ease with which it can be grown as a container plant. Most growers use an open soil mix composed of some combination of washed <a href="sand">sand</a>, <a href="perlite">perlite</a>, <a href="vermiculite">vermiculite</a>, <a href="peat%20moss">peat moss</a>, <a href="gypsum">gypsum</a> and/or decomposed granite. Soil should be kept well drained, but watered regularly with <a href="distilled%20water">distilled water</a> in the summer and only very rarely once the plant enters its winter rosette. The species grows readily on well-lit windowsills, under fluorescent lights, or in warm to hot greenhouses.

Although no natural hybrids involving "P. moranensis" have been reported, the species is known to hybridize quite readily in cultivation. As a result, a number of <a href="cultivar">cultivar</a>s involving the species have been registered and are recognized by the <a href="International%20Carnivorous%20Plant%20Society">International Carnivorous Plant Society</a>:

Additionally, three clones of "P. moranensis" have been registered as cultivars:

The player <a href="player%20character">controls</a> the character Kratos in <a href="combo%20%28video%20gaming%29">combo-based combat</a>, <a href="platform%20game">platforming</a>, and <a href="puzzle%20video%20game">puzzle game</a> elements, and battles foes who primarily stem from <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, including <a href="harpy">harpies</a>, <a href="minotaur">minotaur</a>s, <a href="Gorgon">Gorgon</a>s, <a href="griffin">griffin</a>s, <a href="cyclops">cyclopes</a>, <a href="cerberus">cerberus</a>es, <a href="Siren%20%28mythology%29">Siren</a>s, <a href="satyr">satyr</a>s, and <a href="nymph">nymph</a>s. Other monsters were created specifically for the game, including <a href="undead">undead</a> legionnaires, ravens, undead barbarians, beast lords, rabid hounds, <a href="wild%20boar">wild boar</a>s, and the army of the Fates, including sentries, guardians, juggernauts, and high priests. Many of the combination attacks used in "God of War" reappear, and the game features more than double the amount of <a href="boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">boss fights</a> and more difficult puzzles than the original. Platforming elements require the player to climb walls and ladders, jump across chasms, swing on ropes, and balance across <a href="beam%20%28structure%29">beams</a> to proceed through sections of the game. Some puzzles are simple, such as moving a box so that the player can use it as a jumping-off point to access a pathway unreachable with normal jumping, while others are more complex, such as finding several items across different areas of the game to unlock one door.

In addition to the regular <a href="health%20%28gaming%29">health</a>, <a href="magic%20point">magic</a>, and <a href="experience%20point">experience</a> <a href="treasure%20chest%20%28video%20games%29">chests</a> that are found throughout the game world, there are three <a href="%C3%9Cber">Uber</a> Chests to be found. Two of these chests provide an additional increment to the Health and Magic Meters, respectively, and the third chest contains an abundance of red and gold orbs. Several urns are also hidden in the game (e.g., the Urn of Gaia) which, upon completion of the game, unlocks special abilities (e.g., unlimited magic) for use during <a href="New%20Game%20Plus">bonus play</a>.

Kratos' main weapon is a pair of blades attached to <a href="chain%20weapon">chains</a> that are wrapped around the character's wrists and forearms. Called <a href="Athena">Athena</a>'s Blades (also known as the Blades of Athena) in this game, they can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. As the game progresses, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Barbarian Hammer, the <a href="Holy%20Lance">Spear of Destiny</a>, and periodically, the Blade of Olympus—offering alternative combat options. Although Kratos begins the game with Athena's Blades and the magic ability Poseidon's Rage (both at maximum power), the blades' power is reduced and the magic is relinquished after an encounter with Zeus (Poseidon's Rage can be regained by obtaining a certain urn). As with previous games, Kratos learns to use up to four magical abilities, such as <a href="Typhon">Typhon</a>'s Bane that acts as a bow and arrow for distant targets, giving him a variety of ways to attack and kill enemies. Other new magical abilities include Cronos' Rage, Head of <a href="Euryale">Euryale</a>, and <a href="Atlas%20%28mythology%29">Atlas</a> Quake. The <a href="superpower%20%28ability%29">special ability</a> Rage of the Gods, featured in the previous game is replaced by Rage of the Titans; unlike the previous game, the Rage meter—which allows usage of the ability—does not have to be full in order to use the ability, and can be switched on and off at will.

Kratos retains the relic Poseidon's Trident from the original installment, and gains new relics; the Amulet of the Fates, the <a href="Golden%20Fleece">Golden Fleece</a>, and <a href="Icarus">Icarus</a>' Wings, each being required to advance through certain stages of the game. For example, the Amulet of the Fates slows time, but this does not affect Kratos and allows puzzle-solving that can not be achieved in normal game time. The Amulet of the Fates has limited usage before needing to be recharged (which occurs automatically and is represented by the Amulet of the Fates Meter). The Golden Fleece deflects enemy projectiles back at the enemies (used to solve certain puzzles). Icarus' Wings allows Kratos to glide across large chasms that cannot be crossed with normal jumping.

This game's challenge mode is called the Challenge of the Titans (seven trials), and requires players to complete a series of specific tasks (e.g., kill all enemies without being attacked). The player may <a href="unlockable%20%28gaming%29">unlock</a> bonus costumes for Kratos, behind-the-scenes videos, and <a href="concept%20art">concept art</a> of the characters and environments, as rewards, as well as usage of the abilities found in the urns during the first playthrough. Completion of each difficulty level unlocks additional rewards, as does collecting twenty eyes from defeated cyclopes. A new mode, called Arena of the Fates, allows players to set difficulty levels and choose their own opponents to improve their skills.

As with <a href="God%20of%20War%20%282005%20video%20game%29">its predecessor</a>, "God of War II" is set in an alternate version of <a href="ancient%20Greece">ancient Greece</a>, populated by the <a href="Twelve%20Olympians">Olympian Gods</a>, <a href="Titan%20%28mythology%29">Titans</a>, <a href="Greek%20Heroic%20Age">heroes</a>, and other beings of Greek mythology. With the exception of <a href="flashback%20%28narrative%29">flashbacks</a>, the events are set between those of the games "" (2007) and "<a href="God%20of%20War%20III">God of War III</a>" (2010). Several locations are explored, including a real-world setting in the ancient city of <a href="Rhodes%20%28city%29">Rhodes</a>, and several fictional locations, including a brief scene in the <a href="Greek%20underworld">Underworld</a>, the Lair of <a href="Typhon">Typhon</a>, the Island of Creation and its locales, <a href="Tartarus">Tartarus</a>, and a brief scene on <a href="Mount%20Olympus">Mount Olympus</a>.

Rhodes, its skyline dominated by the massive statue, the <a href="Colossus%20of%20Rhodes">Colossus of Rhodes</a>, is a war-torn city under assault by Kratos, the God of War, and his <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>n army. The Lair of Typhon, hidden in an unknown location, is a snow-topped mountain and prison of the Titans Typhon and <a href="Prometheus">Prometheus</a>. The Island of Creation is a vast island located at the edge of the world and home to the <a href="Moirai">Sisters of Fate</a>. The island is host to deadly traps, puzzles, and monsters. On the outskirts of the island are the Steeds of Time, and on the island itself are the Temples of <a href="Lachesis%20%28mythology%29">Lakhesis</a> and <a href="Atropos">Atropos</a>, and the Bog of the Forgotten, which hides the Gorgon <a href="Euryale%20%28Gorgon%29">Euryale</a> and is the site of <a href="Jason">Jason</a> of the <a href="Argonauts">Argonauts</a>' last battle. Beyond the Bog are the Lowlands and the Great Chasm: a huge divide that blocks the way to the Palace of the Fates. At the base of the Chasm is the realm of Tartarus—prison of the Titan <a href="Atlas%20%28mythology%29">Atlas</a>, condemned to hold the world on his shoulders. The Temple of the Fates is also filled with traps and monsters, while the final battle occurs on Mount Olympus, home to the gods.

The protagonist of the game is Kratos (voiced by <a href="Terrence%20C.%20Carson">Terrence C. Carson</a>), a Spartan warrior who became the God of War after killing the former, <a href="Ares">Ares</a>. Other characters include <a href="Athena">Athena</a> (<a href="Carole%20Ruggier">Carole Ruggier</a>), the Goddess of Wisdom; Zeus (<a href="Corey%20Burton">Corey Burton</a>), the King of the Gods and the main antagonist; several Titans—including <a href="Gaia%20%28mythology%29">Gaia</a> (<a href="Linda%20Hunt">Linda Hunt</a>), Atlas (<a href="Michael%20Clarke%20Duncan">Michael Clarke Duncan</a>), Prometheus (<a href="Alan%20Oppenheimer">Alan Oppenheimer</a>), Typhon (<a href="Fred%20Tatasciore">Fred Tatasciore</a>), and <a href="Cronus">Cronos</a> (<a href="Lloyd%20Sherr">Lloyd Sherr</a>)—heroes <a href="Theseus">Theseus</a> (<a href="Paul%20Eiding">Paul Eiding</a>) and <a href="Perseus">Perseus</a> (<a href="Harry%20Hamlin">Harry Hamlin</a>); the insane <a href="Icarus">Icarus</a> (<a href="Bob%20Joles">Bob Joles</a>); the Gorgon Euryale (<a href="Jennifer%20Martin">Jennifer Martin</a>); an undead version of the Barbarian King (Bob Joles); and the Sisters of Fate—<a href="Lachesis%20%28mythology%29">Lakhesis</a> (<a href="Leigh-Allyn%20Baker">Leigh-Allyn Baker</a>), <a href="Atropos">Atropos</a> (<a href="Debi%20Mae%20West">Debi Mae West</a>), and <a href="Clotho">Clotho</a> (<a href="Susan%20Silo">Susan Silo</a>). Minor characters include the boat captain (<a href="Keith%20Ferguson%20%28voice%20actor%29">Keith Ferguson</a>) and a loyal Spartan soldier (<a href="Josh%20Keaton">Josh Keaton</a>; credited as the Last Spartan). Kratos' wife Lysandra, their daughter Calliope, and the Titan <a href="Rhea%20%28mythology%29">Rhea</a> appear in flashbacks. The gods <a href="Hades">Hades</a> and <a href="Poseidon">Poseidon</a> appear in flashbacks of the <a href="Titanomachy">Great War</a>, and in the final cutscene alongside Zeus, <a href="Helios">Helios</a>, and <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a> on Olympus.

Kratos, the new God of War, is still haunted by nightmares of his past and is shunned by the other gods for his destructive ways. Ignoring Athena's warnings, Kratos joins the Spartan army in an attack on Rhodes, during which a giant eagle suddenly drains him of his powers and animates the <a href="Colossus%20of%20Rhodes">Colossus of Rhodes</a>. While battling the statue, Zeus offers Kratos the Blade of Olympus in order to defeat it, requiring Kratos to infuse the blade with the remainder of his godly power. Although now human, Kratos defeats the Colossus but is mortally wounded. The eagle reveals itself to have been Zeus all along, who states he was forced to intervene as Athena refused to do so. Zeus then grants Kratos a final opportunity to be loyal to the gods, but Kratos refuses. Zeus kills him with the blade and destroys the Spartan army.

Kratos is slowly dragged to the Underworld, but is saved by the Titan Gaia. Gaia tells Kratos that she once raised the young Zeus, who eventually betrayed the Titans as vengeance for the cruelty inflicted on his siblings by Zeus' father, Cronos. She instructs Kratos to find the "<a href="Moirai">Sisters of Fate</a>", who can alter time, prevent his death, and allow him his revenge on Zeus. With the aid of <a href="Pegasus">Pegasus</a>, Kratos finds the lair of Gaia's brother Typhon. Imprisoned under a mountain, Typhon is angered at the intrusion and traps Pegasus, forcing Kratos to explore on foot. Kratos encounters the Titan Prometheus, who is chained in mortal form and tortured at Zeus' directive for giving fire to mankind. Prometheus begs to be released from his torment, so Kratos confronts Typhon to steal his magical bow. He blinds the massive Titan with it to escape and then uses it to free Prometheus, who falls into a fire and dies, finally free of eternal torture. The Immolation releases the power of the Titans which Kratos absorbs, using it to free Pegasus and then fly to the Island of Creation.

Just before reaching the island, Kratos fights and kills Theseus to awaken the gigantic stone Steeds of Time—a gift to the Sisters of Fate from Cronos in an attempt to change his own fate—which grants Kratos access to the island. There, Kratos encounters and defeats several foes, some of whom-themselves are also seeking the Sisters of Fate, including an <a href="undead">undead</a> version of his old foe the Barbarian King, the Gorgon Euryale, Perseus, and Icarus. He eventually encounters the imprisoned Titan Atlas, who initially resents Kratos for his . After Kratos explains his intent, Atlas reveals that Gaia and the other Titans also seek revenge on Zeus for their defeat in the Great War. Atlas also reveals that the Blade of Olympus is the key to defeating Zeus and helps Kratos to reach the "Palace of the Fates".

After evading traps and defeating more enemies, including the <a href="Kraken">Kraken</a>, Kratos encounters an unseen foe, revealed to be a loyal Spartan soldier also in search of the Sisters. Before he dies, the soldier informs Kratos that Zeus has destroyed Sparta in Kratos' absence. Outraged, Kratos is further motivated and frees a <a href="Phoenix%20%28mythology%29">phoenix</a>, riding the creature to the Sisters' stronghold where he confronts two, <a href="Lakhesis">Lakhesis</a> and <a href="Atropos">Atropos</a>. After they refuse his request to alter time, Kratos battles them. During this, the Sisters try to change the outcome of Kratos' battle with Ares, but Kratos kills them both, then confronts the remaining Sister, <a href="Clotho">Clotho</a>. He kills her using her own traps, and acquires the "<a href="Textiles%20in%20mythology%20and%20folklore%23Greece">Loom of Fate</a>" in order to return to the point at which Zeus betrayed him.

Kratos surprises Zeus, seizes the Blade of Olympus, and finally incapacitates him. Athena intervenes and implores Kratos to stop, as by killing Zeus, he will destroy Olympus. Kratos ignores her and tries to kill Zeus, but Athena sacrifices herself by impaling herself upon the blade, granting Zeus' escape. Before she dies, Athena reveals that Kratos is actually Zeus' son. Zeus was afraid Kratos would usurp him, just as Zeus had usurped his own father, Cronos. Kratos declares that the rule of the gods is at an end, then travels back in time and rescues the Titans just before their defeat in the Great War. He returns with the Titans to the present, and the gods watch as their former foes climb Mount Olympus. Kratos, standing on the back of Gaia, declares that he has brought the destruction of Olympus, setting up the events of "God of War III".

A sequel to "God of War" was first teased at the end of its credits, which stated, "Kratos Will Return". "God of War II" was officially announced at the 2006 <a href="Game%20Developers%20Conference">Game Developers Conference</a> (GDC). "God of War" Game Director <a href="David%20Jaffe">David Jaffe</a> stepped down and became the Creative Director of its sequel. "God of War"s lead animator <a href="Cory%20Barlog">Cory Barlog</a> assumed the role of Game Director. In an interview with "<a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games">Computer and Video Games</a>" ("CVG") in June 2006, Barlog said that while working on the first few drafts of script, he studied the mythology extensively. He said that the mythology is so large that "the real difficulty is picking things that really fit within the story of Kratos as well as being easy to swallow for audiences." Although he loves the idea of teaching things through storytelling (in this case Greek mythology), Barlog said, "you can't let your story get bogged down by that." He said that in the game, players would see "a larger view of Kratos' role within the mythological world." He also said that he liked the idea of a trilogy, but there were no plans "as of right now."

Like "God of War", the game uses Santa Monica's <a href="Kinetica%20%28game%20engine%29">Kinetica</a> engine. Senior combat designer Derek Daniels said that for "God of War II", they were basing the magical attacks on <a href="classical%20element">elements</a> (e.g., air and earth). He said the combat system was updated so that it flowed smoothly between attacks and switching between weapons and magic. He said that they were working for a similar balance of puzzle solving, exploration, and combat seen in the first game, and they used elements that worked in that game as a base for the overall balance. Unlike "God of War" where magic had a small role, Daniels said that for "God of War II", their goal was to make magic an integral part of the combat system and to make it more refined. Barlog said the game would feature new creatures and heroes from the mythology, and he wanted to put more boss battles in it. Commenting on <a href="multiplayer">multiplayer</a> options, Barlog said that "there are possibilities for that but it is not something we are doing right now." He said that he felt that "God of War" is a single-player experience, and although multiplayer "would be cool," it did not appeal to him to work on. As for a <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a> (PSP) installment, he said that he thought it "would be freaking awesome," but not something he had time to work on and it was Sony's decision whether or not to make a PSP installment.

In an interview with <a href="IGN">IGN</a> in February 2007, Barlog said that his goals for "God of War II" were to continue the previous game's story, expand on several elements, and to feature more epic moments as opposed to cinematics during gameplay. He said there were many additions to the game, but they did not differ greatly from the style of the previous game. Set-pieces and large scale epic moments were reworked "so that each battle you have really feels epic and unique." Barlog also hinted that another sequel would be made; he said, "The story has not yet been completed. The end has only just begun."

In another interview with IGN, both Jaffe and Barlog said that they did not view "God of War II" as a sequel, but rather a continuation of the previous game. Jaffe said that they did not want to include the <a href="Roman%20numeral">Roman numeral</a> number two (II) in the title for this reason, but they did not want the title to convey the impression it was an <a href="expansion%20pack">expansion pack</a>. Both Jaffe and Barlog said that the reason "God of War II" appeared on the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> instead of the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a>—which was released four months prior to "God of War II"—was because "there's a 100 million people out there that will be able to play "God of War II" as soon as it launches." Barlog assured that the game would be playable on the newer platform, which had PlayStation 2 backwards-compatibility.

Four of the voice actors from the previous installment returned to reprise their roles, including Terrence C. Carson and Keith Ferguson, who voiced Kratos and the boat captain, respectively. Linda Hunt returned as the narrator, who was revealed to be the Titan Gaia, and Carole Ruggier returned in her final voicing of the character Athena. Both Paul Eiding, who had voiced Zeus and the gravedigger, and Fred Tatasciore, who had voiced Poseidon, returned but did not reprise those roles, and instead voiced the characters Theseus and Typhon, respectively. Corey Burton assumed the role of Zeus, having previously voiced the character in the 1998 <a href="Disney%20Television%20Animation">Disney</a> animated film "" and the subsequent animated series "<a href="Hercules%20%281998%20TV%20series%29">Hercules</a>". Famed actors Michael Clarke Duncan and Leigh-Allyn Baker lent their voices for the characters Atlas and Lakhesis, respectively. Actor Harry Hamlin was chosen to voice the character Perseus because of his previous portrayal of the same character in the 1981 feature film "<a href="Clash%20of%20the%20Titans%20%281981%20film%29">Clash of the Titans</a>". Although removed early in the game's development, <a href="Cam%20Clarke">Cam Clarke</a> is credited for the voice of <a href="Hercules">Hercules</a>. <a href="Keythe%20Farley">Keythe Farley</a> was the voice director alongside <a href="Kris%20Zimmerman">Kris Zimmerman</a> and <a href="Gordon%20Hunt%20%28director%29">Gordon Hunt</a>.

"God of War II" was released in North America on March 13, 2007, in Europe on April 27, and May 3 in Australia. It was released in Japan on October 25 by <a href="Capcom">Capcom</a>, under the title . The North American version was packaged in a two-disc set. The first disc contained the game, and the second disc was dedicated to the game's development, including a diary of the game's production. The European/Australian PAL version was released as two different editions: a single-disc standard edition and a two-disc "Special Edition" with different box art and a bonus DVD. On April 6, 2008, it became available in the PlayStation 2 line up of <a href="List%20of%20Sony%20Greatest%20Hits%20games">Greatest Hits</a>. Upon release, the game was banned in the <a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a> due to "one topless scene".

Upon release, "God of War II" was commercially successful in multiple markets. In North America, it sold 833,209 copies by the end of March 2007, twice as many copies as the next-best selling game. It was the best-selling game in the UK in the first week of release. It sold over one million copies in the first three months after release, and in June 2012, Sony reported it sold more than 4.24 million copies worldwide.

The game and its predecessor, "God of War", were released in North America on November 17, 2009 as part of the "<a href="God%20of%20War%20video%20game%20collections%23God%20of%20War%20Collection">God of War Collection</a>", featuring remastered <a href="porting">ports</a> of both games for the PlayStation 3 platform, with <a href="video%20scaler">upscaled</a> graphics and support for <a href="PlayStation%203%20Trophies">PlayStation 3 Trophies</a>. It became available in Japan on March 18, 2010, Australia on April 29, and the UK on April 30. The "God of War II Bonus Materials"—content included on the second disc of the original North American PlayStation 2 version—was included with the retail version of the collection. "God of War Collection" was released as a digital download on the <a href="PlayStation%20Store">PlayStation Store</a> on November 2, 2010, and was the first product containing PlayStation 2 software available via download. <a href="PlayStation%20Plus">PlayStation Plus</a> subscribers can download a one-hour trial of each game. The bonus materials, however, are not included in the digital download version.<ref name="GoWC 11/2"></ref> A <a href="PlayStation%20Vita">PlayStation Vita</a> version of "God of War Collection" was released on May 6, 2014. By June 2012, "God of War Collection" had sold more than 2.4 million copies worldwide. On August 28, 2012, "God of War Collection", "God of War III", and "" were included in the "<a href="God%20of%20War%20video%20game%20collections%23God%20of%20War%20Saga">God of War Saga</a>" under Sony's line of PlayStation Collections for the PlayStation 3 in North America.

As a pre-order incentive, the <a href="game%20demo">demo</a> disc of "God of War II" was made available to all customers who pre-ordered the game. On March 1, 2007, Sony held a media event that featured scantily clad women and a dead goat in Athens as part of the game's marketing campaign. The following month, the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" learned of the event from the UK "<a href="PlayStation%20Official%20Magazine%20%28UK%29">Official PlayStation Magazine</a>", called it a "depraved promotion stunt", and reported that <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> and anti-video game violence campaigner <a href="Keith%20Vaz">Keith Vaz</a> said he would understand if the incident resulted in a boycott of Sony products. In response, Sony said the event had been sensationalized with hyperbole and that the article contained several inaccuracies, but apologized for the event.

"God of War II: Original Soundtrack from the Video Game", composed by <a href="Gerard%20Marino">Gerard K. Marino</a>, <a href="Ron%20Fish">Ron Fish</a>, <a href="Mike%20Reagan">Mike Reagan</a>, and <a href="Cris%20Velasco">Cris Velasco</a>, was released on <a href="Compact%20Disc">CD</a> by Sony Computer Entertainment on April 10, 2007. Dave Valentine of Square Enix Music Online gave the soundtrack an 8 out of 10, and said that it features a wide variety of ominous orchestral pieces, and each composer's contributions seem slightly more distinctive than the previous installment. Spence D. of IGN wrote that the score "is an impressive orchestral accomplishment within the ever-growing and constantly changing arena of videogame composition," but that it was aimed more towards the gaming experience of "God of War II", rather than being a stand-alone musical experience. At the 2007 Spike Video Game Awards, the score was nominated for "Best Original Score". In March 2010, the soundtrack was released as <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable content</a> as part of the "God of War Trilogy Soundtrack" in the "God of War III Ultimate Edition".

An official novelization of the game, titled "God of War II", was announced in July 2009, along with a novelization of the original "<a href="God%20of%20War%20%282005%20video%20game%29%23Novel">God of War</a>". It was written by <a href="Robert%20E.%20Vardeman">Robert E. Vardeman</a> and published on February 12, 2013 by <a href="Del%20Rey%20Books">Del Rey Books</a> in North America, and on February 19, 2013 in Europe by <a href="Titan%20Books">Titan Books</a>. It is available in paperback, <a href="Amazon%20Kindle">Kindle</a>, and audio formats. The novel recounts the events of the game and adds even more layers than what the first book did in relation to the first game. The Sisters of Fate are given more story instead of only being the next to last boss fight of the game. They are introduced in Chapter 2 and have several chapters dedicated to what they were doing throughout Kratos' journey. For example, they allowed the Titans to come back due to their boredom and Lahkesis in particular liked to toy with Kratos. Due to how much the Sisters dabbled with Kratos' fate, it allowed him to make it as far as he did and also allowed him to act on his own will due to the many alterations to his life thread.

The intentions of some characters actions are also explained, and some characters are given more backstory. The Titan Typhon did not want to help Kratos because if he failed, Zeus would kill Typhon's wife <a href="Echidna%20%28mythology%29">Echidna</a> and their children, who Zeus had allowed to live in freedom while Typhon was imprisoned. Theseus, the King of Athens, wanted the Sisters to give the god <a href="Dionysus">Dionysus</a> a new lover so that he could have <a href="Ariadne">Ariadne</a> back, and wanted to revive his father <a href="Aegus">Aegus</a>, who committed suicide as he thought Theseus had died. Theseus had the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a> named after his father. Jason of the Argonauts had stolen the Golden Fleece from <a href="Ae%C3%ABtes">Aeëtes</a> of <a href="Colchis">Colchis</a>. He also loved a witch named <a href="Medea">Medea</a>, who helped him steal the Fleece by killing her own brother. She also convinced Jason's nieces to murder his uncle <a href="Pelias">Pelias</a> and eat him as Pelias was going to betray Jason due to a false prophecy. Jason forsook Medea and married the daughter of King <a href="Creon">Creon</a>, Creus, who was killed by Medea, along with their children. Despite this, Jason wanted Medea back because Creus did not truly love him. Jason died by Kratos' hand instead of the cerberus' as Jason tried to kill Kratos to get the Fleece back. Perseus was also given some backstory. He had fought the <a href="Graeae">Graeae</a>, a trio of witches. He fought the Gorgons and killed a monster that King <a href="Cepheus%20of%20Ethiopia">Cepheus</a> had tried to appease with a sacrifice. He wanted the Sisters to revive <a href="Andromeda%20%28mythology%29">Andromeda</a>, who was not explicitly mentioned in the game. 

The novel introduced some characters who were not present in the game, or any other game. The goddesses <a href="Demeter">Demeter</a> and <a href="Hestia">Hestia</a> both made a very brief appearance just prior to Kratos joining the Spartans in Rhodes where Kratos overheard them discussing their displeasure of the endless war in Greece. <a href="Iris%20%28mythology%29">Iris</a>, the Goddess of the Rainbow and an occasional messenger, was another new character and had a more substantial role. Atropos contacted Iris and had her lie to Zeus about Kratos on several instances, and was the cause of distrust among the Olympians due to her rumor spreading and half-truths. She eventually replaced Hermes as the Messenger of the Gods. She also told Zeus that he would need to appoint a new God of War. Zeus pondered about making Hercules the new God of War. Athena wished Kratos to be returned as the God of War, thinking by doing so, it would stop the chaos and dissension between the gods. Hermes had thought to suggest Perseus as the new God of War and gifted him his invisibility helmet. Hermes eventually regained his position as the Messenger of the Gods when he finally convinced Zeus that Iris had been lying to him about Kratos. Iris was subsequently banished from Olympus, only to appear at sunrise and sunset, and when it rained.

The novel also explained that the Titans Rhea, <a href="Themis">Themis</a>, <a href="Iapetus">Iapetus</a>, and <a href="Mnemosyne">Mnemosyne</a>, along with <a href="Hyperion%20%28mythology%29">Hyperion</a>, were banished to Tartarus after the Great War. At the end of the novel, the Titan Atlas was one of the Titans brought back from the past to reignite the Great War; in the game, Atlas was not brought back. Also in the game, Kratos and Theseus' fight was to determine who was the greatest warrior in all of Greece. This was not the bases for their fight in the novel. Another omission is that during Kratos' fight with the Barbarian King, the Boat Captain was not summoned to fight Kratos. Kratos also did not keep Euryale's head as a weapon. The first book omitted Kratos receiving the Blades of Athena; this book did not explain how he received them as he already had them at the start of the novel.

Regarded as one of the best PlayStation 2 and action games of all time, "God of War II" received "universal acclaim" according to <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregator</a> <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> with a score of 93 out of 100, and a score of 92.68% from <a href="GameRankings">GameRankings</a>. It has been praised for its story and improvements over its predecessor, such as gameplay and graphics. Chris Roper of IGN said that "God of War II" is "one of gaming's most intense and engaging experiences available." He said it "is practically devoid" of the minor flaws of the original, citing an example that players can now quickly navigate wall climbing, such as being able to vertically slide down walls. Furthering his praise of the gameplay, he said that it is one of the most "polished and refined experiences...in gaming." Although he said that the combat mechanics were practically identical to the original, he had no complaints, stating it is "for good reason as it was already perfect the first time out."

Kristan Reed of <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a> said that ""God of War II" sports one of the most satisfyingly honed game designs we've ever come across." He said that it would not overwhelm players and that it motivates them to improve their skills. He said that the balance "always feels spot-on," and the "learning curve is just right," adding that the magic attacks are more useful than those in "God of War". He also said that "God of War II"s gameplay, like the original, "finds a comfortable middle ground" between hardcore and casual players. Alex Navarro of <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> praised the pace of the game and the puzzle designs, and said the "scale of some of the levels is unbelievably massive." He also said that the story is interesting because it is more about what happens around Kratos, than what happens to him. Matt Leone of <a href="1UP.com">1UP</a> said that the strongest aspect "is how it excels as both a story and an action game," and it is the story that "allows the game to feel like a true sequel." Roper praised the scale of the levels, as well as the variety in environments, in comparison to the original installment, and said the art direction is "once again absolutely outstanding."

Reed praised the amount of detail and said that "at no stage did we ever see even a hint of frame-rate drop or v-syncing glitches." He also said that playing the game on the PS3 sharpens up the visuals. Navarro said that both the sound and graphics were "superb" and the technical graphics are impressive for the PlayStation 2. <a href="GameTrailers">GameTrailers</a> said that in terms of visuals, "there aren't that many PlayStation 2 games in the same league as "God of War II"." GameZone said that despite the issue of <a href="collision%20detection">clipping</a>, the game is "unbelievably gorgeous".

Roper said that there were a couple of puzzles "that seemed a little rough around the edges and whose otherwise straightforward solution suffered a bit from imperfect implementation." He also criticized the difficulty of unlocking some of the bonus content, as some requirements are "punishingly hard for most everyone." Reed, however, said if players can find any flaws, they are based on "personal taste", but also stated that regardless of refinement, "you can never quite replicate the wow factor of the original—even if it ends up being a better game." Navarro said that at times, the combat is "overly straightforward ... and still prone to button mashing," and said that it was "a bit disappointing" that more was not done to the combat system. He criticized the <a href="cliffhanger">cliffhanger</a> ending and said a few of the bonus challenges "aren't all that great." GameTrailers criticized the <a href="invisible%20wall">invisible wall</a>s, stating that "There are places you should be able to go that you simply can't." They also cited inconsistency issues in regards to navigation. Leone said his "only real" disappointment is that he did not feel the game was evolving the series.

Both IGN and GameSpot consider "God of War II" to be the "<a href="swan%20song">swan song</a>" of the PlayStation 2 era. In 2007, it was awarded "PlayStation Game of the Year" at the 25th annual <a href="Golden%20Joystick%20Awards">Golden Joystick Awards</a>, and <a href="UGO">UGO</a> awarded it "PS2 Game of the Year". At the 2007 <a href="Spike%20Video%20Game%20Awards">Spike Video Game Awards</a>, it was a nominee for "Best Action Game" and "Best Original Score". At the <a href="12th%20Satellite%20Awards">12th Satellite Awards</a>, "God of War II" received the <a href="Satellite%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Platform%20Action/Adventure%20Game">Outstanding Platform Action/Adventure Game</a> award. At the 2007 <a href="4th%20British%20Academy%20Video%20Games%20Awards">British Academy of Film and Television Arts</a> (BAFTA) Video Game Awards, "God of War II" received the "Story and Character" and "Technical Achievement" awards, and was a nominee for "Action and Adventure", "Original Score", and "Use of Audio". In 2009, IGN named "God of War II" the second-best PlayStation 2 game of all time—five ahead of its predecessor. In November 2012, "<a href="Complex%20%28magazine%29">Complex</a>" magazine named "God of War II" the best PlayStation 2 game of all time—where "God of War" was named the eleventh-best—and also considered it better than its successor, "God of War III".

Reg Saunders

Reginald Walter "Reg" Saunders, <a href="Member%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">MBE</a> (7 August 1920 – 2 March 1990) was the first <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Aboriginal Australian</a> to be <a href="officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">commissioned</a> as an officer in the <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a>. He came from a military family, his forebears having served in the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Boer War</a> and the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>. Enlisting as a soldier in 1940, he saw action during the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> in <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a>, <a href="Greece">Greece</a> and <a href="Crete">Crete</a>, before being commissioned as a <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> and serving as a <a href="platoon">platoon</a> commander in <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> during 1944–45. His younger brother Harry also joined the Army, and was killed in 1942.

After the war, Saunders was <a href="Demobilisation%20of%20the%20Australian%20military%20after%20World%20War%20II">demobilised</a> and returned to civilian life. He later served as a <a href="company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a> commander with the <a href="3rd%20Battalion%2C%20Royal%20Australian%20Regiment">3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment</a> (3 RAR) during the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>, where he fought at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kapyong">Battle of Kapyong</a>. Saunders left the Army in 1954 and worked in the logging and metal industries, before joining the Office of Aboriginal Affairs (later the <a href="Department%20of%20Aboriginal%20Affairs">Department of Aboriginal Affairs</a>) as a liaison officer in 1969. In 1971, he was appointed a <a href="Member%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Member of the Order of the British Empire</a> (MBE) for his community service. He died in 1990, aged 69.

Saunders was born near <a href="Purnim%2C%20Victoria">Purnim</a> on the <a href="Framlingham%2C%20Victoria">Framlingham Aboriginal Reserve</a> in western <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> on 7 August 1920. He was a member of the <a href="Gunditjmara%20people">Gunditjmara people</a>. His father, Chris, was a veteran of the First World War, having served as a machine gunner in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a>. One of his uncles, <a href="William%20Reginald%20Rawlings">William Reginald Rawlings</a>, who was killed in action and after whom Saunders was named, had been awarded the <a href="Military%20Medal">Military Medal</a> for service with the <a href="29th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">29th Battalion</a> in France. Another ancestor, John Brook, fought with the <a href="Royal%20Victoria%20Regiment">Victorian Rifles</a> and the <a href="Australian%20Commonwealth%20Horse">Australian Commonwealth Horse</a> in the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Boer War</a>. Saunders' mother died in 1924 from complications caused by pneumonia while giving birth to her third child, a girl who also died. After this, his father moved to <a href="Condah%2C%20Victoria">Lake Condah</a> in Victoria, with Reg and his younger brother, Harry, born in 1922. As their father undertook various labouring jobs, the two boys were raised largely by their grandmother.

Saunders attended the local <a href="Mission%20%28Christianity%29">mission school</a> at Lake Condah, where he did well in maths, geometry and languages. His father, meanwhile, taught Reg and Harry about <a href="the%20bush">the bush</a>, and encouraged them to read <a href="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> and Australian literature. After completing eight years of schooling, Saunders earned his merit certificate. His formal education thus ended, he went to work at the age of 14 as a millhand in a sawmill. Employers regularly withheld payments for Aboriginal labourers at this time, but Saunders refused to work unless he was paid his full entitlement, and his employer relented. He worked and furthered his education until 1937, when he went into business with his father and brother, operating a sawmill in <a href="Portland%2C%20Victoria">Portland</a>, Victoria; the sawmill was destroyed in a bushfire in 1939.

Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Saunders was determined to serve in the armed forces. Patriotism and his family's history of soldiering both played a major part in his decision. His father suggested that he wait six months; according to Reg, "They were talking about this war being all over in six months with the <a href="Maginot%20Line">Maginot Line</a> and all the other garbage that we were told ... But we waited six months and the duck season was over so there was no more shooting to do except go to war". Saunders enlisted in the <a href="Second%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Second Australian Imperial Force</a> on 24 April 1940, joining up with friends he had made while playing <a href="Australian%20rules%20football">Australian rules football</a>. The armed forces later adopted a policy to accept only persons "substantially of European origin or descent", but at the time Saunders encountered no barriers to his enlistment. He recalled that his fellow soldiers "were not colour-conscious", and that during training in northern <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> his white mates would sit alongside him in the "Aboriginal" section of movie theatres. His natural leadership qualities gained him temporary promotions in quick succession: within six weeks of enlistment he was a <a href="lance%20corporal">lance corporal</a>, and after three months he made <a href="sergeant">sergeant</a>.

After completing his training, Saunders was allocated to an infantry unit, the <a href="2/7th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/7th Battalion</a>, which was serving overseas in North Africa at the time. Upon reaching the 2/7th, Saunders reverted to the rank of private. His first experience of war came fighting the Italians around <a href="Benghazi">Benghazi</a>. In early April 1941, the <a href="6th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">6th Division</a>, to which the 2/7th belonged, was sent to Greece to help defend against a <a href="Battle%20of%20Greece">German invasion</a>. Following a series of withdrawals, the battalion was evacuated on 26 April, embarking upon the "Costa Rica" at Kalamata. It was originally bound for <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, but after the ship was attacked in <a href="Suda%20Bay">Suda Bay</a> by German aircraft and began to sink, the men of the 2/7th, including Saunders, were picked up by several British destroyers and disembarked on the island of <a href="Crete">Crete</a>. The 2/7th was subsequently allocated to the island's defending garrison.

Following the <a href="Battle%20of%20Crete">invasion of Crete</a> in May 1941, the 2/7th Battalion was initially employed in a coastal defence role, before taking part in the fighting around <a href="Chania">Canea</a>. After this, it took part in a devastating bayonet charge at 42nd Street, along with the New Zealand <a href="Maori%20Battalion">Maori Battalion</a>, which killed almost 300 Germans and briefly checked their advance. It was during this battle that Saunders killed his first opponent: "... I saw a German soldier stand up in clear view about thirty yards [30 m] away. He was my first sure kill ... I can remember for a moment that it was just like shooting a kangaroo ... just as remote." As the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a> began to evacuate the island, the 2/7th was called upon to carry out a series of rearguard actions in order to allow other units to be taken off the island. After the final Allied ships departed the island on 1 June 1941, the battalion was left behind. As a result, many of its men were taken prisoner, though some were able to evade capture by hiding out in the hills and caves around the island. Adopting Cretan dress, learning the dialect, and enlisting the help of local inhabitants, Saunders managed to remain hidden for eleven months.
Saunders was among a party of men evacuated from Crete by a British submarine in May 1942, and returned to Australia in October. He rejoined his old unit, the 2/7th Battalion, which had re-formed in Palestine and been brought back to Australia along with the rest of the 6th Division to help defend against the threat posed by Japan's entry into the war. In November 1942, Saunders' younger brother Harry, who had enlisted shortly after him in 1940, was <a href="killed%20in%20action">killed in action</a> while serving in <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea</a> with the <a href="2/14th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/14th Battalion</a>. When Harry had joined up, Reg recalled, "I was angry because I was the only one that was supposed to go. ... with two of us there, one of us was going to get killed ..." The elder Saunders subsequently served in New Guinea as well, fighting in the <a href="Salamaua%E2%80%93Lae%20campaign">Salamaua–Lae campaign</a> in mid-1943 where, having again been promoted temporary sergeant, he took over command of a <a href="platoon">platoon</a> when its commander was wounded in action. For his leadership, he was recommended for a <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">commission</a> by his commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Guinn. When Guinn told him of his plan, Saunders laughed and said, "I don't want to be an officer ... I'd rather be <a href="Regimental%20Sergeant%20Major">Regimental Sergeant Major</a>". Guinn responded, "Christ, they don't make boys RSMs".

Saunders went before an officer selection board that had been set up on the <a href="Atherton%20Tablelands">Atherton Tablelands</a> in Queensland, where the units of the 6th Division had been based following their return from New Guinea. The interview panel on the board consisted of three senior officers – all experienced infantry battalion commanders – who were tasked with determining a candidate's suitability for commissioning as an infantry officer. Saunders was found to be an acceptable candidate and posted to an officer training unit in <a href="Seymour%2C%20Victoria">Seymour</a>, Victoria. Upon completion of the 16-week course, he was promoted to <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> in November 1944, becoming the first Aboriginal commissioned officer in the Australian Army. The precedent of his commissioning had caused the Army some concern due to its "special significance", and as a result the paperwork for its confirmation was eventually sent to the Commander-in-Chief, General <a href="Thomas%20Blamey">Sir Thomas Blamey</a>, for approval. Nevertheless, Blamey is reported to have "insisted upon following the usual procedure", believing that there should be no difference in the way Saunders' commission should be treated to any other soldier who had completed the necessary training. The story garnered much press coverage in Australia, most of it favourable, if in parts paternalistic.

After his promotion was confirmed, Saunders returned to New Guinea and, although it was contrary to policy, rejoined his old battalion. He subsequently took part in the <a href="Aitape%E2%80%93Wewak%20campaign">Aitape–Wewak campaign</a>, commanding a platoon until the end of the war. Due to the discriminatory laws in force at the time, Saunders had fewer rights as a citizen than the white Australians he led. He was wounded in the knee by Japanese gunfire during fighting around <a href="Maprik%20District">Maprik</a>, and was hospitalised for three weeks as a result.

Saunders was discharged from the Army on 5 October 1945, following the end of the Second World War. Returning to Australia, he volunteered for service in Japan with the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Occupation%20Force">British Commonwealth Occupation Force</a>, but the government would not accept Aborigines for the operation. Saunders spoke publicly against this policy, calling it "narrow-minded and ignorant"; the wartime restriction on non-European enlistments in the armed forces was not lifted until 1949. Saunders moved to Melbourne with his family, which by this time consisted of his wife Dorothy, whom he had married in 1944, and their three young children. Dorothy had served in the <a href="Women%27s%20Auxiliary%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force</a> during the war. Saunders recalled that he "had a hard time after the war ... and poor old Dotty, she, you know, didn't know what the hell to make of it". Facing discrimination that he had rarely encountered as a soldier, he worked in the ensuing years as a tram conductor, a foundry worker, and a shipping clerk.

In August 1950, the government called for Second World War veterans to serve in the Korea War as part of the specially raised 'K' Force. Saunders volunteered and returned to the Army as a lieutenant. After training at <a href="Puckapunyal%2C%20Victoria">Puckapunyal, Victoria</a>, and in Japan, he arrived in Korea in November 1950. He served with the <a href="3rd%20Battalion%2C%20Royal%20Australian%20Regiment">3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment</a> (3 RAR), initially as a platoon commander in A Company. In February 1951, he took charge of A Company when its commander was wounded; he was subsequently given command of C Company. Promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">captain</a>, Saunders led C Company during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kapyong">Battle of Kapyong</a> in April, when 3 RAR and a Canadian battalion held off a Chinese division north-east of the South Korean capital <a href="Seoul">Seoul</a>. Frustrated by the conduct of the war prior to Kapyong, he afterwards recorded that, "At last I felt like an <a href="Australian%20and%20New%20Zealand%20Army%20Corps">Anzac</a> and I imagine there were 600 others like me". The 3rd Battalion was awarded a <a href="Presidential%20Unit%20Citation%20%28United%20States%29">US Presidential Unit Citation</a> for its part in the action. Saunders himself was recommended for a decoration but turned it down. Leading a <a href="Vickers%20machine%20gun">Vickers machine gun</a> platoon at the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Maryang%20San">Battle of Maryang San</a> in October, he reportedly shared the following exchange with a fellow 3 RAR officer: as they surveyed the forbidding mountain before them, Saunders' companion remarked, "No country for white men", to which Saunders replied, "It's no country for black men, either". He returned to Australia in November 1951.

In 1953 the <a href="Returned%20and%20Services%20League%20of%20Australia">Returned and Services League</a> (RSL), a veterans organisation, recommended Saunders for inclusion in the official Australian contingent to the <a href="Coronation%20of%20Queen%20Elizabeth%20II">coronation of Elizabeth II</a>; the Federal government rejected the suggestion on the grounds that including Saunders would have meant excluding an officer who had been previously selected. Following his service in the Korean War, Saunders remained in the Army overseeing training for <a href="Conscription%20in%20Australia">national servicemen</a> at Puckapunyal. Away from active service, however, he soon became dissatisfied and in 1954 was discharged at his own request. The same year, he married an Irish nurse, Pat Montgomery; his first marriage had broken down soon after he returned from Korea.

Saunders went to work in the logging industry in <a href="Gippsland">Gippsland</a>, after which he moved to <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, where he was employed by the Austral Bronze Company. Seen by many as a role model and spokesman for Aboriginal Australians, in 1969 Saunders took up a position in the <a href="Office%20of%20Aboriginal%20Affairs">Office of Aboriginal Affairs</a> as one of its first liaison officers. Among his tasks was promulgating information on recently legislated Federal funding for Aboriginal and <a href="Torres%20Strait%20Islander">Torres Strait Islander</a> businesses and schooling, following up on recommendations made to government departments, and liaising with Aboriginal welfare groups. He later stated, "I felt a sense of leadership of Aboriginal people and a desire to do something about the Aboriginal situation". His community work was recognised in the <a href="Queen%27s%20Birthday%20Honours">Queen's Birthday Honours</a> of June 1971 when he was appointed a <a href="Member%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Member of the Order of the British Empire</a> (MBE) in the Civil Division. He continued to serve with the <a href="Department%20of%20Aboriginal%20Affairs">Department of Aboriginal Affairs</a> in Canberra until retiring in 1980. In July 1985 he was appointed to the Council of the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a>, and held this position until his retirement. He was also involved in the RSL, though he fell out with leaders <a href="Alf%20Garland">Alf Garland</a> and <a href="Bruce%20Ruxton">Bruce Ruxton</a> over Garland's suggestion that Aborigines be blood-tested to determine their entitlement to government benefits. "They can take all the blood they want from me," Saunders declared in a 1986 interview, "and they'll never find out what I am – least of all an Aborigine – bloody stupid!"

During his two marriages, both of which ended in divorce, Saunders fathered ten children, two of whom predeceased him. Having suffered recent heart trouble, he died on 2 March 1990. His ashes were scattered on Lake Condah, traditional territory of the Gunditjmara people. Of Saunders' children, one of his sons followed him into the Army, while four of his daughters married soldiers. His son Christopher portrayed him in a 1978 episode of the television series "<a href="The%20Sullivans">The Sullivans</a>".

On 14 December 2001, Saunders was honoured with the dedication of Reg Saunders Way, which passes through the Canberra suburbs of <a href="Campbell%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Campbell</a> and <a href="Russell%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Russell</a>, in a ceremony attended by the Secretary of the <a href="Department%20of%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Department of Defence</a>, Dr <a href="Allan%20Hawke">Allan Hawke</a>, and the <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Defence%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Defence Force</a>, Admiral <a href="Chris%20Barrie%20%28admiral%29">Chris Barrie</a>. Saunders was also commemorated with a room in the Canberra Services Club, and by the RSL's Captain Reg Saunders Scholarship. The Australian War Memorial holds Saunders' medals and several personal effects in its national collection, along with an official portrait and several photographs. On 11 November 2015 the Australian War Memorial's Western Gallery and Courtyard were renamed in Saunders' honour. These were the first sections of the Memorial to be named after any Australian.

White Deer Hole Creek

White Deer Hole Creek is a <a href="tributary">tributary</a> of the <a href="West%20Branch%20Susquehanna%20River">West Branch Susquehanna River</a> in <a href="Clinton%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Clinton</a>, <a href="Lycoming%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Lycoming</a> and <a href="Union%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Union</a> counties in the U.S. state of <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. A part of the <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a> drainage basin, the White Deer Hole Creek <a href="Drainage%20basin">watershed</a> drains parts of ten <a href="Township%20%28Pennsylvania%29">townships</a>. The creek flows east in a valley of the <a href="Ridge-and-valley%20Appalachians">Ridge-and-valley Appalachians</a>, through sandstone, limestone, and shale from the <a href="Ordovician">Ordovician</a>, <a href="Silurian">Silurian</a>, and <a href="Devonian">Devonian</a> periods.

As of 2006, the creek and its watershed are relatively undeveloped, with 28.4 percent of the watershed given to agriculture and 71.6 percent covered by forest, including part of <a href="Tiadaghton%20State%20Forest">Tiadaghton State Forest</a>. The western part of White Deer Hole Creek has very high water quality and is the only major creek section in Lycoming County classified as <a href="Class%20A%20Wild%20Trout%20Waters">Class A Wild Trout Waters</a>, defined by the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Fish%20and%20Boat%20Commission">Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission</a> as "streams which support a population of naturally produced trout of sufficient size and abundance to support a long-term and rewarding sport fishery." The rest of the creek and its major tributary (<a href="Spring%20Creek%20%28White%20Deer%20Hole%20Creek%29">Spring Creek</a>) are kept <a href="Fish%20stocking">stocked</a>. There are opportunities in the watershed for <a href="canoeing">canoeing</a>, <a href="hunting">hunting</a>, and <a href="camping">camping</a>, and <a href="trail">trail</a>s for <a href="hiking">hiking</a> and <a href="equestrianism">horseback riding</a>.

Historically, two paths of the native <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20in%20the%20United%20States">indigenous peoples</a> ran along parts of White Deer Hole Creek. Settlers arrived by 1770, but fled in 1778 during the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolutionary War</a>. They returned and the creek served as the southern boundary of Lycoming County when it was formed on April 13, 1795. A logging railroad ran along the creek from 1901 to 1904 for timber <a href="clearcutting">clearcutting</a>, and small-scale lumbering continues. During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> a <a href="Trinitrotoluene">Trinitrotoluene</a> (TNT) plant, which became a federal prison in 1952, was built in the watershed. Most development is in the eastern end of the valley, with two <a href="unincorporated%20area">unincorporated</a> villages, a hamlet, and most of the farms (many <a href="Amish">Amish</a>).

Two <a href="etymology">etymologies</a> have been suggested for White Deer Hole Creek's unusual name. According to Donehoo, it is a translation of the <a href="Lenape%20language">Lenape</a> (or Delaware) "Woap-achtu-woalhen" (meaning "white-deer digs a hole"). It is "Opauchtooalin" on the earliest map showing the creek (1755), while a 1759 map has both "Opaghtanoten" and its translation, "White Flint Creek". By 1770 (when the first settlers arrived) a map has "White Deer hole".

In 1870, 88-year-old John Farley gave a second explanation of the name. His family had settled on the banks of White Deer Hole Creek in 1787, and John's father John built a mill on the creek by 1789. The creek was named because "a white deer is said to have been killed at an early day in a low hole or pond of water that once existed where my father built his mill". The hole was "a large circular basin of low ground of some ten acres [(four ha)] in extent...after my father's mill and dam were built the water of the dam overflowed and covered the most of the hollow basin of ground." The mill was just west of the mouth at the unincorporated village of Allenwood (then called Uniontown), now in Gregg Township in Union County.

The name "White Deer Hole Creek" is unique in the <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">USGS</a> <a href="Geographic%20Names%20Information%20System">Geographic Names Information System</a> and on its maps of the United States. Although the whole creek is now referred to by this name, in 1870 the name applied only to the section from the confluence with Spring Creek east to its mouth, while the main branch west of Spring Creek was called "South Creek". Meginness used this name in 1892 and it appeared on a 1915 state map of Union County (but not the 1916 Lycoming County map). In 2009 the name "South Creek" has disappeared, but there is still a "South Creek Road" on the right bank of the creek in Gregg Township from near the mouth of Spring Creek west to the county line.

According to Meginness, the long and wide White Deer Hole Creek valley was just called "White Deer valley" by many in 1892, and this is still common. Confusion about the names arises since <a href="White%20Deer%20Creek">White Deer Creek</a> is the next creek south of White Deer Hole Creek (they are on opposite sides of South White Deer Ridge). The Lenape name for White Deer Creek was "Woap'-achtu-hanne" (translated as "white-deer stream").

Spring Creek is the only named tributary of White Deer Hole Creek. Five unnamed tributaries flow through named features of South White Deer Ridge. Going upstream in order they are: <a href="Beartrap%20Hollow">Beartrap Hollow</a>, First Gap, Second Gap, Third Gap, and Fourth Gap.

Lycoming County is about northwest of <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> and east-northeast of <a href="Pittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania">Pittsburgh</a>. The source of White Deer Hole Creek is in Crawford Township, just over the Clinton County line. Both it and the western half of the creek are within Tiadaghton State Forest. The creek flows east and soon crosses a natural gas <a href="pipeline%20transport">pipeline</a> and the Lycoming County line into <a href="Limestone%20Township%2C%20Lycoming%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Limestone Township</a>.

It soon flows into <a href="Washington%20Township%2C%20Lycoming%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Washington Township</a>, which has more of White Deer Hole Creek than any other township. It receives unnamed tributaries in the Fourth, Third, Second, and First Gaps of South White Deer Ridge on the south or right bank. The creek leaves Tiadaghton State Forest after the Third Gap (the forest itself continues along the ridge to the river), and stops being "Class A Wild Trout Waters" between the Second and First Gaps. It receives the unnamed tributary in Beartrap Hollow upstream of its mouth, then passes south of the unincorporated village of Elimsport.

White Deer Hole Creek then flows east into Gregg Township in Union County, receiving its major tributary, Spring Creek, on the left bank upstream of its mouth. Spring Creek rises north of Elimsport in Washington Township and flows east-southeast, passing through <a href="Pennsylvania%20State%20Game%20Lands">Pennsylvania State Game Lands</a> No. 252 and just south of the <a href="Federal%20Correctional%20Institute%2C%20Allenwood">Federal Correctional Institute, Allenwood</a>.

The creek next flows just south of the hamlet of Spring Garden, then south of the village of Allenwood, where it has its <a href="confluence%20%28geography%29">confluence</a> with the West Branch Susquehanna River. The direct distance between the source and mouth is only . <a href="U.S.%20Route%2015">U.S. Route 15</a> and the <a href="Union%20County%20Industrial%20Railroad">Union County Industrial Railroad</a> run north-south here along the river and cross the creek just before its mouth; however, this track is not in service as of 2009. <a href="Pennsylvania%20Route%2044">Pennsylvania Route 44</a> runs east-west roughly parallel to the creek between Elimsport and Allenwood. Township roads run along the eastern two-thirds of the creek, and smaller, more primitive roads follow it to its source.
From the mouth of White Deer Hole Creek it is along the West Branch Susquehanna River to its confluence with the <a href="Susquehanna%20River">Susquehanna River</a> at <a href="Northumberland%2C%20Pennsylvania">Northumberland</a>. The elevation at the source is , while the mouth is at an elevation of . The difference in elevation, , divided by the length of the creek of gives the average drop in elevation per unit length of creek or <a href="relief%20ratio">relief ratio</a> of 84.6 feet/mile (16.0 m/km). The <a href="meander">meander ratio</a> is 1.14, so the creek's path is not entirely straight in its bed. The meandering increases near the mouth.

For its entire length, White Deer Hole Creek runs along the north side of South White Deer Ridge, an east-west ridge of the <a href="Appalachian%20Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a>. North White Deer Ridge and <a href="Bald%20Eagle%20Mountain">Bald Eagle Mountain</a> form the northern edge of the creek valley. There are 24 unnamed tributaries on the south side of the creek, all flowing down the side of South White Deer Ridge, while there are only 11 tributaries on the north side, including Spring Creek.

White Deer Creek, the next major creek to the south, flows along the other side of South White Deer Ridge in Union County and is just away (as measured along the West Branch Susquehanna River). The next major creek to the north is <a href="Muncy%20Creek">Muncy Creek</a>, away along the river, but on the opposite bank. The next creek to the north on the same bank (except for the small <a href="Black%20Run%20%28West%20Branch%20Susquehanna%20River%29">Black Run</a>) is <a href="Black%20Hole%20Creek">Black Hole Creek</a>, on the south side of Bald Eagle Mountain. It has a watershed area of and enters the river away at the borough of <a href="Montgomery%2C%20Pennsylvania">Montgomery</a>.

White Deer Hole Creek joins the West Branch Susquehanna River upstream of its mouth.

White Deer Hole Creek is in a sandstone, limestone, and shale mountain region, entirely in the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians. South and North White Deer Ridge and Bald Eagle Mountain are composed of <a href="sedimentary">sedimentary</a> Ordovician rock, while the valley rock is Silurian, with a small Devonian region closer to the river, in the north. The watershed has no deposits of coal, nor natural gas or oil fields. The creek is in a narrow mountain valley with steep slopes in its upper reaches. In its middle and lower reaches it has steep mountain slopes to the south, and a wide valley with rolling hills and gentle slopes to the north. The <a href="stream%20bed">channel</a> pattern is transitional, with a trellised drainage pattern.

From 1961 to 1995, the <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a> (USGS) operated one <a href="stream%20gauge">stream gauge</a> on White Deer Hole Creek at the Gap Road bridge (upstream of Elimsport), for the uppermost of the watershed. The highest yearly peak <a href="discharge%20%28hydrology%29">discharge</a> measured at this site was per second and the highest yearly peak gauge height was , both on June 22, 1972, during <a href="Hurricane%20Agnes">Hurricane Agnes</a>. The lowest yearly peak discharge in this time period was per second and the lowest yearly peak gauge height was , both on November 26, 1986. The USGS also measured discharge at Allenwood, very near the creek's mouth, as part of water quality measurements on seven occasions between 1970 and 1975. The average discharge was per second, and ranged from a high of per second to a low of per second. There are no other known stream gauges on the creek.

The White Deer Hole Creek watershed consists of 0.08 percent of the area of Clinton County, 4.40 percent of the area of Lycoming County, and 3.67 percent of the area of Union County. Neighboring watersheds are the West Branch Susquehanna River and its minor tributaries (north and east), White Deer Creek (south), and <a href="Fishing%20Creek%20%28Bald%20Eagle%20Creek%29">Fishing Creek</a> (west).

In 2000, the White Deer Hole Creek watershed population was 2,672. In the 1970s, Amish began moving to the Elimsport area from <a href="Lancaster%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Lancaster County</a>. In 1995 there were over 200 Amish in more than twenty families. In comparison, Washington Township's population was 1,613 in 2000. Elimsport has Amish harness, machine repair, and food shops, and a new <a href="one-room%20school">one-room school</a> was built nearby in 1997.

The watershed area is , with of forest and for agriculture. By area, 1.1 percent of the watershed lies in Clinton County (in Crawford and <a href="Greene%20Township%2C%20Clinton%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Greene</a> Townships), 81.6 percent lies in Lycoming County (in <a href="Brady%20Township%2C%20Lycoming%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Brady</a>, <a href="Clinton%20Township%2C%20Lycoming%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Clinton</a>, Limestone, and Washington Townships), and 17.3 percent lies in Union County (in Gregg, <a href="Lewis%20Township%2C%20Union%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Lewis</a>, <a href="West%20Buffalo%20Township%2C%20Union%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">West Buffalo</a>, and <a href="White%20Deer%20Township%2C%20Union%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">White Deer</a> Townships).

Spring Creek is the major tributary, draining an area of or 31 percent of the total White Deer Hole Creek watershed. No other tributaries are named and only the area of the tributary in <a href="Beartrap%20Hollow">Beartrap Hollow</a> is known, with or 0.63 percent of the total.

Clearcutting of forests in the early 20th century and the ordnance plant in the Second World War adversely affected the White Deer Hole Creek watershed's ecology and water quality. Agricultural <a href="Surface%20runoff">runoff</a> was and is another potential source of pollution. Gregg Township had no <a href="sewage%20treatment">wastewater treatment plant</a> until an 800,000-gallon/day (304 m/day) plant was built along the river just north of the creek for the federal prison (90 percent) and village of Allenwood (10 percent). The drainage basin has been designated by Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection as "a high quality watershed" since 2001.

The mean annual <a href="Precipitation%20%28meteorology%29">precipitation</a> for White Deer Hole Creek is 40 to 42 inches (1,016 to 1,067 mm). Pennsylvania receives the most <a href="acid%20rain">acid rain</a> of any state in the United States. Because the creek is in a sandstone, limestone, and shale mountain region, it has a relatively low capacity to <a href="Neutralization%20%28chemistry%29">neutralize</a> added acid. This makes it especially vulnerable to acid rain, which poses a threat to the long term health of the plants and animals in the creek. The <a href="Alkalinity">total alkalinity</a> of the "Class A Wild Trout Waters" is 2 for the of White Deer Hole Creek so classified, and 13 for the unnamed tributary in the Fourth Gap.

Edward Gertler writes in "Keystone Canoeing" that White Deer Hole Creek "offers a good springtime beginner cruise through a pretty, agricultural valley" with "many satisfying views" and "good current and many easy riffles". Canoeing and kayaking are possible in spring and after hard rain, with of Class 1 <a href="whitewater">whitewater</a> on the <a href="International%20Scale%20of%20River%20Difficulty">International Scale of River Difficulty</a> from Back Road bridge east to U.S. Route 15 (the mouth). One can start further upstream at the Gap Road bridge, for of Class 2 whitewater, but <a href="Whitewater%23Strainers">strainers</a> are more of a problem here.

White Deer Hole Creek is designated by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission as a "Class A Wild Trout Waters" stream, from the source downstream to the Township Road 384 (Gap Road) bridge. The unnamed tributary in Fourth Gap is also "Class A Wild Trout Waters". The creek downstream from the bridge, as well as Spring Creek, have been designated as approved trout waters by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission and are <a href="Fish%20stocking">stocked</a> with trout and may be fished during trout season. Other fish found in the creek and river include <a href="carp">carp</a>, <a href="catfish">catfish</a>, <a href="Esox">pickerel</a>, and <a href="pike%20%28fish%29">pike</a>.

Hunting, trapping, and fishing are possible with proper licenses in Tiadaghton State Forest and the in State Game Lands No. 252. In 2002, a <a href="Pennsylvania%20Department%20of%20Conservation%20and%20Natural%20Resources">Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources</a> report on "State Forest Waters with Special Protection" rated White Deer Hole Creek from its source to Spring Creek as a "High Quality-Cold Water Fishery". In addition to these public lands, there are private hunting and fishing clubs and cabins along White Deer Hole Creek and its tributaries. Popular game species include <a href="American%20black%20bear">American black bear</a>, <a href="white-tailed%20deer">white-tailed deer</a>, <a href="ruffed%20grouse">ruffed grouse</a>, and <a href="wild%20turkey">wild turkey</a>.

Part of the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Mid%20State%20Trail">Pennsylvania Mid State Trail</a>, marked with orange <a href="Trail%20blazing">blazes</a> to indicate it is solely for hiking, runs along a section of White Deer Hole Creek from west of the Fourth Gap to beyond the source. There are other hiking trails in the watershed, and the Third Gap, Metzger, Mud Hole, Pennsylvania Mid State, Sawalt, and Mountain Gap trails are part of the <a href="Central%20Mountains%20Shared%20Use%20Trails%20System">Central Mountains Shared Use Trails System</a>, marked with red blazes, in Tiadaghton and <a href="Bald%20Eagle%20State%20Forest">Bald Eagle State Forest</a>s in Union, Lycoming, and Clinton Counties.

Roads and trails in the state forest are also open for horseback riding and mountain biking. Some trails are dedicated to cross-country skiing and snowmobiling in winter. The state forest is open for primitive camping, although certain areas require a permit. Small campfires are allowed, except from March to mid-May and October through November, or by order of the district forester, when self-contained stoves are allowed.

The first recorded inhabitants of the Susquehanna River valley were the <a href="Susquehannock">Susquehannock</a>s, an <a href="Iroquoian%20languages">Iroquoian</a> speaking people. Their name meant "people of the muddy river" in the <a href="Algonquian%20languages">Algonquian</a>, but their name for themselves is unknown. Decimated by diseases and warfare, they had largely died out, moved away, or been <a href="cultural%20assimilation">assimilated</a> into other tribes by the early 18th century. The lands of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley were then chiefly occupied by the <a href="Christian%20Munsee">Munsee</a> <a href="phratry">phratry</a> of the <a href="Lenape">Lenape</a> (or "Delaware"), and were under the nominal control of the Five (later Six) Nations of the <a href="Iroquois">Iroquois</a>. Two important paths of these native indigenous peoples ran along parts of White Deer Hole Creek.

The <a href="Great%20Island%20Path">Great Island Path</a> was a major trail that ran north along the Susquehanna River from the <a href="Shamokin%20%28village%29">Saponi village of Shamokin</a> at modern <a href="Sunbury%2C%20Pennsylvania">Sunbury</a>, fording the river there and following the west bank of the West Branch Susquehanna River north until White Deer Hole valley. The path turned west at Allenwood and followed White Deer Hole Creek until about the present location of Elimsport. There it headed northwest, crossed North White Deer Ridge and passed west through the <a href="Nippenose%20Township%2C%20Pennsylvania">Nippenose</a> valley, then turned north and crossed Bald Eagle Mountain via McElhattan Creek and ran along the south bank of the river to the Great Island (near the present day city of <a href="Lock%20Haven%2C%20Pennsylvania">Lock Haven</a>). The stretch from the mouth of the creek to the Nippenose valley is approximately followed by Route 44. From the Great Island, the <a href="Great%20Shamokin%20Path">Great Shamokin Path</a> continued further west to the modern boroughs of <a href="Clearfield%2C%20Pennsylvania">Clearfield</a> and <a href="Kittanning%2C%20Pennsylvania">Kittanning</a>, the last on the <a href="Allegheny%20River">Allegheny River</a>.
<a href="Culbertson%27s%20Path">Culbertson's Path</a> followed White Deer Hole Creek west from Allenwood, then followed Spring Creek north, crossed Bald Eagle Mountain and followed Mosquito Run to the river at the current borough of <a href="Duboistown%2C%20Pennsylvania">Duboistown</a>. Here it crossed the river to "French Margaret's Town" (western modern day <a href="Williamsport%2C%20Pennsylvania">Williamsport</a>) before joining the major <a href="Sheshequin%20Path">Sheshequin Path</a>, which led north up <a href="Lycoming%20Creek">Lycoming Creek</a> to the North Branch of the Susquehanna River, modern <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>, and the Iroquois there. These trails were only wide enough for one person, but settlers in White Deer Hole valley broadened the path to DuBoistown to take grain to Culbertson's mill on Mosquito Run, hence the name. Culbertson's Path was used as a part of the <a href="Underground%20Railroad">Underground Railroad</a> until the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> began in 1861. Escaped slaves would often wade in creeks to hide their scent from pursuing <a href="bloodhound">bloodhound</a>s. In 2009, there is still a "Culbertson's Trail", for hiking over Bald Eagle Mountain from <a href="Pennsylvania%20Route%20554">Pennsylvania Route 554</a> to Duboistown.

When Lycoming County was organized on April 13, 1795, the bill passed by the Pennsylvania legislature defined the new county's boundaries thus:

The borders of the county have changed considerably since, but the White Deer Hole Creek watershed still approximates the county line in the south. Until 1861, what is now Gregg Township in Union County was a part of Brady Township in Lycoming County. Thus, until the start of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, almost all of White Deer Hole Creek and its watershed were part of Lycoming County.

Prior to construction, the site of the wastewater treatment plant yielded archeological evidence of habitation by indigenous peoples from the <a href="Paleo-Indians">Paleo-Indian</a>, <a href="Archaic%20period%20in%20the%20Americas">Archaic</a>, and <a href="Woodland%20period">Woodland period</a>s. The only Native American inhabitant of the valley whose name is known, "Cochnehaw", lived near the mouth of White Deer Hole Creek. White Deer Hole Creek was acquired by the colonial government of Pennsylvania on November 5, 1768, as part of the "<a href="New%20Purchase%20%281768%29">New Purchase</a>" in the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Fort%20Stanwix">Treaty of Fort Stanwix</a>. The first settlers came to the valley in 1769 or 1770, and by 1778 there were 146 landowners on the township tax rolls (though many likely resided elsewhere.)

In the American Revolutionary War, settlements throughout the Susquehanna valley were attacked by <a href="Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Loyalists</a> and Native Americans allied with the British. After the <a href="Battle%20of%20Wyoming">Wyoming Valley battle and massacre</a> in the summer of 1778 (near what is now <a href="Wilkes-Barre%2C%20Pennsylvania">Wilkes-Barre</a>) and smaller local attacks, the "<a href="The%20Big%20Runaway">Big Runaway</a>" occurred throughout the West Branch Susquehanna valley. Settlers fled from feared and actual attacks by the British and their allies. Settlers abandoned their homes and fields, drove their livestock south, and towed their possessions on rafts on the river to <a href="Sunbury%2C%20Pennsylvania">Sunbury</a>. Their abandoned property was burnt by the attackers. Some settlers soon returned, only to flee again in the summer of 1779 in the "Little Runaway".

<a href="Sullivan%27s%20Expedition">Sullivan's Expedition</a> helped stabilize the area and encouraged resettlement, which continued after the war. However, in 1787 there were only fourteen families in the valley: five on the river banks, five on White Deer Hole Creek between Spring Creek and the river, two on Spring Creek, and two on the creek west of Spring Creek. Six families left the area not long after 1787. The first grist mill was built on the creek in 1789, and four more were built in 1798, 1815, 1817, and 1842.

Beginning with the first settlers, much of the land along White Deer Hole Creek was slowly cleared of timber. Small sawmills were constructed in the 19th century, and a much larger lumber operation was run by the Vincent Lumber Company from 1901 to 1904. The company built a <a href="narrow%20gauge%20railway">narrow gauge</a> railroad from Elimsport west into timber, and a line east to Allenwood and the <a href="Reading%20Railroad">Reading Railroad</a> there. The lumber railroad, which ended near the Fourth Gap, ran parallel to the creek. It was incorporated on June 24, 1901, (around the time of construction) as the "Allenwood and Western Railroad". The lumbering operation ceased in 1904 when the forests were gone. The railroad was torn up, and its one second-hand <a href="Shay%20locomotive">Shay locomotive</a> was moved to the Vincent Lumber Company operation at Denholm in <a href="Juniata%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Juniata County</a>.

From 1900 to 1935, much of what is now Tiadaghton State Forest was purchased by Pennsylvania from lumber companies that had no further use for the clear-cut land. In the 1930s there were seven <a href="Civilian%20Conservation%20Corps">Civilian Conservation Corps</a> (CCC) camps to construct roads and trails in the forest. CCC Camp S-125-Pa (Elimsport) was located west of Allenwood along the creek, between the Third and Fourth Gaps.

Small-scale lumbering continues in the watershed, but the forest is certified as well-managed "in an environmentally sensitive manner" and lumber from it qualifies for a "green label". Gertler reports lumber operations along White Deer Hole Creek near Elimsport in the early 1980s. A sawmill owned and operated by Amish is on Route 44 in Elimsport. It burned down on May 10, 2006, causing $500,000 in damages, but was expected to be back in operation in a month; it has since reopened. Despite this small-scale lumbering, as of 2009 the forests have grown back and are mixed <a href="oak">oak</a>, with <a href="blueberry">blueberry</a> and <a href="kalmia%20latifolia">mountain laurel</a> bushes. White Deer Hole Creek and its tributaries also have stands of <a href="tsuga">hemlock</a> and thickets of <a href="rhododendron">rhododendron</a> along them.

During the Second World War, the federal government built the $50 million Susquehanna <a href="Explosive%20material">Ordnance</a> Depot to make TNT on , partially in the White Deer Hole Creek watershed. In the spring of 1942, residents were evicted by <a href="eminent%20domain">eminent domain</a> from 163 farms and 47 other properties in Gregg Township in Union County and Brady, Clinton, and Washington Townships in Lycoming County. The village of Alvira in Gregg Township disappeared. Alvira was founded in 1825 as "Wisetown" and had 100 inhabitants by 1900. Although the inhabitants were told they could return after the war, almost all the buildings seized were razed. Only some cemeteries and the nearby "Stone Church" remain. Construction of the plant involved some 10,000 people, and it took 3,500 to 4,500 employees to run the plant with its more than 200 buildings and 149 storage bunkers for TNT and high explosives, as well as storage racks of bombs. However, the need for TNT was lower than originally estimated and the project was nearly abandoned. By 1945, the only workers left at the depot were guards.
The depot closed after the war and the land was used by the United States Army for testing. In 1950, the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Prisons">Federal Bureau of Prisons</a> was given of the plant site, and began housing prisoners from the <a href="Lewisburg%20Federal%20Penitentiary">Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary</a> there in 1952. In 1957 the "Allenwood Prison Camp" was built, which became the "Federal Correctional Institute, Allenwood". This was greatly expanded in the early 1990s to become "the largest federal prison facility" in the United States. North of the White Deer Hole Creek watershed, some of the land was sold to make the "White Deer Golf Course" in Clinton Township, and in 1973, of prison land in Brady Township were leased to Lycoming County for its landfill (which serves five counties).

The remaining were given to Pennsylvania and became State Game Lands 252. Many of the 149 concrete bunkers remain, but it is "a diverse mix of mature forest, impoundments, and brushy thickets, as well as a local hotspot for a variety of birds during migration". The watershed is a haven for wildlife. Common animals in the game lands include <a href="painted%20turtle">painted</a> and <a href="common%20snapping%20turtle">common snapping turtle</a>s, <a href="muskrat">muskrat</a>s, <a href="frog">frog</a>s, <a href="eastern%20cottontail">eastern cottontail</a>s, <a href="red%20fox">red fox</a>es, and <a href="white-tailed%20deer">white-tailed deer</a>, while birds include <a href="golden-winged%20warbler">golden-winged</a>, <a href="hooded%20warbler">hooded</a>, and <a href="blue-winged%20warbler">blue-winged warbler</a>s, <a href="red-shouldered%20hawk">red-shouldered hawk</a>s, <a href="wood%20duck">wood duck</a>s, <a href="Bewick%27s%20swan">tundra swans</a>, <a href="pied-billed%20grebe">pied-billed grebe</a>s, <a href="American%20bittern">American bittern</a>s, <a href="heron">heron</a>s, and <a href="belted%20kingfisher">belted kingfisher</a>s. The first <a href="barn%20owl">barn owl</a>s to be <a href="bird%20ringing">banded</a> in Lycoming County were in a barn near Elimsport in 2006. <a href="eastern%20gray%20squirrel">Gray squirrels</a>, <a href="groundhog">groundhog</a>s, <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a>s, <a href="crow">crow</a>s, <a href="red-tailed%20hawk">red-tailed hawk</a>s, <a href="downy%20woodpecker">downy woodpecker</a>s, <a href="cardinal%20%28bird%29">cardinals</a>, <a href="blue%20jay">blue jay</a>s, <a href="American%20robin">American robin</a>s, <a href="nuthatch">nuthatch</a>es, <a href="titmouse">titmice</a>, and <a href="sparrow">sparrow</a>s are also found in the White Deer Hole Creek watershed.

Some locals in the surrounding areas often report paranormal sightings and activities in the bunker areas. Many stories and experiences are recurring while others are different. There have been no formal investigations of the activity reported so far, however some people have performed personal investigations and reported their outcomes.

Set in the fictional <a href="Star%20Wars%20galaxy">"Star Wars" galaxy</a> and inspired by the "" comics, the game takes place primarily between events in the films "<a href="Star%20Wars%20%28film%29">Star Wars</a>" and "<a href="The%20Empire%20Strikes%20Back">The Empire Strikes Back</a>". The player controls <a href="Luke%20Skywalker">Luke Skywalker</a>, commander of the elite <a href="X-wing">X-wing</a> pilots known as <a href="Rogue%20Squadron">Rogue Squadron</a>. As the game progresses, Skywalker and Rogue Squadron fight the <a href="Galactic%20Empire%20%28Star%20Wars%29">Galactic Empire</a> in sixteen missions across various planets.

"Rogue Squadron" received generally positive reviews. Critics praised the game's technical achievements and flight controls, but its use of <a href="distance%20fog">distance fog</a> and the lack of a multiplayer mode drew criticism. The game's sales exceeded expectations; by August 1999, more than one million copies had sold worldwide. It spawned two sequels developed and released for the <a href="GameCube">GameCube</a>—"" and ""—as well as "", a <a href="spiritual%20successor">spiritual successor</a> released for Windows and Nintendo 64.

Unlike the that emphasizes <a href="Space%20combat%20simulator">space combat simulation</a>, "Rogue Squadron" is a fast-paced, <a href="Arcade%20genre">arcade-style</a> <a href="action%20game">action game</a>. Each of the game's sixteen levels introduces mission objectives that must be completed to progress to the next level. These objectives are divided into four categories: search and destroy, reconnaissance, rescue, and protect. Enemy aircraft are primarily composed of <a href="TIE%20fighter">TIE fighter</a>s. Ground defenses are more varied and include three different <a href="Walker%20%28Star%20Wars%29">walkers</a>, laser and <a href="missile%20turret">missile turret</a>s, tanks, probe droids, shuttles, <a href="Stormtrooper%20%28Star%20Wars%29">stormtrooper</a>s and <a href="speeder%20bike">speeder bike</a>s.

The <a href="HUD%20%28video%20gaming%29">heads-up display</a> features a <a href="Health%20%28gaming%29">health meter</a>, a <a href="radar">radar</a> and an ammunition count for secondary weapons. The player can control five craft: <a href="X-wing">X-wing</a>, <a href="A-wing">A-wing</a>, <a href="Y-wing">Y-wing</a>, <a href="snowspeeder">snowspeeder</a> and <a href="V-wing%20airspeeder">V-wing</a>. Each vehicle offers a unique armament arrangement, as well as varying degrees of speed and maneuverability. The game initially restricts the player to a particular craft for each level; however, after a level is completed, it can be replayed with any available craft. Levels set on non-atmospheric moons expose the player's craft to space; thus disallowing the Speeder and V-Wing (which are repulsorcraft) from being used; but as on other levels, the craft is vertically confined. Nine bonus power-ups are hidden in different levels throughout the game. These bonuses improve a craft's weapons or durability and are applied to each eligible craft for the remainder of the game.

The player's performance is measured throughout the game, and performance statistics are checked after each level against three medal benchmarks. Each benchmark contains five categories: completion time, number of enemies destroyed, shot accuracy, number of friendly craft and structures saved and number of bonuses collected. If a player's performance exceeds one of the level's three benchmarks in all five categories, a medal—bronze, silver or gold—is awarded on completion. Acquiring these medals promotes the player's rank and helps unlock hidden content.

"Rogue Squadron" includes a number of unlockable secrets. The player can unlock three bonus levels: "Beggar's Canyon", "The Death Star Trench Run" and "The Battle of Hoth". These levels are made available when the player obtains all bronze, silver or gold medals, respectively, on each level. Alternatively, they can be unlocked via <a href="Cheat%20code">passcode</a>. Unlike the game's primary levels, the bonus levels are adaptions of events from the "Star Wars" films. "Beggar's Canyon" allows the player to reenact the race mentioned in "", while "The Death Star Trench Run" allows the player to execute an alternate version of the movie's climactic battle. In the "Battle of Hoth" bonus level, the player can join the <a href="Rebel%20Alliance">Rebel Alliance</a>'s combat against Imperial troops, as depicted in "<a href="The%20Empire%20Strikes%20Back">The Empire Strikes Back</a>".

Several craft are also available when unlocked. Both the "<a href="Millennium%20Falcon">Millennium Falcon</a>" and a <a href="TIE%20interceptor">TIE interceptor</a> are initially present in the craft selection screen. However, neither may be selected until the player enters the correct passcodes or achieves all bronze or silver medals, respectively, on the bonus levels. Two other craft can be unlocked, but each is confined to a specific level. One is the <a href="T-16%20Skyhopper">T-16 Skyhopper</a> in "Beggar's Canyon", and an <a href="AT-ST">AT-ST</a> is playable in a basic demonstration level unlocked only via passcode. A playable model of a 1969 <a href="Buick%20Electra">Buick Electra 225</a> based on a car owned by the game's sound designer, Rudolph Stember, is also included in the game as an <a href="easter%20egg%20%28media%29">Easter egg</a>.

During "Rogue Squadron" development, ""—the first new "Star Wars" film in more than 15 years—was less than one year from its scheduled release date. To take advantage of this marketing opportunity, <a href="Factor%205">Factor 5</a> included content from the upcoming film in "Rogue Squadron". <a href="LucasFilm">LucasFilm</a> provided the developers with design art for the <a href="Naboo%20Starfighter">Naboo Starfighter</a>, a ship prominently featured in the new film. These designs were used to create an in-game model. Because the game was scheduled to be released six months before the film, Factor 5 was required to keep the ship's inclusion a secret. As a result, most of the game's development team at Factor 5 and <a href="LucasArts">LucasArts</a> were not informed of its inclusion. A complex scrambling system was also developed to help hide the ship's code from gamers using <a href="cheat%20cartridge">cheat cartridge</a>s such as <a href="GameShark">GameShark</a> or <a href="Action%20Replay">Action Replay</a>. More than six months after the release of "Rogue Squadron", LucasArts unveiled the code to unlock the Naboo Starfighter as a playable craft. The code has been named the <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a>'s most well-hidden code because of the length of time before its discovery.

"Star Wars: Rogue Squadron" is set in the fictional <a href="Star%20Wars%20galaxy">"Star Wars" galaxy</a>, where a war is fought between the <a href="Galactic%20Empire%20%28Star%20Wars%29">Galactic Empire</a> and the Rebel Alliance. The game's first fifteen levels occur six months after the Battle of <a href="Yavin">Yavin</a>—as depicted in "A New Hope"—and before the events of "The Empire Strikes Back". As the Empire gathers strength for an all-out assault on the rebel forces, <a href="Luke%20Skywalker">Luke Skywalker</a> and <a href="Wedge%20Antilles">Wedge Antilles</a> form <a href="Rogue%20Squadron">Rogue Squadron</a>, a group comprising twelve of the most skilled X-wing pilots from the Rebel Alliance.

The sixteenth and final level of the game takes place during "<a href="Dark%20Empire">Dark Empire</a>", six years after ""'s Battle of <a href="Endor%20%28Star%20Wars%29">Endor</a>. The Rebel Alliance has established the <a href="New%20Republic%20%28Star%20Wars%29">New Republic</a>, which now controls three quarters of the galaxy. After the deaths of <a href="Palpatine">Emperor Palpatine</a> and <a href="Darth%20Vader">Darth Vader</a>, the Galactic Empire collapsed, but was reborn under a mysterious new leader (who is actually a clone of Palpatine). Rogue Squadron, now under the command of Wedge Antilles, continues to fight the Empire to protect the newly formed Republic.

The story is divided into four chapters, each of which starts with an <a href="Star%20Wars%20opening%20crawl">opening crawl</a> resembling those featured in the "<a href="Star%20Wars">Star Wars</a>" films. Further story details are presented through the game's instruction manual, pre-mission briefings, character conversations during the game and in-game <a href="cut%20scene">cut scene</a>s. The game begins with Rogue Squadron briefly encountering the Empire at the <a href="Mos%20Eisley">Mos Eisley</a> spaceport on <a href="Tatooine">Tatooine</a>. The team then executes escort and rescue missions on Barkhesh and Chorax, respectively.

The Rebels learn that Imperial officer <a href="List%20of%20Star%20Wars%20characters%23M">Crix Madine</a> wishes to defect to the Rebel Alliance. The Empire launches an attack on <a href="Corellia">Corellia</a>, where Madine is stationed, to prevent his departure. Rogue Squadron, with the help of <a href="Han%20Solo">Han Solo</a> and <a href="Chewbacca">Chewbacca</a> in the "Millennium Falcon", fights off the Empire and helps escort Madine safely off the planet. Soon after, Rogue Squadron is joined by Gold Squadron, a group of Y-wings now led by Crix Madine; they are dispatched to the moon of Gerrard V to aid its quest for independence from the Empire. They encounter the 128th TIE interceptor Squadron and disable <a href="List%20of%20Star%20Wars%20characters%23M">Kasan Moor</a>'s TIE. When Rogue Squadron tells Moor that she has been taken prisoner, she offers to defect and provide the Rebel Alliance with Imperial intelligence.

With the help of Kasan Moor's intelligence, the Alliance launches three consecutive attacks on Imperial bases throughout the galaxy. After an assault on the Imperial Enclave, a facility on Kile II supporting the Empire's Naval operations, Wedge Antilles is ambushed by a group of TIEs and is taken captive. The Rebel Alliance tracks Wedge to an Imperial prison complex on the planet of <a href="Kessel%20%28Star%20Wars%29">Kessel</a>. The remaining members of Rogue Squadron travel to Kessel and rescue him and other Rebel prisoners.

With Wedge Antilles free and Rogue Squadron again at full strength, the Rebel Alliance turns its attention to a new Imperial threat — <a href="List%20of%20Star%20Wars%20characters%23S">Moff Kohl Seerdon</a>. Seerdon is consolidating Imperial power in preparation for an attack aimed at capturing <a href="Thyferra">Thyferra</a>, a planet which produces the healing substance bacta. Rogue Squadron is ordered to disrupt his operation with hit-and-run missions against key targets on Taloraan and Fest. In retaliation, Seerdon attacks and holds a city on the planet of <a href="Chandrila">Chandrila</a> hostage. Rogue Squadron and the Alliance strike back by initiating a Kasan Moor-engineered raid on an Imperial base located inside a volcano on <a href="Sullust">Sullust</a>. While still on Sullust, however, <a href="List%20of%20Star%20Wars%20characters%23R">General Rieekan</a> informs the Squadron that Moff Seerdon has used their raid as a diversion and begun his attack on Thyferra. With Seerdon in control of the planet's bacta and their own supply threatened, Rogue Squadron quickly reaches Thyferra, kills Seerdon and frees the planet.

In the final chapter, the game moves into the future, six years after the Battle of Endor. Rogue Squadron, now under the command of Wedge Antilles, continues to fight the wounded Empire. On the planet of <a href="Mon%20Calamari%20%28fictional%20planet%29">Mon Calamari</a>, new Imperial weapons called <a href="List%20of%20Star%20Wars%20air%2C%20aquatic%2C%20and%20ground%20vehicles%23World%20Devastator">World Devastator</a>s are destroying the planet. Rogue Squadron is deployed, disables all three Devastators and destroys the Imperial presence.

After the success of "" on the Nintendo 64 in 1996, LucasArts began planning a follow-up. At the time, Factor 5 was developing a game engine to create large terrain maps. LucasArts, pleased with earlier collaborations with the company, decided to use Factor 5's engine for its new game. The game's focus would be space combat; this direction was inspired by a level of "Shadows of the Empire" in which the player flies a snowspeeder during the Battle of <a href="Hoth">Hoth</a>. "Rogue Squadron" and Factor 5 production manager Brett Tosti stated, "That whole scene was actually the genesis for Rogue Squadron because everybody said, 'Why don't you do a whole game like that?' So we did." Factor 5 initially pitched a concept to allow gamers to play through missions similar to the fans' favorite action sequences from the "Star Wars" films. This proposal was rejected, however. At that time, LucasFilm was not comfortable with video games drawing directly from the films.

During the early stages of development, the designers at LucasArts were inspired by "<a href="Rogue%20Squadron%20%28novel%29">Rogue Squadron</a>" and later "", a series of books and comic books set during the years of the original film trilogy. They began developing the story and gameplay with a similar setting that would include characters from the films participating in new, original missions using Factor 5's terrain map engine as the base. In May 1998, a demo of the game was displayed at <a href="E3%20%28Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo%29">E3</a>, but the game was so incomplete at the time that Tosti considered it a <a href="tech%20demo">tech demo</a>. It rendered a basic <a href="heightmap">heightmap</a> and an immobile <a href="AT-AT">AT-AT</a> model, while TIE fighters lacking <a href="game%20artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> flew and fired in a predetermined path. When "playing" the demo for audiences, Tosti followed a very specific flight path of his own to give the illusion that he was actually battling with the TIEs. Despite the demo's barebones presentation, response from gamers was largely positive.

Factor 5 appealed to Nintendo to use the Nintendo 64's newly developed memory <a href="Expansion%20Pak">Expansion Pak</a>. Nintendo was reluctant, expecting the technology to be reserved solely for hardware peripherals. However, after <a href="Iguana%20Entertainment">Iguana Entertainment</a> used the Expansion Pak to achieve a higher display resolution for "", Factor 5 was given the green light. The Expansion Pak is used to increase "Rogue Squadron"'s N64 resolution from 320 × 240 to 640 × 480.

LucasFilm was hesitant to grant access to the "Star Wars" library of sound effects for the game's sound designer, Rudolph Stember. As a compromise, the company provided Stember with sounds <a href="Sampling%20rate">sample</a>d at the relatively low rate of 22 kHz, half the standard rate. Stember objected, claiming that the clips sounded worse than effects he had lifted from <a href="VHS">VHS</a> tapes for a previous "Star Wars" project. The game includes <a href="Voice%20acting">voice work</a> from several notable persons, including screen actors <a href="Olivia%20Hussey">Olivia Hussey</a> and <a href="Raphael%20Sbarge">Raphael Sbarge</a> as well as voice actors <a href="Bob%20Bergen">Bob Bergen</a>, <a href="Neil%20Ross">Neil Ross</a> and <a href="Terence%20McGovern">Terence McGovern</a>. Instead of using Nintendo's default sound drivers, Factor 5 developed its own tool called MOsys FX Surround. The Factor 5 drivers use Nintendo 64 processors, but tax them less; advanced compression techniques were also employed. As a result, the game includes over 80 minutes of high-quality stereo sound.

In November 1998, a month before the game's scheduled release, LucasArts signed a worldwide agreement with Nintendo concerning three new "Star Wars" video games. It granted Nintendo the rights to market the games and hold exclusive, worldwide distribution rights for five years following each release. "Rogue Squadron" was the first game released under this agreement.

To promote the release of the game, <a href="Mark%20Hamill">Mark Hamill</a>, the actor who played Luke Skywalker, visited the <a href="Ronald%20Reagan%20UCLA%20Medical%20Center%23Mattel%20Children%27s%20Hospital%20UCLA">Mattel Children's Hospital</a> in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> to play the game with patients using newly added <a href="Starlight%20Fun%20Center">Starlight Fun Center</a>s.

Many reviews compared "Star Wars: Rogue Squadron" to one of its inspirations, the Battle of Hoth flight combat level in "Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire", considered one of that game's best elements. "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" remarked that "Rogue Squadron" "enhanced the flight model with true pitch, roll, and bank mechanics". <a href="IGN">IGN</a> praised its inclusion of "upgrades, more enemies, better sound, and stunning second-generation graphics". The Nintendo 64 version received mostly positive reviews, and received an aggregate score of 85 percent from both <a href="GameRankings">GameRankings</a> and <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>. "GamePro" named it one of the best games released in 1998. In a 2008 retrospective, IGN's Levi Buchanan stated that the game revived the "Star Wars" license on consoles through well-paced gameplay, a story tied into the <a href="Star%20Wars%20canon">"Star Wars" canon</a> and visuals that made it "one of the generation's top stunners".

The game's technical aspects were singled out for acclaim. Its visuals were called "respectable" in the standard resolution, but highly praised in high-resolution mode (achieved via the Nintendo 64's Expansion Pak). <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> remarked that in a higher resolution, "[the] textures of the landscapes, the ships, the lighting effects—everything looks so much better," while IGN's <a href="Peer%20Schneider">Peer Schneider</a> said, "After playing the game in the optional high resolution mode (640 × 480) once, it's impossible to go back to the still respectable standard resolution." Citing details such as decals, Rebel markings, <a href="Astromech%20droid">R2 unit</a>s, cockpit views and exhaust flames, Schneider described the game's 3D ship models as "gorgeous". IGN's <a href="Matt%20Casamassina">Matt Casamassina</a> said that the game was the best-looking Nintendo 64 game to date.

Reviewers also praised the game's sound design. Powered by the new Factor 5 audio drivers, "Rogue Squadron" features about 40 minutes of speech and 40 minutes of music. GameSpot's Ryan Mac Donald believed that the game's inclusion of extended voice work helped create a "movie-like" atmosphere. IGN noted that in addition to being technically impressive, the game's <a href="Dolby%20Pro%20Logic">Dolby Pro Logic</a> surround sound was an important gameplay element. The audio signals helped players determine enemy positions and direction of travel. IGN awarded the game three sound awards, including Sound Effects, Best Voice and Best Overall Sound of 1998 on the Nintendo 64.

Some reviewers complained about aspects of the game's visuals; critics disliked the heavy reliance on <a href="distance%20fog">distance fog</a>. Another common criticism of the game was the lack of multiplayer modes. "GamePro" review called the omission a "serious, unforgivable sin"; Schneider believed that while adding these modes would have extended "Rogue Squadron" replay value, the game was still enjoyable for its medal reward system and large number of secrets and unlockables.

Although nearly identical, the game's PC version garnered lower review scores than its Nintendo 64 counterpart, with an aggregated GameRankings score of 80 percent. This version enjoyed many of the same praises for its gameplay, but handling and graphics were cited as problematic. Directly comparing the two versions, <a href="AllGame">AllGame</a>'s Brad Cook wrote that PC version's handling is more difficult than the N64 version. He believed the PC's "choppy" feel made it difficult to target enemies. In contrast to its opinion of the N64 version, IGN's PC review was not enthusiastic about the game's visuals. IGN staff remarked that "Rogue Squadron"s "graphics and special effects aren't spectacular" and that they had "seen better graphics" on the PC.

When "Rogue Squadron" was released in early December 1998, the title's Nintendo 64 incarnation was the second-highest-selling video game for the first half of the month (behind Nintendo's "") and the <a href="Christmas%20and%20holiday%20season">holiday season</a>. <a href="PC%20Data">PC Data</a>, which tracked sales in the United States, reported that "Rogue Squadron" sold 584,337 units and earned $29.3 million in revenue by the end of 1998. This made it the country's ninth-best-selling Nintendo 64 release of the year. Delayed until after Christmas in the United Kingdom, the game was released mid-January and debuted as the second-best-selling game of the month, ahead of "Ocarina of Time". In August 1999, Nintendo added the title to its best-selling <a href="Player%27s%20Choice">Player's Choice</a> collection, while the PC version was re-released as a part of the <a href="LucasArts%20Archives">"LucasArts Archive" Series</a> in May 2001. "Rogue Squadron"'s retail success was not anticipated by the game's producer <a href="Julian%20Eggebrecht">Julian Eggebrecht</a>, who said that the game sold "about 100 times better than anybody expected". The Nintendo 64 version sold over 1 million copies in the United States, and over 44,000 in Japan.

Banksia brownii

Banksia brownii, commonly known as feather-leaved banksia or Brown's banksia, is a <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="shrub">shrub</a> that grows in <a href="Southwest%20Australia">southwest</a> <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>. An attractive plant with fine feathery <a href="leaf">leaves</a> and large red-brown flower spikes, it usually grows as an upright bush around two metres (7 ft) high, but can also occur as a small tree or a low spreading shrub. First collected in 1829 and published the following year, it is placed in "<a href="Banksia">Banksia</a>" <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">subgenus "Banksia"</a>, <a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Oncostylis">section "Oncostylis"</a>, <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Spicigerae">series "Spicigerae"</a>. There are two genetically distinct forms.

"B. brownii" occurs naturally only in two population clusters between <a href="Albany%2C%20Western%20Australia">Albany</a> and the <a href="Stirling%20Range">Stirling Range</a> in southwest Western Australia. In the Stirling Range it occurs among <a href="Heath%20%28habitat%29">heath</a> on rocky mountain slopes; further south it occurs among <a href="jarrah">jarrah</a> <a href="woodland">woodland</a> in shallow nutrient-poor sand. It is <a href="rare%20species">rare</a> and <a href="endangered%20species">endangered</a> in its natural <a href="habitat%20%28ecology%29">habitat</a>, with all major populations currently threatened by <a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">"Phytophthora cinnamomi" dieback</a>, a disease to which the species is highly susceptible. Other threats include loss of habitat, commercial exploitation and changes to the fire regime.

Highly valued by <a href="Australia">Australia</a>'s <a href="horticulture">horticultural</a> and <a href="floristry">cut flower</a> industries, "B. brownii" is widely cultivated in areas not exposed to dieback. It prefers a sheltered position in soil with good drainage, and must be provided with some moisture over summer.

"B. brownii" usually grows as an upright bush between one and three metres (3–10 ft) high, but it can also grow as an openly branched small tree to six metres (20 ft) in sheltered <a href="gully">gullies</a>, or as a low, spreading shrub in exposed locations such as the peaks of the Stirling Range. The bark is a grey-brown colour, smooth and thin, with <a href="lenticel">lenticel</a>s. The leaves are long and thin, from three to ten centimetres (1–5 in) long, and five to ten millimetres (– in) wide. Dark green and hairless above but with a hairy white underside, they are easily recognised by their feather-like appearance, caused by the fact that they are finely divided almost back to the <a href="midrib">midrib</a>, into as many as 70 thin tapered lobes.

Flowers occur in typical "Banksia" "flower spikes", <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s made up of hundreds of pairs of flowers densely packed in a <a href="helix">spiral</a> around a woody axis. "B. brownii"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s flower spike is a metallic red-brown colour, roughly cylindrical, 6 to 19 centimetres (2–7½ in) high and eight to ten centimetres (3–4 in) wide. Each flower consists of a tubular <a href="perianth">perianth</a> made up of four united <a href="tepal">tepal</a>s, and one long wiry <a href="carpel">style</a>. Perianths are cream at the base and grey-brown at the end. Styles are rusty red-brown with a cream tip, and downwardly hooked rather than straight. The style end is initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but breaks free at <a href="anthesis">anthesis</a>.

Flower spikes are held erect and are typically terminal on a branch; often other branchlets grow up and around a spike from below. The fruiting structure is a stout woody "cone", around five centimetres (2 inches) in diameter, with a hairy appearance caused by the persistence of old withered flower parts. A "cone" may be embedded with up to 60 <a href="follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a>, although usually there are very few or even none at all. Unusually for "Banksia", each follicle contains just one seed. This is shiny black, <a href="oval%20%28geometry%29">oval</a> in shape, about 20 millimetres (¾ in) long, with a brown papery wing.

"Banksia brownii" was first collected near <a href="King%20George%20Sound">King George Sound</a> in 1829 by <a href="William%20Baxter%20%28botanist%29">William Baxter</a>, who named it in honour of botanist <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28botanist%2C%20born%201773%29">Robert Brown</a>. A formal description was published by Brown in his 1830 "<a href="Supplementum%20Primum%20Prodromi%20Florae%20Novae%20Hollandiae">Supplementum Primum Prodromi Florae Novae Hollandiae</a>"; thus the full <a href="botanic%20name">botanic name</a> of the species is "Banksia brownii" Baxter ex R.Br. Under <a href="Brown%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">Brown's taxonomic arrangement</a>, "B. brownii" was placed in subgenus "<a href="Banksia%20verae">Banksia verae</a>", the "true banksias", because its inflorescence is a typical "Banksia" flower spike. "Banksia verae" was renamed "<a href="Eubanksia">Eubanksia</a>" by <a href="Stephan%20Ladislaus%20Endlicher">Stephan Endlicher</a> in 1847.

<a href="Carl%20Meissner">Carl Meissner</a> demoted "Eubanksia" to sectional rank in <a href="Meissner%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">his 1856 classification</a>, and divided it into four series, with "B. brownii" placed in series "<a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Dryandroideae">Dryandroideae</a>". When <a href="George%20Bentham">George Bentham</a> published <a href="Bentham%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">his 1870 arrangement</a> in "<a href="Flora%20Australiensis">Flora Australiensis</a>", he discarded Meissner's series, placing all the species with hooked styles together in a section that he named "<a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Oncostylis">Oncostylis</a>". This arrangement would stand for over a century.

In 1891, <a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a> challenged the generic name "Banksia" <a href="Carolus%20Linnaeus%20the%20Younger">L.f.</a>, on the grounds that the name "Banksia" had previously been published in 1775 as "Banksia" <a href="Johann%20Reinhold%20Forster">J.R.Forst</a> & <a href="Georg%20Forster">G.Forst</a>, referring to the genus now known as "<a href="Pimelea">Pimelea</a>". Kuntze proposed "Sirmuellera" as an alternative, republishing "B. brownii" as ""Sirmuellera brownei" (Baxter)" [sic]. The challenge failed, "Banksia" L.f. was formally conserved, and "Sirmuellera brownii" (Baxter ex R.Br.) Kuntze" is now a <a href="synonym%20%28botany%29">nomenclatural synonym</a> of "B. brownii".

<a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a> published a new taxonomic arrangement of "Banksia" in his landmark 1981 monograph "<a href="The%20genus%20Banksia%20L.f.%20%28Proteaceae%29">The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)</a>". Endlicher's "Eubanksia" became <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">"B." subg. "Banksia"</a>, and was divided into three sections, one of which was "Oncostylis". "Oncostylis" was further divided into four series, with "B. brownii" placed in series <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Spicigerae">"Spicigerae"</a> because its inflorescences are cylindrical.

In 1996, <a href="Kevin%20Thiele">Kevin Thiele</a> and <a href="Pauline%20Ladiges">Pauline Ladiges</a> published a new arrangement for the genus, after <a href="cladistics">cladistic</a> analyses yielded a <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> significantly different from George's arrangement. <a href="Thiele%20and%20Ladiges%27%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement</a> retained "B. brownii" in series "Spicigerae", placing it in "B." subser. "Occidentales" along with "<a href="Banksia%20occidentalis">B. occidentalis</a>" (red swamp banksia), "<a href="Banksia%20seminuda">B. seminuda</a>" (river banksia), "<a href="Banksia%20verticillata">B. verticillata</a>" (granite banksia) and "<a href="Banksia%20littoralis">B. littoralis</a>" (swamp banksia). This arrangement stood until 1999, when George effectively reverted to his 1981 arrangement in his monograph for the "<a href="Flora%20of%20Australia%20%28series%29">Flora of Australia</a>" series.

Under <a href="George%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">George's taxonomic arrangement of "Banksia"</a>, "B. brownii"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s taxonomic placement may be summarised as follows:
"B. brownii"s closest relative is held to be "B. occidentalis", which differs from "B. brownii" in having smaller, deep red flowers and narrow, sparsely serrate leaves.

Since 1998, <a href="Austin%20Mast">Austin Mast</a> has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> data for the subtribe <a href="Banksiinae">Banksiinae</a>, which comprises "Banksia" and "<a href="Dryandra">Dryandra</a>". With respect to "B. brownii", Mast's results are somewhat at odds with those of both George and Thiele and Ladiges, finding it to be more closely related to "<a href="Banksia%20nutans">B. nutans</a>" (nodding banksia) and "<a href="Banksia%20quercifolia">B. quercifolia</a>" (oak-leaved banksia) than to many of the "Spicigerae". Overall, the inferred <a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a> is very greatly different from George's arrangement, and provides compelling evidence for the <a href="paraphyly">paraphyly</a> of "Banksia" with respect to "Dryandra". Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement of "Banksia" by transferring "Dryandra" into it, and publishing <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Spathulatae">"B." subg. "Spathulatae"</a> for the species having spoon-shaped <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>s. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of "Dryandra" was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then "B. brownii" is placed in "B." subg. "Spathulatae".

Three genetically distinct forms of "B. brownii" are recognised: the better known forms are a "mountain form" with a shrubby habit, short thin hard leaves, and a squat inflorescence; and a "Millbrook Road form", with a tree habit and longer, wider, soft leaves. Some horticulturists also recognise an intermediate form. Recent genetic testing has confirmed the existence of three distinct forms, but currently these have no taxonomic status.

"B. brownii" occurs between <a href="Albany%2C%20Western%20Australia">Albany</a> (35°S) and the <a href="Stirling%20Range">Stirling Range</a> (34°24'S) in the <a href="Southwest%20Australia">southwest</a> of Western Australia, at the juncture of the <a href="Esperance%20Plains">Esperance Plains</a>, <a href="Warren%20%28biogeographic%20region%29">Warren</a> and <a href="Jarrah%20Forest">Jarrah Forest</a> <a href="biogeography">biogeographic</a> regions. This is the taxonomically richest area for "Banksia", with 19 species, of which six are <a href="endemic%20%28ecology%29">endemic</a>, including "B. brownii" itself. It is cool and wet, with temperatures between four and 30 °C (39–86 °F) and rainfall of around 800 millimetres (31 in). The species occurs there in two distinct population clusters: southern populations occur among low woodland of "<a href="Eucalyptus%20marginata">Eucalyptus marginata</a>" (jarrah) in shallow, nutrient-poor white or grey sand over <a href="laterite">laterite</a>; Stirling Range populations occur at altitudes of between 500 and 1100 metres (1640–3960 ft), among <a href="heath%20%28habitat%29">heath</a> on rocky mountain slopes and tops, and in <a href="shale">shale</a> in gullies.

There are 27 known populations within this region, but only nine of these populations contain more than 10 individual plants, and only five populations have more than 100. Ten populations are now presumed extinct. The total number of plants is estimated at around 1000.

Coastal plants begin to flower at around five years from seed, but plants in the Stirling Range take much longer to mature. In one Stirling Range population, only 15% of plants had flowered after eight years. Flowering time is highly variable, but in general it occurs between March and August, with a peak around June. More flowers open during the day than at night.

As with other "Banksia" species, "B. brownii" is a heavy producer of <a href="nectar%20%28plant%29">nectar</a>, and serves as a food source for a range of nectariferous birds, mammals and insects. Honeyeaters such as "<a href="Phylidonyris%20novaehollandiae">Phylidonyris novaehollandiae</a>" (New Holland honeyeater), "<a href="Acanthorhynchus%20superciliosus">Acanthorhynchus superciliosus</a>" (western spinebill) and "<a href="Anthochaera%20carunculata">Anthochaera carunculata</a>" (red wattlebird) are frequent visitors that often carry heavy <a href="pollen">pollen</a> loads, making them important pollinators. Nocturnal mammals such as "<a href="Rattus%20fuscipes">Rattus fuscipes</a>" (bush rat) and "<a href="Tarsipes%20rostratus">Tarsipes rostratus</a>" (honey possum) also carry heavy pollen loads, but the foraging behaviour of bush rats suggests that these may transfer pollen only over very short distances. Invertebrate visitors include the introduced "<a href="Apis%20mellifera">Apis mellifera</a>" (western honeybee), <a href="Stingless%20bee%23Stingless%20bees%20of%20Australia">native bees</a>, <a href="fly">flies</a> and <a href="ant">ant</a>s; bees appear to be effective pollinators, but ants and flies forage only at the base of flowers and do not come in contact with plant pollen.

The species is partly <a href="self-pollination">self-compatible</a>, as some seed is set when pollinators are excluded. Selection against self-pollinated seed has been observed, but the species has nonetheless been shown to have one of the lowest <a href="outcrossing">outcrossing</a> rates of any "Banksia". This is probably caused by the small population sizes, which increase the probability of self-fertilisation, and may discourage visits by pollinators.

It has a low rate of fruiting, with less than 1% of flowers developing into follicles, and more than half of the inflorescences failing to form any follicles at all. Seed survival rates are similarly low. More than half of a plant's seed crop may be lost to the <a href="larva">larva</a>e of <a href="moth">moth</a>s and <a href="weevil">weevil</a>s, which burrow into the cobs to eat the seeds and <a href="pupa">pupa</a>te in the follicles; and further seed losses are caused by <a href="granivore">granivorous</a> birds such as <a href="cockatoo">cockatoo</a>s, which break off the cobs to eat both the seeds and the insect larvae.

A small proportion of follicles open and release their seed spontaneously, but most remain closed until stimulated to open by <a href="bushfire">bushfire</a>. Bushfire kills the maternal plant, which has neither thick bark nor <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a>s, but the subsequent shedding of seed allows the population to regenerate. Seed predation continues after its release: in one study, "B. brownii" seeds were placed on the ground in both burnt and unburnt sides; almost all were eaten by parrots within four weeks.

Threats to "B. brownii" include loss of habitat due to land clearing, commercial exploitation, disease, and changes to the fire regime. The fragmentation of populations is also of concern, as it causes the genetic diversity of the species to decline, potentially reducing <a href="heterosis">vigour</a>. <a href="Climate%20change">Climate change</a> is also of concern: depending on the severity of change, the range of this species is predicted to contract by 30% to 50% by 2080.

"B. brownii" has been assessed as having a very high risk of extinction. It is estimated that without protective measures in place, it would be extinct within a decade; and that extinction would be "not only a tragedy in itself but may have unforeseen, and potentially disastrous, consequences for the functioning of the vegetation communities of which feather-leaved banksia is an integral part." The species has not yet been formally assessed for the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>, but warrants a "Critically Endangered (CR)" ranking because populations are projected to decline by more than 80% within the next three generations. It is currently listed as "<a href="List%20of%20endangered%20Australian%20plants">Endangered</a>" under Australia's <a href="Environment%20Protection%20and%20Biodiversity%20Conservation%20Act%201999">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</a> (EPBC Act), and "Rare" under Western Australia's <a href="Wildlife%20Conservation%20Act%201950">Wildlife Conservation Act 1950</a>. These <a href="statute">acts</a> provide legislative protection against a range of potential threats, including commercial harvesting of flowers and land clearing. Further statutory protection is afforded by the fact that populations occur within the <a href="Eastern%20Stirling%20Range%20Montane%20Heath%20and%20Thicket">Eastern Stirling Range Montane Heath and Thicket</a> <a href="threatened%20ecological%20community">threatened ecological community</a>, which is listed as "Endangered" under the EPBC Act, and the <a href="Montane%20Mallee%20Thicket%20of%20the%20Stirling%20Range">Montane Mallee Thicket of the Stirling Range</a> threatened ecology community, which has been assessed as "Endangered" by the Western Australian government; and by the presence of northern population within the <a href="Stirling%20Range%20National%20Park">Stirling Range National Park</a>.

A five-year interim management plan was put in place by the Western Australia's Department of Environment and Conservation in October 2005. Actions under that plan include regular monitoring of populations, management of the threats of fire and "P. cinnamomi", and the cold storage of seed. As of December 2009 a recovery plan is being developed. There is also a translocation project underway.

The main threat to "B. brownii" is dieback caused by the <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> plant <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a> "P. cinnamomi", a soil-borne <a href="water%20mould">water mould</a> that causes root rot. Studies of the effect of "P. cinnamomi" on "B. brownii" have found it to be "highly susceptible" to dieback, with specimens "frequently and consistently killed in the wild". As of 2007, all major populations of "B. brownii", and all but one minor population, are suffering from dieback. Moreover, all populations are in an area vulnerable to dieback, so even the uninfected population is considered under threat. According to <a href="Byron%20Lamont">Byron Lamont</a>, "the demise of this species in the wild appears imminent."

A number of protective measures have been implemented, including site access restrictions, the collection and cold-storage of seed, and the treatment of plants with <a href="phosphite">phosphite</a>. Phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct <a href="fungicide">fungicide</a>. Aerial spraying of phosphite boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed as studies have shown that <a href="foliar%20spraying">foliar spraying</a> of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth. Direct injection of phosphite into the <a href="Plant%20stem">stem</a> of each tree appears to lack this disadvantage, but is costly to administer and restricted to known plants.

Other diseases to which "B. brownii" is vulnerable include the parasitic fungus "<a href="Armillaria%20luteobubalina">Armillaria luteobubalina</a>" and the aerial <a href="canker">canker</a> <a href="fungus">fungus</a> "<a href="Zythiostroma">Zythiostroma</a>".

Because "B. brownii" releases its seed in response to bushfire, it is important that fires occur at intervals that allow the plants to generate plenty of viable seed. The optimum fire interval is around 18 years. If fire occurs too frequently, plants are burned before reaching maturity or before they have produced sufficient seed to ensure regeneration of the population. This may cause populations to decline, or even local extinction. Too-infrequent fire also causes population decline, as more plants die of natural attrition without releasing their seed, resulting in seed wastage.

Because of the difficulty of conserving "B. brownii" in its present disease-exposed locations, it is an especially suitable candidate for "ex situ" conservation measures, such as the cold-storage of seed, and the translocation of plants to disease-free locations. Seed of "B. brownii" has been collected by Western Australia's <a href="Threatened%20Flora%20Seed%20Centre">Threatened Flora Seed Centre</a>, and placed in cold-storage both in Perth and at <a href="Royal%20Botanic%20Gardens%2C%20Kew">Kew</a>'s <a href="Millennium%20Seed%20Bank">Millennium Seed Bank</a>. This includes seed collected from populations that have since become extinct. In 2008, some of this seed was germinated, and seedlings were planted at a location near Albany. Genetic analysis of the seedlings revealed some genetic diversity that was not present in any extant population. The conservation of these seeds had thus preserved some of the species' genetic diversity that would otherwise have been lost through population extinction, providing a powerful example of the importance of seed banking to conservation efforts. A seed orchard was planted in 2007, and by 2010 this had yielded over 400 disease-free, healthy plants, some of which had grown more than three times the rate of those in the wild. A 2007 seedling flowered for the first time at <a href="Wakehurst%20Place">Wakehurst Place</a> in February 2011.

With large metallic red inflorescences and attractive feathery leaves that are perhaps the softest of all "Banksia" species, "B. brownii" is highly valued by Australia's horticultural and <a href="cut%20flower%20industry">cut flower industries</a>. Seeds and plants are readily available in Australian nurseries, and it is widely cultivated in areas not exposed to dieback. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 20 to 50 days to <a href="germinate">germinate</a>. The plant prefers a sheltered position in soil with good drainage, and must be provided with moisture over summer. It grows quickly, but takes several years to flower. Once established, it is frost-tolerant and tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage. The flowers are attractive in late bud, but lose their colour as soon as they open. Because they are usually surrounded by branchlets, they may be partly hidden by foliage.

The main obstacle to cultivation is the species' extreme sensitivity to dieback, which is widespread in suburban gardens. However, the species has been successfully <a href="grafting">grafted</a> onto a <a href="rootstock">rootstock</a> of "<a href="Banksia%20integrifolia">B. integrifolia</a>" (coast banksia), which renders it hardy on a range of soils.

Meerkat Manor

Meerkat Manor is a British <a href="television%20program">television program</a>me produced by <a href="Oxford%20Scientific%20Films">Oxford Scientific Films</a> for <a href="Animal%20Planet">Animal Planet International</a> that premiered in September 2005 and ran for four series until its cancellation in August 2008. Using traditional animal <a href="documentary%20film">documentary</a> style footage along with narration, the series told the story of the Whiskers, one of more than a dozen families of <a href="meerkat">meerkat</a>s in the <a href="Kalahari%20Desert">Kalahari Desert</a> being studied as part of the <a href="Kalahari%20Meerkat%20Project">Kalahari Meerkat Project</a>, a long-term <a href="field%20study">field study</a> into the ecological causes and evolutionary consequences of the cooperative nature of meerkats. The original programme was narrated by <a href="Bill%20Nighy">Bill Nighy</a>, with the narration redubbed by <a href="Mike%20Goldman">Mike Goldman</a> for the Australian airings and <a href="Sean%20Astin">Sean Astin</a> for the American broadcasts. The fourth series, subtitled "The Next Generation", saw <a href="Stockard%20Channing">Stockard Channing</a> replacing Astin as the narrator in the American dubbing.

"Meerkat Manor" premiered in the United Kingdom on 12 September 2005, and the first 13-episode series concluded on 24 October 2005. With the success of the programme in the United Kingdom, Animal Planet started broadcasting it on its national channels in Australia, Canada, and the US. It has since been rebroadcast in more than 160 other countries. The fourth, and final, series aired initially in the United States from 6 June 2008 to 22 August 2008. In August 2009, it was reported that the programme had been cancelled.

Although the show faced criticism from viewers for not intervening when a meerkat was injured and faced death, as a whole, "Meerkat Manor" enjoyed considerable success and was Animal Planet's top series in October 2007, both on the cable channel and through its video-on-demand service. The show's experimental format broke new ground in animal documentary filming techniques and allowed viewers a long term, intimate look into the lives of its meerkat stars, breaking the traditional wall between viewer and subject found with most documentaries. In 2007, "Meerkat Manor" was nominated for two <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Awards">Primetime Emmy Awards</a>. It has won three awards at the 2006 Omni Awards, and at the 2006 and 2007 New York Festivals Award Galas. The first three series of the programme have been released to DVD in both <a href="DVD%20region%20code%231">Region 1</a> and <a href="DVD%20region%20code%232">Region 2</a>. In 2007, a book entitled "Meerkat Manor – The Story of Flower of the Kalahari" was released in the UK, detailing the life of Flower and the Whiskers before the series' filming began. A television film, "", documenting Flower's birth and rise to matriarch of the Whiskers aired on Animal Planet on 25 May 2008.

"Meerkat Manor" was created by Caroline Hawkins, executive producer and series editor at Oxford Scientific Films, and commissioned for <a href="Animal%20Planet">Animal Planet International</a> by executive producer and commissioning editor Mark Wild. Filming for a 13-episode series took seven to eight months, and was limited to the Kalahari spring and summer seasons, as meerkats are less active during winter. Series three was filmed from November 2006 through April 2007, and Series four began filming in October 2007. Most scenes were filmed on location at the Kuruman River Reserve, where the <a href="Kalahari%20Meerkat%20Project">Kalahari Meerkat Project</a> that the meerkats are a part of is based. However, the meerkats seen in commercials and on the show's website were not the same animals portrayed in "Meerkat Manor". Instead, tamer-rescued meerkats from the Fellow Earthlings' Wildlife Center were filmed against a <a href="Chroma%20key">green screen</a>.

The show was primarily filmed using <a href="Sony%20DSR-570">Sony DSR-570</a> cameras, although special equipment was needed for some unique footage. For scenes inside the animals' <a href="burrow">burrow</a>s, mini <a href="fiber-optic">fibre-optic</a> <a href="infra-red">infra-red</a> cameras were employed; wide-angle shots were filmed with a seven-metre crane and a remote-controlled camera platform. An off-camera wireless microphone was also used to record many meerkat vocalizations, only partially audible to cameras' on-board systems. Most filming was done by a single cameraman and a single sound engineer; researchers have required a minimal human presence to avoid stressing the animals. Eye-level shots were difficult to achieve at times, due to the meerkats' small size and the limited height of even the smallest tripods.

For tracking purposes by the researchers, the dominant female of each group is fitted with a radio collar, as are some dominant and roaming males. The meerkats – especially younger animals – are marked with dye to differentiate them. As the meerkats are habituated, they would tend to ignore the camera crew as long as their "personal space" was respected.

The UK and US versions of the show have the same content for most episodes; however, the latter was sometimes edited for length to allow for more commercial breaks. Content was also sometimes altered; mating scenes in particular were often removed from the US version. Animal Planet US occasionally changed the names of meerkats and episode titles. Two of Flower's pups were renamed from Ren and Stumpy to Len and Squiggy; the title of the episode was also changed. De la Soul (named for the <a href="De%20La%20Soul">rap group</a> of the same name), one of the sisters who started the Starsky group, was renamed Whoopi in the US as a tribute to actress <a href="Whoopi%20Goldberg">Whoopi Goldberg</a>, an early fan of the series. Animal Planet US has also renamed some of Flower's pups born in season three to honour two other famous fans of the show, <a href="Elizabeth%20Taylor">Elizabeth Taylor</a> and <a href="Denis%20Leary">Denis Leary</a>. Several episodes were renamed: the title of the final episode of the second series was changed from "The Killing Fields" to "The Quiet Fields". During the third series, the third episode's title was changed from "Something's Got to Give" to "Sister Act" (another Goldberg <a href="Sister%20Act">reference</a>), while the sixth episode's title changed from "The House of Zappa" to "Sibling Rivalry".

The show follows several groups of meerkats, who act communally for the benefit of the groups in which they live. These groups are typically led by a dominant female and male, who maintain almost exclusive rights to have offspring. The group followed most closely is known as the Whiskers family. This group was chosen because of its matriarch Flower, an unusually successful dominant female who led the group for five years. During series three, Flower died from a snake bite and was succeeded by her daughter Rocket Dog.

Animals in neighbouring groups were highlighted in each series as well. In the first series, a group called the Lazuli were shown frequently in competition with the Whiskers family, and the opening credits referred to them as the "neighbours from hell". Although their dominant male <a href="List%20of%20Meerkat%20Manor%20meerkats%23Big%20Si">Big Si</a> died between series, the Lazuli appeared in the second series, mostly as a source of roving males. Another group called the Commandoes, led by a one-eyed male named Hannibal, introduced themselves by attacking the Lazuli burrow, killing a pup and badly wounding the babysitting adult. The Commandoes became the new major rivals in the area, killing the pups of evicted Whiskers female Mozart and taking over some of the Whiskers' territory.

The Whiskers' new neighbours were the Zappa and the Starsky. Although smaller than the Whiskers, the Zappa attacked frequently, and when they fled after one attack, the Whiskers – in a rare occurrence – adopted an abandoned Zappa pup. The Starsky group, on the other hand, was no threat to the Whiskers. Formed by a trio of Flower's daughters permanently evicted from the Whiskers, the small group was ravaged by illness, predators, and a lack of new pups. The constantly struggling Starsky succumbed in the penultimate episode, with the death of the last survivor, Mozart, who was killed by a <a href="jackal">jackal</a>. Former Whiskers female <a href="List%20of%20Meerkat%20Manor%20meerkats%23Maybelline">Maybelline</a> broke away from the group at the end of the third series, forming a new group called the <a href="List%20of%20Meerkat%20Manor%20meerkats%23Aztecs">Aztecs</a> which became the Whiskers' rivals in the fourth series.

While the show portrays real events among the Kalahari Meerkats, it also removes repetitive elements of the animals' lives. Because many days are filled with behaviour related to grooming and foraging, these routines were often left out of the show in favour of more unusual events.

The meerkats are all named by Kalahari Meerkat volunteers; the individual who first sees a new litter emerge from the burrow is awarded naming rights. This has produced a variety of names, frequently drawn from volunteers' favourite books, movies, musical groups, family and friends, historical figures and geographical locations. Animal Planet sometimes renamed the meerkats for narration, arguing that researchers' names were too limited, often relating to spices and food condiments. Because of these changes, fans of the series who seek information on the Friends of the Kalahari Meerkat Project website sometimes have trouble locating particular animals. The project has created a list of alterations to help viewers connect the animals on the show to their real-life counterparts, and to match episodes to the monthly KMP Life History reports. The list, however, is only available to paying members of their website.

Two of the major Whiskers family rivals were composites, created with footage and blended stories from multiple groups. For example, the Commandoes group on the show uses some of events from the real Commandoes group, but was primarily shown with footage from the Vivian research group – including its dominant couple. Similarly, the show's Zappa group was mostly presented using footage from a group called "The Young Ones" (named after the <a href="The%20Young%20Ones%20%28TV%20series%29">British television show</a>); however, the actual story and dominant pair were from the real Zappa Group. Axel, the abandoned pup from series three, has a research number that indicates he was probably a Young Ones pup, rather than being a Zappa as the show claims.

"Meerkat Manor" has been well received by viewers and critics alike. In October 2007, it was Animal Planet's top series, with an audience of more than four million in the United States alone. In the United States, its first episode was viewed by one million viewers, and the second and third series premieres were watched by approximately 800,000 viewers each. The fourth series premiere did not fare as well, with fewer than 500,000 viewers. The viewership of the <a href="Video%20on%20demand">on-demand</a> video offerings for "Meerkat Manor" grew 20% in September 2007, when Discovery offered each third series episode, video capsules of series one and two, top ten moments from the show, and a memorial sequence for Flower. Building on the success of "Meerkat Manor's" unique format, Animal Planet commissioned two similarly formatted programmes: "<a href="Orangutan%20Island">Orangutan Island</a>", which focuses on a group of orphaned <a href="orangutan">orangutan</a>s at the Nyaru Menteng Orangutan Rescue and Rehabilitation Center, and "<a href="Lemur%20Street">Lemur Street</a>", which looks at the lives of two rival gangs of <a href="ring-tailed%20lemur">ring-tailed lemur</a>s in <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>.

Some fans have criticized the show for its non-interference policy with regard to the meerkats, asking why the film crew and researchers do not give <a href="anti-venom">anti-venom</a> to snake-bitten meerkats, or <a href="Animal%20euthanasia">euthanize</a> those dying and suffering. US Executive Producer Mick Kaczorowski pointed out that "Meerkat Manor" was a show about the real lives and deaths of the meerkats. The research group has a policy against film crews interceding in natural events "because they don't want to have an effect on the gene pool by saving a weaker meerkat [or] affecting the outcome of what's natural in the Kalahari." As the research project is monitoring "...the breeding success and survival of individuals and ... the factors that affect reproduction and survival" interfering in the natural processes would render the research results invalid. There is one exception to this rule: researchers will euthanize meerkats that contract <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, to prevent outbreaks that would threaten both the meerkat population and nearby cattle.

"Meerkat Manor" was nominated for a 2005 Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival Award in the "Animal Behaviour" category, and in 2007 for "Best Original Score". At the 2006 <a href="Wildscreen%20Festival">Wildscreen Festival</a>, the series was a finalist in three categories: "Animal Behaviour", "Innovation", and "Popular Broadcast". The series won Gold Statues in "Natural History" and "Cinematography", and a Silver Statue for "Writing", at the 2006 Omni Awards. The eighth episode of series three, "Journey's End" which depicts the death of Whiskers matriarch Flower, was awarded the 2008 Wildscreen Festival Panda Award in the "Five Award for Popular Broadcast Programme" category. "Meerkat Manor" was a two-time Gold Medal winner in the "Nature & Wildlife" category at the New York Festivals Award Gala, in 2006 for series one, and again in 2007 for series one and two. The series was nominated for two <a href="59th%20Primetime%20Emmy%20Awards">Primetime Emmy Awards</a> in 2007: one for "Outstanding Cinematography for Nonfiction Programming" and one for "Outstanding Picture Editing for Nonfiction Programming". In 2009 the series was awarded the Grand Award at the <a href="New%20York%20Festivals">New York Festivals</a> International Television Programming and Promotion Awards in the "Family Programmes" category.

"Meerkat Manor's" innovative new methods of filming allowed the Kalahari Project scientists a chance to uncover aspects of meerkat life never before seen, including life within the burrows. The film crew was also the first to capture meerkat <a href="Infanticide%20%28zoology%29">infanticide</a> on film.

While many documentaries maintain an emotional distance from their subjects, "Meerkat Manor" – due to its extended length, soap opera-like narration, romanticization of the animals' lives, and close-up filming techniques, provides a closer, more personal view of the meerkats. Viewers describe being emotionally involved in the animals' lives, sometimes forgetting they are watching a documentary. The meerkats' frequently short lives and brutal deaths become surprising and disturbing to some audiences. This experimental format was seen as expanding the boundaries of both the nature <a href="Documentary%20film">documentary</a> genre and the nature of reality TV.

A book written by Professor <a href="Tim%20Clutton-Brock">Tim Clutton-Brock</a> entitled "Meerkat Manor: The Story of Flower of the Kalahari" () was released in the UK in a <a href="hardback">hardback</a> edition on 4 October 2007. The book focuses on Flower's life and the story of the Whiskers, tracing how the group started, providing a timeline of Flower's life, and detailing all of the pups she had over her lifetime, as well as their current locations. The book also gives more background on how the Kalahari Meerkat Project started, the research goals and results, and researchers' personal lives. A <a href="paperback">paperback</a> edition of the book was announced for release in the United States by <a href="Simon%20%26amp%3B%20Schuster">Simon & Schuster</a> through their Touchstone imprint on 15 April 2008. The US release was titled "Meerkat Manor: Flower of the Kalahari" (). In November 2007, Discovery Communications announced that it was partnering with <a href="Activision">Activision</a> to make a <a href="video%20game">video game</a> based on "Meerkat Manor" as the first in a new series of nature-based games. The announcement stated the game would be released to multiple platforms in late 2008, but no game was ever released.

Oxford Scientific Films produced a feature film for Discovery Films that acts as a <a href="prequel">prequel</a> to the "Meerkat Manor" series. Originally announced as "Flower: Queen of the Kalahari", "Meerkat Manor: The Story Begins" was directed by Chris Barker and Mike Slee and narrated by <a href="Whoopi%20Goldberg">Whoopi Goldberg</a>. The film documents Flower's early life as she grows from a young meerkat to become one of the most successful leaders of the Whiskers clan. The film was introduced at the 2008 <a href="Tribeca%20Film%20Festival">Tribeca Film Festival</a> in the Spotlight section, and then aired in the United States on <a href="Animal%20Planet">Animal Planet</a> on 25 May 2008 as a lead-in to a thirty-minute "Making of Meerkat Manor: the Story Begins" special. It was released to <a href="DVD%20region%20code%231">Region 1</a> <a href="DVD">DVD</a> in North America on 3 June 2008, with the "Making of Meerkat Manor" special, and another special, "The Science of Meerkat Manor", included as extras.

The film included re-edited footage and a new musical score. The Whiskers story was simplified, with the <a href="List%20of%20Meerkat%20Manor%20meerkats%23Lazuli">Lazuli</a> being the only rival group to appear in the film. Unlike with the "Meerkat Manor" series, the film does not actually depict any of the real Whiskers meerkats. Untrained "meerkat actors" play the role of Flower and her family, with the camera crew searching out appropriately-aged meerkats, then following them until the meerkats acted in a way that was needed for the film. Flower herself was depicted by approximately eight female meerkats.

Vithoba

Vithoba, also known as Vitthal, Vitthala and Panduranga, is a <a href="deva%20%28Hinduism%29">Hindu deity</a> predominantly worshipped in the Indian state of <a href="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a>. He is generally considered a manifestation of the god <a href="Vishnu">Vishnu</a> or his <a href="avatar">avatar</a>, <a href="Krishna">Krishna</a>. Vithoba is often depicted as a dark young boy, standing arms akimbo on a brick, sometimes accompanied by his main consort <a href="Rukmini">Rakhumai</a>.

Vithoba is the focus of an essentially <a href="monotheism">monotheistic</a>, non-ritualistic <a href="bhakti">bhakti</a>-driven <a href="Varkari">Varkari</a> faith of <a href="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a> and the <a href="Haridasa">Haridasa</a> faith.<a href="Vitthal%20Temple%2C%20Pandharpur">Vitthal Temple, Pandharpur</a> is his main temple. Vithoba legends revolve around his devotee <a href="Pundalik">Pundalik</a>, who is credited with bringing the deity to Pandharpur, and around Vithoba's role as a saviour to the poet-saints of the Varkari faith. The Varkari poet-saints are known for their unique genre of devotional lyric, the <a href="abhang">abhang</a>, dedicated to Vithoba and composed in <a href="Marathi%20language">Marathi</a>. Other devotional literature dedicated to Vithoba includes the hymns of the Haridasa and the Marathi versions of the generic <a href="aarti">aarti</a> songs associated with rituals of offering light to the deity. The most important festivals of Vithoba are held on <a href="Shayani%20Ekadashi">Shayani Ekadashi</a> in the month of <a href="Ashadha">Ashadha</a>, and <a href="Prabodhini%20Ekadashi">Prabodhini Ekadashi</a> in the month of <a href="Kartik%20%28month%29">Kartik</a>.

The historiography of Vithoba and his <a href="cult%20%28religious%20practice%29">cult</a> is an area of continuing debate, even regarding his name. Various <a href="indology">Indologists</a> have proposed a prehistory for Vithoba worship where he was previously: a <a href="hero%20stone">hero stone</a>, a pastoral deity, a manifestation of <a href="Shiva">Shiva</a>, a <a href="Jain%20monasticism">Jain saint</a>, or even all of these at various times for various devotees. Though the origins of both his cult and his main temple are likewise debated, there is clear evidence that they already existed by the 13th century.

Vithoba (, ) is known by many names, including: Vitthala, Panduranga, Pandharinath, Hari and Narayan.

There are several theories about the origins and meanings of these names. <a href="Varkari">Varkari</a> tradition suggests that the name Vitthala (also spelled as Vitthal, Viththal, Vittala and Vithal; , '; , and ; ) is composed of two Sanskrit-Marathi words: ', which means 'brick'; and "thal", which may have originated from the Sanskrit "sthala", meaning 'standing'. Thus, Vitthala would mean 'one standing on a brick'. <a href="William%20Crooke">William Crooke</a>, <a href="oriental%20studies">orientalist</a>, supported this explanation. The prescribed iconography of Vithoba stipulates that he be shown standing arms-akimbo upon a brick, which is associated with the legend of the devotee Pundalik.

However, the Varkari poet-saint <a href="Tukaram">Tukaram</a> proposed a different etymology—that Vitthala is composed of the words "vittha" (ignorance) and "la" (one who accepts), thus meaning 'one who accepts innocent people who are devoid of knowledge'. Historian <a href="Ramakrishna%20Gopal%20Bhandarkar">Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar</a> offers yet another possibility—that Vitthu () is a Kannada corruption of the name Vishnu adopted in Marathi. The suffixes -"la" and -"ba" (meaning 'father' in Marathi) were appended for reverence, producing the names Vitthala and Vithoba. This corruption of Vishnu to Vitthu could have been due to the tendency of Marathi and Kannada people to pronounce the Sanskrit ' () as ' (), attested since the 8th century.

According to research scholar M. S. Mate of the <a href="Deccan%20College%20%28Pune%29">Deccan College</a>, Pundalik—who is assumed to be a historical figure—was instrumental in persuading the <a href="Hoysala">Hoysala</a> king <a href="Vishnuvardhana">Vishnuvardhana</a> alias Bittidev to build the Pandharpur temple dedicated to Vishnu. The deity was subsequently named as Vitthala, a derivative of Bittidev, by the builder-king. Other variants of the name include (King Vitthala), and (Mother Vitthala). The people of <a href="Gujarat">Gujarat</a> add the suffix -"nath" (Lord) to Vitthala, which yields the name Vitthal-nath. The additional honorific suffix <a href="-ji">-ji</a> may be added, giving the name Vitthalnathji. This name is generally used in the <a href="Pushtimarg">Pushtimarg</a> sect.

Panduranga (, , ; all ), also spelt as Pandurang and Pandaranga, is another popular epithet for Vithoba, which means 'the white god' in Sanskrit. The Jain author-saint <a href="Hemachandra">Hemachandra</a> (1089–1172 AD) notes it is also used as an epithet for the god <a href="Rudra">Rudra</a>-Shiva. Even though Vithoba is depicted with dark complexion, he is called a "white god". Bhandarkar explains this paradox, proposing that Panduranga may be an epithet for the form of Shiva worshipped in Pandharpur, and whose temple still stands. Later, with the increasing popularity of Vithoba's cult, this was also transferred to Vithoba. Another theory suggests that Vithoba may initially have been a <a href="Shaivism">Shaiva</a> god (related to Shiva), only later identified with Vishnu, thus explaining the usage of Panduranga for Vithoba. Crooke, however, proposed that Panduranga is a Sanskritised form of Pandaraga (belonging to Pandarga), referring to the old name of Pandharpur. Another name, Pandharinath, also refers to Vithoba as the lord of Pandhari (yet another variant for Pandharpur).

Finally, Vithoba is also addressed by the names of Vishnu like <a href="Hari">Hari</a> and <a href="Narayana">Narayana</a>, in the <a href="Vaishnavism">Vaishnava sect</a>.

Reconstruction of the historical development of Vithoba worship has been much debated. In particular, several alternative theories have been proposed regarding the earliest stages, as well as the point at which he came to be recognised as a distinct deity. The "Pandurangashtakam stotra", a hymn attributed to <a href="Adi%20Shankara">Adi Shankara</a>charya of the 8th century, indicates that Vithoba worship might have already existed at an early date.

According to Richard Maxwell Eaton, author of "A Social History of the Deccan", Vithoba was first worshipped as a pastoral god as early as the 6th century. Vithoba's arms-akimbo iconography is similar to <a href="Bir%20Kuar">Bir Kuar</a>, the cattle-god of the <a href="Ahirs">Ahirs</a> of <a href="Bihar">Bihar</a>, who is now also associated with Krishna. Vithoba was probably later assimilated into the Shaiva pantheon and identified with the god Shiva, like most other pastoral gods. This is backed by the facts that the temple at Pandharpur is surrounded by Shaiva temples (most notably of the devotee Pundalik himself), and that Vithoba is crowned with the <a href="Linga">Linga</a>, symbol of Shiva. However, since the 13th century, the poet-saints like <a href="Namdev">Namdev</a>, <a href="Eknath">Eknath</a> and Tukaram identified Vithoba with Vishnu.

Christian Lee Novetzke of the <a href="University%20of%20Washington">University of Washington</a> suggests that Vithoba's worship migrated from Karnataka to the formerly Shaiva city of Pandharpur some time before 1000 CE; but under the possible influence of a Krishna-worshipping <a href="Mahanubhava">Mahanubhava</a> sect, the town was transformed into a Vaishnava center of pilgrimage. This proposal is consistent with contemporary remnants of Shaiva worship in the town.
The religious historian <a href="R.C.%20Dhere">R.C. Dhere</a>, winner of the <a href="Sahitya%20Akademi%20Award">Sahitya Akademi Award</a> for his book "Sri Vitthal: Ek Mahasamanvaya", opines that Vithoba worship may be even older—"<a href="Vedic%20period">Vedic</a> or pre-Vedic", hence pre-dating the worship of Krishna. According to this theory, Vithoba is an amalgam of various local heroes, who gave their lives to save their cattle. He was first worshipped by the <a href="Dhangar">Dhangar</a>, the cattle-owning <a href="caste">caste</a> of Maharashtra. The rise of the <a href="Seuna%20Yadavas%20of%20Devagiri">Yadava dynasty</a>, which had cowherd ancestry, could have led to the glorification of Vithoba as Krishna, who is often depicted as a cowherd. This Vaishnavization of Vithoba also led to conversion of the Shaiva Pundarika shrine to the Vaishnava shrine of the devotee Pundalik, who—according to legend—brought Vithoba to Pandharpur. There may have been an attempt to assimilate Vithoba into <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>; today, both are viewed as <a href="Gautama%20Buddha%20in%20Hinduism">a form of Vishnu</a> in Hinduism.

Despite assimilation in Vaishnavism as Krishna-Vishnu, Vithoba does not inherit the erotic overtones of Krishna, such as his dalliance with the "<a href="gopi">gopi</a>s" (milkmaids). Vithoba is associated more with "compassion, an infinite love and tenderness for his "bhaktas" (devotees) that can be compared to the love of the mother for her children .. pining for the presence of his devotees the way a cow pines for her far-away calf."

G. A. Deleury, author of "The cult of Vithoba", proposes that the image of Vithoba is a "viragal" (<a href="hero%20stone">hero stone</a>), which was later identified with Vishnu in his form as Krishna, and that Pundalik transformed the Puranic, ritualistic "<a href="Puja%20%28Hinduism%29">puja</a>" worship into more idealised "<a href="bhakti">bhakti</a>" worship—"interiorized adoration prescinding caste distinction and institutional priesthood .." Indologist Dr. Tilak suggests that Vithoba emerged as "an alternative to the existing pantheon" of brahminical deities (related to classical, ritualistic Hinduism). The emergence of Vithoba was concurrent with the rise of a "new type of lay devotee", the Varkari. While Vishnu and Shiva were bound in rigid ritualistic worship and <a href="Brahmin">Brahmin</a> (priestly) control, Vithoba, "the God of the subaltern, became increasingly human." Vithoba is often praised as the protector of the poor and needy. Stevenson (1843) suggests that Vithoba could have been a Jain saint, as the Vithoba images were similar to Jain images.

Scholastic investigation of Vithoba's history often begins with consideration of the dating of the chief temple at Pandharpur, which is believed to be the earliest Vithoba temple. The oldest part of the temple dates to the Yadava period of the 12th and 13th centuries. Most of the temple is believed to have been built in the 17th century, though addition to the temple has never ceased. The date the temple was first established is unclear to Bhandarkar, but he insists there is clear evidence to suggest it existed by the 13th century. According to S. G. Tulpule, the temple stood as early as 1189. In fact, a monument dated 1189 records establishment of a small Vithoba shrine at the present location of the temple; thus, Tulpule concludes, the worship of Vithoba predates 1189.

A stone inscription dated 1237, found on an overhead beam of the present Vithoba temple, mentions that the Hoysala king <a href="Vira%20Someshwara">Someshvara</a> donated a village for the expense of the "bhoga" (food offering) for "Vitthala". An inscription on a copper plate, dated 1249, records the Yadava king Krishna granting to one of his generals the village Paundrikakshetra ("kshetra" of Pundarik), on the river Bhimarathi, in the presence of the god Vishnu. Another stone inscription in Pandharpur narrates a sacrifice at Pandurangapura due to which "people and Vitthal along with the gods were gratified". Thus from the 13th century, the city is known as the city of Panduranga. Inside the temple, a stone inscription records gifts to the temple between 1272 and 1277 from various donors, notably the Yadava king Ramachandra's minister <a href="Hemadri">Hemadri</a>.

Ranade believes that an inscription, found in <a href="Alandi">Alandi</a> and referring to Vitthala and Rakhumai, is the oldest related to Vithoba, and dates it to 1209. However, the name Pandaranga is found on a <a href="Rashtrakuta">Rashtrakuta</a> copper plate inscription, dated 516. Citing this, Pande infers that Vithoba's cult was well established by the 6th century.

The physical characteristics of the central "<a href="murti">murti</a>" (image) of Vithoba at Pandharpur, and various textual references to it, have inspired theories relating to Vithoba worship. Sand concludes, from a version of Pundalik's legend in the <a href="Skanda%20Purana">Skanda Purana</a> (see <a href="%23Legend">Legend</a> below), that two distinct "murtis" must have existed at Pandharpur—one each of <a href="Tirtha%20and%20Kshetra">"tirtha" and "kshetra"</a> type. The earlier one was a "tirtha murti", an image purposely sited near a holy body of water ("tirtha"), in this case facing west, on the <a href="Bhima%20River">Bhima</a> riverbed, near the Pundalik shrine. The later murti, according to Sand, was a "kshetra murti", located at a place of holy power ("kshetra"), in this case facing east, on the hill where the current temple has stood since about 1189. Thus, Sand proposes that the worship of Vithoba may predate the temple itself.

Deleury suggests that although the temple may have been built in the 13th century, given the <a href="Hemadpanthi">Hemadpanthi</a> style architecture, the statue of Vithoba is of an earlier style so may have been carved for an earlier, smaller shrine that existed in Pandharpur. The workmanship of the image is earlier than the style of the Yadava (1175–1318), the Anhivad <a href="Chalukya%20dynasty">Chalukya</a> (943–1210) and even the Ajmer <a href="Chauhan">Chohans</a> (685–1193) eras. Although no other existing Vishnu temple has iconography like Pandharpur's Vithoba, Deleury finds similarities between the Pandharpur image and the third-century, arms-akimbo Vishnu images at <a href="Udaygiri%20Caves">Udaygiri Caves</a>, <a href="Madhya%20Pradesh">Madhya Pradesh</a> but declares that they are from different schools of sculpture.

The devotee Pundalik, thrower of the brick (see <a href="Vithoba%23Legend">Legend</a> below), is a major character in the legends of Vithoba. He is commonly perceived to be a historical figure, connected with the establishment and propagation of the Vithoba-centric Varkari sect. Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar considers Pundalik to be the founder of the Varkari sect and the one who promulgated the sect in Maratha country. Stevenson (1843) goes further, suggesting he might have been a Jain or a Buddhist, since Varkari tradition is a combination of Jain and Buddhist morals, and Vithoba is viewed as Vishnu in his form as Buddha. Frazer, Edwards and P.R. Bhandarkar (1922) all suggest that Pundalik tried to unify Shiva and Vishnu, and that this sect originated in Karnataka. Ranade (1933) thinks that Pundalik, a Kannada saint, was not only the founder of the Varkari sect but also the first great devotee or first high priest of the Pandharpur temple. Upadhyaya supports the priest theory but declines the Kannada origin theory. According to M. S. Mate, Pundalik was instrumental in coaxing the Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana to build the Pandharpur temple to Vishnu, placing him in the early 12th century. Other scholars like Raeside (1965), Dhanpalvar (1972), and Vaudeville (1974) have questioned the historicity of Pundalik altogether, and dismissed him as a mythical figure.

Primarily, there are three Hindu deities associated with Vithoba: Vishnu, Krishna and Shiva. Gautama Buddha is also associated with Vithoba, consistent with Hindu deification of the Buddha as the ninth incarnation of Vishnu. However, Varkari consider Vithoba to be the "svarup" (original)
Vishnu himself, not an "<a href="Avatar">Avatar</a>" (manifestation) of Vishnu like Krishna, despite legends and consorts linking Vithoba to Krishna. However, even the <a href="Mahanubhava">Mahanubhava</a>s, who rose in the 13th century as a Krishna-worshipping sect, not only dismissed the notion that Vithoba is Krishna but also frequently vilified Vithoba.

In some traditions though, Vithoba is also worshipped as a form of Shiva. The Dhangars still consider Vithoba to be a brother of the god <a href="Viroba">Viroba</a>, and view Vithoba as a Shaiva god rather than a Vaishnava one. Underhill proposes that the shrine of Pandharpur is a combined form of Vishnu-Shiva established by the <a href="Bhagavata">Bhagavata</a> sect that worships Vishnu-Shiva—the Lord, which is what "bhagavata" means. However, for the chief priests of the Pandharpur temple—Brahmins of the Badva family —" is neither nor . is " (<a href="International%20Alphabet%20of%20Sanskrit%20Transliteration">IAST</a> original). Despite this, some priests of the temple point to marks on the Vithoba image's chest as proof of Vithoba being Vishnu, in his form as Krishna.

Vithoba's image replaces the traditional representation of <a href="Gautama%20Buddha%20in%20Hinduism">Buddha</a>, when depicted as the ninth avatar of Vishnu, in some temple sculptures and <a href="panchanga">Hindu astrological almanacs</a> in Maharashtra. In the 17th century, <a href="Maratha">Maratha</a> artists sculpted an image of Pandharpur's Vithoba in the Buddha's place on a panel showing Vishnu's avatars. This can be found in the <a href="Shivneri%20Caves">Shivneri Caves</a>. Stevenson goes so far as to call devotees of Vithoba ("Vithal-bhaktas") Buddhist Vaishnavas ("Bauddho-Vaishnavas"), since they consider Vithoba to be the ninth—namely Buddha—avatar of Vishnu. Some of the poet-saints praised Vithoba as a form of Buddha. <a href="B.%20R.%20Ambedkar">B. R. Ambedkar</a>, an Indian political leader and Buddhist convert, suggested that the image of Vithoba at Pandharpur was in reality the image of the Buddha.

All Vithoba images are generally modelled on his central image in Pandharpur. The Pandharpur image is a black basalt sculpture that is tall. Vithoba is depicted as dark young boy. The poet-saints have called him "<a href="Para%20Brahman">Para-brahman</a> with a dark complexion". He wears high, conical headgear or a crown, interpreted as Shiva's symbol—the Linga. Thus, according to Zelliot, Vithoba represents Shiva as well as Vishnu. The first Varkari poet-saint, <a href="Dnyaneshwar">Dnyaneshwar</a> (13th century), states that Vithoba (Vishnu) carries Shiva, who according to Vaishnavism is Vishnu's first and foremost devotee, on his own head.

Vithoba is shown standing arms-akimbo on the brick thrown by the devotee Pundalik. He wears a necklace of <a href="tulsi">tulsi</a>-beads, embedded with the legendary "<a href="kaustubha">kaustubha</a>" gem, and "makara-kundala" (fish-shaped earrings) that the poet-saint Tukaram relates to the iconography of Vishnu. Pandharpur's Vithoba holds a "<a href="shankha">shankha</a>" (conch) in his left hand and a "<a href="chakra">chakra</a>" (discus) or lotus flower in his right, all of which are symbols traditionally associated with Vishnu. Some images depict Vithoba's right hand making a gesture that has been traditionally misunderstood as a blessing; no gesture of blessing is present in the Pandharpur image. Though usually depicted two-armed, four-armed representations of the deity also exist.

The Pandharpur image, when not clothed by its attendant priest to receive devotees, provides Vithoba with the detailed features distinctive of a male body, visible in full relief. However, close inspection of the stonework reveals the outline of a <a href="loincloth">loincloth</a>, supported by a "kambarband" (waist belt), traced by thin, light carvings. Other images and pictures depict Vithoba clothed, usually with "pitambara" – a yellow <a href="dhoti">dhoti</a> and various gold ornaments—the manner in which he is attired by the priests in the daily rites.

The Pandharpur image also bears, on the left breast, the mark known as the "<a href="srivatsa">srivatsa</a>lanchhana"—said to be a curl of white hair, usually found on the breast of Vishnu and Krishna images. The image is also dignified with a ring-shaped mark called "shriniketana" on the right breast, "mekhala" (a three-stringed waist-belt), a long stick ("kathi") embedded in the ground between the legs, and double ring and pearl bracelets on the elbows. 

Vithoba is usually depicted with his main consort, Rakhumai, on his left side. Rakhumai (or Rakhamai) literally means 'mother Rukmini'. Rukmini is traditionally viewed as the wife of Krishna. Hindus generally consider Krishna to be a form of Vishnu, hence his consort as a form of <a href="Lakshmi">Lakshmi</a>. Just like her consort, Rakhumai is also depicted in the arms-akimbo posture, standing on a brick. She has an independent <a href="cella">cella</a> in the Pandharpur temple complex. According to Ghurye, Rukmini—a princess of the <a href="Vidarbha">Vidarbha</a> region of Maharashtra—was elevated to the status of the main consort instead of <a href="Radha">Radha</a>, because of her affiliation with the region. According to Dhangar tradition, Rukhumai is worshipped by the community as Padmavati or Padubai, a protector of the community and cattle in particular. Dhangar folklore explains the reason behind separate shrines for Vithoba and Padubai as the outcome of Vithoba invoking a curse on his consort, and his non-attachment to "<a href="samsara">samsara</a>" (the householder's life). Apart from Rakhumai, two other consorts <a href="Satyabhama">Satyabhama</a> and Rahi (derived from Radha) are worshipped too. All three consorts are regarded as Krishna's in Hindu mythology.

Vithoba is a popular deity in Maharashtra ; devotees also exist in <a href="Goa">Goa</a> and <a href="Gujarat">Gujarat</a>, but not in the same numbers. Vithoba is worshipped and revered by most Marathis, but he is not popular as a "<a href="kuldevta">kuldevta</a>" (family deity). The main temple of Vithoba, which includes a distinct, additional shrine for his consort Rakhumai, is located at Pandharpur. In this context, Pandharpur is affectionately called "Bhu-<a href="Vaikuntha">Vaikuntha</a>" (the place of residence of Vishnu on earth) by devotees. Devotees have visited Vithoba's central temple at Pandharpur, since the times of Dnyaneshwar (13th century).

Two distinct traditions revolve around the worship of Vithoba in Maharashtra: ritual worship inside the temple by the <a href="Brahmin">Brahmin</a> priests of the Badva family; and spiritual worship by the Varkaris. The ritual worship includes five daily rites. First, at about 3 am, is an "arati" to awaken the god, called . Next comes the , a "puja" that includes a bath with five ("pancha") sweet substances called "<a href="panchamrita">panchamrita</a>". The image is then dressed to receive morning devotions. The third rite is another "puja" involving re-dressing and lunch at noon. This is known as . Afternoon devotions are followed by a fourth rite for dinner at sunset—the . The final rite is , an "arati" for putting the god to sleep. In addition to the rites at the main temple in Pandharpur, Haridasa traditions dedicated to Vitthala flourish in Karnataka.

The <a href="Varkari">Varkari</a> Panth (Pilgrim Path) or Varkari <a href="Sampradaya">Sampradaya</a> (Pilgrim Tradition) is one of the most important Vaishnava sects in India. According to Raeside, it is an essentially monotheistic, "bhakti" sect, focused on the worship of Vithoba and based on traditional Bhagavata "<a href="dharma">dharma</a>". The sect is a "Shaiva-Vaishnava synthesis" and "nominal Vaishnavism, containing a free mix of other religions". It is believed to have originated in Karnataka and migrated to Maharashtra. This last theory is based on a reference to Vithoba as "Kannada" (belonging to Karnataka) in the work of the first of the poet-saints, <a href="Dnyaneshwar">Dnyaneshwar</a>. However, this word can also be interpreted as "difficult to understand". Varkaris and scholars who believe Pundalik to have been a historical figure also consider him to be founder of the cult of Vithoba. This is evidenced by the liturgical call—"Pundalikavarada Hari Vitthala!"—which means "O Hari Vitthala (Vithoba), who has given a boon to Pundalik!" However, according to Zelliot, the sect was founded by Dnyaneshwar (also spelled Jnaneshwar), who was a Brahmin poet and philosopher and flourished during the period 1275–1296. Varkaris also give him credit with the saying—"Dnyanadev rachila paya"—which means "Dnyaneshwar laid the foundation stone".
<a href="Namdev">Namdev</a> ("c". 1270–1350), a <a href="Shudra">Shudra</a> tailor, wrote short <a href="Marathi%20literature">Marathi devotional poems</a> in praise of Vithoba called "abhangas" (literally 'unbroken'), and used the call-and-response "<a href="kirtan">kirtan</a>" (literally 'repeating') form of singing to praise the glory of his Lord. Public performance of this musical devotion led to the spread of the Vithoba faith, which accepted women, Shudras and outcaste "<a href="Dalit">untouchables</a>", something forbidden in classical brahminical Hinduism. In the times of Muslim rulers, the faith faced stagnation. However, after the decline of the <a href="Vijayanagara%20empire">Vijayanagara empire</a>, when wars erupted in the <a href="Deccan%20Plateau">Deccan</a> region, the Muslim rulers had to accept the faiths of Maharashtra in order to gather the support of its people. In this period, <a href="Eknath">Eknath</a> ("c". 1533–99) revived the Varkari tradition. With the foundation of the <a href="Maratha%20empire">Maratha empire</a> under <a href="Shivaji">Shivaji</a>, <a href="Tukaram">Tukaram</a> ("c". 1568–1650), a Shudra grocer, further propagated the Vithoba-centric tradition throughout the Maharashtra region.

All these poet-saints, and others like <a href="Janabai">Janabai</a>, the maidservant of Namdev, wrote poetry dedicated to Vithoba. This Marathi poetry advocates pure devotion, referring to Vithoba mostly as a father, or in the case of the female saint Janabai's poetry, as a mother (Vithabai). Not only women, like Janabai, but also a wide variety of people from different castes and backgrounds wrote "abhangas" in praise of Vithoba: <a href="Visoba%20Khechara">Visoba Khechara</a> (who was an orthodox Shaiva and teacher of Namdev), <a href="Sena%20Nhavi">Sena the barber</a>, <a href="Narahari%20Sonar">Narhari the goldsmith</a>, <a href="Savata%20Mali">Savata the gardener</a>, <a href="Gora%20Kumbhar">Gora the potter</a>, <a href="Kanhopatra">Kanhopatra</a> the dancing girl, <a href="Chokhamela">Chokhamela</a> the "untouchable" <a href="Mahar">Mahar</a>, and even the <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> <a href="Sheikh%20Muhammad">Sheikh Muhammad</a> (1560–1650). Anyone born Shaiva or Vaishnava who considers Vithoba his "maya-baap" (mother-father) and Pandharpur his "maher" (maternal house of a bride) is accepted as a Varkari by the sect irrespective of the barriers of <a href="caste">caste</a>. Varkaris often practice Vithoba "<a href="japa">japa</a>" (meditative repetition of a divine name), and observe a fast on the "ekadashi" of each month.

<a href="Haridasa">Haridasa</a> means servant ("<a href="dasa">dasa</a>") of Vishnu (Hari). According to Haridasa tradition, their "sampradaya", also known as Haridasa-kuta, was founded by <a href="Achalananda%20Vitthala">Achalananda Vitthala</a> ("c". 888). It is a distinct branch within Vaishnavism, centered on Vitthala (the Haridasa–Kannada name for Vithoba).
Where Varkari are normally associated with Maharashtra, Haridasa are normally associated with Karnataka. The scholar Sharma considers Vithoba worship first emerged in Karnataka, only later moving to Maharashtra. He argues this on the basis of the reference by Dnyaneshwar, mentioned in section "Varkari sect" above. Lutgendorf credits the movement to <a href="Vyasatirtha">Vyasatirtha</a> (1478–1539), the royal <a href="guru">guru</a> ("rajguru") to king <a href="Krishnadevaraya">Krishnadevaraya</a> of the Vijayanagara empire. Vitthala enjoyed royal patronage in this era. Krishnadevaraya is also credited with building <a href="Vijaynagara%23Vittala%20Temple">Vitthala's temple</a> at the then capital city <a href="Vijayanagara">Vijayanagara</a> (modern <a href="Hampi">Hampi</a>).

Haridasas consider the temple of Pandharpur to be sacred, as well that of Hampi, and worship Vitthala along with forms of Krishna. Haridasa literature generally deals with praise dedicated to Vitthala and Krishna. Haridasa poets like <a href="Vijaya%20Dasa">Vijaya Vitthala</a>, <a href="Gopala%20Dasa">Gopala Vitthala</a>, Jagannatha Vitthala, Venugopala Vitthala and Mohana Vitthala assumed pen-names ending with "Vitthala", as an act of devotion. The Haridasa poet <a href="Purandara%20Dasa">Purandara Dasa</a> or Purandara Vitthala (1484–1564), "father of <a href="Carnatic%20music">Carnatic music</a>", often ended his Kannada language compositions with a salutation to Vitthala.

The founder of the Hindu sect <a href="Pushtimarg">Pushtimarg</a> – <a href="Vallabhacharya">Vallabhacharya</a> (1479–1531) is believed to have visited Pandharpur at least twice and was ordered to marry by Vithoba (called Vitthalnath or Vitthalnathji in the sect) and have children so that he could be born as Vallabhacharya's son. Later, Vallabhacharya married. His second son and successor was recognized as a manifestation of Vithoba and named Vitthalnath, also known as <a href="Gusainji">Gusainji</a>.

The festivals associated with Vithoba primarily correspond to the bi-annual "<a href="yatra">yatra</a>s" (pilgrimages) of the Varkaris. The pilgrims travel to the Pandharpur temple from Alandi and <a href="Dehu">Dehu</a>, towns closely associated with poet-saints Dnyaneshwar and Tukaram respectively. Along the way, they sing "abhangas" (devotional songs) dedicated to Vithoba and repeat his name, carrying the "<a href="palkhi">palkhi</a>s" (palanquins) of the poet-saints. Varkaris do not engage in ritual worship but only practice "<a href="Dar%C5%9Bana">darshan</a>" (visual adoration) of the deity. The ritual worship by the priests is restricted to five days each around the Ashadha (June–July) and Kartik (October–November) <a href="Ekadashi">Ekadashi</a>s, when a large number of Varkaris participate in the "yatras". In smaller numbers, the Varkaris also visit the temple on two other Ekadashis—in the Hindu months of <a href="Maagha">Magha</a> and <a href="Chaitra">Chaitra</a>.

More than 800,000 Varkaris travel to Pandharpur for the "yatra" on Shayani Ekadashi, the 11th day of the <a href="Lunar%20phase">waxing moon</a> in the lunar month of Ashadha. Both Shayani Ekadashi and <a href="Prabodhini%20Ekadashi">Prabodhini Ekadashi</a> (in the waxing half of Kartik), are associated with the mythology of Vishnu. Hindus believe that Vishnu falls asleep in <a href="Ksheersagar">Ksheersagar</a> (a cosmic ocean of milk), while lying on the back of <a href="Shesha">Shesha-nāga</a> (the cosmic serpent). His sleep begins on Shayani Ekadashi (literally the 'sleeping 11th') and he finally awakens from his slumber, four months later, on Prabodhini Ekadashi. The celebrations in Ashadha and Kartik continue until the full-moon in those months, concluding with torchlight processions. Inscriptions dating to the 11th century mention the Ekadashi pilgrimages to Pandharpur. On Shayani Ekadashi and Prabodini Ekadashi, the <a href="List%20of%20Chief%20Ministers%20of%20India">chief minister</a> or a minister of Maharashtra state performs ritual components of worship on behalf of the <a href="Government%20of%20Maharashtra">Government of Maharashtra</a>. This form of worship is known as "sarkari-mahapuja".

Apart from the four Ekadashis, a fair is held on <a href="Navrati">Dussera</a> night at Pandharpur, when devotees dance on a large slab ("ranga-shila") before Vithoba, accompanied with torchlight processions. Other observances at the Pandharpur temple include: <a href="Holi">Ranga-Panchami</a>, when "<a href="gulal">gulal</a>" (red powder) is sprinkled on the god's feet; and <a href="Krishna%20Janmashtami">Krishna Janmashtami</a>, Krishna's birthday, when devotees dance and sing in front of Vithoba for nine days. Other sacred days include Wednesdays, Saturdays and all other Ekadashis, all of which are considered holy in Vaishnavism.

Devotional works dedicated to Vithoba can be categorised into the Varkari tradition, the Brahmin tradition and what Raeside calls a "third tradition", that includes both Varkari and Brahmin elements. The Varkari texts are written in Marathi, the Brahmin texts in Sanskrit, and the "third tradition" are Marathi texts written by Brahmins.

The Varkari texts are: "<a href="Bhaktalilamrita">Bhaktalilamrita</a>" and "<a href="Bhaktavijaya">Bhaktavijaya</a>" by <a href="Mahipati">Mahipati</a>, "Pundalika-Mahatmya" by <a href="Bahinabai">Bahinabai</a>, and a long "abhanga" by <a href="Namdev">Namdev</a>. All these texts describe the legend of Pundalik. The Brahmin texts include: two versions of "Panduranga-Mahatmya" from the <a href="Skanda%20Purana">Skanda Purana</a> (consisting of 900 verses); "Panduranga-Mahatmya" from the <a href="Padma%20Purana">Padma Purana</a> (consisting of 1,200 verses); "Bhima-Mahatmya", also from the Padma Purana; and a third devotional work, yet again called "Panduranga-Mahatmya", which is found in the <a href="Vishnu%20Purana">Vishnu Purana</a>. The "third tradition" is found in two works: "Panduranga-Mahatmya" by the Brahmin Sridhara (consisting of 750 verses), and another work of the same name written by Prahlada Maharaj (consisting of 181 verses).

In addition to the above, there are many "abhangas", the short <a href="Marathi%20literature">Marathi</a> devotional poems of the Varkaris, and many "<a href="stuti">stuti</a>s" (songs of praise) and "<a href="stotra">stotra</a>s" (hymns), some of them originating from the Haridasa tradition. The best known of these is "Pandurangastaka" or "Pandurangastrotra", attributed to <a href="Adi%20Shankara">Adi Shankara</a>charya, although this attribution is questioned. A text called "Tirthavali-Gatha", attributed to Namdev or Dnyaneshwar but possibly a collection of writings of many poet-saints, also centers on the propagation of Varkari faith and Vithoba worship. Other devotional works include "aratis" like "Yuge atthavisa vitevari ubha" by Namdev and "Yei O Vitthala maje mauli re". These "aratis" sing of Vithoba, who wears yellow garments (a characteristic of Vishnu) and is served by <a href="Garuda">Garuda</a> (<a href="vahana">mount</a> of Vishnu) and <a href="Hanuman">Hanuman</a> (the monkey god, devotee of <a href="Rama">Rama</a>—an avatar of Vishnu). Finally, the <a href="Telugu%20language">Telugu</a> poet <a href="Tenali%20Ramakrishna">Tenali Ramakrishna</a> (16th century) refers to Vithoba, as Panduranga, in his poem "Panduranga-Mahatmyamu": "(O <a href="Parvati">Parvati</a>), accepting the services of Pundarika and Kshetrapala (Kala-<a href="bhairava">bhairava</a>), becoming <a href="Kalpataru">the wish fulfilling tree</a> by assuming a subtle body for the sake of devotees, fulfilling their wishes, the deity Panduranga resides in that temple."

There are many Vithoba temples in Maharashtra, and some in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Goa and Andhra Pradesh. However, the main centre of worship is Vithoba's temple in Pandharpur. The temple's date of establishment is disputed, though it is clear that it was standing at the time of Dnyaneshwar in the 13th century. Along with Vithoba and his consorts—Rukmini, Satyabhama and Radha—other Vaishnava deities are worshipped. These include: <a href="Venkateshwara">Venkateshwara</a>, a form of Vishnu; Mahalakshmi, a form of Vishnu's consort <a href="Lakshmi">Lakshmi</a>; Garuda and Hanuman (see previous section). Shaiva deities are also worshipped, such as: <a href="Ganesha">Ganesha</a>, the elephant-headed god of wisdom and beginnings; <a href="Khandoba">Khandoba</a>, a form of Shiva; and <a href="Annapurna">Annapurna</a>, a form of Shiva's consort <a href="Parvati">Parvati</a>. The "<a href="samadhi">samadhi</a>s" (memorials) of saints like Namdev, <a href="Chokhamela">Chokhamela</a> and <a href="Janabai">Janabai</a>, and of devotees such as Pundalik and <a href="Kanhopatra">Kanhopatra</a>, are in and around the temple. Other significant temples in Maharashtra are located: at Dehu, the birthplace of Tukaram, which attracts visitors at all <a href="ekadashi">ekadashi</a>s of the year; at Kole (<a href="Satara%20district">Satara district</a>), in memory of Ghadge Bova, which has a fair on the fifth day of the bright fortnight (waxing moon) in <a href="Maagha">Magha</a> month; at <a href="Kolhapur">Kolhapur</a> and <a href="Rajapur%2C%20Maharashtra">Rajapur</a>, which host fairs on Shayani Ekadashi and Prabodini Ekadashi; Madhe — a refuge of the Pandharpur image when it was moved to protect from Muslim invaders and finally at the <a href="Birla%20Mandir%2C%20Shahad">Birla Mandir</a> in <a href="Shahad">Shahad</a>.

Several temples are found in Goa, the well-known ones being the temples at <a href="Sanquelim">Sanquelim</a>, <a href="Sanguem">Sanguem</a> and <a href="Gokarna%20Math">Gokarna Math</a>. Similarly temple festivals celebrated in Vitthala temples in <a href="Margao">Margao</a>, <a href="Ponda%2C%20Goa">Ponda</a> attract a lot a pilgrims. Vitthal is also worshipped as "Vitthalnath" at the <a href="Nathdwara">Nathdwara</a> in <a href="Rajasthan">Rajasthan</a>.
Vithoba was introduced to South India during the Vijayanagara and Maratha rule. In South India he is generally known as Vitthala. The Hampi temple (mentioned above) is a <a href="World%20Heritage%20site">World Heritage site</a> and the most important of Vitthala's temples outside Maharashtra. Constructed in the 15th century, the temple is believed to have housed the central image from Pandharpur, which the Vijayanagara king Krishnadevaraya took "to enhance his own status" or to save the image from plunder by <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> invaders. It was later returned to Pandharpur by Bhanudas (1448–1513), the great-grandfather of poet-saint Eknath. Today, the temple stands without a central image, though between 1516 and 1565, most important transactions, which would have been carried out previously in the presence of the original state deity <a href="Virupaksha%20Temple%2C%20Hampi">Virupaksha</a> (a form of Shiva), were issued in presence of the central image of Vitthala. Three of <a href="Madhvacharya">Madhvacharya</a>'s <a href="Ashta%20Mathas%20of%20Udupi">eight "matha"s (monasteries)</a> in Karnataka—<a href="Shiroor">Shirur</a>, <a href="Pejavara">Pejavara</a> and <a href="Puthige%2C%20Dakshina%20Kannada">Puttige</a>—have Vitthala as their presiding deity. A "Vitthaleshwara temple" stands at <a href="Mulbagal">Mulbagal</a>, Karnataka. In Tamil Nadu, Vitthala shrines are found in <a href="Srirangam">Srirangam</a>, Vittalapuram near thiruporur and in <a href="Tirunelveli%20district">Tirunelveli district</a>, and <a href="Thennangur">Thennangur</a>, <a href="Govindapuram%2C%20Thanjavur%20district">Govindapuram</a> near <a href="Kumbakonam">Kumbakonam</a> and sculptures are also found in <a href="Kanchi">Kanchi</a>.

Sree Vithoba temple is one of the important and ancient temples in Kayamkulam, Kerala. This temple is situated near the Kayamkulam market. Locally the temple is known as ‘Konkani’ temple. The main deity in this temple is Sree Vittala or Vithoba. Sree Vithoba is revered as the ‘nada moorthy’ and is fond of bhajans than other ‘pooja's. This temple claims a history of over 400 years and is well associated with the GSB community in and around the Kayamkulam region. This temple is believed to be constructed in the early 18th century with the help of the King of Kayamkulam. The temple complex consists of the sanctum sanctorum (Sreekovil) and inner temple, flag post (dwajam), temple pond, chariot location, Lord Siva shrine, Naga shine and Vithobaji and althara. There are a lot of myths and stories related to this temple. It is one of the rare temples of god Vithoba. In this temple there are two festivals celebrated annually with the ninth day chariot festival (Ratholsavam) as the important attraction. There is a secondary school near the temple that is run by the temple trust.

Legends regarding Vithoba usually focus on his devotee Pundalik or on Vithoba's role as a savior to the poet-saints of the Varkari faith. As discussed in the <a href="%23Devotional%20works">devotional works</a> section above, the Pundalik legend appears in the Sanskrit scriptures <a href="Skanda%20Purana">Skanda Purana</a> and <a href="Padma%20Purana">Padma Purana</a>. It is also documented in Marathi texts: "Panduranga-Mahatmya" by a Brahmin called Sridhara; another work of the same name written by Prahlada Maharaj; and also in the "abhanga"s of various poet-saints.

There are three versions of the Pundalik legend, two of which are attested as textual variants of the Skanda Purana (1.34–67). According to the first, the ascetic Pundarika (Pundalik) is described as a devotee of god Vishnu and dedicated to the service of his parents. The god <a href="Gopal%20%28Krishna%29">Gopala</a>-Krishna, a form of Vishnu, comes from <a href="Govardhan%20hill">Govardhana</a> as a cowherd, accompanied by his grazing cows, to meet Pundarika. Krishna is described as in "digambar" form, wearing "makara-kundala", the "srivatsa" mark (described above), a head-dress of peacock feathers, resting his hands on his waist and keeping his cow-stick between his thighs. Pundarika asks Krishna to remain in this form on the banks of the river Bhima. He believes that Krishna's presence will make the site a <a href="Tirtha%20and%20Kshetra">"tirtha" and a "kshetra"</a>. The location is identified with modern-day Pandharpur, which is situated on the banks of the Bhima. The description of Krishna resembles the characteristics of the Pandharpur image of Vithoba.

The second version of the legend depicts Vithoba appearing before Pundalik as the five-year-old <a href="Bala%20Krishna">Bala Krishna</a> (infant Krishna). This version is found in manuscripts of both Puranas, Prahlada Maharaj, and the poet-saints, notably Tukaram. The remaining version of the Pundalik legend appears in Sridhara and as a variant in the Padma Purana. Pundalik, a Brahmin madly in love with his wife, neglected his aged parents as a result. Later, on meeting sage Kukkuta, Pundalik underwent a transformation and devoted his life to the service of his aged parents. Meanwhile, Radha, the milkmaid-lover of Krishna, came to <a href="Dwarka">Dwarka</a>, the kingdom of Krishna, and sat on his lap. Radha did not honour Rukmini, the chief queen of Krishna, nor did Krishna hold Radha accountable for the offence. Offended, Rukmini left Krishna and went to the forest of Dandivana near Pandharpur. Saddened by Rukmini's departure, Krishna searched for his queen and finally found her resting in Dandivana, near Pundalik's house. After some coaxing, Rukmini was pacified. Then Krishna visited Pundalik and found him serving his parents. Pundalik threw a brick outside for Krishna to rest on. Krishna stood on the brick and waited for Pundalik. After completing his services, Pundalik asked that his Lord, in Vithoba form, remain on the brick with Rukmini, in Rakhumai form, and bless His devotees forever.

Other legends describe Vithoba coming to the rescue of his devotees in the form of a commoner, an outcast <a href="Mahar">Mahar</a> "untouchable" or a Brahmin beggar. <a href="Mahipati">Mahipati</a>, in his work "Pandurangastrotra", narrates how Vithoba helped female saints like Janabai in their daily chores, such as sweeping the house and pounding the rice. He narrates how Vithoba came to the aid of Sena the barber. The king of <a href="Bidar">Bidar</a> had ordered Sena to be arrested for not coming to the palace despite royal orders. As Sena was engrossed in his prayers to Vithoba, Vithoba went to the palace in the form of Sena to serve the king, and Sena was saved. Another tale deals with a saint, <a href="Damaji">Damaji</a>, the keeper of the royal grain store, who distributed grain to the people in famine. Vithoba came as an outcaste with a bag of gold to pay for the grain. Yet another story narrates how Vithoba resurrected the child of Gora Kumbara (potter), who had been trampled into the clay by Gora while singing the name of Vithoba.

3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines

3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines, abbreviated as (3/3), is an <a href="infantry">infantry</a> <a href="battalion">battalion</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States Marine Corps</a>, based out of <a href="K%C4%81ne%27ohe%2C%20Hawai%27i">Kāne'ohe, Hawai'i</a>. Known as either "Trinity" or "America's Battalion", the unit falls under the command of the <a href="3rd%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">3rd Marine Regiment</a> of the <a href="3rd%20Marine%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">3rd Marine Division</a>. The unit consists of approximately 1124 U.S. Marines and <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> sailors.

The battalion was originally formed at <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Base%20Camp%20Lejeune">Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune</a>, <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> in 1942 and saw action on both <a href="Bougainville%20campaign">Bougainville</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Guam%20%281944%29">Guam</a> during World War II, where it was awarded the first of its <a href="Presidential%20Unit%20Citation%20%28United%20States%29">Presidential Unit Citations</a> for "gallantry, determination, and <a href="Morale">esprit de corps</a> in accomplishing its mission under extremely difficult and hazardous conditions"; and the first of its <a href="Navy%20Unit%20Commendation">Navy Unit Commendation</a>s for "outstanding service". Marines in the battalion were also awarded one <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medal of Honor</a> and seven <a href="Navy%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Navy Cross</a>es during the war.

Following World War II, 3rd Battalion was disbanded until 1951, when it was reformed in California. The battalion was alerted for possible deployment during the 1956 <a href="Suez%20War">Suez War</a> and the 1958 intervention in Lebanon. In 1965, the Marines of 3rd Battalion were deployed to the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> and participated in <a href="Operation%20Starlite">Operation Starlite</a>, the first major Marine engagement of that conflict. The battalion continued to see major action through Vietnam and was rotated back to the United States in 1969. Famous alumni from its time in Vietnam include Corporal <a href="Robert%20Emmett%20O%27Malley">Robert Emmett O'Malley</a>, the first Marine in Vietnam to be awarded the Medal of Honor, <a href="Oliver%20North">Oliver North</a>, and <a href="John%20Ripley%20%28USMC%29">John Ripley</a>. Around the end of the Vietnam War, the Battalion was deactivated for a second time in 1974.

In 1975, 3rd Battalion was reformed for the third (and last) time at <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Base%20Hawaii">Marine Corps Base Hawaii</a>. During this period, the battalion conducted numerous deployments in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. In 1983, 3rd Battalion deployed off the coast of Lebanon for several weeks during a particularly tense period in the <a href="Lebanese%20Civil%20War">civil war</a>. During the 1980s, the battalion was briefly commanded by <a href="Charles%20Krulak">Charles Krulak</a>, later the 31st <a href="Commandant%20of%20the%20Marine%20Corps">Commandant of the Marine Corps</a>, who nicknamed 3rd Battalion 3rd Marines "America's Battalion" because it was similar to the nickname used by the <a href="Dallas%20Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a>. 3rd Battalion deployed again in 1990 as part of <a href="Operation%20Desert%20Storm">Operation Desert Shield</a> and saw action at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Khafji">Battle of Khafji</a> and again during the liberation of Kuwait. In the early 21st century the battalion deployed overseas six times as part of the <a href="War%20on%20Terror">Global War on Terror</a>: three times for <a href="Operation%20Enduring%20Freedom">Operation Enduring Freedom</a> in Afghanistan and three times for <a href="Operation%20Iraqi%20Freedom">Operation Iraqi Freedom</a> in Iraq. One Marine from the battalion, <a href="Dakota%20Meyer">Dakota Meyer</a>, was awarded the Medal of Honor during the Global War on Terror.


Like many infantry battalions in the Marine Corps, 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines consists of five companies: three <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29%23Marine%20Corps">Rifle Companies</a>, a <a href="Headquarters%20and%20Service%20Company">Headquarters and Service Company</a> (H&S), and a <a href="Weapons%20company">Weapons Company</a>. The rifle companies are designed to act as maneuver elements for the battalion. With attachments they can also be employed independently for short periods of time. Each rifle company ideally consists of six officers and 176 enlisted personnel and is typically commanded by a Captain who is assisted by a <a href="First%20Sergeant%23Marine%20Corps">First Sergeant</a>. The three rifle companies in 3rd Battalion have traditionally been I Company, K Company, and L Company. Because the Marine Corps uses the <a href="NATO%20phonetic%20alphabet">NATO phonetic alphabet</a>, these companies are commonly known as India, Kilo, and Lima. Prior to 1956, under the <a href="Joint%20Army/Navy%20Phonetic%20Alphabet">Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet</a>, they were known as Item, King, and Love. H&S Company provides combat service support and consists of the <a href="Staff%20%28military%29">battalion staff</a>, including the headquarters element, communications, medical, and service platoons. While not a combat unit itself, H&S provides the battalion with command and control, surveillance, target acquisition, and service support, making the battalion able to function independently without the direct involvement of a higher headquarters. Weapons Company provides fire support coordination, <a href="Mortar%20%28weapon%29">medium mortars</a>, <a href="anti-armor">anti-armor</a> weapons, and <a href="heavy%20machine%20gun">heavy machine gun</a> support for the rifle companies. Generally, these elements of Weapons Company are directly employed by the battalion, but may also be attached to the rifle companies.

3rd Battalion 3rd Marines was activated on 1 June 1942 at <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Air%20Station%20New%20River">New River, North Carolina</a> as the 5th Training Battalion, Division Special Troops, 1st Marine Division, <a href="Fleet%20Marine%20Force">Fleet Marine Force</a>. On 16 June, they were redesignated as the 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines, Fleet Marine Force. From August to September 1942, 3rd Battalion deployed with the rest of the 3rd Marine Regiment to <a href="American%20Samoa">Tutuila, American Samoa</a> and was reassigned to the <a href="2nd%20Marine%20Brigade">2nd Marine Brigade</a>. In 1943, they were reassigned to the Fleet Marine Force. In May 1943, they redeployed to <a href="Auckland">Auckland</a>, New Zealand and in June, were reassigned to the <a href="3rd%20Marine%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">3rd Marine Division</a>. From July to August 1943, they redeployed to the island of <a href="Guadalcanal">Guadalcanal</a> to begin training in preparation for the <a href="Bougainville%20campaign">invasion of Bougainville</a> in November.

On 1 November 1943, the 3rd Battalion landed at <a href="Landings%20at%20Cape%20Torokina">Cape Torokina</a> with the rest of 3rd Marines, just east of the Koromokina River. While resistance was extremely light, the rough surf and dense jungle (which in many places extended all the way to the water) resulted in numerous landing craft being lost or damaged beyond repair. For the next two weeks, the battalion helped construct a series of trails that linked the beachhead with the advancing units, and made supply much easier. On 16 November the battalion reached the Numa Numa Trail and began probing for Japanese units On 18 November after a sharp firefight near a Japanese roadblock the battalion recovered a Japanese map with valuable intelligence on Japanese defenses. From 19–21 November 3rd Battalion continued probing for Japanese units, which had been identified as elements of the 23rd Infantry Regiment, and engaging in sporadic firefights. In the lead-up to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Piva%20Forks">Battle of Piva Forks</a>, 3rd Battalion was able to seize critical high terrain that would give the Marines the advantage in the upcoming fight. The actual battle, from 22–26 November, saw some of the most vicious close combat experienced in the Pacific War as of that date. 3rd Battalion additionally suffered many casualties from unusually accurate Japanese mortar and artillery fire. Two days later, after 27 days of continuous action, 3rd Battalion was moved to a relatively quiet sector on the 3rd Division's flank where it remained for the remainder of the operation.

In December, the 3rd Marine Division was relieved by the <a href="United%20States%20Army">Army's</a> <a href="Americal%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">Americal Division</a> and 3rd Battalion left Bougainville for Guadalcanal on Christmas Day, 1943 with the rest of the division. They left behind 36 of their comrades, including Corporal John Logan Jr. and Captain Robert Turnbull (Lima Company), who were both awarded Navy Crosses during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Piva%20Forks">Battle of Piva Forks</a>. 165 other Marines from 3rd Battalion became casualties during the campaign. After Bougainville, 3rd Battalion conducted numerous training exercises on Guadalcanal from January to May 1944 in preparation for the invasion of <a href="Kavieng">Kavieng</a> in April (which was cancelled) and the <a href="Marianas">Marianas</a> in June. While 3rd Marines was designated as the floating reserve for the initial <a href="Battle%20of%20Saipan">invasion of Saipan</a>, they were ultimately not landed and returned to <a href="Eniwetok">Eniwetok</a> for a three-week stay prior to the invasion of <a href="Guam">Guam</a>. During the interlude, the Marines of 3rd Battalion were primarily confined to their transport ship, the "<a href="USS%20Warren%20%28APA-53%29">USS Warren</a>".

On 21 July 1944, around 0830, 3rd Battalion hit the <a href="Asan%2C%20Guam">Asan</a> beaches on <a href="Guam">Guam</a>. Landing on the extreme left of the entire 3rd Marine Division, their mission was to take Chonito Cliff and <a href="Adelup">Adelup Point</a>, which marked the left flank of the division. Within minutes the Japanese defenders opened up with mortars and machine guns, hitting many 3rd Battalion Marines coming ashore. By 0912 battalion commander Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Ralph%20Houser">Ralph Houser</a> reported many casualties caused by both mortars and sniper fire. Both Kilo and India Companies rushed the Chonito Cliffs but the Japanese defenders (Elements of the 2d Battalion, 18th Regiment and 320th Independent Infantry Battalion) resisted strongly, in some cases rolling grenades down the hillside. Supported by <a href="flamethrower">flamethrower</a>s, <a href="half-tracks">half-tracks</a>, and armor from the <a href="3rd%20Tank%20Battalion">3rd Tank Battalion</a>, 3rd Battalion fought a bloody, three-hour battle up the side of Chonito Cliff. Houser then ordered Lima Company to flank the cliffs to the north by dashing down an exposed beach road. Having secured Chonito Cliff, the battalion then moved on to Adelup Point. The US Navy sent a <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> to blast the Japanese caves at point-blank range and 3rd Battalion flamethrowers burned out Japanese soldiers who still remained. After securing Adelup Point, 3rd Battalion finished the day providing flank security for the rest of the 3rd Marines during the Battle for Bundschu Ridge and became the only unit in the regiment to accomplish its objectives by the end of W-Day.

The first night of 21–22 July, the Marines of 3rd Battalion came under a concerted counterattack by the survivors of the Japanese 320th Independent Infantry Battalion, as well as the 319th, committed by Japanese commander General Kiyoshi Shigematsu to retake the Chonito Cliffs. The Japanese managed to infiltrate past many 3rd Battalion units through ravines and dry river beds and briefly threatened to overrun the battalion command post. The fighting was so heavy that parts of the Division Reserve were committed and the destroyer "<a href="USS%20McKee%20%28DD-575%29">USS McKee</a>" was unable to provide close fire support, as the Japanese and Marines were so closely intermingled. However the Marines held firm and managed to repulse the attack by 0830. During the counterattack, a mortarman with Kilo Company, <a href="Private%20First%20Class">Private First Class</a> <a href="Luther%20Skaggs%2C%20Jr.">Luther Skaggs, Jr.</a>, was critically wounded in the leg by a Japanese grenade. After applying a <a href="tourniquet">tourniquet</a>, Skaggs continued to fight for another eight hours before moving unassisted to the rear where most of his leg was amputated. For this he became the first Marine from 3rd Battalion to be awarded the <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medal of Honor</a>. Over the next two days the 3rd Battalion fought a savage battle with the Japanese defenders for the Chonito Cliffs and Fonte Plateau area, as the battalion struggled to capture the Mt. Tenjo Road. On 23 July, 3rd Battalion seized the last ridge leading to the Fonte Plateau, provoking a heavy Japanese counterattack. LtCol Houser himself was seriously wounded in this engagement and the <a href="Executive%20Officer">Executive Officer</a>, Major Royal Bastian, took command. Then 3rd Battalion, now reinforced with tanks, took part in the assault on the Fonte Plateau on 25 July, seizing the key position after just an hour of fighting. The night of 25–26 July saw the climax of the fighting on Guam when the Japanese launched an all-out counterattack against the Americans. In the 3rd Battalion's sector, Japanese sailors of the 54th Keibitai launched a series of failed attacks against the now-well defended Marine positions. Backed up with artillery, the Marines easily repulsed the Japanese.
On the morning of 31 July, 3rd Battalion proceeded east on the Mt. Tenjo road towards the island capital of <a href="Agana">Agana</a>, which it liberated the same day after token resistance. By 1045, 15 minutes after its platoons entered the city, 3rd Battalion had reached the central plaza and stopped at the northern outskirts by noon. Resuming the offensive at 1545, 3rd Battalion pushed forward 1,500 yards to seize key road junctions that led to the towns of <a href="Finegayan">Finegayan</a> and <a href="Barrigada">Barrigada</a>. For the remaining ten days of the campaign, the battalion marched northeast up the coast, encountering occasional Japanese resistance, until the island was declared secure on 10 August. However, the Japanese were not totally defeated. On 7 August, as 3rd Battalion led the regimental advance towards Road Junction 460, Japanese artillery shells began landing among the advancing Marines. After Marines discovered the source of fire, a 75mm artillery piece, the Japanese fled. The final action by 3rd Battalion during the campaign was on 9 August when a nearby battalion came under heavy Japanese tank and infantry attack. Blazing a trail through the jungle, 3rd Battalion rushed towards the action but the Japanese tanks vanished before the battalion could arrive. Casualties for the 3rd Battalion were twice that of Bougainville, with 300 wounded and 97 killed.

Following the invasion of Guam, 3rd Battalion spent two months conducting 'mopping up' operations on the island until November, when it received orders to prepare for operations against Iwo Jima. From November until February 1945, they took part in a training regimen so serious that a fellow battalion later reported at least 20% of its members were incapacitated due to foot and heat injuries. During the <a href="Battle%20of%20Iwo%20Jima">Battle of Iwo Jima</a>, 3rd Battalion, as part of 3rd Marines, was kept offshore as the Expeditionary Troops reserve. However, despite numerous requests from other Marine officers, the 3rd Marines were never landed. According to one 3rd Battalion veteran, some Marines from the battalion came ashore to unload supplies or with other units that they had recently transferred to. After sitting off Iwo Jima in their transport ships for a month, the 3rd Marines were ordered to return to Guam on 5 March 1945.

Back on Guam, 3rd Battalion began training for a landing on <a href="Miyako%20Jima">Miyako Jima</a>, an island just south of <a href="Okinawa">Okinawa</a>. Those orders were eventually cancelled, but the battalion still saw minor combat in 1945, participating in two operations on Guam designed to capture Japanese soldiers still holding out in the hills. These sweeps took place in April and December 1945. 3rd Battalion also began preparing for <a href="Operation%20Downfall">Operation Olympic</a>, where as part of <a href="V%20Amphibious%20Corps">V Amphibious Corps</a>, it would have landed at <a href="Kushikino%2C%20Kagoshima">Kushikino, Kagoshima</a> on <a href="Ky%C5%ABsh%C5%AB">Kyūshū</a>. After the <a href="Atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">dropping of the atomic bombs in August 1945</a>, and <a href="Surrender%20of%20Japan">Japan's surrender</a>, 3rd Battalion was detached from the 3rd Marine Division in November 1945 and deactivated the following month on 20 December 1945. Shortly before it was deactivated, however, 3rd Battalion suffered the dubious honor of having the last American killed in World War II, when PFC W.C. Patrick Bates of Kilo Company was shot by a Japanese sniper on 14 December during a mopping up operation on Guam (three months after the formal end of hostilities).

3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines was reactivated at <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Base%20Camp%20Pendleton">Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton</a> in August 1951 as part of the 3rd Marine Brigade. In February 1952, it took part in Lex-Baker-1, which was the first full-scale Marine-Navy exercise held on the <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast</a> since 1949. In May, India Company participated in the ground portion of the <a href="Operation%20Tumbler%E2%80%93Snapper">Operation Tumbler–Snapper</a> atomic bomb tests in Nevada. In August, part of the battalion took part in an amphibious landing on <a href="Lake%20Washington">Lake Washington</a> as part of <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>'s "<a href="Seafair">Seafair</a>." Then in December, 3rd Battalion took part in one of the first exercises at <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Air%20Ground%20Combat%20Center%20Twentynine%20Palms">Twentynine Palms</a>, California. The entire 3rd Marine Division, including 3rd Battalion 3rd Marines, was transported more than by truck between MCB Camp Pendleton and Twenty-nine Palms. During the exercise, Third Battalion made a night airlift using over 60 helicopters.

In January 1953, the unit deployed to the <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Air%20Station%20Kaneohe%20Bay">Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay</a> on <a href="Oahu">Oahu</a> for six months of training, after which 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines returned to Pendleton. In August 1953, 3rd Battalion deployed to Japan for training operations at Kin Beach, <a href="Okinawa">Okinawa</a> and Iwo Jima. In October 1956, 3rd Battalion was stationed in Japan when the <a href="Suez%20Crisis">Suez Crisis</a> broke out. Though initially deployed to the Indian Ocean for possible action in Egypt and the surrounding region, the crisis was ultimately resolved. During this cruise, 3rd Battalion—designated Battalion Landing Team (BLT) 3/3 – visited <a href="Brunei%20Bay">Brunei Bay</a>, <a href="Bombay">Bombay</a>, <a href="Karachi">Karachi</a>, and Singapore, before returning to Japan. In December 1956, the entire 3rd Marine Regiment was deployed off of Indonesia because of civil strife in that country. In 1958, 3rd Battalion was alerted for possible deployment to Lebanon, but its transports were turned back in the Indian Ocean to Okinawa. Four years later, in 1962, the battalion deployed on the "<a href="USS%20Bayfield">USS Bayfield</a>" to the Chinese coast to guard the Taiwanese islands of <a href="Kinmen">Quemoy</a> <a href="Matsu%20Islands">Matsu</a>.

In January 1965, the <a href="2nd%20Battalion%2C%201st%20Marines">2nd Battalion, 1st Marines</a> at <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Base%20Camp%20Pendleton">Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton</a>, California deployed for a tour on <a href="Okinawa">Okinawa</a>, Japan, where they were redesignated the 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines. At the time the Marines of 3rd Battalion expected a typical 13-month deployment followed by a quick return to the States. However the battalion found itself caught up in the initial deployment of Marine units to Vietnam, and landed on 12 May along the coast south of <a href="Danang">Danang</a> at <a href="Chu%20Lai">Chu Lai</a>. The battalion's first major operation in the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> was <a href="Operation%20Starlite">Operation Starlite</a> where they teamed up with units of the <a href="7th%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">7th Marines</a>. Operation Starlite was aimed at destroying the 1st <a href="Viet%20Cong">Viet Cong</a> (VC) Regiment, which was preparing to attack Chu Lai from the Van Tuong peninsula. The fighting began on 18 August when the battalion conducted an amphibious landing just east of the VC positions. At first the attack was slowed by effective VC delaying tactics. However, 3rd Battalion eventually advanced to the outskirts of the village of An Cuong 2. While attempting to clear the village, India Company came under intense fire from VC defending the village. When one squad under Corporal <a href="Robert%20Emmett%20O%27Malley">Robert Emmett O'Malley</a> was ambushed, O'Malley jumped into a VC trench and personally killed eight Viet Cong. Wounded three times, O'Malley refused to be evacuated until all his men were safe and was later awarded the <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medal of Honor</a>. India Company then had to fight its way back to the rest of the battalion through other Viet Cong units still operating in the area. Around 1200, an <a href="Headquarters%20and%20Service%20Company">H&S Company</a> supply convoy bound for India Company was ambushed and a force sent to relieve them was also pinned down. The ordeal was covered by journalist <a href="Peter%20Arnett">Peter Arnett</a> in his article "The Death of Supply Column 21". During the afternoon the situation was stabilized and the Viet Cong retreated that night, resulting in a tactical American victory. The United States had 52 Marines killed in Starlite. India Company lost 14 dead, including the company commander, and 53 wounded out of a force of 177 Marines. Three <a href="Navy%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Navy Cross</a>es were awarded to Marines from the battalion for actions during Starlite, including the battalion commander Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Muir.

Following Starlite 3rd Battalion continued to conduct regular sweeps and low-level (i.e. small unit) combat operations against the Viet Cong (usually the 1st VC Regiment) in the greater Da Nang area. Among the casualties suffered during this period was LtCol Muir, who was killed when he stepped on an <a href="Improvised%20explosive%20device">IED</a>. In November they participated in an amphibious operation similar to Starlite called <a href="Operation%20Blue%20Marlin">Blue Marlin (II)</a>, which was carried out near <a href="Hoi%20An">Hoi An</a>. Contact was irregular as the VC attempted to avoid a drawn-out engagement and the battalion only had three Marines wounded. Then in December the battalion moved to the <a href="Que%20Son%20Valley">Que Son Valley</a> for <a href="Operation%20Harvest%20Moon">Operation Harvest Moon</a>, preventing the VC from capturing the town. In March 1966, 3rd Battalion participated in <a href="Operation%20Kings">Operation Kings</a>, officially a search and destroy mission in the An Hoa region, but really an attempt to create a long-term occupation in a historic Viet Cong stronghold. However, any progress gained in Kings was immediately negated by the <a href="Buddhist%20Uprising">Buddhist Uprising</a> just one week later in Da Nang. In July, the battalion acted as a blocking force during <a href="Operation%20Macon">Operation Macon</a> but did not see significant action. In August, 3rd Battalion left Vietnam for Okinawa. The battalion would not be gone long though, and in early October was stationed offshore as BLT 3/3 near the northern portion of <a href="I%20Corps%20%28South%20Vietnam%29">I Corps</a> to combat a possible North Vietnamese invasion across the <a href="Vietnamese%20Demilitarized%20Zone">Demilitarized Zone</a> (DMZ). The threat never materialized and BLT 3/3 returned to Vietnam later that month.

In October 1966, 3rd Battalion was deployed to combat the threat from the <a href="People%27s%20Army%20of%20Vietnam">People's Army of Vietnam</a> (PAVN) in <a href="Qu%E1%BA%A3ng%20Tr%E1%BB%8B%20Province">Quảng Trị Province</a>. This would be a largely conventional fight, known as the "war against professionals", that would continue until late 1968. Supplies would be in constant short supply and Marines were constantly scavenging helmets, clothes, armor, and ammunition from their dead. In December, the battalion suffered a tragic case of friendly fire when a pair of <a href="F-4%20Phantom%20II">F-4 Phantoms</a> dropped several bombs in the middle of Mike Company, killing seventeen Marines and wounding a dozen others. Navy Corpsman Donald Rion was awarded a posthumous <a href="Silver%20Star">Silver Star</a> for his efforts to treat the wounded, despite suffering a mortal wound himself. From February – April, the battalion took part in Operations <a href="Operation%20Prairie%20II">Prairie II</a>, <a href="Operation%20Prairie%20III">III</a> and <a href="Operation%20Prairie%20IV">IV</a>, which were a series of sweeps throughout Quảng Trị Province. On 2 March 1967, Lima Company, then under the command of Captain <a href="John%20Ripley%20%28USMC%29">John Ripley</a>, stumbled into a PAVN regiment trying to cross the DMZ. 12 Marines were killed, 28 severely wounded, and nearly every other man in the fight, including Ripley, was hit. The PAVN suffered heavy casualties and retreated across the border.

In April, 3rd Battalion participated in a series of bloody engagements near <a href="Khe%20Sanh">Khe Sanh</a> known as <a href="The%20Hill%20Fights">The Hill Fights</a>. Activity near Khe Sanh had increased dramatically that spring and on 24 April, Bravo Company <a href="1st%20Battalion%209th%20Marines">1st Battalion 9th Marines</a> was engaged by elements of the PAVN 18th Regiment dug in on Hills 881 North, 881 South, and 861. 3rd Battalion, then a hybrid unit with companies from multiple battalions, was sent to assist. 3rd Battalion's commander, LtCol Gary Wilder, believed he was only facing a small PAVN unit and counterattacked. Throughout the 25th, 3rd Battalion launched a series of piecemeal attacks on the hills, only to be repulsed with heavy losses. The 3rd Marine Division committed its reserve to the fighting and took Hill 861 on 26 April. On the night of 29 April, the PAVN replaced the battered 18th Regiment with the fresh 95th Regiment. The following day the Marines dropped 250 bombs and more than 1300 artillery rounds on Hill 881. Mike Company was allowed by the PAVN to advance partially up the hill before opening fire. By the end of the battle, 46 Marines from the battalion were killed, half of them from Mike Company.

Throughout the late spring and early summer of 1967 the battalion helped keep open <a href="National%20Road%209%20%28Vietnam%29">Route 9</a>, the supply route between <a href="Ca%20Lu%20Combat%20Base">Ca Lu Combat Base</a> and Khe Sanh. After a firefight between a PAVN battalion and Mike Company in late July, the road was closed until 1968. The battalion was also stricken by <a href="malaria">malaria</a> during this time; 206 3rd Battalion Marines contracted it. In the fall the battalion was put to work building and defending the <a href="McNamara%20Line">McNamara Line</a>, a series of fixed fortifications along the DMZ in an area known as <a href="Leatherneck%20Square">Leatherneck Square</a> (The four corners were <a href="Cam%20L%E1%BB%99%20Combat%20Base">Cam Lộ</a>, <a href="Con%20Thien">Con Thien</a>, <a href="Firebase%20Gio%20Linh">Gio Linh</a> and <a href="%C4%90%C3%B4ng%20H%C3%A0%20Combat%20Base">Đông Hà</a>). The PAVN repeatedly attacked the positions and twice 3rd Battalion had to come rescue elements of <a href="2nd%20Battalion%2C%204th%20Marines">2nd Battalion, 4th Marines</a> that were in danger of being overrun. 3rd Battalion would occupy several of those positions through May 1968. From 29 December to 12 January elements of the battalion participated in the construction and defense of strongpoint Alpha 3.

The first major combat for 3rd Battalion in 1968 came on 7 February, about a week after the <a href="Tet%20Offensive">Tet Offensive</a> began, when Kilo Company engaged a PAVN battalion near Gio Linh. 29 Kilo Marines were killed, including PFC Robert Quick who was awarded a posthumous Navy Cross for deflecting a PAVN hand grenade. Another 31 were wounded, including PFC Craig Swartz who was wounded three times and received three purple hearts for his service. PAVN losses numbered at least 139, with another 60 graves discovered by 3rd Battalion Marines three days later. That same month a platoon from Mike Company observed and damaged two PAVN <a href="PT-76">PT-76</a> tanks near Alpha 3, one of only three times they were encountered during the Vietnam War before 1972. On 6 March, Mike Company blundered into the 27th Regiment of the PAVN <a href="325th%20Division%20%28Vietnam%29">325th Division</a> and had one-third of the company put out of action in an all-night engagement, including 14 Marines killed.

In early May the PAVN launched a new offensive known as the <a href="May%20Offensive">May Offensive</a> or 'mini-Tet'. During that time, on 8 May, 3rd Battalion overran a PAVN regimental command post in Leatherneck Square, suffering 102 casualties including 8 killed. On 22 May, Lima Company uncovered a North Vietnamese staging area near Alpha 3 and destroyed it in an action that involved elements of three other Marine battalions. Then on 26 May the battalion was moved east to Dai Do as part of <a href="Operation%20Napoleon/Saline">Operation Napoleon/Saline</a>, in response to PAVN pressure on the supply lines to the 3rd Marine Division headquarters at Dong Ha. By the end of the month, 3rd Battalion had lost 53 Marines and had another 319 severely wounded, a casualty ratio of about one out of every two infantrymen in the field.

In June the battalion was placed in reserve as a ready-reinforcement unit and consequently saw little combat. From July to September, 3rd Battalion operated all throughout the I Corps area of operations, moving its command post to ten different locations. Hundreds of Marines were also affected by <a href="cellulitis">cellulitis</a>. Following President Johnson's halt of the US bombing campaign on 1 November, 3rd Battalion Marines had to watch as the PAVN brazenly pushed large convoys of men and munitions south along the Ben Hai River. In one instance it took three days for the battalion to get approval for a single airstrike on a North Vietnamese convoy.

In early 1969, 3rd Battalion 3rd Marines was sent south of the DMZ for several months to join Task Force Yankee in <a href="Operation%20Taylor%20Common">Operation Taylor Common</a> near <a href="An%20Hoa">An Hoa</a>. This three-month operation focused on destroying the primary base for PAVN forces operating across several provinces and 3rd Battalion was awarded a <a href="Navy%20Unit%20Commendation">Navy Unit Commendation</a> for its actions during the operation. Ten Marines from 3rd Battalion were killed during the operation (out of 183 total US fatalities), and American forces captured numerous quantities of PAVN supplies. One Marine, <a href="Lance%20Corporal">Lance Corporal</a> (LCPL) <a href="William%20R.%20Prom">William R. Prom</a>, was posthumously awarded the <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medal of Honor</a> for gallantry during Taylor Common.

In July 1969, the battalion took part in Operations <a href="Operation%20Virginia%20Ridge">Virginia Ridge</a> and <a href="Operation%20Idaho%20Canyon">Idaho Canyon</a>, attempting to stop infiltrators from the PAVN 27th Regiment and 33rd Sapper Battalion from coming through the DMZ. The operation continued until September, when the 3rd Marine Regiment was ordered to stop operations in preparation for its <a href="Operation%20Keystone%20Cardinal">redeployment back to the United States</a>. The battalion began to depart on 7 October and had fully arrived at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton by the end of 1969. Many 3rd Battalion Marines with time still left on their tours of duty were transferred to other units. 3rd Battalion spent over 1,600 days in Vietnam and conducted 48 combat operations, the most of any Marine battalion in the conflict. 653 Marines who served in 3rd Battalion 3rd Marines lost their lives during the Vietnam War or were killed while operating with other units. Nearly 2,800 others were wounded.

The battalion relocated during October and November 1969 to MCB Camp Pendleton and was reassigned to the 5th Marine Amphibious Brigade. They were again reassigned in April 1971 to the <a href="1st%20Marine%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">1st Marine Division</a>. The battalion was deactivated 1 June 1974.

3rd Battalion 3rd Marines was reactivated on 1 October 1975 at <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Base%20Hawaii">MCB Kaneohe Bay</a>, Hawaii, and assigned to the <a href="3rd%20Marine%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">3rd Marine Division</a>. Elements of the battalion deployed to the Western Pacific at various times during the 1970s and 1980s. In June 1979, Mike Company was deactivated and Weapons Company was stood up. In February 1980, following the <a href="Iran%20hostage%20crisis">Iran hostage crisis</a> and the <a href="Soviet%20invasion%20of%20Afghanistan">Soviet invasion of Afghanistan</a>, the battalion was deployed to the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a> on board the "<a href="USS%20Okinawa%20%28LPH-3%29">USS Okinawa</a>" and was also the back-up force during <a href="Operation%20Eagle%20Claw">Operation Eagle Claw</a>. This deployment made 3rd Battalion the first American ground unit to enter the region since World War II.

In the summer of 1983, the battalion was in <a href="Mombasa">Mombasa</a>, <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a> as part of the <a href="31st%20Marine%20Expeditionary%20Unit">31st Marine Amphibious Unit</a> (MAU) when the <a href="Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> ordered it to the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> to become part of the <a href="Multinational%20Force%20in%20Lebanon">Multinational Force in Lebanon</a> during the <a href="Lebanese%20Civil%20War">Lebanese Civil War</a>. It arrived on 12 September and spent three weeks off the coast as a reserve force for the <a href="24th%20Marine%20Expeditionary%20Unit">24th MAU</a> on the . It departed on 9 October for the Indian Ocean, two weeks before the <a href="1983%20Beirut%20barracks%20bombing">Beirut barracks bombing</a>.

On 2 August 1990, 3rd Battalion was completing a <a href="Unit%20Deployment%20Program">deployment</a> at <a href="Camp%20Hansen">Camp Hansen</a> on <a href="Okinawa">Okinawa</a> when they were notified to be prepared to immediately redeploy to Saudi Arabia as a response to the Iraqi <a href="invasion%20of%20Kuwait">invasion of Kuwait</a>. No sooner had the battalion returned to Hawaii then it was shipped out again to Saudi Arabia as part of the <a href="1st%20Marine%20Expeditionary%20Brigade">1st Marine Expeditionary Brigade</a>. India Company deployed first on 15 August to Singapore to provide onboard security for <a href="Maritime%20Prepositioning%20ship">Maritime Prepositioning ship</a>s bound for the port of <a href="Al%20Jubayl">Al Jubayl</a>. On 1 September, the rest of the battalion arrived in <a href="Dahran">Dahran</a>. As one of the first Marine units in country, 3rd Battalion found itself defending a key position at Cement Ridge, about 90 kilometers away from the Kuwaiti border. With orders to hold against any Iraqi attack, 3rd Battalion spent most of the months of August and September digging defensive positions. In October, 3rd Battalion and <a href="2nd%20Battalion%2C%203rd%20Marines">2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines</a> were designated "Task Force <a href="Taro%23Hawaii">Taro</a>" and moved to the extreme right flank of the Marine sector, bordering the King Abdul Aziz Brigade of the <a href="Saudi%20Arabian%20National%20Guard">Saudi Arabian National Guard</a>. Because of their close proximity, Taro was ordered to begin cross-training with the Saudi forces. This cross-training continued through January, when 3rd Battalion was moved forward to defend Al Mish'ab along the Saudi coast and became the northernmost Marine combat force in Saudi Arabia. Tragically during this time the battalion lost two Marines, James Cunningham and Anthony Stewart, who were accidentally killed by <a href="negligent%20discharge">negligent discharge</a>s.

<a href="Operation%20Desert%20Storm">Operation Desert Storm</a> began on 17 January 1991, but for the first two weeks 3rd Battalion only conducted sporadic engagements with its Iraqi counterparts across the border. That all changed on 29 January, when several Iraqi divisions unexpectedly crossed the border and <a href="Battle%20of%20Khafji">seized the Saudi town of Khafji</a>, less than 15 kilometers north of 3rd Battalion's position. During the attack the Executive Officer, Major Craig Huddleston, along with the Battalion <a href="Sergeant%20Major">Sergeant Major</a> and part of the battalion's Heavy Machine Gun Platoon, drove into the town on a rescue mission looking for two Army soldiers who had been captured. Although they were unable to find them, the Marines from 3rd Battalion did encounter an Iraqi patrol and exchanged rounds with them before escaping. While Saudi and <a href="Military%20of%20Qatar">Qatari</a> units ultimately retook the town, 3rd Battalion played a vital role in both coordinating air and artillery support for the attack and blocking further Iraqi advances southward. In addition, several heavy machine gun Humvees and <a href="forward%20air%20controller">forward air controller</a>s (FAC's) from the battalion were attached to the Saudi Brigade and took part in the assault. From 19–21 February, 3rd Battalion moved from Al Mish'ab to the forward assembly areas that it would be using to launch its attack into Kuwait. It was also during this period that 3rd Battalion was given its assignment for the ground offensive. Lacking heavy armor or motorized transport, the battalion (along with 2/3) would infiltrate Iraqi positions along the Saudi border on foot in darkness and provide right flank security for the rest of the 1st Marine Division to make its assault into Kuwait. On the night of 22 February, 3rd Battalion crossed the border into Kuwait, infiltrating past Iraqi <a href="Land%20mine">minefields</a>, tank traps, and other obstacles. Like many American units, 3rd Battalion encountered no Iraqi resistance and the biggest threat to the Marines came from <a href="friendly%20fire">friendly fire</a>. Throughout the ground war, the battalion advanced steadily northwards, spending an entire day traversing the burning oil fields, encountering no resistance but taking plenty of prisoners. 3rd Battalion arrived outside the <a href="Kuwait%20International%20Airport">Kuwait International Airport</a> around 27 February where a <a href="Scud">SCUD missile</a> landed near the battalion's command post. The battalion was on the grounds of Kuwait International Airport preparing to redeploy on order when the cease-fire was announced. After being trucked back south to Jubayl, on about March 7, 3rd Battalion returned to Hawaii, having suffered no combat casualties and being the first Marine unit to return home. 

Between its participation in Desert Storm and the <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29">Afghan War</a>, 3rd Battalion conducted multiple deployments around the Pacific Rim. In August 1991 the battalion participated in Operation Tafakula in Tonga, an international exercise involving elements of the <a href="French%20military">French military</a> and the Tongan defense services. In 1992 it conducted a <a href="Unit%20Deployment%20Program">Unit Deployment Program</a> (UDP) to Okinawa. In 1993 India Company participated in Operation Golden Eagle in Australia. In 1994 the battalion conducted another UDP to both <a href="Camp%20Hansen">Camp Hansen</a> on <a href="Okinawa">Okinawa</a> and to <a href="Camp%20Fuji">Camp Fuji</a> in Japan. On 8 June India Company participated in the 50th Anniversary of the <a href="Invasion%20of%20Saipan">Invasion of Saipan</a>. In October 1994 3rd Battalion was reassigned to the 3rd Marine Division. In 1995 the battalion went to <a href="Fort%20Wainwright">Fort Wainwright</a>, <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> for Operation Northern Edge, then spent the latter part of the year training at Camp Fuji and Okinawa. The battalion sent a composite company, made up of one platoon from each company, to Australia in March 1996 to cross train with the Australian 1st Royal Australian Regiment. In 1997 it conducted another UDP to Okinawa and <a href="Pohang">Pohang</a>, <a href="Korea">Korea</a>. During that time Weapons Company participated in Exercise Kennel Bear on Guam. Lima Company took part in Operation Valiant Mark with the <a href="Singapore%20Guards">1st Guards Battalion</a> of Singapore. In 1998 the battalion participated in Operation Southern Frontier in Australia, Kennel Bear in Okinawa, Forest Eagle/Freedom Banner in Korea, Forest Light on <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a>, Japan, and Fuji '99.
From 1999–2002, 3rd Battalion conducted operations Crocodile '99 and Tandem Thrust '01 in <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> and Townsend, Australia, Operation Tafakula in Tonga, and then conducted UDPs to Okinawa in 2000 and 2002. In 2002 the battalion participated in Operation Millenium Edge on <a href="Tinian">Tinian</a> and <a href="Guam">Guam</a>, then <a href="Balikatan">Balikatan</a> 02-2 in the Philippines, <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a>, Brunei, <a href="Korea">Korea</a>, Australia, and Japan. In 2003 3rd Battalion became BLT 3/3 on the <a href="31st%20MEU">31st MEU</a> for the second half of the year. Based on the "<a href="USS%20Essex%20%28LHD-2%29">USS Essex</a>", "<a href="USS%20Fort%20McHenry%20%28LSD-43%29">USS Fort McHenry</a>", and "<a href="USS%20Harpers%20Ferry%20%28LSD-49%29">USS Harpers Ferry</a>", BLT 3/3 participated in ARGEX-03 in the Philippines, provided security for President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> on <a href="Bali">Bali</a>, Indonesia, and also visited Japan, Australia, East Timor, and Hong Kong. In May and June 2004 Lima Company participated in Operation Cobra Gold II at <a href="Nakhon%20Ratchasima">Khorat</a>, Thailand and other parts of the battalion participated in Operation Northern Edge JTF-510 in Alaska. In July the battalion took part in the annual exercise of <a href="RIMPAC">RIMPAC</a> in Hawaii with Company C, 2nd Battalion Royal Australian Regiment on exchange. As part of the exchange, Kilo Company conducted Operation Gold Eagle in Lavarack Barracks, Townsville, Australia.

In late 2004, 3rd Battalion was notified it would be participating in Operation Enduring Freedom. On 31 October, the first Marines left <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Base%20Hawaii">Kaneohe Bay</a>, Hawaii for an eight-month deployment to eastern Afghanistan. While serving in Afghanistan, 3rd Battalion conducted Operation Spurs in February 2005, where they were inserted into the <a href="Korangal%20valley">Korangal valley</a> and conducted both <a href="counterinsurgency">counterinsurgency</a> and humanitarian operations. In March, 3rd Battalion launched a similar sweep called Operation Mavericks. During their time in Afghanistan, the Marines from 3rd Battalion engaged the Taliban in 22 firefights. In <a href="Operation%20Tar%20Heels">one of them</a> the battalion suffered its only fatalities for the deployment when LCPL Nicholas Kirven and <a href="Corporal">Corporal</a> Richard Schoener were killed during a three-hour firefight in <a href="Alishang">Alishang</a> which also resulted in twenty-three <a href="Taliban">Taliban</a> killed. During the fighting, Lieutenant <a href="Stephen%20Boada">Stephen Boada</a> was awarded the <a href="Silver%20Star">Silver Star</a> for calmly directing bombing runs on Taliban positions, despite having been wounded several times. In May the battalion launched one final operation, Operation Celtics, in the <a href="Tora%20Bora">Tora Bora</a> region. The operation was for the most part uneventful, although NBC news journalist <a href="Ron%20Allen%20%28journalist%29">Ron Allen</a> was almost killed while traveling with Kilo Company when his <a href="Humvee">Humvee</a> ran over an IED.

In mid-May 2010 3rd Battalion began deploying to the <a href="Nawa-I-Barakzayi%20District">Nawa-I-Barakzayi District</a> in <a href="Helmand%20Province">Helmand Province</a>, relieving the <a href="1st%20Battalion%2C%203rd%20Marines">1st Battalion, 3rd Marines</a>. Partnering with <a href="Afghan%20National%20Army">Afghan National Army</a> soldiers from the <a href="215th%20Corps%20%28Afghanistan%29">215th Corps</a>, the battalion found itself in an area awash with money as the <a href="U.S.%20Agency%20for%20International%20Development">U.S. Agency for International Development</a> was in the process of spending $30 million in an attempt to increase agricultural production (and create jobs for thousands of otherwise-potential <a href="Taliban">Taliban</a> recruits), but was also resulting in tensions between the local community council and tribal elders. In-mid June, Lima Company took part in <a href="Operation%20New%20Dawn%20%28Afghanistan%29">Operation New Dawn</a>, establishing observation posts in southern Shosharak, an area in between Nawa and <a href="Marjeh">Marjeh</a>. In late July, the battalion suffered the loss of Corporal Joe Wrighstman, who drowned in the <a href="Helmand%20River">Helmand River</a> while attempting to save the life of an <a href="Afghan%20National%20Police">Afghan National policeman</a>. India Company just days later had 3 squads from 3 different platoons ambushed by Taliban fighters in which they had to secure the crash site of Dealer 54, an <a href="HMLA-369">HMLA-369</a> helicopter which was shot down near <a href="Lashkar%20Gah">Lashkar Gah</a> while flying <a href="close%20air%20support">close air support</a> supporting a firefight at PB Meinert. India Company became involved in fierce firefights engaging the enemy at times just meters away. Throughout India Company's 7-month deployment they only called in 8 friendly evacuations after being engaged in over 92 Firefights and reported 174 enemy KIA. India Company operated out of | COP Spin Ghar | Patrol Base (PB) Jaker | PB Meinert | PB Poole | PB Skullet | PB Swenson | India Company's Marines were highly Awarded for their actions in Helmand during their operations including First Sgt. William Pinkerton awarded The Bronze Star Combat V. First Sgt. Pinkerton led the company's Marines from the front during 16 IED, 19 device, 14 cache finds and captured 6 insurgents. First Sgt. Pinkerton was first to push a squad to the Dealer 54s crash site through heavy Taliban Machine Gun fire and set up a safe perimeter to keep Taliban fighters from getting to downed pilots. Around this time, India Company conducted Operation Thresher and later Operation Mako in areas of Nawa District under heavy Taliban influence, finding several cache sites and taking some detainees. In September, while providing pre-election security for the <a href="Afghan%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202010">Afghan parliamentary elections</a> the battalion suffered another loss when 1st Lieutenant Scott Fleming was shot and killed. Nevertheless, on election day Nawa District was the one location in Helmand Province with no reported Taliban attacks. Residents claimed that the Marines from 3rd Battalion had implemented good security measures and encouraged the people to cooperate with the government, preventing the Taliban from firing a single shot. By the end of 3rd Battalion's deployment in the fall of 2010, Nawa was regarded by many as "a model of counterinsurgency operations and the most stable district" in southern Afghanistan.
In October 2011, 3rd Battalion deployed again to Helmand Province, this time to the <a href="Garmsir%20District">Garmsir District</a>. Located in southern Helmand, directly south of Nawa District, Garmsir was both a historically infiltration route for Taliban coming from <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, and is considered to have a culture very similar to Pakistan's. The deployment was marred by tragedy at the very beginning when the Chief of Police, LtCol Sayfullah Khan Rashidi, (who had previously served as Nawa District's Chief of Police during 3/3's deployment there) was killed along with two other Afghan National Police (ANP) by an IED on 6 November. Two days later, Hajji Abdullah Khan, an influential tribal elder with the <a href="Nurzai%20Tribe">Nurzai Tribe</a> in the <a href="Sar%20Banadar">Sar Banadar</a> area, was gunned down by a member of the <a href="Andar%20Tribe">Andar Tribe</a> following a shura with 3rd Battalion Marines. <a href="Afghan%20Border%20Police">Afghan Border Police</a> (ABP) were able to arrest the murderer, who was then successfully prosecuted under <a href="Law%20of%20Afghanistan">Afghan law</a>. A Taliban commander was also killed in <a href="Meyan%20Pashti">Meyan Pashti</a> around the same time. In mid-December, a squad from Lima Company was able to rescue an entire Afghan family when their car plunged into the Helmand River.
Starting in January 2012, 3rd Battalion and elements of the 215th Corps of the Afghan National Army began a series of airborne assaults at sparsely-populated and historically Taliban-controlled areas in Garmsir. On 4 January they launched Operation "Tageer Shamal" (Shifting Winds), aimed at clearing Taliban fighters from the western side of the <a href="Helmand%20River">Helmand River</a>. On 10 February they followed up with "Shahem Tofan" (Eagle Storm), a joint effort with the ABP aimed at interdicting smugglers moving through the desert in southeastern Garmsir. On 17 April, over 2,200 Afghans went to the polls to elect the Garmsir District Community Council, which – due to increases in security – now represented the entire district instead of just the northern part. Four days later, on 21 April, a <a href="suicide%20attack">suicide bomber</a> killed four Afghan Police in Garmsir; while medevacing the police, a <a href="Sikorsky%20UH-60%20Black%20Hawk">UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter</a> crashed, killing all four aboard.

In March 2006, 3rd Battalion 3rd Marines conducted its first OIF deployment to <a href="Al%20Anbar%20Governorate">Al Anbar province</a> in western Iraq. They relieved the <a href="3rd%20Battalion%201st%20Marines">3rd Battalion 1st Marines</a> in the <a href="Haditha">Haditha</a> area and were based out of the <a href="Haditha%20Dam">Haditha Dam</a>. This deployment was particularly sensitive, coming around the same time that news of the <a href="Haditha%20killings">Haditha killings</a> (where Marines had killed 24 civilians in the same area the previous November) broke in the United States. Once it arrived in Iraq, 3rd Battalion was given the mission of "fighting insurgents, working with locals to improve local economy and quality of life, and training Iraqi soldiers." The Battalion was also partnered up with the 2nd Battalion, 2nd Brigade of the <a href="Iraqi%20Army%23Deployment">7th Iraqi Army Division</a>. 3rd Battalion attempted to secure Haditha by using an approach of "constant presence". The battalion operated from a series of <a href="Forward%20Operating%20Base">forward operating bases</a> in the local cities of <a href="Haditha">Haditha</a>, <a href="Barwanah">Barwanah</a>, <a href="Haqlaniyah">Haqlaniyah</a>, and <a href="Baghdadi%2C%20Iraq">Baghdadi</a> from which the rifle and weapons companies sent out constant patrols to keep the insurgent groups off balance. However, the battalion was unable to create a working local police force, due to the overwhelming intimidation by insurgent groups. Battalion Commander LtCol <a href="Norman%20Cooling">Norman Cooling</a> observed, "We didn't have the manpower to control the [main roads] and hold Haditha. The Iraqi Army was as blind as we were. The insurgents killed anyone who spoke to us." One group of 15 police volunteers was murdered by insurgents in Baghdadi in May. Then in June a Marine mistook a local tribal leader driving near a convoy for a possible suicide bomber and killed him. Another groups of Marines in the same city had more success when they cornered a band of insurgents in the Haqlaniyah Hotel and blew it up. By June, attacks against Marines in Haqlaniyah had become common, with their base getting mortared about twice a week and some insurgents getting close enough to throw grenades over the wall into the base. On 3 June three insurgents opened fire on the Haqlaniyah base but were quickly killed after a group of Marines led by <a href="Gunnery%20Sergeant">Gunnery Sergeant</a> launched a hasty counterattack. In early September, 3rd Battalion launched a second effort to recruit police called <a href="Operation%20Guardian%20Tiger%20IV">Operation Guardian Tiger IV</a>. This recruitment drive was more successful than its predecessors and also detained 30 suspected insurgents. On 6 October, 3rd Battalion 3rd Marines returned to Kaneohe Bay. During their time in Haditha the Marines from 3rd Battalion 3rd Marines conducted more than 8,000 patrols, located 54 weapons caches and detained more than 800 suspected insurgents. The battalion had 11 Marines killed and 85 wounded.
The following year in August 2007, the battalion made its second Iraq deployment, this time to the <a href="Fallujah">Fallujah</a> area where they served under the <a href="6th%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">Regimental Combat Team 6</a> during the closing phases of <a href="Operation%20Alljah">Operation Alljah</a>. Their mission was to complete the <a href="Clear%20Hold%20Build">Clear Hold Build</a> operation in the areas of <a href="Karmah%2C%20Iraq">Karmah</a> and <a href="Zaidon">Zaidon</a> which the <a href="2nd%20Battalion%2C%205th%20Marines">2nd Battalion, 5th Marines</a> and <a href="2nd%20Battalion%2C%207th%20Marines">2nd Battalion, 7th Marines</a> had begun two months earlier. Karmah had become an important insurgent stronghold due its proximity both <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> and Fallujah. Unlike other cities, Karmah had no definable perimeter to hold, making it easy for outsiders to access. In addition, as insurgents were pushed out of Baghdad by other offensives they found it easy to flee to Karmah. In early September, Kilo Company moved into a cluster of villages northeast of Karmah that was the last major insurgent staging ground in Anbar. The insurgents fled without firing a shot. For the first few months the Marines took small-arms and mortar fire nightly. A 20-minute attack on 5 October against the Iraqi Police station in Karmah was repulsed by Jim Lanham, now a <a href="First%20Sergeant">First Sergeant</a>. By late 2007 the Marines frequently found themselves mediating between sheiks, assisting locals with reconstruction projects, and mentoring the <a href="Iraqi%20police">Iraqi police</a> units in the area. One company commander, Captain Quintin Jones, observed that, "On one end I'm fighting, and on the other end I'm disputing between tribal leaders. The other part (is) trying to stimulate the economy. So, it's a <a href="three-block%20war">three-block war</a> here and it's very, very dynamic." The battalion spent more than $1 million on Karmah, including a city council and a medical clinic. On 1 December, the battalion staged an elaborate reopening of "Victory Circle", or "The Lollipop", the marketplace in the center of Karmah which had earlier been the scene of fierce fighting between Marines and insurgents. In February 2008 the battalion rotated back to the United States without suffering a single casualty.

In April 2009 3/3 deployed for a third time to Iraq, this time to <a href="Al%20Asad%20Airbase">Al Asad Airbase</a> in Al Anbar Province. On that deployment they made up Task Force Military Police (TFMP). Task Force Military Police was a support unit fulfilling security responsibilities in Anbar Province, including conducting convoy security missions and detainee releases, running regional detention facilities, and also managing the <a href="wardogs">military working dogs</a> in Anbar Province. In addition, since November 2008 it had been tasked with securing Combat Outpost Heider in Rabiah, <a href="Nineveh%20Province">Nineveh Province</a>, as part of <a href="Operation%20Defeat%20Al%20Qaeda%20in%20the%20North">Operation Defeat Al Qaeda in the North</a> (OPDAN). In late July, Marines from the battalion operating as Task Force Personnel Recovery participated in and were responsible for the eventual recovery of the remains of a pilot, Navy Captain <a href="Scott%20Speicher">Scott Speicher</a>, who had been missing in action since the 1991 <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a>.
President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> later said he was "grateful to the Marines who pursued the information that led to Captain Speicher's recovery so that he can now come home." The deployment was mostly uneventful and 3/3 was ultimately relieved by <a href="3rd%20Battalion%2C%2024th%20Marines">3rd Battalion, 24th Marines</a>, which was the last Marine infantry battalion to deploy to Iraq. En route back to the United States one of the companies was detained in <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>, India for two days. The battalion lost one Marine, LCPL Ray Spencer, who died in a nonhostile incident.
With the exception of Weapons Co. who was deployed back to Fallujah under 1st Battalion 7th Marines. To assist in combat operations, and turn over to Iraq authority.

Since the beginning of World War II, the United States military has honored various units for extraordinary heroism or outstanding non-combat service. This information is compiled by the <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps%20History%20Division">United States Marine Corps History Division</a> and is certified by the Commandant of the Marine Corps.

According to research by the Marine Corps' History and Museum Division, the name "America's Battalion" originated in the mid-1980s when LtCol <a href="Charles%20Krulak">Charles Krulak</a> was the battalion's commanding officer. It comes from the nickname "America's Team", which was used by the <a href="Dallas%20Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a>. Krulak, who was a big Cowboys fan, modified the nickname to apply to 3rd Battalion. According to Krulak, at one point a friend of his sent him a letter addressed to the "Commanding Officer, America's Battalion". With nothing else on the envelope, the <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">United States Postal Service</a> still managed to deliver the letter properly. Krulak commented that "if the <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">U.S. Postal Service</a> recognized 3rd Battalion 3rd Marines as 'America's Battalion,' then they certainly must be." So from then on, he considered it 'official'. 3rd Battalion is one of two battalions to have the nickname "America's Battalion", the other being <a href="2nd%20Battalion%208th%20Marines">2nd Battalion 8th Marines</a> based out of <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Base%20Camp%20Lejeune">Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune</a>.

Among the many decorations for valor and bravery awarded to Marines from 3rd Battalion, five <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medals of Honor</a> and over twenty <a href="Navy%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Navy Cross</a>es have been awarded. <a href="South%20Bend%2C%20Indiana">South Bend</a> mayor <a href="John%20Alden%20Scott">John Alden Scott</a> served in the battalion during World War II and was awarded the Silver Star on Bougainville. In 1965, Corporal <a href="Robert%20Emmett%20O%27Malley">Robert Emmett O'Malley</a> from India Company became the first Marine in the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> to be awarded the Medal of Honor. Two other Marines from 3rd Battalion 3rd Marines, <a href="Robert%20J.%20Modrzejewski">Robert J. Modrzejewski</a> (1958–1959) and <a href="Howard%20V.%20Lee">Howard V. Lee</a> (1959–1960), would later be awarded the Medal of Honor in Vietnam while serving with other units. Colonel <a href="John%20Ripley%20%28USMC%29">John Ripley</a> (hero of <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Quang%20Tri%23Dong%20Ha">the bridge at Dong Ha</a>) was in command of Lima Company in 1967, and the company was frequently referred to as "Ripley's Raiders". One of his platoon commanders was former <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> player <a href="Chuck%20Goggin">Chuck Goggin</a>. <a href="Oliver%20North">Oliver North</a> served as a platoon commander in Kilo Company from 1968–1969 and <a href="Frank%20Tejeda">Frank Tejeda</a>, a Congressman from Texas, was a Kilo NCO for the same period. In 1979, <a href="James%20Mattis">James Mattis</a> served as commander of Kilo Company during the battalion's deployment aboard a MEU in the Indian Ocean. <a href="Charles%20Krulak">Charles Krulak</a>, the 31st <a href="Commandant%20of%20the%20Marine%20Corps">Commandant of the Marine Corps</a>, also commanded Lima Company during the Vietnam War and later served as Battalion Commander from 1983–1985. Krulak is also credited with giving 3rd Battalion 3rd Marines the nickname "America's Battalion". In more recent years, War on Terror alumni include Medal of Honor recipient <a href="Dakota%20Meyer">Dakota Meyer</a>, Navy Cross recipient <a href="Luis%20Fonseca">Luis Fonseca</a>, "<a href="Terminal%20Lance">Terminal Lance</a>" creator Maximilian Uriarte, "<a href="The%20Duffel%20Blog">The Duffel Blog</a>" creator Paul Szoldra, and "<a href="Castra%20Praetoria%23References%20in%20literature%20and%20popular%20culture">Castra Praetoria</a>" <a href="Warblog">milblogger</a> Michael Burke.
