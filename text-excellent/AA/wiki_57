Blackrock (film)

Blackrock is a 1997 Australian <a href="Drama%20film">drama</a> <a href="Thriller%20%28genre%29">thriller</a> film produced by <a href="David%20Elfick">David Elfick</a> and Catherine Knapman, directed by <a href="Steven%20Vidler%20%28actor%29">Steven Vidler</a> with the screenplay by <a href="Nick%20Enright">Nick Enright</a>. Marking Vidler's directorial debut, the film was adapted from the <a href="Blackrock%20%28play%29">play of the same name</a>, also written by Enright, which was inspired by the <a href="murder%20of%20Leigh%20Leigh">murder of Leigh Leigh</a>. The film stars <a href="Laurence%20Breuls">Laurence Breuls</a>, <a href="Simon%20Lyndon">Simon Lyndon</a> and <a href="Linda%20Cropper">Linda Cropper</a>, and also features the first credited film performance of <a href="Heath%20Ledger">Heath Ledger</a>. The film follows Jared (Breuls), a young surfer who witnesses his friends raping a girl. When she is found murdered the next day, Jared is torn between revealing what he saw and protecting his friends.

Leigh's family opposed the fictionalisation of her murder, though protests against the film were abandoned after it received financial backing from the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Film%20and%20Television%20Office">New South Wales Film and Television Office</a>. "Blackrock" was filmed over a period of two weeks at locations including <a href="Stockton%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Stockton</a>, where Leigh was murdered, a decision that was opposed by local residents who said that memories of the murder were still fresh. While the film was never marketed as being based on a true story, numerous comparisons between the murder and the film were made, and many viewers believed it to be a factual account of the murder.

The film premiered at the <a href="Sundance%20Film%20Festival">Sundance Film Festival</a>, and was also shown at the <a href="Boston%20Film%20Festival">Boston Film Festival</a>, though it failed to find an American theatrical distributor. It was nominated for five <a href="AACTA%20Awards">AACTA Awards</a>, including Best Film, and won the Feature Film – Adaptation award as well as the <a href="Major%20AWGIE%20Award">Major Award</a> at the 1997 <a href="AWGIE%20Awards">AWGIE Awards</a>. It received generally positive reviews in Australia, where it grossed $1.1 million at the box office. Outside Australia, where audiences were less familiar with Leigh's murder, critical reception of the film was mixed.

Blackrock is an Australian beachside working-class suburb where <a href="surfing">surfing</a> is popular among youths like Jared (<a href="Laurence%20Breuls">Laurence Breuls</a>). His first serious girlfriend is Rachel (<a href="Jessica%20Napier">Jessica Napier</a>), who comes from a much wealthier part of the city. One day, Ricko (<a href="Simon%20Lyndon">Simon Lyndon</a>), a surfer popular among the local youths, returns from an eleven-month trip. Jared's mother Diane (<a href="Linda%20Cropper">Linda Cropper</a>) attempts to tell Jared that she has been diagnosed with breast cancer, though Jared insists on talking to her later as he is busy arranging a "welcome home" party for Ricko at the local surf club. Rachel's father, a photographer who takes provocative images of women, forbids her from attending the party, though he allows her older brother Toby (<a href="Heath%20Ledger">Heath Ledger</a>) to attend.

While driving to the party, Toby sees Tracy (<a href="Bojana%20Novakovic">Bojana Novakovic</a>), Cherie (<a href="Rebecca%20Smart">Rebecca Smart</a>) and two other girls, and gives them a ride. Jared flirts with Tracy at the party and subsequently gets into a fight with Toby. Ricko comes to Jared's defence, though Jared breaks up the fight after Ricko has hit Toby several times. Tracy comes to comfort Toby and Jared leaves the party to head to the beach alone. Jared sees Toby having consensual sex with Tracy on the beach. He then witnesses three of his male friends interrupting the couple and raping Tracy. Tracy calls out for help, though Jared, who is visibly disturbed by what he is witnessing, does not intervene. Toby and the other three boys, who never noticed Jared was watching, flee the area. Jared also runs away, leaving Tracy alone and distressed. Later that night Rachel, who has snuck out of home to attend the party, finds Tracy's beaten corpse on the beach.

Jared initially tells the police nothing of what he saw. He is torn between the need to tell the truth and the desire to protect his friends; his anger leads to the breakdown of his relationships with both Rachel and Diane. Despite Jared's silence, police arrest Toby and the three other boys within a few days. Jared decides to tell the police what he saw, as he believes Toby and the other boys will be charged with Tracy's murder; however, on his way into the police station he is confronted by Ricko. Ricko confesses to Jared that he killed Tracy, but claims it was an accident – that she hit her head on a rock when he attempted to have sex with her. He has already told police that he was with Jared all night and asks Jared to confirm his alibi in the name of <a href="mateship">mateship</a>. Diane, who still has not been able to tell Jared that she has cancer due to his behaviour, goes in to have surgery.

Jared tells the police that he was with Ricko; when he tries to suggest Tracy's death may have been an accident, the police show him the photos of Tracy's battered body. Jared aggressively confronts Ricko at the beach and Ricko confesses that Tracy's death was not an accident. He had found her walking on the beach after the rape and she asked him to take her home. He agreed, but wanted to have sex with her first. She tried to fight him off and bit him in the process, which enraged him enough to beat her to death.

As Ricko finishes his confession, the police arrive and he realises that Jared has turned him in. He attempts to escape but the police give chase and corner him on a cliff. Rather than go to jail, and ignoring Jared's screams of protest, he jumps to his death. In the weeks that follow, Jared's life collapses. Despite learning of Diane's illness, he moves out of her house, choosing instead to be homeless. Jared returns home one day to collect his belongings; after arguing with Diane, he confesses that he witnessed Tracy's rape and could have saved her life if he had intervened or helped her afterwards. Later that day, Jared joins Diane and Cherie in cleaning graffiti from Tracy's grave.

Writing in the journal "<a href="American%20Association%20for%20Australian%20Literary%20Studies">Antipodes</a>", academics Felicity Holland and Jane O'Sullivan credit the film with exploring the themes of Australian masculinity, mateship, violence and sexuality. The film's portrayal of a rape and murder at a teenage party suggests that serious crime can arise from drinking and fun simply getting out of hand. The violence, they say, erupts from extreme <a href="larrikin">larikkinism</a> rather than the archetypal psychopathy seen in other films featuring violence towards women. The film's critique of criminal masculinity undermines the status of previously celebrated masculine lawbreakers in Australian history and cinema, such as <a href="Ned%20Kelly">Ned Kelly</a> and <a href="Michael%20%26quot%3BCrocodile%26quot%3B%20Dundee">Mick Dundee</a>. The authors believe that the focus on masculinity leaves the female victim largely out of the film; they consider the "near erasure" of Tracy to be a troubling aspect; the film instead focuses on portraying the males as victims of their class, masculinity and mateship.

Director Steven Vidler said the film was not about a rape, rather it was "about the culture that allowed it to happen." Vidler defended the choice to give the rape victim a minor role, stating, "It was important to show that this could have happened to anyone. We didn't want to give away too much about the victim so we could maintain that suspense." Producer <a href="David%20Elfick">David Elfick</a> said that the film was about contemporary Australia; about "kids who have all their life to enjoy, then a deadly mixture of drugs, alcohol, sexual tension, and desire add up to a tragedy."

Brian Joyce, the director of <a href="Newcastle%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Newcastle</a>'s Freewheels Theatre in Education, approached playwright <a href="Nick%20Enright">Nick Enright</a>, encouraging him to create a play that explored themes around the 1989 rape and <a href="murder%20of%20Leigh%20Leigh">murder of Leigh Leigh</a> in <a href="Stockton%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Stockton</a>, a beach area of Newcastle. Leigh's family objected to the fictionalisation of her murder. Titled "A Property of the Clan", the 45-minute play premiered at the Freewheels Theatre in 1992 and was performed at the <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Dramatic%20Art">National Institute of Dramatic Art</a> in 1993. The play was shown at various high-schools in the Newcastle area and, following its positive reception, was shown nationally at high schools across the country over a period of eighteen months.

In 1994, the <a href="Sydney%20Theatre%20Company">Sydney Theatre Company</a> commissioned Enright to develop the play into a feature-length production. The resulting play was titled "<a href="Blackrock%20%28play%29">Blackrock</a>". "Blackrock" retained the original four characters from "A Property of the Clan", and added nine others; it was considered a more fictionalised version of Leigh's murder. The narrative and emphasis were reshaped for an adult audience rather than for a specifically educational environment.

While the revisions to the play "Blackrock" were still being finalised, Enright started working with first-time director Steven Vidler to direct a film version, which would also be titled "Blackrock". By December 1995, Vidler was working with Enright as an unofficial script editor, although they were having trouble finding financing for the film. Vidler said he considered directing the film "Blackrock" after having watched and been moved by the theatrical version, saying the play was "absolutely what it was like [for him] growing up in the <a href="Greater%20Western%20Sydney">Western Suburbs</a>... It's about keeping bonded with your mates. Nothing else matters... It's about the unbelievable lengths boys will go to keep those bonds solid." Leigh's mother Robyn campaigned to have production of the film halted, but her attempts failed after the film received government financial backing from the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Film%20and%20Television%20Office">New South Wales Film and Television Office</a>.

"Blackrock" was filmed over a period of two weeks with a cast and crew of about 70. A call for extras received an enthusiastic response by many teenagers in the Newcastle area. Filming locations included Stockton, <a href="Maroubra%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Maroubra Beach</a>, <a href="Caves%20Beach%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Caves Beach</a>, and <a href="University%20House%20%28Newcastle%29">NESCA House</a>. Notable Stockton landmarks seen in the film include the Stockton Ferry and Stockton Bridge. 

The community of Stockton opposed filming in the area, as memories of Leigh's murder were still fresh and the details of the script were "too close for comfort". When filmmakers arrived in Stockton in late August 1996, locations that had previously been reserved were suddenly no longer available. The local media treated them with hostility. Former Newcastle deputy mayor and Stockton resident Frank Rigby criticised the film during production, saying "I would just love it to go away and so would everybody else." Brian Joyce was also critical of the decision to film in the area, saying the filmmakers had to acknowledge the choice they had made in doing so. The situation was exacerbated by the filmmakers' denial that the film was specifically about Leigh, despite their choice of Stockton for filming. During production in September 1996, Elfick told "<a href="The%20Newcastle%20Herald">The Newcastle Herald</a>" that he was "getting a bit bored" of people mentioning Leigh's murder. While acknowledging that the comments were understandable, Elfick concluded, "Unfortunately, that event happens all over Australia. We wanted to take the events of that murder and many other murders". He was also quoted in "<a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a>" as saying, "The movie is bigger than the Leigh Leigh thing". Elfick hoped that people viewing the film would see it as a positive way of looking at the circumstances that led to Leigh's death, and that it would make people think and maybe stop something like that happening to someone in the future. Leigh's family were vehemently opposed to the film, saying that the filmmakers were "feasting on an unfortunate situation", insensitively trivialising and exploiting her death, and portraying her negatively while doing so. One of Leigh's aunts wrote to "The Newcastle Herald" later that month, saying "David Elfick doesn't seem to mind free publicity even if it comes from the tragic and brutal assault, rape, and murder of a fourteen-year-old virgin, not as he called it: 'the Leigh Leigh thing which happens all over Australia.'" Enright said that while Leigh's murder served as the inspiration, the completed film is about the way a small town reacts when one of its own members murders another.

Sandy George from <a href="Australian%20Screen%20Online">Australian Screen Online</a> said that Vidler's long career as an actor helped him "draw the terrific performances" from the film's young actors. 17-year-old <a href="Laurence%20Breuls">Laurence Breuls</a> was literally the first person to audition for the role of Jared. Hundred of others auditioned though Breuls remained the favourite choice. Vidler chose <a href="Simon%20Lyndon">Simon Lyndon</a>, who played the role of Jared in the original stage production of "Blackrock", for the role of Ricko, stating that Lyndon had the looks, charisma, and complexity to play the role. <a href="Rebecca%20Smart">Rebecca Smart</a>, who also portrayed Cherie in the original stage production, was the only person to reprise their role from the play. "Blackrock" is often considered to be <a href="Heath%20Ledger">Heath Ledger</a>'s debut film, but he had an uncredited minor role in the 1991 film "<a href="Clowning%20Around">Clowning Around</a>". While Ledger's role in "Blackrock" is small, it is credited with garnering him attention in Australia, leading to more prominent acting roles. 15-year-old <a href="Bojana%20Novakovic">Bojana Novakovic</a> was given the role of Tracy partly because she was a competitive gymnast and was considered mentally and physically strong enough to film the rape scene. Vidler discussed the role with her parents before filming commenced, who despite initial reservations, eventually gave permission for her to film the scene. Novakovic said the experience was traumatic and she began to tremble uncontrollably once the shoot ended, though recovered shortly afterwards, concluding, "In a way, I feel lucky to have had such a role at the beginning of my career. I don't think I'll ever be scared by an emotional scene again." The boys involved in the scene showed up at her door the following day and gave her a bunch of flowers and a T-shirt that said "<a href="shit%20happens">shit happens</a>". Vidler said he found the performance so powerful that when he first watched the <a href="Dailies">rushes</a> of the scene alone, he burst into tears.

The soundtrack to the film was released on 28 April 1997 on <a href="Mercury%20Records">Mercury Records</a> Australia. Vidler said a lot of time was spend sifting through hundred of CDs "trying to find stuff that was not only appropriate for the film but would also be appealing to the audiences and hopefully, you know, would be released around the same time as the film, which isn't as easy as it sounds!" Jonathan Lewis from "<a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>" gave the album four and a half out of five stars, concluding that it was "A fine collection of songs that, given the diversity of artists featured, is surprisingly cohesive as an album."


The film debuted at the <a href="Sundance%20Film%20Festival">Sundance Film Festival</a> on 24 January 1997. It was also shown at the <a href="Boston%20Film%20Festival">Boston Film Festival</a> in September 1997. The version of the film shown outside Australia was around 100 minutes long; upon reviewing this version the <a href="Australian%20Classification%20Board">Australian Classification Board</a> gave it an 'R' rating, stating the rape scene was "too harrowing and confronting" for an MA15+ rating. Vidler subsequently cut about 10 minutes of footage out of the film so it could receive an MA15+ rating and reach its target audience of 15- to 18-year-olds. "Blackrock" opened in cinemas in Australia on 1 May 1997. It grossed $1,136,983 at the Australian box office.

In anticipation of the film's debut at Sundance, John Brodie from "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" said the film could be the "thunder from Down Under the way "<a href="Shine%20%28film%29">Shine</a>" was last year." Having watched the film at Sundance, David Rooney from "Variety" praised several of the actors' performances and said the film "should score with kids the protagonists' age, but its soap-opera-style plotting and overwritten dialogue will limit wider acceptance". "<a href="Premiere%20%28magazine%29">Premiere</a>" also gave a negative review of the film's debut, commenting that audiences had been expecting to see another "Shine", though left the screening disappointed. Elfick acknowledged that the initial screening of "Blackrock" at Sundance was less well received, which he blamed on sound problems. He stated that the issue was rectified for the second and third screenings, which were much more successful. Diane Carmen of "<a href="The%20Denver%20Post">The Denver Post</a>" gave the film a positive review of the film, which she said left audiences at Sundance "reeling with its intensity", concluding it was "almost guaranteed to find a distributor in the U.S", though in the event the film never received American distribution. Having viewed the film at the Boston Film Festival, Chris Wright from "<a href="The%20Phoenix%20%28newspaper%29">The Phoenix</a>" concluded, "Even with its slightly over-the-top dénouement, "Blackrock" is a believable, touching teen drama. It's also a gripping thriller".

R.S. Murthi from the Malaysian newspaper "<a href="New%20Straits%20Times">New Straits Times</a>" gave the film two out of five stars, concluding it is "an unflattering but somewhat forced look at the wild side of teen life that at times seems dangerously tolerant of unrestrained teen behaviour." Associate professor Donna Lee Brien of <a href="Central%20Queensland%20University">Central Queensland University</a> said that when shown outside Australia, the film lacks the "poignant and powerful narrative support of Leigh's tragedy" and was deemed by critics to be "shallow and clichéd".

Australian novelist and critic <a href="Robert%20Drewe">Robert Drewe</a> gave a positive review, praising the performance of Breuls, the cinematography by Martin McGrath, and director Steven Vidler's choice of such a controversial subject for a first film. Upon noting that the filmmakers deliberately insisted that their characters be portrayed as different from the actual people involved in the Leigh Leigh murder as possible, Drewe said the film is "asking a lot of Australian audiences to expunge reality from their memories", though he concluded that the film should be "compulsory viewing for all Australian teenagers." Rob Lowing from "<a href="The%20Sun-Herald">The Sun-Herald</a>" noted that the film belonged to a slew of <a href="Australasia">Australasia</a>n films that focused on <a href="middle%20class">middle class life</a> and ultimately gave the film 3½ stars out of 4, stating, "if you went to see "<a href="Romper%20Stomper">Romper Stomper</a>", "<a href="Metal%20Skin">Metal Skin</a>", "<a href="Idiot%20Box%20%28film%29">Idiot Box</a>" or "<a href="Once%20Were%20Warriors%20%28film%29">Once Were Warriors</a>", this gritty, punchy social drama ably fits into that class."

In her book "Who Killed Leigh Leigh?", Kerry Carrington, a <a href="criminologist">criminologist</a> and prominent researcher of Leigh's murder, had both criticism and praise for the film. She praised it for dispelling "the myth" that sexual violence is confined to one <a href="social%20class">social class</a>, for illustrating how boys model their sexual conduct on their fathers' treatment of women, and how the culture of <a href="sex%20segregation">sex segregation</a> in workplaces can carry over into the public life of a town, exacerbating sexist beliefs and behaviours. She criticised the film, however, for the "strong impression" it makes that ineffectual mothers are part of the underlying problem and for several differences between Leigh's murder and the film that she considered to be disrespectful to Leigh's memory, in particular the film's "Hollywood ending".

Donna Lee Brien stated that just as the filmmakers attempted to distance themselves from Leigh's murder, the city of Newcastle attempted to distance itself from "Blackrock". A 1999 feature in "The Sydney Morning Herald" discussing cinematic production in Newcastle mentioned everything from <a href="Mel%20Gibson">Mel Gibson</a>'s 1977 debut film "<a href="Summer%20City">Summer City</a>" to a <a href="short%20film">short film</a> festival that year, but made no mention of "Blackrock". Brien theorised that some of the condemnation the film received may have been due to public frustration with the legal system, as the film achieves justice for the victim, whereas no one was ever convicted of raping Leigh. Brien cited the film as an example of why sensitivity and care must be taken when fictionalising an actual crime.

A <a href="DVD%20region%20code">region 1</a> DVD was released on 29 October 2002 containing the original version of the film. A region 4 DVD was released on 19 November 2003 containing the edited version. Special features included a four-minute featurette, cast and crew interviews, a 'goof reel' which included footage of a bonding trip made by Simon Lyndon, Laurence Bruels and Cameron Nugent to <a href="Lennox%20Head%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Lennox Head</a>, and the film's original trailer and television advertisement. According to Andrew L. Urban from Urban Cinefile the featurette was "overburdened" with clips from the film, but was otherwise of interest. Urban also praised the seven-minute interview with Nick Enright.

None of the promotional material for the film mentioned Leigh and the film was not marketed as being "based on a true story". The film's credits state that it is a work of fiction and that resemblance to "actual events or persons living or dead is entirely coincidental". Nevertheless, numerous comparisons between the film and Leigh's murder were made. Just like the play it was based on, "Blackrock" was often incorrectly considered by viewers to be a factual account of Leigh's murder. <a href="Conflation">Conflation</a> between the two subjects was high; the film was described by Miriam Davis on radio station "FM 91.5" as being the true story of "the murder of Leigh Warner at Blackrock Beach near Newcastle." Donna Lee Brien stated that every review of both the film and the play it was based on at least mentioned Leigh, with some going into great detail on the subject. Kerry Carrington stated that the film was very accurate in some aspects of the murder, yet very distant in others, as if the film was "having a bet <a href="Each-way%20%28bet%29">each way</a>".

Jared is an entirely fictional character, though he has been interpreted as a metaphor for everyone who witnessed Leigh being publicly assaulted yet did nothing. In the film, Tracy does not ask her parents for permission to attend the party as she knows this would be denied, whereas Leigh obtained permission from her parents, who were told the party would be supervised. Tracy wears a short skirt, tight-fitting top, and <a href="Wedge%20%28footwear%29">wedged-heels</a> to the party, while Leigh wore ordinary shorts, a <a href="Sweater">jumper</a>, and sand-shoes. Tracy's body is found that night by a girl; Leigh's body was found the next day by a boy. Tracy's mother packs up her daughter's bedroom the following day, whereas Leigh's mother left her room untouched for months. In the film, police labour until every boy involved in the rape and murder is punished, whereas no one was convicted for raping Leigh and <a href="Murder%20of%20Leigh%20Leigh%23Criticism%20of%20police">police received criticism for alleged incompetence</a>. Tracy's murderer was 22 years old, well-toned, and committed suicide, while Leigh's was 18 years old, , and was jailed.

Both murderers, however, were high-school dropouts who were interested in mechanics, were considered to have no emotional depth, and were prone to violence. The party in the film was considered to be "an almost perfect re-creation" of the party in Stockton; a surf club is hired for the night with teenage attendees being entertained by a high-school band. The party spills out into the surrounding area where there are fights, and teenagers are seen stumbling, vomiting and unconscious. Tracy's funeral was also considered to be "a direct re-staging" of Leigh's service; both Leigh and Tracy's friends placed red roses on her coffin and then plant a tree in her memory. Both Leigh and Tracy's mothers worked at a nursing home and both their fathers called for the <a href="Capital%20punishment">death penalty</a> for her murderer. Parents are blamed for neglecting their children in both cases.

Details that were considered to be undoubtedly taken from Leigh's murder included the filming location of Stockton, the presence of the song "<a href="If%20I%20Could%20Turn%20Back%20Time">If I Could Turn Back Time</a>" featured at Leigh's funeral appearing in the original script (though it did not appear in the finished film), and posters reading "Shame Blackrock Shame" seen on telegraph poles following Tracy's murder; posters appeared around Stockton following Leigh's murder stating "Shame Stockton Shame: <a href="Informant">Dob</a> the gutless bastards in".

"Blackrock" received five nominations at the 1997 <a href="AACTA%20Awards">AACTA Awards</a>, though did not win any awards. It won both the 'Feature Film – Adaptation' award and the <a href="Major%20AWGIE%20Award">Major Award</a> at the 1997 <a href="AWGIE%20Awards">AWGIE Awards</a>.

Chicago Pile-1

Chicago Pile-1 (CP-1) was the world's first <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>. On 2 December 1942, the first human-made self-sustaining <a href="nuclear%20chain%20reaction">nuclear chain reaction</a> was initiated in CP-1, during an experiment led by <a href="Enrico%20Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a>. The secret development of the reactor was the first major technical achievement of the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>, the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> effort to create <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a>s during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Although the project's civilian and military leaders had misgivings about the possibility of a disastrous runaway reaction, they nevertheless decided due to time pressure to carry out the experiment in a densely populated area. It was built by the <a href="Metallurgical%20Laboratory">Metallurgical Laboratory</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a>, under the west viewing stands of the original <a href="Stagg%20Field">Stagg Field</a>. Fermi described the apparatus as "a crude pile of black bricks and wooden timbers". 

The reactor was assembled in November 1942, by a team that included Fermi, <a href="Leo%20Szilard">Leo Szilard</a> (who had previously <a href="Leo%20Szilard%23Developing%20the%20idea%20of%20the%20nuclear%20chain%20reaction">formulated an idea</a> for <a href="Nuclear%20chain%20reaction%23History">non-fission chain reaction</a>), <a href="Leona%20Woods">Leona Woods</a>, <a href="Herbert%20L.%20Anderson">Herbert L. Anderson</a>, <a href="Walter%20Zinn">Walter Zinn</a>, <a href="Martin%20D.%20Whitaker">Martin D. Whitaker</a>, and <a href="George%20Weil">George Weil</a>. Because the <a href="uranium%20enrichment">enrichment of uranium</a> had not yet begun at the Oak Ridge site, the reactor used natural uranium rather than uranium enriched in isotope 235. This required a very large amount of material in order to reach criticality, along with graphite used as a <a href="neutron%20moderator">neutron moderator</a>. The reactor contained 45,000 ultra-pure <a href="graphite">graphite</a> blocks weighing 360 tons, and was fueled by 5.4 tons of <a href="uranium">uranium</a> metal and 45 tons of <a href="uranium%20oxide">uranium oxide</a>. Unlike most subsequent nuclear reactors, it had no radiation shielding or cooling system as it operated at very low power – about one-half watt. 

The success of the reactor provided the first vivid demonstration of the feasibility of the military use of nuclear energy by the Allies, and the reality of the danger that Nazi Germany would succeed in producing nuclear weapons and win the war with them. Previously, estimates of critical masses had been crude calculations, leading to order-of-magnitude uncertainties about the size of a hypothetical bomb. The successful use of graphite as a moderator paved the way for progress in the Allied effort, whereas the German program languished partly because of the belief that scarce and expensive heavy water would have to be used for that purpose.

In 1943, CP-1 was moved to <a href="Red%20Gate%20Woods">Red Gate Woods</a>, and reconfigured to become Chicago Pile-2 (CP-2). There, it was operated until 1954, when it was dismantled and buried. The stands at Stagg Field were demolished in August 1957; the site is now a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a> and a <a href="Chicago%20Landmark">Chicago Landmark</a>.

The idea of <a href="chemical">chemical</a> <a href="chain%20reaction">chain reaction</a>s was first suggested in 1913 by the German chemist <a href="Max%20Bodenstein">Max Bodenstein</a> for a situation in which two molecules react to form not just the final reaction products, but also some unstable molecules which can further react with the original substances to cause more to react. The concept of a <a href="nuclear%20chain%20reaction">nuclear chain reaction</a> was first hypothesized by the Hungarian scientist <a href="Leo%20Szilard">Leo Szilard</a> on 12 September 1933. Szilard realized that if a nuclear reaction produced <a href="neutron">neutron</a>s or <a href="dineutron">dineutron</a>s, which then caused further nuclear reactions, the process might be self-perpetuating. Szilard proposed using mixtures of lighter known isotopes which produced neutrons in copious amounts, and also entertained the possibility of using <a href="uranium">uranium</a> as a fuel. He filed a patent for his idea of a simple nuclear reactor the following year. The discovery of <a href="nuclear%20fission">nuclear fission</a> by German chemists <a href="Otto%20Hahn">Otto Hahn</a> and <a href="Fritz%20Strassmann">Fritz Strassmann</a> in 1938, and its theoretical explanation (and naming) by their collaborators <a href="Lise%20Meitner">Lise Meitner</a> and <a href="Otto%20Frisch">Otto Frisch</a>, opened up the possibility of creating a nuclear chain reaction with uranium or <a href="indium">indium</a>, but initial experiments were unsuccessful.

In order for a chain reaction to occur, fissioning uranium atoms had to emit additional neutrons to keep the reaction going. At <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a> in New York, Italian physicist, <a href="Enrico%20Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a>, with Americans <a href="John%20R.%20Dunning">John Dunning</a>, <a href="Herbert%20L.%20Anderson">Herbert L. Anderson</a>, <a href="Eugene%20T.%20Booth">Eugene T. Booth</a>, <a href="G.%20N.%20Glasoe">G. Norris Glasoe</a>, and <a href="Francis%20G.%20Slack">Francis G. Slack</a> conducted the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States on 25 January 1939. Subsequent work confirmed that fast neutrons were indeed produced by fission. Szilard obtained permission from the head of the Physics Department at Columbia, <a href="George%20B.%20Pegram">George B. Pegram</a>, to use a laboratory for three months, and persuaded <a href="Walter%20Zinn">Walter Zinn</a> to become his collaborator. They conducted a simple experiment on the seventh floor of <a href="Pupin%20Hall">Pupin Hall</a> at Columbia, using a radium-beryllium source to bombard uranium with neutrons. They discovered significant neutron multiplication in natural uranium, proving that a chain reaction might be possible.

Fermi and Szilard still believed that enormous quantities of uranium would be required for an <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a>, and therefore concentrated on producing a controlled chain reaction. Fermi urged <a href="Alfred%20O.%20C.%20Nier">Alfred O. C. Nier</a> to separate uranium isotopes for determination of the fissile component, and, on 29 February 1940, Nier separated the first <a href="uranium-235">uranium-235</a> sample, which, after being mailed to Dunning at Columbia, was confirmed to be the isolated fissile material. When he was working in Rome, Fermi had discovered that collisions between neutrons and <a href="neutron%20moderator">neutron moderator</a>s can slow the neutrons down, and thereby make them more likely to be captured by uranium nuclei, causing the uranium to fission. Szilard suggested to Fermi that they use <a href="carbon">carbon</a> in the form of <a href="graphite">graphite</a> as a moderator. As a back-up plan, he considered <a href="heavy%20water">heavy water</a>. This contained <a href="deuterium">deuterium</a>, which would not absorb neutrons like ordinary hydrogen, and was a better neutron moderator than carbon; but heavy water was expensive and difficult to produce, and several tons of it might be needed. Fermi estimated that a fissioning uranium nucleus produced 1.73 neutrons on average. It was enough, but a careful design was called for to minimize losses. (Today the average number of neutrons emitted per fissioning uranium-235 nucleus is known to be about 2.4).

Szilard estimated he would need about of graphite and of uranium. In December 1940, Fermi and Szilard met with <a href="Herbert%20G.%20MacPherson">Herbert G. MacPherson</a> and Victor C. Hamister at <a href="National%20Carbon%20Company">National Carbon</a> to discuss the possible existence of impurities in graphite, and the procurement of graphite of a purity that had never been produced commercially. National Carbon, a chemical company, had taken the then unusual step of hiring MacPherson, a physicist, to research carbon arc lamps, a major commercial use for graphite at that time. Because of his work studying the spectroscopy of the carbon arc, MacPherson knew that the major relevant contaminant was boron, both because of its concentration and its affinity for absorbing neutrons, confirming a suspicion of Szilard's. More importantly, MacPherson and Hamister believed that techniques for producing graphite of a sufficient purity could be developed. Had Fermi and Szilard not consulted MacPherson and Hamister, they might have concluded, incorrectly, as the Germans did, that graphite was unsuitable for use as a neutron moderator.

Over the next two years, MacPherson, Hamister and Lauchlin M. Currie developed thermal purification techniques for the large scale production of low boron content graphite. The resulting product was designated AGOT graphite ("<a href="Acheson%20process">Acheson Graphite</a> Ordinary Temperature") by National Carbon. With a <a href="Neutron%20cross%20section">neutron absorption cross section</a> of 4.97 <a href="Barn%20%28unit%29">mbarns</a>, the AGOT graphite is considered as the first true <a href="Nuclear%20graphite">nuclear-grade graphite</a>. By November 1942 National Carbon had shipped 255 tons of AGOT graphite to the University of Chicago, where it became the primary source of graphite to be used in the construction of Chicago Pile-1.

Szilard drafted a confidential letter to the President, <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, warning of a <a href="German%20nuclear%20weapon%20project">German nuclear weapon project</a>, explaining the possibility of nuclear weapons, and encouraging the development of a program that could result in their creation. With the help of <a href="Eugene%20Wigner">Eugene Wigner</a> and <a href="Edward%20Teller">Edward Teller</a>, he approached his old friend and collaborator <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> in August 1939, and convinced him to sign the letter, lending his prestige to the proposal. The <a href="Einstein%E2%80%93Szilard%20letter">Einstein–Szilard letter</a> resulted in the establishment of research into nuclear fission by the U.S. government. An <a href="Advisory%20Committee%20on%20Uranium">Advisory Committee on Uranium</a> was formed under <a href="Lyman%20J.%20Briggs">Lyman J. Briggs</a>, a scientist and the director of the <a href="National%20Bureau%20of%20Standards">National Bureau of Standards</a>. Its first meeting on 21 October 1939 was attended by Szilard, Teller and Wigner. The scientists persuaded the Army and Navy to provide $6,000 for Szilard to purchase supplies for experiments—in particular, more graphite.
In April 1941, the <a href="National%20Defense%20Research%20Committee">National Defense Research Committee</a> (NDRC) created a special project headed by <a href="Arthur%20Compton">Arthur Compton</a>, a Nobel-Prize-winning physics professor at the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a>, to report on the uranium program. Compton's report, submitted in May 1941, foresaw the prospects of developing <a href="radiological%20weapon">radiological weapon</a>s, <a href="nuclear%20propulsion">nuclear propulsion</a> for ships, and <a href="nuclear%20weapons">nuclear weapons</a> using uranium-235 or the recently discovered <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a>. In October he wrote another report on the practicality of an atomic bomb. For this report, he worked with Fermi on calculations of the <a href="critical%20mass">critical mass</a> of uranium-235. He also discussed the prospects for <a href="uranium%20enrichment">uranium enrichment</a> with <a href="Harold%20Urey">Harold Urey</a>.

<a href="Niels%20Bohr">Niels Bohr</a> and <a href="John%20Archibald%20Wheeler">John Wheeler</a> had theorized that heavy isotopes with odd atomic <a href="mass%20number">mass number</a>s were <a href="fissile">fissile</a>. If so, then <a href="plutonium-239">plutonium-239</a> was likely to be. In May 1941, <a href="Emilio%20Segr%C3%A8">Emilio Segrè</a> and <a href="Glenn%20Seaborg">Glenn Seaborg</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California</a> produced 28 μg of plutonium in the 60-inch <a href="cyclotron">cyclotron</a> there, and found that it had 1.7 times the <a href="thermal%20neutron">thermal neutron</a> capture cross section of uranium-235. At the time only such minute quantities of plutonium-239 had been produced, in cyclotrons, and it was not possible to produce a sufficiently large quantity that way. Compton discussed with Wigner how plutonium might be produced in a <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>, and with <a href="Robert%20Serber">Robert Serber</a> about how that plutonium might be separated from uranium. His report, submitted in November, stated that a bomb was feasible.

The final draft of Compton's November 1941 report made no mention of plutonium, but after discussing the latest research with <a href="Ernest%20Lawrence">Ernest Lawrence</a>, Compton became convinced that a plutonium bomb was also feasible. In December, Compton was placed in charge of the plutonium project. Its objectives were to produce reactors to convert uranium to plutonium, to find ways to chemically separate the plutonium from the uranium, and to design and build an atomic bomb. It fell to Compton to decide which of the different types of reactor designs the scientists should pursue, even though a successful reactor had not yet been built. He proposed a schedule to achieve a controlled nuclear chain reaction by January 1943, and to have an atomic bomb by January 1945.

In a nuclear reactor, <a href="Criticality%20%28status%29">criticality</a> is achieved when the rate of neutron production is equal to the rate of neutron losses, including both neutron absorption and neutron leakage. When a uranium-235 atom undergoes fission, it releases an average of 2.4 neutrons. In the simplest case of an <a href="neutron%20reflector">unreflected</a>, homogeneous, spherical reactor, the critical radius was calculated to be approximately:
where "M" is the average distance that a neutron travels before it is absorbed, and "k" is the average <a href="four%20factor%20formula">neutron multiplication factor</a>. The neutrons in succeeding reactions will be amplified by a factor "k", the second generation of fission events will produce "k", the third "k" and so on. In order for a <a href="self-sustaining%20nuclear%20chain%20reaction">self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction</a> to occur, "k" must be at least 3 or 4 percent greater than 1. In other words, "k" must be greater than 1 without crossing the <a href="Prompt%20criticality">prompt critical</a> threshold that would result in a rapid, <a href="Exponential%20growth">exponential increase</a> in the number of fission events.

Fermi christened his apparatus a "pile". Emilio Segrè later recalled that:

Another grant, this time of $40,000, was obtained from the S-1 Uranium Committee to purchase more materials, and in August 1941 Fermi began to plan the building of a sub-critical assembly to test with a smaller structure whether a larger one would work. The so-called exponential pile he proposed to build was long, wide and high. This was too large to fit in the Pupin Physics Laboratories. Fermi recalled that: 
The pile was built in September 1941 from graphite blocks and <a href="tinplate">tinplate</a> iron cans of uranium oxide. The cans were cubes. When filled with uranium oxide, each weighed about . There were 288 cans in all, and each was surrounded by graphite blocks so the whole would form a cubic lattice structure. A <a href="Neutron%20source%23Radioisotopes%20which%20decay%20with%20alpha%20particles%20packed%20in%20a%20low-Z%20elemental%20matrix">radium-beryllium neutron source</a> was positioned near the bottom. The uranium oxide was heated to remove moisture, and packed into the cans while still hot on a shaking table. The cans were then soldered shut. For a workforce, Pegram secured the services of Columbia's <a href="American%20football">football</a> team. It was the custom at the time for football players to perform odd jobs around the university. They were able to manipulate the heavy cans with ease. The final result was a disappointing "k" of 0.87.

Compton felt that having teams at Columbia University, <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a>, the University of Chicago and the University of California was creating too much duplication and not enough collaboration, and he resolved to concentrate the work in one location. Nobody wanted to move, and everybody argued in favor of their own location. In January 1942, soon after the United States entered World War II, Compton decided on his own location, the University of Chicago, where he knew he had the unstinting support of university administration. Chicago also had a central location, and scientists, technicians and facilities were more readily available in the <a href="Midwest">Midwest</a>, where war work had not yet taken them away. In contrast, Columbia University was engaged in uranium enrichment efforts under Harold Urey and John Dunning, and was hesitant to add a third secret project.

Before leaving for Chicago, Fermi's team made one last attempt to build a working pile at Columbia. Since the cans had absorbed neutrons, they were dispensed with. Instead, the uranium oxide, heated to to dry it out, was pressed into cylindrical holes long and in diameter drilled into the graphite. The entire pile was then canned by soldering sheet metal around it, and the contents heated above the boiling point of water to remove moisture. The result was a "k" of 0.918.

In Chicago, <a href="Samuel%20K.%20Allison">Samuel K. Allison</a> had found a suitable location long, wide and high, sunk slightly below ground level, in a space under the stands at <a href="Stagg%20Field">Stagg Field</a> originally built as a <a href="rackets%20%28sport%29">rackets</a> court. Stagg Field had been largely unused since the University of Chicago had given up playing American football in 1939, but the rackets courts under West Stands were still used for playing <a href="Squash%20%28sport%29">squash</a> and <a href="handball">handball</a>. <a href="Leona%20Woods">Leona Woods</a> and <a href="Anthony%20L.%20Turkevich">Anthony L. Turkevich</a> played squash there in 1940. Since it was intended for strenuous exercise, the area was unheated, and very cold in the winter. The nearby North Stands had a pair of ice skating rinks on the ground floor, which although they were unrefrigerated, seldom melted in winter. Allison used the rackets court area to construct a experimental pile before Fermi's group arrived in 1942.

The <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">United States Army Corps of Engineers</a> assumed control of the nuclear weapons program in June 1942, and Compton's <a href="Metallurgical%20Laboratory">Metallurgical Laboratory</a> became part of what came to be called the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>. <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Brigadier General</a> <a href="Leslie%20R.%20Groves%2C%20Jr.">Leslie R. Groves, Jr.</a> became director of the Manhattan Project on 23 September 1942. He visited the Metallurgical Laboratory for the first time on 5 October. Between 15 September and 15 November 1942, groups under Herbert Anderson and Walter Zinn constructed 16 experimental piles under the Stagg Field stands.

Fermi designed a new pile, which would be spherical to maximize "k", which was predicted to be around 1.04, thereby achieving criticality. Leona Woods was detailed to build <a href="boron%20trifluoride">boron trifluoride</a> <a href="neutron%20detector">neutron detector</a>s as soon as she completed her doctoral thesis. She also helped Anderson locate the large number of timbers required at lumber yards in <a href="Chicago%27s%20south%20side">Chicago's south side</a>. Shipments of high-purity <a href="graphite">graphite</a> arrived, mainly from National Carbon, and high-purity <a href="uranium%20dioxide">uranium dioxide</a> from <a href="Mallinckrodt">Mallinckrodt</a> in St Louis, which was now producing a month. Metallic uranium also began arriving in larger quantities, the product of newly developed techniques.

On 25 June, the Army and the <a href="Office%20of%20Scientific%20Research%20and%20Development">Office of Scientific Research and Development</a> (OSRD) had selected a site in the <a href="Red%20Gate%20Woods">Argonne Forest</a> near Chicago for a plutonium pilot plant. This became known as Site A. were leased from <a href="Cook%20County">Cook County</a> in August, but by September it was apparent that the proposed facilities would be too extensive for the site, and it was decided to build the pilot plant elsewhere. The subcritical piles posed little danger, but Groves felt that it would be prudent to locate a critical pile—a fully functional nuclear reactor—at a more remote site. A building at Argonne to house Fermi's experimental pile was commenced, with its completion scheduled for 20 October. Due to industrial disputes, construction fell behind schedule, and it became clear the materials for Fermi's new pile would be on hand before the new structure was completed. In early November, Fermi came to Compton with a proposal to build the experimental pile under the stands at Stagg Field.
The risk of building an operational reactor running at criticality in a populated area was a significant issue, as there was a danger of a catastrophic <a href="nuclear%20meltdown">nuclear meltdown</a> blanketing one of the United States' major urban areas in radioactive fission products. But the physics of the system suggested that the pile could be safely shut down even in the event of a <a href="Criticality%20accident">runaway reaction</a>. When a fuel atom undergoes fission, it releases neutrons that strike other fuel atoms in a chain reaction. The time between absorbing the neutron and undergoing fission is measured in nanoseconds. Szilard had noted that this reaction leaves behind <a href="fission%20product">fission product</a>s that may also release neutrons, but do so over much longer periods, from microseconds to as long as minutes. In a slow reaction like the one in a pile where the fission products build up, these neutrons account for about three percent of the total <a href="neutron%20flux">neutron flux</a>.

Fermi argued that by using the <a href="delayed%20neutron">delayed neutron</a>s, and by carefully controlling the reaction rates as the power is ramped up, a pile can reach criticality at fission rates slightly below that of a chain reaction relying solely on the <a href="prompt%20neutron">prompt neutron</a>s from the fission reactions. Since the rate of release of these neutrons depends on fission events taking place some time earlier, there is a delay between any power spikes and the later criticality event. This time gives the operators leeway; if a spike in the prompt neutron flux is seen, they have several minutes before this causes a runaway reaction. If a neutron absorber, or <a href="neutron%20poison">neutron poison</a>, is injected at any time during this period, the reactor will shut down. Consequently, the reaction can be controlled with <a href="electromechanical">electromechanical</a> <a href="control%20system">control system</a>s such as <a href="control%20rod">control rod</a>s. Compton felt this delay was enough to provide a critical margin of safety, and allowed Fermi to build Chicago Pile-1 at Stagg Field.

Compton later explained that:
Compton informed Groves of his decision at the 14 November meeting of the S-1 Executive Committee. Although Groves "had serious misgivings about the wisdom of Compton's suggestion", he did not interfere. <a href="James%20B.%20Conant">James B. Conant</a>, the chairman of the NDRC, was reported to have turned white. But because of the urgency and their confidence in Fermi's calculations, no one objected.

Chicago Pile 1 was encased within a balloon so that the air inside could be replaced by <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>. Anderson had a dark gray balloon manufactured by <a href="Goodyear%20Tire%20and%20Rubber%20Company">Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company</a>. A cube-shaped balloon was somewhat unusual, but the Manhattan Project's AAA priority rating ensured prompt delivery with no questions asked. A <a href="block%20and%20tackle">block and tackle</a> was used to haul it into place, with the top secured to the ceiling and three sides to the walls. The remaining side, the one facing the balcony from which Fermi directed the operation, was furled like an awning. A circle was drawn on the floor, and the stacking of graphite blocks began on the morning of 16 November 1942. The first layer placed was made up entirely of graphite blocks, with no uranium. Layers without uranium were alternated with two layers containing uranium, so the uranium was enclosed in graphite. Unlike later reactors, it had no radiation shielding or cooling system, as it was only intended to be operated at very low power.

The work was carried out in twelve-hour shifts, with a day shift under Zinn and a night shift under Anderson. For a work force they hired thirty high school dropouts that were eager to earn a bit of money before being drafted into the Army. They machined 45,000 graphite blocks enclosing 19,000 pieces of uranium metal and uranium oxide. The graphite arrived from the manufacturers in bars of various lengths. They were cut into standard lengths of , each weighing . A lathe was used to drill holes in the blocks for the control rods and the uranium. A hydraulic press was used to shape the uranium oxide into "pseudospheres", cylinders with rounded ends. Drill bits had to be sharpened after each 60 holes, which worked out to be about once an hour. Graphite dust soon filled the air and made the floor slippery.

Another group, under Volney C. Wilson, was responsible for instrumentation. They also fabricated the <a href="control%20rods">control rods</a>, which were <a href="cadmium">cadmium</a> sheets nailed to flat wooden strips, cadmium being a potent neutron absorber, and the <a href="scram">scram</a> line, a <a href="manila%20rope">manila rope</a> that when cut would drop a control rod into the pile and stop the reaction. Richard Fox, who made the control-rod mechanism for the pile, remarked that the manual speed control that the operator had over the rods was simply a <a href="variable%20resistor">variable resistor</a>, controlling an <a href="electric%20motor">electric motor</a> that would <a href="wikt%3Aspool">spool</a> the <a href="clothesline">clothesline</a> wire over a pulley that also had two lead weights attached to ensure it would <a href="fail-safe">fail-safe</a> and return to its zero position when released.
About two layers were laid per shift. Woods' boron trifluoride neutron counter was inserted at the 15th layer. Thereafter, readings were taken at the end of each shift. Fermi divided the square of the radius of the pile by the intensity of the radioactivity to obtain a metric that counted down to one as the pile approached criticality. At the 15th layer, it was 390; at the 19th it was 320; at the 25th it was 270 and by the 36th it was only 149. The original design was for a spherical pile, but as work proceeded, it became clear that this would not be necessary. The new graphite was purer, and of very pure metallic uranium began to arrive from the <a href="Ames%20Project">Ames Project</a> at <a href="Iowa%20State%20University">Iowa State University</a>, where a team under <a href="Frank%20Spedding">Frank Spedding</a> had developed <a href="Ames%20process">a new process</a> to produce uranium metal. <a href="Westinghouse%20Lamp%20Plant">Westinghouse Lamp Plant</a> supplied , which it produced in a rush with a makeshift process.

The metallic uranium cylinders, known as "Spedding's eggs", were dropped in the holes in the graphite in lieu of the uranium oxide pseudospheres. The process of filling the balloon with carbon dioxide would not be necessary, and twenty layers could be dispensed with. According to Fermi's new calculations, the countdown would reach 1 between the 56th and 57th layers. The resulting pile was therefore flatter on the top than on the bottom. Anderson called a halt after the 57th layer was placed. When completed, the wooden frame supported an elliptical-shaped structure, high, wide at the ends and across the middle. It contained of uranium metal, of uranium oxide and of graphite, at an estimated cost of $2.7 million.

The next day, 2 December 1942, everybody assembled for the experiment. There were 49 scientists present. Although most of the S-1 Executive Committee was in Chicago, only <a href="Crawford%20Greenewalt">Crawford Greenewalt</a> was present, at Compton's invitation. Other dignitaries present included Szilard, Wigner and Spedding. Fermi, Compton, Anderson and Zinn gathered around the controls on the balcony, which was originally intended as a viewing platform. Samuel Allison stood ready with a bucket of concentrated cadmium nitride, which he was to throw over the pile in the event of an emergency. The startup began at 09:54. Walter Zinn removed the zip, the emergency control rod, and secured it. Norman Hilberry stood ready with an axe to cut the scram line, which would allow the zip to fall under the influence of gravity. While Leona Woods called out the count from the boron trifluoride detector in a loud voice, <a href="George%20Weil">George Weil</a>, the only one on the floor, withdrew all but one of the control rods. At 10:37 Fermi ordered Weil to remove all but of the last control rod. Weil withdrew it at a time, with measurements being taken at each step.

The process was abruptly halted by the automatic control rod reinserting itself, due to its trip level being set too low. At 11:25, Fermi ordered the control rods reinserted. He then announced that it was lunch time.

The experiment resumed at 14:00. Weil worked the final control rod while Fermi carefully monitored the neutron activity. Fermi announced that the pile had gone critical (reached a self-sustaining reaction) at 15:25. Fermi switched the scale on the recorder to accommodate the rapidly increasing electrical current from the boron trifluoride detector. He wanted to test the control circuits, but after 28 minutes, the alarm bells went off to notify everyone that the neutron flux had passed the preset safety level, and he ordered Zinn to release the zip. The reaction rapidly halted. The pile had run for about 4.5 minutes at about 0.5 watts. Wigner opened a bottle of <a href="Chianti">Chianti</a>, which they drank from paper cups.

Compton notified Conant by telephone. The conversation was in an impromptu code:
On 12 December 1942 CP-1's power output was increased to 200 W, enough to power a light bulb. Lacking shielding of any kind, it was a radiation hazard for everyone in the vicinity, and further testing was continued at 0.5 W. Operation was terminated on 28 February 1943, and the pile was dismantled and moved to <a href="Site%20A/Plot%20M%20Disposal%20Site">Site A</a> in the Argonne Forest, now known as Red Gate Woods. There the original materials were used to build Chicago Pile-2 (CP-2). Instead of being spherical, the new reactor was built in a cube-like shape, about tall with a base approximately square. It was surrounded by concrete walls thick that acted as a <a href="radiation%20shield">radiation shield</a>ing, with overhead protection from of lead and of wood. More uranium was used, so it contained of uranium and of graphite. No cooling system was provided as it only ran at a few kilowatts. CP-2 became operational in March 1943, with a "k" of 1.055. During the war Zinn allowed CP-2 to be run around the clock, and its design was suitable for conducting experiments.
CP-2 was joined by <a href="Chicago%20Pile-3">Chicago Pile-3</a>, the first heavy water reactor, which went critical on 15 May 1944.
The reactors were used to undertake research related to weapons, such as investigations of the properties of <a href="tritium">tritium</a>. Wartime experiments included measuring the neutron absorption cross-section of elements and compounds. Albert Wattenberg recalled that about 10 elements were studied each month, and 75 over the course of a year. An accident involving radium and beryllium powder caused a dangerous drop in his <a href="white%20blood%20cell">white blood cell</a> count that lasted for three years. As the dangers of things such as inhaling uranium oxide became more apparent, experiments were conducted on the effects of radioactive substances on laboratory test animals.

Though held secret for a decade, Fermi patented the design, with a initial filing date of Dec. 19, 1944 as the "neutronic reactor" no. 2,708,656.

The Red Gate Woods later became the original site of <a href="Argonne%20National%20Laboratory">Argonne National Laboratory</a>, which replaced the Metallurgical Laboratory on 1 July 1946, with Zinn as its first director. CP-2 and CP-3 operated for ten years before they outlived their usefulness, and Zinn ordered them shut down on 15 May 1954. Their remaining usable fuel was transferred to <a href="Chicago%20Pile-5">Chicago Pile-5</a> at the Argonne National Laboratory's new site in <a href="DuPage%20County">DuPage County</a>, and the CP-2 and CP-3 reactors were dismantled in 1955 and 1956. Some of the graphite blocks from CP-1/CP-2 were reused in the reflector of the <a href="Transient%20Reactor%20Test%20Facility%20%28TREAT%29">TREAT</a> reactor. High-level nuclear waste such as fuel and heavy water were shipped to <a href="Oak%20Ridge%2C%20Tennessee">Oak Ridge, Tennessee</a>, for disposal. The rest was encased in concrete and buried in a trench in what is now known as the <a href="Site%20A/Plot%20M%20Disposal%20Site">Site A/Plot M Disposal Site</a>. It is marked by a commemorative boulder.
By the 1970s there was increased public concern about the levels of radioactivity at the site, which was used by the local residents for recreational purposes. Surveys conducted in the 1980s found <a href="strontium-90">strontium-90</a> in the soil at Plot M, trace amounts of tritium in nearby wells, and plutonium, technetium, caesium, and uranium in the area. In 1994, the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Energy">United States Department of Energy</a> and the Argonne National Laboratory yielded to public pressure and earmarked $24.7 million and $3.4 million respectively to rehabilitate the site. As part of the clean up, of radioactive waste was removed and sent to the <a href="Hanford%20Site">Hanford Site</a> for disposal. By 2002, the <a href="Illinois%20Department%20of%20Public%20Health">Illinois Department of Public Health</a> had determined that the remaining materials posed no danger to public health.

The successful test of CP-1 not only proved that a nuclear reactor was feasible, it demonstrated that the "k" factor was larger than originally thought. This removed the objections to the use of air or water as a coolant rather than expensive helium. It also meant that there was greater latitude in the choice of materials for coolant pipes and control mechanisms. Wigner now pressed ahead with his design for a water-cooled production reactor. There remained concerns about the ability of a graphite-moderated reactor being able to produce plutonium on industrial scale, and for this reason the Manhattan Project continued the <a href="P-9%20Project">development of heavy water production facilities</a>. An air-cooled reactor, the <a href="X-10%20Graphite%20Reactor">X-10 Graphite Reactor</a>, was built at the <a href="Clinton%20Engineer%20Works">Clinton Engineer Works</a> in Oak Ridge as part of a plutonium semiworks, followed by larger water-cooled production reactors at the Hanford Site in <a href="Washington%20state">Washington state</a>. Enough plutonium was produced for an atomic bomb by July 1945, and for two more in August.

A commemorative plaque was unveiled at Stagg Field on 2 December 1952, the occasion of the tenth anniversary of CP-1 going critical. It read: The plaque was saved when the West Stands were demolished in August 1957. The site of CP-1 was designated as a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a> on 18 February 1965. When the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> was created in 1966, it was immediately added to that as well. The site was also named a <a href="Chicago%20Landmark">Chicago Landmark</a> on 27 October 1971.
Today the site of the old Stagg Field is occupied by the University's <a href="Regenstein%20Library">Regenstein Library</a>, which was opened in 1970, and the <a href="Joe%20and%20Rika%20Mansueto%20Library">Joe and Rika Mansueto Library</a>, which was opened in 2011. A <a href="Henry%20Moore">Henry Moore</a> sculpture, "<a href="Nuclear%20Energy%20%28sculpture%29">Nuclear Energy</a>", stands in a small quadrangle just outside the Regenstein Library. It was dedicated on 2 December 1967, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of CP-1 going critical. The commemorative plaques from 1952, 1965 and 1967 are nearby. A graphite block from CP-1 can be seen at the <a href="Bradbury%20Science%20Museum">Bradbury Science Museum</a> in <a href="Los%20Alamos%2C%20New%20Mexico">Los Alamos, New Mexico</a>; another is on display at the <a href="Museum%20of%20Science%20and%20Industry%20%28Chicago%29">Museum of Science and Industry</a> in Chicago.

Samuel J. Randall

Samuel Jackson Randall (October 10, 1828 – April 13, 1890) was an American politician from <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> who served as a <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> member of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a> for <a href="Pennsylvania%27s%201st%20congressional%20district">Pennsylvania's 1st congressional district</a> from 1863 to 1875 and from <a href="Pennsylvania%27s%203rd%20congressional%20district">Pennsylvania's 3rd congressional district</a> from 1875 to 1890. He served as the 29th <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the House</a> from 1876 to 1881 and was twice a contender for his party's nomination for <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a>.

Born in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> to a family active in <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig</a> politics, Randall shifted to the Democratic Party after the Whigs' demise. His rise in politics began in the 1850s with election to the Philadelphia Common Council and then to the <a href="Pennsylvania%20State%20Senate">Pennsylvania State Senate</a> for the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Senate%2C%20District%201">1st district</a>. Randall served in a Union cavalry unit in the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> before winning a seat in the federal House of Representatives in 1862. He was reelected every two years thereafter until his death. The representative of an industrial region, Randall became known as a staunch defender of <a href="protectionism">protective tariffs</a> designed to assist domestic producers of manufactured goods. While often siding with <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republicans</a> on tariff issues, he differed with them in his resistance to <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction</a> and the growth of federal power.

Randall's defense of smaller, less centralized government raised his profile among House Democrats, and they elevated him to Speaker in 1876. He held that post until the Democrats lost control of the House in 1881, and was considered a possible nominee for President in 1880 and 1884. Randall's support for high tariffs began to alienate him from most Democrats, and when that party regained control of the House in 1883, he was denied another term as Speaker. Randall continued to serve in Congress as head of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Appropriations">Appropriations Committee</a>. He remained a respected party leader, but gradually lost influence as the Democrats became more firmly wedded to <a href="free%20trade">free trade</a>. Worsening health also curtailed his power until his death in 1890.

Randall was born on October 10, 1828 in <a href="Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</a>, the eldest son of Josiah and Ann Worrell Randall. Three younger brothers soon followed: William, Robert, and Henry. Josiah Randall was a leading Philadelphia lawyer who had served in the <a href="Pennsylvania%20General%20Assembly">state legislature</a> in the 1820s. Randall's paternal grandfather, Matthew Randall, was a judge on the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Courts%20of%20Common%20Pleas">Pennsylvania Courts of Common Pleas</a> and county <a href="prothonotary">prothonotary</a> in that city in the early 19th century. His maternal grandfather, Joseph Worrell, was also a prominent citizen, active in politics for the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> during <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>'s presidency. Josiah Randall was a <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig</a> in politics, but drifted into the Democratic fold after the Whig Party dissolved in the 1850s.

When Randall was born, the family lived at Seventh and Walnut Streets in what is now <a href="Center%20City%20Philadelphia">Center City Philadelphia</a>. Randall was educated at the University Academy, a school affiliated with the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>. On completing school at age 17, he did not follow his father into the law, but instead took a job as a <a href="Bookkeeping">bookkeeper</a> with a local silk merchant. Shortly thereafter, he started a coal delivery business and, at age 21, became a partner in a scrap iron business named Earp and Randall.

Two years later, in 1851, Randall married Fannie Agnes Ward, the daughter of <a href="Aaron%20Ward%20%28representative%29">Aaron</a> and Mary Watson Ward of <a href="Ossining%20%28village%29%2C%20New%20York">Sing Sing</a>, New York. Randall's new father-in-law was a major general in the New York militia and had served in Congress as a <a href="Jacksonian%20democracy">Jacksonian Democrat</a> for several terms between 1825 and 1843. Randall and Fannie went on to have three children: Ann, Susan, and Samuel Josiah.

In 1851, Randall assisted his father in the election campaign for a local judge. The judge, a Whig, was elected despite considerable opposition from a candidate of the nativist <a href="Know%20Nothing">American Party</a> (commonly called the "Know-Nothing Party"). The strength of this group, combined with the Whigs' declining fortunes, led Samuel Randall to call himself an "American Whig" when he ran for <a href="Philadelphia%20City%20Council">Philadelphia Common Council</a> the following year. He was elected, holding office for four one-year terms from 1852 to 1856. The period was one of significant change in Philadelphia's governance, as all of <a href="Philadelphia%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Philadelphia County</a>'s townships and boroughs <a href="Act%20of%20Consolidation%2C%201854">were consolidated</a> into one city in 1854.
As the Whig Party fell apart, Randall and his family became Democrats. Josiah Randall was friendly with <a href="James%20Buchanan">James Buchanan</a>, a Pennsylvania Democrat then serving as the United States' <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20the%20United%20Kingdom">envoy in Great Britain</a>. Both Randall and his father attended the <a href="1856%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">Democratic National Convention</a> in 1856 to work for Buchanan's nomination for president, which was successful. When, in 1858, a vacancy occurred in Randall's <a href="Pennsylvania%20State%20Senate">state Senate</a> district, he ran for election (as a Democrat) for the remainder of the term, and was elected. Still only 30 years old, Randall had risen rapidly in politics. Much of his term in the state Senate was spent dealing with the incorporation of <a href="Horsecar">street railway</a> companies, which he believed would benefit his district. Randall also supported legislation to reduce the power of banks, a policy that he would continue to advocate for his entire political career. In 1860, he ran for election to a full term in the state Senate while his brother Robert ran for a seat in the <a href="Pennsylvania%20House%20of%20Representatives">state House of Representatives</a>. Ignoring their father's advice that it meant "too much Randall on the ticket," both brothers were unsuccessful.

In 1861, the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> began as eleven Southern states seceded from the Union to form the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a>. Randall joined the <a href="First%20Troop%20Philadelphia%20City%20Cavalry">First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry</a> in May of that year as a <a href="Private%20%28rank%29">private</a>. The unit was stationed in central Pennsylvania and eastern Virginia during Randall's 90-day enlistment, but saw no action during that time. In 1863, he re-joined the unit, this time being elected <a href="captain%20%28United%20States%29">captain</a>. The First Troop was sent back to central Pennsylvania during the <a href="Gettysburg%20campaign">Gettysburg campaign</a> that summer, when Confederate forces under <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a> invaded Pennsylvania. He served as <a href="provost%20marshal">provost marshal</a> at <a href="Gettysburg%2C%20Pennsylvania">Gettysburg, Pennsylvania</a> in the days before <a href="battle%20of%20Gettysburg">the battle there</a>, and had the same role at <a href="Columbia%2C%20Pennsylvania">Columbia, Pennsylvania</a> during the battle, but did not see combat. As historian Albert V. House explained, "[h]is military career was respectable, but far from arduous, most of his duties being routine reconnoitering which seldom led him under fire."

In 1862, before rejoining his cavalry unit, Randall was elected to the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a> from <a href="Pennsylvania%27s%201st%20congressional%20district">Pennsylvania's 1st congressional district</a>.
The city had been <a href="gerrymandering">gerrymandered</a> by a <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> legislature to create four solidly Republican districts, with the result that as many Democrats as possible were lumped into the 1st district. Gaining the Democratic nomination was, thus, tantamount to election; Randall defeated former mayor <a href="Richard%20Vaux">Richard Vaux</a> for their party's endorsement and won easily over his Republican opponent, Edward G. Webb. He won with the help of William "Squire" McMullen, the Democratic <a href="Political%20boss">boss</a> of the fourth ward, who would remain a lifelong Randall ally.

Under the congressional calendar of the 1860s, members of the <a href="38th%20United%20States%20Congress">38th United States Congress</a>, elected in November 1862, did not begin their work until December 1863. Randall arrived that month, after being discharged from his cavalry unit, to join a Congress dominated by Republicans. As a member of the minority, Randall had little opportunity to author legislation, but quickly became known as a hard-working and conscientious member. <a href="James%20G.%20Blaine">James G. Blaine</a>, a Republican also first elected in 1862, later characterized Randall as "a strong partisan, with many elements of leadership. He ... never neglects his public duties, and never forgets the interests of the Democratic Party."

Randall was known as a friend to the manufacturers in his district, especially as it concerned <a href="Protectionism">protective tariffs</a>. Despite being in the minority, Randall spoke often in defense of his constituents' interests. As House described him, With his party continually in the minority, Randall gained experience in the functioning of the House, but his tenure left little evidence in the statute book. He attracted little attention, but kept his constituents happy and was repeatedly reelected.

When the 38th Congress convened in December 1863, the Civil War was approaching its end. Randall was a <a href="War%20Democrats">War Democrat</a>, sometimes siding with his Republican colleagues to support measures in pursuit of victory over the Confederates. When a bill was proposed to allow President <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> to promote <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> to <a href="Lieutenant%20general%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant general</a>, Randall voted in favor, unlike most in his party. He voted with the majority of Democrats, however, to oppose allowing <a href="United%20States%20Colored%20Troops">black men to serve</a> in the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a>.

When it came to political plans for the post-war nation, he was strictly opposed to most Republican-proposed measures. Republicans proposed the <a href="Thirteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Thirteenth Amendment</a> to the Constitution in 1865, which would abolish <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slavery</a>, and Randall spoke against it. Claiming opposition to slavery, Randall said his objections stemmed instead from a belief that the amendment was "a beginning of changes in the Constitution and the forerunner of usurpation." After <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a> became president following <a href="Assassination%20of%20Abraham%20Lincoln">Lincoln's assassination</a>, Randall came to support Johnson's policies for <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction</a> of the defeated South, which were more lenient than those of the Republican majority in Congress. In 1867, the Republicans proposed requiring an <a href="ironclad%20oath">ironclad oath</a> from all Southerners wishing to vote, hold office, or practice law in federal courts, making them swear they had never borne arms against the United States. Randall led a 16-hour <a href="filibuster">filibuster</a> against the measure; in spite of his efforts, it passed.

Randall began to gain prominence in the small Democratic caucus by opposing Reconstruction measures. His delaying tactics against fellow Pennsylvanian <a href="Thaddeus%20Stevens">Thaddeus Stevens</a>'s military Reconstruction bill in February 1867 kept the bill from being considered for two weeks—long enough to prevent it from being voted on until the next session. He likewise spoke against what would become the <a href="Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment</a> to the Constitution. Although he opposed the amendment, Randall did favor the idea behind part of it: <a href="Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution%23Validity%20of%20public%20debt">section 4</a>, which guarantees that Congress may not repudiate the federal debt, nor may it assume debts of the Confederacy, nor debt that the individual Confederate states incurred during the rebellion. Many Republicans claimed that if the Democrats were to regain power, they would do exactly that, repudiating federal debt and assuming that of the rebels. Despite disagreement on other facets of Reconstruction, Randall stood firmly with the Republicans (and most Northern Democrats) on the debt.

As <a href="Impeachment%20in%20the%20United%20States">impeachment</a> proceedings began <a href="Impeachment%20of%20Andrew%20Johnson">against President Johnson</a>, Randall became one of his leading defenders in the House. Once the House determined to impeach Johnson, Randall worked to direct the investigation to the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20the%20Judiciary">Judiciary Committee</a>, rather than a special committee convened for the purpose, which he believed would be stacked with pro-impeachment members. His efforts were unsuccessful, as were his speeches in favor of the president: Johnson was impeached by a vote of 128 to 47. Johnson was not convicted after his Senate trial, and Randall remained on good terms with him after the president left office.

With Grant, a Republican, <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201868">elected president</a> in 1868, and the <a href="41st%20United%20States%20Congress">41st Congress</a> as Republican-dominated as its immediate predecessors, Randall faced several more years in the minority. He served on the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Financial%20Services">Banking and Currency Committee</a> and began to focus on financial matters, resuming his long-standing policy against the power of banks. This placed Randall in the growing fight over the nature of the nation's currency—those who favored the gold-backed currency were called "hard money" supporters, while the policy of encouraging inflation through coining silver or issuing dollars backed by government bonds ("<a href="United%20States%20Note">greenbacks</a>") was known as "soft money". Although he believed in a gold-backed dollar, Randall was friendly to greenbacks; in general, he favored allowing the amount of currency to remain constant, while replacing bank-issued dollar bills with greenbacks. He also believed the federal government should sell its bonds directly to the public, rather than selling them only to large banks, which then re-sold them at a profit. He was unsuccessful in convincing the Republican majority to adopt any of these measures.

Randall worked with Republicans to shift the source of federal funds from taxes to tariffs. He believed the <a href="Excise%20tax%20in%20the%20United%20States">taxation of alcohol</a> spread the burdens of taxation unfairly, especially as concerned his constituents, who included several distillers. He also believed the <a href="income%20tax">income tax</a>, first enacted during the Civil War, was being administered unfairly, with large refunds often accruing to powerful business interests. On this point, Randall was successful, and the House accepted an amendment that required all cases for refunds over $500 to be tried before a <a href="United%20States%20district%20court">federal district court</a>. He also worked toward the elimination of taxation on tea, coffee, cigars, and matches, all of which Randall believed fell disproportionately on the poor. Relief from taxation made these items cheaper for the average American, while increasing reliance on tariffs helped the industrial owners and workers in Randall's district, as it made foreign products more expensive.

Tariff legislation generally found favor with Randall, which put him more often in alliance with Republicans than Democrats. In the late 1860s and early 1870s, Randall worked to raise tariffs on a wide variety of imported goods. Even so, he sometimes differed with the Republicans when he believed the tariff proposed was too high; biographer Alfred V. House describes Randall's attitude as supporting "higher tariff rates ... largely because he believed that the benefits of such high rates were passed on to the labor population." In 1870, he opposed the <a href="pig%20iron">pig iron</a> tariff as too high, against the wishes of fellow Pennsylvanian <a href="William%20D.%20Kelley">William "Pig Iron" Kelley</a>. Randall called his version of protectionism "incidental protection": he believed that tariffs should be high enough to support the cost of running the government, but only applied to those industries that needed tariff protection to survive foreign competition.

While the Democrats were in the minority, Randall spent much of his time scrutinizing the Republicans' appropriations bills. During the <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant%20presidential%20administration">Grant administration</a>, he questioned thousands of items in the appropriation bills, often gaining the support of Republicans in excising expenditures that were in excess of the departments' needs. He proposed a bill that would end the practice, common at the time, of executive departments spending beyond what they had been appropriated, then petitioning Congress to retroactively approve the spending with a supplemental appropriation; the legislation passed and became law. The supplemental appropriations were typically rushed through at the end of a session with little debate. Reacting to the large grants of land given to railroads, he also sought unsuccessfully to ban all land grants to private corporations.

Investigating appropriations led Randall to focus on financial impropriety in Congress and <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant%20presidential%20administration%20scandals">the Grant administration</a>. The most famous of these was the <a href="Cr%C3%A9dit%20Mobilier%20of%20America%20scandal">Crédit Mobilier scandal</a>. In this scheme, the <a href="Union%20Pacific%20Railroad">Union Pacific Railroad</a> bankrupted itself by overpaying its construction company, the Crédit Mobilier of America. Crédit Mobilier was owned by the railroad's principal shareholders and, as the investigation discovered, several congressmen also owned shares that they had been allowed to purchase at discounted prices. Randall's role in the investigation was limited, but he proposed bills to ban such frauds and sought to impeach Vice President <a href="Schuyler%20Colfax">Schuyler Colfax</a>, who had been implicated in the scandal. Randall was involved with the investigation of several other scandals, as well, including tax fraud by private tax collection contractors (known as the <a href="Sanborn%20incident">Sanborn incident</a>) and fraud in the awarding of postal contracts (the <a href="star%20route%20scandal">star route scandal</a>).

Randall was caught on the wrong side of one scandal in 1873 when Congress passed a retroactive pay increase. On the last day of the term, the <a href="42nd%20United%20States%20Congress">42nd Congress</a> voted to raise its members' pay by 50%, including a raise made retroactive to the beginning of the term. Randall voted for the pay raise, and against the amendment that would have removed the retroactive provision. The law, later known as the <a href="Salary%20Grab%20Act">Salary Grab Act</a>, provoked outrage across the country. Randall defended the Act, saying that an increased salary would "put members of Congress beyond temptation" and reduce fraud. Seeing the unpopularity of the Salary Grab, the incoming <a href="43rd%20United%20States%20Congress">43rd Congress</a> repealed it almost immediately, with Randall voting for repeal.

Democrats remained in the minority when the 43rd Congress convened in 1873. Randall continued his opposition to measures proposed by Republicans, especially those intended to increase the power of the federal government. That term saw the introduction of <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201875">a new civil rights bill</a> with farther-reaching ambitions than any before it. <a href="Enforcement%20Act%20of%201871%20%28third%20act%29">Previous acts</a> had seen the use of federal courts and troops to guarantee that black men and women could not be deprived of their civil rights by any state. Now Senator <a href="Charles%20Sumner">Charles Sumner</a> of Massachusetts proposed a new bill, aimed at requiring equal rights in all <a href="public%20accommodations">public accommodations</a>. When Sumner died in 1874, his bill had not passed, but others from the <a href="Radical%20Republican">radical wing</a> of the Republican Party, including Representative <a href="Benjamin%20Butler%20%28politician%29">Benjamin Butler</a> of Massachusetts, continued to work for its enactment.

Randall stood against this measure, as he had against nearly all Reconstruction laws. A lack of consensus delayed the bill from coming to a vote until the <a href="lame-duck%20session">lame-duck session</a> beginning in December 1874. By that time, disillusionment with the Grant administration and worsening economic conditions had translated into a Democratic victory in <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives%20elections%2C%201874">the mid-term elections</a>. When the <a href="44th%20United%20States%20Congress">44th Congress</a> gathered in March 1875, the House would have a Democratic majority for the first time since the Civil War. In the meantime, the outgoing Republicans made one last effort to pass Sumner's civil rights bill; Randall and other Democrats immediately used parliamentary maneuvers to bring action to a stand-still, hoping to delay passage until the Congress ended. Randall led his caucus in filibustering the bill, at one point remaining on the floor for 72 hours. In the end, the Democrats peeled away some Republican votes, but not enough to defeat the bill, which passed by a vote of 162 to 100. Despite the defeat, Randall's filibuster increased his prominence in the eyes of his Democratic colleagues.

As Democrats took control of the House in 1875, Randall was considered among the candidates for <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the House</a>. Many in the caucus hesitated, however, believing Randall to be too close to railroad interests and uncertain on the money question. His leadership in the Salary Grab may have harmed him, as well. Randall was also occupied by an intra-party battle with <a href="William%20A.%20Wallace">William A. Wallace</a> for control of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party. Wallace, who had been elected to the United States Senate in 1874, was weakened by rumors that he had taken bribes from the railroads while a member of the State Senate. Randall wanted control of the Democratic machine statewide, and the Wallace faction's vulnerability on the bribery rumors provided the opportunity. In January 1875, he had friends in the state legislature begin an investigation into Wallace's clique, which ultimately turned state Democratic leaders against the senator. At the state Democratic convention in September 1875, Randall (with the help of his old ally, Squire McMullen) triumphed, putting his men in control of the state party.

In the meantime, the divisions in the state party proved ruinous for Randall's chances at the Speaker's chair. Instead, the Democrats decided on <a href="Michael%20C.%20Kerr">Michael C. Kerr</a> of Indiana, who was elected. Randall was instead named chairman of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Appropriations">Appropriations Committee</a>. In that post, he focused on reducing the government's spending, and cut the budget by $30,000,000, despite opposition from the Republican Senate. Kerr's health was fragile, and he was often absent from sessions, but Randall refused to take his place as speaker on a temporary basis, preferring to concentrate on his appropriations work. Kerr and Randall began to work more closely together through 1876, but Kerr died in August of that year, leaving the Speakership vacant once again.

After Kerr's death, Randall was the consensus choice of the Democratic caucus, and was elected to the Speakership when Congress returned to Washington on December 2, 1876. He assumed the chair at a tumultuous time, as <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201876">the presidential election</a> had just concluded the previous month with no clear winner. The Democratic candidate, <a href="Samuel%20J.%20Tilden">Samuel J. Tilden</a> of New York, had 184 <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">electoral votes</a>, just shy of the 185 needed for victory. <a href="Rutherford%20B.%20Hayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a>, the Republican, had 163; the remaining 22 votes were in doubt.

Randall spent early December in conference with Tilden while committees examined the votes from the disputed states. The counts of the disputed ballots were inconclusive, with each of the states in question producing two sets of returns: one signed by Democratic officials, the other by Republicans, each claiming victory for their man. By January 1877, with the question still unresolved, Congress and President Grant agreed to submit the matter to a bipartisan <a href="Electoral%20Commission%20%28United%20States%29">Electoral Commission</a>, which would be authorized to determine the fate of the disputed electoral votes.

Randall supported the idea, believing it the best solution to an intractable problem. The bill passed, providing for a commission of five representatives, five senators, and five Supreme Court justices. To ensure partisan balance, there would be seven Democrats and seven Republicans; the fifteenth member was to be a Supreme Court justice chosen by the other four on the commission (themselves two Republicans and two Democrats). Justice <a href="David%20Davis%20%28Supreme%20Court%20justice%29">David Davis</a>, an independent respected by both parties, was expected to be their choice, but he upset the careful planning by accepting election to the Senate by the state of Illinois and refusing to serve on the commission. The remaining Supreme Court justices were all Republicans and, with the addition of Justice <a href="Joseph%20P.%20Bradley">Joseph P. Bradley</a> to the place intended for Davis, the commission had an 8–7 Republican majority. Randall nevertheless favored the compromise, even voting in favor of it in the roll call vote (the Speaker usually does not vote). The commission met and awarded all of the disputed ballots to Hayes by an 8–7 party-line vote.

Democrats were outraged, and many demanded that they filibuster the final count in the House. Randall did not commit, but permitted the House to take recesses several times, delaying the decision. As the March 4 inauguration day approached, leaders of both parties met at <a href="Wormley%27s%20Hotel">Wormley's Hotel</a> in Washington to negotiate <a href="Compromise%20of%201877">a compromise</a>. Republicans promised that, in exchange for Democratic acquiescence in the Commission's decision, Hayes would order federal troops to withdraw from the South and accept the election of Democratic governments in the remaining "<a href="Redeemers">unredeemed</a>" states there. The Democratic leadership, including Randall, agreed and the filibuster ended.

Randall returned to Washington in March 1877 at the start of the <a href="45th%20United%20States%20Congress">45th Congress</a> and was reelected Speaker. As the session began, many in the Democratic caucus were determined to repeal the <a href="Specie%20Payment%20Resumption%20Act">Specie Payment Resumption Act</a> of 1875. That Act, passed when Republicans last controlled the House, was intended to gradually withdraw all greenbacks from circulation, replacing them with dollars backed in specie (i.e., gold or silver). With the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201873">elimination of the silver dollar in 1873</a>, this would effectively return the United States to the <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a> for the first time since before the Civil War. Randall, who had voted against the act in 1875, agreed to let the House vote on its repeal, which narrowly passed. The Senate, still controlled by Republicans, declined to act on the bill.

The attempt at repeal did not end the controversy over silver. Democratic Representative <a href="Richard%20P.%20Bland">Richard P. Bland</a> of Missouri proposed a bill that would require the United States to buy as much silver as miners could sell the government and strike it into coins, a system that would increase the money supply and aid debtors. In short, silver miners would sell the government metal worth fifty to seventy cents, and receive back a silver dollar. Randall allowed the bill to come to the floor for an up-or-down vote during a special session in November 1877: the result was its passage by a vote of 163 to 34 (with 94 members absent). The pro-silver idea cut across party lines, and <a href="William%20B.%20Allison">William B. Allison</a>, a Republican from Iowa, led the effort in the Senate. Allison offered an amendment in the Senate requiring the purchase of two to four million dollars per month of silver, but not allowing private deposit of silver at the mints. Thus, the <a href="seignorage">seignorage</a>, or difference between the face value of the coin and the worth of the metal contained within it accrued to the government's credit, not private citizens. President Hayes vetoed the bill, but Congress overrode the veto, and the <a href="Bland%E2%80%93Allison%20Act">Bland–Allison Act</a> became law.

As the 1880 presidential elections approached, many Democrats remained convinced Tilden had been robbed of the presidency in 1876. In the House, Tilden supporter <a href="Clarkson%20Nott%20Potter">Clarkson Nott Potter</a> of New York sought an investigation into the 1876 election in Florida and Louisiana, hoping that evidence of Republican malfeasance would harm that party's candidate in 1880. The Democratic caucus, including Randall, unanimously endorsed the idea, and the committee convened in May 1878. Some in the caucus wished to investigate the entire election, but Randall and the more moderate members worked to limit the committee's reach to the two disputed states.

Randall left no doubt about his sympathies when he assigned members to the committee, stacking it with Hayes's enemies from both parties. The committee's investigation had the opposite of the Democrats' intended effect, uncovering telegrams from Tilden's nephew, <a href="William%20Tilden%20Pelton">William Tilden Pelton</a>, offering bribes to Southern Republicans in the disputed states to help Tilden claim their votes. The Pelton telegrams were in code, which the committee was able to decode; Republicans had also sent ciphered dispatches, but the committee was unable to decode them. The ensuing excitement fizzled out by June 1878 as the Congress went into recess.

As the <a href="46th%20United%20States%20Congress">46th Congress</a> convened in 1879, the Democratic caucus was reduced, but they still held a plurality of seats. The new House contained 152 Democrats, 139 Republicans, and 20 independents, most of whom were affiliated with the <a href="Greenback%20Party">Greenback Party</a>. Many of Randall's fellow Democrats differed with him over protectionism and his lack of support for Southern railroad subsidies, and considered choosing <a href="Joseph%20Clay%20Stiles%20Blackburn">Joseph Clay Stiles Blackburn</a> of Kentucky as their nominee for Speaker, instead. Several other Southerners' names were floated, too, as anti-Randall Democrats tried to coalesce around a single candidate; in the end, none could be found and the caucus chose Randall as their nominee with 107 votes out of 152. With some Democrats not yet present, however, the Democrats began to fear that the Republicans and Greenbackers would strike a deal to combine their votes to elect <a href="James%20A.%20Garfield">James A. Garfield</a> of Ohio as Speaker. When the time for the vote came, however, Garfield refused to make any compromises with the third-party men, and Randall and the Democrats were able to organize the House once more.

Randall's determination to cut spending, combined with Southern Democrats' desire to reduce federal power in their home states, led the House to pass an army appropriation bill with a <a href="Rider%20%28legislation%29">rider</a> that repealed the <a href="Enforcement%20Acts">Enforcement Acts</a>, which had been used to suppress the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>. The Enforcement Acts, passed during Reconstruction over Democratic opposition, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race. Hayes was determined to preserve the law protecting black voters, and he vetoed the appropriation. The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider. Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was repeated three times more. Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Enforcement Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were curtailed. Randall's role in the process was limited, but the Democrats' failure to force Hayes's acquiescence weakened his appeal as a potential presidential candidate in 1880.

As the 1880 elections approached, Randall had two goals: to increase his control of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, and to nominate Tilden for president. His efforts at the former in 1875 had been successful, but Senator William Wallace's faction was again growing powerful. If he wanted to hold the Speakership, as well as to wield influence in the next presidential canvass, Randall believed he must have a united state party behind him. To that end, Randall spent much of his time outside of Congress travelling around his home state to line up support at the state convention in 1880. Some of his allies' enthusiasm backfired against him, however, after McMullen and some supporters broke up an anti-Randall meeting in Philadelphia's 5th ward with such violence that one man was left dead.

When the state convention gathered in April 1880, Randall was confident of victory, but soon found that the Wallace faction outnumbered his. Wallace's majority scrambled the party's organization in Philadelphia and, although some Randall supporters received seats, the majority owed allegiance to the senator. Despite the defeat, Randall pressed on for Tilden, both in Pennsylvania and elsewhere. As rumors circulated that Tilden's health would keep him from running again, Randall remained a loyal Tilden man up to the <a href="1880%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">national convention</a> that June. After the first ballot, the New York delegation released a letter from Tilden in which he withdrew from consideration. Randall hoped for the ex-Tilden delegates to rally to him. Many did so, and Randall surged to second place on the second ballot, but the momentum had shifted to another candidate, Major General <a href="Winfield%20Scott%20Hancock">Winfield Scott Hancock</a>. Nearly all of the delegates shifted to Hancock, and he was nominated.

Randall believed he had been betrayed by many he had thought would support him, but carried on regardless in support of his party's nominee. Hancock (who remained on active duty) and the Republican nominee, James A. Garfield, did not campaign directly, in keeping with the customs of that time, but campaigns were conducted by other party members, including Randall. Speaking in Pennsylvania and around the <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">Midwest</a>, Randall did his best to rally the people to Hancock against Garfield, but without success. Garfield was elected with 214 electoral votes—including those of Pennsylvania. Worse still for Randall, Garfield's victory had swept the Republicans back into a majority in the House, meaning Randall's time as Speaker was at an end.

When Randall returned to Washington in 1881 to begin his term in the <a href="47th%20United%20States%20Congress">47th Congress</a>, the legislature was controlled by Republicans. After <a href="Assassination%20of%20James%20A.%20Garfield">Garfield's assassination</a> later that year, Vice President <a href="Chester%20A.%20Arthur">Chester A. Arthur</a> assumed the presidency. Arthur, like most Republicans, favored high tariffs, but he sought to simplify the tariff structure and to reduce excise taxes. Randall, who had returned to his seat on the Appropriations Committee, favored the president's plan, and was among the few Democrats in the House to support it. The bill that emerged from the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Ways%20and%20Means">Ways and Means Committee</a>, dominated by protectionists, provided for only a 10 percent reduction. After conference with the Senate, the resulting bill had an even smaller effect, reducing tariffs by an average of 1.47 percent. It passed both houses narrowly on March 3, 1883, the last full day of the 47th Congress; Arthur signed <a href="Tariff%20of%201883">the measure</a> into law. Toward the end, Randall took less part in the debate, feeling the tension between his supporters in the House, who wanted more reductions, and his constituents at home, who wanted less.

The Democrats recaptured the House after the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives%20elections%2C%201882">1882 elections</a>, but the incoming majority in the <a href="48th%20United%20States%20Congress">48th Congress</a> was divided on tariffs, with Randall's protectionist faction in the minority. The new Democratic caucus was more Southern and Western than in previous Congresses, and contained many new members who were unfamiliar with Randall. This led many to propose selecting a Speaker more in line with their own views, rather than returning Randall to the office. Randall's attempt to canvass the incoming representatives was further hampered by an attack of the <a href="gout">gout</a>. In the end, <a href="John%20G.%20Carlisle">John G. Carlisle</a> of Kentucky, an advocate of tariff reform, bested Randall in a poll of the Democratic caucus by a vote of 104 to 53.

Carlisle selected <a href="William%20Ralls%20Morrison">William Ralls Morrison</a>, another tariff reformer, to lead the Ways and Means committee, but allowed Randall to take charge of Appropriations. Morrison's committee produced a bill proposing tariff reductions of 20%; Randall opposed the idea from the start, as did the Republicans. Another bout of illness kept Randall away from Congress at a crucial time in April 1884, and the tariff bill passed a procedural hurdle by just two votes. Two days later, Randall's Appropriations committee reported several funding bills with his support. Many Democrats who had voted for Morrison's tariff were thereby reminded that Randall had the power to defeat spending that was important to them; when the final vote came, enough switched sides to join with Republicans in defeating the reform 156 to 151.

As in 1880, the contest for the Democratic nomination for president in 1884 began under the shadow of Tilden. Declining health forced Tilden's withdrawal by June 1884, and Randall felt free to pursue his own chance at the presidency. He gathered some of the Pennsylvania delegates to his cause, but by the time the convention assembled in July, most of the former Tilden adherents had gathered around New York governor <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a>. Early in the convention, Randall met with <a href="Daniel%20Manning">Daniel Manning</a>, Cleveland's campaign manager, and soon thereafter Randall's delegates were instructed to cast their votes for Cleveland. As his biographer, House, wrote, the "actual bargain struck between Randall and Manning is not known, but ... events would seem to show that Randall was promised control of federal <a href="Spoils%20system">patronage</a> in Pennsylvania."

Cleveland's campaign made extensive use of Randall, as he made speeches for Cleveland in New England, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, New York, and Connecticut, mainly in places where potential voters needed to be reassured that the Democrats did not want to lower the tariff so much that they would lose their jobs. In a close election, Cleveland was elected over his Republican opponent, James G. Blaine. Randall also took two tours of the South in 1884 after the election. Although, he claimed the trips to be of a personal nature, they generated speculation that Randall was gathering support for another run at the Speakership in 1885.

As the <a href="49th%20United%20States%20Congress">49th Congress</a> gathered in 1885, Cleveland's position on the tariff was still largely unknown. Randall declined to challenge Carlisle for Speaker, busying himself instead with the federal patronage in Pennsylvania and continued leadership of the Appropriations committee. In February 1886, Morrison, still the chairman of Ways and Means, proposed a bill to decrease the surplus by buying and cancelling $10 million worth of federal bonds each month. Cleveland opposed the plan, and Randall joined 13 Democrats and most Republicans in defeating it. Later that year, however, Cleveland supported Morrison's attempt to reduce the tariff. Again, Republicans and Randall's protectionist bloc combined to sink the measure. In the lame-duck session of 1887, Randall attempted a compromise tariff that would eliminate <a href="Duty%20%28economics%29">duties</a> on some raw materials while also dispensing with excises on tobacco and some liquors. The bill attracted some support from Southern Democrats and Randall's protectionists, but Republicans and the rest of the Democratic caucus rejected it.

The tariff fight continued into the <a href="50th%20United%20States%20Congress">50th Congress</a>, which opened in 1887, in which Democrats retained control of the House, with a reduced majority. By that time, Cleveland had openly sided with the tariff reformers and backed the proposals introduced in 1888 by Representative <a href="Roger%20Q.%20Mills">Roger Q. Mills</a> of Texas. Mills had replaced Morrison at Ways and Means after the latter's defeat for reelection, and was as much in favor of tariff reform as the Illinoisan had been. Mills's bill would make small cuts to tariffs on raw materials, but relatively deeper cuts to those on manufactured goods; Randall, representing a manufacturing district, opposed it immediately. Randall was again ill and absent from the House when the Mills tariff passed by a 162 to 149 vote. The Senate, now Republican-controlled, refused to consider the bill, and it died with the 50th Congress in 1889.

Mills's and Cleveland's defeat on the tariff bill could be considered a victory for Randall, but the vote showed how isolated the former Speaker's protectionist ideas now made him in his party: only four Democrats voted against the tariff reductions. The state party likewise turned against Randall and toward <a href="free%20trade">free trade</a>, adopting a pro-tariff revision platform at the 1888 state Democratic convention. At the same time, Randall seemingly reversed his long-standing commitment to fiscal economy by voting with the Republicans to override Cleveland's veto of the <a href="Dependent%20and%20Disability%20Pension%20Act">Dependent and Disability Pension Act</a>. The Act would have given a pension to every Union veteran (or their widows) who claimed he could no longer perform physical labor, regardless of whether his disability was war-related. Cleveland's veto was in line with his record of small-government cost-cutting, with which Randall would normally have sympathized. Randall, perhaps in an effort to gain favor with veterans in his district, joined the Republicans in an unsuccessful attempt to override Cleveland's veto. Another possibility proposed by biographer House is that Randall saw the federal budget surplus as reason to cut tariffs; by increasing federal spending, he hoped to decrease the surplus and maintain the need for high tariffs. Whatever the reason, the attempt failed and left Randall further alienated from his fellow Democrats.

Randall's positions on tariffs and pensions had made him, according to "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", "a practical Republican" by 1888. Voting with the opposing party so frequently was an effective tactic, as he faced only token Republican opposition for reelection that year. Randall's health continued to decline. When <a href="51st%20United%20States%20Congress">the new congress</a> began in 1889, he received special permission to be sworn into office from his bed, where he was confined. The new Speaker, Republican <a href="Thomas%20Brackett%20Reed">Thomas Brackett Reed</a> of Maine, appointed Randall to the Rules and Appropriations committees, but he had no impact during that term.

On April 12, 1890, Randall died of <a href="colon%20cancer">colon cancer</a> in his Washington home. He had recently joined the <a href="National%20Presbyterian%20Church%23First%20Presbyterian%20Church">First Presbyterian Church</a> in the capital, and his funeral was held there. He was buried in <a href="Laurel%20Hill%20Cemetery">Laurel Hill Cemetery</a> in Philadelphia. Elected every two years from 1862 to 1888, Randall was the only prominent Democrat continuously on the national scene between those years. In an obituary, the Bulletin of the American Iron and Steel Association described the congressman who had consistently protected their industry: "Not a great scholar, nor a great orator, nor a great writer, Samuel J. Randall was nevertheless a man of sterling common sense, quick perceptions, great courage, broad views and extraordinary capacity for work." The only scholarly works on his life are a master's thesis by Sidney I. Pomerantz, written in 1932, and a doctoral dissertation by Albert V. House, from 1934; both are unpublished. His papers were collected by the University of Pennsylvania library in the 1950s and he has been the subject of several journal articles (many by House), but awaits a full scholarly biography.

Walter de Coutances

Walter de Coutances (died 16 November 1207) was a medieval <a href="Anglo-Normans">Anglo-Norman</a> <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lincoln">bishop</a> of <a href="diocese%20of%20Lincoln">Lincoln</a> and <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Rouen">archbishop</a> of <a href="diocese%20of%20Rouen">Rouen</a>. He began his royal service in the government of <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II</a>, serving as a vice-<a href="chancellor">chancellor</a>. He also accumulated a number of ecclesiastical offices, becoming successively <a href="canon%20%28priest%29">canon</a> of <a href="Rouen%20Cathedral">Rouen Cathedral</a>, treasurer of Rouen, and <a href="Archdeacon%20of%20Oxford">archdeacon</a> of <a href="diocese%20of%20Oxford">Oxford</a>. King Henry sent him on a number of diplomatic missions and finally rewarded him with the bishopric of Lincoln in 1183. He did not remain there long, for he was <a href="translation%20%28ecclesiastical%29">translated</a> to Rouen in late 1184.

When <a href="Richard%20I%20of%20England">Richard I</a>, King Henry's son, became king in 1189, Coutances absolved Richard for his rebellion against his father and invested him as Duke of Normandy. He then accompanied Richard to Sicily as the king began the <a href="Third%20Crusade">Third Crusade</a>, but events in England prompted Richard to send the archbishop back to England to mediate between <a href="William%20Longchamp">William Longchamp</a>, the <a href="justiciar">justiciar</a> whom Richard had left in charge of the kingdom, and Prince <a href="John%20of%20England">John</a>, Richard's younger brother. Coutances succeeded in securing a peace between Longchamp and John, but further actions by Longchamp led to the justiciar's expulsion from England, replaced in his role by Coutances, even though he never formally used the title. He remained in the office until late 1193, when he was summoned to Germany by the king, who was being held in captivity there. Coutances became a hostage for the final payment of Richard's ransom on the king's release in February 1194.

Coutances took no further part in English government after returning from Germany. Instead he became involved in Norman affairs, including a dispute with Richard over the ownership of <a href="Les%20Andelys">Andely</a> manor, an archiepiscopal property that Richard desired as a fortress. Eventually the archbishop surrendered it to the king in return for two other manors and the seaport of Dieppe. Richard went on to build the <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20Gaillard">castle of Gaillard</a> on the former archiepiscopal manor. After Richard's death, Coutances invested Prince John as Duke of Normandy, but was forced to pay 2,100 <a href="Angevin%20pound">Angevin pound</a>s to secure contested rights from the new king. After John lost control of Normandy in 1204, the archbishop did not resist the new government of King <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20France">Philip II of France</a>. Coutances died in November 1207 and was buried in his cathedral.

Coutances was born in <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, to Reinfrid and Gonilla. His brother was <a href="Roger%20fitzReinfrid">Roger fitzReinfrid</a>, a layman and royal justice during the reign of King Henry II of England. Although the medieval chronicler and churchman <a href="Gerald%20of%20Wales">Gerald of Wales</a> related that his friend was descended from <a href="Troy">Trojan</a> heroes who escaped the <a href="Trojan%20War%23The%20Sack%20of%20Troy">Sack of Troy</a> and ended up in Cornwall, that was a flattering invention on Gerald's part. Coutances' family was of the knightly class, and probably from Normandy originally.

Coutances was usually given the title of "magister", which signified that he had received an education in a school; most likely he attended the <a href="University%20of%20Paris">schools of Paris</a>. Gerald of Wales said that Coutances was dedicated to learning, and considered him to be a talented courtier.

Coutances started his career as a clerk to King Henry II of England in the royal chamber. He probably owed the position to his brother, who was already in royal service. Coutances may have been associated with the <a href="House%20of%20Beaumont">Beaumont family faction</a> at court before beginning work for the king, but this is not certain.

By 1169 Coutances held a canonry in Rouen Cathedral. During the 1170s a group of royal clerks rose to prominence, among them Coutances, <a href="Walter%20Map">Walter Map</a>, <a href="Ralph%20Diceto">Ralph Diceto</a>, <a href="John%20of%20Oxford">John of Oxford</a>, <a href="Richard%20of%20Ilchester">Richard of Ilchester</a>, and <a href="Geoffrey%20Ridel%20%28bishop%20of%20Ely%29">Geoffrey Ridel</a>. Coutances was the chaplain to <a href="Henry%20the%20Young%20King">Henry the Young King</a>, eldest living son of King Henry, but when the younger Henry <a href="Revolt%20of%201173%E2%80%931174">rebelled</a> against his father in 1173, Coutances returned to King Henry's service. He became <a href="Archdeacon%20of%20Oxford">Archdeacon of Oxford</a>, perhaps by 1173, certainly by 14 March 1176. He was named vice-chancellor when Ralph de Warneville became <a href="Lord%20Chancellor%20of%20England">Chancellor</a> of England, which occurred in 1173. In 1176 and 1177, King Henry sent Coutances on diplomatic missions to Flanders and the French royal court. <a href="Arnulf%20of%20Lisieux">Arnulf</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lisieux">Bishop of Lisieux</a>, alleged that Henry allowed Coutances to use all the administrative machinery of Normandy to drive Arnulf from his diocese, so that Coutances might become bishop there. This happened in early 1178, but the only real evidence for this effort on Coutances' part comes from Arnulf's correspondence, and as Coutances was back in England by July 1178, it does not appear that the attempt was a sustained one.

On his return to England, Coutances was given custody of the abbeys of <a href="Wilton%20Abbey">Wilton</a> and <a href="Ramsey%20Abbey">Ramsey</a>, which were being held by King Henry pending the election of new abbots. He thus acquired the right to collect the abbeys' revenues in the name of the king, who had the <a href="regalian%20right">regalian right</a>s to that income. In 1180 Henry sent Coutances to France on another diplomatic mission. In February 1182 Coutances witnessed King Henry II's will, made before the king travelled to Normandy.

Coutances was elected to the <a href="see%20of%20Lincoln">see of Lincoln</a> on 8 May 1183, selected by King Henry over three other candidates. He was ordained a priest on 11 June 1183 and consecrated bishop on 3 July 1183 at <a href="Angers">Angers</a> by <a href="Richard%20of%20Dover">Richard of Dover</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. He was enthroned at <a href="Lincoln%20Cathedral">Lincoln Cathedral</a> on 11 December 1183. While at Lincoln, Coutances took part in the election of <a href="Baldwin%20of%20Forde">Baldwin of Forde</a> as the new Archbishop of Canterbury, which took place at a council held in Westminster in 1184. Writing about Coutances' time at Lincoln, Gerald of Wales accused the bishop of increasing the debt of the diocese of Lincoln and of squandering its resources. Coutances helped the schools in the city of Lincoln, acting as the patron for scholars such as <a href="John%20of%20Tynemouth%20%28canon%20lawyer%29">John of Tynemouth</a> and <a href="Simon%20of%20Southwell">Simon of Southwell</a>.

On 17 November 1184 Coutances was <a href="Translation%20%28ecclesiastical%29">translated</a> to the <a href="diocese%20of%20Rouen">diocese of Rouen</a>, becoming Archbishop of Rouen. The original election to Rouen had taken place in the summer. King Henry had initially rejected the Rouen cathedral chapter's nominees and put forward three English bishops as the royal candidates. The king also indicated his preference that Coutances be elected, a choice that was confirmed by the pope in November. Coutances hesitated about the translation to Rouen, as the see there was poorer than Lincoln, but as an archbishopric rather than a bishopric it was of a higher status. The medieval chronicler <a href="William%20of%20Newburgh">William of Newburgh</a> wrote that eventually Coutances' ambition overcame his greed, and he agreed to the translation. He was received at Rouen on 3 March 1185. Coutances remained in Henry's service however, and continued attend the royal court frequently. During the final 10 years of Henry's reign, only Ranulf de Glanville witnessed more royal charters, and only William de Humez, the <a href="constable">constable</a>, equalled the 16 charters that Coutances witnessed.

In the later part of 1186, after the death of King Henry's son <a href="Geoffrey%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brittany">Geoffrey</a> – who was Duke of Brittany – King Philip II of France demanded that Geoffrey's daughters be placed in the French king's custody, and that the <a href="duchy%20of%20Brittany">duchy of Brittany</a>, which Geoffrey had ruled in right of his wife, be surrendered into French royal custody. Coutances was one of the negotiators sent by King Henry to secure a settlement, but they had to settle for a temporary truce. In January 1188 Coutances took the cross when he pledged to go on Crusade along with King Henry and King Philip of France.

At <a href="Whitsun">Whitsun</a> in 1189, Coutances was a member of a commission appointed by the papal legate <a href="John%20of%20Anagni">John of Anagni</a> to arbitrate the dispute between King Henry II of England and his son, Richard, who was supported by King Philip II of France. Henry and Richard's conflict stemmed from Richard's desire to secure his inheritance to the throne of England, which he believed his father was trying to give to his youngest brother, John. The commission met near Le Mans. Richard and Philip insisted that Richard should be married to Philip's sister <a href="Alys%2C%20Countess%20of%20the%20Vexin">Alice</a>, that Henry name Richard as Henry's heir, and that Richard's youngest brother John should go on crusade with Richard. Henry rejected those terms, and neither Philip nor Richard would negotiate, even under the legate's threat of an interdict on France.

Shortly after Richard took the throne he sought absolution for his sins in rebelling against his father, from Baldwin of Forde and Coutances. The two archbishops absolved Richard in a ceremony in Sees. Coutances also invested Richard as Duke of Normandy in a ceremony held in Rouen, before accompanying Richard to England, where he participated in the new king's coronation, on 3 September 1189.

In 1189 Coutances held an ecclesiastical synod which legislated, among other things, that the clergy should not hold secular offices, even though Coutances himself had held and continued to hold such offices. On 9 November 1189 Richard appointed Coutances to a commission tasked with deciding the dispute between Baldwin of Forde and the monks of his <a href="cathedral%20chapter">cathedral chapter</a> over Baldwin's plan to create a church dedicated to <a href="Thomas%20Becket">Thomas Becket</a>, the murdered Archbishop of Canterbury, and to staff this church not with monks, but with canons. The monks of Canterbury Cathedral objected to Baldwin's plan, fearing that it was part of a plot to transfer the right of election from the monastic cathedral chapter to the new church's canons. Sitting on the commission with Coutances were <a href="Hugh%20de%20Puiset">Hugh de Puiset</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Durham">Bishop of Durham</a>, <a href="Godfrey%20de%20Lucy">Godfrey de Lucy</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a>, <a href="Hubert%20Walter">Hubert Walter</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Salisbury">Bishop of Salisbury</a>, <a href="Peter%20de%20Leia">Peter de Leia</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20St%20David%27s">Bishop of St David's</a>, <a href="Richard%20fitzNigel">Richard fitzNigel</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20London">Bishop-elect of London</a>, William Longchamp, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Ely">Bishop-elect of Ely</a>, and some abbots. The commission travelled to Canterbury, and on 29 November 1189, managed to secure a compromise between the parties, which lasted until Hubert Walter, by then Archbishop of Canterbury, revived the plan. In the compromise, Baldwin agreed to give up the idea of a new monastic foundation around Canterbury and the monks agreed to submit to the archbishop's authority.

When Richard left England in late 1189, the archbishop accompanied him to Normandy and then to Sicily, where Richard began the Third Crusade. In October 1190, Coutances was one of the negotiators between the city of Messina and the crusaders, and later was a guarantor of the peace treaty between King Richard and <a href="Tancred%20of%20Sicily">Tancred</a>, the <a href="King%20of%20Sicily">King of Sicily</a>. The archbishop was also appointed one of the treasurers of the crusading army.

While Richard was still in Sicily, word reached the king of the disputes between William Longchamp, whom Richard had left in England, and <a href="John%20of%20England">John</a>, Richard's younger brother. On 2 April 1191 Richard sent Coutances back from Sicily to England. The archbishop landed in England on 27 June, after a short detour to Rome. Coutances received a release from his crusading vow, and returned to England in the company of Richard's mother, Queen <a href="Eleanor%20of%20Aquitaine">Eleanor of Aquitaine</a>. He had a number of royal documents authorising him to settle the disputes, and on 28 July a settlement was reached that left Longchamp in control, although John still retained sufficient power to make Longchamp's grip on the government somewhat insecure. In September, however, Longchamp imprisoned Richard's bastard half-brother, <a href="Geoffrey%2C%20Archbishop%20of%20York">Geoffrey, Archbishop of York</a>, who was attempting to return to England after having been banished by the king. The imprisonment renewed memories of the murder of Thomas Becket almost 20 years earlier, and Geoffrey was quickly released. Longchamp was brought to a council, headed by Coutances and a number of the clerical and lay lords of England, which took place on 5 October 1191 at <a href="Loddon%20Bridge">Loddon Bridge</a> on the River Thames. Longchamp was deposed and exiled, largely because Coutances had a royal document ordering the magnates to obey Coutances' if the archbishop's advice was resisted by Longchamp, which it had been. Although the medieval chronicler <a href="Richard%20of%20Devizes">Richard of Devizes</a> accused Coutances of duplicity, and of trying to play both sides against the other, the evidence suggests that Coutances was genuinely trying to solve the dispute in the king's interest. Longchamp fled to Normandy, and he was excommunicated by Coutances.

After Longchamp's exile Coutances was named head of a council of regency, which is sometimes equated to the post of <a href="Chief%20Justiciar">Chief Justiciar</a>, although he never referred to himself as such nor is he titled that in any official document. Most modern historians, however, name him as justiciar. He held that power until about 25 December 1193, when Hubert Walter was appointed Justiciar.

Coutances had long experience in the <a href="Chancery%20%28medieval%20office%29">chancery</a>, but little experience with judicial matters. Most of his efforts while in the justiciarship were centred on raising Richard's ransom. As evidence of this emphasis on raising money, Coutances sent out few itinerant justices during his time in power. Six groups of justices were sent out in 1192, but in 1193 none were sent out, and even the justices based in Westminster held few sessions. Of those justices appointed, like his predecessor in the justiciarship, Coutances used justices from a wide range of backgrounds, and many of those sent out on itinerent rounds were local to the area, rather than the increasingly professional justices used under Coutances' successor Hubert Walter. The justiciarship during this period was less connected to justice and was more closely tied to the <a href="Exchequer">Exchequer</a>, or treasury of England, and most of the power in the office derived from its control of the Exchequer.

A new note in Coutances' administration was his custom of issuing writs not in his own name, as had previously been the practice, but in the king's name. The archbishop also stressed that his decisions were made with the advice and consent of many of the leading nobles of the realm, as well as the <a href="Exchequer">barons of the Exchequer</a>. This was a reaction against Longchamp's authoritarian method of government.

The archbishop supervised the election of a new Archbishop of Canterbury, as Baldwin of Forde had died while on Crusade in 1190. Although both Longchamp and Coutances were considered as possible candidates and rivals for the see, the cathedral chapter of Canterbury elected the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Bath">Bishop of Bath</a>, <a href="Reginald%20Fitz%20Jocelin">Reginald fitzJocelin</a>, in November 1191. Reginald died a month later and the see remained vacant until March 1193, when the king's candidate, Hubert Walter, was elected.

During 1191 the citizens of the city of London managed to acquire from Coutances and Prince John the recognition that the city was self-governing, something they had been attempting to secure for a number of years. This however, was not the grant of a complete charter of liberties, which did not occur until 1199. In February 1193 Coutances summoned a council to Oxford, to address problems of administration and defence after the recently received news of Richard's captivity in Germany. The council also took oaths of fealty to Richard. Prince John, however, hearing that Richard was in captivity, immediately went to France and swore homage to King Philip for Richard's lands, and then returned to England and raised a rebellion. Coutances proceeded to besiege <a href="Windsor%20Castle">Windsor Castle</a>, which was held by Prince John's men. When John heard that Richard was going to be freed, he left England and went to France.

In February 1194 Coutances was in Germany, at the court of the German emperor, along with Longchamp, who brought letters to Richard, still in captivity. On 4 February, Coutances became a hostage to the German emperor as surety for the payment of the outstanding portion of Richard's ransom, and the king was released. The king never paid the final instalment of his ransom, and the archbishop had to pay 10,000 <a href="mark%20%28money%29">marks</a> for his own release. From that point onwards Coutances was no longer involved with English politics or government, and spent the rest of his career on Norman affairs. His record of charter witnessing bears this out; between 1189 and 1194 Coutances was among the most prolific of the witnesses to the king's English charters, but not after 1194.

Coutances returned to Normandy, and in December 1195 attempted to secure compensation for the losses his archdiocese had sustained in the warfare between King Richard and King Phillip. He sought compensation from both kings but obtained no satisfaction, and felt so ill-treated by the kings that he abandoned his see. The English and the French kings had required clergymen to guarantee the January 1196 <a href="Treaty%20of%20Louviers">Treaty of Louviers</a> that the two kings arranged for themselves, with Richard nominating Coutances as his surety, or guarantor that the conditions of the treaty would be fulfilled. Part of the treaty laid out that if the archbishop laid an <a href="interdict">interdict</a> or <a href="excommunicate">excommunicate</a>d anyone in the lands of King Philip or any subject of King Richard in the archdiocese of Rouen, then the archiepiscopal manor of <a href="Andeli">Andeli</a> should be forfeit to either king until after a special tribunal had determined if the archbishop's punishment was valid.

When Coutances returned to his diocese in July 1196, he found that the king had seized the manor of Andely independently of the treaty provisions, and when the archbishop refused to relinquish it to the king, Richard began to fortify the manor. He also built a castle there, now <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20Gaillard">Château Gaillard</a>. On 7 November 1196, Coutances set off for Rome, to protest the seizure to the pope. Richard sent a royal embassy, and eventually a settlement was reached. The archbishop was ordered to remove the interdict he had placed on the duchy, and in return for the manor received two others and the seaport of <a href="Dieppe">Dieppe</a>. The various lands that Coutances' received in exchange for Andely were worth £1,405 a year. This episode marked the end of Coutances' service to the Angevin kings; for the rest of his life the archbishop focused on protecting and guarding the archiepiscopal properties and rights.

When Richard died on 6 April 1199, the archbishop invested Richard's youngest brother John as duke of Normandy on 25 April 1199. At the ceremony, John pledged to protect the Norman church, and soon afterwards confirmed the grant of Dieppe and the other manors to the archdiocese. John contested the right of the archbishop to some jurisdictional rights however, as well as forest rights, forcing Coutances to pay 2,100 Angevin pounds to secure most of the contested rights. In May 1200, Coutances was involved in the peace treaty of Le Goulet between King John and King Philip of France, but took no active part in the Angevin defence of Normandy.

In September 1201 one of Coutances' <a href="suffragan%20bishop">suffragan bishop</a>s, Lisiard, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20S%C3%A9es">Bishop of Sées</a> died. King John objected when the cathedral chapter attempted to elect one of their own members as his successor. Coutances refused to recognise the result of the election, and the chapter divided into two parties, one favouring the elected chapter member, the other party another choice. Both parties appealed to the papacy, who eventually approved of the election of the <a href="Archdeacon%20of%20S%C3%A9es">Archdeacon of Sées</a>, Silvester. Coutances had the right to consecrate the bishop however, and he refused to do so, arguing that the king's choice had been disregarded. Pope <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20III">Innocent III</a> then ordered another Norman archbishop to consecrate Silvester, but the king refused to allow Silvester to take possession of his see. This led Innocent to order Normandy laid under an interdict, but eventually Silvester was allowed to take possession of Sees.

In May 1202 Pope Innocent III wrote to Coutances, urging him to impose religious punishments on any rebels against King John's rule in the duchy of Normandy. When John lost the duchy in 1204, Coutances did not resist the government of King Philip II, although he did not make his complete peace with Philip until March 1207. In 1206–1207, Coutances, along with his suffragan bishops, petitioned Philip for special legal procedures relating to patronage, which Philip granted.

Although Coutances was absent from Rouen for most of the period between 1190 and 1194, he remained an active archbishop. He secured the continued immunity of clergy from secular jurisdiction, and supervised the administration of the archdiocese. He began the custom of keeping records in registers of episcopal judgements from about 1200, and he appointed the first officials of Rouen. He also oversaw the rebuilding of <a href="Rouen%20Cathedral">Rouen Cathedral</a>, which had begun in 1155, and restarted the work after a fire in 1200. His relations with his cathedral chapter were evidently excellent, as they remembered him as "a magnificent benefactor of the church of Rouen".

Coutances died on 16 November 1207 and was buried at Rouen Cathedral, in the chapel of Saints Peter and Paul. The inventory of his personal possessions made after his death included a large number of jewels and vestments. He also owned a large library, which contained not only religious works but also legal texts on canon law and works of classical authors such as <a href="Juvenal">Juvenal</a> and <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a>.

Coutances' nephew, <a href="John%20of%20Coutances">John of Coutances</a>, became Archdeacon of Oxford and <a href="Dean%20of%20Rouen">Dean of Rouen</a> under Walter's influence, and later <a href="Bishop%20of%20Worcester">Bishop of Worcester</a>. Other nephews were William, successively a canon at Lincoln Cathedral and an archdeacon at Rouen, and Richard, also an archdeacon at Rouen.

The historian <a href="John%20Gillingham">John Gillingham</a> called Coutances "one of the great fixers" of his time. Two other historians have argued that it was probably Coutances' judgement and stability that persuaded the king to trust him. The medieval poet <a href="John%20of%20Hauville">John of Hauville</a> dedicated a satirical poem in 1184 to Coutances called <a href="Architrenius">Architrenius</a>. It was on the tribulations of a poor scholar.

1995 Pacific Grand Prix

The 1995 Pacific Grand Prix (formally the II Pacific Grand Prix) was a <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> motor race held on 22 October 1995 at the <a href="Okayama%20International%20Circuit">TI Circuit</a>, <a href="Aida%2C%20Okayama">Aida</a>, Japan. It was the fifteenth round of the <a href="1995%20Formula%20One%20season">1995 Formula One season</a>. The 83-lap race was won by <a href="Michael%20Schumacher">Michael Schumacher</a> for the <a href="Benetton%20Formula">Benetton</a> team after starting from third position. <a href="David%20Coulthard">David Coulthard</a>, who started the Grand Prix from <a href="pole%20position">pole position</a>, finished second in a <a href="WilliamsF1">Williams</a> car, with <a href="Damon%20Hill">Damon Hill</a> third in the other Williams. Schumacher's win confirmed him as <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Drivers%27%20Champions">1995 Drivers' Champion</a>, as Hill could not pass Schumacher's points total with only two races remaining. This was also the last race for <a href="Jean-Christophe%20Boullion">Jean-Christophe Boullion</a>.

Hill started the race alongside Coulthard on the front row, amidst pressure from the British media for not being "forceful" enough in battles. Schumacher attempted to drive around the outside of Hill at the first corner, but Hill held Schumacher off as <a href="Jean%20Alesi">Jean Alesi</a>, driving for <a href="Scuderia%20Ferrari">Ferrari</a>, got past both on the inside line to take second position. As a result, Hill dropped down to third and Schumacher dropped down to fifth behind <a href="Gerhard%20Berger">Gerhard Berger</a>. Schumacher managed to get past Alesi and Hill during the first of three <a href="pit%20stop">pit stop</a>s. This allowed him, on a new set of <a href="slick%20tyre">slick tyre</a>s, to close on Coulthard who was on a two-stop strategy. Schumacher opened up a gap of 21 seconds by lapping two seconds faster per lap than Coulthard, so that when his third stop came, he still led the race.

The race, originally scheduled to be held as the third round of the <a href="1995%20Formula%20One%20season">season</a> on 16 April 1995, was moved to October as the local infrastructure and communications were badly damaged from the <a href="Great%20Hanshin%20earthquake">Great Hanshin earthquake</a>.

Heading into the 15th race of the season, <a href="Benetton%20Formula">Benetton</a> driver <a href="Michael%20Schumacher">Michael Schumacher</a> was leading the <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Drivers%27%20Champions">Drivers' Championship</a> with 82 points; <a href="WilliamsF1">Williams</a> driver <a href="Damon%20Hill">Damon Hill</a> was second on 55 points, 27 points behind Schumacher. A maximum of 30 points were available for the remaining three races, which meant that Hill could still win the title. Schumacher only needed a fourth-place finish to become Drivers' Champion as, even if Hill won, Schumacher would be more than 20 points ahead of Hill with two races remaining. Behind Hill and Schumacher in the Drivers' Championship, <a href="David%20Coulthard">David Coulthard</a> was third on 43 points in a Williams, with <a href="Johnny%20Herbert">Johnny Herbert</a> and <a href="Jean%20Alesi">Jean Alesi</a> both on 40 points. In the <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Constructors%27%20Champions">Constructors' Championship</a>, Benetton were leading on 112 points and Williams were second on 92 points, with a maximum of 48 points available. In the two weeks leading up to the race, there was heavy criticism towards Damon Hill, with pundits feeling that Hill had not been "forceful" enough in his battle at the <a href="1995%20European%20Grand%20Prix">European Grand Prix</a> against Schumacher. In an interview leading up to the race, part-time <a href="Equipe%20Ligier">Ligier</a> driver <a href="Martin%20Brundle">Martin Brundle</a> said:

Schumacher, his title-rival, said that Hill made "half-hearted attempts" to overtake, which led to him "getting into trouble". The comments were prompted after a series of battles between Hill and Schumacher in previous race meetings, most notably at the <a href="1995%20Belgian%20Grand%20Prix">Belgian Grand Prix</a>, where Hill accused Schumacher of blocking him. At a <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Internationale%20de%20l%27Automobile">Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile</a> (FIA) <a href="FIA%20World%20Motor%20Sport%20Council">World Motor Sport Council</a> meeting on October 19 to discuss driver etiquette, they opted against introducing new rules on the issue. Formula One's <a href="Sport%20governing%20body">governing body</a> emphasised that the <a href="International%20Sporting%20Code">International Sporting Code</a> would be enforced on the basis that drivers are free to drive as they wish "provided they do not deliberately endanger another driver or repeatedly obstruct him on a straight", following incidents during the year involving Hill and Schumacher.

Williams were favourites to win the race due to the nature of the track—their <a href="Williams%20FW17">Williams FW17</a> car was more suited to <a href="downforce">high-downforce</a> tracks like Aida, and thus had the advantage over Benetton. In an attempt to match the pace of the Williams cars, Benetton introduced a revised <a href="rear%20suspension">rear suspension</a> geometry to the <a href="Benetton%20B195">Benetton B195</a> for the race.

There were five driver changes heading into the race. Having been in one of the two Ligier cars since the tenth race of the season at <a href="1995%20German%20Grand%20Prix">Germany</a>, Martin Brundle was replaced by <a href="Aguri%20Suzuki">Aguri Suzuki</a> as part of the two sharing the drive for the season. <a href="Jan%20Magnussen">Jan Magnussen</a> was drafted into the <a href="McLaren%20%28racing%29">McLaren</a> team to replace <a href="Mika%20H%C3%A4kkinen">Mika Häkkinen</a> because of the Finn's operation for <a href="appendicitis">appendicitis</a>. The third driver change was <a href="Ukyo%20Katayama">Ukyo Katayama</a>'s return to <a href="Tyrrell%20Racing">Tyrrell</a> after missing the European Grand Prix due to a crash at the <a href="1995%20Portuguese%20Grand%20Prix">Portuguese Grand Prix</a>. <a href="Gianni%20Morbidelli">Gianni Morbidelli</a> returned to the <a href="Footwork%20Arrows">Footwork</a> team replacing <a href="Max%20Papis">Max Papis</a>, while at <a href="Pacific%20Racing">Pacific</a>, <a href="Bertrand%20Gachot">Bertrand Gachot</a> came back to replace <a href="Jean-Denis%20D%C3%A9l%C3%A9traz">Jean-Denis Délétraz</a>, both men having driven for these teams at the start of the season. Délétraz was replaced as he had not made agreed payment instalments to the Pacific team for the privilege of the drive. Pacific had originally intended to run local driver <a href="Katsumi%20Yamamoto">Katsumi Yamamoto</a> in place of Délétraz, but he was not granted an <a href="FIA%20Super%20Licence">FIA Super Licence</a> and so Gachot retook the seat. Similarly, the <a href="Forti">Forti</a> team's plans to replace <a href="Roberto%20Moreno">Roberto Moreno</a> with <a href="Hideki%20Noda">Hideki Noda</a> came to nought for the same reason, even though Noda had started three Grands Prix for the <a href="Larrousse">Larrousse</a> team the previous year.

Two practice sessions were held before the race; the first was held on Friday morning and the second on Saturday morning. Both sessions lasted 1 hour and 45 minutes with weather conditions dry throughout. Schumacher set the fastest time in the first session, posting a lap of 1:16.057, three-tenths of a second quicker than Hill and Coulthard, in second and third places respectively. The <a href="Scuderia%20Ferrari">Ferrari</a> cars were fourth and fifth fastest; <a href="Gerhard%20Berger">Gerhard Berger</a> ahead of <a href="Jean%20Alesi">Jean Alesi</a>, with McLaren driver <a href="Mark%20Blundell">Mark Blundell</a> rounding out the top six. Coulthard lapped faster than Schumacher in the second practice session with a time of 1:15.730. Hill was second in the Williams, three-tenths of a second behind Coulthard. <a href="Eddie%20Irvine">Eddie Irvine</a> in the <a href="Jordan%20Grand%20Prix">Jordan</a> car was fourth, seven-tenths behind Coulthard. He was split by the Ferrari cars who were third and fifth; Alesi in front of Berger. The Benetton cars were sixth and seventh; Schumacher in front of Herbert. <a href="Heinz-Harald%20Frentzen">Heinz-Harald Frentzen</a> and <a href="Jean-Christophe%20Boullion">Jean-Christophe Boullion</a> were eighth and tenth in the <a href="Sauber">Sauber</a> cars, with <a href="Rubens%20Barrichello">Rubens Barrichello</a> ninth in the Jordan, two seconds off the pace.

The <a href="List%20of%20motorsport%20terminology%23Q">qualifying session</a> was split into two one-hour sessions; the first was held on Friday afternoon with the second held on Saturday afternoon. The fastest time from either sessions counted towards their final <a href="Standing%20start">grid position</a>. Coulthard clinched his fourth consecutive <a href="pole%20position">pole position</a>, in his Williams, with a time of 1:14.013. He was joined on the front row by teammate Hill, who was two-tenths of a second behind. Schumacher was third in the Benetton, edging closer to the Williams drivers throughout both days of qualifying by steadily reducing the <a href="downforce">downforce</a> on his car. His last run, right at the end of the second session, pressured Coulthard into leaving the pit lane to cover the German. The pole position man thus used an additional set of <a href="slick%20tyres">slick tyres</a>, meaning that out of the allocation of seven sets of slick tyres as set out by the FIA, he had only two sets of brand-new rubber for the race, whereas Schumacher had the advantage of three sets of new rubber. Hill, concerned about starting from the dirty side of the track (the side of the track that is opposite to the <a href="racing%20line">racing line</a>), had only two sets of brand new tyres for the race.

Berger took fourth despite going off into the <a href="Run-off%20area">gravel</a> late in the second part of qualifying. Berger's teammate Alesi was fifth, with Irvine completing the top six for his best qualifying position of the season. Rookie Magnussen qualified 12th, only two places behind teammate Blundell, after not making a mistake in either of the two sessions. Returning drivers Suzuki, Katayama, Morbidelli and Gachot qualified 13th, 17th, 19th and 24th respectively, with the grid covered by 7.392 seconds.

The conditions for the race were dry with the <a href="air%20temperature">air temperature</a> . The drivers took to the track at 09:30 <a href="Japan%20Standard%20Time">JST</a> (<a href="Greenwich%20Mean%20Time">GMT</a> +9) for a 30-minute warm-up session. Both Williams cars maintained their good performance from qualifying; Coulthard had the fastest time of 1:16.831. Hill was third in the other Williams car; Boullion split them in the Sauber for second position. <a href="Olivier%20Panis">Olivier Panis</a> completed the top four in a <a href="Equipe%20Ligier">Ligier</a> car, eight-tenths of a second behind Hill. Hill drove the spare Williams car along the inside of the start–finish straight in an effort to clean up his grid position on the dusty side of the track. Schumacher finished the session in eighth, despite going off the track, damaging his race car in the process. The remote and inaccessible nature of the circuit and the fact that the <a href="1995%20Japanese%20Grand%20Prix">Japanese Grand Prix</a> took place just one week later resulted in a meagre race-day crowd of only 15,000 spectators.

The race started at 14:00 JST. Coulthard, from pole position on the grid, held onto the lead into the first corner. Hill, who started alongside Coulthard, had a bad start. Schumacher attempted to go around the outside of Hill at the first corner, but Hill held Schumacher off. Both drivers ran off the racing line in the process, allowing Alesi through into second place. At the end of lap one, Coulthard led Alesi by 2.8 seconds, with Hill a further three-tenths back. Berger was fourth, with Schumacher demoted to fifth. Bertrand Gachot in the Pacific became the first person to retire from the race with a gearbox problem on lap two. He was followed by Suzuki and Boullion, who both spun off the track and were unable to continue. Boullion blamed his spin on <a href="Minardi">Minardi</a> driver <a href="Pedro%20Lamy">Pedro Lamy</a>, whom he accused of weaving in front of him. Schumacher passed Berger for fourth position on lap five, and immediately began closing on Hill in third, who himself was only a few tenths behind Alesi. Schumacher attempted to pass Hill on lap 11 for third place at the <a href="Hairpin%20bend%23Motorsports">hairpin</a>, but Hill held him off. As Hill and Schumacher were held up by the slower Ferrari cars, Coulthard pulled away by more than a second a lap in the first eight laps. By lap 18, Coulthard's gap to second place was 14 seconds, and it appeared that he would win the race comfortably.

Alesi, Hill and Schumacher all made pit stops for their first of three stops on lap 18. The Benetton <a href="Pit%20stop%23F1%20pit%20crew%20roles">pitcrew</a> made a quick stop for Schumacher, allowing him to get out ahead of Alesi and Hill. Hill lost additional time with a sticking refuelling valve, causing his stop to last almost twice as long as Schumacher's. Schumacher exited the pit stop in fourth place (behind Coulthard, and the yet-to-stop Berger and Herbert), with Alesi in seventh place (split from Schumacher by Irvine) and Hill in tenth place (separated from Alesi by Frentzen and Blundell). With Alesi and Hill held up by the slower runners on two-stop strategies in front, Schumacher pulled away and closed in on Coulthard. Blundell made a pit stop on the next lap, and Hill passed Frentzen on lap 22. On the following lap, Alesi passed Irvine at the hairpin; Hill tried to follow Alesi through but his <a href="Downforce%23Front">front wing</a> hit the rear of Irvine's car, causing minor damage. Irvine made a pit stop at the end of lap 25, allowing Hill to resume his chase of Alesi unimpeded. Like his teammate, Coulthard was scheduled to make three stops, but his <a href="Pit%20stop%23General%20strategy">pit strategy</a> was changed to make only two by staying out six laps longer than originally scheduled, and then taking onboard more fuel than first planned at his first stop on lap 24. As a result of a lighter fuel load for Schumacher because of the different strategies, Schumacher began to consistently lap faster than the Scotsman.

Schumacher made his second stop on lap 38, and came out of the pit lane just in front of third-placed Alesi, but over twenty seconds behind Coulthard. Schumacher immediately began setting <a href="fastest%20lap">fastest lap</a>s and began to close in on Coulthard once more. Hill managed to move up to third, in front of Alesi, during their second pit stops on laps 38 and 39 respectively. The Ferrari of Alesi then dropped further back as teammate Berger passed him at the hairpin for fourth position on lap 45. Coulthard made his second and final stop for new tyres on lap 49; exiting 14 seconds behind Schumacher, who continued to extend the margin between the two. Coulthard was unable to capitalise on the performance advantage offered by the new tyres after the stop due to <a href="Racing%20flags%23Blue%20flag">lapped traffic</a> getting in his way. The German made his third and final pit stop on lap 60 with a 21-second advantage, exiting in front of Coulthard to lead the race. Schumacher opened the gap to 15 seconds, and won the race after 83 laps to secure his eighth victory of the season in a time of 1:48:49.972s. Schumacher was crowned the 1995 Drivers' Champion as Hill could not catch his points total with two races remaining. He also became the <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20driver%20records%23Other%20driver%20records">youngest double Drivers' Champion</a> in Formula One history. Coulthard finished second in his Williams, 14 seconds behind Schumacher, with teammate Hill third. The Ferrari cars of Berger and Alesi were fourth and fifth respectively, but off the pace as Schumacher lapped them both in the closing stages. Berger suffered from a misfiring engine throughout the race. Herbert took the final point in sixth place for Benetton, ahead of Frentzen, Panis and Blundell. Throughout the race, Barrichello and Magnussen engaged in a battle for tenth and eleventh positions, with Magnussen keeping Barrichello behind until lap 37 when the Brazilian managed to overtake him into the hairpin. Magnussen finished in tenth place, but Barrichello subsequently retired on lap 67 with an engine problem. Magnussen's first race was described as "highly accomplished" by the year's "<a href="Autocourse">Autocourse</a>" annual. After his impressive qualifying performance, Irvine was heading for eighth place, but made an unscheduled pit stop on lap 72 and dropped to eleventh. The attrition rate was low, with 17 of the 24 starters finishing the race.

After the race, it was revealed that Schumacher endured a <a href="Transmission%20%28mechanics%29">downshift</a> problem after his final stop, and that he was lucky to complete the final lap as warning lights had activated on his steering wheel. Schumacher praised his pitcrew for doing a "perfect" first stop which helped him move in front of Alesi and Hill. He said he "never saw anything like this team and its ability to come up with strategies" and that they never made "one mistake this season". Off-camera while going through <a href="parc%20ferm%C3%A9">parc fermé</a>, Schumacher and Hill renewed their argument from the <a href="1995%20Belgian%20Grand%20Prix">Belgian Grand Prix</a> over what degree of blocking was acceptable after their first corner incident. Schumacher told Hill that he was unhappy with Hill's driving throughout the race, most notably during Schumacher's overtaking attempts on lap one and lap eleven where Schumacher felt Hill had "brake tested" him. Hill refuted Schumacher's claims, saying:

Despite Hill's comments, he endured continued criticism by the British media after the poor performance; speculation brewed that Williams were going to replace him with Frentzen for the 1996 season. Despite the rumours, Williams team boss <a href="Frank%20Williams%20%28Formula%20One%29">Frank Williams</a> gave Hill "an unequivocal vote of confidence" heading into the next race, the <a href="1995%20Japanese%20Grand%20Prix">Japanese Grand Prix</a>. Schumacher subsequently changed his opinion of the incident after watching video footage prior to the Japanese race and no longer blamed Hill for it.

During an interview Coulthard, who finished second, revealed that it was his decision to change to a two-stop strategy from a three-stop strategy, telling the Williams pitcrew to delay his stop. Afterwards, he said that in hindsight he would have stayed on a three-stop strategy, and wished he could "blame someone else for this decision, but I can't". The 1995 race was the last held at the Aida circuit, and the last Formula One race to date held under the Pacific Grand Prix banner, with the manager of the <a href="Okayama%20International%20Circuit">TI Circuit</a> unable to keep the venue financially profitable.

1995 Japanese Grand Prix

The 1995 Japanese Grand Prix (formally the XXI Fuji Television Japanese Grand Prix) was a <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> motor race held on 29 October 1995, at the <a href="Suzuka%20Circuit">Suzuka Circuit</a>, <a href="Suzuka%2C%20Mie">Suzuka</a>. It was the sixteenth and penultimate round of the <a href="1995%20Formula%20One%20season">1995 Formula One season</a>. The 53-lap race was won by <a href="Michael%20Schumacher">Michael Schumacher</a> for the <a href="Benetton%20Formula">Benetton</a> team after he started from <a href="pole%20position">pole position</a>. <a href="Mika%20H%C3%A4kkinen">Mika Häkkinen</a> finished second in a <a href="McLaren%20%28racing%29">McLaren</a>, and <a href="Johnny%20Herbert">Johnny Herbert</a> third in the other Benetton car.

<a href="Jean%20Alesi">Jean Alesi</a>, driving for <a href="Scuderia%20Ferrari">Ferrari</a>, started second, alongside Schumacher. However, Alesi was forced to serve a <a href="Formula%20One%20regulations%23Penalties">10-second stop-and-go penalty</a> because his car moved forward before the start. Alesi climbed back up to second, before retiring on lap 25. Schumacher's rival in the <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Drivers%27%20Champions">Drivers' Championship</a>, <a href="Damon%20Hill">Damon Hill</a>, started fourth amidst pressure from the British media after poor performances at previous races. Hill moved up to second because of Alesi's retirement, but spun off the track on lap 40.

Schumacher's win was his ninth of the season, matching the <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20driver%20records%23Most%20wins%20in%20a%20season">record</a> set in by <a href="Nigel%20Mansell">Nigel Mansell</a>. Benetton was confirmed <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Constructors%27%20Champions">Constructors' Champions</a> as <a href="Williams%20F1">Williams</a> could not pass its points total in the one remaining race.

Heading into the penultimate race of the season, <a href="Benetton%20Formula">Benetton</a> driver <a href="Michael%20Schumacher">Michael Schumacher</a> had already won the season's <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Drivers%27%20Champions">Drivers' Championship</a>, having clinched the title at the previous race, the <a href="1995%20Pacific%20Grand%20Prix">Pacific Grand Prix</a>. Schumacher led the championship with 92 points; <a href="Damon%20Hill">Damon Hill</a> was second with 59 points. A maximum of 20 points were available for the remaining two races, which meant that Hill could not catch Schumacher. Although the Drivers' Championship was decided, the <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Constructors%27%20Champions">Constructors' Championship</a> was not. Benetton were leading on 123 points and <a href="WilliamsF1">Williams</a> were second with 102 points heading into the 16th race, with a maximum of 32 points available. In the week leading up to the race, Hill was criticised by the British media after poor performances in previous races; there was continued speculation that Williams were going to replace him with <a href="Heinz-Harald%20Frentzen">Heinz-Harald Frentzen</a> or <a href="Gerhard%20Berger">Gerhard Berger</a> for the <a href="1996%20Formula%20One%20season">1996 season</a>. Despite the rumours, Williams team boss <a href="Frank%20Williams%20%28Formula%20One%29">Frank Williams</a> gave Hill "an unequivocal vote of confidence" heading into the race.
There were two driver changes heading into the race. Having been in one of the two <a href="Sauber">Sauber</a> cars since the fifth race of the season at <a href="1995%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">Monaco</a>, <a href="Jean-Christophe%20Boullion">Jean-Christophe Boullion</a> was released from the team and replaced by <a href="Karl%20Wendlinger">Karl Wendlinger</a>. The Austrian was given another chance to prove himself after suffering an accident at the <a href="1994%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">1994 Monaco Grand Prix</a>, which left him in a coma for weeks. The second driver change was <a href="Mika%20H%C3%A4kkinen">Mika Häkkinen</a>'s return to <a href="McLaren%20%28racing%29">McLaren</a> after missing the Pacific Grand Prix because of an operation for <a href="appendicitis">appendicitis</a>.

Two practice sessions were held before the race; the first was held on Friday morning and the second on Saturday morning. Both sessions lasted 1 hour and 45 minutes with weather conditions dry throughout. Schumacher was fastest in the first session, posting a time of 1:40.410, two-tenths of a second quicker than Häkkinen. The Williams and <a href="Scuderia%20Ferrari">Ferrari</a> cars occupied the remaining top six positions; Williams drivers Hill and <a href="David%20Coulthard">David Coulthard</a> third and fifth respectively. The Ferrari cars were fourth and sixth fastest; <a href="Jean%20Alesi">Jean Alesi</a> ahead of Berger. Häkkinen lapped faster than Schumacher in the second practice session with a time of 1:40.389. <a href="Eddie%20Irvine">Eddie Irvine</a> took second place in the <a href="Jordan%20Grand%20Prix">Jordan</a> car, three-tenths of a second behind Häkkinen. Hill was third in the Williams, two-tenths behind Häkkinen, with Schumacher fourth behind Hill. The Ferrari cars were fifth and eighth; Alesi in front of Berger. Frentzen's Sauber and Coulthard's Williams split the Ferrari drivers. Despite both the Williams cars going off into the <a href="Run-off%20area">gravel</a>, Hill and Coulthard made the top 10.

The <a href="List%20of%20motorsport%20terminology%23Q">qualifying session</a> was split into two one-hour sessions; the first was held on Friday afternoon with the second held on Saturday afternoon. The fastest time from either sessions counted towards their final <a href="Standing%20start">grid position</a>. Schumacher clinched his tenth career <a href="pole%20position">pole position</a>, in his <a href="Benetton%20B195">Benetton B195</a>, with a time of 1:38.023. He was joined on the front row by Alesi, who was eight-tenths of a second behind. Schumacher was particularly pleased with the performance of his Benetton, saying that "I have rarely had such a good car ... I think I can be confident for the race". Alesi was satisfied about his performance, but worried about a mechanical problem which had caused him to crash on Friday, accusing the Ferrari team of withholding information from him. Alesi was scheduled to leave Ferrari for Benetton in a swap with Schumacher at the end of the season, and the relationship between him and the team was becoming increasingly strained. Häkkinen was third in the McLaren, with Hill fourth, a second slower than Schumacher. Despite Häkkinen's best qualifying effort of the season alongside his <a href="1995%20Belgian%20Grand%20Prix">Belgium</a> third place, his teammate, <a href="Mark%20Blundell">Mark Blundell</a>, had a disappointing qualifying session. In the first part of qualifying, Blundell crashed into the wall, meaning he could not set a time as his car was too badly damaged. Blundell had his second crash of the weekend at the 130R corner in Saturday practice, which was more serious than the first. Following medical advice, Blundell did not participate in the second qualifying session. He was unable to set a time, leaving him at the back of the grid. <a href="Aguri%20Suzuki">Aguri Suzuki</a> crashed his <a href="Equipe%20Ligier">Ligier</a> during Saturday qualifying; he was unable to start the race since he was in a hospital with a broken rib.

The track surface was damp for most of the race, which meant that lap times were slower than the previous days' qualifying sessions. The drivers took to the track at 09:30 <a href="Japan%20Standard%20Time">JST</a> (<a href="Greenwich%20Mean%20Time">GMT</a> +9) for a 30-minute warmup session. Despite underperforming in qualifying, both Williams cars performed better in the wet weather warmup session; Hill had the fastest time of 2:00.025. Coulthard was third in the other Williams car; Schumacher split them in second position. Alesi completed the top four, eight-tenths of a second behind Hill. Though 24 cars qualified for the race, only 22 took the start: Suzuki was unable to start because of his crash in qualifying and <a href="Roberto%20Moreno">Roberto Moreno</a>'s <a href="Forti">Forti</a> car suffered a gearbox problem. For the first time since the Japanese Grand Prix was held at Suzuka in <a href="1987%20Japanese%20Grand%20Prix">1987</a>, tickets for the race did not sell out, despite the fact that three Japanese drivers entered the race.

The race started at 14:00 JST. All of the drivers opted to start on <a href="Rain%20tyre">wet weather tyres</a> as the track was damp from the morning rain. Schumacher, from pole position on the grid, held onto the lead into the first corner. Alesi, who started alongside Schumacher, was judged to have jumped the start, and served a <a href="Formula%20One%20regulations%23Penalties">10-second stop-and-go penalty</a> on lap three, from which he returned to the race in tenth place. Alesi's teammate Berger also jumped the start and received the same penalty. <a href="Gianni%20Morbidelli">Gianni Morbidelli</a>, near the back of the field in one of the <a href="Footwork%20Arrows">Footwork</a> cars, spun at the first corner on lap one after being hit from behind by Wendlinger's Sauber. Morbidelli <a href="Stall%20%28engine%29">stalled</a> his car in the process, forcing him to retire from the race. On lap seven, Alesi stopped at the <a href="pit%20stop">pits</a> to change to dry weather <a href="Slick%20tire">slick tyres</a>, as the track was beginning to dry. On returning to the race, he began to make his way through the field constantly recording fastest laps; the first of which was 1:54.416, five seconds faster than the remainder of the field. Schumacher made a pit stop on lap 10 for slicks, handing the lead to Häkkinen for a lap before he too pitted. Alesi's progress was interrupted when he spun attempting to pass <a href="Pedro%20Lamy">Pedro Lamy</a>'s <a href="Minardi">Minardi</a> for 15th place, but he made his way up to second by lap 10, overtaking Hill around the outside in the final <a href="chicane">chicane</a> to take the place. Alerted by Alesi's pace on the slick tyres, the other drivers came into the pits to change to slick tyres.
The two Jordan cars collided on lap 15. <a href="Rubens%20Barrichello">Rubens Barrichello</a> spun in the final chicane when he attempted to brake later than his teammate Irvine. Barrichello hit a wall, which damaged his car's rear wing and caused him to retire from the race. Irvine was involved in another collision at the chicane on lap 20 when Frentzen hit him from behind. Irvine continued without damage, but Frentzen had to pit for a new front wing. At the front, Alesi was lapping faster than Schumacher, even though Schumacher was on dry tyres. Alesi was only six seconds behind Schumacher when his <a href="Ferrari%20412%20T2">Ferrari 412T2</a> suffered an apparent <a href="Differential%20%28mechanical%20device%29">differential</a> failure on lap 25. It was later discovered that the problem was a <a href="driveshaft">driveshaft</a> failure, possibly as a result of his earlier spin. Schumacher made a pit stop for a second time on lap 31, returning to the race in second place behind Hill. Schumacher set the fastest lap of the race on lap 33, and regained his lead on the next lap when Hill made his pit stop. Behind them, Häkkinen and Coulthard were third and fourth respectively before their pit stops, but Coulthard pitted six laps later than Häkkinen and returned to the track in third place, one place ahead of the Finn. <a href="Johnny%20Herbert">Johnny Herbert</a> was fifth in the second Benetton car after the second round of pit stops, with Irvine rounding out the point-scoring places in sixth.

At this stage, the rain began to fall again, but only at the Spoon Curve end of the track. The Williams drivers were second and third until Hill ran off the track at Spoon Curve two laps after his pit stop. He damaged his front wing in the process and returned to the track in fourth. Hill returned to the pits to let his pit crew replace the damaged wing. He rejoined fifth, but was then given a ten-second stop-and-go penalty for speeding in the pitlane. Coulthard made the same mistake as his teammate by running through the gravel trap at the Spoon Curve but looked like he was going to escape with only minor damage. However, as he braked for 130R, the next corner, the gravel which had entered his <a href="Ground%20effect%20in%20cars">sidepods</a> flew out, causing him to lose control and get his car stuck in the gravel trap. Hill was told by his team on the radio to speed up as he had not yet taken his stop-and-go penalty, but later that lap he spun off at Spoon Curve and retired from the race without having taken the penalty. Blundell, Irvine and Frentzen also left the track at Spoon Curve but all finished the race. With his closest challenger out, Schumacher won the race after 53 laps to secure his ninth victory of the season in a time of 1:36:52.930. The win, along with Herbert's third place and the retirements of Hill and Coulthard, gave Benetton the 1995 Constructors' Championship. Häkkinen finished second in his McLaren, 20 seconds behind Schumacher. Irvine was fourth in his Jordan with <a href="Olivier%20Panis">Olivier Panis</a> fifth in his Ligier. <a href="Mika%20Salo">Mika Salo</a> took sixth place and the final point in his <a href="Tyrrell%20Racing">Tyrrell</a>. Despite starting last, Blundell finished in seventh, just 1.6 seconds behind Salo. The delayed Frentzen, <a href="Luca%20Badoer">Luca Badoer</a>, Wendlinger, Lamy and <a href="Taki%20Inoue">Taki Inoue</a> completed the finishers.

This was Schumacher's last win for Benetton, as he moved to the Ferrari team for the <a href="1996%20Formula%20One%20season">1996 season</a>. Herbert reiterated Schumacher's opinion by stating that Benetton did "a fantastic job". Hill was disappointed about the race and the season as a whole; he said afterwards:

As a result of Hill not taking his 10-second stop-and-go penalty because of his retirement, Williams were fined <a href="United%20States%20dollar">$</a>10,000 by Formula One's <a href="Sport%20governing%20body">governing body</a>, the <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Internationale%20de%20l%27Automobile">Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile</a> (FIA). In an interview with "<a href="Motor%20Sport%20%28magazine%29">Motor Sport</a>" magazine in 2008, Hill said that the 1995 season, as a whole, "went down, mentally, and it all just got to me". He also said he believed that it was in 1995 that Frank Williams and <a href="Patrick%20Head">Patrick Head</a> decided to replace him for the 1997 season.

<a href="1980%20Formula%20One%20season">1980 Formula One World Champion</a> <a href="Alan%20Jones%20%28Formula%201%29">Alan Jones</a> praised Alesi's performance, saying that it "will go down as one of the great drives in Grand Prix racing". Alesi stated that if his driveshaft had not failed, he would "have fought for it, all the way to the end". Alesi added that he believed he did not jump the start, but admitted that "the car crept forwards by a few centimetres" because of the downhill slope of the grid. In an interview with "<a href="Autosport">Autosport</a>" magazine in 2009, Alesi said that he went to see the race director before the race to see how he could avoid a penalty at the downhill start and that he was "totally fed up" with the penalty decision given. Berger also questioned his penalty, claiming that his car did not move before the green light went on.

Joseph Barbera

Joseph Roland Barbera ( ; ; March 24, 1911 – December 18, 2006) was an American <a href="animator">animator</a>, <a href="Film%20director">director</a>, <a href="Film%20producer">producer</a>, <a href="storyboard%20artist">storyboard artist</a>, and <a href="cartoonist">cartoon artist</a>, whose film and television cartoon characters entertained millions of fans worldwide for much of the 20th century.

He was born to <a href="Italian%20Americans">Italian immigrants</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, where he lived, attended college, and began his career through his young adult years. After working odd jobs and as a banker, Barbera joined <a href="Van%20Beuren%20Studios">Van Beuren Studios</a> in 1932 and subsequently <a href="Terrytoons">Terrytoons</a> in 1936. In 1937, he moved to California and while working at <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> (MGM), Barbera met <a href="William%20Hanna">William Hanna</a>. The two men began a collaboration that was at first best known for producing "<a href="Tom%20and%20Jerry">Tom and Jerry</a>". In 1957, after MGM dissolved their animation department, they co-founded <a href="Hanna-Barbera">Hanna-Barbera</a>, which became the most successful television animation studio in the business, producing programs such as "<a href="The%20Flintstones">The Flintstones</a>", "<a href="The%20Yogi%20Bear%20Show">Yogi Bear</a>", "<a href="Scooby-Doo%2C%20Where%20Are%20You%3F">Scooby-Doo</a>", "<a href="Top%20Cat">Top Cat</a>", "<a href="The%20Smurfs%20%28TV%20series%29">The Smurfs</a>", "<a href="The%20Huckleberry%20Hound%20Show">Huckleberry Hound</a>" and "<a href="The%20Jetsons">The Jetsons</a>". In 1967, Hanna-Barbera was sold to <a href="Taft%20Broadcasting">Taft Broadcasting</a> for $12 million, but Hanna and Barbera remained heads of the company until 1991. At that time, the studio was sold to <a href="Turner%20Broadcasting%20System">Turner Broadcasting System</a>, which in turn was merged with <a href="Time%20Warner">Time Warner</a>, owners of <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a>, in 1996; Hanna and Barbera stayed on as advisors.

Hanna and Barbera won seven <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Awards</a> and eight <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a>s. Their cartoon shows have become cultural icons, and their cartoon characters have appeared in other media such as films, books, and toys. Hanna-Barbera's shows had a worldwide audience of over 300 million people in the 1960s and have been translated into more than 20 languages.

Joseph Barbera was born at 10 <a href="Delancey%20Street">Delancey Street</a> in the <a href="Little%20Italy%2C%20Manhattan">Little Italy</a> (<a href="Lower%20East%20Side">Lower East Side</a>) section of <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, New York, to immigrants Vincent Barbera (of Italian origin) and Francesca Calvacca Barbera, born in <a href="Sciacca">Sciacca (Italy)</a>, and he grew up speaking Italian. His family moved to <a href="Flatbush%2C%20Brooklyn">Flatbush, Brooklyn</a>, New York when he was four months old. He had two younger brothers, Larry and Ted, both of whom served in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. As a member of the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a>, Larry participated in the <a href="Operation%20Husky">invasion of Sicily</a>. Ted was a fighter pilot with the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> and served in the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands%20Campaign">Aleutian Islands Campaign</a>. Barbera's father, Vincent, was the prosperous owner of three <a href="barber">barber</a>shops who squandered the family fortunes on gambling. By the time Barbera was 15, his father had abandoned the family and his maternal uncle Jim became a father figure to him.

Barbera displayed a talent for drawing as early as the first grade. He graduated from <a href="Erasmus%20Hall%20High%20School">Erasmus Hall High School</a> in Brooklyn in 1928. While in high school, Barbera won several <a href="boxing">boxing</a> titles. He was briefly managed by World Lightweight Boxing Champion <a href="Al%20Singer">Al Singer</a>'s manager but soon lost interest in boxing. In 1935, Barbera married his high school sweetheart, Dorothy Earl. In school, they had been known as "Romeo and Juliet".

Barbera and his wife briefly separated when he went to <a href="California">California</a>. They reunited but were on the verge of another separation when they discovered that Dorothy was pregnant with their first child. They had four children: two sons (Neal and an infant boy who died two days after his birth) and two daughters (Lynn and Jayne, who has been a producer in her own right). The marriage officially ended in 1963. Shortly after his divorce, Barbera met his second wife, Sheila Holden, sister of British rock and roll singer <a href="Vince%20Taylor">Vince Taylor</a> at Musso & Frank's restaurant, where she worked as <a href="bookkeeper">bookkeeper</a> and cashier. Unlike Dorothy, who had preferred to stay at home with the children, Sheila enjoyed the <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> social scene that Barbera often frequented.

During high school, Barbera worked as a tailor's delivery boy. In 1929, he became interested in animation after watching a screening of "<a href="The%20Skeleton%20Dance">The Skeleton Dance</a>". During the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, he tried unsuccessfully to become a cartoonist for a magazine called "The NY Hits Magazine". He supported himself with a job at a bank, and continued to pursue publication for his cartoons. His magazine drawings of single cartoons, not comic strips, began to be published in "<a href="Redbook">Redbook</a>", "<a href="Saturday%20Evening%20Post">Saturday Evening Post</a>", and "<a href="Collier%27s">Collier's</a>"—the magazine with which he had the most success. Barbera also wrote to <a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a> for advice on getting started in the <a href="animation">animation</a> industry. Disney wrote back, saying he would call Barbera during an upcoming trip to New York, but the call never took place.

Barbera took art classes at the <a href="Art%20Students%20League%20of%20New%20York">Art Students League of New York</a> and the <a href="Pratt%20Institute">Pratt Institute</a> and was hired to work in the <a href="Traditional%20animation%23Traditional%20ink-and-paint%20and%20camera">ink and paint</a> department of <a href="Fleischer%20Studios">Fleischer Studios</a>. In 1932, he joined the Van Beuren Studios as an animator and <a href="storyboard">storyboard</a> artist. He worked on cartoon series such as "Cubby Bear" and "Rainbow Parades", and an earlier "<a href="Tom%20and%20Jerry%20%28Van%20Beuren%29">Tom and Jerry</a>". This "Tom and Jerry" series starred two humans; it was unrelated to Barbera's later cat-and-mouse series. When Van Beuren closed down in 1936, Barbera moved over to <a href="Paul%20Terry%20%28cartoonist%29">Paul Terry</a>'s Terrytoons studio.

In 1935, Barbera created his first solo-effort storyboard about a character named "Kiko the Kangaroo". The storyline was of Kiko in an airplane race with another character called "Dirty Dog". Terry declined to produce the story. In his autobiography, Barbera said of his efforts ..."I was, quite honestly, not in the least disappointed. I had proven to myself that I could do a storyboard, and that I had gained the experience of presenting it. For now, that was enough."The original storyboard, which had been passed down through the Barbera family, went on sale at auction in November 2013.

Lured by a substantial salary increase, Barbera left Terrytoons and New York for the new Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) cartoon unit in California in 1937. He found that Los Angeles was suffering just as much from the Great Depression as Brooklyn and almost returned to Brooklyn.

Barbera's desk was opposite that of <a href="William%20Hanna">William Hanna</a>. The two quickly realized they would make a good team. By 1939, they had solidified a partnership that would last over 60 years. Barbera and Hanna worked alongside animator <a href="Tex%20Avery">Tex Avery</a>, who had created <a href="Daffy%20Duck">Daffy Duck</a> and <a href="Bugs%20Bunny">Bugs Bunny</a> for <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Cartoons">Warner Bros.</a> and directed "<a href="Droopy">Droopy</a>" cartoons at MGM.

In 1940, Hanna and Barbera jointly directed "<a href="Puss%20Gets%20the%20Boot">Puss Gets the Boot</a>", which was nominated for an <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Animated%20Short%20Film">Academy Award for Best (Cartoon) Short Subject</a>. The studio wanted a diversified cartoon portfolio, so despite the success of "Puss Gets the Boot", Barbera and Hanna's supervisor, <a href="Fred%20Quimby">Fred Quimby</a>, did not want to produce more cat and mouse cartoons believing that there were already enough cartoons of those in existence. Surprised by the success of "Puss Gets the Boot", Barbera and Hanna ignored Quimby's resistance and continued developing the cat-and-mouse theme. By this time, however, Hanna wanted to return to working for Ising, to whom he felt very loyal. Barbera and Hanna met with Quimby, who discovered that although Ising had taken sole credit for producing "Puss Gets the Boot", he never actually worked on it. Quimby then gave Hanna and Barbera permission to pursue their cat-and-mouse idea. The result was their most famous creation, "Tom and Jerry".

Modeled after the "Puss Gets the Boot" characters with slight differences, the series followed Jerry, the pesky rodent who continuously outwitted his feline foe, Tom. Hanna said they settled on the cat and mouse theme for this cartoon because "we knew we needed two characters. We thought we needed conflict, and chase and action. And a cat after a mouse seemed like a good, basic thought." The revamped characters first appeared in 1941's "<a href="The%20Midnight%20Snack">The Midnight Snack</a>". Over the next 17 years, Barbera and Hanna worked exclusively on "Tom and Jerry", directing more than 114 popular cartoon shorts. During World War II, they also made animated training films. "Tom and Jerry" relied mostly on motion instead of dialog. Despite its popularity, "Tom and Jerry" has often been criticized as excessively violent. Nonetheless, the series won its first Academy Award for the 11th short, "<a href="The%20Yankee%20Doodle%20Mouse">The Yankee Doodle Mouse</a>" (1943)—a war-time adventure. "Tom and Jerry" was ultimately nominated for 14 Academy Awards, winning 7. No other character-based theatrical animated series has won more awards, nor has any other series featuring the same characters. Tom and Jerry also made guest appearances in several of MGM's live-action films, including "<a href="Anchors%20Aweigh%20%28film%29">Anchors Aweigh</a>" (1945) and "<a href="Invitation%20to%20the%20Dance%20%28film%29">Invitation to the Dance</a>" (1956) with <a href="Gene%20Kelly">Gene Kelly</a>, and "<a href="Dangerous%20When%20Wet">Dangerous When Wet</a>" (1953) with <a href="Esther%20Williams">Esther Williams</a>.

In addition to his work in animated cartoons, Barbera and "Tom and Jerry" layout artist <a href="Harvey%20Eisenberg">Harvey Eisenberg</a> moonlit to run a comic book company named Dearfield Publishing. Active from 1946 to 1951, Dearfield's titles included ""Red" Rabbit Comics", "Foxy Fagan", and "Junie Prom".

Quimby accepted each Academy Award for "Tom and Jerry" without inviting Barbera and Hanna onstage. The cartoons were also released with Quimby listed as the sole producer, following the same practice for which he had condemned Ising. Quimby once delayed a promised raise to Barbera by six months . When Quimby retired in late 1955, Hanna and Barbera were placed in charge of MGM's animation division. As MGM began to lose more revenue on animated cartoons due to television, the studio soon realized that re-releasing old cartoons was far more profitable than producing new ones. In 1957, MGM ordered Barbera and Hanna's business manager to close the cartoon division and lay off everyone by a phone call. Barbera and Hanna found the no-notice closing puzzling because "Tom and Jerry" had been so successful.

Barbera's first foray into television was a 1957 collaboration with <a href="Robert%20D.%20Buchanan">Robert D. Buchanan</a>, "<a href="Colonel%20Bleep">Colonel Bleep</a>". The series, the first ever cartoon produced specifically for color television, would feature some of the futuristic designs and limited animation Barbera would later carry over to his other television productions. Barbera's involvement in "Colonel Bleep" (and with Buchanan) was apparently short-lived; his only known credited involvement was a creator credit.

In 1957, Barbera reteamed with his former partner Hanna to produce cartoon films for television and theatrical release. As they had at MGM, the two brought their different skills to the company; Barbera was a skilled gag writer and sketch artist, while Hanna had a gift for timing, story construction, and recruiting top artists. Major business decisions would be made together, though each year the title of president alternated between them. A <a href="Coin%20flipping">coin toss</a> determined that Hanna would have precedence in the naming of the new company, first called H-B Enterprises but soon changed to <a href="Hanna-Barbera">Hanna-Barbera Productions</a>. Barbera and Hanna's MGM colleague <a href="George%20Sidney">George Sidney</a>, the director of "Anchors Aweigh", became the third partner and business manager in the company, and arranged a deal for distribution and working capital with <a href="Screen%20Gems">Screen Gems</a>, the television division of <a href="Columbia%20Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a>, who took part ownership of the new studio.

The first offering from the new company was "<a href="The%20Ruff%20%26amp%3B%20Reddy%20Show">The Ruff & Reddy Show</a>", a series which detailed the friendship between a dog and cat. Despite a lukewarm response for their first theatrical venture, "<a href="Loopy%20De%20Loop">Loopy De Loop</a>", Hanna-Barbera soon established themselves with two successful television series: "<a href="The%20Huckleberry%20Hound%20Show">The Huckleberry Hound Show</a>" and "<a href="The%20Yogi%20Bear%20Show">The Yogi Bear Show</a>". A 1960 survey showed that half of the viewers of "Huckleberry Hound" were adults. This prompted the company to create a new animated series, "The Flintstones". A parody of "<a href="The%20Honeymooners">The Honeymooners</a>", the new show followed a typical <a href="Stone%20Age">Stone Age</a> family with home appliances, talking animals, and celebrity guests. With an audience of both children and adults, "The Flintstones" became the first animated prime-time show to be a hit. <a href="Fred%20Flintstone">Fred Flintstone</a>'s signature exclamation ""yabba dabba doo"" soon entered everyday usage, and the show boosted the studio to the top of the TV cartoon field. The company later produced a futuristic version of "The Flintstones", known as "The Jetsons". Although both shows reappeared in the 1970s and 1980s, "The Flintstones" was far more popular.

By the late 1960s, Hanna-Barbera Productions was the most successful television animation studio in the business. The Hanna-Barbera studio produced over 3000 animated half-hour television shows. Among the more than 100 cartoon series they produced were "<a href="The%20Quick%20Draw%20McGraw%20Show">The Quick Draw McGraw Show</a>", "<a href="Top%20Cat">Top Cat</a>", "<a href="Jonny%20Quest%20%28TV%20series%29">Jonny Quest</a>", "<a href="The%20Magilla%20Gorilla%20Show">The Magilla Gorilla Show</a>", "<a href="The%20Atom%20Ant/Secret%20Squirrel%20Show">The Atom Ant/Secret Squirrel Show</a>", "<a href="Scooby-Doo">Scooby-Doo</a>", "<a href="Super%20Friends">Super Friends</a>", and "<a href="The%20Smurfs%20%28TV%20series%29">The Smurfs</a>". The company also produced animated specials based on "<a href="Alice%20in%20Wonderland%20%28or%20What%27s%20a%20Nice%20Kid%20Like%20You%20Doing%20in%20a%20Place%20Like%20This%3F%29">Alice in Wonderland</a>", "<a href="Jack%20and%20the%20Beanstalk">Jack and the Beanstalk</a>", and "<a href="Cyrano%20de%20Bergerac%20%28play%29">Cyrano de Bergerac</a>", as well as the feature-length films "<a href="Charlotte%27s%20Web%20%281973%20film%29">Charlotte's Web</a>" and "<a href="Heidi%27s%20Song">Heidi's Song</a>".

As popular as their cartoons were with 1960s audiences, they were disliked by artists. Television programs had lower budgets than theatrical animation, and this economic reality caused many animation studios to go out of business in the 1950s and 1960s, putting many people in the industry out of work. Hanna-Barbera was key in the development of an animation technique known as <a href="limited%20animation">limited animation</a>, which allowed television animation to be more cost-effective, but often reduced quality. Hanna and Barbera had first experimented with these techniques in the early days of "Tom and Jerry". To reduce the cost of each episode, shows often focused more on character dialogue than detailed animation. The number of drawings for a seven-minute cartoon decreased from 14,000 to nearly 2,000, and the company implemented innovative techniques such as rapid background changes to improve viewing. Critics criticized the change from detailed animation to repetitive movements by two-dimensional characters. Barbera once said that their choice was to adapt to the television budgets or change careers. The new style did not limit the success of their animated shows, enabling Hanna-Barbera to stay in business, providing employment to many who would otherwise have been out of work. Limited animation paved the way for future animated series such as "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>", "<a href="SpongeBob%20SquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a>", and "<a href="South%20Park">South Park</a>".

In December 1966, Hanna-Barbera Productions was sold to Taft Broadcasting (renamed Great American Communications in 1987) for $12 million. Barbera and Hanna remained at the head of the company until 1991. At that point, the company was sold to the Turner Broadcasting System for an estimated $320 million. Turner began using Hanna-Barbera's television catalog as material for its new <a href="Cartoon%20Network">Cartoon Network</a> cable channel in 1992, and by the mid-1990s Hanna-Barbera was producing several original series for Cartoon Network, among them "<a href="Dexter%27s%20Laboratory">Dexter's Laboratory</a>" and "<a href="The%20Powerpuff%20Girls">The Powerpuff Girls</a>". In 1996, Turner merged with Time Warner, owners of Warner Bros., who would eventually absorb Hanna-Barbera into <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Animation">Warner Bros. Animation</a>.
Barbera and Hanna continued to advise their former company and periodically worked on new Hanna-Barbera shows, including shorts for the series "<a href="The%20Cartoon%20Cartoon%20Show">The Cartoon Cartoon Show</a>" and feature film versions of "<a href="The%20Flintstones%20%28film%29">The Flintstones</a>" (1994) and "<a href="Scooby-Doo%20%28film%29">Scooby-Doo</a>" (2002). In a new "Tom and Jerry" cartoon produced in 2000, "<a href="The%20Mansion%20Cat">The Mansion Cat</a>", Barbera voiced the houseowner.

After Hanna's death from throat cancer in March 2001, Hanna-Barbera was absorbed into <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Animation">Warner Bros. Animation</a>, with the unit dedicated to the Cartoon Network original series spun off into <a href="Cartoon%20Network%20Studios">Cartoon Network Studios</a>. Barbera remained active as an executive producer for Warner Bros. on direct-to-video cartoon features as well as television series such as "<a href="What%27s%20New%2C%20Scooby-Doo%3F">What's New, Scooby-Doo?</a>" and "<a href="Tom%20and%20Jerry%20Tales">Tom and Jerry Tales</a>". He also wrote, co-storyboarded, co-directed and co-produced "<a href="The%20Karate%20Guard">The Karate Guard</a>" (2005), the return of "Tom and Jerry" to the big screen. His final animated project was the direct-to-video feature "" (2007).

Barbera died at age 95 at his home in <a href="Studio%20City%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Studio City, Los Angeles</a> on December 18, 2006 of natural causes, ending a 70-year career in animation. His wife Sheila was at his side. He was buried in a private section of the Great Mausoleum in <a href="Glendale%2C%20California">Glendale's</a> <a href="Forest%20Lawn%20Memorial%20Park%2C%20Glendale">Forest Lawn Memorial Park</a> on January 1, 2007.

Most of the cartoons Barbera and Hanna created revolved around close friendship or partnership; this theme is evident with Fred and Barney, Wilma Flintstone and Betty Rubble, Dick Dastardly and Muttley, Tom and Jerry, Scooby and Shaggy, Jake Clawson/Razor and Chance Furlong/T-Bone, The Jetson family and Yogi & Boo-Boo. These may have been a reflection of the close business friendship and partnership that Barbera and Hanna shared for over 60 years. Professionally, they balanced each other's strengths and weaknesses very well, but Barbera and Hanna travelled in completely different social circles. Hanna's circle of personal friends primarily included other animators; Barbera socialized with Hollywood celebrities—<a href="Zsa%20Zsa%20Gabor">Zsa Zsa Gabor</a> was a frequent visitor to his house. Their division of work roles complemented each other but they rarely talked outside of work since Hanna was interested in the outdoors and Barbera liked beaches and good food and drink. Nevertheless, in their long partnership, in which they worked with over 2000 animated characters, Barbera and Hanna rarely exchanged a cross word. Barbera said: "We understood each other perfectly, and each of us had deep respect for the other's work." Hanna once said that Barbera could "capture mood and expression in a quick sketch better than anyone I've ever known."

Barbera and Hanna were also among the first animators to realize the enormous potential of television. <a href="Leonard%20Maltin">Leonard Maltin</a> says the Hanna–Barbera team "held a record for producing consistently superior cartoons using the same characters year after year—without a break or change in routine their characters are not only animated superstars, but also a very beloved part of American pop culture". They are often considered Walt Disney's only rivals in cartoon animation.

Barbera and Hanna had a lasting impact on television animation. Cartoons they created often make "greatest" lists. Many of their characters have appeared in film, books, toys, and other media. Their shows had a worldwide audience of over 300 million people in the 1960s and have been translated into more than 20 languages. The works of Barbera and Hanna have been praised not only for their animation, but for their music. "<a href="The%20Cat%20Concerto">The Cat Concerto</a>" (1946) and "<a href="Johann%20Mouse">Johann Mouse</a>" (1952) have both been called "masterpieces of animation" largely because of their classical music.

In all, the Hanna–Barbera team won seven Academy Awards and eight Emmy Awards, including the 1960 award for "The Huckleberry Hound Show", which was the first Emmy awarded to an animated series. They also won these awards: Golden Globe for Television Achievement (1960), Golden IKE Award – Pacific Pioneers in Broadcasting (1983), Pioneer Award – <a href="Broadcast%20Music%20Incorporated">Broadcast Music Incorporated</a> (1987), Iris Award – NATPE Men of the Year (1988), Licensing Industry Merchandisers' Association award for Lifetime Achievement (1988), Governors Award of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (1988), Jackie Coogan Award for Outstanding Contribution to Youth through Entertainment Youth in Film (1988), Frederic W. Ziv Award for Outstanding Achievement in Telecommunications – Broadcasting Division College – Conservatory of Music <a href="University%20of%20Cincinnati">University of Cincinnati</a> (1989), stars on the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> (1976), several <a href="Annie%20Award">Annie Award</a>s, several environmental awards, and were recipients of numerous other accolades prior to their induction into the <a href="Television%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Television Hall of Fame</a> in 1994. In March 2005 the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences and Warner Bros. Animation dedicated a wall sculpture at the Television Academy's Hall of Fame Plaza in North Hollywood to Hanna and Barbera.

In 1992, Barbera met with pop musician <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>, an avid cartoon fan, in an unsuccessful attempt to arrange for him to sing in "". Barbera drew five quick sketches of "Tom and Jerry" for Jackson and autographed them. Jackson autographed a picture of himself and his niece Nicole for Barbera with the words: "To my hero of yesterday, today, and tomorrow, with many thanks for all the many cartoon friends you gave me as a child. They were all I had. – Michael"

Aaliyah (album)

Aaliyah is the self-titled third and final <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by American <a href="contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> singer <a href="Aaliyah">Aaliyah</a>. It was released on July 7, 2001, by <a href="Blackground%20Records">Blackground Records</a> and <a href="Virgin%20Records%20America">Virgin Records America</a>.

Aaliyah started to work on the album in 1998, but rescheduled its recording around her developing film career. She resumed recording in 2000 at Sing Sing Studios in Australia, where she shot her role for the 2002 film "<a href="Queen%20of%20the%20Damned%20%28film%29">Queen of the Damned</a>" during the day and recorded songs at night. Through her recording contract with Blackground, the singer worked primarily with the record label's in-house crew of writers and producers, including <a href="Bud%27da">Bud'da</a>, J. Dub, Rapture, and Eric Seats, as well as longtime collaborator <a href="Timbaland">Timbaland</a>.

"Aaliyah" is an R&B and <a href="neo%20soul">neo soul</a> record whose music draws from <a href="funk">funk</a>, <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a>, <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a>, and <a href="electronica">electronica</a>, among other styles. The producers incorporated <a href="synthesizer">synthesizer</a> melodies, fragmented beats, distorted guitar, and eccentrically manipulated vocals and <a href="song%20structure%20%28popular%20music%29">song structures</a>. Much of "Aaliyah" dealt with the complexities of romantic love and different stages in a relationship. Most of the songs were written by lyricist <a href="Static%20Major">Static Major</a>, who shared a close friendship and strong rapport with Aaliyah. She viewed the album as a reflection of herself as both a young adult and a matured vocalist.

"Aaliyah" received highly positive reviews from critics and debuted at number two on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>, but sold diminishingly afterwards. When Blackground and Virgin wanted a high charting single to increase the album's sales, Aaliyah shot a music video for the song "<a href="Rock%20the%20Boat%20%28Aaliyah%20song%29">Rock the Boat</a>" in the Bahamas, but <a href="Death%20of%20Aaliyah">died in a plane crash</a> on a return flight to the United States on August 25. After her death, sales of the album skyrocketed and propelled it to number one on the "Billboard" 200. "Aaliyah" was released during a period of peak activity in contemporary R&B and, since its initial reception, has been cited by critics as one of the best R&B records of its time.

Aaliyah released her second album "<a href="One%20in%20a%20Million%20%28Aaliyah%20album%29">One in a Million</a>" in 1996, and graduated from high school the following year. She gained further exposure with <a href="hit%20song">hit song</a>s from film soundtracks, including her 1998 single "<a href="Are%20You%20That%20Somebody%3F">Are You That Somebody?</a>". After it became the biggest hit of her career at that point, Aaliyah wanted to keep a lower profile and avoid overexposure. A follow-up record was planned for February 1999, but she postponed its recording to develop an acting career, which led to a starring role in the 2000 film "<a href="Romeo%20Must%20Die">Romeo Must Die</a>". The film heightened her profile significantly, while the soundtrack's single "<a href="Try%20Again%20%28Aaliyah%20song%29">Try Again</a>" became her first number-one song on the pop charts. Her label <a href="Blackground%20Records">Blackground Records</a> used the film and its soundtrack to set up a distribution deal with <a href="Virgin%20Records">Virgin Records America</a>, which would distribute Blackground's subsequent releases globally, including her self-titled third album.

Aaliyah began recording the album in 1998. She recorded a few songs, including two with longtime collaborator <a href="Timbaland">Timbaland</a>, before working on "Romeo Must Die". In 1999, while working on the record in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, Aaliyah called and asked <a href="Trent%20Reznor">Trent Reznor</a>, one of her musical idols, to produce a song, but they could not coordinate their schedules. She intended to finish the album by the end of 2000 and resumed its recording while filming in Australia for "<a href="Queen%20of%20the%20Damned%20%28film%29">Queen of the Damned</a>" (2002), as she shot her part for the film during the day and recorded songs at night. She said in an interview for "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>", "there were nights when I didn't go into the studio—I was too tired. On the weekends, I always made it." Jomo Hankerson, Blackground president and Aaliyah's cousin, said that he had to "bribe the producers", who did not want to "go halfway around the world!" He added that they ultimately had "a beautiful time ... making hot music".

Most of the album's songs were recorded at either Sony Studios in New York City or Sing Sing Studios in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, including "Loose Rap", which was done at both studios. Aaliyah recorded "<a href="More%20Than%20a%20Woman%20%28Aaliyah%20song%29">More Than a Woman</a>" at <a href="Manhattan%20Center">Manhattan Center Studios</a>, "U Got Nerve" at Soundtracks Studios in New York City, "<a href="We%20Need%20a%20Resolution">We Need a Resolution</a>" at <a href="Westlake%20Recording%20Studios">Westlake Studios</a>, and "<a href="I%20Care%204%20U%20%28song%29">I Care 4 U</a>" at Magic Mix Studios and Music Grinder Studios in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. She had first recorded "I Care 4 U", written by past collaborator <a href="Missy%20Elliott">Missy Elliott</a>, in 1996 for "One in a Million", but scrapped it after that album's completion. Aaliyah worked with Blackground Records' in-house crew of musicians, songwriters, and producers, including novice producers <a href="Bud%27da">Bud'da</a>, J. Dub, Rapture, and Eric Seats. Music manager <a href="Jimmy%20Henchman">Jimmy Henchman</a>, a friend of Aaliyah's manager <a href="Barry%20Hankerson">Barry Hankerson</a>, helped coordinate the record's production and arranged for the producers and writers to work with the singer.

Most of the album's lyrics were written by <a href="Static%20Major">Static</a>, from the R&B band <a href="Playa%20%28band%29">Playa</a>. While the band was growing apart, he was invited by Blackground to be a lead writer for the album after writing "Are You That Somebody?" and "Try Again". Static was a part of Aaliyah's close group of friends, which included Missy Elliott and Timbaland, and shared an infatuation with her. He found Aaliyah to be ideal for his songwriting style, while she believed that he could accurately portray her feelings. A subtly sexual lyricist, he wrote "<a href="Rock%20the%20Boat%20%28Aaliyah%20song%29">Rock the Boat</a>" for her in 1999, but Blackground felt she was not ready for the song. Barry Hankerson said of his songwriting, "We always were protective over every lyric ... But he did things where you never felt offended. You just felt like you overheard someone thinking ... he was clever ... Aaliyah depended on him [and] he depended on her." Elliott said that he was "a part of that bridge of Aaliyah growing up lyrically". While she discussed the lyrics with Static, the singer consulted Bud'da about the sound and musical direction of the album. She was interested in learning about the <a href="UK%20garage">UK garage</a> scene at the time.

In March 2001, Aaliyah finished recording the album after having filmed her part in "Queen of the Damned" for four months, which ultimately delayed the album's release. In Australia, she also did a photo shoot for "Aaliyah" with photographers <a href="Jeff%20Dunas">Jeff Dunas</a>, <a href="Jonathan%20Mannion">Jonathan Mannion</a>, <a href="David%20LaChapelle">David LaChapelle</a>, and <a href="Albert%20Watson%20%28photographer%29">Albert Watson</a>. The singer handled five <a href="Pythonidae">pythons</a> at the shoot and developed an affinity for snakes, finding them "dangerous, but quite beautiful" and representative of her on the album. She revisited the snake theme in her <a href="music%20video">music video</a> for "We Need a Resolution" in April and told <a href="MTV">MTV</a>, "They live in solitude, [and] there are times in my life [when] I just want to be by myself. There are times I can't even figure myself out. I feel they are very complex creatures, [but] at the same time, they're sexy, too. That's why they represent "Aaliyah" pretty well." She described the record as "a good reflection of [myself] and the person [I am] today", saying in an interview for "<a href="Jet%20%28magazine%29">Jet</a>" magazine, "I am a young adult now, and I think this album shows my growth vocally." "Aaliyah" was <a href="audio%20mastering">mastered</a> by <a href="Bernie%20Grundman">Bernie Grundman</a> at his studio in Los Angeles.

An R&B and <a href="neo%20soul">neo soul</a> album, "Aaliyah" features midtempo <a href="funk">funk</a> songs, <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a>-textured uptempo tracks, and <a href="slow%20jam">slow jam</a>s that drew on older <a href="soul%20music">soul</a> influences. Along with contemporary <a href="Urban%20contemporary">urban</a> sounds, its music incorporates <a href="Middle%20Eastern%20music">Middle-Eastern</a> influences, muted <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a>, and—particularly on Timbaland's songs for the album—<a href="Latin%20American%20music">Latin</a> <a href="timbre">timbre</a>s. "Never No More" mixes both older soul and modern hip hop sounds with <a href="string%20arrangement">string arrangement</a>s by producer Bud'da, while "Read Between the Lines" is a rhythmic, digital <a href="samba">samba</a> with Latin percussion. "Aaliyah"s production features <a href="synthesizer">synthesizer</a> melodies, vintage <a href="Pollard%20Syndrum">syndrums</a>, distorted guitar, <a href="staccato">staccato</a> arrangements, and <a href="Overproduction%20%28music%29">layered</a>, eccentrically manipulated vocals. John Mulvey of "<a href="NME">NME</a>" found its sound subtle and lacking "bombast and histrionics", while the magazine's Alex Needham likened its "otherworldly", <a href="high%20frequency">high frequency</a> production to <a href="Dub%20music">dub reggae</a> and the dark, spacious <a href="electronic%20dance%20music">dance music</a> of <a href="Dr.%20Dre">Dr. Dre</a> and <a href="Massive%20Attack">Massive Attack</a>. In <a href="Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine</a>'s opinion, the album was distinct from the older soul leanings of <a href="Macy%20Gray">Macy Gray</a> and <a href="Jill%20Scott">Jill Scott</a>, as its music sounds unconventional yet modern, "turning out a pan-cultural array of sounds, styles, and emotions".

"Aaliyah"s beats were produced in a manner that made them sound fragmented, exhibiting <a href="techno">techno</a> and <a href="electro%20%28music%29">electro</a> textures. Tracks such as "Loose Rap", "Extra Smooth", and "What If" feature unconventional <a href="song%20structure%20%28popular%20music%29">song structures</a> experimenting with <a href="resolution%20%28music%29">resolution</a>. "I Can Be" and "What If" incorporate <a href="2-step%20garage">2-step</a> and <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> elements, although the latter song draws particularly from <a href="Detroit%20techno">Detroit techno</a> and <a href="industrial%20rock">industrial rock</a>. On the club-influenced "More Than a Woman", Aaliyah sang over harsh-sounding synthesizer and guitar sounds, while "Loose Rap" features underwater noises, low-key <a href="electronica">electronica</a> in the style of <a href="the%20Neptunes">the Neptunes</a>, and harmonically soft vocals declaring "it ain't just rhythm and blues". Ernest Hardy of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" compared the album's experimentation to the sounds on <a href="Outkast">OutKast</a>'s "<a href="Stankonia">Stankonia</a>" (2000), <a href="Sade%20%28band%29">Sade</a>'s "<a href="Lovers%20Rock%20%28Sade%20album%29">Lovers Rock</a>" (2000), and Missy Elliott's "<a href="Miss%20E...%20So%20Addictive">Miss E... So Addictive</a>" (2001). According to "<a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a>"s Sal Cinquemani, "like Elliott's genre-bending "So Addictive", "Aaliyah" provides a missing link between hip-hop and electronica."

The lyrics on "Aaliyah" explore the intricacies of romantic love and phases in a relationship such as heartache, frivolous infatuation, and issues near the end of a relationship. Subtle, lighthearted humor and witty sound effects such as comical vocal manipulation intersperse the themes of heartbreak and eroticism. According to <a href="Citysearch">Citysearch</a>'s Justin Hartung, the record "transforms the confusion of young adulthood into exhilarating freedom", while "Billboard"s Rashaun Hall said each song possessed a unique emotional identity that accompany the music's sonic variety. Bob Waliszewski of "<a href="Plugged%20In">Plugged In</a>" observed female empowerment-themed songs that show a "healthy self-respect" by Aaliyah, who "doesn't put up with unfaithful cads ('You Got Nerve'), mind games ('I Refuse'), self-impressed hunks ('Extra Smooth'), gossip and envy ('Loose Rap'), or physical abuse ('Never No More')". The <a href="Key%20%28music%29">key</a>-<a href="Level%20%28music%29">shifting</a>, <a href="drum%20and%20bass">drum and bass</a>-influenced "Extra Smooth" addresses an enthusiastic courtship and is inspired by a conversation between Aaliyah and Static about how men try to act suave, while "Loose Rap" is titled after the slang phrase of the same name and dismisses romantic admirers who use trite <a href="pick-up%20line">pick-up line</a>s. "Those Were the Days" dispassionately dismisses a male lover, while "What If" angrily threatens an unfaithful lover and by extension similar men. On "I Care 4 U", the narrator tries to console a friend who is heartbroken, but finds herself distressed by <a href="unrequited%20love">unrequited</a> feelings she has for him.
Aaliyah's vocals are in a restrained <a href="soprano">soprano</a> style throughout the album. "<a href="Vibe%20%28magazine%29">Vibe</a>" magazine's Hyun Kim argued that its songs draw focus to her singing more than her previous records, "bringing it to the forefront as opposed to hiding it behind the layered production". "Rock the Boat" was sung with breathless vocals by Aaliyah, who instructs her lover on how to please her sexually and equates her erotic high to a drug high. Ballads such as "I Care 4 U", "Never No More", and "I Refuse" are sung more emotively, expressing melancholy qualities and hurt. On "I Can Be", Aaliyah sings from the perspective of an adulterous man's mistress who wants to be his foremost girlfriend. Alex Macpherson from "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" wrote that "Aaliyah's blank, numbed delivery" on the song "makes being the other woman seem like an emotionally masochistic form of self-medication". Biographer <a href="Christopher%20John%20Farley">Christopher John Farley</a> said she "emotionally detailed a song" unlike on her previous albums and that "her gentle voice now seemed like something elemental, a kindly wind blowing through the branches of a big tree." According to Joshua Clover, Aaliyah pushes <a href="musical%20note">musical note</a>s "into strange corners of <a href="syncopation">syncopation</a>'s shifty architecture" on the more "shape-defying" tracks. He wrote that "she makes the sonics tell the story, creating meaning outside the lyrics, pleasure beyond the <a href="hook%20%28music%29">hooks</a>."

"Aaliyah" was released in July 2001. In the United States, it debuted at number two on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> albums chart, selling 187,000 copies in the week of August 4. Although it was the highest sales week of Aaliyah's career, the album initially sold slower than her previous record, "One in a Million". The singer planned to embark on the largest concert tour of her career to support the album, while Blackground and Virgin—heavily invested in the record's success—wanted a single with a high chart placement to help increase sales. "We Need a Resolution" had been released as the <a href="lead%20single">lead single</a> on April 13, but did not receive significant radio airplay and only reached number fifty-nine on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a>. In August, Aaliyah shot a music video for "More Than a Woman" in Los Angeles and then travelled to the Bahamas to shoot a video for "Rock the Boat". But after its completion, she and several crew members who were returning to the US <a href="Death%20of%20Aaliyah">died in a plane crash</a> on August 25. Blackground executives were uncertain when they would release the album's next single and video.

The album's sales skyrocketed after Aaliyah's death. Its sales had been diminishing since the album's release in July and stood at more than 447,000 copies sold. News of her death was reported on the last day of <a href="Nielsen%20SoundScan">Nielsen SoundScan</a>'s sales tracking week, during which "Aaliyah" sold 62,000 copies, a 41.5% increase from its past week's sales. The following week, it sold 305,500 copies and ascended from number 19 to number one on the "Billboard" 200. It was the record's highest sales week and marked the first time a recording artist climbed to number one posthumously since <a href="John%20Lennon">John Lennon</a> in 1980 with his album "<a href="Double%20Fantasy">Double Fantasy</a>". It was also Aaliyah's only album to top any of "Billboard"s charts. The record sold more than one million copies by September 19 and 2.06 million copies by February 25, 2002. In the US, "Aaliyah" spent 68 weeks on the "Billboard" 200 and, by December 2009, had sold 2.6 million copies.

Blackground, which had ended its joint deal with Virgin in November, wanted to send the video for "More Than a Woman" to domestic outlets, but it required both labels to work together. Blackground subsequently moved to <a href="Universal%20Records">Universal Records</a>, and the video was first aired in Europe. In the United Kingdom, "More Than a Woman" was released as a single on January 7, 2002, and entered the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">singles chart</a> at number one, while "Aaliyah" re-entered the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">albums chart</a> at number 65; it had originally entered the chart at number 25 on July 28, 2001. Two weeks after "More Than a Woman" reached number one, the album jumped 17 spots to number five on January 27, 2002. "Aaliyah" went on to spend 31 weeks on the British charts. It also reached number nine on the record charts in France, Germany, and the Netherlands, where it charted for 33, 41, and 46 weeks, respectively. According to the <a href="International%20Federation%20of%20the%20Phonographic%20Industry">International Federation of the Phonographic Industry</a> (IFPI), the record was the 34th best-selling album in the world during 2001.

"Aaliyah" was met with highly positive reviews from most critics. At <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, which assigns a <a href="standard%20score">normalized rating</a> out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an <a href="weighted%20arithmetic%20mean">average</a> score of 76, based on 14 reviews. Michael Odell of "The Guardian" called it a flawless blend of pop and R&B that was "as much a brochure for the current state of R&B production facilities" as it was a showcase for Aaliyah's singing. He found the music's textures "scintillating" and believed its distinguishing characteristic to be "a playful and confident reworking of the [R&B] canon". In the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>", Brad Cawn wrote that Aaliyah demonstrated <a href="Sade%20Adu">Sade</a>'s grace and Missy Elliott's daring with fashionable neo soul that was "equal parts attitude and harmony, and all urban music perfection", while Russell Baillie from "<a href="The%20New%20Zealand%20Herald">The New Zealand Herald</a>" deemed the music innovative <a href="dance-pop">dance-pop</a> on what he called "a cohesive, detailed and disarmingly enticing album". <a href="Simon%20Price">Simon Price</a>, writing for "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>", cited the record as "further evidence that <a href="African-American%20music">black pop</a> is the <a href="Avant-garde%20music">avant garde</a>". In a review for "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>", <a href="Nathan%20Rabin">Nathan Rabin</a> argued that the album established Aaliyah as a significant artist unobscured by her collaborators, while Hardy from "Rolling Stone" called it "a near-flawless declaration of strength and independence" in which Aaliyah explored her "fantasies and strengths". Writing for "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>", Clover viewed the record as her most profound work and said she had made "art" out of Timbaland and Static's "formal finesse" by "investing sound schemes with urgency and emotional intricacy".

Some reviewers were more qualified in their praise. Mulvey deemed "Aaliyah" "graceful" and "satisfying rather than extraordinary" in his review for "NME". Although he said it was redeemed by Static's consistent songwriting, Timbaland should have contributed more songs in his opinion. Like Mulvey, "<a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">Q</a>" remarked that its music was decent rather than innovative, with some <a href="filler%20%28media%29">filler</a>. In "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>", <a href="Craig%20Seymour">Craig Seymour</a> wrote that there were a few songs that strayed from her musical strengths, but elsewhere she "skillfully portrays love as part woozy thrill, part pulse-racing terror". <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> gave the record a three-star honorable mention, indicating "an enjoyable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well treasure". In his column for "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>", he named "We Need a Resolution" and "U Got Nerve" as highlights and called Aaliyah "a slave to her beats, but a proud slave". Connie Johnson from the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" was more critical, finding the production unadventurous and the lyrics lacking the depth and "personal revelation that gives music some immediacy".

"Aaliyah" was named the best album of 2001 by "Slant Magazine" and one of the ten best records of the year by "<a href="The%20Atlanta%20Journal-Constitution">The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>" and "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine. "NME" ranked it at number 39 on their year-end list. The album finished 73rd in the <a href="Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop</a>, an annual poll of American critics published by "The Village Voice". Christgau, who created and supervised the poll, said Aaliyah finally "developed material nobody can deny" on "a good album". The record also finished 37th in the annual poll run by German music magazine "<a href="Spex%20%28magazine%29">Spex</a>". For the album, Aaliyah was posthumously awarded an <a href="NAACP%20Image%20Award">NAACP Image Award</a> for <a href="NAACP%20Image%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Female%20Artist">Outstanding Female Artist</a>. At the <a href="American%20Music%20Awards%20of%202002">2002 American Music Awards</a>, it won in the category of Favorite R&B/Soul Album. In 2002, "Aaliyah" received a <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a> nomination for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20R%26amp%3BB%20Album">Best R&B Album</a>. "Rock the Boat" was nominated for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Female%20R%26amp%3BB%20Vocal%20Performance">Best Female R&B Vocal Performance</a>. "More Than a Woman" was nominated in the same category in 2003. In 2005, "Aaliyah" was ranked number 66 on "<a href="GQ%20%28magazine%29">GQ</a>"s 2005 list of the "100 Coolest Albums in the World". "<a href="Stylus%20Magazine">Stylus Magazine</a>" ranked it 47 on their list of the "Top 50 Albums of 2000–2005"; the publication's David Drake ranked it eighth on his own list. "Vibe" included it as one of their "150 Essential Albums of the Vibe Era" in 2007. A few years later, "Aaliyah" was named by "Slant Magazine" as the 72nd best record of the 2000s decade.

Along with Aaliyah's burgeoning film career, the album was a part of her rising mainstream success in 2001. In a retrospective review, Steve Huey from <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> called it her most consummate record and said it "completed the singer's image overhaul into a sensual yet sensitive adult". Erlewine, the website's senior editor, regarded the album as "a statement of maturity and a stunning artistic leap forward", while "<a href="BBC%20Music">BBC Music</a>"s Daryl Easlea felt it made Aaliyah's two previous accomplished albums "look like exercises in <a href="wikt%3Ajuvenilia">juvenilia</a>". According to "<a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>" journalist Quentin B. Huff, she had never used her singing to complement her music's innovative production before with as much variety, conviction, and success as on "Aaliyah", which he said was also known as "The Red Album" because of its red artwork. Huff believed the record showcased the growing rapport between the singer and her collaborators while disproving questions about how she would continue recording music while broadening her profile. In "<a href="The%20Rolling%20Stone%20Album%20Guide">The Rolling Stone Album Guide</a>" (2004), Keith Harris wrote that "Aaliyah had grown from studio puppet to a powerful R&B archetype—a more self-aware <a href="Ronnie%20Spector">Ronnie Spector</a> for a time that requires more self-awareness of its young adults."

Aaliyah's re-emergence with the album in mid-2001 had coincided with a period of peak activity in contemporary R&B, as well as the popularity of neo soul. According to Erlewine, "Aaliyah" was "one of the strongest urban soul records of its time", while "The Guardian" cited it as the peak of R&B's golden age at the "turn of the century". <a href="Alexis%20Petridis">Alexis Petridis</a>, the newspaper's lead critic, believed Aaliyah had recorded her most engaging music in a year when R&B and hip hop demonstrated the most creativity in popular music. "The Guardian"s Rebecca Nicholson attributed Timbaland's subsequent commercial success with singers such as <a href="Justin%20Timberlake">Justin Timberlake</a> and <a href="Nelly%20Furtado">Nelly Furtado</a> to his experience producing "Aaliyah", writing that he "hasn't come close to creating anything as sonically stunning since". Although Jon Caramanica from "Vibe" believed it "redefines the category", he said "Aaliyah" "may be the best soul album of the young millenium", calling its music "daring in construction, gorgeous from conception ... damn near post-R&B". "Q" journalist Eve Barlow credited the album for "creating a blueprint that can be heard across pop music today" with acts such as R&B singers <a href="Beyonc%C3%A9">Beyoncé</a> and <a href="The%20Weeknd">The Weeknd</a>, and indie pop band <a href="The%20xx">The xx</a>.

The recording sessions for "Aaliyah" produced many leftover tracks that were posthumously archived by Blackground and mostly left unreleased because of internal conflicts and legal complications between the label, Aaliyah's family, and the producers. The compilation album "<a href="I%20Care%204%20U">I Care 4 U</a>" was released in 2002 and featured six previously unreleased songs from the sessions.

Not One Less

Not One Less is a 1999 <a href="Drama%20%28film%20and%20television%29">drama film</a> by Chinese director <a href="Zhang%20Yimou">Zhang Yimou</a>, adapted from <a href="Shi%20Xiangsheng">Shi Xiangsheng</a>'s 1997 story "A Sun in the Sky" (). It was produced by Guangxi Film Studio and released by <a href="China%20Film%20Group%20Corporation">China Film Group Corporation</a> in <a href="mainland%20China">mainland China</a>, and distributed by <a href="Sony%20Pictures%20Classics">Sony Pictures Classics</a> and <a href="Sony%20Pictures%20Motion%20Picture%20Group">Columbia TriStar</a> internationally.

Set in the <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">People's Republic of China</a> during the 1990s, the film centers on a 13-year-old substitute teacher, Wei Minzhi, in the <a href="Rural%20society%20in%20China">Chinese countryside</a>. Called in to substitute for a village teacher for one month, Wei is told not to lose any students. When one of the boys takes off in search of work in the big city, she goes looking for him. The film addresses <a href="Education%20in%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China%23Development">education reform in China</a>, the economic gap between urban and rural populations, and the prevalence of bureaucracy and authority figures in everyday life. It is filmed in a <a href="Neorealism%20%28art%29">neorealist</a>/<a href="documentary%20film">documentary</a> style with a troupe of non-professional actors who play characters with the same names and occupations as the actors have in real life, blurring the boundaries between drama and reality.

The domestic release of "Not One Less" was accompanied by a Chinese government campaign aimed at promoting the film and cracking down on <a href="Copyright%20infringement">piracy</a>. Internationally, the film was generally well-received, but it also attracted criticism for its ostensibly political message; foreign critics are divided on whether the film should be read as praising or criticizing the Chinese government. When the film was excluded from the <a href="1999%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BCannes%20Film%20Festival">1999 Cannes Film Festival</a>'s competition section, Zhang withdrew it and another film from the festival, and published a letter rebuking Cannes for politicization of and "discrimination" against Chinese cinema. The film went on to win the <a href="Venice%20Film%20Festival">Venice Film Festival</a>'s <a href="Golden%20Lion">Golden Lion</a> and several other awards, and Zhang won the award for best director at the <a href="Golden%20Rooster%20Awards">Golden Rooster Awards</a>.

In the 1990s, primary education reform had become one of the top priorities in the People's Republic of China. About 160 million Chinese people had missed all or part of their education because of the <a href="Cultural%20Revolution">Cultural Revolution</a> in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and in 1986 the <a href="National%20People%27s%20Congress">National People's Congress</a> enacted a law calling for nine years of compulsory education. By 1993, it was clear that much of the country was making little progress on implementing nine-year compulsory education, so the 1993–2000 seven-year plan focused on this goal. One of the major challenges educators faced was the large number of rural schoolchildren dropping out to pursue work. Another issue was a large urban–rural divide: funding and teacher quality were far better in urban schools than rural, and urban students stayed in school longer.

"Not One Less" was Zhang Yimou's ninth film, but only the second not to star long-time collaborator <a href="Gong%20Li">Gong Li</a> (the first was his 1997 "<a href="Keep%20Cool%20%28film%29">Keep Cool</a>"). For this film, he cast only amateur actors whose real-life names and occupations resembled those of characters they played in the film—as "<a href="The%20Philadelphia%20Inquirer">The Philadelphia Inquirer</a>"s Steven Rea described the performances, the actors are just "people playing variations of themselves in front of the camera". For instance, Tian Zhenda, who played the mayor, was the real-life mayor of a small village, and the primary actors Wei Minzhi and Zhang Huike were selected from among thousands of students in rural schools. (The names and occupations of the film's main actors are listed in the table below.) The movie was filmed on location at <a href="Chicheng%20County">Chicheng County</a>'s Shuiquan Primary School, and in the city of <a href="Zhangjiakou">Zhangjiakou</a>; both locations are in <a href="Hebei">Hebei</a> province.

The movie was filmed in a <a href="Documentary%20film">documentary</a>-like, "<a href="Neorealism%20%28art%29">neorealist</a>" style involving hidden cameras and natural lighting. There are also, however, elements of heavy editing—for example, Shelly Kraicer noted that many scenes have frequent, rapid <a href="cut%20%28transition%29">cuts</a>, partially as a result of filming with inexperienced actors.

Zhang had to work closely with government censors during production of the film. He related how the censors "kept reminding [me] not to show China as too backward and too poor", and said that on the title cards at the end of the movie he had to write that the number of rural children dropping out of school each year was one million, although he believed the number was actually three times that. "Not One Less" was Zhang's first film to enjoy government support and resources.

Thirteen-year-old Wei Minzhi arrives in Shuiquan village to substitute for the village's only teacher (Gao Enman) while he takes a month's leave to care for his ill mother. When Gao discovers that Wei does not have a high school education and has no special talents, he instructs her to teach by copying his texts onto the board and then making the students copy them into their notebooks; he also tells her not to use more than one piece of chalk per day, because the village is too poor to afford more. Before leaving, he explains to her that many students have recently left school to find work in the cities, and he offers her a 10 <a href="Chinese%20yuan">yuan</a> bonus if all the students are still there when he returns.
When Wei begins teaching, she has little rapport with the students: they shout and run around instead of copying their work, and the class troublemaker, Zhang Huike, insists that "she's not a teacher, she's Wei Chunzhi's big sister!" After putting the lesson on the board, Wei usually sits outside, guarding the door to make sure no students leave until they have finished their work. Early in the month, a sports recruiter comes to take one athletic girl, Ming Xinhong, to a special training school; unwilling to let any students leave, Wei hides Ming, and when the village mayor (Tian Zhenda) finds her, Wei chases after their car in a futile attempt to stop them; and yet they, the sports recruiter and mayor, first notice and comment on Wei's running ability, endurance, and tenacity. 

One day, after trying to make the troublemaker Zhang apologize for bothering another student, Wei discovers that Zhang has left to go find work in the nearby city of <a href="Zhangjiakou">Zhangjiakou</a>. The village mayor is unwilling to give her money for a bus ticket to the city, so she resolves to earn the money herself, and recruits the remaining students to help. One girl suggests that they can make money by moving bricks in a nearby brickyard, and Wei begins giving the students mathematical exercises centered on finding out how much money they need to earn for the bus tickets, how many bricks they need to move, and how much time it will take. Through these exercises and working to earn money, her rapport with the class improves. After earning the money, she reaches the bus station but learns that the price is higher than she thought, and she cannot afford a ticket. Wei ends up walking most of the way to Zhangjiakou.

In the city, Wei finds the people that Zhang was supposed to be working with, only to discover that they had lost him at the train station days before. She forces another girl her age, Sun Zhimei, to help her look for Zhang at the train station, but they do not find him. Wei has no success finding Zhang through the <a href="public%20address%20system">public address system</a> and "missing person" posters, so she goes to the local television station to broadcast a missing person notice. The receptionist (Feng Yuying) will not let her in without valid identification, though, and says the only way she can enter is with permission from the station manager, whom she describes as "a man with glasses". For the rest of the day, Wei stands by the station's only gate, stopping every man with glasses, but she does not find the station manager, and spends the night asleep on the street. The next day the station manager (Wu Wanlu) sees her at the gate again, through his window, and lets her in, scolding the receptionist for making her wait outside.

Although Wei has no money to run an ad on TV, the station manager is interested in her story and decides to feature Wei in a talk show special about rural education. On the talk show, Wei is nervous and hardly says a word when the host (Li Fanfan) addresses her, but Zhang—who has been wandering the streets begging for food—sees the show. After Wei and Zhang are reunited, the station manager arranges to have them driven back to Shuiquan village, along with a truckload of school supplies and donations that viewers had sent in. Upon their return, they are greeted by the whole village. In the final scene, Wei presents the students with several boxes of colored chalk that were donated, and allows each student to write one character on the board. The film ends with a series of title cards that recount the actions of the characters after the film ends, and describe the problem of poverty in rural education in China.

While most of Zhang's early films had been <a href="historical%20epic">historical epic</a>s, "Not One Less" was one of the first to focus on contemporary China. The film's main theme involves the difficulties faced in providing rural education in China. When Wei Minzhi arrives in Shuiquan village, the teacher Gao has not been paid in six months and the school building is in disrepair, and chalk is in such short supply that Gao gives Wei specific instructions limiting how large her written characters should be. Wei sleeps in the school building, sharing a bed with several female students. The version of the film released overseas ends with a series of title cards in English, the last of which reads, "Each year, poverty forces one million children in China to leave school. Through the help of donations, about 15% of these children return to school."
Because the people and locations used in the film are real but are carefully selected and edited, the film creates a "friction" between documentary reality and narrative fiction. This balancing act between the real and the imaginary has drawn comparisons to neorealist works such as those of <a href="Iranian%20people">Iranian</a> directors <a href="Abbas%20Kiarostami">Abbas Kiarostami</a> and <a href="Mohsen%20Makhmalbaf">Mohsen Makhmalbaf</a>, and Zhang has openly acknowledged the influence of Kiarostami in this film. Zhang Xiaoling of the <a href="University%20of%20Nottingham">University of Nottingham</a> argues that Zhang Yimou used the documentary perspective in order to suggest that the story is an accurate reflection of most rural areas in China, while Shelly Kraicer believes that his "simultaneous presentation of seemingly opposing messages" is a powerful artistic method in of itself, and that it allows Zhang to circumvent censors by guaranteeing that the movie will include at least one message that they like. Jean-Michel Frodon of "<a href="Le%20Monde">Le Monde</a>" maintains that the film was produced "in the shadow of two superpowers" and needed to make compromises with each.

The film addresses the prominent place that bureaucracy, and verbal negotiation and struggle, occupy in everyday life in China. Many scenes pit Wei against authority figures such as the village mayor, the announcer in the train station, and the TV station receptionist who also acts as a "gatekeeper". Aside from Wei, many characters in the film show a "blind faith" in authority figures. While she lacks money and power, Wei overcomes her obstacles through sheer obstinacy and ignorant persistence, suggesting that speech and perseverance can overcome barriers. Wei becomes an example of "heroic obstinacy" and a model of using determination to face "overwhelming odds". For this reason, the film has been frequently compared to Zhang's 1993 "<a href="The%20Story%20of%20Qiu%20Ju">The Story of Qiu Ju</a>", whose heroine is also a determined, stubborn woman; likewise, "Qiu Ju" is also filmed in a neo-realistic style, set partially in contemporary rural China and partially in the city, and employs mostly amateur actors.

"Not One Less" portrays the mass media as a locus of power: Wei discovers that only someone with money or connections can gain access to a television station, but once someone is on camera she or he becomes part of an "invisible <a href="media%20hegemony">media hegemony</a>" with the power to "manipulate social behavior", catching people's attention where paper advertisements could not and moving cityfolk to donate money to a country school. The power of television within the film's story, according to Laikwan Pang of the <a href="Chinese%20University%20of%20Hong%20Kong">Chinese University of Hong Kong</a>, reflects its prominent place in Chinese society of the late 1990s, when domestic cinema was floundering but television was developing quickly; Pang argues that television-watching forms a "collective consciousness" for Chinese citizens, and that the way television unifies people in "Not One Less" is an illustration of this.
Money is important throughout the film. Concerns about money dominate much of the film—for example, a large portion is devoted to Wei and her students' attempt to earn enough money for bus tickets—as well as motivating them. Most major characters, including Wei, demand payment for their actions, and it is left unclear whether Wei's search for Zhang Huike is motivated by altruism or by the promise of a 10-yuan bonus. Zhu Ying points out the prominence of money in the film creates a conflict between traditional <a href="Confucianism">Confucian</a> values (such as the implication that the solutions to Wei's problems can be found through the help of authority figures) and modern, <a href="Capitalism">capitalist</a> and <a href="Individualism">individualistic</a> society.

Finally, the film illustrates the growing urban–rural divide in China. When Wei reaches Zhangjiakou, the film creates a clear contrast between urban and rural life, and the two locations are physically separated by a dark tunnel. The city is not portrayed as idyllic; rather, Zhang shows that rural people are faced with difficulties and discrimination in the cities. While Wei's first view of the city exposes her to well-dressed people and modern buildings, the living quarters she goes to while searching for Zhang Huike are cramped and squalid. Likewise, the iron gate where Wei waits all day for the TV station director reflects the barriers poor people face to survival in the city, and the necessity of <a href="guanxi">connections</a> to avoid becoming an "outsider" in the city. Frequent cuts show Wei and Zhang wandering aimlessly in the streets, Zhang begging for food, and Wei sleeping on the sidewalk; when an enthusiastic TV host later asks Zhang what part of the city left the biggest impression, Zhang replies that the one thing he will never forget is having to beg for food. A.O. Scott of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" compared the "unbearable" despair of the film's second half to that of <a href="Vittorio%20De%20Sica">Vittorio De Sica</a>'s 1948 "<a href="Bicycle%20Thieves">Bicycle Thieves</a>".

Neither "Not One Less" nor Zhang's other 1999 film "<a href="The%20Road%20Home%20%281999%20film%29">The Road Home</a>" was selected for the 1999 Cannes Film Festival's Official Selection, the most prestigious competition in the festival, where several of Zhang's earlier films had won awards. The rationale is uncertain; Shelly Kraicer and Zhang Xiaoling claim that Cannes officials viewed the "Not One Less" happy ending, with the main characters' conflicts resolved by the generosity of city dwellers and higher-up officials, as pro-China propaganda, while Zhu Ying claims that the officials saw it and "The Road Home" as too "anti"-government. Rather than have his films shown in a less competitive portion of the festival, Zhang withdrew them both in protest, stating that the movies were apolitical. In an open letter published in the "<a href="Beijing%20Youth%20Daily">Beijing Youth Daily</a>", Zhang accused the festival of being motivated by other than artistic concerns, and criticized the Western perception that all Chinese films must be either "pro-government" or "anti-government", referring to it as a "discrimination against Chinese films".

<a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> gave it a "fresh" 95% approval rating, based on 43 reviews and <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> gave it a 73, signifying "generally favorable reviews". Many focused on the film's ending title cards: several compared them to a <a href="public%20service%20announcement">public service announcement</a>, and Philip Kemp of "<a href="Sight%20%26amp%3B%20Sound">Sight & Sound</a>" wrote, "All that's missing is the address we should send donations to." Zhang Xiaoling, on the other hand, considered the titles to be an implicit criticism of the state of rural education in China, saying, "the news that voluntary contributions have helped 15 percent of the pupils to return to school is aimed to give rise to a question: what about the remaining 85 percent?" The disagreement about the title cards is also reflected in the critical reaction to the rest of the film's resolution. Kemp described the ending as "feelgood" and criticized the film for portraying officials and generous cityfolk as coming to the rescue, "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>"s Desson Howe called the ending "flag-waving", and "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>"s <a href="Gilbert%20Adair">Gilbert Adair</a> called it "sugary". Alberto Barbera of the <a href="Venice%20Film%20Festival">Venice Film Festival</a>, on the other hand, said that while the end of the film may have been like propaganda, the rest was a "strong denunciation of a regime that is unable to assure proper education for the country children". Likewise, Zhang Xiaoling argued that although the film superficially appears to praise the city people and officials, its <a href="subtext">subtext</a> is harshly critical of them: he pointed out that the apparently benevolent TV station manager seems to be motivated more by audience ratings than by altruism, that the receptionist's callous manner towards Wei is a result of Chinese "bureaucratism and nepotism", and that for all the good things about the city, Zhang Huike's clearest memory of city life is having to beg for food. Zhang and Kraicer both argued that critics who see the film as pro-government propaganda are missing the point and, as Kraicer put it, "mistaking [one] layer as the message of the film ... mistaking the part for the whole". David Ansen of "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" and Leigh Paatsch of the "<a href="Herald%20Sun">Herald Sun</a>" each pointed out that, while the film is "deceptive[ly]" positive at face value, it has harsh criticism "bubbling under the surface". Chinese critics Liu Xinyi and Xu Su of "Movie Review" recognized the dispute abroad over whether the film was pro- or anti-government, but made no comment; they praised the film for its realistic portrayal of hardships facing rural people, without speculating about whether Zhang intended to criticize or praise the government's handling of those hardships. Hao Jian of "Film Appreciation", on the other hand, was more critical, claiming that the movie was organized around a political message and was intended to be pro-government. Hao said that "Not One Less" marked the beginning of Zhang's transformation from an outspoken independent director to one of the government's favorites.

Overall, critics were impressed with the performances of the amateur actors, and Jean-Michel Frodon of "<a href="Le%20Monde">Le Monde</a>" called that the film's greatest success. Peter Rainer of "<a href="New%20York%20Magazine">New York Magazine</a>" praised the scene of Wei's interview on TV as "one of the most improbably satisfying love scenes on film". The film also received praise for its artistic merits and <a href="Hou%20Yong%20%28cinematographer%29">Hou Yong</a>'s cinematography, even though its visuals were simplistic compared to Zhang's previous films; for example, A.O. Scott of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" praised the "richness" displayed by the film despite its deliberate scarcity of color. Reviewers also pointed out that Zhang had succeeded in breaking away from the "commercial entertainment wave" of popular film. Noel Vera of "<a href="BusinessWorld">BusinessWorld</a>" writes that the film concerns itself mainly with emotional impact, at the expense of visual extravagance, making it the opposite of earlier Zhang Yimou films such as "<a href="Red%20Sorghum%20%28film%29">Red Sorghum</a>". Other critics noted the strength of the film's storytelling; for instance, Rainer called the film an "uncommon, and uncommonly moving, love story", and "<a href="Film%20Journal%20International">Film Journal International</a>"s Kevin Lally described it as "a poignant story of poverty and spirit reminiscent of the great <a href="Italian%20neo-realism">Italian neo-realists</a>." Another well-received part of the film was the segment in which Wei teaches math by creating practical examples out of her attempt to raise money for the bus to Zhangjiakou; in the Chinese journal "Teacher Doctrines", Mao Wen wrote that teachers should learn from Wei's example and provide students with practical exercises.

Wei Minzhi's character received mixed reactions: Scott described her as a "heroic" character who demonstrates how obstinacy can be a virtue, whereas Richard Corliss of "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" says she is "no brighter or more resourceful than [her students]". Reactions to the city portion of the movie were also mixed: while Zhang describes the second half of the film as an eloquent commentary on China's urban-rural divide and Kevin Lally calls it "startling", Kemp criticizes it for being a predictable "Victorian cliché".

Rights to distribute the film were purchased by the China Film Group Corporation, a state-sponsored organization, and the government actively promoted the film. It was officially released in mainland China in , although there were showings as early as mid-February. Sheldon H. Lu reports that the film grossed <a href="Renminbi">¥</a>18 million, an average amount, in its first three months of showing; by the end of its run in November, it sold ¥40 million at the box office. (In comparison, Zhang's 2002 film "<a href="Hero%20%282002%20film%29">Hero</a>" would earn ¥270 million three years later.) Nevertheless, "Not One Less" was the highest-grossing domestic film of 1999, and Laikwan Pang has called it a "box office success". In the United States, the film was released in theaters on 2000, and grossed $50,256 in its first weekend and $592,586 overall; The release was handled by <a href="Sony%20Pictures%20Classics">Sony Pictures Classics</a>, and home video distribution by <a href="Sony%20Pictures%20Motion%20Picture%20Group">Columbia TriStar</a>; "Not One Less" was Columbia's first Chinese film.

Lu warns that domestic box office sales are not reliable indicators of a film's popularity in mainland China, because of piracy and because of state or social group sponsorship; many workers were given free tickets to promote the film, and a 1999 report claimed that more tickets were purchased by the government than by individuals. The film was more popular than most government-promoted films touting the party line and Lu claims that it had "tremendous social support", but Pang points out that its success was "not purely egalitarian, but partly constructed."

At the time of "Not One Less" release, DVD and VCD piracy was a growing concern in mainland China, and the <a href="Intellectual%20property%20in%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">China Copyright Office</a> issued a notice forbidding unauthorized production or distribution of the film. This was the first time China had enacted special copyright protections for a domestic film. On 1999, <a href="Hubei">Hubei</a> province's <a href="Culture%20Office">Culture Office</a> issued an "Urgent Notice for Immediate Confiscation of Pirated "Not One Less" VCDs", and two days later the Culture Office and movie company joined forces to conduct raids on ten audio-video stores, seizing pirated discs from six of them.

Although it was withdrawn from Cannes, "Not One Less" went on to win the <a href="Golden%20Lion">Golden Lion</a>, the top award at the <a href="Venice%20Film%20Festival">Venice Film Festival</a>. Zhang also received a best director award at the <a href="Golden%20Rooster%20Award">Golden Rooster</a>, mainland China's most prestigious award ceremony, and the film was voted one of the top three of the year in the <a href="Hundred%20Flowers%20Awards">Hundred Flowers Awards</a>. Awards the film won or was nominated for are listed below.

Bengali language movement

The Bengali Language Movement ( "Bhasha Andolôn") was a political movement in former <a href="East%20Pakistan">East Pakistan</a> (currently <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>) advocating the recognition of the <a href="Bengali%20language">Bengali language</a> as an <a href="official%20language">official language</a> of the then-<a href="Dominion%20of%20Pakistan">Dominion of Pakistan</a> in order to allow its use in government affairs, the continuation of its use as a medium of education, its use in media, currency and stamps, and to maintain its writing in the <a href="Bengali%20script">Bengali script</a>.

When the Dominion of Pakistan was formed by the <a href="partition%20of%20India">partition of India</a> in 1947, it was composed of various ethnic and linguistic groups, with the geographically non-contiguous East Bengal province (that was <a href="One%20Unit">renamed</a> in 1956 as <a href="East%20Pakistan">East Pakistan</a>) having a mainly <a href="Bengali%20people">Bengali</a> population. In 1948, the <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Pakistan">Government of the Dominion of Pakistan</a> ordained <a href="Urdu">Urdu</a> as the sole national language, sparking extensive protests among the Bengali-speaking majority of East Bengal. Facing rising sectarian tensions and mass discontent with the new law, the government outlawed public meetings and rallies. The students of the <a href="University%20of%20Dhaka">University of Dhaka</a> and other political activists defied the law and organised a protest on 21 February 1952. The movement reached its climax when police killed student demonstrators on that day. The deaths provoked widespread civil unrest. After years of conflict, the central government relented and granted official status to the Bengali language in 1956.

The Language Movement catalysed the assertion of Bengali national identity in East Bengal and later East Pakistan, and became a forerunner to Bengali nationalist movements, including the <a href="6%20Point%20Movement">6-Point Movement</a> and subsequently the <a href="Bangladesh%20Liberation%20War">Bangladesh Liberation War</a> and <a href="Indo-Pakistani%20War%20of%201971">Indo-Pakistani War of 1971</a>. In Bangladesh, 21 February ("Ekushey February") is observed as <a href="Language%20Movement%20Day">Language Movement Day</a>, a national holiday. The <a href="Shaheed%20Minar%2C%20Dhaka">Shaheed Minar</a> monument was constructed near Dhaka Medical College in memory of the movement and its victims. In 1999, <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> declared 21 February as <a href="International%20Mother%20Language%20Day">International Mother Language Day</a>, in tribute to the Language Movement and the ethno-linguistic rights of people around the world.

The current nations, Pakistan and Bangladesh, were part of an undivided India during the British colonial rule. From the mid-19th century, the <a href="Urdu">Urdu</a> language had been promoted as the "<a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a>" of <a href="Islam%20in%20India">Indian Muslims</a> by political and religious leaders, such as <a href="Khwaja%20Salimullah">Sir Khwaja Salimullah</a>, <a href="Sir%20Syed%20Ahmed%20Khan">Sir Syed Ahmed Khan</a>, <a href="Nawab%20Viqar-ul-Mulk">Nawab Viqar-ul-Mulk</a> and <a href="Maulvi%20Abdul%20Haq">Maulvi Abdul Haq</a>. Urdu is an <a href="Indo-Aryan%20languages">Indo-Aryan language</a> of the <a href="Indo-Iranian%20languages">Indo-Iranian branch</a>, belonging to the <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European</a> family of languages. It developed under <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a>, <a href="Arabic%20Language">Arabic</a> and <a href="Turkic%20languages">Turkic</a> influence on <a href="apabhramsha">apabhramsha</a>s (last linguistic stage of the medieval Indian Aryan language <a href="Pali">Pali</a>-<a href="Prakrit">Prakrit</a>) in South Asia during the <a href="Delhi%20Sultanate">Delhi Sultanate</a> and <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal Empire</a>. With its <a href="Perso-Arabic%20script">Perso-Arabic script</a>, the language was considered a vital element of the Islamic culture for Indian Muslims; <a href="Hindi">Hindi</a> and the <a href="Devanagari%20script">Devanagari script</a> were seen as fundamentals of <a href="Hinduism">Hindu culture</a>.

While the use of Urdu grew common with Muslims in northern India, the Muslims of <a href="Bengal">Bengal</a> (a province in the eastern part of British Indian sub-continent) primarily used the Bengali language. Bengali is an <a href="List%20of%20Eastern%20Indo-Aryan%20languages">Eastern Indo-Aryan language</a> that arose from the eastern <a href="Middle%20Indic%20languages">Middle Indic languages</a> around 1000 CE and developed considerably during the <a href="Bengal%20Renaissance">Bengal Renaissance</a>. As early as the late 19th century, social activists such as the <a href="Islamic%20feminism">Muslim feminist</a> <a href="Roquia%20Sakhawat%20Hussain">Roquia Sakhawat Hussain</a> were choosing to write in Bengali to reach out to the people and develop it as a modern literary language. Supporters of Bengali opposed Urdu even before the <a href="partition%20of%20India">partition of India</a>, when delegates from Bengal rejected the idea of making Urdu the lingua franca of Muslim India in the 1937 <a href="Lucknow">Lucknow</a> session of the <a href="All-India%20Muslim%20League">Muslim League</a>. The Muslim League was a <a href="British%20India">British India</a>n political party that became the driving force behind the creation of <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> as a <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> state separate from British India.

After the partition of India in 1947, Bengali-speaking people in <a href="East%20Bengal">East Bengal</a>, the non-contiguous eastern part of the <a href="Dominion%20of%20Pakistan">Dominion of Pakistan</a>, made up 44 million of the newly formed Dominion of Pakistan's 69 million people. The Dominion of Pakistan's government, civil services, and military, however, were dominated by personnel from the western wing of the Dominion of Pakistan. In 1947, a key resolution at a national education summit in <a href="Karachi">Karachi</a> advocated Urdu as the sole state language, and its exclusive use in the media and in schools. Opposition and protests arose immediately. Students from Dhaka rallied under the leadership of <a href="Principal%20Abul%20Kashem">Abul Kashem</a>, the secretary of <a href="Tamaddun%20Majlish">Tamaddun Majlish</a>, a Bengali Islamic cultural organisation. The meeting stipulated Bengali as an official language of the Dominion of Pakistan and as a medium of education in East Bengal. However, the <a href="Pakistan%20Public%20Service%20Commission">Pakistan Public Service Commission</a> removed Bengali from the list of approved subjects, as well as from currency notes and stamps. The central education minister Fazlur Rahman made extensive preparations to make Urdu the only state language of the Dominion of Pakistan. Public outrage spread, and many Bengali students met on the University of Dhaka campus on 8 December 1947 to formally demand that Bengali be made an official language. To promote their cause, Bengali students organised processions and rallies in Dhaka.

Leading Bengali scholars argued why Urdu should not be the only state language. The writer <a href="Abul%20Mansur%20Ahmed">Abul Mansur Ahmed</a> said if Urdu became the state language, the educated society of East Bengal would become 'illiterate' and 'ineligible' for government positions. The first <a href="Rastrabhasa%20Sangram%20Parishad">Rastrabhasa Sangram Parishad</a> (National Language Action Committee), an organisation in favour of Bengali as a state language was formed towards the end of December 1947. Professor <a href="Nurul%20Huq%20Bhuiyan">Nurul Huq Bhuiyan</a> of the Tamaddun Majlish convened the committee. Later, Parliament member <a href="Shamsul%20Huq">Shamsul Huq</a> convened a new committee to push for Bengali as a state language. Assembly member <a href="Dhirendranath%20Datta">Dhirendranath Datta</a> proposed legislation in the <a href="Constituent%20Assembly%20of%20Pakistan">Constituent Assembly of Pakistan</a> to allow members to speak in Bengali and authorise its use for official purposes. Datta's proposal was supported by legislators Prem Hari Burman, <a href="Bhupendra%20Kumar%20Datta">Bhupendra Kumar Datta</a> and Sris Chandra Chattaopadhyaya of East Bengal, as well as the people from the region. Prime minister <a href="Liaquat%20Ali%20Khan">Liaquat Ali Khan</a> and the Muslim League denounced the proposal as an attempt to divide the Pakistani people, thus the legislation was defeated.

Students of the <a href="University%20of%20Dhaka">University of Dhaka</a> and other colleges of the city organised a general strike on 11 March 1948 to protest the omission of Bengali language from official use, including coins, stamps and recruitment tests for the navy. The movement restated the demand that Bengali be declared an official language of the Dominion of Pakistan. Political leaders such as Shamsul Huq, <a href="Shawkat%20Ali">Shawkat Ali</a>, <a href="M%20Sirajul%20Islam">M Sirajul Islam</a>, <a href="Kazi%20Golam%20Mahboob">Kazi Golam Mahboob</a>, <a href="Oli%20Ahad">Oli Ahad</a>, Abdul Wahed and others were arrested during the rallies. Rally leader <a href="Mohammad%20Toaha">Mohammad Toaha</a> was hospitalised after attempting to snatch a rifle from a police officer. Student leaders, including <a href="Abdul%20Matin%20%28language%20activist%29">Abdul Matin</a> and <a href="Abdul%20Malek%20Ukil">Abdul Malek Ukil</a> took part in the procession.

In the afternoon of 11 March, a meeting was held to protest police brutality and arrests. A group of students marching towards the chief minister <a href="Khawaja%20Nazimuddin">Khawaja Nazimuddin</a>'s house was stopped in front of the <a href="Dhaka%20High%20Court">Dhaka High Court</a>. The rally changed its direction and moved in the direction of the Secretariat building. Police attacked the procession injuring several students and leaders, including <a href="A.%20K.%20Fazlul%20Huq">A. K. Fazlul Huq</a>. Continuing strikes were observed the following four days. Under such circumstances, the chief minister Nazimuddin signed an accord with the student leaders agreeing to some terms and conditions, without complying to the demand that Bengali be made a state language.

In the height of civic unrest, <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Pakistan">Governor-General of Pakistan</a> <a href="Muhammad%20Ali%20Jinnah">Muhammad Ali Jinnah</a> arrived in Dhaka on 19 March 1948. On 21 March, at a civic reception at <a href="Suhrawardy%20Udyan">Racecourse Ground</a>, he claimed that the language issue was designed by a "<a href="fifth%20column">fifth column</a>" to divide Pakistani Muslims. Jinnah further declared that "Urdu, and only Urdu" embodied the spirit of Muslim nations and would remain as the state language, labelling those who disagreed with his views as "Enemies of Pakistan". Jinnah delivered a similar speech at <a href="Curzon%20Hall">Curzon Hall</a> of the University of Dhaka on 24 March. At both meetings, Jinnah was interrupted by large segments of the audience. He later called a meeting of a state language committee of action, and overruled the contract that was signed by Khawaja Nazimuddin with the student leaders. Before Jinnah left Dhaka on 28 March, he delivered a speech on radio reasserting his "Urdu-only" policy.

Shortly thereafter, the East Bengal Language Committee, presided by <a href="Akram%20Khan%20%28politician%29">Maulana Akram Khan</a>, was formed by the East Bengal government to prepare a report on the language problem. The Committee completed its report on 6 December 1950, but it was not published until 1958. The government suggested that Bengali be written in <a href="Arabic%20alphabet">Arabic script</a>, as a potential solution to the language conflict.

The Urdu-Bengali controversy was reignited when Jinnah's successor, governor-general <a href="Khawaja%20Nazimuddin">Khawaja Nazimuddin</a>, staunchly defended the "Urdu-only" policy in a speech on 27 January 1952. On 31 January, the "<a href="Shorbodolio%20Kendrio%20Rashtrobhasha%20Kormi%20Porishod">Shorbodolio Kendrio Rashtrobhasha Kormi Porishod</a>" (All-Party Central Language Action Committee) was formed in a meeting at the Bar Library Hall of the University of Dhaka, chaired by <a href="Maulana%20Bhashani">Maulana Bhashani</a>. The central government's proposal of writing the Bengali language in <a href="Arabic%20script">Arabic script</a> was vehemently opposed at the meeting. The action committee called for an all out protest on 21 February, including strikes and rallies. In an attempt to prevent the demonstration, the government imposed <a href="Section%20144">Section 144</a> in Dhaka, thereby banning any gathering.

At nine o'clock in the morning, students began gathering on the University of Dhaka premises in defiance of Section 144. The university vice-chancellor and other officials were present as armed police surrounded the campus. By a quarter past eleven, students gathered at the university gate and attempted to break the police line. Police fired <a href="tear%20gas">tear gas</a> shells towards the gate to warn the students. A section of students ran into the Dhaka Medical College while others rallied towards the university premises cordoned by the police. The vice-chancellor asked police to stop firing and ordered the students to leave the area. However, the police arrested several students for violating section 144 as they attempted to leave. Enraged by the arrests, the students met around the <a href="East%20Bengal%20Legislative%20Assembly">East Bengal Legislative Assembly</a> and blocked the legislators' way, asking them to present their insistence at the assembly. When a group of students sought to storm into the building, police opened fire and killed a number of students, including <a href="Abdus%20Salam%20%28language%20martyr%29">Abdus Salam</a>, <a href="Rafiq%20Uddin%20Ahmed">Rafiq Uddin Ahmed</a>, <a href="Abul%20Barkat">Abul Barkat</a> and <a href="Abdul%20Jabbar%20%28activist%29">Abdul Jabbar</a>. As the news of the killings spread, disorder erupted across the city. Shops, offices and public transport were shut down and a general strike began. At the assembly, six legislators including <a href="Manoranjan%20Dhar">Manoranjan Dhar</a>, Boshontokumar Das, Shamsuddin Ahmed and <a href="Dhirendranath%20Datta">Dhirendranath Datta</a> requested that chief minister <a href="Nurul%20Amin">Nurul Amin</a> visit wounded students in hospital and that the assembly be adjourned as a sign of mourning. This motion was supported by some treasury bench members including <a href="Maulana%20Abdur%20Rashid%20Tarkabagish">Maulana Abdur Rashid Tarkabagish</a>, Shorfuddin Ahmed, Shamsuddin Ahmed Khondokar and Mosihuddin Ahmed. However, Nurul Amin refused the requests.

Disorder spread across the province as large processions ignored <a href="section%20144">section 144</a> and condemned the actions of the police. More than 30,000 people congregated at Curzon Hall in Dhaka. During the continued protests, police actions led to the death of four more people. This prompted officers and clerks from different organisations, including colleges, banks and the radio station, to boycott offices and join the procession. Protesters burned the offices of two leading pro-government news agencies, the "Jubilee Press" and the "Morning News". Police fired on a major "janaza", or mourning rally, as it was passing through <a href="Nawabpur%20Road">Nawabpur Road</a>. The shooting killed several people including activist <a href="Sofiur%20Rahman">Sofiur Rahman</a> and a nine-year-old boy named Ohiullah.

Through the night of 23 February, students of Dhaka Medical College worked on the construction of a "Shaheed Smritistombho", or Monument of Martyrs. Completed at dawn on 24 February, the monument had a handwritten note attached to it with the words ""Shaheed Smritistombho"". Inaugurated by the father of the slain activist Sofiur Rahman, the monument was destroyed on 26 February by police. On 25 February, industrial workers in the town of <a href="Narayanganj">Narayanganj</a> observed a general strike. A protest followed on 29 February whose participants faced severe police beating.

The government censored news reports and withheld exact casualty figures during the protests. Most pro-government media held <a href="Hindus">Hindus</a> and communists responsible for encouraging the disorder and student unrest. The families of Abul Barkat and Rafiq Uddin Ahmed tried to charge the police with murder, but the charges were dismissed by the police. On 8 April government report on the incidents failed to show any particular justification for police firings on the students. When the constituent assembly reconvened on 14 April, proceedings were stalled by members of the Muslim League when legislators from East Bengal sought to raise the language issue.

Although the Language Movement is considered to have laid the foundations for <a href="ethnic%20nationalism">ethnic nationalism</a> in many of the Bengalis of East Bengal and later East Pakistan, it also heightened the cultural animosity between the authorities of the two wings of Pakistan. In the western wing of the Dominion of Pakistan, the movement was seen as a sectional uprising against Pakistani national interests. The rejection of the "Urdu-only" policy was seen as a contravention of the <a href="Islamic%20culture">Perso-Arabic culture</a> of Muslims and the founding ideology of Pakistan, the <a href="two-nation%20theory">two-nation theory</a>. Some of the most powerful politicians from the <a href="Dominion%20of%20Pakistan%23Territory">western wing</a> of Pakistan considered Urdu a product of Indian Islamic culture, but saw Bengali as a part of "Hinduized" Bengali culture. Most stood by the "Urdu only" policy because they believed that only a single language, one that was not indigenous to Pakistan, should serve as the national language. This kind of thinking also provoked considerable opposition in the western wing, wherein there existed several linguistic groups. As late as in 1967, military dictator Ayub Khan said, "East Bengal is ... still under considerable Hindu culture and influence."

The "Shorbodolio Kendrio Rashtrobhasha Kormi Porishod", with support from the <a href="Bangladesh%20Awami%20League">Awami Muslim League</a>, decided to commemorate 21 February as "Shohid Dibosh" . On the first anniversary of the protests, people across East Bengal wore black badges in solidarity with the victims. Most offices, banks and educational institutions were closed to observe the occasion. Student groups made agreements with college and police officials to preserve law and order. More than 100,000 people assembled at a public meeting held in Dhaka, where community leaders called for the immediate release of Maulana Bhashani and other political prisoners. However, West Pakistani politicians such as Fazlur Rahman aggravated sectional tensions by declaring that anyone who wanted Bengali to become an official language would be considered an "enemy of the state". Bengali students and civilians disobeyed the restrictions to celebrate the anniversary of the protests. Demonstrations broke out on the night of 21 February 1954 with various halls of the University of Dhaka raising black flags in mourning.

Political tensions came to a head as elections to the provincial assembly of East Bengal were held in 1954. The ruling Muslim League denounced the opposition <a href="United%20Front%20%28East%20Pakistan%29">United Front</a> coalition, which—led by <a href="A.%20K.%20Fazlul%20Huq">A. K. Fazlul Huq</a> and the Awami League—wanted greater provincial autonomy. Several United Front leaders and activists were arrested. A meeting of parliament's Muslim League members, chaired by prime minister <a href="Muhammad%20Ali%20Bogra">Muhammad Ali Bogra</a>, resolved to give official recognition to Bengali. This decision was followed by a major wave of unrest as other ethnic groups sought recognition of other regional languages. Proponents of Urdu such as <a href="Maulvi%20Abdul%20Haq">Maulvi Abdul Haq</a> condemned any proposal to grant official status to Bengali. He led a rally of 100,000 people to protest against the Muslim League's decision. Consequently, the implementation failed and the United Front won a vast majority of seats in the legislative assembly, while the representation of the Muslim League was reduced to a historic low.

The United Front ministry ordered the creation of the <a href="Bangla%20Academy">Bangla Academy</a> to promote, develop, and preserve Bengali language, literature, and heritage. However, the United Front rule was temporary, as <a href="Governor%20General%20of%20Pakistan">Governor General</a> <a href="Malik%20Ghulam%20Muhammad">Ghulam Muhammad</a> cancelled the government and started Governor's rule on 30 May 1954. The United Front again formed the ministry on 6 June 1955 after the governor's regime ended. The Awami League did not participate in this ministry though.

Following the return of the United Front to power, the anniversary on 21 February 1956 was observed for the first time in a peaceful atmosphere. The Government supported a major project to construct a new Shaheed Minar. The session of the constituent assembly was stopped for five minutes to express condolence for the students slain in the police shootings. Major rallies were organised by Bengali leaders and all public offices and businesses remained closed.

On 7 May 1954, the constituent assembly resolved, with the Muslim League's support, to grant official status to Bengali. Bengali was recognised as the second official language of Pakistan on 29 February 1956, and article 214(1) of the constitution of Pakistan was reworded to "The state language of Pakistan shall be Urdu and Bengali."

However, the military government formed by <a href="Ayub%20Khan%20%28Field%20Marshal%29">Ayub Khan</a> made attempts to re-establish Urdu as the sole national language. On 6 January 1959, the military regime issued an official statement and reinstated the official stance of supporting the 1956 constitution's policy of two state languages.

Outside East Bengal, movement for equal status of Bengali also took place in the Indian state of <a href="Assam">Assam</a>. On 19 May 1961, 11 Bengalis were killed in police firing in <a href="Silchar">Silchar</a> Railway Station, Assam, while demanding state recognition of Bengali language. Subsequently, Bengali was given co-official status in the three Bengali-majority districts of Assam.

Although the question of official languages was settled by 1956, the military regime of Ayub Khan promoted the interests of <a href="West%20Pakistan">West Pakistan</a> at the expense of <a href="East%20Pakistan">East Pakistan</a>. Despite forming the majority of the national population, the East Pakistani population continued to be under-represented in the civil and military services, and received a minority of state funding and other government help. This was mainly due to lack of <a href="democracy">representative government</a> in the fledgling state. Mainly due to regional economic imbalances sectional divisions grew, and support for the Bengali ethnic nationalist Awami League, which invoked the <a href="Six%20point%20movement">6-point movement</a> for greater provincial autonomy. One demand was that East Pakistan be called "Bangladesh" (Land/Country of Bengal), which subsequently led to the Bangladesh Liberation War.

The Language Movement had a major cultural impact on Bengali society. It has inspired the development and celebration of the Bengali language, literature and culture. 21 February, celebrated as Language Movement Day or "Shohid Dibosh" (Martyrs' Day), is a major national holiday in Bangladesh. A month-long event called the <a href="Ekushey%20Book%20Fair">Ekushey Book Fair</a> is held every year to commemorate the movement. "<a href="Ekushey%20Padak">Ekushey Padak</a>", one of the highest civilian awards in Bangladesh, is awarded annually in memory of the sacrifices of the movement. Songs such as <a href="Abdul%20Gaffar%20Choudhury">Abdul Gaffar Choudhury</a>'s "<a href="Ekusher%20Gaan">Ekusher Gaan</a>", set to music by Shaheed <a href="Altaf%20Mahmud">Altaf Mahmud</a>, as well as plays, works of art and poetry played a considerable role in rousing the people's emotions during the movement. Since the events of February 1952, poems, songs, novels, plays, films, cartoons and paintings were created to capture the movement from varied point of views. Notable artistic depictions include the poems "Bornomala, Amar Dukhini Bornomala" and "February 1969" by <a href="Shamsur%20Rahman%20%28poet%29">Shamsur Rahman</a>, the film "<a href="Jibon%20Theke%20Neya">Jibon Theke Neya</a>" by <a href="Zahir%20Raihan">Zahir Raihan</a>, the stage play "Kobor" by <a href="Munier%20Chowdhury">Munier Chowdhury</a> and the novels "Ekushey February" by Raihan and "Artonaad" by <a href="Shawkat%20Osman">Shawkat Osman</a>.

Two years after the first monument was destroyed by the police, a new "<a href="Shaheed%20Minar%2C%20Dhaka">Shaheed Minar</a>" (Monument of Martyrs) was constructed in 1954 to commemorate the protesters who lost their lives. Work on a larger monument designed by the architect <a href="Hamidur%20Rahman%20%28artist%29">Hamidur Rahman</a> began in 1957 with the support of the United Front ministry. Hamidur Rahman's model consisted of a large complex in the yard of the Dhaka Medical College Hostel. The design included a half-circular column symbolizing a mother with her martyred sons standing at the dais in the centre of the monument. Although the imposition of martial law in 1958 interrupted the work, the monument was completed and inaugurated on 21 February 1963 by <a href="Abul%20Barkat">Abul Barkat</a>'s mother, Hasina Begum. Pakistani forces demolished the monument during the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, but the Bangladeshi government reconstructed it in 1973. <a href="Ekushey%20Television">Ekushey Television</a>, the first private terrestrial TV channel of Bangladesh was named after the Event of 21 February.

The states of <a href="West%20Bengal">West Bengal</a> and <a href="Tripura">Tripura</a> in <a href="India">India</a> also follow and celebrate the Day by paying tribute to the unsung heroes. Moreover, all the bengalees in India and abroad celebrate the Day for the sacrifice of lives just for the sake of the <a href="First%20language">First language</a>.

Bangladesh officially sent a proposal to UNESCO to declare 21 February as <a href="International%20Mother%20Language%20Day">International Mother Language Day</a>. The proposal was supported unanimously at the 30th General Conference of UNESCO held on 17 November 1999.

Geology of the Death Valley area

The exposed geology of the Death Valley area presents a diverse and complex set of at least 23 <a href="Formation%20%28stratigraphy%29">formation</a>s of sedimentary units, two major gaps in the geologic record called <a href="unconformity%20%28geology%29">unconformities</a>, and at least one distinct set of related formations geologists call a <a href="group%20%28geology%29">group</a>. The oldest rocks in the area that now includes <a href="Death%20Valley%20National%20Park">Death Valley National Park</a> are extensively <a href="Metamorphism%20%28geology%29">metamorphosed</a> by intense heat and pressure and are at least <a href="Mesoproterozoic">1700 million years</a> old. These rocks were intruded by a mass of granite 1400 <a href="Year%23Abbreviations%20yr%20and%20ya">Ma</a> (million years ago) and later uplifted and exposed to nearly 500 million years of erosion.

Marine deposition occurred <a href="neoproterozoic">1200 to 800 Ma</a>, creating thick sequences of <a href="conglomerate%20%28geology%29">conglomerate</a>, <a href="mudstone">mudstone</a>, and <a href="carbonate%20rock">carbonate rock</a> topped by <a href="stromatolite">stromatolite</a>s, and possibly glacial deposits from the hypothesized <a href="Snowball%20Earth">Snowball Earth</a> event. <a href="Rift">Rift</a>ing thinned huge roughly linear parts of the supercontinent <a href="Rodinia">Rodinia</a> enough to allow sea water to invade and divide its landmass into component continents separated by narrow straits. A <a href="passive%20margin">passive margin</a> developed on the edges of these new seas in the Death Valley region. Carbonate banks formed on this part of the two <a href="plate%20tectonics">margins</a> only to be subsided as the <a href="continental%20crust">continental crust</a> thinned until it broke, giving birth to a new ocean basin. An <a href="Accretion%20%28geology%29">accretion</a> wedge of <a href="clastic">clastic</a> sediment then started to accumulate at the base of the submerged precipice, entombing the region's first known fossils of complex life. These sandy <a href="mudflats">mudflats</a> gave way about <a href="ediacaran">550 Ma</a> to a <a href="carbonate%20platform">carbonate platform</a> which lasted for the next 300 million years of <a href="Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> time.

The passive margin switched to <a href="active%20margin">active margin</a> in the early-to-mid <a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> when the <a href="Farallon%20Plate">Farallon Plate</a> under the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> started to dive below the <a href="North%20American%20Plate">North American Plate</a>, creating a <a href="subduction%20zone">subduction zone</a>; <a href="volcano">volcano</a>es and uplifting mountains were created as a result. Erosion over many millions of years created a relatively featureless plain. Stretching of the crust under western North America started around <a href="miocene">16 Ma</a> and is thought to be caused by upwelling from the subducted <a href="divergent%20boundary">spreading-zone</a> of the Farallon Plate. This process continues into the present and is thought to be responsible for creating the <a href="Basin%20and%20Range%20province">Basin and Range province</a>. By <a href="pliocene">2 to 3 million years ago</a> this province had spread to the Death Valley area, ripping it apart and creating <a href="Death%20Valley">Death Valley</a>, <a href="Panamint%20Valley">Panamint Valley</a> and surrounding ranges. These valleys partially filled with sediment and, during colder periods during the current <a href="ice%20age">ice age</a>, with lakes. <a href="Lake%20Manly">Lake Manly</a> was the largest of these lakes; it filled Death Valley during each <a href="glacial%20period">glacial period</a> from 240,000 years ago to 10,000 years ago. By <a href="holocene">10,500 years ago</a> these lakes were increasingly cut off from glacial melt from the <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20%28U.S.%29">Sierra Nevada</a>, starving them of water and concentrating salts and minerals. The desert environment seen today developed after these lakes dried up.

Little is known about the history of the oldest exposed rocks in the area due to extensive <a href="Metamorphic%20rock">metamorphism</a>; the rock has been pressure-cooked. This somber, gray, almost featureless crystalline complex is composed of originally <a href="sedimentary%20rock">sedimentary</a> and <a href="igneous%20rock">igneous rock</a>s with large quantities of <a href="quartz">quartz</a> and <a href="feldspar">feldspar</a> mixed in. The original rocks were transformed to contorted <a href="schist">schist</a> and <a href="gneiss">gneiss</a>, making their original parentage almost unrecognizable. <a href="Radiometric%20dating">Radiometric dating</a> gives an age of 1700 million years for the metamorphism, placing it in the early part of the <a href="Proterozoic">Proterozoic</a> eon.

A mass of <a href="granite">granite</a> now in the Panamint Mountains intruded this complex 1400 mya. <a href="Pegmatite">Pegmatic</a> <a href="Dike%20%28geology%29">dike</a>s and other widely spaced <a href="Intrusion">pluton</a>s of granite are also in the complex (a pluton is a large blob of <a href="magma">magma</a> deep underground and dikes are projections of that). Outcrops can be seen along the front of the Black Mountains in Death Valley and in the Talc and Ibex Hills. When the granite was being intruded, the west coast of North America ran through <a href="Eastern%20California">Eastern California</a> and through an embayment that spread toward the <a href="Las%20Vegas%20Valley">Las Vegas Valley</a>. This embayment, called the Amargosa <a href="aulacogen">aulacogen</a>, had highlands north and south of it and was the result of a <a href="failed%20rift">failed rift</a>. Many thousands of feet of sediment filled the slowly subsiding basin.

Next, the metamorphosed Precambrian basement rocks were uplifted and a nearly 500-million-year-long gap in the geologic record, a major <a href="unconformity">unconformity</a>, affected the region. Geologists do not know what happened to the eroded sediment that must have overlain the complex, but they do know that regional uplift was responsible; the area was originally below the surface of a shallow sea.

The <a href="Pahrump%20Group">Pahrump Group</a> of formations were deposited from 1200 to 800 mya in the Amargosa aulacogen. This was after uplift-associated erosion removed whatever rocks covered the Proteozoic Complex. Pahrump is composed of, from oldest to youngest:
Outcrops of this group can be seen in a highly metamorphosed belt that extends from the Panamint Mountains to the eastern part of the Kingston Range, including an area near the Ashford Mill site.

Uplift eventually exposed the crystalline complex to erosion. Arkose conglomerate and mudstone of the lower Crystal Spring Formation were created from muddy debris derived from stream erosion of these uplands. A warm shallow sea spread over the area as the Amargosa aulacogen slowly subsided; thick sequences of <a href="Lime%20%28mineral%29">lime</a>-rich ooze with abundant colonies of algae called <a href="stromatolite">stromatolite</a>s were then laid down. <a href="Dolomite">Dolomite</a> and <a href="limestone">limestone</a> resulted, forming the middle part of the Crystal Spring Formation. The upper part was formed after silt and sand destroyed the <a href="algal%20mat">algal mat</a>, forming <a href="siltstone">siltstone</a> and <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>. Laterally extensive <a href="diabase">diabase</a> <a href="Sill%20%28geology%29">sill</a>s of molten rock later intruded above and below the carbonate rock layers; commercial grade <a href="talc">talc</a> was formed from thermal decay of carbonate rock at its contact with the lowest sill, which covers hundreds of square miles (many hundreds of km²). Today the formation is thick.

The Death Valley region once again rose above sea level, resulting in erosion. The Amargosa aulacogen then slowly sank beneath the seas; a sequence of carbonate banks that were topped by algal mats of stromatolites were laid on top of its eroded surface. Eventually these sediments and fossils became the Beck Spring Formation, which is thick.

Another round of uplift exposed the Beck Spring rocks and the underlying Crystal Spring to erosion; subsequent faster subsidence of the Amargosa aulacogen broke these formations into islands in later Proterozoic time. The resulting large sequence of thick conglomerate beds of pebbles and boulders in a sandy and muddy matrix that blanketed <a href="sedimentary%20basin">basin</a>s between higher areas is known as the Kingston Peak Formation. This formation is prominent near Wildrose, Harrisburg Flats, and Butte Valley and is thick.

Part of the Kingston Peak resembles <a href="glacial%20till">glacial till</a> by being poorly sorted and other parts have large boulder-sized dropstones resting in a fine-grained matrix of sandstone and siltstone. Similar deposits are found over North America during the same period, some 700 to 800 mya. Geologists therefore hypothesize that the world at that time was affected by a very severe <a href="glaciation">glaciation</a>, perhaps the most severe in geologic history (see <a href="Snowball%20Earth">Snowball Earth</a>). The youngest rocks in the Pahrump Group are from <a href="basalt">basalt</a>ic lava flows.

A new rift opened that started to break apart the <a href="supercontinent">supercontinent</a> <a href="Rodinia">Rodinia</a>, which North America was then a part of. A shoreline similar to the present <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> margin of the United States, with coastal lowlands and a wide, shallow shelf but no <a href="volcano">volcano</a>es, lay to the east near where Las Vegas now resides.

The first formation to be deposited in this setting was the Noonday Dolomite, which was formed from an algal mat-covered carbonate bank. Today it is up to thick and is a pale yellowish-gray cliff-former. The area subsided as the continental crust thinned and the new ocean widened; the carbonate bank soon became covered by thin beds of silt and layers of lime-rich ooze. These sediments in time hardened to become the siltstone and limestone of the Ibex Formation. A good outcrop of both the Noonday and overlying Ibex formations can be seen just east of the Ashford Mill Site.

An <a href="angular%20unconformity">angular unconformity</a> truncates progressively older (lower) parts of the underlying Pahrump Group starting in the southern part of the area and moving north. At its northernmost extent, the unconformity in fact removed all of the Pahrump, and the Noonday rests directly on the Proterozoic Complex. An ancient period of erosion removed that part of the Pahrump due to its being higher (and thus more exposed) than the rest of the formation.

As the incipient ocean widened in the Late Proterozoic and Early Paleozoic, it broke the continental crust in two and a true <a href="ocean%20basin">ocean basin</a> developed to the west. All the earlier formations were thus dissected along a steep front on the two halves of the previous continent. A wedge of clastic sediment then started to accumulate at the base of the two underwater precipices, starting the formation of opposing <a href="continental%20shelf">continental shelves</a>.

Three formations developed from sediment that accumulated on the wedge. They are, from oldest to youngest:
Together the Stirling, Wood Canyon, and Zabriskie units are about thick and are made of well-cemented sandstones and conglomerates. They also contain the region's first known fossils of complex life: <a href="Ediacaran">Ediacara fauna</a>, <a href="trilobite">trilobite</a>s, <a href="archaeocyatha">archaeocyatha</a>s, and primitive <a href="echinoderm">echinoderm</a> burrows have been found in the Wood Canyon Formation. The very earliest animals are exceedingly rare, occurring well west of Death Valley in lime-rich offshore muds contemporary to the Stirling Quartzite. Good outcrops of these formations are exposed on the north face of Tucki Mountain in the northern Panamint Mountains.

The side road to Aguereberry Point successively traverses the shaly Johnnie Formation, the white Stirling Quartzite, and dark quartzites of the Wood Canyon Formation; at the Point itself is the great light-colored band of Zabriskie Quartzite dipping away toward Death Valley. Prominent outcrops are located between Death Valley Buttes and Daylight Pass, in upper Echo Canyon, and just west of Mare Spring in Titus Canyon. Before tilting to their present orientation, these four formations were a continuous pile of mud and sand deep that accumulated slowly on the nearshore ocean bottom.

A carbonate shelf started to develop over the sandy mudflats early in <a href="Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> time. Sediment accumulated on the new but slowly subsiding continental shelf all through the Paleozoic and into the Early <a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a>. Erosion had so subdued nearby parts of the continent that rivers ran clear, no longer supplying abundant sand and silt to the continental shelf. At the time, the Death Valley area was within ten or twenty degrees of the Paleozoic equator. So the combination of a warm sunlit climate and clear mud-free waters promoted prolific production of <a href="biotic%20material">biotic</a> (from life) carbonates. Thick beds of carbonate-rich sediments were periodically interrupted by periods of emergence, creating the (in order of deposition);
These sediments were <a href="lithification">lithified</a> into limestone and dolomite after they were buried and compacted by yet more sediment. Thickest of these units is the dolomitic Bonanza King Formation, which forms the dark and light banded lower slopes of Pyramid Peak and the gorges of Titus and Grotto Canyons.

An intervening period occurred in the Mid <a href="Ordovician">Ordovician</a> (about 450 Ma) when a sheet of <a href="quartz">quartz</a>-rich sand blanketed a large part of the continent after the above-mentioned units were laid down. The sand later hardened into sandstone and later still metamorphosed into the thick Eureka Quartzite. This great white band of Ordovician rock stands out on the summit of Pyramid Peak, near the Racetrack, and high on the east shoulder of Tucki Mountain. No American source is known for the Eureka sand, which once blanketed a belt from <a href="California">California</a> to <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>. It may have been swept southward by <a href="longshore%20current">longshore current</a>s from an eroding sandstone terrain in Canada.

Deposition of carbonate sediments resumed and continued into the <a href="Triassic">Triassic</a>. Four formations were deposited during this time (from oldest to youngest);
The other period of interruption occurred between 350 and 250 Ma when sporadic pulses of mud swept southward into the Death Valley region during the erosion of highlands in north-central <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a>.

Although details of geography varied during this immense interval of time, a north-northeasterly trending coastline generally ran from <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a> up through <a href="Utah">Utah</a>. A marine carbonate platform only tens of feet deep but more than wide stretched westward to a fringing rim of offshore <a href="reef">reef</a>s. Lime-rich mud and sand eroded by storm waves from the reefs and the platform collected on the quieter ocean floor at depths of or so. The Death Valley area's carbonates appear to represent all three environments (down-slope basin, reef, and back-reef platform) owing to movement through time of the reef-line itself.

All told these eight formations and one group are thick and are buried below much of the Cottonwood, Funeral, Grapevine, and Panamint ranges. Good outcrops can be seen in the southern Funeral Mountains outside the park and in Butte Valley within park borders. The Eureka Quartzite appears as a relatively thin, nearly white band with the grayish Pogonip Group below and the almost black Ely Springs Dolomite above. All <a href="Stratum">strata</a> are often vertically displaced by normal <a href="fault%20%28geology%29">faulting</a>.

The western edge of the North American continent was later pushed against the oceanic plate under the adjacent ocean. An area of great compression called a <a href="subduction%20zone">subduction zone</a> was formed in the early-to-mid Mesozoic, which replaced the quiet, sea-covered continental margin with erupting volcanoes and uplifting mountains. A chain of volcanoes pushed through the continental crust parallel to the deep <a href="Oceanic%20trench">trench</a>, fed by magma rising from the subducting oceanic plate as it entered the Earth's hot interior. Thousands of feet (hundreds of meters) of lavas erupted, pushing the ocean over to the west.

Compressive forces built up along the entire length of the broad continental shelf. The <a href="Sierran%20Arc">Sierran Arc</a>, also called the Cordilleran Mesozoic <a href="magmatic%20arc">magmatic arc</a>, started to form from heat and pressure generated from the subduction. Compressive forces caused <a href="thrust%20fault">thrust fault</a>s to develop and granitic blobs of magma called <a href="pluton">pluton</a>s to rise in the Death Valley region and beyond, most notably creating the <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20Batholith">Sierra Nevada Batholith</a> to the west. Thrust faulting was so severe that the continental shelf was shortened and some parts of older formations were moved on top of younger rock units.
The plutons in the park are <a href="Jurassic">Jurassic</a> and <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> aged and are located toward the park's western margin where they can be seen from unimproved roads. One of these relatively small granitic plutons was emplaced 67–87 Ma and spawned one of the more profitable <a href="precious%20metal">precious metal</a> deposits in the Death Valley area, giving rise to the town and mines of <a href="Skidoo%2C%20California">Skidoo</a>. In the Death Valley area these solidified blobs of magma are located under much of the <a href="Owlshead%20Mountains">Owlshead Mountains</a> and are found in the western end of the Panamint Mountains. Thrusted areas can be seen at Schwaub Peak in the southern part of the Funeral Mountains.

A long period of uplift and erosion was concurrent with and followed the above events, creating a major unconformity. Sediments worn off the Death Valley region were shed both east and west and carried by wind and water; the eastern sediments ended up in <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a> and are now famous for their <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> fossils. No Jurassic to <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> sedimentary formations exist in the area except for some possibly Jurassic-age <a href="volcanic%20rock">volcanic rock</a> around Butte Valley. Large parts of previously deposited formations were removed; probably by streams that washed the sediment into the <a href="Cretaceous%20Seaway">Cretaceous Seaway</a> that longitudinally divided North America to the east.

After 150 million years of volcanism, plutonism, metamorphism, and thrust faulting had run their course, the early part of the Cenozoic era (early Tertiary, 65–30 Ma) was a time of repose; neither igneous nor sedimentary rocks of this age are known here. A relatively featureless <a href="plain%20%28landform%29">plain</a> was created from erosion over many millions of years. Deposition resumed some 35 Ma in the <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> epoch on a <a href="flood%20plain">flood plain</a> that developed in the area; sluggish streams migrated laterally over the surface, laying down cobbles, sand, and mud. Outcrops of the resulting <a href="conglomerate%20%28geology%29">conglomerates</a>, sandstone, and mudstone of the Titus Canyon Formation can be observed in road cuts at Daylight Pass on Daylight Pass Road, which becomes <a href="Nevada%20State%20Route%20374">State Route 374</a> a short distance from the pass. Several other similar formations were also laid down.

Large volcanic eruptions, originating near the <a href="Nevada%20Test%20Site">Nevada Test Site</a>, covered the Death Valley area and much of Nevada in thick sequences of silica-rich ash 27 million years ago. The ash has a <a href="rhyolite">rhyolitic</a> composition, which is the volcanic equivalent of the <a href="plutonic%20rock">plutonic rock</a> granite; it covered what would later become the Grapevine Mountains in of ash. This ash filled in valleys and depressions; by 20 million years ago, the region from the Death Valley area across Nevada was a volcanic plain.

Starting around 16 Ma in <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> time and continuing into the present, a large part of the <a href="North%20American%20Plate">North American Plate</a> in the region has been under extension by literally being pulled apart. Debate still surrounds the cause of this crustal stretching, but an increasingly popular idea among geologists called the <a href="slab%20gap%20hypothesis">slab gap hypothesis</a> states that the spreading zone of the subducted <a href="Farallon%20Plate">Farallon Plate</a> is pushing the continent apart. Whatever the cause, the result has been the creation of a large and still-growing region of relatively thin crust; the region grew an average of per year initially and then slowed to per year in the last 5 million years. Geologists call this region the <a href="Basin%20and%20Range%20Province">Basin and Range Province</a>.

Extensional forces causes rock at depth to stretch like <a href="silly%20putty">silly putty</a> and rock closer to the surface to break along normal faults into downfallen basins called <a href="graben">graben</a>s; small mountain ranges known as <a href="Horst%20%28geology%29">horst</a>s run parallel to each other on either side of the graben. Normally the number of horsts and grabens is limited, but in the Basin and Range region there are dozens of horst/graben structures, each roughly north-south trending. A succession of these extend from immediately east of the <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20%28U.S.%29">Sierra Nevada</a>, through almost all of Nevada, and into western Utah and southern <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a>. The crust in the Death Valley region between <a href="Lake%20Mead">Lake Mead</a> and the southern Sierra Nevada has been extended by as much as .
The Furnace Creek Fault system, located in what is now the northern part of Death Valley, started to move about 14 Ma and the Southern Death Valley Fault system likely began to move by 12 million years ago. Both fault systems move with a right-lateral offset along <a href="strike-slip%20fault">strike-slip fault</a>s; these type of faults rub past each other so that a theoretical observer standing on one side facing the other side sees it move right. Both fault systems run parallel to and at the base of the ranges. Very often the same faults move laterally and vertically, simultaneously making them strike-slip "and" normal (i.e. oblique-slip). These two systems are also offset from each other; the area between the offset is thus put under enormous oblique tension, which intensifies subsidence there; Furnace Creek Basin opened in this area and the rest of Death Valley followed in stages. One of the last stages was the formation of <a href="Badwater%20Basin">Badwater Basin</a>, which occurred by about 4 Ma. Data from <a href="gravimeter">gravimeter</a>s show that Death Valley's bedrock floor tilts down toward the east and is deepest under Badwater Basin; there is of fill under Badwater. By about 2 Ma <a href="Death%20Valley">Death Valley</a>, <a href="Panamint%20Valley">Panamint Valley</a> and their associated ranges were formed.

Much of the extra local stretching in Death Valley that is responsible for its lower depth and wider valley floor is caused by "left" lateral strike-slip movement along the Garlock Fault south of the park (the Garlock Fault separates the Sierra Nevada range from the <a href="Mojave%20Desert">Mojave Desert</a>). This particular fault is pulling the Panamint Range westward, causing the Death Valley graben to slip downward along the Furnace Creek Fault system at the foot of the <a href="Black%20Mountains%20%28California%29">Black Mountains</a>. The rocks that would become the Panamint Range may have been stacked on top of the rocks that would become the Black Mountains and the <a href="Cottonwood%20Mountains%20%28Inyo%20County%29">Cottonwood Mountains</a>. Under this interpretation, as the Black Mountains began to rise, the Panamint/Cottonwood Mountains slid westward off of them along low-angle normal faults, and starting around 6 Ma, the Cottonwood Mountains slid northwest off the top of the Panamint Range. There is also some evidence that the Grapevine Mountains may have slid off the Funeral Mountains. Another interpretation of the evidence is that the Black and Panamint Mountains were once side-by-side and were pulled apart along normal faults. These normal faults, in this view, are steep near the surface but become low angle at depth; the mountain blocks rotated as they slid to create the tilted mountains seen today.

Total movement of the Pamamint block between the Garlock and Furnace Creek Faults is to the northwest, creating Death Valley in the process. A few of the 20 to 25 degree-sloped surfaces along which this mass of of rock slipped, are exposed in Death Valley. These features are called "turtlebacks" due to their turtle shell-like appearance.

Igneous activity associated with the extension occurred from 12 to 4 Ma. Both intrusive (plutonic/solidified underground) and extrusive (volcanic/solidified above ground) igneous rocks were created. Basaltic magma followed fault lines to the surface and erupted as <a href="cinder%20cone">cinder cone</a>s and lava flows. Some volcanic rocks were re-worked by hydrothermal systems to form colorful rocks and concentrated mineral formations, such as <a href="boron">boron</a>-rich minerals like <a href="borax">borax</a>; a <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a>-aged example is the -thick Artist Drive Formation. Gold and silver ores were also concentrated by mineralizing fluids from igneous intrusions. Other times, heat from magma migrating close to the surface would superheat overlaying <a href="groundwater">groundwater</a> until it exploded, not unlike an exploding pressure-cooker, creating blowout craters and <a href="tuff%20ring">tuff ring</a>s. One example of such a feature is the roughly 2000-year-old and deep <a href="Ubehebe%20Crater">Ubehebe Crater</a> () in the northern part of the park; nearby smaller craters may be less than 200 to 300 years old.

Sediment filled the subsiding Furnace Creek Basin as the area was pulled apart by Basin and Range extension. The resulting -thick Furnace Creek Formation is made of lakebed sediments that consist of saline muds, gravels from nearby mountains and ash from the then-active Black Mountain volcanic field. Boron, which is abundant in this formation, is dissolved by ground water and flows out onto the northern end of the Death Valley playa. Today this formation is most-prominently exposed in the <a href="badlands">badlands</a> at <a href="Zabriskie%20Point">Zabriskie Point</a>. Additional subsidence of the Furnace Creek Basin was filled by the four-million-year-old Funeral Formation, which consists of of conglomerates, sand, mud and volcanic material. Another smaller basin to the south was filled by the Copper Canyon Formation around the same time. Footprints and fossils of camels, horses, and mammoths are in all three of these Pliocene formations.

About 2–3 Ma, in the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>, continental ice sheets expanded from the polar regions of the globe to cover lower latitudes far north of the region, starting a series of cold <a href="glacial%20period">glacial period</a>s that were interrupted by warmer <a href="interglacial%20period">interglacial period</a>s. Snowmelt from alpine <a href="glacier">glacier</a>s on the nearby Sierra Nevada during glacial periods fed rivers that flowed into the valleys of the region year round. Since the topography of the Basin and Range region was largely formed by faulting, not by river erosion, many of the basins have no outlets, meaning they will fill up with water like a bathtub until they overflow into the next basin. So during the cooler and wetter pluvial climates of the glacial periods, much of <a href="eastern%20California">eastern California</a>, all of Nevada, and western Utah were covered by large lakes separated by linear islands (the present day ranges).
<a href="Lake%20Manly">Lake Manly</a> was the lake that filled Death Valley during each glacial period from at least 240,000 years ago to as late as 10,500 years ago; the lake typically dried up during each interglacial period, such as the current one. Lake Manly was the last in a chain of lakes that were fed by the <a href="Amargosa%20River">Amargosa</a> and <a href="Mojave%20River">Mojave River</a>s, and possibly also the <a href="Owens%20River">Owens River</a>; it was also the lowest point in the <a href="Great%20Basin">Great Basin</a> drainage system. At its height during the <a href="Last%20glacial%20period">Last glacial period</a> some 22,000 years ago, water filled Lake Manly to form a body of water that may have been deep and long. Much smaller lakes filled parts of Death Valley during interglacials; the largest of these was deep and lasted from 5000 to 2000 years ago. Panamint Lake filled Panamint Valley to a maximum depth of ; when it was full, Panamint Lake overflowed into Lake Manly somewhere around the southern end of the Panamint Mountains.

Lake Manly and its sister lakes started to dry up about 10,000 years ago as the alpine glaciers that fed the rivers that filled the lakes disappeared and the region became increasingly arid. Fish that had migrated into the lake system from the <a href="Colorado%20River">Colorado River</a> started to die off; the only survivors are the minnow-sized <a href="Death%20Valley%20pupfish">Death Valley pupfish</a> and related species that adapted to living in springs. Ancient weak shorelines called strandlines from Lake Manly can easily be seen on a former island in the lake called Shoreline Butte.

<a href="Stream%20gradient">Stream gradient</a>s increased on flanking mountain ranges as they were uplifted. These swifter moving streams are dry most of the year but have nevertheless cut true river valleys, canyons, and gorges that face Death and Panamint valleys. In this arid environment, <a href="alluvial%20fan">alluvial fan</a>s form at the mouth of these streams. Very large alluvial fans merged to form continuous alluvial slopes called "bajadas" along the Panamint Range. The faster uplift along the Black Mountains formed much smaller alluvial fans because older fans are buried under playa sediments before they can grow too large. <a href="Slot%20canyon">Slot canyon</a>s are often found at the mouths of the streams that feed the fans, and the slot canyons in turn are topped by V-shaped gorges. This forms what looks like a <a href="wineglass">wineglass</a> shape to some people, thus giving them their names, "wineglass canyons".

This table of formations exposed in the Death Valley area lists and describes the exposed <a href="formation%20%28geology%29">formation</a>s of the <a href="Death%20Valley%20National%20Park">Death Valley National Park</a> and the surrounding area.

Operation Copperhead

Operation Copperhead was a small <a href="military%20deception">military deception</a> operation run by the British during the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>. It formed part of <a href="Operation%20Bodyguard">Operation Bodyguard</a>, the cover plan for the <a href="invasion%20of%20Normandy">invasion of Normandy</a> in 1944, and was intended to mislead German intelligence as to the location of General <a href="Bernard%20Montgomery">Bernard Montgomery</a>. The operation was conceived by <a href="Dudley%20Clarke">Dudley Clarke</a> in early 1944 after he watched the film "<a href="Five%20Graves%20to%20Cairo">Five Graves to Cairo</a>". Following the war <a href="M.%20E.%20Clifton%20James">M. E. Clifton James</a> wrote a book about the operation, "<a href="I%20Was%20Monty%27s%20Double">I Was Monty's Double</a>". It was later adapted into a film, with James in the lead role.

The German high command expected Montgomery (one of the best-known Allied commanders) to play a key role in any cross-channel bridgehead. Clarke and the other deception planners reasoned that a high-profile appearance outside the United Kingdom would suggest that an Allied invasion was not imminent. An appropriate look-alike was found, <a href="M.%20E.%20Clifton%20James">M. E. Clifton James</a>, who spent a short time with Montgomery to familiarise himself with the general's mannerisms. On 26 May 1944, James flew first to Gibraltar and then to Algiers, making appearances where the Allies knew German intelligence agents would spot him. He then flew secretly to Cairo and remained in hiding until Montgomery's public appearance in Normandy following the invasion.

The operation did not appear to have any significant impact on German plans and was not reported high up the <a href="command%20hierarchy">chain of command</a>. It was executed some time before D-Day, and in the midst of several other Allied deceptions. German intelligence might have suspected a trick, or not attributed much importance to the visit.

In preparation for the 1944 <a href="invasion%20of%20Normandy">invasion of Normandy</a>, the Allied nations conducted a complex series of deceptions under the codename <a href="Operation%20Bodyguard">Bodyguard</a>. The overall aim of the plan was to confuse the German high command as to the exact location and timing of the invasion. Significant time was spent constructing the <a href="First%20United%20States%20Army%20Group">First United States Army Group</a>, a notional army to threaten <a href="Pas%20de%20Calais">Pas de Calais</a>, along with political and visual deceptions to communicate a fictional Allied battle plan. Copperhead was a small portion of Bodyguard conceived by <a href="Dudley%20Clarke">Dudley Clarke</a>. Earlier in the war Clarke had pioneered the idea of strategic deception, forming a deception department in <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a> named <a href="Advanced%20Headquarters%20%27A%27%20Force">'A' Force</a>. Clarke and 'A' Force were not officially in charge of Bodyguard planning (a role that fell to the <a href="London%20Controlling%20Section">London Controlling Section</a>), but because of the location of the deception the Cairo planners organised much of the operation.

On a visit to Naples in January 1944 Clarke had seen the film "<a href="Five%20Graves%20to%20Cairo">Five Graves to Cairo</a>", in which actor <a href="Miles%20Mander">Miles Mander</a> makes a brief appearance as Bernard Montgomery. The film involves one character impersonating another and Clarke suggested attempting the same trick in real life. He proposed an operation to mislead German commanders as to Montgomery's location in the days immediately before the Normandy landings (codenamed <a href="Operation%20Neptune">Operation Neptune</a>).

Montgomery was one of the most prominent Allied commanders and the German high command expected him to be present for any invasion of France. Clarke hoped Montgomery's apparent presence in <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> and Africa would lend support to the idea that the Allies might be planning landings in southern France, as part of <a href="Operation%20Bodyguard%23List_of_operations">Operation Vendetta</a>, rather than across the Channel. While in London, in February 1944, Clarke, the London Controlling Section and <a href="Ops%20%28B%29">Ops (B)</a> drafted Copperhead in support of Vendetta.

Mander, the actor from "Five Graves to Cairo", was located in <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> but found to be too tall in real life. Another look-alike was identified but before he could be drafted into the operation he broke a leg in a motorbike accident. Eventually, Lieutenant-Colonel <a href="List%20of%20Ops%20%28B%29%20staff%23John%20Jervis-Read">J. V. B. Jervis-Reid</a>, head of Ops (B), spotted a photograph of Meyrick Clifton James in the "<a href="News%20Chronicle">News Chronicle</a>". James, an Australian, had spent 25 years as an actor before the war, and at the time was assigned to the <a href="Royal%20Army%20Pay%20Corps">Royal Army Pay Corps</a>. Colonel <a href="David%20Niven">David Niven</a>, a well-known British actor, was asked to contact James and offer him a <a href="screen%20test">screen test</a> for future army films. When he arrived at the meeting, James was told his true role.

James was not a perfect stand-in for Montgomery. He had lost a finger during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, so a prosthetic had to be made. He had also never flown before, so the London Controlling Section's <a href="Dennis%20Wheatley">Dennis Wheatley</a> took James up for a test flight to make sure he did not suffer from air sickness. Finally, James both drank heavily and smoked cigars, while Montgomery was a <a href="teetotaler">teetotaler</a> and disliked smoking. The deception planners were worried that James might be spotted drinking, spoiling the performance. Despite these hitches, and with Montgomery's approval, the plan went forward. To get into character, James spent some time with the general, posing as a journalist, to study his mannerisms.

Allied deceivers used their <a href="Double-Cross%20System">double agent network</a> to circulate the idea that Montgomery would command ground forces during the invasion. Then, on 26 May 1944, James flew overnight from <a href="RAF%20Northolt">RAF Northolt</a> to <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, where the Germans maintained an observation post overlooking the airport from across the Spanish border. The plane had to circle for an hour before landing to allow James, who had smuggled a bottle of gin onto the flight, to sober up. He then attended breakfast with the British governor, Sir <a href="Ralph%20Eastwood">Ralph Eastwood</a>, before departing again for the airfield. The Allies had arranged for Ignacio Molina Pérez, a Spanish envoy known to be a German spy, to visit Government House. After observing James's departure, Pérez hurriedly crossed the border to place a call to his German handler.

James then flew to <a href="Algiers">Algiers</a>, where he was publicly paraded through the airport and driven to meet General <a href="Henry%20Maitland%20Wilson%2C%201st%20Baron%20Wilson">Maitland Wilson</a>, ostensibly for a meeting to discuss operations against the south of France. Instead, he was moved quietly to a remote villa by 'A' Force's Rex Hamer. Rumours suggest this was because James had been spotted smoking and staggering around Algiers, so the deceivers decided to cut his appearances short. Whatever the reason, the next day, out of character, James was flown to Cairo. He was to remain hidden there until the public disclosure of Montgomery's presence in France. Meanwhile, double agents in North Africa were used to extend the masquerade for a few more days, by hinting Montgomery was still in the region.

The impact of Copperhead is unclear. The visit was reported up the German chain of command, and some double agents later received requests for information about Montgomery's movements. There is no indication that Montgomery's appearance affected German views of the imminent invasion threat. Writing in 2011, historian Joshua Levine attributes this to the fact that the deception was carried out ten days before D-Day, arguing that there would be no reason for a flying visit to North Africa to preclude an imminent invasion.

Another factor was that, in early May 1944, an uncontrolled agent based in Spain (who sold fictional intelligence to the Germans) had passed on details of a meeting in Gibraltar between several high-ranking Allied officers. Documents found after the war indicate that the Germans found this information suspect, and may have treated Montgomery's appearance as equally so. Although double agents received several urgent requests from the <a href="Abwehr">Abwehr</a> about his whereabouts it does not appear that this information was passed on to the German command in France. According to captured enemy generals, German intelligence believed that it was Montgomery, though they still guessed that it was a feint. The Bodyguard deception had confused the German command as to Allied intentions and the apparent arrival of Montgomery in Gibraltar added little to the picture.

James did not enjoy the experience. Although he received equivalent pay (£10 per day) to Montgomery during the operation, it had been a stressful assignment. Following Montgomery's public appearance on the Normandy beachhead, James flew back to England and resumed his role within the Pay Corps and was warned not to discuss the operation. <a href="Dennis%20Wheatley">Dennis Wheatley</a>, in his memoirs, commented that he felt James had been treated "shabbily" for his efforts.

In 1954 James wrote an account of the operation, entitled "<a href="I%20Was%20Monty%27s%20Double">I Was Monty's Double</a>" (published in the United States as "The Counterfeit General"). The British government made no attempt to stop publication, and in 1958 the book was adapted into a <a href="I%20Was%20Monty%27s%20Double%20%28film%29">film of the same name</a>. James starred, both as himself and Montgomery, alongside <a href="John%20Mills">John Mills</a> as an intelligence agent.

Today (The Smashing Pumpkins song)

"Today" is a song by American <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> band <a href="The%20Smashing%20Pumpkins">The Smashing Pumpkins</a>, written by lead vocalist and guitarist <a href="Billy%20Corgan">Billy Corgan</a>. The song, though seemingly upbeat, contains dark lyrics. Corgan wrote the song about a day in which he was having <a href="Suicidal%20ideation">suicidal thoughts</a>, exemplified by the reference to <a href="self-mutilation">self-mutilation</a> in the bridge ("Pink ribbon scars / that never forget / I tried so hard / to cleanse these regrets"). The contrast between the grim subject matter of the song and the soft instrumental part during the verses, coupled with use of <a href="irony">irony</a> in the lyrics, left many listeners unaware of the song's tale of <a href="clinical%20depression">depression</a> and desperation. The song alternates between quiet, dreamy verses and loud choruses with layered, <a href="Distortion%20%28guitar%29">distorted</a> guitar.

"Today" was released in September 1993 as the second single from the band's second album and <a href="major%20label">major label</a> debut, "<a href="Siamese%20Dream">Siamese Dream</a>". Although Corgan opted for "<a href="Cherub%20Rock">Cherub Rock</a>", the lead single from the album, to be the <a href="opening%20track">opening track</a>, "Today" and its follow-up "<a href="Disarm">Disarm</a>" are credited in <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> for popularizing the band and "sen[ding] ["Siamese Dream"] into the stratosphere". "Today" has been generally well received by critics; a "<a href="Blender%20%28magazine%29">Blender</a>" article described it as having "achieved a remarkable status as one of the defining songs of its generation, perfectly mirroring the fractured alienation of American youth in the 1990s".

After the release and minor success of the band's debut album, "<a href="Gish">Gish</a>", The Smashing Pumpkins were being hyped as "the next <a href="Nirvana%20%28band%29">Nirvana</a>". However, the band was experiencing several difficulties at the time. Drummer <a href="Jimmy%20Chamberlin">Jimmy Chamberlin</a> was undergoing an increasingly severe <a href="Drug%20addiction">addiction</a> to <a href="heroin">heroin</a>; <a href="James%20Iha">James Iha</a> and <a href="D%27arcy%20Wretzky">D'arcy Wretzky</a> had recently broken up their romantic relationship; and <a href="Billy%20Corgan">Billy Corgan</a> had become overweight, <a href="clinical%20depression">depressed</a> to the point of contemplating suicide, and plagued by <a href="writer%27s%20block">writer's block</a>. Corgan recalled that "after the first album, I became completely suicidal. It was an eight-month depression, give or take a month, and I was pretty suicidal for about two or three months." Under the pressure and other complications, the Pumpkins entered the Triclops Sound Studios in <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a> to record the follow-up to "Gish".

"Today" was the first song Corgan wrote for "Siamese Dream". Corgan said, "The day after I wrote 'Today', my manager heard it and said, 'It's a hit', and I guess in a way, it was." Corgan played the self-recorded <a href="demo%20%28music%29">demo</a> to producer <a href="Butch%20Vig">Butch Vig</a> and to the rest of his band, all of whom responded positively. "Today" already had a <a href="chord%20progression">chord progression</a> and a melody, but Corgan felt there needed to be an opening <a href="riff">riff</a> to the song. One day, "out of the blue, I heard the opening lick note for note in my head", Corgan said. "When I added the opening riff, it completely changed the character of the song. Suddenly, I had a song that was starting out quiet and then got very loud." Soon afterwards, <a href="Virgin%20Records">Virgin Records</a> executives were sent to check up on the band after hearing about their problems, but were pleased with the demo. The reaction from the executives only served to put more stress on Corgan; as a result, he recorded most of the guitar and bass guitar parts himself, including on the finished version of "Today".

"Siamese Dream" was completed after running four months after the deadline and considerably exceeding its budget. Virgin Records executives saw "Today" as the ideal lead single, but Corgan wanted "<a href="Cherub%20Rock">Cherub Rock</a>", one of the last songs written for the album, as the lead single. Ultimately, "Cherub Rock" was released first, but it was only a modest success. "Today" brought the band popularity through wide radio airplay and a successful music video.

"Today" is written in the <a href="Key%20%28music%29">key</a> of <a href="E-flat%20major">E-flat major</a> (E) and played in <a href="standard%20tuning">standard tuning</a>. While Corgan briefly considered simply tuning the guitar down a <a href="Semitone">half-step</a> and playing the song as if it were in the key of E, he said, "There was something about the E voicing that I liked. So it's absolutely, intentionally in E, not E." "Today" is one of the "Siamese Dream" songs on which Corgan took over Iha and D'arcy's duties on guitar and bass to ensure quality; Wretzky later stated that Corgan "can do something in three takes where it would maybe take me 20".

The song, spanning three minutes and 21 seconds, begins with a one-measure opening guitar riff that alludes to the E major-<a href="Pentatonic%20scale">pentatonic</a> scale. Corgan uses this riff (along with variations on it) to emphasize certain parts and to indicate shifts in the song. After the riff is played four times, the rest of the band enters backed with feedback-driven guitars. Ned Raggett of Allmusic commented on the song's ability to "alternate between calmer, almost <a href="The%20Cure">Cure</a>-like sections and the louder crunches, [and Corgan's] soon-to-be-trademark guitar style taking <a href="My%20Bloody%20Valentine%20%28band%29">My Bloody Valentine</a>'s own hypnotic riffing to more accessible results". The chorus, consisting of multiple guitar tracks playing <a href="barre%20chord">barre chord</a>s, is an example of the band's tendency to overdub several rhythm guitar tracks. While the song does not include a standard guitar solo, a short melodic guitar part appears during the bridge. Corgan explained: "The little guitar break over the C chord is actually a forwards sample that we laid in backwards. Then there's a weird vocal effect that moves across the speakers, a 'yan-yan-yan-yan' thing, which was generated by using a <a href="Roland%20RE-201">Roland Space Echo</a> to regenerate on the last word of the vocal line, 'I wanna turn you on.

The dark, <a href="irony">ironic</a> lyrics of "Today", describing a day when Corgan was feeling depressed and suicidal, contrast with the instrumentation. Michael Snyder of the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" said that the song is "downright pretty as rock ballads go" but that "Corgan manages to convey the exhilaration and tragic release he seeks." Corgan told "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" that "I was really suicidal ... I just thought it was funny to write a song that said today is the greatest day of your life because it can't get any worse." Corgan later compared writing the lyrics of "Today" and "<a href="Disarm">Disarm</a>" to "ripping [his] guts out". They played the song live for the first time on September 20, 1993, on "<a href="Late%20Night%20with%20David%20Letterman">Late Night with David Letterman</a>".

The <a href="music%20video">music video</a>, directed by <a href="St%C3%A9phane%20Sednaoui">Stéphane Sednaoui</a>, brought even more mainstream success to the band through repeated airplay on <a href="MTV">MTV</a>. The video debuted in September 1993. It was shot with low quality photographic equipment, which, like several other early Pumpkins videos, was an intentional stylistic decision. Corgan said that the plot of the video was inspired by a memory he had of an ice cream truck driver who, upon quitting his job, gave out his remaining stock of ice cream to the neighborhood children. This image was then melded with Sednaoui's own sensibilities inspired by the film "<a href="Zabriskie%20Point%20%28film%29">Zabriskie Point</a>". The video is available on "<a href="The%20Smashing%20Pumpkins%20%E2%80%93%20Greatest%20Hits%20Video%20Collection%20%281991%E2%80%932000%29">The Smashing Pumpkins – Greatest Hits Video Collection (1991–2000)</a>" DVD, released in 2001.

The video begins with Corgan reading a <a href="comic%20book">comic book</a> dressed in an ice cream man uniform. A clip of the intro to the song is played and stopped repeatedly before the song begins. Groups of two or more people are kissing each other around Corgan as he drives in an <a href="ice%20cream%20van">ice cream van</a> through a desert. Corgan picks up a dress-wearing Iha and the two drive for a while before stopping at a gas station, where Chamberlin and Wretzky appear as gas attendants. After Iha changes into a yellow and white <a href="cowboy">cowboy</a> outfit, the band paints the van in a multitude of colors. More people are shown kissing in the hills as the band drives away from the gas station in the van. However, Corgan is ultimately kicked out of the van, and the video ends with Corgan walking off the road wearing a cowboy hat as the van drives away. The video was filmed on August 29, 1993. The opening shots were filmed outside the Taft Hardware • Wilsons building located at 331 Center Street, <a href="Taft%2C%20California">Taft, CA</a>, 93268, on the 4th street side of the building.

"Today" has received generally positive reviews. Ned Raggett of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> called the song an "at-once storming but catchy smash single". Johnny Black of "<a href="Blender%20%28magazine%29">Blender</a>" noted that the song "has achieved a remarkable status as one of the defining songs of its generation". <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> cited "Today" as one of the highlights of "Siamese Dream". However, "<a href="Stylus%20Magazine">Stylus Magazine</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Brett Hickman said "nothing can make 'Today' sound fresh again. This is a prime example of the power that radio and MTV have in ruining a great song." "Today" topped "<a href="Eye%20Weekly">Eye Weekly</a>" magazine's year-end list of best singles, and also appeared at number 32 on "<a href="NME">NME</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s year-end list of best singles.

"Today" was one of the most successful early singles by The Smashing Pumpkins, and additionally has been recognized as one of the songs that brought the Pumpkins into the mainstream. The song was, at the time of its release, the highest-charting song by the band, peaking at number four on the "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" <a href="Modern%20Rock%20Tracks">Modern Rock Tracks</a>. The song also reached a peak position of number 28 on the "Billboard" <a href="Mainstream%20Rock%20Tracks">Mainstream Rock Tracks</a>, and was one of the first Pumpkins songs to chart in the UK, peaking at number 44. "Today" was later called one of the "hits that took the cool alternative band into stadium rock territory" by the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s Dan Tallis in a review of the band's greatest hits album, "<a href="Rotten%20Apples">Rotten Apples</a>", and similarly referred to as the "Smashing Pumpkins' red carpet to the glorified frat houses of alternative rock radio" by Nick Sylvester of Pitchfork Media.

"Today" has appeared on several Smashing Pumpkins official releases, including the band's greatest hits album "Rotten Apples" and the <a href="box%20set">box set</a> "<a href="Siamese%20Singles">Siamese Singles</a>".

Sweet Track

The Sweet Track is an <a href="ancient%20trackway">ancient trackway</a>, or <a href="causeway">causeway</a> in the <a href="Somerset%20Levels">Somerset Levels</a>, England, named after its finder, Ray Sweet. It was built in 3807 BC and is the second-oldest <a href="timber%20trackway">timber trackway</a> discovered in the British Isles, dating to the <a href="Neolithic%20British%20Isles">Neolithic</a>. It is now known that the Sweet Track was predominantly built over the course of an earlier structure, the <a href="Post%20Track">Post Track</a>.

The track extended across the now largely drained <a href="marsh">marsh</a> between what was then an island at <a href="Westhay">Westhay</a> and a ridge of high ground at <a href="Shapwick%2C%20Somerset">Shapwick</a>, a distance close to or around 1.2 miles. The track is one of a network that once crossed the Somerset Levels. Various artifacts and prehistoric finds, including a <a href="jadeitite">jadeitite</a> ceremonial axe head, have been found in the peat bogs along its length.

Construction was of crossed wooden poles, driven into the waterlogged soil to support a walkway that consisted mainly of planks of <a href="oak">oak</a>, laid end-to-end. The track was used for a period of only around ten years and was then abandoned, probably due to rising water levels. Following its discovery in 1970, most of the track has been left in its original location, with active <a href="Conservation-restoration%20of%20cultural%20heritage">conservation</a> measures taken, including a water pumping and distribution system to maintain the wood in its damp condition. Some of the track is stored at the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> and at the <a href="Museum%20of%20Somerset">Museum of Somerset</a> in Taunton. A reconstruction has been made on which visitors can walk, on the same line as the original in <a href="Shapwick%20Heath">Shapwick Heath National Nature Reserve</a>.

In the early <a href="4th%20millennium%20BC">fourth millennium BC</a> the track was built between an island at <a href="Westhay">Westhay</a> and a ridge of high ground at <a href="Shapwick%2C%20Somerset">Shapwick</a> close to the <a href="River%20Brue">River Brue</a>. A group of mounds at Westhay mark the site of <a href="Prehistoric%20Britain">prehistoric</a> lake dwellings, which were likely to have been similar to those found in the <a href="British%20Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> <a href="Glastonbury%20Lake%20Village">Glastonbury Lake Village</a> near <a href="Godney">Godney</a>, itself built on a <a href="marsh">morass</a> on an artificial foundation of timber filled with brushwood, <a href="bracken">bracken</a>, rubble, and <a href="clay">clay</a>.

The remains of similar tracks have been uncovered nearby, connecting settlements on the <a href="peat%20bog">peat bog</a>; they include the Honeygore, Abbotts Way, Bells, Bakers, Westhay, and Nidons trackways. Sites such as the nearby <a href="Meare%20Pool">Meare Pool</a> provide evidence that the purpose of these structures was to enable easier travel between the settlements. Investigation of the Meare Pool indicates that it was formed by the encroachment of <a href="raised%20bog">raised peat bogs</a> around it, particularly during the <a href="Subatlantic">Subatlantic</a> climatic period (1st millennium BC), and <a href="core%20sample">core sampling</a> demonstrates that it is filled with at least of detritus mud.

The two <a href="Meare%20Lake%20Village">Meare Lake Village</a>s within Meare Pool appear to originate from a collection of structures erected on the surface of the dried peat, such as tents, windbreaks and animal folds. Clay was later spread over the peat, providing raised stands for occupation, industry and movement, and in some areas thicker clay spreads accommodated <a href="hearth">hearth</a>s built of clay or stone.

The track was discovered in 1970 during <a href="peat">peat</a> excavations, and is named after its finder, Ray Sweet. The company for which he worked, E. J. Godwin, sent part of a plank from the track to John Coles, an assistant lecturer in archaeology at <a href="Cambridge%20University">Cambridge University</a>, who had carried out some excavations on nearby trackways. Coles' interest in the trackways led to the Somerset Levels Project, which ran from 1973 to 1989, funded by various donors including <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a>. The project undertook a range of local archaeological activities, and established the economic and geographic significance of various trackways from the third and first millennia BC. The work of John Coles, <a href="Bryony%20Coles">Bryony Coles</a>, and the Somerset Levels Project was recognised in 1996 when they won the <a href="Imperial%20Chemical%20Industries">Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI)</a> Award for the best archaeological project offering a major contribution to knowledge, and in 2006 with the European Archaeological Heritage Prize.

<a href="Dendrochronology">Dendrochronology</a> (tree-ring dating) of the timbers has enabled precise dating of the track, showing it was built in 3807 BC. This dating led to claims that the Sweet Track was the oldest roadway in the world, until the discovery in 2009 of a 6,000-year-old trackway built in 4100 BC, in Plumstead, near <a href="Belmarsh%20prison">Belmarsh prison</a>. Analysis of the Sweet Track's timbers has aided research into <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic Era</a> dendrochronology; comparisons with wood from the <a href="River%20Trent">River Trent</a> and a submerged forest at <a href="Stolford">Stolford</a> enabled a fuller mapping of the rings, and their relationship with the climate of the period.

The wood used to build the track is now classed as <a href="bog-wood">bog-wood</a>, the name given to wood (of any source) that for long periods (sometimes hundreds of thousands of years) has been buried in peat bogs, and kept from <a href="decomposition">decaying</a> by the <a href="acid">acid</a>ic and <a href="hypoxia%20%28environmental%29">anaerobic</a> bog conditions. Bog-wood usually is stained brown by <a href="tannin">tannin</a>s dissolved in the acidic water, and represents an early stage of <a href="fossil">fossil</a>isation. The age of the track prompted large-scale excavations in 1973, funded by the <a href="Department%20for%20Environment%2C%20Food%20and%20Rural%20Affairs">Department of the Environment</a>.

In 1973 a <a href="jadeitite">jadeitite</a> axehead was found alongside the track; it is thought to have been placed there as an offering. One of over 100 similar axe heads found in Britain and Ireland, its good condition and its precious material suggest that it was a symbolic axe, rather than one used to cut wood. Because of the difficulty of working this material, which was derived from the Alpine area of Europe, all the axe heads of this type found in Great Britain are thought to have been non-utilitarian and to have represented some form of currency or be the products of gift exchange. <a href="Radiocarbon">Radiocarbon</a> dating of the peat in which the axe head was discovered suggests that it was deposited in about 3200 BC. Wooden artefacts found at the site include paddles, a dish, arrow shafts, parts of four hazel bows, a <a href="throwing%20axe">throwing axe</a>, yew pins, digging sticks, a <a href="mattock">mattock</a>, a comb, toggles, and a spoon fragment. Finds made from other materials, such as flint flakes, arrowheads, and a <a href="flint%20tool">chipped flint axe</a> (in mint condition) have also been made.

A <a href="geophysical">geophysical</a> survey of the area in 2008 showed unclear <a href="magnetometer">magnetometer</a> data; the wood may be influencing the peat's <a href="hydrology">hydrology</a>, causing the loss or collection of minerals within the pore water and peat matrix.

The community that constructed the trackway were Neolithic farmers who had colonised the area around 3900 BC, and the evidence suggests that they were, by the time of construction, well organised and settled. Before this human incursion, the uplands surrounding the levels were heavily wooded, but local inhabitants began to clear these forests about this time to make way for an economy that was predominately pastoral with small amounts of cultivation. During the winter, the flooded areas of the levels would have provided this fishing, hunting, foraging and farming community with abundant fish and wildfowl; in the summer, the drier areas provided rich, open grassland for grazing cattle and sheep, reeds, wood, and timber for construction, and abundant wild animals, birds, fruit, and seeds. The need to reach the islands in the bog was sufficiently pressing for them to mount the enormous communal activity required for the task of stockpiling the timber and building the trackway, presumably when the waters were at their lowest after a dry period. The work required for the construction of the track demonstrates that they had advanced woodworking skills and suggests some differentiation of occupation among the workers. They also appear to have been managing the surrounding woodland for at least 120 years.

Built in 3807 or 3806 BC, the track was a walkway consisting mainly of planks of <a href="oak">oak</a> laid end-to-end, supported by crossed pegs of <a href="ash%20tree">ash</a>, oak, and <a href="Tilia">lime</a>, driven into the underlying peat. The planks, which were up to wide, long and less than thick, were cut from trees up to 400 years old and in diameter, felled and split using only stone axes, wooden wedges, and mallets. The length, straightness, and lack of forks or branches in the pegs suggest that they were taken from <a href="coppicing">coppiced</a> woodland. Longitudinal log rails up to long and in diameter, made of mostly <a href="hazel">hazel</a> and <a href="alder">alder</a>, were laid down and held in place with the pegs, which were driven at an angle across the rails and into the peat base of the bog. Notches were then cut into the planks to fit the pegs, and the planks were laid along the X shapes to form the walkway. In some places a second rail was placed on top of the first one to bring the plank above it level with the rest of the walkway. Some of the planks were then stabilised with slender, vertical wooden pegs driven through holes cut near the end of the planks and into the peat, and sometimes the clay, beneath. At the southern end of the construction smaller trees were used, and the planks split across the grain to utilise the full diameter of the trunk. Fragments of other tree species including <a href="holly">holly</a>, <a href="willow">willow</a>, <a href="Populus">poplar</a>, <a href="dogwood">dogwood</a>, <a href="ivy">ivy</a>, <a href="birch">birch</a>, and <a href="apple">apple</a> have also been found.

The <a href="wetland">wetland</a> setting indicates that the track components must have arrived <a href="prefabrication">prefabricated</a>, before being assembled on site, although the presence of wood chips and chopped branches indicates that some trimming was performed locally. The track was constructed from about of timber, but Coles estimates that once the materials were transported to the site, ten men could have assembled it in one day.

The Sweet Track was used only for about ten years; rising water levels may have engulfed it, and therefore curtailed its use. The variety of objects found alongside the track suggest that it was in daily use as part of the farming life of the community. Since its discovery, it has been determined that parts of the Sweet Track were built along the route of an even earlier track, the <a href="Post%20Track">Post Track</a>, which was constructed thirty years earlier in 3838 BC.

Most of the track remains in its original location, which is now within the <a href="Shapwick%20Heath">Shapwick Heath</a> <a href="biological%20Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest">biological Site of Special Scientific Interest</a> and <a href="National%20Nature%20Reserve">National Nature Reserve</a>. Following purchase of land by the <a href="National%20Heritage%20Memorial%20Fund">National Heritage Memorial Fund</a>, and installation of a water pumping and distribution system along a section, several hundred metres of the track's length are now being actively conserved. This method of preserving wetland archaeological remains (maintaining a high water table and saturating the site) is rare. A section, which lies within the land owned by the <a href="Nature%20Conservancy%20Council">Nature Conservancy Council</a>, has been surrounded by a clay bank to prevent drainage into surrounding lower peat fields, and water levels are regularly monitored. The viability of this method is demonstrated by comparing it with the nearby Abbot's Way, which has not had similar treatment, and which in 1996 was found to have become dewatered and desiccated. Evaluation and maintenance of water levels in the Shapwick Heath Nature Reserve involves the Nature Conservancy Council, the <a href="Department%20for%20Environment%2C%20Food%20and%20Rural%20Affairs">Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs</a>, and the Somerset Levels Project.

Although the wood recovered from the Levels was visually intact, it was extremely degraded and very soft. Where possible, pieces of wood in good condition, or the worked ends of pegs, were taken away and conserved for later analysis. The conservation process involved keeping the wood in heated tanks in a solution of <a href="polyethylene%20glycol">polyethylene glycol</a> and, by a process of evaporation, gradually replacing the water in the wood with the wax over a period of about nine months. After this treatment the wood was removed from the tank and wiped clean. As the wax cooled and hardened, the artefact became firm and could be handled freely.

A section of the track on land owned by <a href="Fisons">Fisons</a> (who extracted peat from the area) was donated to the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> in London. Although this short section can be assembled for display purposes, it is currently kept in store, off site, and under controlled conditions. A reconstructed section was displayed at the <a href="Peat%20Moors%20Centre">Peat Moors Centre</a> near <a href="Glastonbury">Glastonbury</a>. The centre was run by the Somerset Historic Environment Service, but was closed in October 2009 as a result of budget cuts imposed by <a href="Somerset%20County%20Council">Somerset County Council</a>. The main exhibits are extant, but future public access is uncertain. Other samples of the track are held in the <a href="Museum%20of%20Somerset">Museum of Somerset</a>.

Sections of the track have been designated as a <a href="scheduled%20monument">scheduled monument</a>, meaning that it is a "nationally important" historic structure and <a href="archaeological%20site">archaeological site</a> protected against unauthorised change. These sections are also included in <a href="Historic%20England">Historic England</a>'s <a href="Heritage%20at%20Risk%20Register">Heritage at Risk Register</a>.

James Tod

Lieutenant-Colonel James Tod (20 March 1782 – 18 November 1835) was an English-born officer of the <a href="British%20East%20India%20Company">British East India Company</a> and an <a href="Orientalism">Oriental scholar</a>. He combined his official role and his amateur interests to create a series of works about the history and geography of India, and in particular the area then known as <a href="Rajputana">Rajputana</a> that corresponds to the present day state of <a href="Rajasthan">Rajasthan</a>, and which Tod referred to as "Rajast'han".

Tod was born in London and educated in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>. He joined the East India Company as a military officer and travelled to India in 1799 as a <a href="cadet">cadet</a> in the <a href="Bengal%20Army">Bengal Army</a>. He rose quickly in rank, eventually becoming captain of an escort for an <a href="Envoy%20%28title%29">envoy</a> in a <a href="Scindia">Sindia</a>n royal court. After the <a href="Third%20Anglo-Maratha%20War">Third Anglo-Maratha War</a>, during which Tod was involved in the intelligence department, he was appointed <a href="Political%20Resident">Political Agent</a> for some areas of Rajputana. His task was to help unify the region under the control of the East India Company. During this period Tod conducted most of the research that he would later publish. Tod was initially successful in his official role, but his methods were questioned by other members of the East India Company. Over time, his work was restricted and his areas of oversight were significantly curtailed. In 1823, owing to declining health and reputation, Tod resigned his post as Political Agent and returned to England.

Back home in England, Tod published a number of academic works about Indian history and geography, most notably "Annals and Antiquities of Rajast'han", based on materials collected during his travels. He retired from the military in 1826, and married Julia Clutterbuck that same year. He died in 1835, aged 53.

Tod was born in <a href="Islington">Islington</a>, London, on 20 March 1782. He was the second son for his parents, James and Mary (née Heatly), both of whom came from families of "high standing", according to his major biographer, the historian Jason Freitag. He was educated in Scotland, whence his ancestors came, although precisely where he was schooled is unknown. Those ancestors included people who had fought with the <a href="King%20of%20Scots">King of Scots</a>, <a href="Robert%20the%20Bruce">Robert the Bruce</a>; he took pride in this fact and had an acute sense of what he perceived to be the chivalric values of those times.

As with many people of Scots descent who sought adventure and success at that time, Tod joined the British East India Company and initially spent some time studying at the <a href="Royal%20Military%20Academy%2C%20Woolwich">Royal Military Academy, Woolwich</a>. He left England for India in 1799 and in doing so followed in the footsteps of various other members of his family, including his father, although Tod senior had not been in the Company but had instead owned an <a href="Indigofera">indigo</a> plantation at <a href="Mirzapur">Mirzapur</a>. The young Tod journeyed as a cadet in the Bengal Army, appointment to which position was at the time reliant upon <a href="patronage">patronage</a>. He was appointed <a href="First%20lieutenant">lieutenant</a> in May 1800 and in 1805 was able to arrange his posting as a member of the escort to a family friend who had been appointed as Envoy and <a href="Resident%20%28title%29">Resident</a> to a Sindian royal court. By 1813 he had achieved promotion to the rank of <a href="Captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">captain</a> and was commanding the escort.

Rather than being situated permanently in one place, the royal court was moved around the kingdom. Tod undertook various <a href="Topography">topographical</a> and geological studies as it travelled from one area to another, using his training as an engineer and employing other people to do much of the field work. These studies culminated in 1815 with the production of a map which he presented to the <a href="Governor-General%20of%20India">Governor-General</a>, the <a href="Marquis%20of%20Hastings">Marquis of Hastings</a>. This map of "Central India" (his phrase) became of strategic importance to the British as they were soon to fight the Third Anglo-Maratha War. During that war, which ran from 1817 to 1818, Tod acted as a superintendent of the intelligence department and was able to draw on other aspects of regional knowledge which he had acquired while moving around with the court. He also drew up various strategies for the military campaign.

In 1818 he was appointed Political Agent for various states of western Rajputana, in the northwest of India, where the British East India Company had come to amicable arrangements with the Rajput rulers in order to exert <a href="Indirect%20rule">indirect control</a> over the area. The anonymous author of the introduction to Tod's posthumously published book, "Travels in Western India", says that 

Tod continued his surveying work in this physically-challenging, arid and mountainous area. His responsibilities were extended quickly: initially involving himself with the regions of <a href="Mewar">Mewar</a>, <a href="Kota%20District">Kota</a>, <a href="Sirohi">Sirohi</a> and <a href="Bundi">Bundi</a>, he soon added <a href="Marwar">Marwar</a> to his portfolio and in 1821 was also given responsibility for <a href="Jaisalmer">Jaisalmer</a>. These areas were considered a strategic buffer zone against Russian advances from the north which, it was feared, might result in a move into India via the <a href="Khyber%20Pass">Khyber Pass</a>. Tod believed that to achieve cohesion it was necessary that the Rajput states should contain only Rajput people, with all others being expelled. This would assist in achieving stability in the areas, thus limiting the likelihood of the inhabitants being influenced by outside forces. According to Ramya Sreenivasan, a researcher of religion and caste in early modern Rajasthan and of colonialism, Tod's "transfers of territory between various chiefs and princes helped to create territorially consolidated states and 'routinised' political hierarchies." His successes were plentiful and the "<a href="Oxford%20Dictionary%20of%20National%20Biography">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</a>" notes that Tod was 

Tod was not, however, universally respected in the East India Company. His immediate superior, <a href="David%20Ochterlony">David Ochterlony</a>, was unsettled by Tod's rapid rise and frequent failure to consult with him. One Rajput prince objected to Tod's close involvement in the affairs of his state and succeeded in persuading the authorities to remove Marwar from Tod's area of influence. In 1821 his favouritism towards one party in a princely dispute, contrary to the orders given to him, gave rise to a severe reprimand and a formal restriction of his ability to operate without consulting Ochterlony, as well as the removal of Kota from his charge. Jaisalmer was then taken out of his sphere of influence in 1822, as official concerns grew regarding his sympathy for the Rajput princes. This and other losses of status, such as the reduction in the size of his escort, caused him to believe that his personal reputation and ability to work successfully in Mewar, by now the one area still left to him, was too diminished to be acceptable. He resigned his role as Political Agent in Mewar later that year, citing ill health. <a href="Reginald%20Heber">Reginald Heber</a>, the Bishop of <a href="Anglican%20Diocese%20of%20Calcutta">Calcutta</a>, commented that 

In February 1823, Tod left India for England, having first travelled to <a href="Bombay">Bombay</a> by a circuitous route for his own pleasure.

During the last years of his life Tod talked about India at functions in Paris and elsewhere across Europe. He also became a member of the newly established <a href="Royal%20Asiatic%20Society">Royal Asiatic Society</a> in London, for whom he acted for some time as librarian. He suffered an <a href="apoplexy">apoplectic fit</a> in 1825 as a consequence of overwork, and retired from his military career in the following year, soon after he had been promoted to <a href="Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">lieutenant-colonel</a>. His marriage to Julia Clutterbuck (daughter of <a href="Henry%20Clutterbuck">Henry Clutterbuck</a>) in 1826 produced three children – Grant Heatly Tod-Heatly, Edward H. M. Tod and Mary Augusta Tod – but his health, which had been poor for much of his life, was declining. Having lived at Birdhurst, <a href="Croydon">Croydon</a>, from October 1828, Tod and his family moved to London three years later. He spent much of the last year of his life abroad in an attempt to cure a chest complaint and died on 18 November 1835 soon after his return to England from Italy. The cause of death was an apoplectic fit sustained on the day of his wedding anniversary, although he survived for a further 27 hours. He had moved into a house in <a href="Regent%27s%20Park">Regent's Park</a> earlier in that year.

According to Theodore Koditschek, whose fields of study include <a href="historiography">historiography</a> and British imperial history, Tod saw the Rajputs as "natural allies of the British in their struggles against the <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal</a> and <a href="Maratha%20Empire">Maratha</a> states". Norbert Peabody, an anthropologist and historian, has gone further, arguing that "maintaining the active support of groups, like the Rajputs for example, was not only important in meeting the threat of indigenous rivals but also in countering the imperial aspirations of other European powers." He stated that some of Tod's thoughts were "implicated in [British] colonial policy toward western India for over a century."

Tod favoured the then-fashionable concept of <a href="Romantic%20nationalism">Romantic nationalism</a>. Influenced by this, he thought that each <a href="princely%20state">princely state</a> should be inhabited by only one community and his policies were designed to expel Marathas, <a href="Pindari">Pindari</a>s and other groups from Rajput territories. It also influenced his instigation of treaties that were intended to redraw the territorial boundaries of the various states. The geographical and political boundaries before his time had in some cases been blurred, primarily due to local arrangements based on common kinship, and he wanted a more evident delineation of the entities, He was successful in both of these endeavours.

Tod was unsuccessful in implementing another of his ideas, which was also based on the ideology of Romantic nationalism. He believed that the replacement of Maratha rule with that of the British had resulted in the Rajputs merely swapping the onerous overlordship of one government for that of another. Although he was one of the architects of indirect rule, in which the princes looked after domestic affairs but paid tribute to the British for protection in foreign affairs, he was also a critic of it. He saw the system as one that prevented achievement of true nationhood, and therefore, as Peabody describes, "utterly subversive to the stated goal of preserving them as viable entities." Tod wrote in 1829 that the system of indirect rule had a tendency to "national degradation" of the Rajput territories and that this undermined them because

There was a political aspect to his views: if the British recast themselves as overseers seeking to re-establish lost Rajput nations, then this would at once smooth the relationship between those two parties and distinguish the threatening, denationalising Marathas from the paternal, nation-creating British. It was an argument that had been deployed by others in the European arena, including in relation to the way in which Britain portrayed the imperialism of Napoleonic France as denationalising those countries which it conquered, whereas (it was claimed) British imperialism freed people; <a href="Lord%20William%20Bentinck">William Bentinck</a>, a soldier and statesmen who later in life served as Governor-General of India, noted in 1811 that "Bonaparte made kings; England makes nations". However, his arguments in favour of granting sovereignty to the Rajputs failed to achieve that end, although the <a href="Book%20frontispiece">frontispiece</a> to volume one of his "Annals" did contain a plea to the then English King <a href="George%20IV">George IV</a> to reinstate the "former independence" of the Rajputs.

While he viewed the Muslim Mughals as despotic and the Marathas as predatory, Tod saw the Rajput social systems as being similar to the <a href="feudal%20system">feudal system</a> of medieval Europe, and their traditions of recounting history through the generations as similar to the clan poets of the <a href="Scottish%20clan">Scottish Highlanders</a>. There was, he felt, a system of <a href="checks%20and%20balances">checks and balances</a> between the ruling princes and their <a href="vassal">vassal</a> lords, a tendency for feuds and other rivalries, and often a <a href="serf">serf</a>-like peasantry. The Rajputs were, in his opinion, on the same developmental trajectory that nations such as Britain had followed. His ingenious use of these viewpoints later enabled him to promote in his books the notion that there was a shared experience between the people of Britain and this community in a distant, relatively unexplored area of the empire. He speculated that there was a common ancestor shared by the Rajputs and Europeans somewhere deep in prehistory and that this might be proven by comparison of the commonality in their history of ideas, such as myth and legend. In this he shared a contemporary aspiration to prove that all communities across the world had a common origin. There was another appeal inherent in a feudal system, and it was not unique to Tod: the historian <a href="Thomas%20R.%20Metcalf">Thomas R. Metcalf</a> has said that Above all, the chivalric ideal viewed character as more worthy of admiration than wealth or intellect, and this appealed to the old landed classes at home as well as to many who worked for the <a href="Indian%20Civil%20Service">Indian Civil Service</a>.

In the 1880s, <a href="Alfred%20Comyn%20Lyall">Alfred Comyn Lyall</a>, an administrator of the <a href="British%20Raj">British Raj</a> who also studied history, revisited Tod's classification and asserted that the Rajput society was in fact tribal, based on kinship rather than feudal vassalage. He had previously generally agreed with Tod, who acknowledged claims that blood-ties played some sort of role in the relationship between princes and vassals in many states. In shifting the emphasis from a feudal to a tribal basis, Lyall was able to deny the possibility that the Rajput kingdoms might gain sovereignty. If Rajput society was not feudal, then it was not on the same trajectory that European nations had followed, thereby forestalling any need to consider that they might evolve into sovereign states. There was thus no need for Britain to consider itself to be illegitimately governing them.

Tod's enthusiasm for bardic poetry reflected the works of <a href="Sir%20Walter%20Scott">Sir Walter Scott</a> on Scottish subjects, which had a considerable influence both on British literary society and, bearing in mind Tod's Scottish ancestry, on Tod himself. Tod reconstructed Rajput history on the basis of the ancient texts and folklore of the Rajputs, although not everyone – for example, the polymath <a href="James%20Mill">James Mill</a> – accepted the historical validity of the native works. Tod also used <a href="philology">philological techniques</a> to reconstruct areas of Rajput history that were not even known to the Rajputs themselves, by drawing on works such as the religious texts known as "<a href="Purana">Purana</a>s".

Koditschek says that Tod "developed an interest in triangulating local culture, politics and history alongside his maps", and Metcalf believes that Tod "ordered [the Rajputs'] past as well as their present" while working in India. During his time in Rajputana, Tod was able to collect materials for his "Annals and Antiquities of Rajast'han", which detailed the contemporary geography and history of Rajputana and Central India along with the history of the Rajput clans who ruled most of the area at that time. Described by historian Crispin Bates as "a romantic historical and anecdotal account" and by David Arnold, another historian, as a "travel narrative" by "one of India's most influential Romantic writers", the work was published in two volumes, in 1829 and 1832, and included illustrations and engravings by notable artists such as the <a href="James%20Sargant%20Storer">Storers</a>, <a href="Louis%20Haghe">Louis Haghe</a> and either <a href="Edward%20Finden">Edward</a> or <a href="William%20Finden">William Finden</a>. He had to finance publication himself: sales of works on history had been moribund for some time and his name was not particularly familiar either at home or abroad. Original copies are now scarce, but they have been reprinted in many editions. The version published in 1920, which was edited by the <a href="Oriental%20studies">orientalist</a> and <a href="Folklore">folklorist</a> <a href="William%20Crooke">William Crooke</a>, is significantly editorialised.

Freitag has argued that the "Annals" "is first and foremost a story of the heroes of Rajasthan ... plotted in a certain way – there are villains, glorious acts of bravery, and a chivalric code to uphold". So dominant did Tod's work become in the popular and academic mind that they largely replaced the older accounts upon which Tod based much of his content, notably the "Prithvirãj Rãjo" and the "<a href="Muhnot%20Nainsi">Nainsi ri Khyãt</a>". <a href="Kumar%20Suresh%20Singh">Kumar Singh</a>, of the <a href="Anthropological%20Survey%20of%20India">Anthropological Survey of India</a>, has explained that the "Annals" were primarily based on "bardic accounts and personal encounters" and that they "glorified and romanticised the Rajput rulers and their country" but ignored other communities.

One aspect of history that Tod studied in his "Annals" was the genealogy of the "Chathis Rajkula" (<a href="36%20royal%20races">36 royal races</a>), for the purpose of which he took advice on linguistic issues from a panel of "<a href="pandit">pandit</a>s", including a <a href="Jain">Jain</a> guru called <a href="Yati">Yati</a> Gyanchandra. He said that he was "desirous of epitomising the chronicles of the martial races of Central and Western India" and that this necessitated study of their genealogy. The sources for this were "Puranas" held by the <a href="Rana%20%28title%29">Rana</a> of <a href="Udaipur">Udaipur</a>.

Tod also submitted archæological papers to the Royal Asiatic Society's "Transactions" series. He was interested in <a href="numismatics">numismatics</a> as well, and he discovered the first specimens of <a href="Bactria">Bactria</a>n and <a href="Indo-Greek">Indo-Greek</a> coins from the <a href="Hellenistic">Hellenistic</a> period following the conquests of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>, which were described in his books. These ancient kingdoms had been largely forgotten or considered semi-legendary, but Tod's findings confirmed the long-term Greek presence in Afghanistan and Punjab. Similar coins have been found in large quantities since his death.

In addition to these writings, he produced a paper on the politics of Western India that was appended to the report of the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> committee on Indian affairs, 1833. He had also taken notes on his journey to Bombay and collated them for another book, "Travels in Western India". That book was published posthumously in 1839.

Criticism of the "Annals" came soon after publication. The anonymous author of the introduction to his posthumously published "Travels" states that 

Further criticism followed. Tod was an officer of the British imperial system, at that time the world's dominant power. Working in India, he attracted the attention of local rulers who were keen to tell their own tales of defiance against the Mughal empire. He heard what they told him but knew little of what they omitted. He was a soldier writing about a caste renowned for its martial abilities, and he was aided in his writings by the very people whom he was documenting. He had been interested in Rajput history prior to coming into contact with them in an official capacity, as administrator of the region in which they lived. These factors, says Freitag, contribute to why the "Annals" were "manifestly biased". Freitag argues that critics of Tod's literary output can be split into two groups: those who concentrate on his errors of fact and those who concentrate on his failures of interpretation.

Tod relied heavily on existing Indian texts for his historical information and most of these are today considered unreliable. Crooke's introduction to Tod's 1920 edition of the "Annals" recorded that the old Indian texts recorded "the facts, not as they really occurred, but as the writer and his contemporaries supposed that they occurred." Crooke also says that Tod's "knowledge of ethnology was imperfect, and he was unable to reject the local chronicles of the Rajputs." More recently, Robin Donkin, a historian and geographer, has argued that, with one exception, "there are no native literary works with a developed sense of chronology, or indeed much sense of place, before the thirteenth century", and that researchers must rely on the accounts of travellers from outside the country.

Tod's work relating to the genealogy of the "Chathis Rajkula" was criticised as early as 1872, when an anonymous reviewer in the "<a href="Calcutta%20Review">Calcutta Review</a>" said that Other examples of dubious interpretations made by Tod include his assertions regarding the ancestry of the <a href="Mohil">Mohil</a> Rajput clan when, even today, there is insufficient evidence to prove his point. He also mistook <a href="Rana%20Kumbha">Rana Kumbha</a>, a ruler of Mewar in the fifteenth century, as being the husband of the princess-saint <a href="Mira%20Bai">Mira Bai</a> and misrepresented the story of the queen <a href="Rani%20Padmini">Padmini</a>. The founder of the <a href="Archaeological%20Survey%20of%20India">Archaeological Survey of India</a>, <a href="Alexander%20Cunningham">Alexander Cunningham</a>, writing in 1885, noted that Tod had made "a whole bundle of mistakes" in relation to the dating of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Khanwa">Battle of Khanwa</a>, and Crooke notes in his introduction to the 1920 edition that Tod's "excursions into philology are the diversions of a clever man, not of a trained scholar, but interested in the subject as an amateur." <a href="Michael%20W.%20Meister">Michael Meister</a>, an architectural historian and professor of South Asia Studies, has commented that Tod had a "general reputation for inaccuracy ... among Indologists by late in the nineteenth century", although the opinion of those Indologists sometimes prevented them from appreciating some of the useful aspects in his work. That reputation persists, with one modern writer, V. S. Srivastava of Rajasthan's Department of Archaeology and Museums, commenting that his works "are erroneous and misleading at places and they are to be used with caution as a part of sober history".

In its time, Tod's work was influential even among officials of the government, although it was never formally recognised as authoritative. Andrea Major, who is a cultural and colonial historian, has commented on a specific example, that of the tradition of <a href="Sati%20%28practice%29">sati</a> (ritual immolation of a widow): 

The romantic nationalism that Tod espoused was used by Indian nationalist writers, especially those from the 1850s, as they sought to resist British control of the country. Works such as <a href="Jyotirindranath%20Tagore">Jyotirindranath Tagore</a>'s "Sarojini ba Chittor Akrama" and <a href="Girishchandra%20Ghosh">Girishchandra Ghosh</a>'s "Ananda Raho" retold Tod's vision of the Rajputs in a manner to further their cause. Other works which drew their story from Tod's works include "Padmini Upakhyan" (1858) by <a href="Rangalal%20Banerjee">Rangalal Banerjee</a> and "Krishna Kumari" (1861) by <a href="Michael%20Madhusudan%20Dutt">Michael Madhusudan Dutt</a>.

In modern-day India, he is still revered by those whose ancestors he documented in good light. In 1997, the Maharana Mewar Charitable Foundation instituted an award named after Tod and intended it to be given to modern non-Indian writers who exemplified Tod's understanding of the area and its people. In other recognition of his work in Mewar Province, a village has been named "Todgarh", and it has been claimed that Tod was in fact a Rajput as an outcome of the process of <a href="karma">karma</a> and <a href="Reincarnation">rebirth</a>. Freitag describes the opinion of the Rajput people 

Furthermore, Freitag points out that "the information age has also anointed Tod as the spokesman for Rajasthan, and the glories of India in general, as attested by the prominent quotations from him that appear in tourism related websites."

Published works by James Tod include:


The Royal Asiatic Society is preparing a new edition of the "Annals" in celebration of the Society's bicentenary in 2023. A team of scholars are producing the original text of the first edition, together with a new introduction and annotations, and also a companion work that "will provide critical interpretive apparatus and contextual frames to aid in reading this iconic text." Containing "additional visual and archival material from the Society’s collections and beyond", it is to be co-published by the Society and <a href="Yale%20University%20Press">Yale University Press</a> in 2021.

38th (Welsh) Infantry Division

The 38th (Welsh) Division (initially the 43rd Division, later the 38th (Welsh) Infantry Division and then the 38th Infantry (Reserve) Division) of the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> was active during both the <a href="World%20War%20I">First</a> and <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World Wars</a>. In 1914, the <a href="Division%20%28military%29">division</a> was raised as the 43rd Division of <a href="Herbert%20Kitchener">Herbert Kitchener</a>'s <a href="Kitchener%27s%20Army">New Army</a>, and was originally intended to form part of a 50,000-strong Welsh Army Corps that had been championed by <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a>; the assignment of Welsh recruits to other formations meant that this concept was never realised. The 43rd was renamed the 38th (Welsh) Division on 29 April 1915, and shipped to France later that year. It arrived in France with a poor reputation, seen as a political formation that was ill-trained and poorly led. The division's <a href="baptism%20by%20fire">baptism by fire</a> came in the first days of the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme">Battle of the Somme</a>, where it captured Mametz Wood at the loss of nearly 4,000 men. This strongly held German position needed to be secured in order to facilitate the next phase of the Somme offensive, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bazentin%20Ridge">Battle of Bazentin Ridge</a>. Despite securing its objective, the division's reputation was adversely affected by miscommunication among senior officers.

A year later the division made a successful attack in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pilckem%20Ridge">Battle of Pilckem Ridge</a>, the opening of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Passchendaele">Third Battle of Ypres</a>. This action redeemed the division in the eyes of the upper hierarchy of the British military. In 1918, during the German <a href="Spring%20Offensive">Spring Offensive</a> and the subsequent Allied <a href="Hundred%20Days%20Offensive">Hundred Days Offensive</a>, the division attacked several fortified German positions. It crossed the <a href="Ancre">Ancre</a> River, broke through the <a href="Hindenburg%20Line">Hindenburg Line</a> and German positions on the River <a href="Selle">Selle</a>, ended the war on the Belgian frontier, and was considered one of the Army's elite units. The division was not chosen to be part of the <a href="Occupation%20of%20the%20Rhineland">Occupation of the Rhineland</a> after the war, and was demobilised over several months. It ceased to exist by March 1919.

In March 1939, following the reemergence of <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Germany</a> and its <a href="German%20occupation%20of%20Czechoslovakia">occupation of Czechoslovakia</a>, the British army increased the number of divisions within the <a href="Army%20Reserve%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Territorial Army</a> by duplicating existing units. On paper, the division was recreated as the 38th (Welsh) Infantry Division, a duplicate of the <a href="53rd%20%28Welsh%29%20Infantry%20Division">53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division</a>. It was formed in September 1939, however it was never deployed overseas as a division, having been restricted to home defence duties around the United Kingdom. In 1944, it was disbanded and its units were either deployed or broken up to reinforce the <a href="21st%20Army%20Group">21st Army Group</a> in Normandy during <a href="Operation%20Overlord">Operation Overlord</a>. The 38th Division was recreated on 1 September 1944 as the 38th Infantry (Reserve) Division, a training formation that took over the role previously occupied by the <a href="80th%20Infantry%20%28Reserve%29%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">80th Infantry (Reserve) Division</a>. In this form, the division completed the training of recruits, who were then dispatched overseas as reinforcements. At the end of the war, the division was again stood down.

On 28 July 1914, the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a> began; on 4 August, <a href="German%20invasion%20of%20Belgium">Germany invaded Belgium</a> and the United Kingdom entered the war to uphold the <a href="Treaty%20of%20London%20%281839%29">Treaty of London (1839)</a>. Britain faced a continental war it was not prepared to fight; the <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Expeditionary Force</a> was dispatched but the country lacked the forces required for the protracted war envisioned by the military leadership.

On 5 August, <a href="Herbert%20Kitchener">Herbert Kitchener</a> was appointed <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20War">Secretary of State for War</a>. This position allowed Kitchener a largely independent role within the <a href="war%20cabinet">war cabinet</a>. His first act, the next day, was to request <a href="Government%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">parliamentary approval</a> to increase the strength of the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> by 500,000 men. Over the following days, the <a href="Army%20Council%20%281904%29">Army Council</a> laid out plans for Kitchener's proposed expansion: traditional recruitment would be used to expand the regular army, bypassing the county associations and thus avoiding expanding the <a href="Territorial%20Force">Territorial Force</a>. The first wave, originally termed the New Expeditionary Force, became the First New Army. Historian Peter Simkins wrote that Kitchener held the Territorial Force in disdain, calling it an ill-trained "Town Clerk's Army", and this was partially why he set up a parallel recruitment system. Simkins noted that it would be a "gross oversimplification to ascribe Kitchener's decision merely to prejudice and ignorance". Had the Territorial Force been used as the basis for expansion it would have been "swamped" and "rendered temporarily incapable of carrying out any function at all", when a "viable home defence force" was needed due to the threat of a German invasion.

On 19 September 1914, <a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a> <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a> stated publicly that he "should like to see a Welsh Army in the field". This thought quickly picked up support from politicians and from Kitchener; a Welsh Army Corps of two divisions totalling 50,000 men was approved on 10 October. The recruits were to be drawn from Wales as well as <a href="Monmouthshire%20%28historic%29">Monmouthshire</a> and from Welshmen living in <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, <a href="London">London</a> and <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>. The creation of the corps soon became a source of dispute between Lloyd George and Kitchener and was never realised due to a lack of potential recruits. <a href="Llewelyn%20Wyn%20Griffith">Llewelyn Wyn Griffith</a>, an officer within the 38th (Welsh) Division, commented that "the population of Wales was not sufficient to raise two full divisions and all the corps units required". By the end of 1914, it had been decided that only one division would be raised. The 10,000 men, who had since joined the Welsh Army Corps, were formed into the 43rd Division of Kitchener's Fifth New Army. The division comprised the <a href="113th%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">113th</a>, <a href="114th%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">114th</a> and <a href="115th%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">115th Brigades</a>, and was made up of battalions from the <a href="Royal%20Welch%20Fusiliers">Royal Welsh Fusiliers</a> (RWF), the <a href="South%20Wales%20Borderers">South Wales Borderers</a> (SWB) and the <a href="Welch%20Regiment">Welsh Regiment</a> (Welsh). On 19 January 1915, <a href="Major%20General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Major-General</a> <a href="Ivor%20Philipps">Ivor Philipps</a> was assigned as the first divisional commander. By March, 20,000 men had been enlisted and over the coming months the first units reached full strength. Despite steady recruitment, by 30 June 1915, 20 per cent of recruits had been removed, having been discharged primarily for medical reasons or transferred to other units leaving 27,836 men within the ostensible Welsh Army Corps. The division was made up predominately of Welshmen, but it included soldiers from the rest of the United Kingdom and several other nations.
On <a href="Saint%20David%27s%20Day">Saint David's Day</a> (1 March 1915), the new division was inspected by Lloyd George. During April, the Fourth New Army was broken up to provide reinforcements for deployed combat units. The Fifth New Army, in turn, was renamed the Fourth New Army. As part of this re-organisation, the 38th Division became the <a href="31st%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">31st Division</a>. On 29 April, the 43rd was renamed the 38th (Welsh) Division. The division spent most of 1915 dispersed, with the majority located across <a href="North%20Wales">North Wales</a> with units training at <a href="Pwllheli">Pwllheli</a>, <a href="Colwyn%20Bay">Colwyn Bay</a>, <a href="Llandudno">Llandudno</a> and <a href="Rhyl">Rhyl</a>; some units were based in the south at <a href="Abergavenny">Abergavenny</a>. At these locations, the men undertook <a href="Recruit%20training">basic training</a>, were <a href="Military%20parade">drilled</a>, and trained for open warfare. On 19 August, the division moved to <a href="Winchester">Winchester</a>, England, where it assembled for the first time as a coherent single unit. Final training took place and limited instruction was given on tactics for <a href="trench%20warfare">trench warfare</a>, on the assumption that practical experience would be easier to gain in France. Following training, it took until November for the division to be fully equipped with rifles. To be declared fit for overseas service, the division's soldiers had to fire 24 rounds on a rifle range. On 29 November, the division was inspected for the last time before its deployment; <a href="Mary%20of%20Teck">Queen Mary</a> and <a href="Mary%2C%20Princess%20Royal%20and%20Countess%20of%20Harewood">Princess Mary</a> reviewed the troops at <a href="Crawley%20Down">Crawley Down</a>.

Prior to its deployment, the division was roughly 18,500 men strong. During November, the division departed from <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a> and by 5 December it had arrived in France at <a href="Le%20Havre">Le Havre</a>. The division's artillery initially remained behind to conduct live fire exercises at <a href="Larkhill%20Garrison">Larkhill</a>, but had re-joined the division by the end of December.

The initial reaction by the regular army to the division was one of hostility. The division was seen as lacking experience and training; the latter was a criticism levelled at all New Army divisions. Questions were also raised about the divisional leadership and about securing officer commissions through influence. Historian Clive Hughes wrote, "regulars professed disgust at the blatantly political character" of the division. The prime example of this concern was Philipps himself. He had retired from the <a href="British%20Indian%20Army">Indian Army</a> in 1903 as a <a href="Major%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Major</a>, and then joined the <a href="Pembroke%20Yeomanry">Pembroke Yeomanry</a> becoming the regiment's <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Colonel</a> in 1908. Prior to the war, Philipps was elected a <a href="member%20of%20parliament">member of parliament</a>, and was part of Lloyd George's <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal Party</a>. Following the outbreak of the war, he was promoted to <a href="Brigadier-general%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Brigadier-General</a> and given a command of a brigade. He was then posted to Lloyd George's <a href="Minister%20of%20Munitions">Minister of Munitions</a>, before being given command of the 38th ahead of regular army officers who held <a href="seniority">seniority</a>. Hughes commented that Philipps's political appointment "can hardly have improved his standing" and that he was viewed as a "jumped-up ex-Indian Army major who had no right to a divisional command", who had received his position via his association with Lloyd George.

Once in France, the division joined <a href="XI%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">XI Corps</a> and was placed in reserve, relieving the <a href="46th%20%28North%20Midland%29%20Division">46th (North Midland) Division</a>. The first casualties were soon suffered due to training accidents with <a href="Hand%20grenade">grenades</a>. The division was then temporarily split up and spent time attached to the <a href="Guards%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Guards Division</a> and <a href="19th%20%28Western%29%20Division">19th (Western) Division</a>, to gain experience in trench warfare. It relieved the 19th (Western) Division and until the summer manned the front in the <a href="Nord-Pas-de-Calais">Nord-Pas-de-Calais</a> region. It was rotated along the XI Corps sector, and spent time in <a href="Festubert">Festubert</a>, <a href="Givenchy-l%C3%A8s-la-Bass%C3%A9e">Givenchy</a>, <a href="La%20Gorgue">La Gorgue</a>, <a href="Laventie">Laventie</a> and <a href="Neuve%20Chapelle">Neuve Chapelle</a>. Units of the division took turns on the front line, maintained positions, conducted trench raids and were subjected to German bombardments, all of which allowed the men to gain experience of active service conditions. During this period <a href="Captain%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29">Captain</a> <a href="Goronwy%20Owen%20%28politician%29">Goronwy Owen</a> of the 15th RWF carried out a trench raid into <a href="no%20man%27s%20land">no man's land</a>, where he located a party of German soldiers who had just finished laying <a href="barbed%20wire">barbed wire</a>. Owen followed the Germans back to their trench and ambushed them. The divisional history comments that "the greater portion [of the German party] were killed" and the raid was considered by the Army to be "the third best ... carried out so far" in the war. For his actions, Owen was <a href="mentioned%20in%20dispatches">mentioned in dispatches</a>.
During 10–11 June 1916, the division was relieved by the <a href="61st%20%282nd%20South%20Midland%29%20Division">61st (2nd South Midland) Division</a> and moved into reserve. It then moved south and joined <a href="XVII%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">XVII Corps</a> of the <a href="Third%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Third Army</a> to train for the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme">Battle of the Somme</a>. New trenches were dug and the division made practice attacks on them using novel tactics: attacking in waves in conjunction with artillery and machine gun fire. Towards the end of the month, the division moved further south to the <a href="River%20Somme">Somme valley</a>. They then joined <a href="II%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">II Corps</a> and were placed in reserve. The division was allocated to the second wave, which was intended to exploit the expected success of both the Third and <a href="Fourth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Fourth Armies</a>. After the breach of the German lines, the <a href="Reserve%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Reserve Army</a> cavalry divisions would capture <a href="Bapaume">Bapaume</a>. The 38th (Welsh) Division would then move forward to relieve the cavalry and secure the town, to allow the cavalry to advance north towards <a href="Arras">Arras</a>.

1 July was the <a href="First%20Day%20on%20the%20Somme">first day on the Somme</a> and although it was behind the lines in reserve, the division suffered its first casualty of the battle due to German artillery fire. The 1 July attack was a disaster on the Fourth Army front, and total British losses amounted to 57,470 largely north of the Albert–Bapaume road. In particular, <a href="XV%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">XV Corps</a> attacked the villages of <a href="Fricourt">Fricourt</a> and <a href="Mametz%2C%20Somme">Mametz</a>. Throughout the day, the <a href="7th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">7th Division</a> assaulted and captured Mametz. The <a href="21st%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">21st Division</a> pushed into the German lines and flanked Fricourt to the north. Due to this move and the capture of Mametz, the Germans abandoned Fricourt; the two divisions advanced up to and suffered 7,500 casualties. Between these two villages were the entrenched German positions in Mametz Wood. These needed to be captured to allow XV Corps to advance further into German territory. More ground was gained in subsequent attacks, but German defences and rain hindered moves to clear Mametz Wood. Following casualties within the 7th Division, the 38th (Welsh) Division was attached to XV Corps to relieve the division and clear the wood.
Mametz Wood was defended by elements of the German <a href="Lehr%20Infantry%20Regiment">Lehr Infantry Regiment</a> and <a href="17th%20Reserve%20Division%20%28German%20Empire%29">163rd Infantry Regiment</a>. These units were entrenched within the wood; the German second line was only behind, allowing the position to be reinforced easily. From 6–9 July, the 38th Division conducted reconnaissance and probing attacks, to determine the strength of the German position.

On 7 July, the division launched two <a href="battalion">battalion</a>s upon the wood after a brief preliminary bombardment. At 08:00, the 16th Welsh and 10th SWB attacked. As soon as the advance began it became obvious that the preliminary bombardment had failed to silence the German <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a> positions and German shells started to fall upon the attackers and the trenches they had left, resulting in a temporary communication breakdown. Caught between machine gun fire from their front <a href="Enfilade%20and%20defilade">and their flanks</a>, the attack bogged down within of the wood. Unable to move further, the troops were ordered to dig in to await a renewed British bombardment. At 11:00 the troops tried again but were unable to push further forward. A proposed third attack in the afternoon was called off. The 16th Welsh Battalion historian wrote that "'[c]ut to Ribbons' would be an apt description" as casualties amounted to 276 men. The 10th SWB suffered 180 casualties.

During the evening, the 14th RWF launched a minor trench raid. On 8 July, this was supposed to develop into an attack on the southern tip of the wood. While the division prepared to launch a battalion-sized attack, XV Corps commander <a href="Lieutenant%20General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Henry%20Horne%2C%201st%20Baron%20Horne">Henry Horne</a> ordered a smaller attack by a <a href="platoon">platoon</a>. The day was spent in confusion; conflicting orders were issued and Horne travelled to the division to clarify his intentions. In the end, no attack was launched.

When Horne found out that the 14th RWF had not moved and that their attack had been pushed back to 8 July, he summoned Ivor Philipps to Corps Headquarters and sacked him. <a href="General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">General</a> <a href="Douglas%20Haig%2C%201st%20Earl%20Haig">Douglas Haig</a>, commander of the BEF, noted this event in his diary. He wrote: "visited HQ XV Corps and saw General Horne. He was very disappointed with the work of the ... 38th Welsh Div". Haig further commented that Philipps was relieved of his command as the majority of the division had "never entered" the woods despite the "most adequate ... bombard[ment]", had suffered "under 150 casualties" during their attack and that: "a few bold men [who had] entered the Wood found little opposition". Historian Don Farr wrote that Haig's entries are at odds with the facts and that he relied heavily on what Horne had told him. Farr states that Horne's account to Haig was self-serving, did no justice "to the difficulties confronting the troops on the ground", and did not acknowledge the failure of the bombardment. He also suggests that the sacking of Philipps may have been political, by a distrusting <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">officer</a> corps towards a perceived political appointee.

Hughes quoted a regular officer who was attached to the division who described Philipps as "an excellent administrator" who was "valued [for] his service with the division". Historian Tim Travers wrote that "perhaps Philipps was a poor commander" but the opening attacks on Mametz Wood demonstrated the faults of the entire command structure, not just of Philipps, as there was pressure from the top down to get results. Farr wrote that "there is evidence that ... Philipps ... balked at sending waves of [his] men unprotected against machine guns" and Travers wrote that Philipps had shown moral courage in cancelling unprepared attacks and for giving his troops "instructions not to press the attack if machine-gun fire was met". Horne had intended to replace Philipps with Major-General <a href="Charles%20Blackader">Charles Blackader</a> but was overruled by Haig who ordered that <a href="Herbert%20Watts">Herbert Watts</a>, commander of the 7th Division, was to take temporary command. During 9 July, the decision was made that the division would launch a full-scale attack the next day. At 03:30 on 10 July, the preliminary bombardment began.
The initial <a href="bombardment">bombardment</a> lasted for 45 minutes, striking the German front line positions; the shelling was also temporarily halted to attempt to lure the German defenders back into the front line. At 04:15, the division launched its attack. Advancing behind a <a href="Barrage%20%28artillery%29%23moving%20barrage">creeping barrage</a> were the 13th Welsh (on the right flank), the 14th Welsh (in the centre) and the 16th RWF (on the left flank). A <a href="smoke%20screen">smoke screen</a> had been laid down on either flank, which succeeded in drawing German fire away from the assault. The divisional history called this attack "one of the most magnificent sights of the war ... wave after wave of men were seen advancing without hesitation and without a break over a distance which in some places was nearly 500 yards".

The 14th Welsh rapidly entered the wood and cleared the German positions with <a href="bayonets">bayonets</a> and rifle fire. In the face of determined German resistance and flanking machine gun fire, the 13th Welsh suffered many casualties and their attack stalled. The division reinforced the right flank by committing the 15th Welsh who were able to push through into the wood. Before they could link up and aid the 13th, German troops infiltrated the gap between the two battalions, got behind the 15th Welsh and almost wiped out a company. These troops had to fight their way out, and just seven returned . Despite the losses, the three battalions of the Welsh regiment were able to form a cohesive line defending the edge of the wood and repulsed strong German counter-attacks. The 16th RWF, which had fallen behind the creeping barrage, were met with determined German resistance which repulsed two assaults. The 15th RWF was sent to reinforce and both battalions were then able to push their way into the wood where German resistance, including a machine gun, prevented a further advance.

The 10th Welsh moved up to cover the gap between the five battalions already engaged and the 13th RWF were deployed to clear the German position in front of their sister battalions; divisional engineers arrived to dig trenches and lay wire. During the afternoon, the 10th SWB and 17th RWF were committed to the wood. At 16:00, another attack began and met with little resistance. The 10th SWB captured the eastern stretches of the wood and inflicted many casualties on the Germans. The 15th Welsh, along with the 15th and 17th RWF, fought north through the wood and made it to within of the northern edge when they were thrown back by German fire. A further attack during the evening was called off and the troops were pulled back up to and ordered to dig in for the night.
During the night, the 113th and 114th Infantry Brigades were ordered out of the wood and the 115th Brigade assembled in their place. The next day, the 115th Brigade prepared an assault to clear out the Germans. The 115th Brigade's commanding officer, Brigadier-General H. J. Evans, wanted to launch a surprise attack but was overruled. The subsequent bombardment to support the attack fell short in places, hitting British troops and provoking German artillery fire. As well as the <a href="friendly%20fire">friendly fire</a>, the barrage also caught German troops in the open as they fled from the wood. The remaining Germans offered determined resistance and the 16th Welsh were held up by machine gun fire and the use of a <a href="flamethrower">flamethrower</a>. Despite this, the brigade was able to clear Mametz Wood by the end of the day. The German second line position was on higher ground which dominated the edge of the wood and, coupled with artillery fire, resulted in the brigade pulling back to its start line to avoid further casualties.
That evening, the 21st Division relieved the 38th Division who moved near <a href="Gommecourt%2C%20Pas-de-Calais">Gommecourt</a> and relieved the <a href="48th%20%28South%20Midland%29%20Division">48th (South Midland) Division</a>. On 12 July, Watts returned to the 7th Division and Blackader assumed command of the 38th. The division had suffered 3,993 casualties during the six days it had fought on the Somme, with over 600 men killed. Although it had captured 400 prisoners and Mametz Wood (the largest wood on the Somme), paving the way for the assault on <a href="Battle%20of%20Bazentin%20Ridge">Bazentin Ridge</a>, the reputation of the division had been further hindered by inaccuracies. The failure of the first attack harmed the division's reputation, as the comparably few casualties were seen as evidence of a lack of determination by the men. The 113th Brigade's commander, Brigadier-General <a href="Llewelyn%20Alberic%20Emilius%20Price-Davies">Price-Davies</a>, made things worse by reporting panic among the men and refusals of orders. Price-Davies later wrote: "I may not have given my brigade full credit for what they did", but the damage had been done. The difficulty of wood fighting was not appreciated at the time, and Farr wrote that the reputation of the division suffered due to the repeated interference by Horne in matters best left to the divisional or brigade staff and his "inexperience of battlefield command at this level".

At the end of August 1916, the division was deployed to the <a href="Ypres%20Salient">Ypres Salient</a> where it remained for the next ten months seeing no major action. The division spent its time rebuilding and consolidating washed out trenches and raiding German positions. For the former, the division was commended by their Corps commander <a href="Rudolph%20Lambart%2C%2010th%20Earl%20of%20Cavan">Rudolph Lambart</a> (<a href="XIV%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">XIV Corps</a>). In November, elements of the 14th Welsh launched a large raid on a German position known as High Command Redoubt, a fortified position on a slight rise that overlooked the British lines. From this <a href="redoubt">redoubt</a>, the Germans had been able to direct artillery fire and snipe the British positions. The 14th Welsh raided the position, killing 50 defenders in <a href="hand-to-hand%20combat">hand-to-hand combat</a> and taking 20 more as prisoners.
In June, the division was withdrawn into reserve to conduct training exercises for the Ypres offensive. Replicas of the German positions on Pilckem Ridge were built and attacks rehearsed. On 20 July, the division returned to the front taking over from the <a href="29th%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">29th Division</a>. Until the end of the month, the division was subjected to German artillery fire. These shells, a mixture of high explosive and <a href="Sulfur%20mustard">mustard gas</a>, inflicted serious losses. At the same time, aerial reconnaissance and infantry patrols by the division confirmed that the British preliminary barrage had forced the Germans back to their second line positions.

At 03:50 on 31 July, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pilckem%20Ridge">Battle of Pilckem Ridge</a> began. The division was ordered to capture the German front line, the second line positions based on Pilckem Ridge, a low ridge that also contained the heavily shelled village of Pilckem, followed by Iron Cross Ridge which lay to the east, before storming down the other side and across a small stream known as the Steenbeck. The division would be opposed primarily by the German <a href="3rd%20Guards%20Infantry%20Division%20%28German%20Empire%29">3rd Guards Infantry Division</a>, along with elements of the <a href="3rd%20Reserve%20Division%20%28German%20Empire%29">3rd Reserve Division</a> and <a href="111th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28German%20Empire%29">111th Division</a>, dug-in among trench lines and 280 concrete <a href="Pillbox%20%28military%29">pillboxes</a> and <a href="bunker">bunker</a>s. To secure these various objectives, the division planned to attack in waves, with fresh troops constantly moving forward to tackle the next objective.

Due to the <a href="Royal%20Artillery">Royal Artillery</a> gas bombardments, the German artillery had been largely silenced and played little part in the initial fighting. The 10th and 13th Welsh (advancing on the right) and half the 13th and 16th RWF (on the left), were able to take the German forward positions rapidly, capturing several Germans who had remained behind. The 13th and 14th Welsh then pushed beyond their sister battalions up the ridge, along with the remaining half of the 13th and 16th RWF. Based in the village and Marsouin and Stray Farms, the German resistance was more determined, resulting in increasing British losses. <a href="Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>, in his history of the war, described the scene:

It was during this stage of the fighting that <a href="James%20Llewellyn%20Davies">James Llewellyn Davies</a> earned the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> (VC). Davies, alone, attacked a German machine gun position after previously failed efforts had resulted in numerous British deaths. He killed one German and captured another as well as the gun. Although he was wounded, he then led an attack to kill a sniper who had been harassing his unit. Davies subsequently died of his wounds.

Where concrete bunkers were encountered, the troops worked their way around them, cutting the German troops off and forcing them to surrender. Despite their resistance, the German second line was captured without delay. Half of the 13th and 14th Welsh, along with the 15th RWF, then pushed towards Iron Cross Ridge. German troops holding Rudolphe Farm, in the area allocated to the <a href="51st%20%28Highland%29%20Division">51st (Highland) Division</a> which had not yet advanced as far, were able to fire into the flanks of the advancing troops. A platoon from 15th Welsh was diverted and assaulted the farm, capturing 15 men and killing or scattering the rest, securing the flank of the advance. The 14th Welsh then rushed Iron Cross Ridge and engaged in hand-to-hand combat to seize the position, before pushing on to capture a <a href="Field%20hospital">dressing station</a>. Their charge had resulted in heavy losses, but yielded 78 prisoners and three machine guns. The 15th RWF had fallen behind the protective creeping barrage to their front and came under fire from a German position known as Battery Copse. Despite many losses, they pushed forward and were able to secure their portion of Iron Cross Ridge.
With Iron Cross Ridge in British hands, the 11th SWB and 17th RWF pushed forward for the Steenbeck. Despite German resistance, based in more concrete defences, these positions were cleared and the river reached, and the two battalions dug-in on the opposite side. Helping to clear German positions during the advance, resulted in <a href="Ivor%20Rees">Ivor Rees</a> being awarded the VC. Rees silenced one German machine gun position, before going on to clear a concrete bunker with grenades resulting in the death of five Germans and the surrender of 30 more and the capture of a machine gun. Due to the casualties taken, elements of the 16th Welsh and 10th SWB were moved forward to reinforce the newly gained position. At 15:10, the German infantry launched a counter-attack. Fighting continued throughout the day, with the forward British battalions forced to pull back beyond the Steenbeck; German attempts to retake further territory were thwarted. During the afternoon, heavy rain began to fall and did so for three days, hindering future operations. The fighting broke the 3rd Guards Division, which the Welsh divisional history notes "had to be withdrawn immediately after the battle". During the day, the division took nearly 700 prisoners. Conan Doyle places the division's losses at 1,300 men. Other than an exchange of artillery fire, no further fighting took place and the division was withdrawn from the line on 6 August.

Historian Toby Thacker wrote that "the attack on the Pilckem Ridge was considered a great success by Haig and has been similarly viewed by historians". He continues: "in Haig's eyes the Welsh Division had redeemed its reputation after what he had perceived as its poor showing at Mametz Wood". Haig went on to write that the division had "achieved the highest level of soldierly achievement". Historian Steven John wrote that the division "regained the honour which it had unjustly lost after their supposed tardiness in the capture of Mametz".

The division returned to the front line on 20 August. On 27 August, elements of the division attacked. Throughout the day, heavy rain had fallen saturating the ground. The divisional history described the scene: "the men who had been lying in shell-holes which were gradually filling with water found great difficulty in getting out and advancing and keeping up with the barrage". As the infantry waded through mud, they lost the creeping barrage. Elements of the division reached the German line, in what the historian of the 16 Welsh called "a gallant but hopeless endeavour". The division remained on the line, subjected to German artillery bombardments, until it was withdrawn on 13 September to take up new positions at <a href="Armenti%C3%A8res">Armentières</a>.

Until early 1918, the division manned various sections of the front line, at times occupying as much as ten miles of the front. During this period, the division worked to improve the trenches they inherited and conducted raids on the German lines. On the night of 7/8 November, the 10th SWB conducted a 300-strong raid on the German lines. Having penetrated into German territory, the battalion destroyed three concrete dugouts, inflicted at least 50 casualties and took 15 prisoners, for a loss of 50 casualties. In addition to raiding, the division helped train the newly arrived <a href="1st%20Division%20%28Portugal%29">1st Portuguese Division</a> by having a battalion assigned one at a time for tutoring. During the winter, the British realised that the Germans intended to begin an offensive in 1918 (the <a href="Spring%20Offensive">Spring Offensive</a>) and the division spent the following months improving the front line positions, as well as constructing rear-line defences from the Armentières region to the northern bank of <a href="Leie">River Lys</a>, laying what the divisional history described as an: "inconceivable amount of concrete and barbed wire".
By 1918, the number of front line infantry within the British Army in France had decreased, leading to a manpower crisis. In an attempt to consolidate manpower and to increase the number of machine guns and artillery support available to the infantry, the number of battalions in a division was cut from twelve to nine. This had the effect of reducing the establishment of a division from 18,825 men to 16,035. In addition, to ease reinforcement, an attempt was made to consolidate as many battalions from the same regiment within the same brigade. These changes impacted the division, resulting in the 15th RWF, 11th SWB and 10th and 16th Welsh being disbanded and the 2nd RWF joining from the <a href="33rd%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">33rd Division</a>. These changes to the division also saw the machine gun companies consolidated into a single battalion, one medium mortar battery broken up and absorbed by the remaining two batteries and the heavy mortar battery leaving the division to become a Corps asset.

After a short break to train and rest, the division returned to the front line in mid-February and recommenced raiding the German lines. On 15 March, the 16th RWF conducted a raid on a similar scale, and with similar success, to the one conducted by the 10th SWB in November. During the same period, the Germans raided the British lines but managed to capture only two men. In addition, the division's snipers were able to gain the upper hand over their German rivals. The divisional history notes that its patrols had gained "control of No Man's Land". Using what had been learned "thorough previous reconnaissance", in addition to sniping, it was "possible to move about unmolested in exposed trenches or even in the open" in front of the German lines.

On 21 March, Germany launched <a href="Operation%20Michael">Operation Michael</a>. This attack, which became the opening salvo of their Spring Offensive, aimed to deliver a single, decisive, war winning blow. The Germans intended to strike the southern British flank, to separate the British and French armies and then move north to engage the bulk of the British forces in France in a (<a href="battle%20of%20annihilation">battle of annihilation</a>). The aim was to inflict such a defeat upon the British armies that the country would abandon the war, which in turn would force the French to sue for peace. After the first ten days of the German offensive, the casualties suffered by the <a href="2nd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">2nd</a> and the <a href="47th%20%281/2nd%20London%29%20Division">47th (London)</a> Divisions were such that the 38th was ordered south to take up positions near <a href="Albert%2C%20Somme">Albert</a> to relieve the two formations. The infantry moved south, and the divisional artillery remained at Armentières to support the <a href="34th%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">34th Division</a> and subsequently took part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Lys%20%281918%29">Battle of the Lys</a>. During this battle, the artillery went on to aid French forces before being transferred temporarily to the British <a href="25th%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">25th Division</a> and conducting a fighting withdrawal. Its actions with both divisions earned the men of the divisional artillery plaudits from both divisional commanders.

Near Albert, the division had been kept in reserve until the night 11/12 April, when the division relieved the <a href="12th%20%28Eastern%29%20Division">12th (Eastern) Division</a>. The Germans had captured high ground near <a href="Bouzincourt">Bouzincourt</a> and <a href="Aveluy">Aveluy</a>, overlooking the British lines. The division was ordered to retake this to deny the Germans the ability to observe the British positions and to gain observation positions overlooking the German lines in the <a href="Ancre">Ancre valley</a>. At 19:30 on 22 April, elements of the 113th and 115th Brigades attacked with support from <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Artillery">Australian artillery</a>. The German infantry, supported by a large number of machine guns and much artillery support, resisted the attack. Unable to drive the German infantry off all of the high ground, the division gained on a front, which achieved the objective. The 13th RWF managed to push further ahead and secured a section of high ground overlooking the German lines, fought off several German counter-attacks and took captive and six machine guns. The attack was costly, with the 13th RWF suffering over 400 wounded. The Germans made repeated attempts to push back the British and a big attack was repulsed on 9 May. The division attempted an abortive attack on another German-held ridge and conducted several raids on the German lines, before they were withdrawn for a short break on 20 May.

At this point, Major-General Charles Blackader left the division on medical grounds and was replaced by Major-General <a href="Thomas%20Cubitt%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Thomas Cubitt</a>. The division received replacements for casualties, disbanded the sniper company and engaged in rifle training. Once back on the line, the division returned to its previous routine of static warfare: conducting patrols and raids, as well as being subjected to raids and artillery bombardments.

The division returned to the front, on 5 August, and took up position at Aveluy Wood. Shortly after, the Allied armies launched the <a href="Battle%20of%20Amiens%20%281918%29">Battle of Amiens</a>, which led to the start of the <a href="Hundred%20Days%20Offensive">Hundred Days Offensive</a>, the culminating offensive of the war. In the 38th Division sector, the Fourth Army pushed the Germans back from their gains and onto the eastern bank of the Ancre. The 38th Division was assigned to cross the river and clear the German-held <a href="Thiepval">Thiepval</a> ridge north of Albert.

On 21/22 August, elements of the 114th Brigade crossed the Ancre near <a href="Beaumont-Hamel">Beaumont-Hamel</a>, established a bridgehead, constructed a bridge and fought off German counter-attacks. The next day, further elements of the brigade crossed, securing a further bridgehead and repulsed more German attacks. The 113th Brigade crossed the river via bridges in Albert and assaulted Unsa Hill to the north-east, taking 194 prisoners, three artillery pieces and seven machine guns. The 115th Brigade crossed the river and cleared several German positions facing them, took at least 30 prisoners and captured 15 machine guns. The rest of the division crossed the following day, either wading or using the new bridges. During the early hours, the 114th Brigade launched an attack on Thiepval ridge while the other two brigades attacked <a href="Ovillers-la-Boisselle">Ovillers-la-Boisselle</a>. By the end of the day, in heavy fighting, the division had seized the ridge, pushed the Germans back around Ovillers and taken 634 prisoners. The division history also records the capture of "143 machine guns".

The division then advanced across the old Somme battlefield, as part of the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20the%20Somme%20%281918%29">Second Battle of the Somme</a>. On 25 August, the 113th Brigade cleared Mametz Wood, and the 115th seized <a href="Bazentin">Bazentin le Petit</a>. The following day, the 113th Brigade reached the outskirts of <a href="Longueval">Longueval</a>. During the fighting, <a href="Henry%20Weale">Henry Weale</a> was ordered to suppress German machine gun positions with his <a href="Lewis%20Gun">Lewis Gun</a>. The gun jammed, and on his own initiative he rushed the German position killing the crew before charging another that resulted in the German crew fleeing. His actions, which earned him the VC, helped the brigade secure its position. The brigade then fought off numerous counter-attacks while the 115th Brigade surrounded and cleared High Wood (near Bazentin le Petit). Divisional casualties amounted to around 800, and at least 100 prisoners were taken along with the capture of 15 machine guns. The next day saw heavy fighting outside Longueval as the 113th and 114th Brigades attempted to advance, but they were halted by determined German resistance and repeated counter-attacks. The following days saw an exchange of artillery fire and further German counter-attacks repulsed. Longueval was seized late on 28 August after a partial German withdrawal. The division continued its advance, overcame German resistance and counter-attacks to capture <a href="Ginchy">Ginchy</a>, Deville Wood and <a href="Lesb%C5%93ufs">Lesbœufs</a> but were held up by determined resistance at <a href="Morval">Morval</a>. Following a day-long barrage, Morval was captured on 1 September after heavy fighting and the division pushed on to take <a href="Sailly-Saillisel">Sailly-Saillisel</a> and <a href="%C3%89tricourt-Manancourt">Étricourt-Manancourt</a>. In an effort to halt the British advance, the Germans had dug in on the far side of the <a href="Canal%20du%20Nord">Canal du Nord</a> and, in the words of the divisional history, "smothered the Canal valley with gas shells". On 3 September, having noticed a weakness in the German positions, elements of the 13th and 14th Welsh stormed across the canal and cleared the eastern bank allowing the rest of the 114th Brigade to cross. On 5 September, the division was relieved and placed in reserve. During August and the beginning of September, the artillery had fired over 300,000 rounds in support of the fighting, 3,614 casualties had been suffered and 1,915 German prisoners taken.

On 11 September, the division returned to the line near <a href="Gouzeaucourt">Gouzeaucourt</a>; the Germans had dug in along a ridge line from <a href="%C3%89pehy">Épehy</a> to <a href="Trescault">Trescault</a> intending to delay the British from reaching the <a href="Hindenburg%20Line">Hindenburg Line</a>. The Fourth Army was tasked with clearing these positions. On 18 September, the <a href="Battle%20of%20%C3%89pehy">Battle of Épehy</a> was fought. The division attacked at 05:40 with the 113th and 114th Brigades. For his role during the assault, <a href="William%20Allison%20White">William Allison White</a> earned the VC. Alone, he assaulted a machine gun post that was hindering the advance, killing the defenders and capturing the gun. He then launched a second attack, accompanied by two others who were killed, to seize another German machine gun position killing a further five and again capturing the gun. In a third action, White led a small group to overwhelm a German defensive position that was also holding up the advance. He proceeded to organise the defence of the position, and fought off a German counterattack with heavy losses using captured machine guns. Both brigades were able to reach their objectives despite flanking fire, and fought off numerous counter-attacks. Despite this, the Germans were able to cling on to Gouzeaucourt. The battle cleared the German outposts in front of the Hindenburg Line, preparing the way for future operations. On 20 September, the division was pulled off the line for a period of rest.

Eight days later, the division returned in preparation for assaulting the Hindenburg Line. The division advanced, along with the Fourth Army, pressing the retreating Germans before halting at the Hindenburg support line, also known as the <a href="Le%20Catelet">Le Catelet</a>-<a href="Nauroy">Nauroy</a> Line, due to determined German resistance. On 5 October, the line was breached by the division after the Germans evacuated it for their main position (Siegfried II Stellung, otherwise known as the <a href="Masni%C3%A8res">Masnières</a>-<a href="Beaurevoir">Beaurevoir</a> line) near <a href="Villers-Outr%C3%A9aux">Villers-Outréaux</a>. The German positions lay behind dense lines of barbed wire, supported by concrete pillboxes and machine gun positions hidden in small woods providing excellent fields of fire over otherwise open countryside. Faced with this level of defence, the division was halted and spent the following days reconnoitring the German positions preparing for an assault.

The division's plan of attack was for the 115th Brigade to envelop Villers-Outréaux during dark and assault the village during daylight with <a href="tank">tank</a> support, while the 113th Brigade would clear the nearby Mortho Wood. The 114th Brigade would be held in reserve initially but brought up to exploit the success and push deeper into the German defensive belt. At 01:00 on 8 October, the attack began. The initial attack by the 115th Brigade failed, in turn impeding the 113th Brigade, which was unable to approach Mortho Wood due to concentrated German machine gun fire. It was during this first attack, that <a href="Jack%20Williams%20%28VC%29">Jack Williams</a> earned his VC. Elements of the 10th SWB had come under heavy German machine gun fire and suffered numerous casualties. Williams directed a Lewis gunner to suppress the German position, while he assaulted it single-handedly. Rushing the position, he took the surrender of 15 Germans. When they realised Williams was alone they attempted to kill him and re-man their positions. After a brief clash, in which five Germans were bayoneted, the survivors again surrendered to Williams. In silencing the position, he alleviated the danger to his unit and allowed the battalion to resume the advance. The entire 115th Brigade soon rallied, and achieved their initial objective while the 113th were able to gain a foothold near theirs. At 05:00, the 2nd RWF – following a friendly fire incident – assaulted Villers-Outréaux and cleared the village with tank support. At 08:00, the 114th Brigade was committed to the battle as orders to delay the advance arrived late. The troops were held up by undetected barbed wire and heavy German fire until 11:30, when they disengaged and pressed forward exploiting the success of the 115th Brigade. The divisional history commented that the attack "progressed rapidly and resulted in a complete rout of the enemy" and that the brigade was able to achieve its final objective on the <a href="Pr%C3%A9mont">Prémont</a>–<a href="Esnes">Esnes</a> road. Meanwhile, the 113th Brigade engaged in heavy fighting to clear the German trenches around Mortho Wood. During this action, the division suffered 1,290 casualties and took 380 prisoners. The divisional history noted that 8 October was "perhaps ... the stiffest fighting of the whole advance".

After the assault, the 33rd Division pursued the retreating German forces, while the 38th stayed close behind ready to take over the advance or assault strongly-held German positions as needed. On 9 October, <a href="Clary%2C%20Nord">Clary</a> was liberated and the next day the divisional artillery was firing in support of the 33rd which had made contact with German forces. Over the next few days, the 33rd Division pursued the Germans to the River <a href="Selle">Selle</a> and launched a bloody assault on the defended eastern bank during the opening stages of the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Selle">Battle of the Selle</a>. While a bridgehead was secured, it was abandoned due to losses and the 38th Division was moved forward. On the night of 13/14 October, the division took over the line near <a href="Troisvilles">Troisvilles</a> and <a href="Bertry">Bertry</a>. Over the next six days, the division prepared itself: conducting reconnaissance, constructing bridges and moving up heavy artillery. During these preparations, the Germans bombarded elements of the division's artillery with gas shells.

On the night of 19/20 October, the division attacked. The footbridges were brought forward and the river crossed with ease but, the divisional history commented, the "railway embankment on the far side was a much greater natural obstacle" due to heavy rain and was "heavily wired" and defended. The 113th and 114th Brigades crossed the river, each supported by a tank, while the 115th was held in reserve to deal with German counter-attacks. Despite heavy German resistance and the tanks becoming bogged down in mud, the troops were able to seize the rail line by 02:30. The divisional history commended the 14th Welsh for their efforts during this action, the first to secure a bridgehead and then rolling up the German line to secure the right flank of the attack. Major-General Cubitt described the attack: having "formed up in boggy ground, [the men] crossed a difficult river (for the fourth time since 21st August), attacked up a <a href="glacis">glacis</a> swept by machine gun fire, stormed a precipitous railway embankment 40 to 50 feet high and in pouring rain, very slippery and deep going, in the hours of darkness, established [themselves] on the final objective". Elements of the division's pioneers joined in the assault on the heights beyond the river and aided in the capture of the position. Despite several counter-attacks, the division held the high ground. The attack inflicted at least 225 casualties and resulted in the capture of 212 prisoners, a battery of artillery pieces and mortars.

With a bridgehead across the Selle secured, the 33rd Division (again supported by the 38th's artillery) continued the advance with the 38th close behind. During this time, elements of the division supply train were stricken by an <a href="1918%20flu%20pandemic">outbreak of Spanish flu</a>. Following the 33rd, the division passed through the village of Forest, <a href="Croix-Caluyau">Croix-Caluyau</a> and <a href="Englefontaine">Englefontaine</a>, before halting in front of the <a href="For%C3%AAt%20de%20Mormal">Forêt de Mormal</a>. Here the division paused until 4 November and was subjected to artillery and aerial bombardments as well as minor skirmishes with German infantry. At 06:15 on 4 November, over a front, the 115th Brigade pushed forward subjected to a heavy German artillery bombardment. The brigade cleared fenced-off <a href="orchards">orchards</a> before pushing into the forest against stiff resistance. They were followed by the 113th Brigade, who then leapfrogged ahead to achieve the division's second objective inside the forest. A lull in the fighting followed as the artillery was moved forward. Afterwards, the 114th Brigade attacked reaching the division's final objective, a road running through the forest, before nightfall. In heavy rain and complete darkness, the 13th Welsh carried on the advance. They surrounded the hamlets of <a href="Sarbaras">Sarbaras</a> and <a href="Tete%20Noir">Tete Noir</a>, capturing a garrison of 65 men, before pushing on towards <a href="Berliamont">Berliamont</a> and taking 60 more prisoners. The division had breached the forest, allowing the 33rd Division to continue again advancing eastwards – this time to cross the <a href="Sambre">Sambre</a>. During this 24-hour period, the division had advanced , further than the flanking divisions, taken 522 prisoners, captured 23 artillery pieces and suffered at least 411 casualties.

On 7 November, the division relieved the 33rd in the pursuit of the Germans. Taking over the line near <a href="Dourlers">Dourlers</a>, the division pushed east. By 11:00 on 11 November, the leading brigade was east of <a href="Dimechaux">Dimechaux</a> with advanced patrols in contact with German forces at <a href="Hestrud">Hestrud</a> on the Belgian border. From the start of the Hundred Day Offensive until the signing of the armistice on 11 November, the division had advanced , taken 3,102 prisoners, seized 520 machine guns and captured 50 mortars and 43 artillery pieces. The division's own losses during this period amounted to 8,681 men.

Historian <a href="Gary%20Sheffield%20%28historian%29">Gary Sheffield</a> commented that, since the division was "employed on trench-holding duties from September 1917 to July 1918", it likely "was not regarded by GHQ as an elite 'storm' formation". He noted, "judged by the results of their attacks during the Hundred Days" the division "was in a select band of elite divisions" akin to the <a href="Australian%20Corps">Australian</a>, <a href="Canadian%20Corps">Canadian</a> and a limited number of other British formations. Sheffield credited Cubitt, "a hard-bitten, ruthless 'fire-eater'", for the improved performance of the division during this period, along with the various breaks the division had away from the line when they were able to train and assimilate new knowledge that resulted in "devolution of command" which allowed command flexibility among lower ranks. In addition, Sheffield cited improved staff work and tactical <a href="doctrine">doctrine</a> and high <a href="morale">morale</a>, which had led to the ability of the division to carry out effective <a href="combined%20arms">combined arms</a> operations.

After the conclusion of fighting, the division was based around <a href="Aulnoye-Aymeries">Aulnoye-Aymeries</a> in France. The division was not chosen to be part of the <a href="British%20Army%20of%20the%20Rhine">British Army of the Rhine</a>, the British occupation force to be <a href="Occupation%20of%20the%20Rhineland">based in the Rhineland</a>. Instead, it was demobilised over a period of months. The first 3,000 soldiers were sent home during December, and the division ceased to exist by March 1919. Prior to the division's disbandment, the remaining men were visited by <a href="Edward%20VIII">Edward</a> <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a> (later Edward VIII).

During the course of the war, 4,419 of the division's men were killed, 23,268 were wounded, and 1,693 reported missing. For acts of valour, five soldiers were (in some instances posthumously) awarded the Victoria Cross. In addition, the following awards (in several cases, multiple times) were bestowed: 86 <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a>s, 447 <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a>es, 254 <a href="Distinguished%20Conduct%20Medal">Distinguished Conduct Medal</a>s, and 1,150 <a href="Military%20Medal">Military Medal</a>s; 453 men were mentioned in dispatches.

The practice of wearing battalion specific insignia (often called battle patches) in the B.E.F. began in mid 1915 with the arrival of units of Kitchener's Armies and was widespread after the Somme Battles of 1916. The patches shown were adopted by the division during late 1917, and were designed to a brigade scheme of a simple shape for each brigade and a colour for the battalion (the colours and design changed for the 115th brigade). Originally worn at the top of both sleeves, the battle patch was retained on the left when the division sign began to be worn on the right.

Throughout the 1930s, <a href="Causes%20of%20World%20War%20II">tensions built</a> between <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Germany</a> and the United Kingdom as well as its <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">allies</a>. During late 1937 and throughout 1938, German demands for the annexation of Czechoslovakia's <a href="Sudetenland">Sudetenland</a> led to an <a href="international%20crisis">international crisis</a>. In an attempt to avoid war, British <a href="Prime%20Minister%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Neville%20Chamberlain">Neville Chamberlain</a> met with German <a href="Chancellor%20of%20Germany">Chancellor</a> <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> in September and brokered the <a href="Munich%20Agreement">Munich Agreement</a>. The agreement averted immediate war and allowed Germany to annex the Sudetenland. Chamberlain had intended the agreement to lead to further peaceful resolution of issues, but relations between both countries soon deteriorated. On 15 March 1939, Germany breached the terms of the agreement by invading and occupying the <a href="Protectorate%20of%20Bohemia%20and%20Moravia">remnants of the Czech state</a>.

In response, on 29 March, the British Secretary of State for War <a href="Leslie%20Hore-Belisha%2C%201st%20Baron%20Hore-Belisha">Leslie Hore-Belisha</a> announced plans to increase the <a href="Army%20Reserve%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Territorial Army</a> from 130,000 men to 340,000 and in so doing double the number of territorial divisions. The plan of action was for the existing units to recruit over their allowed establishments (aided by an increase in pay for territorials, the removal of restrictions on promotion that had been a major hindrance to recruiting during the preceding years, the construction of better quality barracks and an increase in supper-time rations) and then form Second Line divisions from small cadres that could be built upon. As a result, the 38th (Welsh) Infantry Division was to be created as a Second Line unit, a duplicate of the First Line <a href="53rd%20%28Welsh%29%20Infantry%20Division">53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division</a>. In April, limited <a href="conscription">conscription</a> was introduced. At that time 34,500 militiamen, all aged 20, were conscripted into the regular army, initially to be trained for six months before being deployed to the forming second line units. Despite the intention for the army to grow in size, the programme was complicated by a lack of central guidance on the expansion and duplication process and issues regarding the lack of facilities, equipment and instructors.

It was envisioned that the duplicating process and recruiting the required numbers of men would take no more than six months. Some TA divisions had made little progress by the time the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> began; others were able to complete this work within a matter of weeks. The 38th (Welsh) Infantry Division became active on 18 September 1939; its constituent units had already formed and had been administered by the 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division. The 38th was again composed of the 113th, 114th and 115th Infantry Brigades, and was placed under the initial command of Major-General <a href="Geoffrey%20Raikes">Geoffrey Raikes</a>.

In May, Major-General <a href="A.%20E.%20Williams">A. E. Williams</a> assumed command. The division was initially assigned to <a href="Western%20Command%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Western Command</a>, and by early 1940 was spread out along the <a href="River%20Severn">River Severn</a> in England and Wales. By summer, the division was under the command of <a href="III%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">III Corps</a> and was based in <a href="North%20West%20England">North West England</a>, around Liverpool, to conduct manoeuvres and training.

The war-time deployment of the Territorial Army envisioned it being deployed piecemeal, to reinforce the regular army already deployed to the European mainland, as equipment became available. The plan envisioned the deployment of the whole force in waves, as divisions completed their training, with the final divisions being deployed a year after the outbreak of war. As a result, the division did not leave the United Kingdom as the <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20II%29">British Expeditionary Force</a> was <a href="Dunkirk%20evacuation">evacuated from France</a> during May and June 1940. On 28 October, Major-General <a href="Noel%20Irwin">Noel Irwin</a>, who had commanded the <a href="2nd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">2nd Infantry Division</a> during the latter stages of the fighting in France, was given command of the 38th.

In April 1941, the division was assigned to <a href="IV%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">IV Corps</a> and had moved to <a href="Sussex">Sussex</a>, the <a href="18th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">18th Infantry Division</a> having replaced them around Liverpool. In Sussex, the division was held in reserve and placed behind the 47th (London) Infantry Division and the <a href="55th%20%28West%20Lancashire%29%20Infantry%20Division">55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division</a> which were defending the coast between <a href="Bognor%20Regis">Bognor Regis</a> – in the west – to <a href="Beachy%20Head">Beachy Head</a> in the east. Michael Glover and Jonathan Riley note that while in reserve, the Royal Welch Fusiliers battalions of the 115th Brigade took part in coastal defence duties.

On 15 November 1941, Major-General <a href="Arthur%20Dowler">Arthur Dowler</a> took command of the division. On 1 December 1941, the division was placed on the Lower Establishment, having been earmarked for a static home defence role. During 1942, the division was assigned to <a href="V%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">V Corps</a> and had shifted west to defend the <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a> coastline. On 27 and 28 February, the anti-aircraft platoon of the 4th Battalion, <a href="Monmouthshire%20Regiment">Monmouthshire Regiment</a>, supported <a href="Operation%20Biting">Operation Biting</a>, the commando raid on <a href="Saint-Jouin-Bruneval">Bruneval</a>, France. On 23 April 1942, Major-General <a href="D.%20C.%20Butterworth">D. C. Butterworth</a> was given command of the division. In July, the division lost the <a href="6th%20%28Royal%20Welch%29%20Parachute%20Battalion">10th Royal Welch Fusiliers</a> to the <a href="Parachute%20Regiment%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Parachute Regiment</a>. The division spent 1943 and early 1944 moving around the country spending time in <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a> and <a href="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>, and were assigned to II and <a href="XII%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">XII Corps</a>. By March, the 115th Infantry Brigade had formed "'B' Marshalling Area" and was aiding the movement of troops in preparation for <a href="Operation%20Overlord">Operation Overlord</a>.
By 1944, there were five Lower Establishment divisions allocated to home defence duties: the 38th, the <a href="45th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">45th</a>, the 47th (London), the 55th (West Lancashire) and the <a href="61st%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">61st Infantry divisions</a>. These five divisions had a combined total of 17,845 men. Of this number, around 13,000 were available as replacements for the <a href="21st%20Army%20Group">21st Army Group</a> fighting in France. The remaining 4,800 men were considered ineligible for service abroad at that time for a variety of reasons, including a lack of training, or being medically unfit. Over the next six months, up to 75 per cent of these men would be deployed to reinforce 21st Army Group after the completion of their training and certification of fitness. Specifically, the vast majority of the 1st Brecknockshire Battalion, South Wales Borderers were deployed to <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a> at the end of June as replacements to reinforce 21st Army Group, and by mid-July so had the 2nd Battalion, <a href="Herefordshire%20Light%20Infantry">Herefordshire Light Infantry</a>, resulting in that battalion being disbanded. Historian Stephen Hart commented that, by September, the 21st Army Group "had bled <a href="Commander-in-Chief%2C%20Home%20Forces">Home Forces</a> dry of draftable riflemen" after the losses suffered during the Battle of Normandy, leaving the army in Britain, with the exception of the <a href="52nd%20%28Lowland%29%20Infantry%20Division">52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division</a>, with just "young lads, old men and the unfit".

Compounding the loss of men to reinforce 21st Army Group, on 3 July the 115th Infantry Brigade was withdrawn from the division. The brigade was earmarked for <a href="German%20occupation%20of%20the%20Channel%20Islands">an operation to liberate the Channel Islands</a> and was re-designated Force 135. Ultimately such an operation did not take place and the brigade was deployed to mainland Europe. During August, the 38th (Welsh) Infantry Division began to disperse. On 15 August, the divisional headquarters ceased commanding any subordinate units and by the end of the month the division was disbanded.

During 1944, the British Army suffered a severe shortage of manpower. In an effort to downsize the army and consolidate as many men within as few formations as possible to maintain fighting strength and efficiency, the <a href="War%20Office">War Office</a> began disbanding divisions, including the <a href="80th%20Infantry%20%28Reserve%29%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">80th Infantry (Reserve) Division</a>. As part of this restructure, the decision was made to retain division numbers familiar to the British public. On 1 September 1944, the 38th Division was recreated as the 38th Infantry (Reserve) Division to replace the 80th as Western Command's training formation. The new 38th Division was commanded by Major-General <a href="Lionel%20Howard%20Cox">Lionel Howard Cox</a>, who had previously commanded the 80th Division. At this point, the divisional insignia was worn only by the permanent members of the division.

The 38th, along with the 45th Holding, the 47th Infantry (Reserve) and the <a href="48th%20%28South%20Midland%29%20Division">48th Infantry (Reserve) Division</a>, were used to complete the training of new army recruits. At the division, the soldiers were given five weeks of further training at the <a href="Section%20%28military%20unit%29">section</a>, platoon and <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a> level, before undertaking a final three-day <a href="Military%20exercise">exercise</a>. Troops would then be ready to be sent overseas to join other formations.

Undertaking this role, for example, the 5th Battalion, King's Shropshire Light Infantry – between 1944 and 1945 – trained over 4,000 replacements for other battalions within the regiment as well as the <a href="North%20Staffordshire%20Regiment">North Staffordshire Regiment</a>. Having fulfilled its purpose, the division was disbanded at the end of the war.

The division had the following commanders during the First World War:

The division had the following commanders during the Second World War:

St Donat's Castle

St Donat's Castle (), <a href="St%20Donats">St Donats</a>, <a href="Wales">Wales</a>, is a <a href="Middle%20Ages">medieval</a> <a href="castle">castle</a> in the <a href="Vale%20of%20Glamorgan">Vale of Glamorgan</a>, about to the west of <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>, and about to the west of <a href="Llantwit%20Major">Llantwit Major</a>. Positioned on cliffs overlooking the <a href="Bristol%20Channel">Bristol Channel</a>, the site has been occupied since the <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a>, and was by tradition the home of the Celtic chieftain <a href="Caractacus">Caradog</a>. The present castle's origins date from the 12th century when the de Haweys and later <a href="Stradling%20baronets">Peter de Stradling</a> began its development. The Stradlings held the castle for four hundred years, until the death of Sir Thomas Stradling in a duel in 1738.

During the 18th century, the castle's status and condition declined and by the early 19th century it was only partly habitable. The later 19th and early 20th centuries saw several restorations. In 1852, it was purchased by <a href="John%20Whitlock%20Nicholl%20Carne">John Whitlock Nicholl Carne</a>, who claimed descent from the Stradlings but whose efforts at reconstruction were not well regarded. More enlightened improvements were made by its subsequent owner, the coal magnate Morgan Stuart Williams. The castle's transformation occurred after its purchase in 1925 by <a href="William%20Randolph%20Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a>, the American newspaper tycoon. Hearst undertook a "brutal" expansion, including the incorporation of elements from other ancient structures such as the roofs of <a href="Bradenstoke%20Priory">Bradenstoke Priory</a>, Wiltshire and <a href="St%20Botolph%27s%20Church%2C%20Boston">St Botolph's Church</a> in Lincolnshire. His approach to architectural reclamation was controversial and the destruction of Bradenstoke was opposed in a vigorous campaign organised by the <a href="Society%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20Ancient%20Buildings">Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings</a>. <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">Bernard Shaw</a> described the castle after Hearst's reconstruction as "what God would have built if he had had the money".

Despite expending vast sums on St Donat's, Hearst rarely visited and in 1937, with the <a href="Hearst%20Corporation">Hearst Corporation</a> facing financial collapse, the castle was put up for sale. In 1960, some nine years after Hearst's death, it was purchased by the son of the businessman and educational philanthropist <a href="Antonin%20Besse">Antonin Besse</a> and donated to the trustees of <a href="Atlantic%20College">Atlantic College</a>, the first of the <a href="United%20World%20Colleges">United World Colleges</a>. Today the castle is home to some three hundred and fifty international students and, with a history of occupation extending back to the late-13th century, is among the oldest continuously inhabited castles in Wales. Both the castle and the grounds are of historical and architectural importance, and have <a href="listed%20buildings">Grade I listed status</a>.

According to tradition, the site of St Donat's was the place to which <a href="Caractacus">Caradog</a>, the Celtic chieftain, returned after being released from imprisonment in Rome by the emperor <a href="Claudius">Claudius</a>. After the <a href="Norman%20invasion%20of%20Wales">Norman invasion of Wales</a> in the mid-11th century, a timber castle was constructed on the site. The earliest surviving parts of the present castle, the <a href="keep">keep</a> and the inner ward, were built in the late 12th century by the de Hawey family. Ownership passed to the Stradling family through the marriage of Sir Peter Stradling to Joan de Hawey. The Stradlings were adventurers from <a href="Str%C3%A4ttligen">Strättligen</a> in Switzerland, who came to South Wales in the late 13th century. Sir Peter, his wife and later her second husband John de Pembridge, extended the castle around 1300, building the outer gatehouse and <a href="Curtain%20wall%20%28architecture%29">curtain wall</a> and enlarging the keep and inner gatehouse.
The <a href="Stradling%20Baronets">Stradling</a> family served as <a href="Justice%20of%20the%20Peace">magistrates</a>, <a href="members%20of%20parliament">members of parliament</a>, <a href="High%20Sheriff%20of%20Glamorgan">sheriffs</a> and <a href="Lord%20Lieutenant%20of%20Glamorgan">deputy lieutenants</a> of Glamorganshire from the 13th to the 18th centuries. A number achieved more than local fame. The third Sir Edward Stradling, in a run of nine Edwards, fought at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Agincourt">Battle of Agincourt</a>, married a great-granddaughter of <a href="Edward%20III">Edward III</a> and established himself as a powerful landowner and courtier. One of Edward's sons, Henry, was seized by pirates in the <a href="Bristol%20Channel">Bristol Channel</a> while travelling from his Somerset estates to St Donat's, and was released only on payment of a large ransom. This event has subsequently been much embellished by, among others, <a href="Taliesin%20Williams">Taliesin Williams</a> in his account "The Doom of Colyn Dolphyn: A Poem, with Notes Illustrative of Various Traditions of Glamorganshire", which involves the eponymous <a href="Bretons">Breton</a> pirate and the witch <a href="Mallt-y-Nos">Mallt-y-Nos</a>. 
Henry Stradling's nautical misadventures continued; after acceding to the baronetcy, he died of a fever at <a href="Famagusta">Famagusta</a>, returning from a pilgrimage to the <a href="Holy%20Land">Holy Land</a>.

The Stradlings remained adherents of the Catholic faith following the <a href="Reformation">Reformation</a> and experienced persecution as a consequence. Sir <a href="Thomas%20Stradling%20%28MP%29">Thomas Stradling (1495–1571)</a> was imprisoned in the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a> in 1561, following accusations of his having used the appearance of a "miraculous" cross in the trunk of an ash tree on the St Donat's estate to encourage support for the Catholic cause. His son, the scholar <a href="Edward%20Stradling%20%281528/29%E2%80%931609%29">Edward Stradling</a> (1528/9–1609) established a celebrated, and exceptionally large, library at St Donat's which was considered the finest in Wales of its time. The historian Graham Thomas records the Stradling tradition of educating their sons abroad, which led to the library holding extensive collections of foreign-language texts, particularly Italian works. Edward Stradling wrote a history of the area, "The Winning of the Lordship of Glamorgan out of Welshmen's Hands", which established the legend of the <a href="Twelve%20Knights%20of%20Glamorgan">Twelve Knights of Glamorgan</a>, including the inaccurate claim that the first Stradlings had arrived with <a href="William%20the%20Conqueror">William the Conqueror</a>, rather than some 200 years later. He was also the patron of <a href="Si%C3%B4n%20Dafydd%20Rhys">Siôn Dafydd Rhys</a> and funded the production and publication of the latter's "Cambrobrytannicae Cymraecaeve Linguae Institutiones et Rudimenta", the first <a href="Welsh%20language">Welsh language</a> grammar to be published in Latin and thus widely accessible.

During the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a> the Stradlings, prominent <a href="Cavalier">Royalists</a>, supported <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a> and hosted the archbishop <a href="James%20Ussher">James Ussher</a>, when he had to flee Cardiff. Three Stradlings fought at the <a href="Battle%20of%20St%20Fagans">Battle of St Fagans</a> in 1648 and two were forced into exile after the King's execution. After the Civil War, the family declined in importance and ceased to occupy any significant position in the country and, ultimately, within Glamorgan. They retained ownership of St Donat's Castle until the death of Sir Thomas Stradling in a duel in France in 1738. The exact circumstances of his death are uncertain; he was travelling with his university friend Sir John Tyrwhitt, with whom he had reputedly made a pact, each promising the other his inheritance in the event of his death. Sources dispute whether the duel was actually between Stradling and Tyrwhitt, or was contrived by Tyrwhitt. In either event, Stradling was killed and Tyrwhitt inherited his estates.

Under the Tyrwhitts, the castle entered a long decline that lasted over one hundred years. <a href="J.%20M.%20W.%20Turner">J. M. W. Turner</a> sketched the partly-ruinous castle in 1798. <a href="John%20Wesley">John Wesley</a> is reputed to have preached to a crowd of five thousand people on the terraced lawns in 1777. Partial restoration was started by Dr <a href="John%20Whitlock%20Nicholl%20Carne">John Whitlock Nicholl Carne</a>, who claimed to be descended from the Stradlings, and bought the castle from the Tyrwhitt-Drake family in 1862. Carne's reconstructions have not generally been well-regarded; the historian of the castle Alan Hall described the work as being undertaken in an "unscholarly, inauthentic style". A more sympathetic, contemporaneous, account described Carne's efforts as "careful and scrupulous".

Morgan Williams, a colliery owner from <a href="Aberpergwm%20House">Aberpergwm</a> and the owner in the <a href="Edwardian%20era">Edwardian period</a>, from 1901 to 1909, carried out extensive and careful restoration, employing the noted architects <a href="George%20Frederick%20Bodley">George Frederick Bodley</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Garner">Thomas Garner</a>. Williams's sensitive reconstructions were praised by <a href="Henry%20Avray%20Tipping">Henry Avray Tipping</a>, the writer, architect and garden designer. The architectural writer Michael Hall was also impressed, describing Bodley's drawing room as "Edwardian antiquarian taste at its most refined". The process of reconstruction was less harmonious, Williams and Garner rowed constantly and Garner ultimately resigned. Almost all of Bodley and Garner's work was eradicated in the "brutal" remodelling undertaken by William Randolph Hearst. Williams also assembled a collection of arms and armour which was housed at the castle, and made major improvements to the castle's setting, moving the village which previously stood close to the castle's walls to a new location outside of the gates and constructing three entrance lodges. In 1903, the novelist Violet Paget, writing under her pseudonym <a href="Vernon%20Lee">Vernon Lee</a>, used the castle as the model for St Salvat's Castle in her <a href="Gothic%20fiction">Gothic novel</a> "Penelope Brandling: A Tale of the Welsh Coast in the Eighteenth Century". Godfrey Williams, Morgan's son, disliked St Donat's, by tradition on account of its being haunted although this is disputed, and in 1921, having first culled the herd of deer that his father had reintroduced to the park, put the castle up for sale. Its advertisement in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", dated 3 May 1921, described the castle as "a comfortable and liveable old-world home of the first importance". In 1922, it was bought, along with of land, by Richard Pennoyer, an American diplomat married to the <a href="Charles%20Chetwynd-Talbot%2C%2020th%20Earl%20of%20Shrewsbury">Dowager Countess of Shrewsbury</a>. Pennoyer was to own St Donat's for less than three years.

William Randolph Hearst inherited a mining and real estate fortune from his mother, and made a fortune of his own through the establishment of the <a href="Hearst%20Corporation">Hearst Corporation</a>, the largest newspaper and magazine company in the world. Part of the revenues were spent on the building of <a href="Hearst%20Castle">San Simeon</a>, his Spanish-style castle in California, which began construction in 1919. By 1925 he was eager to purchase a genuine castle, and on 13 August he sent a wire to <a href="Alice%20Head">Alice Head</a>, the London-based managing director of his European operations, "Want buy castle in England . St Donat's perhaps satisfactory at proper price. See if you can get right price on St Donat's or any other equally good." Within two months it was Hearst's, or specifically, the property of the <a href="Nat%20Mags">National Magazine Company</a>. The price paid for the castle and of surrounding land was $130,000. Hearst employed <a href="Charles%20Allom">Sir Charles Allom</a> as his architect and designer. Allom was a noted decorator, the founder of White Allom and Company, and had been knighted in 1913 for his redecoration of <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a>.

Hearst attracted strong opinions. <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> called him "an unspeakable blackguard (with) all the worst faults of the corrupt and dissolute monied man". <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, who stayed as Hearst's guest at St Donat's and at San Simeon, described him in a letter to <a href="Clementine%20Churchill">Clementine Churchill</a> as "a grave simple child – with no doubt a nasty temper – playing with the most costly toys ... two magnificent establishments, two charming wives, complete indifference to public opinion, oriental hospitalities". Churchill's mention of "two charming wives" refers to <a href="Marion%20Davies">Marion Davies</a>, Hearst's long-time mistress and a constant presence at both San Simeon and St Donat's. <a href="P.%20G.%20Wodehouse">P. G. Wodehouse</a>, invited to San Simeon, recalled Hearst's way of dealing with over-staying guests: "The longer you are there, the further you get from the middle [of the refectory dining table]. I sat on Marion's right the first night, then found myself being edged further and further away till I got to the extreme end, when I thought it time to leave. Another day, and I should have been feeding on the floor."

Hearst undertook a "rapid and ruthless" redevelopment and rebuilding programme at St Donat’s. He spent large sums renovating the castle with architectural trophies from across the United Kingdom and abroad; at the peak of his buying, Hearst's expenditure accounted for a quarter of the world's entire art market. Alice Head, manager of Hearst's London operations and the actual purchaser of St Donat's, recorded her exhilaration: "We were on top of the wave – out of (one) year's profits, we bought <a href="The%20Connoisseur%20%28magazine%29">"The Connoisseur"</a>, we bought St Donat's and we bought vast quantities of antiques." The writer <a href="Clive%20Aslet">Clive Aslet</a> described Hearst's passion for antiquities as "naked obsession... romance gave way to rape", and his mania for collecting was satirised in <a href="Orson%20Welles">Orson Welles</a>'s 1941 film "<a href="Citizen%20Kane">Citizen Kane</a>". Kane's palace <a href="Xanadu%20%28Citizen%20Kane%29">Xanadu</a>, modelled on San Simeon, is described as containing "A collection of everything, so big that it can never be catalogued or appraised. Enough for ten museums, the loot of the world." Hearst's actions were vigorously opposed, particularly in relation to the destruction of the <a href="Augustinian">Augustinian</a> foundation <a href="Bradenstoke%20Priory">Bradenstoke Priory</a> in Wiltshire. Built in 1142, by the 20th century the priory was in poor repair. Hearst purchased the site in 1929, under conditions of secrecy, and had workmen take down the <a href="cloister">cloister</a>, <a href="tithe%20barn">tithe barn</a>, prior's lodging and <a href="refectory">refectory</a>. Parts were shipped to California; major elements were incorporated into St Donat's as part of the newly created Bradenstoke hall; while other pieces, including the tithe barn, were lost. The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings ran a poster campaign on the <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a>, using text that was considered libellous and which had to be pasted over. The campaign also saw questions on the issue being raised in <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament</a>. Hearst was unconcerned, Miss Head responding to the SPAB secretary: "Mr Hearst and I are well aware of your views. You must please allow us to hold our own opinions." 

Hearst did not visit until September 1928, and even then spent only one night in residence. Having undertaken a night-time tour of the castle which was illuminated by kerosene lamps, he left the following morning to board the <a href="SS%20Imperator">Berengaria</a> for New York. During the voyage home he wrote a 25-page memorandum with instructions for further improvements to the castle. Over the next decade his time at St Donat's amounted to some four months; between his purchase in 1925 and his death in 1951 he visited, normally for a month at the end of his summer European tours, in 1930, 1931, 1934 and, for the last time, in 1936. His infrequent visits were invariably undertaken with a large entourage, whom he sometimes took for drinks to the Old Swan Inn at the nearby village of <a href="Llantwit%20Major">Llantwit Major</a>. Among his guests were the actors <a href="Charlie%20Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a>, <a href="Douglas%20Fairbanks">Douglas Fairbanks</a>, <a href="Errol%20Flynn">Errol Flynn</a> and <a href="Clark%20Gable">Clark Gable</a>, in addition to political luminaries including Winston Churchill, <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a> and a young <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>, who visited with his parents, <a href="Joseph%20P.%20Kennedy%20Sr.">Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.</a> and <a href="Rose%20Kennedy">Rose Kennedy</a>. Visiting writers included <a href="Elinor%20Glyn">Elinor Glyn</a>, <a href="Ivor%20Novello">Ivor Novello</a> and <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">Bernard Shaw</a>. Of St Donat's, Shaw was quoted as saying: "This is what God would have built if he had had the money."

In the late 1930s Hearst's publishing empire came close to collapse. St Donat's was put up for sale in 1937, the Hearst Corporation noting that it had invested £280,000 in the castle through its subsidiary the National Magazine Company. An opinion on the chances of recouping this sum was sought from <a href="James%20Milner%2C%201st%20Baron%20Milner%20of%20Leeds">James Milner</a>, a prominent solicitor and <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Commons%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons</a>. His response was not encouraging: "We have at St Donat's a <a href="white%20elephant">white elephant</a> of the rarest species." <a href="Billy%20Butlin">Billy Butlin</a>, the holiday-camp entrepreneur, was uninterested and a development proposal by <a href="Julian%20Hodge">Sir Julian Hodge</a> did not progress. Much of the furniture, silver and works of art were disposed of in a series of sales conducted by <a href="Christie%27s">Christie's</a> which began in 1939 and continued for some years. During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> it was requisitioned for use by British and American troops. Hearst did not return after the war but continued to lend the castle to friends; <a href="Bob%20Hope">Bob Hope</a>, the comedian, stayed in May 1951 during his visit for a golf tournament at <a href="Porthcawl">Porthcawl</a>.

Hearst died in August 1951. The castle remained on the market for the following decade until bought in 1960 by Antonin Besse II, son of the late <a href="Antonin%20Besse">Sir Antonin Besse</a>, and donated to the founding council of <a href="Atlantic%20College">Atlantic College</a>. Besse was a patron and honorary vice-president of the <a href="United%20World%20Colleges">United World Colleges</a>. The idea for an international school arose from a meeting between the educationalist <a href="Kurt%20Hahn">Kurt Hahn</a>, who founded <a href="Gordonstoun">Gordonstoun</a>, and Air Marshal Sir Lawrence Darvall, the commandant of the <a href="NATO%20Defense%20College">NATO Defense College</a>. They conceived of a college for 16–19-year-old students drawn from a wide range of nationalities, with the aim of fostering international understanding. With Rear-Admiral <a href="Desmond%20Hoare%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Desmond Hoare</a>, the first headmaster, they persuaded Besse that the castle would make a suitable location for the first United World College, which opened in 1962 with fifty-six students.

The first <a href="rigid-hulled%20inflatable%20boat">rigid-hulled inflatable boat</a> was patented by Hoare at St Donat's in the 1960s. In an act of generosity, Hoare sold the patent for the boat to the <a href="Royal%20National%20Lifeboat%20Institution">Royal National Lifeboat Institution</a> in 1973 for a notional £1; the RNLI's cheque was not cashed and remains at the castle. From 1963 until 2013 the castle hosted an RNLI lifeboat station which was credited with saving ninety-eight lives along the South Wales coast during its period of operation. The college's early years were financially precarious, but major fund-raising efforts led by <a href="George%20Schuster%20%28public%20servant%29">Sir George Schuster</a> strengthened the financial position in the mid-1960s.

The fiftieth anniversary of the college in 2012 was celebrated with a visit to the site by <a href="Queen%20Noor%20of%20Jordan">Queen Noor of Jordan</a>, President of the United World Colleges Foundation. As at 2017, the college was home to 350 students from more than 90 countries. The <a href="Hearst%20Corporation">Hearst Corporation</a> maintains a connection with St Donat's through a sponsorship programme for students at the college. With a history of occupation from its construction in the late 13th century, St Donat's has been described as the oldest continuously inhabited castle in Wales.

Detailed drawings and plans prepared by the engineer and antiquary <a href="George%20Thomas%20Clark">George Thomas Clark</a> in 1871, and subsequently by George Lambert in 1901, assisted the <a href="Royal%20Commission%20on%20the%20Ancient%20and%20Historical%20Monuments%20of%20Wales">Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales (RCAHMW)</a> in their survey of the castle published in 2000. In this survey, RCAHMW described the development of the castle in six phases: Period 1, the late-12th century; Period 2, the early-14th century; Period 3, the late-15th century; Period 4, the early-16th century; Period 5, the late-16th or early-17th centuries and finally the restorations of Carne, Williams and Hearst. The survey identified "substantial" remnants of the original <a href="Normans">Norman</a> <a href="enceinte">enceinte</a>, including the keep, which had been enveloped by later developments and had previously been unrecognised and unrecorded.

The entrance lies to the north-west. The grouping is surrounded by outer and inner <a href="Curtain%20wall%20%28fortification%29">curtain walls</a>. The outer curtain wall is pierced by a <a href="gatehouse">gatehouse</a> which leads through to an outer court. This is blocked, to the left, by Hearst's Bradenstoke Hall. A further gate, adjacent to the Mansell Tower, leads onto the inner court with the great hall to the south-west, the Bradenstoke Hall behind that, the banqueting hall to the west and the North Range to the right of the inner gatehouse.

The castle site offers natural defences, in the form of steep slopes to two sides and the coast to a third. The unprotected side to the east is encircled by a deep dry moat. The castle is built of local <a href="Lias%20Group">lias</a> limestone rubble with <a href="Sutton%20stone">Sutton stone</a> and <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> dressings. The outer gatehouse is approached through modern battlements. The gatehouse has a <a href="portcullis">portcullis</a> room above, with an original fireplace of and a wooden portcullis with wooden doors behind. The first (outer) court beyond is the earliest part of the castle, constructed by the de Haweys in the late-12th century to replace a <a href="Normans">Norman</a> timber fortification. The most recent RCAHMW survey, published in 2000, identified "significant vestiges" of the earliest stone castle which had been missed by earlier surveys. This discovery enabled a definitive dating for the first stone-built castle to "before 1200". The architectural historian <a href="John%20Newman%20%28architectural%20historian%29">John Newman</a> draws comparisons with <a href="Newcastle%20Castle%2C%20Bridgend">Newcastle</a> at <a href="Bridgend">Bridgend</a> and <a href="Coity%20Castle">Coity Castle</a>. To the sides of this gateway are a domestic range and the <a href="Brewery">Brewhouse</a>, the last major additions made by the Stradlings. The inner wall mostly survives and has a small original tower to the north, and a square gatehouse on the east beside the rectangular Mansell Tower, an enlargement of the original keep. In an article in "<a href="The%20Archaeological%20Journal">The Archaeological Journal</a>", C. P. Spurgeon notes the design similarities between the tower's door <a href="jambs">jambs</a> and those in the <a href="chancel">chancel</a> of <a href="St%20Donat%27s%20Church%2C%20St%20Donats">St Donat's church</a>, indicating an earlier construction date than that of the work undertaken by Peter de Stradling.

Through this gateway, a c. wide inner court is positioned within a polygonal inner curtain wall. The curtain walls date from c. 1300, and were built by the founder of the <a href="Stradling%20Baronets">Stradling</a> family, or perhaps by his widow's second husband. The north-west range dates from the early-16th century; the north-east range is of the late-15th century as is the great hall on the south side of the court. The double-height bay windows date from Bodley and Garner's remodelling for Morgan Williams. Alan Hall describes the inner court as having a "peaceful and domestic" appearance having been constructed in the more settled <a href="Tudor%20era">Tudor</a> period under the later Stradlings.

The exterior walls of the inner ward are decorated with a set of <a href="terracotta">terracotta</a> medallions or <a href="Bust%20%28sculpture%29">busts</a>. The writer <a href="Simon%20Jenkins">Simon Jenkins</a> suggests it is unclear whether they are original to the castle or imported from elsewhere, although the architectural historian <a href="John%20Newman%20%28architectural%20historian%29">John Newman</a> records that they were in situ by 1804. They appear to be modelled on the busts of the emperors by <a href="Giovanni%20da%20Maiano">Giovanni da Maiano</a> at <a href="Hampton%20Court">Hampton Court</a>. There are differing views as to the provenance of the medallions. <a href="Cadw">Cadw</a> is certain that two, those said to depict <a href="Marcus%20Aurelius">Marcus Aurelius</a> and <a href="Cleopatra">Cleopatra</a>, are by da Maiano and were originally part of the Hampton Court set. It also suggests they could have been installed as early as the 16th century. Alan Hall agrees, noting the close connection between <a href="Cardinal%20Wolsey">Cardinal Wolsey</a>, to whom <a href="Pope%20Leo%20X">Pope Leo X</a> had presented them, and <a href="Thomas%20Arundell%20of%20Wardour%20Castle">Sir Thomas Arundell</a>, father-in-law of the fourth Sir Edward Stradling. Newman is less definitive, although he notes their varying quality and suggests that further investigation should be undertaken.

Beside the hall, between the inner and outer curtain walls, is the Bradenstoke Hall, consisting of the inner curtain wall on the north side and the realigned outer curtain wall on the south, with a modern wall on the east end built at that point to fit in an early-14th-century roof, brought from <a href="Bradenstoke%20Priory">Bradenstoke Priory</a> in Wiltshire. The western range has largely been replaced by a larger, three-storey building which necessitated, when erected, the demolition of the western part of the outer curtain wall. All of this renewal was undertaken by Hearst to achieve larger spaces for entertaining. The historian Adrian Pettifer records St Donat's as the last inhabited castle in Wales to undergo major alteration, describing Hearst's efforts as "aggrandise(ment) with plunder".

The historian Anthony Emery, in the second of his three-volume history, "Greater Medieval Houses of England and Wales, 1300–1500", describes the interiors created by Hearst and Allom at St Donat's as "spectacular...surpassing all other work there in size and richness". Their joint creation, the Bradenstoke Hall, contains two large fireplaces of French origin as well as the eponymous, imported roof. The banqueting hall, on the ground floor of the west range, is another example of Hearst's indiscriminate use of architectural salvage. The roof is 15th-century, probably Flemish and was acquired from <a href="St%20Botolph%27s%20Church%2C%20Boston">St Botolph's Church, Boston</a>, <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>. It has coloured ceiling <a href="Boss%20%28architecture%29">bosses</a> depicting a wide array of subjects, including flowers, <a href="griffins">griffins</a>, the <a href="Living%20creatures%20%28Bible%29%23Revelation%27s%20four%20living%20beings">beasts</a> of the <a href="Four%20Evangelists">Apostles</a> and a head of Christ. The fireplace, cut to fit and with <a href="jambs">jambs</a> from a different piece, is from a château in <a href="Beauvais">Beauvais</a>. The entrance screen is from a <a href="Devon">Devon</a> church. Hearst's breakfast room, off the banqueting hall, reuses another piece of the St Botolph's ceiling, as well as a fireplace from the prior's lodgings at Bradenstoke. The library above contains a major example of <a href="linenfold">linenfold</a> panelling, the <a href="Ellenhall">Ellenhall</a> <a href="Wainscot">Wainscot</a>. Originally from a <a href="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a> manor house, the panelling was sold to a dealer by the <a href="Earl%20of%20Lichfield">Earl of Lichfield</a> in 1918 and subsequently acquired by Hearst. The Lady Anne Tower on the south-western corner is a Hearst/Allom reconstruction of the original 16th-century tower. The north range interior was remodelled in the late 1920s and contains Hearst's and Davies's bedroom suites, with an interconnecting door concealed in the panelling of Hearst's room. The panelling of Hearst's bedroom is original, but not to its current location. Allom salvaged it from the Stradling's Red Parlour, which Hearst demolished. Alan Hall notes the similarity of the panelling to that in the <a href="Common%20Room%20%28university%29">Senior Common Room</a> at <a href="Jesus%20College%2C%20Oxford">Jesus College, Oxford</a>, a foundation attended and supported by members of the Welsh gentry, including the Stradlings.

Above the banqueting hall, Hearst created an armoury filled with a notable collection of arms and armour, mainly sourced by the dealer, Raymond Bartel, whom Hearst enticed from the New York <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>. The collection, sold after Hearst's death, was at the time "one of the finest in the world", mainly bought at German auctions in the 1920s and 1930s and including a set of <a href="plate%20armour">plate armour</a> from <a href="Milan">Milan</a> considered the earliest near-complete set in existence.

The castle was designated a <a href="listed%20building">Grade I listed building</a>, the highest possible grade reserved for buildings of exceptional interest, in 1952. Cadw's listing report describes St Donat's as "an exceptionally fine medieval castle (with) many important interiors".

St Donat's Arts Centre is housed in a <a href="tithe%20barn">tithe barn</a> of medieval origin but predominantly 16th-century in construction. The barn has been converted to a professionally equipped theatre which runs a programme of cinema, exhibitions and festivals. The Glass House is a modern addition and has been described as "aggressively detailed" but offering spectacular views. John Newman considered that the other developments undertaken by the college, although to designs of "uncompromising modernity", neither "detract from the historic castle (nor) impinge on its setting".

The original gardens of the Stradlings were famous, begun in the <a href="Tudor%20era">Tudor</a> period by Sir Thomas Stradling. They were extended by his son, Sir Edward Stradling, after a long sojourn in Rome. The Tudor Stradlings also maintained two <a href="Deer%20park%20%28England%29">deer parks</a> on the wider estate, one for <a href="Red%20deer">red</a> and one for <a href="fallow%20deer">fallow deer</a>. The Welsh poet <a href="Thomas%20Leyson">Thomas Leyson</a>, a friend of Sir Edward, composed a tribute in Latin, suggesting that the beauty of the gardens was sufficient to encourage visits from the sea-god <a href="Neptune">Neptune</a> and the water-nymph <a href="Thetis">Thetis</a>. The gardens descend in a series of terraces to the sea and give distant views across the <a href="Bristol%20Channel">Bristol Channel</a> towards <a href="Devon">Devon</a> and <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>.

Later development in the early-20th century by Morgan Williams saw the establishment of a Tudor-style garden with carved <a href="heraldry">heraldic</a> beasts on pedestals. This was followed by additions by Hearst, including a number of garden structures, such as an <a href="Italianate%20architecture">Italianate</a> summerhouse overlooking the Rose Garden in which he installed a telephone exchange with connections to New York and California. Hearst built a long outdoor swimming pool on the lowest terrace, on the site of the castle's medieval <a href="tilt-yard">tilt-yard</a>. The pool was designed by Allom, assisted by <a href="Julia%20Morgan">Julia Morgan</a>, Hearst's main architect for San Simeon. Beyond the pool site are the Cavalry Barracks. Newman dates these as 17th-century, but both Alan Hall and Cadw suggest a slightly earlier dating, in the 16th century, as a response to the threat of <a href="Spanish%20Armada">Spanish invasion</a>. They were certainly converted to stabling, from whence the name derives, in the 17th century, and the Stradlings kept their horses at the barracks during the Civil War. By the 20th century the barracks were in a ruinous state and Hearst converted them into guest accommodation and a pool house in the 1930s. Between 1978 and 1981 Atlantic College rebuilt them in the original 17th-century style to serve as student accommodation. The college installed an indoor swimming pool and replaced the Allom/Morgan outdoor pool. Beyond the barracks, the <a href="castellation">castellated</a> sea walls and towers have their origins in the 16th century, but were completely reconstructed by Hearst in the 1920s. The watchtower on the opposite slope to the castle is also probably 16th-century, or possibly late-15th-century, and is shown in a state of completion in a view of the castle dated 1740. It decayed thereafter, was restored in the late-19th century, but is again derelict in the early 21st century. It was almost certainly intended as a seaward look-out.

The gardens were given <a href="listed%20building">Grade I listed status</a> in 1963, Cadw's listing report noting their "exceptional interest as a surviving 16th century terraced garden". Many of the surrounding structures have their own Grade II listings including the watchtower to the west of the castle, the sea walls and towers to the south of the castle, at the end of the terraces, the Cavalry Barracks, the lawn sundial, and the walls to the north and west of the castle entrance. The gardens remain a rare survival of a complete, terraced Tudor garden, once among the finest <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> gardens in Wales.

Pisco sour

A pisco sour is an alcoholic <a href="cocktail">cocktail</a> of <a href="Peru">Peruvian</a> origin that is typical of the cuisines from <a href="Chilean%20cuisine">Chile</a> and <a href="Peruvian%20cuisine">Peru</a>. The drink's name comes from "<a href="pisco">pisco</a>", which is its base liquor, and the cocktail term "<a href="Sour%20%28cocktail%29">sour</a>", in reference to sour citrus juice and sweetener components. The <a href="Peru">Peru</a>vian pisco sour uses Peruvian "pisco" as the base liquor and adds freshly squeezed lime juice, simple <a href="syrup">syrup</a>, ice, <a href="egg%20white">egg white</a>, and <a href="Angostura%20bitters">Angostura bitters</a>. The Chilean version is similar, but uses Chilean "pisco" and <a href="Pica%2C%20Chile">pica</a> lime, and excludes the bitters and egg white. Other variants of the cocktail include those created with fruits like <a href="pineapple">pineapple</a> or plants such as <a href="coca">coca</a> leaves.

Although the preparation of pisco-based mixed beverages possibly dates back to the 1700s, historians and drink experts agree that the cocktail as it is known today was invented in the early 1920s in <a href="Lima">Lima</a>, the capital of Peru, by the American <a href="bartender">bartender</a> <a href="Victor%20Vaughen%20Morris">Victor Vaughen Morris</a>. Morris left the United States in 1903 to work in <a href="Cerro%20de%20Pasco">Cerro de Pasco</a>, a city in central Peru. In 1916, he opened Morris' Bar in Lima, and his saloon quickly became a popular spot for the Peruvian upper class and English-speaking foreigners. The pisco sour underwent several changes until Mario Bruiget, a Peruvian bartender working at Morris' Bar, created the modern Peruvian recipe of the cocktail in the latter part of the 1920s by adding Angostura bitters and egg whites to the mix.

In <a href="Chile">Chile</a>, folklorist <a href="Oreste%20Plath">Oreste Plath</a> attributed the invention of the drink to <a href="Elliot%20Stubb">Elliot Stubb</a>, an English <a href="Steward%27s%20assistant">steward</a> of a ship named "Sunshine", who allegedly mixed Key lime juice, syrup, and ice cubes to create the cocktail in a bar, in 1872, in the port city of <a href="Iquique">Iquique</a>, which at that time was part of <a href="Peru">Peru</a>. Regardless, the original source cited by Plath attributed to Stubb the invention of the <a href="whiskey%20sour">whiskey sour</a>—not the pisco sour. The oldest known mentions of the pisco sour are from a 1921 magazine attributing Morris as the inventor and a 1924 advertisement for Morris' Bar published in a newspaper from the port of <a href="Valpara%C3%ADso">Valparaíso</a>, Chile.

Cocktail connoisseurs consider the pisco sour a <a href="South%20American%20cuisine">South American</a> classic. Chile and Peru both claim the pisco sour as their <a href="List%20of%20national%20liquors">national drink</a>, and each asserts ownership of the cocktail's base liquor—pisco; consequently, the pisco sour has become a significant and oft-debated topic of <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>n popular culture. The two kinds of pisco and the two variations in the style of preparing the pisco sour are distinct in both production and taste. Peru celebrates a yearly <a href="public%20holiday">public holiday</a> in honor of the cocktail during the first Saturday of February.

The term "sour" refers to mixed drinks containing a base <a href="Distilled%20beverage">liquor</a> (bourbon or some other whiskey), lemon or lime juice, and a sweetener. "Pisco" refers to the base liquor used in the cocktail. The word as applied to the alcoholic beverage comes from the Peruvian port of <a href="Pisco%2C%20Peru">Pisco</a>. In the book "Latin America and the Caribbean", historian Olwyn Blouet and political geographer Brian Blouet describe the development of vineyards in early <a href="Viceroyalty%20of%20Peru">Colonial Peru</a> and how in the second half of the sixteenth century a market for the liquor formed owing to the demand from growing mining settlements in the <a href="Andes">Andes</a>. Subsequent demand for a stronger drink caused Pisco and the nearby city of <a href="Ica%2C%20Peru">Ica</a> to establish distilleries "to make wine into brandy", and the product received the name of the port from where it was distilled and exported.

The first <a href="Vitis">grapevines</a> were brought to Peru shortly after its <a href="Spanish%20conquest%20of%20the%20Inca%20Empire">conquest by Spain</a> in the 16th century. Spanish <a href="chronicler">chronicler</a>s from the time note the first winemaking in South America took place in the "<a href="hacienda">hacienda</a>" Marcahuasi of <a href="Cusco">Cuzco</a>. The largest and most prominent vineyards of the 16th and 17th century Americas were established in the Ica valley of south-central Peru. In the 1540s, Bartolomé de Terrazas and Francisco de Carabantes planted vineyards in Peru. Carabantes also established vineyards in Ica, from where Spaniards from <a href="Andalusia">Andalucia</a> and <a href="Extremadura">Extremadura</a> introduced grapevines into Chile.

Already in the 16th century, Spanish settlers in Chile and Peru began producing <a href="aguardiente">aguardiente</a> <a href="Distilled%20beverage">distilled</a> from fermented grapes. Since at least 1764, Peruvian aguardiente was called "pisco" after its port of shipping; the usage of the name "pisco" for aguardiente then spread to Chile. The right to produce and market pisco, still made in Peru and Chile, is the subject of ongoing disputes between the two countries.

According to historian <a href="Luciano%20Revoredo">Luciano Revoredo</a>, the preparation of pisco with lemon dates as far back as the 18th century. He bases his claim on a source found in the "<a href="Mercurio%20Peruano">Mercurio Peruano</a>" which details the prohibition of aguardiente in Lima's "<a href="Plaza%20de%20toros%20de%20Acho">Plaza de toros de Acho</a>", the oldest bullring in the Americas. At this time, the drink was named "Punche" (<a href="Punch%20%28drink%29">Punch</a>), and was sold by slaves. Revoredo further argues this drink served as the predecessor of the Californian <a href="Pisco%20punch">Pisco punch</a>, invented by Duncan Nicol in the Bank Exchange Bar of <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, California. A recipe for a pisco-based punch, including egg whites, was found by researcher Nico Vera in the 1903 Peruvian cookbook "Manual de Cocina a la Criolla"; consequently, culinary expert Duggan McDonnell considers that "[i]t is entirely possible that the 'Cocktail' that came to be the pisco sour [...] had been prepared for a reasonable time in Lima before being included in a cookbook."

The pisco sour originated in Lima, Peru. It was created by bartender Victor Vaughen Morris, an American who had moved to Peru in 1904 to work in a railway company in <a href="Cerro%20de%20Pasco">Cerro de Pasco</a>. Morris relocated to Lima in 1915 and, a year later, opened a <a href="Bar%20%28establishment%29">saloon</a>—Morris' Bar—which became popular with both the Peruvian upper class and English-speaking foreigners. Chilean historian <a href="Gonzalo%20Vial%20Correa">Gonzalo Vial Correa</a> also attributes the pisco sour's invention to "Gringo" Morris from the Peruvian Morris Bar, but with the minor difference of naming him William Morris. Morris often experimented with new drinks, and developed the pisco sour as a variety of the whiskey Sour.

Some discrepancy exists on the exact date when Morris created the popular cocktail. Mixologist <a href="Dale%20DeGroff">Dale DeGroff</a> asserts the drink was invented in 1915, but other sources argue this happened in the 1920s. The Chilean web newspaper "<a href="El%20Mercurio%20Online">El Mercurio Online</a>" specifically contends historians attribute the year of the drink's invention as 1922, adding that "one night Morris surprised his friends with a new drink he called "pisco sour", a formula which mixes the Peruvian "pisco" with the American "<a href="Sour%20%28cocktail%29">sour</a>"" (in Spanish: ""Una noche Morris sorprendió a sus amigos con una nueva bebida a la que llamó pisco sour, una fórmula que funde lo peruano del pisco con el 'sour' estadounidense."").

The pisco sour's initial recipe was that of a simple cocktail. According to Peruvian researcher Guillermo Toro-Lira, "it is assumed that it was a crude mix of pisco with lime juice and sugar, as was the whiskey sour of those days." As the cocktail's recipe continued to evolve, the bar's registry shows that customers commented on the continuously improving taste of the drink. The modern Peruvian version of the recipe was developed by Mario Bruiget, a Peruvian from <a href="Chincha%20Alta">Chincha Alta</a> who worked under the <a href="apprenticeship">apprenticeship</a> of Morris starting on July 16, 1924. Bruiget's recipe added the Angostura bitters and egg whites to the mix. Journalist Erica Duecy writes that Bruiget's innovation added "a silky texture and frothy head" to the cocktail.

Morris used advertisements to promote his bar and invention. The oldest known mention of the pisco sour appears in the September 1920 edition of the Peruvian magazine "Hogar". Another old advertisement appears in the April 22, 1921, edition of the Peruvian magazine "Mundial". In the magazine, not only is the pisco sour described as a white-colored beverage, but its invention is attributed to "Mister Morris." Later, in 1924, with the aid of Morris' friend Nelson Rounsevell, the bar advertised its locale and invention in <a href="Valpara%C3%ADso">Valparaíso</a>, Chile. The advertisement featured in the Valparaíso newspaper "South Pacific Mail", owned by Rounsevell. By 1927, Morris' Bar had attained widespread notability for its cocktails, particularly the pisco sour. Brad Thomas Parsons writes that "the registry at the Morris Bar was filled with high praise from visitors who raved about the signature drink."

Over time, competition from nearby bars and Victor Morris' deteriorating health led to the decline and fall of his enterprise. During this time, due to his worsening constitution, Morris delegated most of the bartending to his employees. Adding to the problem, nearby competitors, such as the <a href="Hotel%20Bol%C3%ADvar">Hotel Bolívar</a> and the Hotel Lima Country Club, housed bars which took clientele away from Morris' Bar. Moreover, Toro-Lira discovered that Morris accused four of his former bartenders of intellectual property theft after they left to work in one of these competing establishments. In 1929, Morris declared voluntary <a href="bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a> and closed his saloon. A few months later, on June 11, Victor Vaughen Morris died of <a href="cirrhosis">cirrhosis</a>.

Historian <a href="Luis%20Alberto%20S%C3%A1nchez">Luis Alberto Sánchez</a> writes that, after Morris closed his bar, some of his bartenders left to work in other locales. Bruiget began working as a bartender for the nearby <a href="Grand%20Hotel%20Maury">Grand Hotel Maury</a>, where he continued to serve his pisco sour recipe. His success with the drink led local Limean oral tradition to associate the Hotel Maury as the original home of the pisco sour. As other former apprentices of Morris found other work, they also spread the pisco sour recipe. During the 1930s the drink made its way into <a href="California">California</a>, reaching bars as far north as the city of San Francisco. By at least the late 1960s the cocktail also found its way to New York.

Beatriz Jiménez, a journalist from the Spanish newspaper "<a href="El%20Mundo%20%28Spain%29">El Mundo</a>", indicates that back in Peru, the luxury hotels of Lima adopted the pisco sour as their own in the 1940s. During the 1940s and 1950s an oil bonanza attracted foreign attention to Peru. Among the visitors to Lima were renowned Hollywood actors who were fascinated by the pisco sour. Jiménez recollected oral traditions claiming an inebriated <a href="Ava%20Gardner">Ava Gardner</a> had to be carried away by <a href="John%20Wayne">John Wayne</a> after drinking too many pisco sours. <a href="Ernest%20Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a> and <a href="Orson%20Welles">Orson Welles</a> are said to have been big fans of what they described as "that Peruvian drink."

In 1984, Bolivian journalist Ted Córdova Claure writes that the Hotel Bolívar stood as a monument to the decadence of Peruvian oligarchy (in Spanish: ""Este hotel es un monumento a la decadencia de la oligarquía peruana.""). He noted the locale as being the traditional home of the pisco sour and recommended it as one of the best hotels in Lima. Nowadays, the Hotel Bolivar continues to offer the cocktail in its "El Bolivarcito" bar, while the Country Club Lima Hotel offers the drink in its "English Bar" saloon.

Victor Vaughen Morris is considered by most historians to be the inventor of the cocktail. Despite this, there exists an ongoing dispute between Chile and Peru over the origin of the pisco sour. In Chile, a local <a href="Urban%20legend">story</a> developed in the 1980s attributing the invention of the pisco sour to Elliot Stubb, an English steward from a <a href="sailing%20ship">sailing ship</a> named "Sunshine." Chilean folklorist and historian <a href="Oreste%20Plath">Oreste Plath</a> contributed to the legend's propagation by writing that, according to the Peruvian newspaper "El Comercio de Iquique", in 1872, after obtaining leave to disembark, Stubb opened a bar in the then-Peruvian port of <a href="Iquique">Iquique</a> and invented the pisco sour while experimenting with drinks.

Nevertheless, researcher Toro-Lira argues that the story was refuted after it was discovered "El Comercio de Iquique" was actually referring to the invention of the <a href="whiskey%20sour">whiskey sour</a>. This claim is further certified by the <a href="National%20University%20of%20Cuyo">University of Cuyo</a>, <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, which in 1962 published the story of Elliot Stubb and his alleged invention of the whiskey sour in Iquique. An excerpt from the newspaper's story has Elliot Stubb stating, "From now on ... this shall be my drink of battle, my favorite drink, and it shall be named Whisky Sour" (in Spanish: ""En adelante dijo Elliot — éste será mi trago de batalla, — mi trago favorito —, y se llamará Whisky Sour."").

The pisco sour has three different methods of preparation. The Peruvian pisco sour cocktail is made by mixing Peruvian <a href="pisco">pisco</a> with <a href="Key%20lime">Key lime</a> juice, <a href="Syrup">simple syrup</a>, <a href="egg%20white">egg white</a>, <a href="Angostura%20bitters">Angostura bitters</a> (for <a href="Cocktail%20garnish">garnish</a>), and ice cubes. The Chilean pisco sour cocktail is made by mixing Chilean Pisco with <a href="Pica%2C%20Chile">Pica</a> lime juice, <a href="powdered%20sugar">powdered sugar</a>, and ice cubes. Daniel Joelson, a food writer and critic, contends that the major difference between both pisco sour versions "is that Peruvians generally include egg whites, while Chileans do not." The version from the <a href="International%20Bartenders%20Association">International Bartenders Association</a>, which lists the pisco sour among its "<a href="List%20of%20IBA%20official%20cocktails">New Era Drinks</a>," is similar to the Peruvian version, but with the difference that it uses <a href="lemon">lemon juice</a>, instead of lime juice, and does not distinguish between the two different types of pisco.

Considerable variations exist in the pisco used in the cocktails. According to food and wine expert Mark Spivak, the difference is in the way both beverages are produced; whereas "Chilean pisco is mass-produced", the Peruvian version "is made in small batches." Cocktail historian Andrew Bohrer focuses his comparison on taste, claiming that "[i]n Peru, pisco is made in a pot still, distilled to proof, and un-aged; it is very similar to <a href="grappa">grappa</a>. In Chile, pisco is made in a column still and aged in wood; it is similar to a very light <a href="cognac">cognac</a>." Chilean <a href="Oenology">oenologist</a> Patricio Tapia adds that while Chilean pisco producers usually mix vine stocks, Peruvian producers have specific pisco types that use the <a href="aroma%20of%20wine">aromatic</a> qualities of vines such as <a href="Muscat%20Blanc%20%C3%A0%20Petits%20Grains">Yellow Muscat</a> and <a href="Italia%20%28grape%29">Italia</a>. Tapia concludes this is why Peruvian pisco bottles denote their <a href="vintage">vintage</a> year and the Chilean versions do not.

Variations of the pisco sour exist in Peru, <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>, and Chile. There are adaptations of the cocktail in Peru using fruits such as "<a href="Passiflora%20edulis">maracuya</a>", "<a href="Physalis%20peruviana">aguaymanto</a>", and apples, or traditional ingredients such as the <a href="coca">coca</a> leaf. In Chile, variants include the Ají Sour (with a spicy green chili), Mango Sour (with <a href="mango">mango</a> juice), and Sour de Campo (with ginger and honey). In Bolivia, the <a href="Yunque%C3%B1o">Yunqueño</a> variant (from its <a href="Bolivian%20Yungas">Yungas region</a>) replaces the lime with orange juice.

Cocktails similar to the pisco sour include the Chilean <a href="Piscola">Piscola</a> and the Peruvian <a href="Algarrobina%20Cocktail">Algarrobina Cocktail</a>. Piscola is made by mixing pisco with <a href="cola">cola</a>. The Algarrobina Cocktail is made from pisco, <a href="condensed%20milk">condensed milk</a>, and sap from the Peruvian "<a href="Prosopis%20humilis">algarroba</a>" tree. Another similar cocktail, from the United States, is the Californian <a href="pisco%20punch">pisco punch</a>, originally made with Peruvian pisco, pineapples, and lemon.

Duggan McDonnell describes the pisco sour as "Latin America's most elegant cocktail, frothy, balanced, bright yet rich," adding that "Barkeeps throughout Northern California will attest that they have shaken many a Pisco sour. It is the egg white cocktail of choice and an absolutely beloved one by most." Australian journalist Kate Schneider writes that the pisco sour "has become so famous that there is an International Pisco Sour Day celebration on the first Saturday in February every year, as well as a <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> page with more than 600,000 likes." According to Chilean <a href="entrepreneur">entrepreneur</a> Rolando Hinrichs Oyarce, owner of a restaurant-bar in <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, "The pisco sour is highly international, just like <a href="Cebiche">Cebiche</a>, and so they are not too unknown" (Spanish: ""El pisco sour es bastante internacional, al igual que el cebiche, por lo tanto no son tan desconocidos""). In 2003, Peru created the ""Día Nacional del Pisco Sour"" (National Pisco Sour Day), an official government holiday celebrated on the first Saturday of February.

During the 2008 <a href="Asia-Pacific%20Economic%20Cooperation">APEC</a> Economic Leaders' Meeting, Peru promoted its pisco sour with widespread acceptance. The cocktail was reportedly the preferred drink of the attendees, mostly leaders, businessmen, and delegates. American <a href="celebrity%20chef">celebrity chef</a> <a href="Anthony%20Bourdain">Anthony Bourdain</a> also drew attention to the cocktail when, in an episode of his <a href="Travel%20Channel">Travel Channel</a> program "", he drank a pisco sour in Valparaíso, Chile, and said "that's good, but ... next time, I'll have a beer." The broadcaster <a href="Radio%20Programas%20del%20Per%C3%BA">Radio Programas del Perú</a> reported that Jorge López Sotomayor, the episode's Chilean producer and Bourdain's travel partner in Chile, said Bourdain found the pisco sour he drank in Valparaíso as boring and worthless (in Spanish: ""A mí me dijo que el pisco sour lo encontró aburrido y que no valía la pena.""). Lopez added that Bourdain had recently arrived from Peru, where he drank several pisco sours which he thought tasted better than the Chilean version.

In Mexico, singer-songwriter <a href="Aleks%20Syntek">Aleks Syntek</a> humorously posted on <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> that the pisco sour is Chilean and, after receiving critical responses to his statement, apologized and mentioned he was only joking. Mexican television host and comedian <a href="Adal%20Ramones">Adal Ramones</a> also joked about pisco sour, in reference to the <a href="2009%20Chile%E2%80%93Peru%20espionage%20scandal">2009 Chile–Peru espionage scandal</a>, on November 17, 2009. Ramones, a fan of Peruvian Pisco, when asked about the espionage, asked what Chileans were spying on in Peru, suggesting it might be how to make a pisco sour (in Spanish: ""¿Qué quieren espiar los chilenos? ¿Cómo hacer pisco sour?"").

Solomon P. Sharp

Solomon Porcius Sharp (August 22, 1787 – November 7, 1825) was an American attorney and politician, serving as <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20Kentucky">attorney general of Kentucky</a> and a member of the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> and the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">Kentucky General Assembly</a>. His murder by <a href="Jereboam%20O.%20Beauchamp">Jereboam O. Beauchamp</a> in 1825 is referred to as the <a href="Beauchamp%E2%80%93Sharp%20Tragedy">Beauchamp–Sharp Tragedy</a> or "The Kentucky Tragedy."

Sharp began his political career representing <a href="Warren%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Warren County</a>, in the <a href="Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">Kentucky House of Representatives</a>. He briefly served in the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>, then returned to Kentucky and was elected to the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a> in 1813. He was re-elected to a second term, though his support of a controversial bill regarding legislator salaries cost him his seat in 1816. Allied with Kentucky's Debt Relief Party, he returned to the Kentucky House in 1817; in 1821, he accepted Governor <a href="John%20Adair">John Adair</a>'s appointment to the post of Attorney General of Kentucky. Adair's successor, <a href="Joseph%20Desha">Joseph Desha</a>, re-appointed him to this position. In 1825, Sharp resigned as attorney general to return to the Kentucky House.

In 1820, rumors surfaced that Sharp had fathered a <a href="stillbirth">stillborn</a> <a href="illegitimacy">illegitimate child</a> with Anna Cooke, a planter's daughter. Sharp denied the charge, and the immediate political effects were minimal. When the charges were repeated during Sharp's 1825 General Assembly campaign, opponents publicized the allegation that the child was a <a href="mulatto">mulatto</a>. Whether Sharp made such a claim, or whether it was a rumor started by his political enemies, remains in doubt. Jereboam Beauchamp, who had married Cooke in 1824, avenged the honor of his wife by fatally stabbing Sharp at his home early on the morning of November 7, 1825. Sharp's murder inspired fictional works, most notably <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>'s unfinished play "<a href="Politian%20%28play%29">Politian</a>" and <a href="Robert%20Penn%20Warren">Robert Penn Warren</a>'s novel "World Enough and Time" (1950).

Solomon Sharp was born on August 22, 1787, at <a href="Abingdon%2C%20Virginia">Abingdon</a>, <a href="Washington%20County%2C%20Virginia">Washington County</a>, <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>. He was the fifth child and third son of Captain Thomas and Jean (Maxwell) Sharp, a Scottish woman. Through the male line he was a great-great-grandson of <a href="John%20Sharp%2C%20Archbishop%20of%20York">John Sharp, Archbishop of York</a>. His father Thomas Sharp was a veteran of the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">Revolutionary War</a>, participating in the <a href="Battle%20of%20King%27s%20Mountain">Battle of King's Mountain</a>. The family briefly moved to the area near <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a>, and to North Carolina, before settling permanently about 1795 at <a href="Russellville%2C%20Kentucky">Russellville</a>, <a href="Logan%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Logan County</a>, where they lived in a log cabin near the <a href="Muddy%20River%20%28Kentucky%29">Muddy River</a>.

Sharp "[intermittently attended] one of Logan County's academies" during his childhood years; the schools of Logan County were primitive then. He read the law and was admitted to the <a href="bar%20%28law%29">bar</a> in 1806. He opened a practice in Russellville, but soon relocated to the busier <a href="Warren%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Warren County</a> seat of <a href="Bowling%20Green%2C%20Kentucky">Bowling Green</a>, which had 154 residents in 1810. He engaged in land <a href="speculation">speculation</a>, sometimes in partnership with his brother, Dr. Leander Sharp, and by 1824, had acquired 11,000 acres, mostly north of the <a href="Barren%20River">Barren River</a> in <a href="Warren%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Warren County</a>.

After getting established, on December 17, 1818, Sharp at the age of 31 married Eliza T. Scott, the daughter of a physician who had served as an officer in the War of 1812. She was from Frankfort and above him in social standing. They had three children together. He moved the family to the state capital of <a href="Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky">Frankfort</a> in 1820 for his political career.

In 1809, Sharp was elected to represent <a href="Warren%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Warren County</a> in the <a href="Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">Kentucky House of Representatives</a>. During his tenure, he supported the legislature's election of <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a> to the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a>, the creation of a state lottery, and the creation of an academy in <a href="Barren%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Barren County</a>. He served on a number of committees, and for a time, served as interim <a href="speaker%20of%20the%20house">speaker of the house</a> during the General Assembly's second session. He was re-elected in 1810 and 1811. By 1810, the county had nearly 12,000 residents. During the 1811 session, Sharp worked with <a href="Benjamin%20Hardin">Ben Hardin</a> to secure passage of a bill to ensure that state officers and attorneys at law would not be involved in <a href="duel">duel</a>ing. He also opposed a measure allowing harsher treatment of slaves.

Sharp's political service was interrupted by the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>. On September 18, 1812, he enlisted as a <a href="private%20%28rank%29">private</a> in the Kentucky <a href="militia">militia</a>, serving under <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> Young Ewing. Twelve days later, in a rapid rise even for the militia, he was promoted to <a href="major">major</a> and made a part of Ewing's staff. Ewing's unit was put under the command of <a href="General%20officer">general</a> <a href="Samuel%20Hopkins%20%28congressman%29">Samuel Hopkins</a> during his ineffective expedition against the <a href="Shawnee">Shawnee</a>. In total, the expedition lasted forty-two days and never engaged the enemy. Sharp recognized the value of a record of military service in Kentucky politics, however; he was eventually was promoted to the rank of colonel.

In 1812, Sharp was elected to the <a href="13th%20United%20States%20Congress">Thirteenth Congress</a> as a member of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a> and took his seat at the age of 25, the minimum for election. Aligning with the <a href="War%20Hawks">War Hawks</a>, he defended <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a>'s decision to lead the country into the war, and supported a proposal to offer of land to any <a href="Great%20Britain">British</a> <a href="Desertion">deserters</a>. Sharp also "[passionately denounced] Federalist obstruction of the war effort". In a speech on April 8, 1813, he opposed <a href="indemnity">indemnity</a> for those defrauded in the <a href="Yazoo%20land%20scandal">Yazoo land scandal</a> in Mississippi. He allied with <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>'s <a href="John%20C.%20Calhoun">John C. Calhoun</a> in supporting the <a href="Second%20Bank%20of%20the%20United%20States">Second Bank of the United States</a>.

Sharp was re-elected to the <a href="14th%20United%20States%20Congress">Fourteenth Congress</a>, during which he served as chairman of the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Private%20Land%20Claims">Committee on Private Land Claims</a>. He supported the controversial Compensation Act of 1816 sponsored by fellow Kentuckian <a href="Richard%20Mentor%20Johnson">Richard Mentor Johnson</a>. The measure, which paid Congressmen a flat salary instead of paying them on a daily basis for the days when they were in session, was unpopular with the voters of his district. When the next congressional session opened in December 1816, Sharp reversed his position and voted to repeal the law, but the damage was already done; he lost his seat in the House in the next election.

In 1817, Sharp was again elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives. During his term, he supported measures for <a href="internal%20improvements">internal improvements</a>, but opposed the creation of a state health board and a proposal to open the state's vacant lands to the widows and orphans of soldiers killed in the War of 1812. Most notably, he supported the creation of 46 new banks in the state, and proposed a tax on the branches of the Bank of the United States in <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington</a> and <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville</a>.

In May or June 1820, Anna Cooke, an unmarried planter's daughter in her early 30s, claimed that Sharp was the father of her illegitimate child; Sharp denied her claim. The stillborn child was rumored to have dark skin, and some speculated that it was a <a href="mulatto">mulatto</a>, with a black father. After her father's death and the sale of their plantation in <a href="Fairfax%20County%2C%20Virginia">Fairfax County, Virginia</a>, Cooke had moved with her mother and siblings to Warren County between 1805 and 1810, when she may have met Sharp. In addition to losing the child, Cooke suffered the deaths of three of her five brothers between 1818 and 1821.

The scandal soon abated for Sharp, as Anna had a reputation as "a freethinker, reader of romantic fiction, and a libertine". Although Sharp's political opponents would continue to call attention to his putative child in future campaigns, his reputation remained largely untarnished.

In 1821, Sharp began a campaign for a seat in the <a href="Kentucky%20Senate">Kentucky Senate</a>. His opponent, attorney <a href="John%20U.%20Waring">John U. Waring</a>, was a notably violent and contentious man, frequently in court because of altercations. (In 1835, he shot and killed the attorney Samuel Q. Richardson).

Waring sent two threatening letters to Sharp, and on June 18, 1821, published a handbill attacking Sharp's character. Five days later, Sharp ceased campaigning for the senatorial seat. He accepted an appointment by Governor <a href="John%20Adair">John Adair</a> to the position of <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20Kentucky">attorney general of Kentucky</a>. Sharp's nomination was unanimously confirmed by the legislature on October 30, 1821.

Sharp took office at a critical time Kentucky's history. Still reeling from the financial <a href="Panic%20of%201819">Panic of 1819</a>, state politicians had split into two camps: those who supported legislation favorable to debtors (the Debt Relief Party) and those who favored the protection of creditors (typically called Anti-Reliefers.) Sharp had identified with the Relief Party, as had Governor Adair.

In the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201824">1824 presidential election</a>, Sharp alienated some of his constituency by supporting his former House colleague John C. Calhoun instead of Kentucky's favorite son, <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a>. When it was clear that Calhoun's bid would fail, Sharp threw his support behind <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a>. He served as secretary of a meeting of Jackson supporters in Frankfort on October 2, 1824.

After Governor Adair's term expired in 1825, he was succeeded by another Relief Party member, General <a href="Joseph%20Desha">Joseph Desha</a>. Desha and Sharp had been colleagues in Congress, and Desha re-appointed Sharp as attorney general. The Relief faction in the legislature passed several measures favorable to debtors, but the <a href="Kentucky%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Kentucky Court of Appeals</a> struck them down as unconstitutional. Unable to muster the votes to remove the hostile justices on the Court of Appeals, Relief partisans in the General Assembly passed legislation to abolish the entire court and create a new one, which Governor Desha promptly stocked with sympathetic judges. For a time, two courts claimed authority as Kentucky's court of last resort; this period was referred to as the <a href="Old%20Court-New%20Court%20controversy">Old Court-New Court controversy</a>.

Sharp's role in the Relief Party's plan to abolish the old court and replace it with a new, more favorable court is not known. As he was the administration's chief legal counsel, historians believe he was closely involved. He is known to have issued the order for Old Court clerk Achilles Sneed to turn over his records to New Court clerk <a href="Francis%20P.%20Blair">Francis P. Blair</a>. By practicing as state attorney general before the New Court to the exclusion of the Old Court, Sharp provided it a measure of legitimacy.

On May 11, 1825, Sharp was chosen to represent the Desha administration in welcoming the <a href="Gilbert%20du%20Motier%2C%20marquis%20de%20La%20Fayette">Marquis de Lafayette</a>, a hero of the American Revolution, to Kentucky. At a banquet in Lafayette's honor three days later, Sharp toasted the guest of honor: "The People: Liberty will always be safe in their holy keeping." Shortly following this event, Sharp resigned as attorney general, likely because Relief Party advocates thought he would be more useful as a member of the General Assembly.

The Anti-Relief partisans nominated former <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senator</a> <a href="John%20J.%20Crittenden">John J. Crittenden</a> for one of the two seats apportioned to <a href="Franklin%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Franklin County</a> in the state House. The Relief Party countered with Sharp and Lewis Sanders, a prominent area lawyer. During the sharply contested campaign, both John U. Waring and Patrick Henry Darby, a land speculator, said that Sharp's life was at risk if he won. Opponents revived the charges of Sharp's illegitimate child. It was also alleged that Sharp had claimed that the child was mulatto and said he had a certificate from Cooke's midwife to that effect; whether Sharp made this claim may never be known for certain. Despite the controversy, Sharp netted the most votes in the election, winning by 69 out of a total of 1600 votes cast in the county.

"It was a land of the fiddle and whisky, sweat and prayer, pride and depravity. - Robert Penn Warren, "World Enough and Time: A Romantic Novel" (1950)

In the early hours of November 7, 1825, the day the General Assembly was to open its session, a man knocked on the door of Sharp's residence. When Sharp answered the door, the visitor grabbed him with his left hand and used his right to stab him in the heart with a poisoned dagger. Sharp died at approximately two o'clock in the morning. After <a href="lying%20in%20state">lying in state</a> in the House of Representatives Hall, he was buried in <a href="Frankfort%20Cemetery">Frankfort Cemetery</a>.

Because of the bitterness of the campaign and the timing of the murder, speculation mounted that Sharp had been killed by an Anti-Relief partisan. For some time, rumors traveled that Darby was implicated in his death. Sharp's political rival, John J. Crittenden, tried to blunt such accusations by personally introducing a resolution condemning the murder and offering a $3000 reward for the capture of the assassin. The trustees of the city of Frankfort added a reward of $1000, and an additional $2000 reward was raised from private sources. In the 1825 session of the General Assembly, a measure to form Sharp County from <a href="Muhlenberg%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Muhlenberg County</a> died on the floor due to the tumultuous politics of the session.

In the investigation that followed, the evidence quickly pointed to <a href="Jereboam%20O.%20Beauchamp">Jereboam O. Beauchamp</a>, 23, who had married the much older Anna Cooke in 1824. (She was a contemporary of Sharp). On November 11, 1825, a four-man <a href="Posse%20comitatus%20%28common%20law%29">posse</a> arrested Beauchamp at his home in <a href="Franklin%2C%20Kentucky">Franklin</a>.

He was tried and convicted of Sharp's murder on May 19, 1826. His sentence – execution by hanging – was to be carried out on June 16, 1826. Beauchamp requested a <a href="stay%20of%20execution">stay of execution</a> so that he could write a justification of his actions; he continued to assert his avenging his wife's honor. The request was granted, allowing Beauchamp to complete his book, "The Confession of Jereboam O. Beauchamp: who was hanged at Frankfort, Ky., on the 7th day of July, 1826, for the murder of Col. Solomon P. Sharp". After two <a href="suicide%20attempt">suicide attempt</a>s with his wife, who died as a result of the second incident, Beauchamp was hanged for his crime on July 7, 1826. Beauchamp's "Confession" was published in 1826. Some editions included "The Letters of Ann Cook" as an appendix. Historians dispute whether Cooke was their author.

The following year, Sharp's brother, Dr. Leander Sharp, wrote "Vindication of the Character of the Late Col. Solomon P. Sharp" to defend him from the charges contained in Beauchamp's confession. In "Vindication", Dr. Sharp portrayed the killing as a political assassination: he named Patrick Darby, a partisan of the Anti-Relief faction, as co-conspirator with Beauchamp, an Anti-Relief stalwart. Darby threatened to sue Sharp if he published his "Vindication"; and Waring threatened to kill him. Heeding these threats, Sharp did not publish his work; all extant manuscripts remained in his house, where they were discovered many years later during a remodeling.

The events have inspired numerous works of fiction, drama and history:

O-Bahn Busway

The O-Bahn Busway is a <a href="guided%20bus">guided bus</a>way that is part of the <a href="bus%20rapid%20transit">bus rapid transit</a> system servicing the northeastern suburbs of <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>. The O-Bahn system was conceived by <a href="Daimler-Benz">Daimler-Benz</a> to enable buses to avoid traffic congestion by sharing <a href="tram">tram</a> tunnels in the German city of <a href="Essen">Essen</a>.

Adelaide's O-Bahn was introduced in 1986 to service the city's rapidly expanding <a href="City%20of%20Tea%20Tree%20Gully">north-eastern suburbs</a>, replacing an earlier plan for a <a href="Trams%20in%20Adelaide">tramway extension</a>. The O-Bahn provides specially built track, combining elements of both bus and rail systems. Adelaide's track is long and includes three interchanges at <a href="Klemzig%20Interchange">Klemzig</a>, <a href="Paradise%20Interchange">Paradise</a> and <a href="Tea%20Tree%20Plaza%20Interchange">Tea Tree Plaza</a>. Interchanges allow buses to enter and exit the busway and to continue on suburban routes, avoiding the need for passengers to transfer to another bus to continue their journey. Buses can travel at a maximum speed of , but are now restricted to 85 km/h (53 mph). , the busway carries approximately 31,000 people per weekday. An additional section including a 670-metre tunnel opened in 2017 at the city end to reduce the number of congested intersections buses must traverse to enter the Adelaide city centre.

The development of the O-Bahn busway led to the development of the <a href="Torrens%20Linear%20Park">Torrens Linear Park</a> from a run-down urban drain into an attractive public open space. It has also triggered urban development around the north-eastern terminus at <a href="Modbury%2C%20South%20Australia">Modbury</a>.

The O-Bahn track is made of concrete; it is elevated above ground because of the poor quality of <a href="alluvial%20soil">alluvial soil</a>s along the <a href="River%20Torrens">River Torrens</a>, which frequently move due to their high level of <a href="plasticity%20%28physics%29">plasticity</a>. Concrete <a href="Tower%23Transportation%20support">pylons</a> were cast into the ground to ensure stability, to a depth of up to four metres. On top of the pylons are <a href="concrete%20sleeper">concrete sleeper</a>s on which the track runs. 5,600 pylons were drilled in place to support 5,600 sleepers and 4,200 prefabricated L-shaped track pieces, sited at 12-metre (40-ft) intervals. The width of both tracks, sitting on the sleepers, is . The O-Bahn's concrete tracks were narrower and lighter than those of the initially proposed light rail development, and put less stress on the land. The concrete components were precast and then laid onto piers.

At the city end, the O-Bahn begins at East Terrace, as an extension eastwards from Grenfell Street into the parklands. The O-Bahn enters an 850-metre tunnel, completed in December 2017, which curves from east to north, emerging onto bus lanes in the middle of Hackney Road just north of the intersection with Botanic Road and North Terrace. The bus lanes continue north to the Torrens River and into the original entrance of the O-Bahn on Hackney Road, opposite the <a href="Adelaide%20Park%20Lands">East Parklands</a>, where it enters a 60-metre tunnel at a speed limited to , due to the tight initial corner, ensuring that the rear tyres (especially trailer tyres of <a href="articulated%20buses">articulated buses</a>) do not 'scrub' against the track. Speed is gradually increased to for most of the trip to <a href="Klemzig%20Interchange">Klemzig Interchange</a>. Once en route to <a href="Paradise%20Interchange">Paradise Interchange</a>, the speed limit was up to , but has been limited to since late 2012. On some sections was achieved in tests. The average service speed including stops is about . On entering interchanges the O-Bahn ends and the speed limit is . In the interchange area, the speed limit is . The O-Bahn is officially considered a road, due to a court ruling in the early years of the system's operation. This ruling permits the <a href="South%20Australia%20Police">South Australia Police</a> to install <a href="speed%20camera">speed camera</a>s and fine speeding drivers.

Cars entering the O-Bahn are deterred by a large number of signs at entrance points and a "<a href="sump%20buster">sump buster</a>" device that rips out a car's <a href="sump">sump</a> (oil pan) if it gets onto the track. An average of four cars per year enter the O-Bahn and must be removed by crane.

The first buses to enter service on the O-Bahn were 41 rigid and 51 <a href="articulated%20bus">articulated</a> <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20O305">Mercedes-Benz O305</a>s. These were modified for O-Bahn use by <a href="Mitsubishi%20Motors">Mitsubishi Motors</a>' <a href="Clovelly%20Park">Clovelly Park</a> plant before being bodied by <a href="Pressed%20Metal%20Corporation%20South%20Australia">Pressed Metal Corporation South Australia</a>. The cost was included in the original $98 million budget. Modified <a href="MAN%20Truck%20%26amp%3B%20Bus">MAN</a> SG280s and <a href="MAN%20SL202">SL202s</a> were later purchased.

With the Mercedes-Benz O305s approaching their 25-year age limit, tenders were called in 2007 for replacements. The new buses were <a href="Scania%20K%20UB">Scania K230UB/K280UB</a> rigid and <a href="Scania%20K%20UA">Scania K320UA</a> articulated buses bodied by <a href="Custom%20Coaches">Custom Coaches</a>. , these along with one <a href="MAN%20SL202">MAN SL202</a>, and one <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20O405NH">Mercedes-Benz O405NH</a> make up the fleet.

In the case of breakdowns, a specially designed vehicle nicknamed 'Dumbo' is used to tow buses from the O-Bahn. In the early stages of design it was intended that all buses would have towing ability; however, this was soundly rejected by the drivers' union and 'Dumbo' was purchased. If a tyre blows during a trip the guide-wheel prevents the bus from erratic movement, and a smaller aluminium inner tyre allows the bus to be driven to the nearest station at .

The guide-wheel, which protrudes just ahead of the front wheels, is the most important part of the bus when travelling on the O-Bahn. It is connected directly to the steering mechanism, and steers the bus by running along the raised edge of the track. While it is not strictly necessary for drivers to hold the <a href="steering%20wheel">steering wheel</a> when travelling on the O-Bahn because of the guide-wheel, safety procedures require the driver to be alert to their circumstances at all times. A <a href="rumble%20strip">rumble strip</a> before stations is a reminder that they need to resume control. The guide-wheel is the most delicate part of the system and is designed to snap off upon sharp impact; before the O-Bahn was in place, a number of buses were fitted with guide-wheels for their ordinary routes to test their durability. Drivers were forced to be more cautious on their normal trips after numerous guide-wheel-to-curb impacts.

Since June 2018, services are operated by <a href="Torrens%20Transit">Torrens Transit</a> under contract to <a href="Adelaide%20Metro">Adelaide Metro</a>. , the busway carries approximately 31,000 people per weekday.

<a href="Klemzig%20Interchange">Klemzig Interchange</a> is the first station, three kilometres (1.8 mi) from the city centre in the suburb of <a href="Klemzig%2C%20South%20Australia">Klemzig</a>. It was built as a connector to the city loop 'Circle Line' bus service, which followed the Adelaide outer ring route. Many bus services bypass Klemzig and the station has limited capacity. It contains a <a href="Park%20%26amp%3B%20Ride">Park & Ride</a> carpark with 450 spaces.

<a href="Paradise%20Interchange">Paradise Interchange</a> is the second station, six kilometres (3.7 mi) from the city centre, in the suburb of <a href="Paradise%2C%20South%20Australia">Paradise</a>. The terminus before the completion of Stage 2, it is now served by buses from suburban streets, and has a total of 875 car parking spaces in two areas.

<a href="Tea%20Tree%20Plaza%20Interchange">Tea Tree Plaza Interchange</a> is the terminus, from the city centre, in <a href="Modbury%2C%20South%20Australia">Modbury</a>. Adjacent to the <a href="Westfield%20Tea%20Tree%20Plaza">Westfield Tea Tree Plaza</a>, it is the largest O-Bahn station. Bus services from this interchange connect to areas as far away as <a href="Elizabeth%2C%20South%20Australia">Elizabeth</a> and service the <a href="Golden%20Grove%2C%20South%20Australia">Golden Grove</a> area. It has 700 car parking spaces, after a multiple level carpark was built during a redevelopment in 2013.

Outbound O-Bahn bus routes travel through the <a href="Adelaide%20city%20centre">Adelaide city centre</a> along <a href="Grenfell%20Street%2C%20Adelaide">Grenfell Street</a>, and enter the O-Bahn via the 670-metre tunnel (opened on 10 December 2017) through the <a href="Adelaide%20Park%20Lands">Adelaide Park Lands</a> in <a href="Rymill%20Park">Rymill Park</a>. They then exit the tunnel on Hackney Road, north of the intersection with <a href="Dequetteville%20Terrace%2C%20Adelaide">Dequetteville Terrace</a>, and then proceed northwards along the road in designated bus lanes. Along this stretch the <a href="Adelaide%20Botanic%20Garden">Adelaide Botanic Garden</a> is on the left, followed by <a href="Botanic%20Park%2C%20Adelaide">Botanic Park</a>. Hackney Road - along with the designated O-Bahn bus lanes - crosses a bridge over the <a href="River%20Torrens">River Torrens</a>, with the bus lanes veering easterly, to the northbound entrance of the guided O-Bahn busway. The busway dips below the surface road (Park Road) to join the inbound (southbound) track, both heading northeast.

The busway follows roughly the Torrens River valley, but with smoother curves. This means that it crosses the river quite often, with either a park or a few houses on a point surrounded by the river and busway. This occurs a total of eight times before the busway reaches <a href="Klemzig%20Interchange">Klemzig Interchange</a> on the north side of the river. The busway crosses the river again soon after Klemzig and passes Lochiel Park and part of the suburbs of <a href="Campbelltown%2C%20South%20Australia">Campbelltown</a> and <a href="Paradise%2C%20South%20Australia">Paradise</a> to its north between the busway and the river before reaching <a href="Paradise%20Interchange">Paradise Interchange</a>.

After Paradise Interchange, the busway passes under Darley Road, then over the Torrens for the last time. The terrain becomes steeper as the busway proceeds up along the outflow creek and past the northwestern side of the <a href="Hope%20Valley%20Reservoir">Hope Valley Reservoir</a>. It proceeds north under <a href="Grand%20Junction%20Road">Grand Junction Road</a>, then swings east and north again to enter the eastern side of the <a href="Tea%20Tree%20Plaza">Tea Tree Plaza</a> shopping centre precinct, where the guided busway ends at <a href="Tea%20Tree%20Plaza%20Interchange">Tea Tree Plaza Interchange</a>. Most buses continue on normal roads to service suburbs further afield.

All listed routes connect Adelaide City Centre to the named endpoint, but service different suburbs between the O-Bahn interchange and that endpoint.

The greater Adelaide area experienced significant growth during and after the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. Between 1944 and 1965, the area's population doubled, and the number of private motor vehicle registrations increased 43-fold. In 1955 the state government under Premier <a href="Thomas%20Playford%20IV">Sir Thomas Playford</a> established a Town Planning Committee and commissioned a coordinated plan to guide the future development of Adelaide. The resulting 300-page study, "Report on the Metropolitan Area of Adelaide 1962", laid out a 30-year development plan, including a proposed of improved roadways. Shortly before leaving office in 1965, Playford commissioned a detailed study focusing on the recommended transportation improvements.

In 1968 the government received the "<a href="Metropolitan%20Adelaide%20Transport%20Study">Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study</a>". The MATS plan envisaged a network of 10 freeways crossing the metropolitan area, a rapid rail network, and an underground city loop railway. MATS drew massive public opposition, as it called for the acquisition of thousands of properties and would effectively supplant a number of suburbs that were to become the sites of interchanges. Arguments broke out in Parliament, and widespread images of <a href="traffic%20congestion">gridlock</a> in overseas freeway networks contributed to the furore. Nonetheless, in early 1969 Premier <a href="Steele%20Hall">Steele Hall</a> approved implementation of the plan in a modified format, and the government began to purchase property along the proposed corridors. In mid-1969, faced with ongoing opposition, the state abandoned plans for 2 of the 10 proposed freeways. Hall was voted out of office in 1970, and the new government under Premier <a href="Don%20Dunstan">Don Dunstan</a> passed a 10-year moratorium on freeway development, effectively shelving MATS. The already-acquired corridors were retained for potential future use.

By the mid-1970s, transportation had become a problem in the north-east suburbs. The population of the <a href="City%20of%20Tea%20Tree%20Gully">Tea Tree Gully region</a> had increased from 2,500 in 1954 to 35,000 by 1971. A corridor of land along the <a href="River%20Torrens">River Torrens</a> from Adelaide to <a href="Modbury%2C%20South%20Australia">Modbury</a>, originally purchased for the Modbury Freeway proposed under the MATS plan, was the subject of a new proposal in 1973 when the State Director-General of Transport suggested building a heavy rail line that would connect the suburb to the <a href="Railways%20in%20Adelaide">Adelaide railway system</a>. A subsequent study, the "North East Adelaide Public Transport Review" (NEAPTR), considered heavy rail, <a href="light%20rail">light rail</a>, busways, and freeways, ultimately concluding that a light rail line or busway would be most viable. The state government decided on a light rail proposal to extend the historic <a href="Glenelg%20tram">Glenelg tram</a>. The new route was to continue along <a href="King%20William%20Street%2C%20Adelaide">King William Street</a> beyond what was then the terminus in <a href="Victoria%20Square%2C%20Adelaide">Victoria Square</a> and weave through the <a href="Adelaide%20Park%20Lands">Adelaide Park Lands</a> to the Modbury corridor. The light rail system would connect with feeder buses at stations along the length of the corridor to transfer passengers to suburban routes. New light rail vehicles were to be bought to replace the ageing 1929 <a href="H%20type%20Adelaide%20tram">H type trams</a>.

Public opposition to the project was broad. The <a href="City%20of%20Adelaide">Adelaide City Council</a> objected to the plan on the basis that it would interfere with the well-designed layout of the city proper. In response, the government altered the plan to redirect the line underneath the city, at a considerable increase in cost. Residents in inner-city suburbs such as <a href="St%20Peters%2C%20South%20Australia">St Peters</a> were concerned about the noise of the light rail vehicles, and protested against any disruption of the Torrens Gorge in the Modbury corridor. Test drilling commenced for the tunnel, but the entire light rail project was halted in 1980 after Premier <a href="David%20Tonkin">David Tonkin</a> appointed <a href="Michael%20Wilson%20%28Australian%20politician%29">Michael Wilson</a>, an opponent of the plan, as Transport Minister.

In search of a replacement for the light rail project, the new Government sent experts to examine an innovative guided bus system being developed in West Germany by <a href="Daimler-Benz">Daimler-Benz</a>. From the <a href="German%20language">German</a> "Omnibus" (bus) and "Bahn" (path or way, as in Autobahn for automobiles and Eisenbahn or just Bahn for railway, e.g. <a href="S-Bahn">S-Bahn</a> and <a href="Underground%20rapid%20transit">U-Bahn</a>), the O-Bahn system was developed for use in tram tunnels in <a href="Essen">Essen</a>. After extensive consultations with German authorities, <a href="State%20Transport%20Authority%20%28South%20Australia%29">State Transport Authority</a> engineers decided the O-Bahn could be used. The system was seen as far superior to previous proposals; it used less land, made less noise, was faster and cost less. In addition, its unique feature of a non-transfer service direct from suburban streets to the city centre made it more attractive. Plans were drawn up for a length of : initially only were to be constructed as O-Bahn, with the rest being conventional busway. However, safety concerns and public opposition led to O-Bahn being used for the entire length. Construction began in 1983 for the first section to <a href="Paradise%20Interchange">Paradise Interchange</a>. Another change of Government in 1982 resulted in uncertainty over the future of the project. The <a href="John%20Bannon">John Bannon</a> Government, after consultations, decided to continue with Stage 1 (City to Paradise) and in 1986 proceeded with Stage 2 (Paradise to Tea Tree Plaza). The cost of the project was <a href="Australian%20dollar">A$</a>98 million, including the buses.

The O-Bahn had more than 4 million passenger trips in the year after completion of Stage 1 in 1986, with a 30% increase the following year. When the completed O-Bahn was opened on 20 August 1989, passenger numbers rose another 17%. The Adelaide public transport system was privatised in the 1990s and overall patronage across all systems (bus, rail and tram) dropped 25%. The exception to this was the O-Bahn with no decrease, and there were 19,500 passenger trips daily in 1996 (7.13 million a year). , the busway carries approximately 31,000 people per weekday.

There have been a number of proposals to extend the O-Bahn to <a href="Golden%20Grove%2C%20South%20Australia">Golden Grove</a> or build other routes, however none have progressed beyond consultation. An extension to Golden Grove would require the acquisition of extensive tracts of private property, due to the absence of an available corridor. Population increase in the area is negligible, although sprawl continues from <a href="Tea%20Tree%20Plaza%20Interchange">Tea Tree Plaza Interchange</a> for another eight kilometres to the <a href="Adelaide%20Hills">Adelaide Hills</a>. The current route was built with an allowance for a station at <a href="Grand%20Junction%20Road%2C%20Adelaide">Grand Junction Road</a> but it has not been built.

A southern O-Bahn proposal attracted the most attention and has been the subject of various studies and Parliamentary Committees as to its viability since 1996. The rail route through Adelaide's far south is off-centre, without the large catchment area of a more central transport route. An O-Bahn running direct through the region would be able to take advantage of an already large population and the continuing growth in the area.

One suggested route for an O-Bahn was for an alignment adjacent to the <a href="Seaford%20railway%20line">Noarlunga Centre railway line</a> from the city to the <a href="Tonsley%20railway%20line">Tonsley railway line</a>. The O-Bahn would end there, with buses continuing on the <a href="Southern%20Expressway%20%28Australia%29">Southern Expressway</a> through the far south. Construction of this O-Bahn would require moving the railway track slightly to fit the O-Bahn alongside. In addition, <a href="Emerson%20Crossing">Emerson Crossing</a> and the <a href="Goodwood%20railway%20station">Goodwood</a> <a href="Glenelg%20tram">tram overpass</a> would require alteration. The estimated cost of construction, $182 million, was considered too expensive, and the proposal was suspended in 2001. Since then, the Government has focused on <a href="South%20Road%2C%20Adelaide">road upgrades</a> and an <a href="Glenelg%20tram">inner-city light rail extension</a>.

There was a 2009 plan that bus routes serving the O-Bahn would be enhanced from Hackney Road along <a href="Grenfell%20Street">Grenfell</a> and <a href="Currie%20Street">Currie Street</a>s and extended to <a href="West%20Terrace%2C%20Adelaide">West Terrace</a> on the far side of the CBD along dedicated bus lanes. However, the Federal Government announced in January 2011, as part of its response to the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Queensland%20floods">2010–11 Queensland floods</a>, that the extension would be cancelled "as a result of a significant scope reduction of the original project, resulting in only limited transport benefits".

In 2015, the <a href="Department%20of%20Planning%2C%20Transport%20and%20Infrastructure">Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure</a> announced a $160 million proposed O-Bahn City Access Project. The existing entry/exit at <a href="Hackney%20Road">Hackney Road</a> will be retained, but upgraded bus-only lanes on Hackney Road will lead to a new tunnel portal with bus guide rails commencing near the <a href="Adelaide%20Botanic%20Garden">Adelaide Botanic Garden</a>. The tunnel will pass under the <a href="Botanic%20Road%2C%20Adelaide">Botanic Road</a> intersection, then curve to the west under <a href="Rundle%20Park">Rundle Park</a>, <a href="Rundle%20Road">Rundle Road</a> and surface in <a href="Rymill%20Park">Rymill Park</a> leading to a redesigned intersection at <a href="Grenfell%20Street">Grenfell Street</a> and <a href="East%20Terrace">East Terrace</a>. Construction was anticipated to start in late 2015 with the project completed in 2017. The contract to complete the detailed design and construct the tunnel was let to <a href="McConnell%20Dowell">McConnell Dowell</a> in October 2015. <a href="SAGE%20Automation">SAGE Automation</a> will provide expertise in the mechanical and electrical aspects of the tunnel including ventilation and safety systems. Construction started in March 2016 with removal of the median strip and preparation of central bus lanes. The tunnel opened on 10 December 2017, with limited services starting the next day. The tunnel started full operation on December 17.

The O-Bahn has caused a clustering of commercial and community development near the Tea Tree Plaza Interchange, as service-providing organisations and businesses have sought to exploit the area's easy accessibility to public transport and the city centre. Market imperatives have also been aided by the zoning of the land around the area as commercial rather than residential. The area around Tea Tree Plaza is one of five designated regional centres within the Adelaide metropolis.

According to Robert Cervero, the O-Bahn has "accelerated the conversion of Tea Tree Gully from a somewhat sterile new town designed around a regional shopping mall to an emerging urban village featuring a wide range of land uses". The large <a href="Modbury%20Hospital">Modbury Hospital</a> is adjacent to the interchange, and the Torrens Valley campus of <a href="TAFE">TAFE</a> was built directly to the east of the busway after it opened. One government high school, three primary schools, one Christian school and three retirement villages are within a kilometre of the interchange. In contrast, there has been opposition to the area surrounding Klemzig Interchange and Paradise Interchange being used for any purpose other than low-density housing and no <a href="transit-oriented%20development">transit-oriented development</a> has occurred.

The construction of the O-Bahn, rather than the previously proposed Modbury Freeway, was motivated by a desire to reduce <a href="automobile%20dependency">car dependency</a>. $6 million was used for the redevelopment of the <a href="River%20Torrens">Torrens Gorge</a>, in which the <a href="Torrens%20Linear%20Park">Torrens Linear Park</a> was created. About 150,000 trees, plants and shrubs were planted alongside the track for aesthetic, environmental and noise-reduction purposes; planting was completed in 1997. Walking trails and cycling paths were built along the park to encourage public use. Torrens Linear Park rejuvenated the river, which had deteriorated to the extent of being a de facto "urban drain, littered with rubbish and inaccessible to the public". Arising from environmental considerations, the O-Bahn is <a href="Carbon%20offset">carbon-neutral</a> due to the absorption of <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> by the trees alongside it. The track itself is situated in a valley due to it being near a riverbed and the elevation was further lowered by digging further depressions in order to reduce the noise impact on adjacent dwellings.

The original buses ran on <a href="diesel%20fuel">diesel fuel</a>, but the system allows for buses that run on alternative energy sources. Biodiesel fuel and natural gas have been trialled, and 20% of the Adelaide bus fleet uses compressed natural gas, 48% <a href="B20%20%28biodiesel%29">B20</a> and 32% <a href="B5%20%28biodiesel%29">B5 biodiesel</a> blends. The design of the O-Bahn allows for the installation of <a href="overhead%20lines">overhead wires</a> for <a href="trolleybus">trolleybus</a>es.

Great North of Scotland Railway

The Great North of Scotland Railway (GNSR/GNoSR) was one of the two smallest of the five major Scottish railway companies prior to the <a href="1923%20Grouping">1923 Grouping</a>, operating in the north-east of the country. Formed in 1845, it carried its first passengers the from <a href="Kittybrewster">Kittybrewster</a>, in <a href="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>, to <a href="Huntly">Huntly</a> on 20 September 1854. By 1867 it owned of line and operated over a further .

The early expansion was followed by a period of forced economy, but in the 1880s the railway was refurbished, express services began to run and by the end of that decade there was a suburban service in Aberdeen. The railway operated its main line between Aberdeen and and two routes west to , connections could be made at both Keith and Elgin for <a href="Highland%20Railway">Highland Railway</a> services to <a href="Inverness">Inverness</a>. There were other junctions with the Highland Railway at and , and at Aberdeen connections for journeys south over the <a href="Caledonian%20Railway">Caledonian</a> and <a href="North%20British%20Railway">North British Railway</a>s. Its eventual area encompassed the three Scottish counties of <a href="Aberdeenshire">Aberdeenshire</a>, <a href="Banffshire">Banffshire</a> and <a href="County%20of%20Moray">Moray</a>, with short lengths of line in <a href="Inverness-shire">Inverness-shire</a> and <a href="Kincardineshire">Kincardineshire</a>.

Fish from the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> ports and whisky from the distilleries of <a href="Strathspey%2C%20Scotland">Speyside</a> became important goods traffic. The <a href="Royal%20Family%20of%20United%20Kingdom">Royal Family</a> used the Deeside Line for travel to and from <a href="Balmoral%20Castle">Balmoral Castle</a> and when they were in residence a daily special 'Messenger Train' ran from Aberdeen; for most of the railway's life this was its only Sunday service. The company ran three hotels, and a network of feeder bus services was developed in the early 20th century. In 1923, it became part of the <a href="London%20and%20North%20Eastern%20Railway">London and North Eastern Railway</a> as its Northern Scottish area, passing on of line and 122 steam locomotives, most of them <a href="4-4-0">4-4-0</a> tender locomotives. Although the railway had several branches, its remoteness has resulted in only its main line remaining today as part of the <a href="Aberdeen%20to%20Inverness%20Line">Aberdeen to Inverness Line</a>.

In 1845 the Great North of Scotland Railway was formed to build a railway from <a href="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> to <a href="Inverness">Inverness</a>. The proposed route, which needed few major engineering works, followed the <a href="River%20Don%2C%20Aberdeenshire">River Don</a> to <a href="Inverurie">Inverurie</a>, via <a href="Huntly">Huntly</a> and <a href="Keith%2C%20Moray">Keith</a> to a crossing of the <a href="Spey%20River%2C%20Scotland">River Spey</a>, and then to <a href="Elgin%2C%20Moray">Elgin</a> and along the coast via <a href="Nairn">Nairn</a> to Inverness. Branch lines to <a href="Banff%2C%20Aberdeenshire">Banff</a>, <a href="Portsoy">Portsoy</a>, <a href="Garmouth">Garmouth</a> and <a href="Burghead">Burghead</a> would total . At the same time the Perth & Inverness Railway proposed a direct route over the <a href="Grampian%20Mountains">Grampian Mountains</a> to <a href="Perth%2C%20Scotland">Perth</a>, and the Aberdeen, Banff & Elgin Railway suggested a route that followed the coast to better serve the <a href="Banffshire">Banffshire</a> and <a href="Morayshire">Morayshire</a> fishing ports. Three <a href="Local%20and%20Personal%20Acts%20of%20Parliament%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">private bills</a> were presented to <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament</a> seeking permission to build a railway, but the Aberdeen, Banff & Elgin failed to raise funds, and the Perth & Inverness Railway was rejected because the railway would be at altitudes that approached and needed steep gradients. The "Great North of Scotland Railway Act" received <a href="Royal%20Assent">Royal Assent</a> on 26 June 1846.

In the aftermath of the <a href="railway%20mania">railway mania</a> railway companies became an unpopular investment and the necessary finance could not be raised. The company suggested at a meeting in November 1849 that whereas £650,000 was needed for a double-track railway from Aberdeen to Inverness, only £375,000 would be needed for a single-track railway from Kittybrewster, from Aberdeen, to Keith, half way to Inverness. The meeting recommended that the bridges and works be built wide enough for a second track when this was needed. Construction eventually began in November 1852, albeit to Huntly, short of Keith, with <a href="William%20Cubitt">William Cubitt</a> as engineer. The severe winter the following year delayed work. Between Inverurie and Aberdeen the line took over the <a href="Aberdeenshire%20Canal">Aberdeenshire Canal</a>, the purchase of which delayed construction as it was necessary to settle the claims of each shareholder individually.

After an inspection by the <a href="Board%20of%20Trade">Board of Trade</a>, the railway opened to goods on 12 September 1854 and approval for the carriage of passengers was given two days later. The railway was officially opened on 19 September, and two locomotives hauling twenty-five carriages carrying 400 passengers left Kittybrewster at 11 am. The number of passengers had grown to about 650 by the time the train arrived to a celebration at Huntly at 1:12 pm. Public services began the following day.

There were stations at:

The railway was single track with <a href="passing%20loop">passing loop</a>s at the termini and at Kintore, Inverurie and Insch; the loop at Kittybrewster was clear of the platform to allow the locomotive to run round the carriages and push them into the station. A daily goods train took up to 3 hours 40 minutes for the , the goods to Aberdeen also carried passengers and mail and spared cattle a two-day drive to market. Initially there were three passenger services a day taking two hours, fares being <a href="old%20penny">old pence</a> (d) a mile for first class and d for third; on one train a day in each direction it was possible to travel for the statutory fare of 1d a mile. Although cheaper than travelling by coach, these fares and the charges for the transport of goods were considered high but not reduced for thirty years.

The railway opened short of rolling stock as only half of the twelve locomotives and twenty-four of forty passenger carriages ordered had arrived. The carriage builders, Brown, Marshall & Co of Birmingham, stated that based on their experience they had expected the line to open at least two months late. The third day after opening to passengers, on 23 September, there was a collision between two trains at Kittybrewster that resulted in the death of a passenger and several serious injuries. The inquiry found that the driver, attempting to make up time after a late start, had over-run previous stations and been approaching the terminus with excessive speed. The driver attempted to select reverse gear to slow the train but had failed to hold on to the lever, which slipped into forward, propelling the train into carriages waiting at the platform. The report also criticised the station staff, who should not have allowed the carriages to be waiting at the station. The layout at Kittybrewster was altered after the accident.

The <a href="Aberdeen%20Railway">Aberdeen Railway</a> (AR) opened from the south to <a href="Ferryhill%2C%20Aberdeen">Ferryhill</a>, south of Aberdeen, in April 1850. It had been previously arranged that the Aberdeen and Great North would amalgamate, but this was annulled that year and the Aberdeen was seeking alliances with railways to the south. In 1854 the AR opened its Guild Street terminus in Aberdeen and the Great North sought and obtained powers for a branch that followed the Aberdeenshire Canal from Kittybrewster to a terminus at <a href="Aberdeen%20Waterloo%20railway%20station">Waterloo</a> by the docks. The line was opened to goods traffic on 24 September 1855 and passengers on 1 April 1856. Kittybrewster station was rebuilt with through platforms and the offices moved to Waterloo station from premises at 75 Union Street. The stations were apart and a goods line was built though the docks linking the two railways, worked by horses as steam locomotives were prohibited.

The Inverness & Nairn Railway was authorised in 1854 to build a railway from Inverness to Nairn. The Great North, still seeking to reach Inverness, had objected but withdrew after running rights over the railway were promised. The line was opened on 6 November 1855, and Inverness & Elgin Junction Railway was formed to extend this line to Elgin. The Great North objected again, this time citing the expense of crossing the Spey, but withdrew after it was suggested that the cost of a bridge would be shared. The new company changed its name to <a href="Inverness%20%26amp%3B%20Aberdeen%20Junction%20Railway">Inverness & Aberdeen Junction Railway</a>, but no final undertaking on running rights was made.

The extension of the Great North to Keith was opened on 10 October 1856, with two intermediate stations at and <a href="Grange%20railway%20station%20%28Banffshire%29">Grange</a>. Initially five services a day ran between Aberdeen and Keith, taking between 2 hours 40 minutes and 3 hours 5 minutes, although the number of services was later reduced to four. The route between Nairn and Keith authorised on 21 July 1856 required less earthwork, reducing cost, but had steeper gradients than had originally been proposed, and the Great North contributed £40,000 towards a bridge over the Spey. The line reached <a href="Dalvey%2C%20Elgin">Dalvey</a> (near Forres) in 1857, and Keith on 18 August 1858. Three services a day ran the between Aberdeen and Inverness, increasing to five a day east of Keith, and the journey to Inverness took between 5 hours and 55 minutes and 6 hours 30 minutes. The Great North did not insist on running rights west of Keith, but through carriages were probably provided from the start.

Permission to build a line to serve the fishing ports at <a href="Peterhead">Peterhead</a> and <a href="Fraserburgh">Fraserburgh</a> was received in 1846, but this lapsed during the financial collapse that had followed. Two rival bills were presented in 1856, one by the Formartine and Buchan Railway and backed by the Great North, and another by the Aberdeen, Peterhead & Fraserburgh Railway. Both companies failed to obtain permission for two years, but in 1858 the Formartine and Buchan Railway was successful. A long railway from <a href="Dyce">Dyce</a> to Old Deer (renamed in 1867) opened on 18 July 1861 and the main line between Kittybrewster and Dyce was doubled. The branch was extended the to a <a href="Peterhead%20railway%20station">station at Peterhead</a> the following year and a long branch north from to <a href="Fraserburgh%20railway%20station">Fraserburgh station</a> opened on 24 April 1865. Three or four services a day ran between Aberdeen, Fraserburgh and Peterhead, with the trains dividing at Maud; travel times were between and hours. The railway was absorbed by the Great North of Scotland Railway on 1 August 1866.

The <a href="Alford%20Valley%20Railway%20%28GNoSR%29">Alford Valley Railway</a> left the main line at Kintore for . The railway was authorised in 1856 with the backing of the Great North; most of the company's directors were also on the board of the Great North. The line was steeply graded over a summit at Tillyfourie, at between 1 in 70 and 1 in 75. The line opened in 1859 with a service of four trains a day calling at , and . In 1862 the Great North guaranteed the company's debts and it was subsequently absorbed by the Great North of Scotland Railway on 1 August 1866.

The branch from Inverurie, backed by local residents with funding from the Great North, was authorised on 15 June 1855. The official opening took place on 26 June 1856 with public services starting on 1 July. Journeys took from 18 to 20 minutes to cover the to Old Meldrum with a stop at ; a further station opened in 1866 at . In June 1858 the line was leased to the Great North for a rental of £650 per year (). The railway was absorbed by the Great North of Scotland Railway on 1 August 1866.

Plans to reach fishing ports at Macduff and Banff from Inverurie were proposed when the Great North was first suggested, but failed because of the lack of financial support. A different route, from <a href="Milton%20Inveramsay">Milton Inveramsay</a>, allowed for a shorter route with easier gradients. Unable to raise sufficient money for a line to the coast, a shorter line to was built. The Great North invested in the railway, and directors sat on the board of the Junction Railway. The new line, together with a junction station at , opened on 5 September 1857. A separate company, the Banff, Macduff and Turriff Extension Railway, built an extension to a station called . The line was operated by the Great North from 4 June 1860, and served an inconvenient terminus high on a hill from <a href="Macduff%2C%20Aberdeenshire">Macduff</a> and from the bridge across the <a href="River%20Deveron">River Deveron</a> to Banff. Four trains a day ran from Inveramsay, taking between 1 hour 30 minutes and 1 hour 50 minutes, with connections with services to Aberdeen. Both railways were absorbed by the Great North of Scotland Railway on 1 August 1866, and the line was extended to a new station in 1872.

The railway was authorised in 1857 from Grange, on the Great North main line, to <a href="Banff%20railway%20station%20%28Aberdeenshire%29">Banff</a>, with a branch from to . The chairman of the company, Thomas Bruce, was also deputy chairman of the Inverness & Aberdeen Junction Railway, with the other directors being made up of local men; most of the investments were raised locally and in small amounts. Most of the line was built with gradients up to 1 in 70, but the half-mile of 1 in 30 goods line to the harbour at Portsoy was restricted to one locomotive and four wagons. The railway opened on 30 July 1859, with public services starting on 2 August following a derailment on the opening day. Services connected with the Great North at Grange. With the railway struggling to pay the interest on its debt, in 1863 the Great North took over running the services and the line renamed the Banffshire Railway. The Great North provided three trains a day between Grange and Banff that connected at Tillynaught for Portsoy, and two trains a day along the coast between Banff and Portsoy. Permission for a extension from Portsoy to Portgordon was given, but the necessary investment could not be found. Amalgamation with the Great North was authorised in 1866, but financial problems delayed this until 12 August 1867, and the Portgordon extension was abandoned.

The Great North sought to have its own route west of Keith, with <a href="Grantown-on-Spey">Grantown-on-Spey</a> as an objective, where it hoped to meet any possible line between Perth and Inverness. To this end, it invested in the Keith and Dufftown Railway; this company was incorporated on 27 July 1857, but lack of money slowed progress. Powers for a longer, but cheaper, route between the two towns were secured on 25 May 1860. The revised route included steeper gradients than those planned in 1857; the maximum gradient was now 1 in 60 instead of 1 in 70. There was a viaduct over the <a href="River%20Fiddich">Fiddich</a> of two spans, and there were three intermediate stations: Earlsmill (renamed in 1897), Botriphnie (renamed in 1862) and . When the line opened on 21 February 1862, the trains were worked by the Great North under an agreement dating from the formation of the company. The railway was absorbed by the Great North of Scotland Railway on 1 August 1866.

With promises of substantial goods traffic of iron and timber and from the local whisky distilleries, extension of the line to Dufftown into Strathspey was sought and obtained on 17 May 1861. The Sprathspey Railway was sponsored by the Keith & Dufftown and Great North of Scotland Railways, who appointed directors to the board, and the Great North undertook to run the services. The line first headed north to meet an extension of the Morayshire Railway at Strathspey Junction (called from 1864), before following the River Spey to <a href="Abernethy%2C%20Perth%20and%20Kinross">Abernethy</a>. The Act also permitted a branch to the proposed <a href="Inverness%20%26amp%3B%20Perth%20Junction%20Railway">Inverness & Perth Junction Railway</a> at Grantown-on-Spey. The gradients were not severe, but the route required the Spey and its tributaries to be crossed many times, with three bridges built over the river itself. The line was placed in cuttings greater than deep, and there was one long tunnel. The line was opened on 1 July 1863 to Abernethy (later called ). The line between Dufftown and Craigellachie became the main line and services continued over the Morayshire Railway, opening up a route between Keith and independent of the Inverness & Aberdeen Junction Railway (IAJR). The IAJR kept most of the through traffic as its line was more direct, only instead of via the Great North route. The Great North ran four trains a day from Elgin to Keith via Craigellachie, with through carriages or connections for three trains for Aberdeen at Keith. Connections at Elgin were poor because travel over the two routes took a different length of time.

The line from Craigellachie became a branch with three trains a day calling at all stations at an average speed of about . The link to Grantown-on-Spey was not built, but on 1 August 1866 services were extended to meet the IAJR (now the <a href="Highland%20Railway">Highland Railway</a>) at . The railways met north of Boat and conflict arose over the manning of the signalbox at the junction, with the Highland refusing to make any contribution. For a while between March and June 1868 Great North services terminated at Nethy Bridge, after which separate tracks side by side were provided for both companies to Boat. Prompt connections were available with the Great North at Craigellachie, but there was usually a long wait for connections with the Highland at Boat. The railway's was absorbed by the Great North of Scotland Railway on 1 August 1866, and the line's main source of income came from the local distilleries.

A double-track railway had been proposed from <a href="Lossiemouth">Lossiemouth</a> to <a href="Craigellachie%2C%20Moray">Craigellachie</a> in 1841 and necessary permissions granted in 1846, the route having changed to take advantage of the proposed Great North of Scotland Railway between Elgin and Orton. The financial situation delayed construction, but work eventually started on the section from Lossiemouth to Elgin in 1851. The line opened on 10 August 1852 with a special train from Elgin to festivities in Lossiemouth. Public services started the next day with five services a day, each taking 15 minutes with two request stops. First and second class accommodation was provided at d and 1d a mile. However, it was the Inverness & Aberdeen Junction Railway (IAJR) who was to build the line from Elgin to Orton; permission to build a branch from this line to <a href="Rothes">Rothes</a> was granted to the Morayshire on 14 July 1856. The IAJR built its own station at Elgin, linked to the Morayshire's station by a junction to the east. The IAJR opened on 18 August 1858 and the Morayshire Railway started running services on 23 August.

Initially the Morayshire ran trains over the IAJR, but its lightweight locomotives struggled with the gradients and proved unreliable, and after six weeks carriages were attached and detached from IAJR trains at Elgin and Orton. Conflict arose over through ticketing, and the directors of the Morayshire responded with plans to build its own line between the two stations. The Great North sponsored the new line and offered to provide services after the lines had been physically connected. Permission was granted on 3 July 1860, goods were carried from 30 December 1861 and passengers from 1 January 1862, reducing the travel time from 55 minutes to 45 minutes. The Morayshire station at Elgin was enlarged in anticipation of Great North services, albeit in wood.

In 1861 permission was granted to the Morayshire Railway to cross the Spey and join with the Strathspey Railway at Craigellachie. The Morayshire extension and the Strathspey both opened on 1 July 1863 and the Great North provided a service of four trains a day over the line, which gave an alternative route between Keith and Elgin. On 30 July 1866 permission was given to the Morayshire and Great North to amalgamate with agreement, and the loss-making services between Orton and Rothes were withdrawn without notice the following day. It would be August 1881 before the Morayshire became fully part of the Great North.

The wooden station building at Waterloo was a from the Aberdeen and Deeside's Guild Street station and passengers were conveyed between the termini by omnibus, paid for in the through fare and with forty five minutes being allowed for the transfer. The Great North refused to hold its trains to connect with those arriving at Guild Street and insisted that tickets were purchased at least five minutes before the train was due to depart. The mail train would be held until the Post Office van had arrived and the mail was on board, but the station locked at the advertised departure time to prevent connecting passengers further delaying the train. This inconvenienced passengers, as was pointed out to the general manager during a parliamentary committee meeting by a <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> who had missed a connection, although his family and luggage had been sent on. The Great North promoted onward traffic by sea and approached the <a href="Aberdeen%20Steam%20Navigation%20Company">Aberdeen Steam Navigation Company</a> to see if rates could be reduced for through traffic and through ticketing by rail was not available until 1859, when the Great North joined the <a href="Railway%20Clearing%20House">Railway Clearing House</a>.

A joint line through the Denburn Valley to link the Great North to the south had been planned, and the Great North had approached the railways using the Guild Street station in 1853 and 1857 but were unhappy with the assistance that had been offered. Permission was granted in 1861 to the Inverness & Perth Junction Railway to build a line from , on the Inverness & Aberdeen Junction Railway, direct to Perth. The Great North protested, and won the right for a booking office in Inverness. The line opened in 1863 and in 1865 the Inverness & Perth Junction and Inverness & Aberdeen Junction merged to become the Highland Railway. The Aberdeen Railway, which had now been absorbed by the <a href="Scottish%20North%20Eastern%20Railway">Scottish North Eastern Railway</a> (SNER), approached the Great North, concerned that the new line had bypassed Aberdeen, but no agreement was reached.

The Limpet Mill Scheme was a line presented in an 1862 bill by the nominally independent Scottish Northern Junction Railway, but supported by the SNER. This proposed a long railway between Limpet Mill, to the north of on the SNER, to the Great North at Kintore. A junction with the Deeside Railway was also planned, over which the SNER unsuccessfully tried to obtain running rights. Unpopular, this was given permission by parliament, but the Great North succeeded in inserting a clause that this would be suspended if it obtained an Act by 1 September 1863. The Great North proposed a route, known locally as the "Circumbendibus", that was longer but cheaper than the direct route through the Denburn Valley. Despite local opposition, the route was approved by parliament in 1863, but was revoked the following year when the SNER obtained permission for a railway through the Denburn Valley. The Great North contributed the £125,000 that its Circumbendibus line would have cost and the SNER contributed £70,000 out of the £90,000 it had been prepared to advance the Limpet Mill Scheme. The SNER built the double-track railway, culverting the Denburn and digging two short tunnels. The joint station opened on 4 November 1867 and consisted of three through tracks, one with a long platform, together with two bay platforms for terminating trains at either end. Two lines to the west were provided for goods traffic, and the stations at Waterloo and Guild Street closed to passengers and became goods terminals. The line to the north of the station passed to the Great North and the long Hutcheon Street tunnel became its longest.

A railway to serve <a href="River%20Dee%2C%20Aberdeenshire">Deeside</a> was authorised on 16 July 1846, but it was decided to wait for the Aberdeen Railway to open first. The company survived after the railway mania as the Aberdeen Railway bought a large number of shares. Interest in the line was restored after <a href="Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort">Prince Albert</a> purchased <a href="Balmoral%20Castle">Balmoral Castle</a>, to which the Royal Family made their first visit in 1848, and the Aberdeen Railway was able to sell its shares. Investors were still hard to find, but a line as far as <a href="Banchory">Banchory</a> was ceremonially opened on 7 September 1853; public services began the following day with three trains a day that took about an hour. First class accommodation was available for d a mile, reduced to 1d a mile for third class. Initially services were operated by the Aberdeen Railway to its terminus at Ferryhill, and the Deeside Railway used a horse to shunt wagons at Banchory. In 1854 the Deeside introduced its own rolling stock and ran through to the Aberdeen's Guild Street station which opened the same year.

A new company, the Aboyne Extension, was formed to reach . Instead of building two bridges across the Dee, as had been proposed in 1846, the railway instead took a cheaper but longer route through <a href="Lumphanan">Lumphanan</a>, and services were extended over the new line on 2 December 1859. The Aboyne & Braemar Railway was formed to build a line from Aboyne the to <a href="Braemar">Braemar</a>. The line was to follow the Dee before crossing it from Braemar, but the plans were modified to terminate the line at <a href="Bridge%20of%20Gairn">Bridge of Gairn</a> with the passenger terminus short at . This route opened to Ballater on 17 October 1866, and the line to Bridge of Gairn remained unfinished. By 1855 there five services a day over the long line, taking between 1 hour 50 minutes and hours.

The Royal Family used the line from 1853 to travel to Balmoral Castle; in September 1866 the <a href="British%20Royal%20Train">British Royal Train</a> used Ballater station nearly a month before public services reached the station. At first <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> visited once a year, this becoming twice a year after Albert died in 1861. The number of visits returned to one a year after <a href="Edward%20VII">Edward VII</a> became king in 1901. From 8 October 1865 a daily 'Messenger Train' ran when the Royal Family was at Balmoral. First class accommodation was available on these trains; accompanying servants were charged third class fares. In the late 1850s and early 1860s the Great North and the Scottish North Eastern Railway (SNER) were in conflict over the joint station in Aberdeen. Frustrated with lack of progress, the SNER proposed a new line that crossed the Deeside Railway. Whilst in discussions with the SNER about a link from this new line to the Deeside, a lease for the Deeside Railway was offered to the Great North, which was rapidly accepted. The Deeside board accepted the lease by a majority vote on 13 May 1862, and it was approved by Parliament on 30 July 1866. The Aboyne & Braemar remained independent, although services were operated by the Great North.

After opening to Keith in 1854 the Great North of Scotland Railway operated over of line. Ten years later this had almost quadrupled but more than three-quarters was over leased or subsidiary railways. Eventual amalgamation with many of these railways had been prompted from the start. The necessary authority was sought and on 30 July 1866 the "Great North of Scotland Railway (Amalgamation) Act" received Royal Assent, this Act also permitting the Great North to lease the Deeside Railway. The other companies merged two days later, except the Banffshire and Morayshire, which had started as separate undertakings and were not included in the 1866 Act, although permission for the Banffshire to merge was gained the following year. After the extension of the Deeside opened in 1866 and the merger of the Banffshire the following year the Great North of Scotland Railway owned of line and operated over a further .

In 1855, the first full year after opening, the Great North of Scotland declared a <a href="dividend">dividend</a> of per cent, which rose to the following year and 5 per cent in 1859. The dividend reached a maximum of per cent in 1862 before dropping to 7 per cent the following year and 5 per cent in 1864, but in 1865 the directors could not pay any dividend on ordinary shares. At the directors' suggestion a committee was set up to look into their actions; the report's main recommendation was the abandonment of the Port Gordon extension. The opening of direct route over the Highland Railway to the south had lost the through mail business, resulting in the withdrawal of Sunday services, and had lost revenue equivalent to a five per cent dividend. Joining the Clearing House system had resulted in the loss of twenty-five per cent of goods traffic income and the conflict over the joint station in Aberdeen had been expensive and resulted in an overpriced lease on the Deeside. The collapse of <a href="Overend%2C%20Gurney%20and%20Company">Overend, Gurney and Company</a> Bank in 1866 meant that for three months the bank rate rose to 10 per cent, making the company's financial situation worse.

The whole board resigned and six members did not seek re-appointment. At the beginning of 1867 the company owed £800,000 () and the new board imposed austerity measures. It would be 1874 before most of the company's debt was settled and it became possible to pay a dividend again. The only line built in the early 70s was the to Macduff and few carriages and no locomotives were built until 1876. The Deeside Railway merged in 1875, the Aboyne & Braemar extension to Ballater in January 1876, and the Morayshire Railway was absorbed in 1880. After an engine boiler exploded at Nethy Bridge in September 1878, the inquiry found the testing of boilers infrequent and inadequate. It was sixteen months before the locomotive was repaired.

In 1879 the Chairman, Lord Provost Leslie, died and was replaced by William Ferguson of Kinmundy. The following year both the Secretary and General Manager resigned and William Moffatt was appointed to both posts, and A.G. Reid became Superintendent of the Line. The railway was now paying a dividend and seeing increased traffic, but rolling stock, track, signals and stations all needed replacing in a project that was to cost £250,000 (). By June 1880 the main line was doubled as far as Kintore, and over the next five years of iron rail track, much of it without <a href="fishplates">fishplates</a>, was replaced with steel rails and the main line doubled to Inveramsay. The railway had acquired a reputation for running slow trains on a perverse timetable and ill-treating its passengers, and now resolved to address this. By the mid-1880s services were faster, there was upholstery in third class and the branches saw an accelerated service as a result of running fewer mixed trains.

On 27 November 1882 Inverythan Bridge on the Macduff Branch near collapsed as a locomotive hauling five goods wagons, a brake van and four carriages crossed. The locomotive and tender crossed the bridge, but the wagons and carriages fell to the road below, killing five people who had been travelling in the first and second carriages and injuring fifteen others. The Board of Trade report found that the collapse was due to an internal fault in a cast iron beam that had been fitted when the bridge had been built in 1857.

A bill was introduced to parliament in 1881 to extend the line from Portsoy along the <a href="Moray%20Firth">Moray Firth</a> to <a href="Buckie">Buckie</a>, to be opposed by the Highland and rejected. The following year both the Great North and Highland railways applied to parliament, the Great North for a line from Portsoy along the coast through Buckie to Elgin, and the Highland for a branch from Keith to Buckie and <a href="Cullen%2C%20Moray">Cullen</a>. Authority was granted, but in the case of the Highland Railway only for a line as far as <a href="Portessie">Portessie</a>, with running rights over the Great North coast line between Buckie and Portsoy and the Great North obtaining reciprocal rights over the Highland railway between Elgin and Forres. The coast line opened in stages, the outer sections from Portsoy to Tochieneal and Elgin to Garmouth opening in 1884. The centre section, which involved heavy engineering, with a long viaduct with a central span of over the Spey at Garmouth and embankments and viaducts at Cullen, opened in May 1886. The line was served by four trains a day and a fast through train from Aberdeen that reached Elgin in hours. The Highland Portessie branch had opened in 1884 and the Highland did not exercise its running rights over the Coast Line, thus preventing the Great North running over its lines west of Elgin.

The Great North had opened using a system of telegraphic train orders, and as the signalling was being upgraded this was being replaced with electric tablet working over the single line sections. Now express trains had to slow to exchange tokens in a process that frequently left railwaymen injured, so James Manson, the locomotive superintendent, designed an automatic token exchange system based on apparatus used to move cotton in a factory. At first tokens were exchanged at , but soon they were exchanged at line speed. After trialling on the Fraserburgh line, the system was installed on the coast route in May 1889, and by 1 January 1893 it was in operation on all single-line sections.

The Great North and Highland had agreed in 1865 that Keith would be the exchange point for traffic between the two railways, but in 1886 the Great North had two lines to Elgin that, although longer than the Highland's direct line, served more populous areas. The coastal route between Keith and Elgin was long but had easier gradients than the via Craigellachie. The Highland's main line south from Inverness was via Forres, the Great North believing that their competitors treated the line to Elgin as a branch. In 1883 a shorter route south from Inverness was promoted by an independent company, the bill defeated in parliament only after the Highland had promised to request authority for a shorter line. The following year, as well as the Highland's more direct line from Aviemore, the Great North proposed a branch from its Speyside Section to Inverness. The Highland Railway route was chosen, but the Great North won a concession that goods and passengers that could be exchanged at any junction with through bookings and with services conveniently arranged.
In 1885 the Great North re-timed the 10:10 am Aberdeen service to reach Keith at 11:50 am with through carriages that reached Elgin via Craigellachie at 1 pm. This connected with a Highland service at both Keith and Elgin, until the Highland re-timed the train and broke the connection at Elgin. The Great North applied to the Board of Trade for an order for two connections a day at Elgin. This was refused, but in 1886 the Great North and Highland railways came to an agreement to pool receipts from the stations between Grange and Elgin and refer any disputes to an arbiter. The midday Highland train was re-timed to connect with the Great North at Keith and Elgin, and a service connected at Elgin with an Aberdeen train that had divided en route to travel via the coast and Craigellachie.

In 1893 the Highland cancelled the traffic agreement and withdrew two connecting trains, complaining that they were unprofitable. One of the trains was reinstated after an appeal was made to the <a href="Railway%20%26amp%3B%20Canal%20Commissioners">Railway & Canal Commissioners</a> and a frustrated Great North applied to parliament in 1895 for running powers to Inverness, but withdrew after it was agreed that the Railway & Canal Commissioners would arbitrate in the matter. With no judgement by 1897, the Great North prepared to apply again for running powers over the Highland to Inverness, this time agreeing to double track the line, but the commissioners published their finding before the bill was submitted to parliament. Traffic was to be exchanged at both Elgin and Keith, the services exchanged at Elgin needed to include through carriages from both the Craigellachie and the coast routes, and the timetable had to be approved by the commissioners. The resulting Commissioners' Service started in 1897 with eight through services, four via the Highland to Keith taking between and 5 hours, and four with carriages exchanged at Elgin with portions that travelled via Craigellachie and the coast, two of these taking hours. The 3 pm from Inverness to Aberdeen via Keith took 3 hours 5 minutes. Initially portions for the coast and Craigellachie divided at Huntly, but Cairnie Platform was opened at Grange Junction in summer 1898. The main line was double track to Huntly in 1896 and Keith in 1898, except for a single-track bridge over the Deveron between Avochie and Rothiemay, which was replaced by a double-track bridge in 1900.

In 1880 an express was introduced on the Deeside Line, taking 90 minutes to travel from Aberdeen to Ballater; by 1886 this had reduced to 75 minutes. In 1887 the service between Aberdeen and Dyce had improved with more local trains and new stations; by the end of that year there were twelve trains a day, eventually becoming twenty trains a day calling at nine stops in twenty minutes. The trains were initially called the "Jubilees", as it was <a href="Golden%20Jubilee%20of%20Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee</a>, but became known as the "Subbies". Suburban services were also introduced between Aberdeen and Culter on the Deeside Line in 1894, after the track had been doubled, starting with ten down and nine up trains calling at seven stops in twenty-two minutes. The number of trains was eventually doubled and an additional station provided.

In 1891 the company offices were moved from Waterloo to a new building in Guild Street with direct access to the station. The same year the Great North took over the Palace Hotel (closed after a fire in 1941), near the joint railway station in Aberdeen and modernised it, installing electric lighting and building a covered way between the hotel and station. Encouraged by its success, the company obtained permission in 1893 to build an hotel and golf course at <a href="Cruden%20Bay">Cruden Bay</a>, about north of Aberdeen. The hotel was linked to the Great North by the <a href="Boddam%20Branch">Boddam Branch</a>, a new single-track branch from Ellon, on the Buchan section, which served Cruden Bay and fishing town at <a href="Boddam%2C%20Aberdeenshire">Boddam</a>. The line opened in 1897 with services from Ellon taking about forty minutes. The hotel opened in 1899, connected to the railway station by the <a href="Cruden%20Bay%20Hotel%20Tramway">Cruden Bay Hotel Tramway</a>. This was nearly long, with a gauge of and operated by electric tramcars that took power from an overhead line. Seasonal through services to Aberdeen began in 1899 with an up service in the morning; for some years an afternoon up service returned in the evening. Excursions for tourists had operated on the Deeside Line from 1881, later joined by special services on the Strathspey Line and the Coast Line alongside the Moray Firth, promoted as the "Scottish Riviera".

There was interest at the end of the 19th century in using the new "<a href="Light%20Railways%20Act%201896">Light Railways Act 1896</a>" to approve lines to serve rural areas. The long Aberdeenshire Light Railway was independently promoted in 1896 to serve <a href="Skene%2C%20Aberdeenshire">Skene</a> and <a href="Echt%2C%20Aberdeenshire">Echt</a>, with tracks laid along the public roads in Aberdeen. The Great North proposed an alternative Echt Light Railway and a line to <a href="Newburgh%2C%20Aberdeenshire">Newburgh</a> that would both use the <a href="Aberdeen%20tramway">Aberdeen tramway</a> tracks in the city. In 1897 a line from Echt to Aberdeen was approved, but only as far the city outskirts after opposition to laying tracks in the public roads or using the tramways for goods traffic. The plans were changed to connect the line with the Great North at Kittybrewster, but the scheme abandoned after the costs had started to rise.

The Great North was granted a <a href="Light%20Railway%20Order">Light Railway Order</a> on 8 September 1899 for a light railway from Fraserburgh to <a href="St%20Combs">St Combs</a>. The Order included a clause, unusual for the time, permitting the use of electric traction; but the company opted for steam traction, and the locomotives were fitted with <a href="Cow%20catcher">cowcatchers</a> as the line was unfenced. Services started on 1 July 1903, with six trains a day that took 17 minutes to complete the journey. A light railway was proposed to cover the from Fraserburgh to <a href="Rosehearty">Rosehearty</a>, but the scheme was abandoned after opposition to laying tracks on the public road.

Finding its locomotive works at Kittybrewster cramped and inadequate, the Great North began construction on a new <a href="Inverurie%20Locomotive%20Works">works at Inverurie</a> in 1898, electric lighting being provided in the buildings. The carriage and wagon department moved in 1901, the locomotive department in 1902, the offices the following year and the permanent way department in 1905; the buildings still stand and are <a href="Listed%20building">listed</a> Category B. Inverurie station was rebuilt nearer the works in 1902, and is similarly a Category B building. The Great North built houses nearby for its staff, lit by electricity generated at the works, and the <a href="Inverurie%20Loco%20Works%20F.C.">Inverurie Loco Works Football Club</a> was formed by staff in 1902.

The Great North rebuilt Elgin station in 1902 to replace a temporary wooden building dating from the 1860s, a joint structure with the adjacent station having been declined by the Highland Railway. Following negotiations, amalgamation of the Highland and the Great North of Scotland Railways was accepted by the Great North shareholders in early 1906, but the Highland board withdrew after opposition from a minority of its shareholders. The Aberdeen and Inverness trains were jointly worked after 1908 and locomotives were no longer exchanged at Keith or Elgin; between 1914 and 1916 the Highland paid the Great North to provide locomotives for all of the services through to Inverness.

In spring 1904 the Great North began a motor omnibus service to Braemar, connecting with trains at Ballater. These early buses had solid tyres and a legal speed limit of , but were faster than the horse-drawn coaches they replaced. By 1907 buses connected with Great North train services and conveyed passengers to <a href="Strathdon">Strathdon</a>, <a href="Midmar">Midmar</a>, Echt, <a href="Cluny%20Castle">Cluny Castle</a> and <a href="Aberchirder">Aberchirder</a>, between <a href="Cock%20Bridge%20%28Aberdeenshire%29">Cock Bridge</a> and <a href="Tomintoul">Tomintoul</a> a horse-drawn coach was used as the motor buses could not ascend the steep road. Services from Aberdeen connected with trains at , where a refreshment room was built. In 1914 the railway had 35 passenger road vehicles that, together with 15 five-ton lorries, worked daily.

Aberdeen joint station was congested, resulting in delayed trains, and the low, open platforms were frequently covered in oily slime due to the large quantities of fish that passed through. Agreement with the <a href="Caledonian%20Railway">Caledonian Railway</a> over rebuilding the station had been reached in 1899, but the companies fell out over widening the line to the south. Moving the goods station to the east was similarly complex, with conflicts with the harbour commissioners and the town council. In 1908 new platforms on the western side opened and the adjoining station hotel was bought in 1910. Foundations for the new building were laid in 1913 and the station was largely complete by July 1914, although outbreak of war delayed further progress and the station was finally completed in 1920.

With <a href="World%20War%20I">Britain's declaration of war</a> on the German Empire on 4 August 1914, the government took control of the railways under the "Regulation of the Forces Act 1871". Day-to-day operations were left in the control of local management, but movements necessary for the war were coordinated by a committee of general managers. The Great North of Scotland's main role was providing a relief route when the Highland Railway route south to Perth was congested, on one Sunday conveying twenty-one troop specials from Keith to Aberdeen. Timber from the forests of the north of Scotland were carried from sidings at Kemnay, Knockando and Nethy Bridge. A total of 609 staff left to serve in the war, and a memorial to the 93 who died in action was erected at the offices in Aberdeen. Services were maintained until 1916, when staff shortages reduced services, although no lines were closed.

The railways were in a poor state after the war, costs having increased, with higher wages, the introduction of an <a href="eight-hour%20day">eight-hour day</a> and increased price of coal. A scheme was devised whereby the railways would be grouped into four large companies; this was approved by parliament as the "<a href="Railways%20Act%201921">Railways Act 1921</a>". At the start of the 20th century the company's shares had been restructured; the final dividends were 3 per cent on preferred stock, unaltered from previously, and per cent on ordinary stock, slightly above average. Before grouping the Great North of Scotland Railway operated of track.

On 1 January 1923 the Great North of Scotland became an isolated part of the Scottish division of the <a href="London%20and%20North%20Eastern%20Railway">London and North Eastern Railway</a> (LNER), the Caledonian to the south and Highland to the west both becoming part of a different group, the <a href="London%2C%20Midland%20and%20Scottish%20Railway">London, Midland and Scottish Railway</a>. That summer a sleeping carriage operated between Lossiemouth and , and a through carriage ran from to Cruden Bay on Fridays. Sunday services were re-introduced; from 1928 Aberdeen suburban services ran hourly during the afternoon and evenings. Afterwards the economic situation deteriorated and the railway companies advised the trade unions in 1928 that wages would need to be cut; this was implemented in August 1930 after the <a href="Wall%20Street%20Crash">Wall Street Crash</a> the previous year. Economy measures were introduced and unprofitable passenger services withdrawn, the Oldmeldrum branch closing on 2 November 1931 and the branch to Cruden Bay and Boddam on 31 October 1932. Road transport was arranged for guests at the Cruden Bay hotel, from Ellon for the first summer season, and then from Aberdeen.

Carriages were transferred in to replace the older four-wheelers, former <a href="North%20Eastern%20Railway%20%28UK%29">North Eastern Railway</a> vehicles in 1924–25 and fifty former <a href="Great%20Eastern%20Railway">Great Eastern Railway</a> six-wheelers between 1926 and 1929 for the Aberdeen suburban services. By 1936 more up to date <a href="Nigel%20Gresley">Gresley</a> bogie carriages were used on the primary trains. Optimism returned and traffic increased after 1933, and a luxury rail land cruise, the "Northern Belle", ran over former Great North lines. However, the Aberdeen subbies had been losing money for some time as a result of competition from the local buses, and from 5 April 1937 the local services between Aberdeen, Dyce and Culter were withdrawn and most of the intermediate stations closed.

The railways were again placed under government control on 1 September 1939, and <a href="World%20War%20II">Britain was at war</a> two days later. The Cruden Bay Hotel was used as an army hospital and the tramway ceased operating in 1941. Handed back to the railway in 1945, it never reopened. The Palace Hotel burnt down in 1941. The Station Hotel was used as an admiralty administrative centre, and reopened in 1950 after refurbishment.

Britain's railways were nationalised on 1 January 1948 and the former Great North of Scotland Railway lines were placed under the control of the <a href="Scottish%20Region">Scottish Region</a> of <a href="British%20Railways">British Railways</a>. To reduce costs the Alford branch was closed to passengers on 2 January 1950, followed by the Macduff Branch on 1 October 1951.
The <a href="1955%20Modernisation%20Plan">1955 Modernisation Plan</a>, known formally as the "Modernisation and Re-Equipment of the British Railways", was published in December 1954, and with the aim of increasing speed and reliability the steam trains were replaced with electric and diesel traction. In 1958 a battery-electric railcar was introduced on the Deeside Line and a diesel railbus on the Speyside Section. <a href="Diesel%20Multiple%20Unit">Diesel Multiple Unit</a>s (DMU) took over services to Peterhead and Fraserburgh in 1959 and from 1960 cross-country types were used on an accelerated Aberdeen to Inverness service that allowed hours for four stops. By 1961 the only service still using steam locomotives was the branch from Tillynaught to Banff.

In 1963 <a href="Dr%20Beeching">Dr Beeching</a> published his report "The Reshaping of British Railways", which recommended closing the network's least used stations and lines. Only the Aberdeen to Keith main line survived, albeit without its stopping services and the remaining former Great North lines closed to passengers. The Lossiemouth and Banff branch closed in 1964 and the following year the St Combs branch, line from Dyce to Peterhead and Fraserburgh and the Speyside section closed and local services to Inverurie were withdrawn. Attempts to save the Deeside section to Banchory failed and it closed in 1966. On 6 May 1968 services were withdrawn on the Coast Line, the former Great North line via Craigellachie and the local services between Aberdeen and Elgin. The Beeching Report had recommended Inverurie and Insch stations for closure, but these were saved by the subsequent inquiry.

The goods service at individual stations was also withdrawn after Beeching's report. A <a href="Freightliner%20Group">freightliner</a> depot opened at Aberdeen in 1966, allowing the Peterhead line to close completely on 7 September 1970. In 1969–70 the line between Aberdeen and Keith was singled, with passing loops, the line to Fraserburgh closing completely in 1979 and that from Keith to Dufftown in 1985. In the 1969 timetable there were early morning trains between Aberdeen and Inverurie, and five services a day between Aberdeen to Inverness, supplemented by two Aberdeen to Elgin services that by the late 1970s were running through to Inverness. The cross-country DMUs were replaced in 1980 by diesel locomotives hauling <a href="British%20Railways%20Mark%201">Mark I compartment coaches</a>, later <a href="British%20Railways%20Mark%202">Mark II open saloons</a>. These were similarly replaced in the late 1980s and early 1990s by newer DMUs, first the <a href="British%20Rail%20Class%20156">Class 156 "Super Sprinter"</a> and then <a href="British%20Rail%20Class%20158">Class 158 "Express"</a> and <a href="British%20Rail%20Class%20170">Class 170</a> units.

The <a href="Aberdeen%20to%20Inverness%20Line">Aberdeen to Inverness Line</a> currently uses the former Great North of Scotland Railway line as far Keith with stations at Dyce, Inverurie, Insch, Huntly and Keith. Eleven trains a day run between Aberdeen and Inverness, taking about hours, supplemented between Aberdeen and Inverurie by approximately the same number of local trains. In a project scheduled for completion in 2030, the line is to be improved to allow a regular hourly Aberdeen to Inverness service, additional commuter trains into Inverness and Aberdeen and new stations at Kintore and Dalcross, near Inverness airport.

Heritage and tourist railways also use the former Great North of Scotland Railway alignment. The <a href="Keith%20and%20Dufftown%20Railway">Keith and Dufftown Railway</a> runs seasonal services over the between Keith Town and Dufftown using <a href="British%20Rail%20Class%20108">Class 108</a> diesel multiple units. The <a href="Strathspey%20Railway%20%28preserved%29">Strathspey Railway</a> operates seasonal services over the former Highland Railway route from to <a href="Grantown%20on%20Spey%20%28West%29%20railway%20station">Grantown-on-Spey</a> via the joint Highland and Great North Boat of Garten station. The <a href="Royal%20Deeside%20Railway">Royal Deeside Railway</a> operates over of former Deeside Railway at Milton of Crathes near Banchory during summer weekends and in December, and based at Alford railway station is the <a href="Alford%20Valley%20Railway">Alford Valley Railway</a>, which seasonally operates a narrow gauge railway.

Former alignments have been opened as long distance <a href="rail%20trails">rail trails</a> for pedestrians, cyclists and horses. The <a href="Formartine%20and%20Buchan%20Way">Formartine and Buchan Way</a> runs from <a href="Dyce">Dyce</a> to <a href="Maud%2C%20Aberdeenshire">Maud</a> before dividing to follow the two branches to Peterhead and Fraserburgh. The <a href="Deeside%20Way">Deeside Way</a> is open between Aberdeen and <a href="Kincardine%20O%27Neil">Kincardine O'Neil</a> and <a href="Aboyne">Aboyne</a> and <a href="Ballater">Ballater</a>.

<a href="NESTRANS">Nestrans</a> (The North East of Scotland Transport Partnership), the organization responsible for local transport strategy, consider that building new railways along these routes would not be beneficial at the moment but the alignments are protected from development. The <a href="Speyside%20Way">Speyside Way</a>, one of Scotland's <a href="Long%20Distance%20Route">Long Distance Route</a>s, mostly follows the route of the Speyside section between Craigellachie and Ballindalloch and Grantown and Nethy Bridge.

The first locomotives were <a href="2-4-0">2-4-0</a> tender engines, built by <a href="William%20Fairbairn%20%26amp%3B%20Sons">Wm Fairbairn</a> in Manchester to the design of the locomotive superintendent <a href="Daniel%20Kinnear%20Clark">Daniel Kinnear Clark</a>. Twelve were ordered for the opening of the first line, seven passenger and five goods. They were all fitted with Clark's patent smoke preventing system that improved fuel economy and painted green with black borders, and red buffer beams. There was no protection for the driver or fireman and braking was by wooden blocks on the four wheels of the tender. The railway opened with only five locomotives, and within days one had been seriously damaged in the collision at and a second had a mechanical fault. Two more locomotives had arrived by the end of 1854, and the order was complete by summer 1855. Four more passenger locomotives were ordered in 1857, weatherboards and sanding equipment had been fitted by 1860, and cabs added in the 1880s. <a href="John%20Folds%20Ruthven">John Folds Ruthven</a> replaced Clark in 1855 and an order was placed with <a href="Beyer%2C%20Peacock%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">Beyer, Peacock & Co.</a> for two <a href="0-4-0">0-4-0</a> tank engines to <a href="bank%20engine">bank</a> trains on the line to <a href="Aberdeen%20Waterloo%20railway%20station">Waterloo</a> near Aberdeen harbour. After <a href="William%20Cowan%20%28engineer%29">William Cowan</a> became locomotive superintendent nine more locomotives arrived in 1859–61. These were followed by nine <a href="4-4-0">4-4-0</a>s, also built by <a href="Robert%20Stephenson%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">R. Stephenson & Co.</a>, and delivered between 1862 and 1864. Six more powerful 4-4-0 locomotives arrived from Neilsons in 1866, and were fitted with a more modern bogie. Three passed to the <a href="London%20and%20North%20Eastern%20Railway">London and North Eastern Railway</a> after the <a href="1923%20Grouping">1923 Grouping</a>, and No. 45 hauled a train at the Railway Centenary celebrations in 1925 before being scrapped.

In 1863 the Great North took over the operation of the <a href="Banffshire%20Railway">Banffshire</a> and <a href="Morayshire%20Railway">Morayshire Railway</a>s and absorbed their locomotives. The Banffshire had four locomotives, two 0-4-2 tanks, named "Banff" and "Portsoy", built by Hawthorns of Leith for the line's opening in 1859. The other two locomotives were 0-4-2 tender engines, one bought secondhand from the <a href="Scottish%20Central%20Railway">Scottish Central Railway</a>, having been built in 1848 by the Vulcan Foundry in Warrington and named "Keith", and a similar tender engine built by Hawthorns. The <a href="Morayshire%20Railway">Morayshire Railway</a> had started services in 1852 with two <a href="2-2-0">2-2-0</a> engines designed by <a href="James%20Samuel">James Samuel</a> and built by Neilsons. The locomotives had proved inadequate and were replaced by two larger 2-4-0 tank engines. The Great North took over the operation of the <a href="Deeside%20Railway">Deeside Railway</a> in 1866. Its first two locomotives were 0-4-2 tank engines, built by Hawthorns and arrived in 1854. No. 3, a tender locomotive, was delivered in 1854 from <a href="Isaac%20Dodds%20and%20Son">Dodds & Son</a> of Rotherham, but this had mechanical defects and was never satisfactory. Between 1857 and 1866 four 0-4-2 tender locomotives arrived from Hawthorns; these were similar to the Banffshire's Nos. 3 and 4; the Deeside also bought the Banffshire's No. 4 in 1864. One of these locomotives was given a large six-wheeled tender to allow it to haul the Royal Trains from Aberdeen to without stopping. The tender locomotives were found to be unstable at high speeds were all withdrawn by 1880.
The company's financial difficulties after 1866 had precluded the purchasing of any more locomotives until six 4-4-0 locomotives were built in 1876 by Neilson's, partly to replace the Deeside locomotives. These had larger boilers and fireboxes than previous locomotives and were the first to be built with cabs. The next twelve locomotives had rounded splashers over the trailing driving wheels, meaning the shape of the cab was different, but retained the brass dome on the firebox, copper capped chimney and had brass bands joining the firebox and boiler. After <a href="James%20Manson%20%28engineer%29">James Manson</a> became locomotive superintendent in 1883 he introduced a more contemporary design of locomotive, with inside cylinders and doors on the side of cabs and without brass domes or copper chimneys. The first six were built by Kitson & Co in Leeds in 1884, followed by three similar but lighter in 1885. The railway had inherited most of its tank engines from the Deeside, Morayshire and Banffshire Railways and these needed replacing, so six arrived in 1884 and three slightly larger the following year. The first tank engines in the country to be fitted with doors on the cabs, these worked on the suburban services and one was fitted with a cowcatcher to work the St Combs Light Railway at <a href="Fraserburgh">Fraserburgh</a>. In 1887 two locomotives were built at Kittybrewster works. Although there was only space for four locomotives in the cramped repair shops the board expected to save £300 to £400 by building the locomotives themselves. Nine express locomotives with six-wheeled tenders were built by Kitsons in 1888 and these were followed by six more with eight-wheeled tenders built by Stephenson & Co, one of which was successfully trialled in 1914 with a <a href="superheater">superheater</a>. Most of Manson's later locomotives were subsequently fitted with superheaters, the eight-wheeled tenders being replaced in most cases with six-wheeled tenders during the rebuild.

In 1890 Manson was replaced as locomotive superintendent by <a href="James%20Johnson%20%28railway%20engineer%29">James Johnson</a>, the son of <a href="Samuel%20W.%20Johnson">Samuel W. Johnson</a>, then locomotive superintendent at the <a href="Midland%20Railway">Midland Railway</a>. In 1893 Neilsons delivered six new 4-4-0 tender locomotives that were more powerful any previous Great North locomotive and the first not to have Clark's smoke prevention apparatus. Classified as Class S and known for rapid acceleration and sustained high speed, these were the blueprint for the later Great North tender locomotives. Manson had left a design for a 0-4-4 tank locomotive and Johnson changed the firebox, boiler and value gear so they were the same as the Class S tender locomotives before ordering nine to work the Deeside Line. These arrived in 1893 and most were transferred to the Aberdeen suburban services in 1900.
<a href="William%20Pickersgill">William Pickersgill</a> replaced Johnson in 1894, and between 1895 and 1898 twenty-six new locomotives were purchased from Neilsons. Similar to Johnson's Class S, they were recorded at speeds of and running the from to in 23 minutes 46 seconds. A further order for ten was placed in 1899, but train mileage had been reduced and five were sold to the <a href="South%20Eastern%20%26amp%3B%20Chatham%20Railway">South Eastern & Chatham Railway</a>. Pickersgill saw the works move from Kittybrewster to Inverurie before <a href="Thomas%20Heywood">Thomas Heywood</a> took over in 1914, three months before the outbreak of war. The railway took over the working of the Aberdeen harbour railway and in 1915 purchased four 0-4-2 tank locomotives from <a href="Manning%20Wardle">Manning Wardle</a>. After the war, six more locomotives were built in 1920 by the <a href="North%20British%20Locomotive%20Company">North British Locomotive Company</a>, and two locomotives the following year at Inverurie. Similar to the 1899 locomotives but with Robinson superheaters, these were given names. Heywood changed the livery during the war, and the traditional green being replaced by black lined with yellow and red.

On 1 January 1923 the Great North of Scotland became a part of the Scottish division of the <a href="London%20and%20North%20Eastern%20Railway">London and North Eastern Railway</a> (LNER), who received a total of 122 locomotives, 100 4-4-0 tender locomotives and 22 tank engines, all capable of being used on either passenger or goods trains. Forty-four locomotives were still in service when the railway was nationalised in 1948, and the last two Great North locomotives to be withdrawn were two of the Aberdeen harbour tanks in 1960. No. 49, "Gordon Highlander" was restored to Great North green in 1958, although it had not previously carried the green livery as it appeared in Heywood's lined black. It was used on special trains before becoming a static exhibit at the <a href="Glasgow%20Transport%20Museum">Glasgow Transport Museum</a> in 1965, and is currently on loan to the <a href="Scottish%20Railway%20Museum">Scottish Railway Museum</a> at Bo'ness.

The first carriages were four-wheelers, long. Painted a dark brown with yellow lining and lettering, they had Newall's <a href="chain%20brake">chain brake</a> and a seat for the guard on the roof. Two classes of accommodation were provided: the first class carriages were divided into three compartments each with six upholstered seats and lit by two oil lamps hung between the partitions. Third class passengers were seated on wooden benches in a carriage seating 40 passengers sharing one oil lamp. The Great North never owned any second class carriages. Built by Brown, Marshall & Co, only half the number of carriages ordered had arrived for the start of public services in 1854. Later the guard's seat was removed and longer vehicles with six wheels were built. Accommodation for third class passengers was improved in the 1880s and the seats were upholstered.

The Westinghouse <a href="Railway%20air%20brake">air brake</a> was trialled on carriages in the 1880s and this became standard in 1891. As the <a href="Highland%20Railway">Highland Railway</a> used vacuum brakes, carriages used on the Aberdeen to Inverness were dual-fitted. The livery changed in the late 1890s, when the upper half was painted cream and the lower purple lake, with gold lining and lettering. Corridor carriages, long on six wheels, lit with electric lamps using Stone's system and with both classes having access to a lavatory appeared in 1896. Bogie corridor carriages, long and weighing were built for the Aberdeen to Inverness express in 1898 with provision for vestibule connections. The Great North also had Royal Saloon carriage that, unusually for the Great North, was built with a clerestory roof. This was long, lit by electric lamps and with steam heating, and divided into a first class compartment and an attendant's coupe, which was fitted with a cooking stove. Later, shorter six-wheeled and bogie compartment carriages were built for secondary services, and communication cords and steam heating were fitted in the early years of the twentieth century. No. 34, a 6-wheel carriage built in the 1890s is preserved at the <a href="Embsay%20%26amp%3B%20Bolton%20Abbey%20Steam%20Railway">Embsay & Bolton Abbey Steam Railway</a> as part of the Stately Trains collection.

In 1905 the Great North introduced two articulated <a href="steam%20railcar">steam railcar</a>s. The locomotive unit was mounted on four wheels, one pair driven and with the Cochran patent boiler that was common on stationary engines, but an unusual design for a locomotive. The saloon carriage accommodated 46 third class passengers on reversible lath-and-space seats and a position for the driver with controls using cables over the carriage roof. The cars were introduced on the Lossiemouth branch and the St Combs Light Railway, but when in motion there was considerable vibration that was uncomfortable for the passengers and caused problems for the steam engine. Before they were withdrawn in 1909–10, one was tried on Deeside suburban services, but had insufficient accommodation and was unable to maintain the schedule.

The Great North of Scotland Railway absorbed the following railways in 1866:


These companies operated by the Great North in 1866 were merged later:

Killer7

The game follows an elite group of assassins called the "killer7". The assassins, physical manifestations of a man named Harman Smith, perform <a href="contract%20killing">hits</a> on behalf of the United States government. Through these missions, the killer7 uncover a deeper conspiracy regarding the role of Japan in U.S. politics and secrets about the nature of their organization. "Killer7" features <a href="first-person%20shooter">first-person shooter</a> elements and a unique <a href="Rail%20shooter">on rails</a> control scheme, but the core adventure-style gameplay has been compared to "<a href="Myst">Myst</a>" and "<a href="Snatcher%20%28video%20game%29">Snatcher</a>".

"Killer7" was Suda51's first game released outside Japan. It received polarized reviews due to its unconventional control scheme, linear gameplay, and complex <a href="film%20noir">noir</a> plot. While some reviewers appreciated the stripped-down controls and stylized <a href="arthouse">arthouse</a> approach, others panned it as confusing and restricting. However, the game's soundtrack, presentation, visual style and thought-provoking story received generally positive responses from critics and considered as the best aspects of the game and lead to several accolades and nominations. "Killer7"s <a href="cult%20following">cult appeal</a> led to remakes of Suda51's older works, a remastered version of "Killer7" for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> released in 2018, and the successful launch of "<a href="No%20More%20Heroes%20%28video%20game%29">No More Heroes</a>".

The player controls the <a href="player%20character">on-screen character</a>, a member of the killer7 group, from a third-person view using the <a href="gamepad">gamepad</a>. The gameplay consists of elements of <a href="first-person%20shooter">first-person shooter</a> and <a href="action-adventure%20game">action-adventure game</a> with <a href="Shoot%20%27em%20up%23Tube%20and%20rail%20shooters">restricted movement</a> (i.e. "on rails")—rather than allow free motion, the game limits the on-screen character to predetermined paths through the environment. The on-screen character moves forward by holding a button and reverses direction with another button press. At intersections, the player may choose which path to take. Progress is made by navigating the environment and solving puzzles. Some puzzles require the talents of a specific killer7 member. The player may switch between available members via a menu in the pause screen at any time; not all personalities may be awake at a start of a mission, and requires defeating a number of enemies before they can be awakened. Other puzzles require magical rings or other items collected throughout the game.

Combat in "Killer7" occurs when the player encounters enemies called "Heaven Smiles". Smiles announce their presence with a laughing sound effect and are initially invisible. The player must switch to a first-person viewpoint and scan the surroundings to reveal Smiles. While in first-person view, movement is disabled and the <a href="analog%20stick">analog stick</a> aims the character's gun. Targeting specific body parts will disable them; for example, shooting off a leg will cause a Smile to fall to the ground and crawl toward the player. The player may aim for a "critical point" that instantly destroys the Smile. Smiles that get too close will explode and injure the character. If a character dies, players can use Garcian Smith to retrieve the fallen character's head and bring them back to life; if Garcian dies, then the game ends.

Defeated Smiles yield "thick blood" and "thin blood". Thick blood functions similarly to <a href="experience%20point">experience point</a>s, and players gain more by shooting Smiles' critical points. The player may redeem thick blood for "serum" while in "Harman's Room", <a href="Saved%20game%23Checkpoints">checkpoints</a> that appear throughout the game. Serum is used to improve the <a href="Attribute%20%28role-playing%20games%29">attributes</a> of the characters such as "power" and "speed". This also unlocks special abilities for the characters. Players may <a href="saved%20game">save</a> their game in designated Harman's Rooms. Thin blood is used to recover the characters' <a href="health%20%28gaming%29">stamina</a> and fuel special abilities.

Completing the game unlocks a new difficulty called Killer8 where the character Young Harman can be played along with the original seven personalities. Killer8 is more difficult than the original mode with most enemies able to kill the player with one attack. Completing Killer8 unlocks a comical Hopper7 mode where the first level can be replayed with weaker enemies that wear grasshopper masks, mirroring the logo for the game's developer Grasshopper Manufacture.

"Killer7" takes place in an alternate version of Earth in the early 21st century. After a treaty ends all international conflict, the <a href="great%20power">world powers</a> <a href="nuclear%20disarmament">destroy all nuclear weapons</a> by firing them into the upper atmosphere and intercepting them with other missiles. This event becomes known as "Fireworks" and symbolizes world peace to the general populace. In an effort to combat <a href="terrorism">terrorism</a>, <a href="pandemic">pandemic</a> disease, and <a href="cyberterrorism">cyberterrorism</a>, the International Ethics Committee (IEC) shuts down all <a href="air%20travel">air travel</a> and public use of the <a href="Internet">Internet</a>. Air transportation is replaced by a system of intercontinental <a href="Controlled-access%20highway">expressways</a>. However, a new terrorist group called "Heaven Smile" appears, targeting the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> (UN) and IEC. The members of Heaven Smile are humans who have been infected with a virus that evokes a desire to kill. Factory-produced Smiles are given a "bomb-organ" that allows them to <a href="suicide%20attack">explode at will</a>, their principal means of attack.

In this Earth, <a href="politics%20of%20Japan">Japanese politics</a> are dominated by two parties: the UN Party and the Liberal Party. The UN Party is more powerful and moves to end the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Mutual%20Cooperation%20and%20Security%20between%20the%20United%20States%20and%20Japan">Asian Security Treaty</a> and sever ties with the United States (US). The UN Party seized control of the Japanese government through the wisdom of the "Yakumo Cabinet Policy", a secret document which details how to run the "ideal nation". It was written by the Union 7, young members of the Liberal Party who went on to found the UN Party. The US government is also eager to sever relations with Japan, seeing the country as a hindrance and of little economic value. The interaction between Japan and the US is a central source of conflict in "Killer7".

The player controls the members of a group of assassins called the "killer7". The group is led by an elderly man in a wheelchair named Harman Smith, who exhibits "Multifoliate Personae Phenomenon". This condition allows him to physically transform into one of his seven assassin personae: <a href="African%20American">African American</a> Garcian Smith, aggressive <a href="Irish%20American">Irish American</a> Dan Smith, <a href="Japanese%20American">Japanese American</a> female Kaede Smith, <a href="White%20British">White British</a> <a href="albino">albino</a> Kevin Smith, <a href="Puerto%20Rican%20people">Mestizo Puerto Rican</a> Coyote Smith, young <a href="Chinese%20American">Chinese American</a> Con Smith, and <a href="Mexican%20American">Mexican American</a> <a href="lucha%20libre">luchador</a> Mask de Smith. These people were gifted killers in life and Harman absorbed their souls through his condition after their deaths. The killer7 were temporarily incapacitated in an incident 50 years ago, in which the members of the group were systematically tracked and killed while performing a job at the Union Hotel in Pennsylvania. Garcian, whose power is to revive fallen personae, became the dominant personality as a result. In this capacity, he receives orders from the frail Harman when his consciousness is "awake" and accepts jobs from Christopher Mills, who hires the killer7 on behalf of the US government. Multifoliate Personae Phenomenon also causes Harman and his personae to see "remnant psyches"—ghosts of their past victims. Iwazaru, a man in a <a href="bondage%20suit">bondage suit</a>, and Travis Bell, the killer7's first target, are the main remnant psyches who aid them throughout the game. The primary antagonist is an old friend of Harman's named Kun Lan. He has the "Hand of God", a supernatural power that produces the Heaven Smile virus.

The game opens with a conversation between Garcian Smith and Christopher Mills about a new job for the killer7. The assassins battle their way to the top of a building which has become infested with Heaven Smiles. Harman confronts the source of the Smiles, an angel-like figure, but she is merely Kun Lan's puppet. Harman and Kun Lan discuss the current state of the world before the mission ends. In the subsequent missions, the killer7 target a number of individuals on behalf of the US government or for personal reasons. They kill Andrei Ulmeyda, a Texan postal worker who established a successful company based on the Yakumo, when he becomes infected with the Heaven Smile virus. Dan Smith confronts Curtis Blackburn, his former mentor and murderer, when Mills informs the group that Blackburn is running an <a href="organ%20trade%23Illegal%20organ%20trade">organ trafficking</a> business that targets young girls. Their penultimate mission pits them against the "Handsome Men", a group of <a href="sentai">sentai</a> rangers who assassinate a US politician.

The central plot arc concerns the true nature of <a href="Japan%20%E2%80%93%20United%20States%20relations">US–Japan relations</a>. After a volley of two hundred <a href="intercontinental%20ballistic%20missile">intercontinental ballistic missile</a>s are fired at Japan, the US government contracts the killer7 to eliminate Toru Fukushima, the head of the UN Party. However, an assassin posing as Fukushima's secretary kills him first in an attempt to reclaim the Yakumo document for the Liberal Party, believing its wisdom would help the party to regain political power. Shortly thereafter, Kenjiro Matsuoka (nicknamed "Matsuken") kills two senior members of the UN Party to become its new leader, under the influence of Kun Lan. In the end, the killer7 defeat the two UN Party members who had been reanimated by Kun Lan as Japan is destroyed by the missiles.

In their final mission, the killer7 seek Matsuken, who leads the 10 million UN Party members who live in the US. The government fears that if they converge on a single state, they could win a seat in the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a>. Garcian travels to Coburn Elementary School near <a href="Seattle">Seattle, Washington</a> and discovers tapes that reveal the school as a front for the UN Party to train children as assassins. The tapes focus on Emir Parkreiner, a gifted killer trained at the school. Garcian learns that Japan uses Coburn to control the vote of the US presidential election. The assassins battle a group of invincible Smiles and all but Garcian are incapacitated. Garcian travels to the Union Hotel where he witnesses visions of the other members being killed in their rooms. At the top, he discovers that his true identity is Emir Parkreiner, the one who killed the killer7 at the Union Hotel over 50 years ago. Following that incident, Harman absorbed Emir as a persona and Emir's memories were lost.

Three years later, Garcian arrives at <a href="Hashima%20Island">Battleship Island</a> in Japan to destroy the last Heaven Smile. He meets with Matsuken, who presents Garcian with a choice: let him live, which allows Japan to mount an assault on the US; or kill him, which lets the US discover Japan's role in rigging American elections—US forces destroy Japan's last stronghold, Battleship Island, in retaliation and wipe Japan off the map. Regardless of the player's choice, Garcian finds that the last Heaven Smile is Iwazaru, whose real identity is Kun Lan, and kills him. However, Harman and Kun Lan are revealed to be immortal beings, representing a dialectic struggle between opposites, which persists a century in the future in <a href="Shanghai">Shanghai</a> as they continue their eternal battle.

Development for "Killer7" began in mid-2002 as part of the <a href="Capcom%20Five">Capcom Five</a>, a set of games overseen by <a href="Shinji%20Mikami">Shinji Mikami</a> and intended to be exclusive to the <a href="GameCube">GameCube</a>. Capcom produced the games to bring new <a href="intellectual%20property">intellectual property</a> to the video game industry, which the company viewed as stagnant. "Killer7"s gameplay mechanics were finalized late in development because most resources went to story and visual work. Director <a href="Goichi%20Suda">Suda51</a> wrote the scenario based on a plot he conceived together with Mikami, and later decided on the unconventional control scheme as a <a href="deconstruction">deconstruction</a> of how gamers play and to "create new expression". Complex controls and <a href="Combo%20%28video%20gaming%29">combos</a> were omitted to present a system that fosters easy progression for the player. Producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi described the controls as "intuitive" and stated that the team wanted players to "think when they are playing" so they can enjoy the mystery in the story. The long development process culminated in several delays, the last of which was due to an artistic desire to release the game on July 7 (7/7).

Suda51 drew influence from <a href="film%20noir">film noir</a>, particularly the theme of <a href="dissociative%20identity%20disorder">multiple personality disorder</a>, and called "Killer7" a "<a href="hardboiled">hardboiled</a> <a href="action-adventure%20game">action-adventure</a>". Hiro Sugiyama, <a href="Peter%20Saville%20%28designer%29">Peter Saville</a>, and American <a href="comic%20book">comic book</a> artists, such as <a href="Adrian%20Tomine">Adrian Tomine</a>, inspired the artistic design and aesthetic. Suda51 noted the inclusion of <a href="traditional%20animation">cel animation</a> in <a href="Modern%20animation%20in%20the%20United%20States">Western</a> and Japanese <a href="anime">anime</a> styles was meant to legitimize <a href="video%20games%20as%20an%20art%20form">video games as an art form</a> by competing with traditional art forms in their stage. The game's anime sequences were created by <a href="Xebec%20%28studio%29">Xebec</a>, while the CGI sequences were handled by <a href="Digital%20Frontier">Digital Frontier</a>. Kobayashi commented that "Killer7" is "styled more as an interactive story than a traditional game." Suda also drew from <a href="yakuza%20film">yakuza film</a> "". His experience as an <a href="funeral%20director">undertaker</a> had a powerful effect on the portrayal of death in his games. The game reflects his interest in <a href="professional%20wrestling">professional wrestling</a>; Suda51 included a luchador character, Mask de Smith, and conducted interviews and attended promotional events while wearing a <a href="lucha%20libre">lucha libre</a> mask. Reflecting on his work, Suda51 considers "Killer7" his proudest achievement.

"Killer7" received divisive reviews and sparked debates about depictions of <a href="video%20game%20controversy">sex and violence in video games</a> and the status of video games as art. James Mielke of <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a> likened the game's high-contrast art style to noir and <a href="neo-noir">neo-noir</a> film such as "<a href="Seven%20%281995%20film%29">Se7en</a>". He found that despite poor pacing and stilted gameplay, the "quirky scripting and edgy plot" were strong draws, and called "Killer7" one of the "most artfully designed footnotes in gaming history". "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" magazine's reviewers echoed this sentiment and predicted that the game would "[pave the way] for future creative leeway", crediting the director with an unwavering artistic vision. <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>'s Kristan Reed was keenly aware of the game's limited appeal, calling it "a concept game, an arthouse game, a simple game, an often beautiful game, but most certainly never an everyman's game". <a href="Ben%20Croshaw">Yahtzee Croshaw</a> of "<a href="The%20Escapist%20%28magazine%29">The Escapist</a>" commends the game for "showing exactly what can be done when you flaunt all established convention and just start exploring what can really be done with gaming as an art form".

Virtually all aspects of the game had their proponents and detractors. Greg Kasavin of <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> praised the unity of "great-looking camera work with simple controls" and compared its "thought-provoking" storyline to "<a href="Metal%20Gear%20Solid">Metal Gear Solid</a>", while a "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" reviewer criticized those features, calling the controls limited, the <a href="Cel-shaded%20animation">cel-shading</a> dull, and the story incoherent. Kasavin complimented the game's eclectic soundtrack, excellent voice acting, and distinctive sound effects, while the "GamePro" reviewer panned them as minimalist and irritating. <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Matt Casamassina likened the control scheme to "old-school adventure games like "<a href="Myst">Myst</a>" and "<a href="Snatcher%20%28video%20game%29">Snatcher</a>"" and commended Suda51 for making a "cult hit", "erupting with style, mood and undiluted craziness". Casamassina was also impressed by the quality of the anime-style <a href="cutscene">cutscene</a>s featured in the latter half of the game.

The IGN, GameSpot, and <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a> reviews noted the GameCube version features superior graphics, substantially faster loading times, and more responsive controls than the PlayStation 2 version, resulting in lower scores for the latter. Nevertheless, IGN called it the 94th best PlayStation 2 game. "<a href="Nintendo%20Power">Nintendo Power</a>" claimed that "Killer7" is a "highly rewarding" experience for dedicated gamers. <a href="Nintendo%20World%20Report">Nintendo World Report</a> writer Karl Castaneda also remarked that, despite repetitive gameplay, it was ""still" fun". Charles Herold of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" was less forgiving and commented that the lack of new features beyond the first hour made the remaining experience boring and annoying.

Despite its mixed reception, a number of <a href="video%20game%20journalism">video game publications</a> recognized "Killer7"s unconventional gameplay and innovative style. At GameSpot's "Best and Worst of 2005" awards, the game was nominated for Best Story, Best GameCube Game, Most Outrageous Game, Most Gratuitous Use of F------ Swearing, and won Best New Character (Harman Smith) and Most Innovative Game. IGN similarly nominated it for Game of the Year, Most Innovative Design, and Best Artistic Design and awarded it Best Adventure Game, Best Story, and Best Game No One Played. IGN later named "Killer7" the 20th best GameCube game of all time. The game had a large presence at the 2005 "Nintendo Power" Awards, winning Best New Character (Harman Smith).

In August 2005, <a href="Jack%20Thompson%20%28activist%29">Jack Thompson</a>, an activist who campaigns against video games, demanded that the <a href="Entertainment%20Software%20Rating%20Board">Entertainment Software Rating Board</a> (ESRB) change its rating for "Killer7" from "M" (for Mature, ages 17 and up) to "AO" (for Adults Only, ages 18 and up). He cited Casamassina's review of the game at IGN, claiming that "full-blown sex sequences" present in the game would be harmful to minors. Casamassina rebutted that the scene in question involved two fully clothed adults and that a similar scene in a film would garner "only a PG-13 or, worst, R-rating".

Reviewers quickly identified "Killer7" as a <a href="cult%20following">cult game</a> with limited appeal. IGN lamented that its experimental style was not conducive to high sales, naming it GameCube's Best Game No One Played in their 2005 awards. IGN's Casamassina later placed it fourth in his "Top 10 Tuesday: Underrated and Underappreciated Games" feature. Despite modest sales, "Killer7"s cult success prompted the development of remakes of Suda51's older Japan-only games, "<a href="The%20Silver%20Case">The Silver Case</a>" and "<a href="Flower%2C%20Sun%2C%20and%20Rain">Flower, Sun, and Rain</a>". In 2007, <a href="Grasshopper%20Manufacture">Grasshopper Manufacture</a> released Suda51's "<a href="No%20More%20Heroes%20%28video%20game%29">No More Heroes</a>" to critical and commercial success. In addition to an <a href="soundtrack">original soundtrack</a> and <a href="comic%20book">comic book</a> adaptation, Capcom published "Hand in killer7", a companion book that explains the plot in more depth. Kinetic Underground, the company that handled the comic book, also released a number of <a href="figurine">figurine</a>s depicting characters from the game.

"Killer7 Original Sound Track" was released on June 20, 2005 by <a href="Sony%20Music%20Entertainment">Sony Music Entertainment</a>. It features 55 compositions by <a href="Masafumi%20Takada">Masafumi Takada</a> and 6 by Jun Fukuda across two discs. Takada put a large emphasis on <a href="ambient%20music">ambient music</a> due to the genre's ability to draw in the player. He called his soundtrack a "translation of the text" of the game and sought to retell the story through music. Carolyn Gudmundson of <a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a> praised the soundtrack's varied style, a "moody, atmosphereric base punctuated with spikes of manic energy". She singled out "Rave On", a track heard before mini-boss battles, as an excellent example of the latter. GameSpy's Phil Theobald had similar compliments for "Rave On" and other more subdued pieces that slowly "work [their] way into your mind".

Takada said in a 2008 interview that "Killer7" is his favourite own soundtrack.

Track list

In 2006, <a href="Devil%27s%20Due%20Publishing">Devil's Due Publishing</a> released a comic book adaptation of "Killer7", written and drawn by Kinetic Underground staff. The planned 12-issue <a href="Limited%20series%20%28comics%29">limited series</a> was cancelled after four issues. Players who preordered "Killer7" through <a href="EB%20Games">EB Games</a> received a special "Issue #0" as a bonus, and "Issue #½" was available at the 2005 <a href="San%20Diego%20Comic-Con%20International">San Diego Comic-Con</a>. Writer Arvid Nelson described the story as a "mutant cross-breeding of <a href="John%20Woo">John Woo</a> and <a href="Quentin%20Tarantino">Quentin Tarantino</a>", and Devil's Due President Josh Blaylock commented that "Killer7"s style was perfect for the comic book medium. In adapting the game, Nelson admitted that the plot was streamlined to maintain a comprehensible story, but noted that the "video game doesn't <a href="spoon-feed">spoon-feed</a> you information ... That's how the comic's going to be, too".

Since its inception, fans have been anticipating a "Killer7" sequel. Suda made it clear that it will "probably never happen" as Capcom holds the rights to the IP. In a 2010 interview, he exclaimed that "Killer7" is "part of his soul" and is certainly interested in making a sequel.

In 2012, Suda revealed a new game titled "<a href="Killer%20Is%20Dead">Killer Is Dead</a>"; word quickly spread that it was a follow-up to "Killer7" since the game shares similar concept with an assassin protagonist, complex plot and cel-shaded graphics. Suda later clarified that "Killer Is Dead" is an original game and has no relation to "Killer7".

During a panel at 2016's PAX East, Suda expressed his interest to remaster "Killer7" and has begun talks with the game's publisher, Capcom. On March 17 2018, during "HOPPER'S Vol. 5" an event celebrating Grasshopper Manufacture's 20th anniversary, Suda verbally announced to attendees that there are plans to remaster both "Killer7" and "Flower, Sun, and Rain." However no platform or release date was mentioned. Suda later posted on his <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> account stating that the "Killer7" remaster will be out within 10 years. At the 2018 <a href="MomoCon">MomoCon</a>, Suda announced that a remastered version of "Killer7" for Microsoft Windows which was released on November 15, 2018.

Imogen Holst

Imogen Clare Holst (; 12 April 1907 – 9 March 1984) was a British composer, arranger, conductor, teacher, musicologist, and festival administrator. The only child of the composer <a href="Gustav%20Holst">Gustav Holst</a>, she is particularly known for her educational work at <a href="Dartington%20Hall">Dartington Hall</a> in the 1940s, and for her 20 years as joint artistic director of the <a href="Aldeburgh%20Festival">Aldeburgh Festival</a>. In addition to composing music, she wrote composer biographies, much educational material, and several books on the life and works of her father.

From a young age, Holst showed precocious talent in composing and performance. After attending <a href="Eothen%20School">Eothen School</a> and <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Girls%27%20School">St Paul's Girls' School</a>, she entered the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Music">Royal College of Music</a>, where she developed her skills as a conductor and won several prizes for composing. Unable for health reasons to follow her initial ambitions to be a pianist or a dancer, Holst spent most of the 1930s teaching, and as a full-time organiser for the <a href="English%20Folk%20Dance%20and%20Song%20Society">English Folk Dance and Song Society</a>. These duties reduced her compositional activities, although she made many arrangements of folksongs. After serving as an organiser for the <a href="Arts%20Council%20of%20Great%20Britain">Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts</a> at the start of the Second World War, in 1942 she began working at Dartington. In her nine years there she established Dartington as a major centre of music education and activity.

In the early 1950s Holst became <a href="Benjamin%20Britten">Benjamin Britten</a>'s musical assistant, moved to Aldeburgh, and began helping with the organisation of the annual Aldeburgh Festival. In 1956 she became joint artistic director of the festival, and during the following 20 years helped it to a position of pre-eminence in British musical life. In 1964 she gave up her work as Britten's assistant, to resume her own compositional career and to concentrate on the preservation of her father's musical legacy. Her own music is not widely known and has received little critical attention; much of it is unpublished and unperformed. The first recordings dedicated to her works, issued in 2009 and 2012, were warmly received by critics. She was appointed CBE in 1975 and received numerous academic honours. She died at Aldeburgh and is buried in the churchyard there.

Imogen Holst was born on 12 April 1907 at 31 Grena Road, <a href="Richmond%2C%20London">Richmond</a>, a riverside town to the west of London. Her parents were <a href="Gustav%20Holst">Gustav Theodore Holst</a>, an aspiring composer then working as a music teacher, and Isobel, "née" Harrison. The Holst family, of mixed Swedish, German and Latvian ancestry, had been in England since 1802 and had been musicians for several generations. Gustav followed this family tradition; while studying at the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Music">Royal College of Music</a> (RCM), he met Isobel Harrison, who sang in one of the amateur choirs that he conducted. He was immediately attracted to her, and they were married on 22 July 1901.

While attempting to establish himself as a composer, Gustav Holst worked first as an orchestral trombonist, and later as a teacher. In 1907 he held teaching posts at <a href="James%20Allen%27s%20Girls%27%20School">James Allen's Girls' School</a> in <a href="Dulwich">Dulwich</a>, and <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Girls%27%20School">St Paul's Girls' School</a> (SPGS) in <a href="Hammersmith">Hammersmith</a>, where he was director of music. From 1907 he acted as director of music at <a href="Morley%20College">Morley College</a>, an adult education centre in the <a href="Waterloo%2C%20London">Waterloo</a> district of London. When Imogen was still very small the family moved from Richmond to a small house by the river in nearby <a href="Barnes%2C%20London">Barnes</a>, which they rented from a relative. Imogen's main memories of this house were of her father working in his composing room on the top floor, which she was forbidden to visit, and of his efforts to teach her folk-songs.

Descriptions of Imogen as a small child indicate that she had blue eyes, fair hair, an oval face reminiscent of her father's, and a rather prominent nose inherited from her mother. In 1912, at the age of five, she joined the kindergarten class at the <a href="Froebel%20College">Froebel Institute</a>, and remained at the school for five years. Summers were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at <a href="Thaxted">Thaxted</a> in <a href="Essex">Essex</a>, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.

In 1917 Imogen began boarding at <a href="Eothen%20School">Eothen</a>, a small, private school for girls in <a href="Caterham">Caterham</a>, where <a href="Jane%20Joseph">Jane Joseph</a>, Gustav's star pupil from SPGS, taught music. A letter home, dated 17 July 1917, tells of "compertishions, and ripping prizes, and strawberries and cream for tea". At the school, Imogen studied piano with Eleanor Shuttleworth, violin with André Mangeot (described as "topping") and theory with Jane Joseph ("ripping"). Under Joseph's tuition Imogen produced her first compositions—two instrumental pieces and four Christmas carol tunes—which she numbered as Ops. 1, 2, and 3. In the summer term of 1920, she composed and choreographed a "Dance of the Nymphs and Shepherds", which was performed at the school under her direction on 9 July.

Imogen left Eothen in December 1920 hoping to study under Ruby Ginner at the Ginner-Mawer School of Dance and Drama, but was rejected on health grounds, although there appeared to be no significant medical issue. She then studied at home under a governess, while waiting to start at St Paul's Girls School in the autumn. At Whitsun 1921 she took part as a dancer in her father's production of <a href="Henry%20Purcell">Purcell</a>'s <a href="semi-opera">semi-opera</a> from 1690, "<a href="Dioclesian">Masque of Dioclesian</a>", held in the St Paul's School grounds and repeated a week later in <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20London">Hyde Park</a>.

In September 1921 Imogen began at St Paul's Girls School, and became a boarder from Spring 1922. In July 1922 she performed a Bach Prelude and Fugue on the piano, for which Joseph praised her warmly, writing: "I think everyone enjoyed the Bach from beginning to end, they all made nice contented noises at the end of it". Imogen's SPGS years were generally happy and successful. In July 1923 she won the junior Alice Lupton piano prize, but her chances of distinction as a pianist were marred when she began to develop <a href="phlebitis">phlebitis</a> in her left arm. Among other activities she became interested in folk music and dance, and in 1923 became a member of the <a href="English%20Folk%20Dance%20and%20Song%20Society">English Folk Dance Society</a> (EFDS). In 1924–25, her final year at SPGS, Imogen founded a folk dance society in the school. At an end-of-term school concert late in July 1925, she played <a href="%C3%89tude%20Op.%2010%2C%20No.%203%20%28Chopin%29">Chopin's étude in E major</a> and gave the first performance of Gustav Holst's "Toccata".

Although destined like her father for the RCM, Holst first spent a year studying composition with <a href="Herbert%20Howells">Herbert Howells</a>, piano with Adine O'Neill and the French horn with Adolph Borsdorf, while participating in the EFDS summer schools and other musical activities. In July 1926 she arranged and conducted the music for an EFDS pageant, held at Thaxted as a fund-raiser towards the building of the society's new headquarters at <a href="Regent%27s%20Park">Regent's Park</a>. Holst began at the RCM in September 1926, studying piano with <a href="Kathleen%20Long">Kathleen Long</a>, composition with <a href="George%20Dyson%20%28composer%29">George Dyson</a>, and conducting under <a href="William%20Henry%20Reed">W. H. Reed</a>. Her aptitude as a conductor was evident in December 1926, when she led the college's Third Orchestra in the opening movement of <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a>'s <a href="Symphony%20No.%2038%20%28Mozart%29">"Prague" Symphony</a>. This and other performances on the podium led "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" to speculate that Holst might eventually become the first woman to "establish a secure tenure of the conductor's platform".

In her second RCM year Holst concentrated on composition, producing several chamber works including a violin sonata, an oboe quintet, and a suite for woodwind. She took her first steps towards personal independence when she moved from the family home to a <a href="bedsit">bedsit</a> near <a href="Kensington%20Gardens">Kensington Gardens</a>. In 1928 she went to Belgium with the EFDS, took an Italian holiday, and made an extended trip to Germany with a group known as "The Travelling Morrice" which promoted international understanding through music and dance. In October 1928 she won the RCM's Cobbett prize for an original chamber composition, her "Phantasy" String Quartet, and shortly afterwards was awarded the Morley Scholarship for the "best all-round student". The quartet was broadcast by the BBC on 20 March 1929, but for her, the achievement was overshadowed by the news that month of the premature death at 34 of her early mentor Jane Joseph.

In the winter of 1929 Holst made her first visit to Canada and the United States, as part of an EFDS party. Back home, she worked on her RCM finals composition, a suite for brass band entitled "The Unfortunate Traveller". Despite some apprehension on her part, the piece passed the examiners' scrutiny and was played at the college's end-of-year concert in July 1930. Before then, in June, Holst learned that she had been awarded an Octavia Travelling Scholarship worth £100, which would enable her to study composition abroad.

Holst spent much of the period between September 1930 and May 1931 travelling. A hectic visit to <a href="Li%C3%A8ge">Liège</a> in September, for the International Society of Contemporary Music Congress, was followed immediately by a three-month round trip, to Scandinavia, Germany, Austria and Hungary, returning to England via Prague, Dresden, Leipzig, Berlin and Amsterdam. Her musical experiences included a Mozart pilgrimage in Salzburg, performances of "<a href="Der%20Rosenkavalier">Der Rosenkavalier</a>" and "<a href="Die%20Entf%C3%BChrung%20aus%20dem%20Serail">Die Entführung aus dem Serail</a>" at the <a href="Vienna%20State%20Opera">Vienna State Opera</a>, Bach in Berlin and <a href="Symphony%20No.%207%20%28Mahler%29">Mahler's Seventh Symphony</a> in Amsterdam. On 1 February 1932 she left England again, this time for Italy. After a two-month tour Holst came home with mixed views on Italian music-making. She concluded that "the Italians are a nation of singers ... But music is a different language in that part of the world". Back in London, she decided that despite her experiences, "if it is music one is wanting, there is no place like London."

With her scholarship funds exhausted, Holst needed a job, and in June 1931 took charge of music at the Citizen House arts and education centre in <a href="Bath%20%28Somerset%29">Bath</a>. She disliked the disciplines imposed by an unsympathetic and unyielding superior, but stayed until the end of the year, by which time Citizen House had relocated to <a href="Hampstead">Hampstead</a>. She worked briefly as a freelance conductor and accompanist before joining the staff of the EFDS early in 1932. The organisation had by now expanded to become the "English Folk Dance and Song Society" (EFDSS) and was based in new headquarters at Cecil Sharp House. The duties, mainly teaching, were not full-time, and she was able to take up part-time teaching posts at her old school, Eothen, and at <a href="Roedean%20School">Roedean School</a>. Although she composed little original music during these years, she made many instrumental and vocal arrangements of traditional folk melodies.

Gustav Holst's health had been poor for years; in the winter of 1933–34 it deteriorated, and he died on 25 May 1934. Imogen Holst privately determined that she would establish and protect her father's musical legacy. On 24 March 1935 she took part in a Gustav Holst memorial concert, in which she conducted her own arrangement of one of her father's brass band suites. Meanwhile, her own music was beginning to attract attention. Her carol arrangement "Nowell and Nowell" was performed in a 1934 Christmas concert in <a href="Chichester%20Cathedral">Chichester Cathedral</a>, and the following year saw the premiere of her Concerto for Violin and Strings, with Elsie Avril as the soloist. In 1936 she paid a visit to <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>, where she stayed with her uncle (Gustav's brother), the actor <a href="Ernest%20Cossart">Ernest Cossart</a>. Back in England, Holst worked on recorder arrangements of music by the neglected 16th-century composer <a href="Pelham%20Humphrey">Pelham Humphrey</a>. These were published in 1936 to a positive critical reception.

In 1938 Holst published a biography of her father. Among many positive comments from friends and critics, the composer <a href="Edmund%20Rubbra">Edmund Rubbra</a> praised her for producing a book that was not "clouded by sentiment ... her biography is at once intimate and objective".

In 1938 Holst decided to abandon amateur music-making and teaching to concentrate on her own professional development. She resigned her EFDSS post while continuing to honour existing commitments to the organisation. She had given up her work at Roedean in 1936; at Easter 1939 she resigned from Eothen. In June 1939 she began a tour of Switzerland which included the <a href="Lucerne%20Festival">Lucerne Festival</a>. Towards the end of August, as war became increasingly likely, she broke off the trip and returned home.

After the outbreak of war on 3 September 1939, Holst worked for the Bloomsbury House Refugee Committee, which supported German and Austrian refugee musicians interned under emergency regulations. In January 1940 she accepted a position under a scheme organised by the <a href="Pilgrim%20Trust">Pilgrim Trust</a>, to act as one of six "music travellers", whose brief was to boost morale by encouraging musical activities in rural communities. Holst was assigned to cover the west of England, a huge area stretching from <a href="Oxfordshire">Oxfordshire</a> to <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>. When the government set up the <a href="Arts%20Council%20of%20Great%20Britain">Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts</a> (CEMA), responsibility for the music travellers passed to that body.

With little practical support from CEMA, Holst's organisational talents, according to her friend <a href="Ursula%20Vaughan%20Williams">Ursula Vaughan Williams</a>, "developed brilliantly". According to Holst's own account, her duties included conducting local brass bands and <a href="Women%27s%20Institute">Women's Institute</a> choirs ("fourteen very old women in hats sitting round the edge of a dark, empty hideous tin hut"), and organising sing-songs for evacuee children. She arranged performances by professional groups, and what she termed "drop-in-and-sing" festivals in which anyone could join. She wrote of "idyllic days" spent over cups of tea, discussing the hopes and dreams of would-be music makers. Her compositional activity in these years was limited by time and pressures of work, but she produced two recorder trios—the "Offley" and "Deddington" suites—and made numerous arrangements for female voices of carols and traditional songs.

In 1938, Holst had visited <a href="Dartington%20Hall">Dartington Hall</a>, a progressive school and crafts community near <a href="Totnes">Totnes</a> in <a href="Devon">Devon</a>, which had been founded in 1925 by <a href="Leonard%20Elmhirst">Leonard</a> and <a href="Dorothy%20Elmhirst">Dorothy Elmhirst</a>. In 1941–42, while travelling for CEMA in Devon and Cornwall, she was invited by the Elmhirsts to make her base at Dartington. In the summer of 1942 she was persuaded by Christopher Martin, the centre's administrator, to resign her CEMA role and work at Dartington. He had in mind a music course, "the sort of thing that your father did in the old days at Morley College". Beginning in 1943, Holst established a one-year course, initially designed to train young women to organise amateur orchestras and musical events in rural communities. Gradually it developed into a more general musical education for a broader student intake. Under Holst's leadership the course quickly became the hub of a range of musical activities, including the foundation of an amateur orchestra: "Hardly any of us could play ... However bad we were, we went on". Holst's teaching methods, heavily based on "learning by doing" and without formal examinations, at first disconcerted her students and puzzled the school inspectors, but eventually gained acceptance and respect. Rosamond Strode, a pupil at Dartington who later worked with Holst at Aldeburgh, said of her approach: "She knew exactly how, and when, to push her victims in at the deep end, and she knew, also, that although they would flounder and splash about at first, it wouldn't be long before ... they would be swimming easily while she beamed approval from the bank".

In the conducive atmosphere of Dartington Holst resumed serious composition, largely abandoned during the hectic CEMA years. In 1943 she completed a "Serenade" for flute, viola and bassoon, a "Suite for String Orchestra", and a choral work, "Three Psalms". All these works were performed at a <a href="Wigmore%20Hall">Wigmore Hall</a> concert on 14 June 1943 devoted to her music. Other compositions from the Dartington years included "Theme and Variations" for solo violin, String Trio No. 1 (premiered by the Dartington Hall String Trio at the <a href="National%20Gallery">National Gallery</a> on 17 July 1944), songs from the 16th-century anthology <a href="Tottel%27s%20Miscellany">Tottel's Miscellany</a>, an oboe concerto, and a string quartet. In October 1943 the composer <a href="Benjamin%20Britten">Benjamin Britten</a> and the tenor <a href="Peter%20Pears">Peter Pears</a> gave the first of several recitals at Dartington. A mutual respect and friendship developed between Britten and Holst, strengthened by their shared love of neglected music from the <a href="Renaissance%20music">Renaissance</a> and <a href="Baroque%20music">Baroque</a> eras. Holst was convinced that Britten was the composer to continue and complete the work of her father in redefining the character of English music.

From 1945, while maintaining her commitment to Dartington, Holst began to widen her musical activities. As well as editing and preparing scores for Britten, she promoted Dartington as the base for Britten's new <a href="English%20Opera%20Group">English Opera Group</a>, although eventually <a href="Glyndebourne">Glyndebourne</a> was preferred. In 1947 she encouraged the refugee violinist <a href="Norbert%20Brainin">Norbert Brainin</a> to form his own string quartet, and arranged its debut at Dartington, as the "Brainin Quartet", on 13 July 1947. Six months later, renamed the <a href="Amadeus%20Quartet">Amadeus Quartet</a>, the group appeared at the Wigmore Hall, and went on to worldwide recognition. In 1948 she began work on a critical study of her father's music, a companion volume to her 1938 Gustav Holst biography. When this was published in 1951, most critics praised its objectivity, one critic venturing that she had been "unnecessarily harsh" in her judgements.

Rising standards of achievement at Dartington enabled Holst to organise performances of more demanding works, such as Bach's <a href="Mass%20in%20B%20minor">Mass in B minor</a> in July 1950 to honour the 200th anniversary of Bach's death. Three years in preparation, this endeavour brought a tribute from one of the audience: "I don't know, and can't imagine what the music of heaven is like. But when we all get there, please God, if any conducting is still necessary I hope your services will be required and that I will be in the chorus".

By the middle of 1950 Holst's professional focus was changing. She had attended the first two <a href="Aldeburgh%20Festival">Aldeburgh Festival</a>s in 1948 and 1949, and in 1950 accepted a commission to provide a choral work for performance at the 1951 festival; The work was the song cycle for female voices and harp, "Welcome Joy and Welcome Sorrow". Sensing that it was time to leave Dartington, she gave a year's notice, part of which was spent on sabbatical, studying Indian music at <a href="Rabindranath%20Tagore">Rabindranath Tagore</a>'s university in West Bengal. A fruit of this visit was her "Ten Indian Folk Tunes" for recorder. On 21 July 1951 her one-act opera, "Benedick and Beatrice", was performed at Dartington, to mark her departure.

Without definite plans for her future after Dartington, Holst toured Europe, collecting music that she would later edit for performance, including madrigals by <a href="Carlo%20Gesualdo">Carlo Gesualdo</a> which she found "very exciting". At home, although not formally employed by Britten, she worked with him on several projects, including a new performing version of Purcell's "<a href="Dido%20and%20Aeneas">Dido and Aeneas</a>", and the preparation of the vocal and full scores for Britten's opera "<a href="Billy%20Budd%20%28opera%29">Billy Budd</a>". Pears, who had observed Holst's overall contributions to musical life at Dartington, believed she could help Britten and the Aldeburgh Festival on a more formal basis, and shortly after the 1952 festival Britten invited her to come and work with him. She agreed, and moved to lodgings in Aldeburgh.

When Holst joined Britten, the financial arrangement was vague; Britten paid her on a piecemeal basis rather than a regular salary, unaware that she had made over her rights to her father's estate to her mother and had little money of her own. As a result, she lived very frugally in Aldeburgh, but her commitment to Britten overrode her own physical comfort. For the next dozen years her life was organised around the joint objectives of assisting Britten and developing the Aldeburgh Festival. Alongside this work, she made many choral and vocal arrangements, promoted her father's music, and wrote books, articles and programme notes.

For the first 18 months of her association with Britten, Holst kept a diary which, Grogan says, forms a record of her "unconditional belief in Britten's achievement and status, and her absolute devotion to his work". The first of Britten's works to which she made a significant contribution was the opera "<a href="Gloriana">Gloriana</a>", scheduled to form part of the <a href="Coronation%20of%20Queen%20Elizabeth%20II">1953 Coronation celebrations</a>. The short timescale for the writing of the opera placed considerable pressure on the composer and his new assistant, strains that were dramatised 60 years later in a radio play, "Imo and Ben". Holst's main task with "Gloriana" was to copy Britten's pencil sketches and prepare the vocal and piano scores which the singers needed for rehearsals by February 1953. Later she assisted him with the writing of the full orchestral score, and performed similar services with his next opera, "<a href="The%20Turn%20of%20the%20Screw%20%28opera%29">The Turn of the Screw</a>" (1954). When Britten was under pressure during the composition of his ballet "The Prince of the Pagodas" (1956), Holst accompanied him to Switzerland, to remain by his side as he completed the work. She took great pleasure in her association with Britten's opera for children, "<a href="Noye%27s%20Fludde">Noye's Fludde</a>" (1957), for which she showed Britten how to achieve a unique raindrop effect by hitting a row of china mugs with a wooden spoon. She and Britten combined to collect and publish music for the recorder, in a series published by Boosey and Hawkes (1954–59), and jointly wrote a popular introductory book, "The Story of Music" (1958).

Holst continued to assist Britten with all his major compositions until 1964, at that point she determined to give priority to the final securing of her father's musical legacy, to re-establish her career as a composer, and to pursue a more independent path. She relinquished her post as Britten's assistant, while remaining personally devoted to Britten. She did not leave Aldeburgh, and continued her work with the annual Aldeburgh Festival.

In 1956 Holst's role in the Aldeburgh Festival was formalised when she joined Britten and Pears as one of the festival's artistic directors, taking responsibility for programmes and performers. For the 1956 festival she scheduled a performance of Gustav Holst's opera "<a href="Savitri%20%28opera%29">Savitri</a>", the first of several Gustav Holst works that she introduced to the festival in the ensuing years. "Savitri" was offered as part of a double bill that included Imogen's arrangement of <a href="John%20Blow">John Blow</a>'s 17th century opera "<a href="Venus%20and%20Adonis%20%28opera%29">Venus and Adonis</a>". In 1957 she instituted late-night concerts, and in 1962 she organised a series devoted to <a href="Flemish%20music%23Classical%20music">Flemish music</a>, in which she had recently become interested. She also devised frequent programmes of church music, for performance at Aldeburgh parish church. Since moving to Aldeburgh in 1952, Holst had lived in a series of lodgings and rented flats. In 1962 she moved to a small contemporary bungalow built for her in Church Walk, where she lived for the rest of her life. The house was built on the edge of the site where it had been hoped to build a Festival Theatre. When that plan was abandoned in favour of a move to <a href="Snape%20Maltings">Snape Maltings</a>, the bungalow was built anyway by the architect H. T. Cadbury-Brown, who allowed Holst to live there rent-free.

In 1964 Holst began composing again, and in 1965 accepted commissions for two large-scale works: "The Sun's Journey", a cantata for female voices, and the "Trianon Suite", composed for the Trianon Youth Orchestra of <a href="Ipswich">Ipswich</a>. In 1965 and 1966 she published two books, studies of Bach and Britten. The latter work caused some shock and surprise by failing to mention the contributions to Britten's successes of several key figures in Britten's earlier career who had subsequently fallen out of favour, such as his former librettists <a href="Eric%20Crozier">Eric Crozier</a> and <a href="Ronald%20Duncan">Ronald Duncan</a>. Between 1966 and 1970 Holst recorded a number of her father's works with the Purcell Singers and the <a href="English%20Chamber%20Orchestra">English Chamber Orchestra</a>, under the Argo and Lyrita labels. Among these recordings was the "Double Violin Concerto", which she conducted with <a href="Emanuel%20Hurwitz">Emanuel Hurwitz</a> as soloist. Forty years earlier she had acted as the rehearsal pianist before the work's first performance.
Holst had formed the Purcell Singers, a small semi-professional choir, in October 1952, largely at the instigation of Pears. From 1954 the choir became regular performers at the Aldeburgh Festival, with programmes ranging from rarely heard medieval music to 20th-century works. Among choir members who later achieved individual distinction were the bass-baritone <a href="John%20Shirley-Quirk">John Shirley-Quirk</a>, the tenors <a href="Robert%20Tear">Robert Tear</a> and <a href="Philip%20Langridge">Philip Langridge</a>, and the founder and conductor of the Heinrich Schütz Choir, <a href="Roger%20Norrington">Roger Norrington</a>. Langridge remembered with particular pleasure a performance in <a href="Orford%2C%20Suffolk">Orford</a> church of <a href="Thomas%20Tallis">Thomas Tallis</a>'s forty-part motet "<a href="Spem%20in%20alium">Spem in alium</a>", on 2 July 1963. When she gave up the conductorship of the choir in 1967, much of its musical mission, in particular its commitment to early music, was assumed by other groups, such as Norrington's Schütz Choir and the Purcell Consort formed by the ex-Purcell Singers chorister <a href="Grayston%20Burgess">Grayston Burgess</a>.

On 2 June 1967 Holst shared the podium with Britten in the concert inaugurating the Aldeburgh Festival's new home at the <a href="Snape%20Maltings">Snape Maltings</a>. From 1972 Holst was involved with the development of educational classes at the Maltings, which began with weekend singing classes and developed into the <a href="Britten-Pears%20School%20for%20Advanced%20Musical%20Studies">Britten-Pears School for Advanced Musical Studies</a>, with its own training orchestra. By this time Imogen's performances at the festival had become increasingly rare, but in 1975 she conducted a concert of Gustav Holst's brass band music, held outdoors at <a href="Framlingham%20Castle">Framlingham Castle</a>. A report of the event described an evening of "persistent drizzle ... until a diminutive figure in a special scarlet dress took the conductor's baton. The band was transformed, and played Holst's Suite as it has never been played before".

Britten had been in poor health since undergoing heart surgery in 1973, and on 4 December 1976 he died. Holst was unsure that she could maintain a working relationship with Pears alone, and on reaching the age of 70 in 1977, decided she would retire as artistic director after that year's festival. She made her final festival appearance as a performer when she stood in for the indisposed conductor <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Previn">André Previn</a> at the Snape Maltings Training Orchestra's inaugural festival concert. On retirement, she accepted the honorary title of Artistic Director Emeritus.

Gustav Holst's centenary was celebrated in 1974, when Imogen published a "Thematic Catalogue of Gustav Holst's Music". The centenary was the occasion for the publication of the first volume of a facsimile edition of Gustav Holst's manuscripts, on which Imogen worked with the help of the composer <a href="Colin%20Matthews">Colin Matthews</a>. Three more facsimile volumes followed in the years up to 1983, at which point the increasing costs, and Imogen's failing health led to the abandonment of the project. As part of the 1974 centenary, she negotiated performances of "Savitri" and "<a href="The%20Wandering%20Scholar">The Wandering Scholar</a>" at Aldeburgh and <a href="Sadler%27s%20Wells">Sadler's Wells</a>, and helped to arrange exhibitions of Gustav Holst's life and works at Aldeburgh and the <a href="Royal%20Festival%20Hall">Royal Festival Hall</a>.

Apart from her books concerned with her father's life and works, Holst continued to write on other aspects of music. In addition to numerous articles she published a short study of the Renaissance composer <a href="William%20Byrd">William Byrd</a> (1972) and a handbook for conductors of amateur choirs (1973). She continued to compose, usually short pieces but with occasional larger-scale orchestral works such as the "Woodbridge Suite" (1970) and the "Deben Calendar" (1977), the latter a series of twelve sketches depicting the River Deben in Suffolk at different phases of the year. Her last major composition was a String Quintet, written in 1982 and performed in October of that year by the <a href="Endellion%20Quartet">Endellion Quartet</a>, augmented by the cellist <a href="Steven%20Isserlis">Steven Isserlis</a>.

In 1976, she took legal action over a recording by Japanese electronic composer <a href="Isao%20Tomita">Isao Tomita</a> of 'The Planets', calling it 'unworthy of my father's creation'. The record, originally issued on the RCA label, was withdrawn from sale, and vinyl copies have subsequently become very rare.

In April 1979 Holst was present when the <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20The%20Queen%20Mother">Queen Mother</a> opened the new Britten–Pears School building in Snape. The building included a new library—the Gustav Holst Library—to which Holst had donated a large amount of material, including books which her father had used in his own teaching career. She had intended that, after 1977, her retirement from the Aldeburgh Festival would be total, but she made an exception in 1980 when she organised a 70th birthday celebration concert for Pears.

Shortly after the 1977 Aldeburgh Festival, Holst became seriously ill with what she described as "a coronary angina". Thereafter, <a href="angina">angina</a> was a recurrent problem, although she continued to work and fulfil engagements. However, by early 1984 the deterioration in her health was noticeable to her friends. She died at home of heart failure on 9 March 1984 and was buried in <a href="St%20Peter%20and%20St%20Paul%27s%20Church%2C%20Aldeburgh">Aldeburgh churchyard</a> five days later in a plot a few yards away from Britten's. An obituary tribute in the magazine "Early Music" emphasised her long association with music in the Aldeburgh church, where she "[brought] iridescently to life facets of that tradition to which her own life had been dedicated and which she presented as a continuing source of strength and wonder". Ursula Vaughan Williams wrote: "Imogen had something of the medieval scholar about her ... content with few creature comforts if there was enough music, enough work, enough books to fill her days. Indeed, she always filled her days, making twenty-four hours contain what most of us need twice that time to do".

In 2007, Holst's centenary was recognised at Aldeburgh by several special events, including a recital in the parish church by the Navarra Quartet in which works by Purcell and Schubert were mixed with Imogen's own "The Fall of the Leaf" for solo cello, and the String Quintet. The latter work was described by Andrew Clements in "The Guardian" as "genuinely memorable ... The set of variations with which the quintet ends dissolves into a series of bare solo lines, linking Holst's music to her father's".

Holst never married, though she enjoyed a number of romantic friendships, notably with the future poet Miles Tomalin, whom she met when she was a pupil at St Paul's. The two were close until 1929, and exchanged poetry; Tomalin married in 1931. Many years after the relationship ended, Holst admitted to Britten that she would have married Tomalin.

Holst was made a Fellow of the Royal College of Music in 1966. She was awarded <a href="Honorary%20degree">honorary doctorates</a> from the universities of <a href="University%20of%20Essex">Essex</a> (1968), <a href="University%20of%20Exeter">Exeter</a> (1969), and <a href="University%20of%20Leeds">Leeds</a> (1983). She was given honorary membership of the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Music">Royal Academy of Music</a> in 1970. Holst was appointed a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (CBE) in the <a href="1975%20New%20Year%20Honours">1975 New Year Honours</a> for services to music.

Imogen Holst was a part-time composer, intermittently productive within her extensive portfolio of musical activities. In her earlier years she was among a group of young British women composers—<a href="Elizabeth%20Maconchy">Elizabeth Maconchy</a> and <a href="Elisabeth%20Lutyens">Elisabeth Lutyens</a> were others—whose music was regularly performed and broadcast. According to a later critic, her "Mass in A" of 1927 showed "confident and imaginative layering of voices, building to a satisfying Agnus Dei". However, for long periods in her subsequent career Holst barely composed at all. After the RCM, her most active years as a composer were at Dartington in the 1940s and the "post-Britten" period after 1964. Her output of compositions, arrangements and edited music is extensive but has received only limited critical attention. Much of it is unpublished and has usually been neglected after its initial performance.
The oeuvre comprises instrumental, vocal, orchestral and choral music. Holst was primarily influenced, as Gustav Holst's daughter, by what the analyst Christopher Tinker terms "her natural and inescapable relationship with the English musical establishment", by her close personal relationship with her father, and her love of folksong. Some of her first compositions reflect the pastoralism of <a href="Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams">Ralph Vaughan Williams</a>, who taught her at the RCM. In her teaching and EFDSS years during the 1930s she became known for her folksong arrangements but composed little music herself. The personal style that emerged in the 1940s incorporated her affinity with folksong and dance, her intense interest in English music of the 16th and 17th centuries, and her taste for innovation. In her 1930 suite for solo viola, she had begun experimenting with scale patterns; by the 1940s she was incorporating her own six- and eight-note scales into her chamber music and occasionally into choral works such as the "Five Songs" (1944). This experimentation reappears in later works; in "Hallo My Fancy" (1972) a new scale is introduced for each verse, while the choir provides free harmonisation to a solo voice. In "Homage to William Morris" (1984), among her final works, Tinker notes her use of <a href="Consonance%20and%20dissonance">dissonance</a> "to add strength to the musical articulation of the text". By contrast, the String Quintet of 1982, the work which Holst herself thought made her "a real composer", is characterised by the warmth of its harmonies.

Much of Holst's choral music was written for amateur performance. Critics have observed a clear distinction in quality between these pieces and the choral works written for professional choirs, particularly those for women's voices. These latter pieces, says Tinker, incorporate her best work as an original composer. Record companies were slow in recognising her commercial potential, and not until 2009 was a CD issued devoted entirely to her music—a selection of her works for strings. The "Guardian"s reviewer welcomed the recording: "[T]here is a great deal of English music of far less worth that is frequently praised to the skies". In 2012 a selection of her choral music, sung by the <a href="Clare%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Clare College</a> Choir, was recorded by Harmonia Mundi. One review of this recording picks out "Welcome Joy and Welcome Sorrow", written for female voices with harp accompaniment, as "[giving] an insight into her own, softly nuanced, pioneering voice". Another mentions the "Three Psalms" setting, where "inner rhythms are underscored by the subtle string ostinatos pulsing beneath".

Imogen Holst also wrote numerous articles, pamphlets, essays, introductions and programme notes during the period 1935–1984.

Planet Stories

Planet Stories was an American <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp</a> <a href="science%20fiction%20magazine">science fiction magazine</a>, published by <a href="Fiction%20House">Fiction House</a> between 1939 and 1955. It featured interplanetary adventures, both in space and on some <a href="exoplanet">other planets</a>, and was initially focused on a young readership. Malcolm Reiss was editor or editor-in-chief for all of its 71 issues. "Planet Stories" was launched at the same time as "<a href="Planet%20Comics">Planet Comics</a>", the success of which probably helped to fund the early issues of "Planet Stories". "Planet Stories" did not pay well enough to regularly attract the leading science fiction writers of the day, but occasionally obtained work from well-known authors, including <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a> and <a href="Clifford%20D.%20Simak">Clifford D. Simak</a>. In 1952 "Planet Stories" published <a href="Philip%20K.%20Dick">Philip K. Dick</a>'s first sale, and printed four more of his stories over the next three years.

The two writers most identified with "Planet Stories" are <a href="Leigh%20Brackett">Leigh Brackett</a> and <a href="Ray%20Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a>, both of whom set many of their stories on a romanticized <a href="Mars%20in%20fiction">version of Mars</a> that owed much to the depiction of <a href="Barsoom">Barsoom</a> in the works of <a href="Edgar%20Rice%20Burroughs">Edgar Rice Burroughs</a>. Bradbury's work for "Planet" included an early story in his "<a href="The%20Martian%20Chronicles">Martian Chronicles</a>" sequence. Brackett's best-known work for the magazine was a series of adventures featuring Eric John Stark, which began in the summer of 1949. Brackett and Bradbury collaborated on one story, "Lorelei of the Red Mist", which appeared in 1946; it was generally well-received, although one letter to the magazine complained that the story's <a href="Sex%20and%20sexuality%20in%20speculative%20fiction">treatment of sex</a>, though mild by modern standards, was too explicit. The artwork also emphasized attractive women, with a scantily clad <a href="damsel%20in%20distress">damsel in distress</a> or <a href="Extraterrestrials%20in%20fiction">alien</a> princess on almost every cover.

Although science fiction (sf) had been published before the 1920s, it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 of "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>", a pulp magazine published by <a href="Hugo%20Gernsback">Hugo Gernsback</a>. By the end of the 1930s the field was undergoing its first boom. Fiction House, a major pulp publisher, had run into difficulties during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Depression</a>, but after a relaunch in 1934 found success with <a href="Detective%20fiction">detective</a> and romance pulp titles. Fiction House's first title with sf interest was "<a href="Jungle%20Stories">Jungle Stories</a>", which was launched in early 1939; it was not primarily a science fiction magazine, but often featured storylines with marginally science fictional themes, such as survivors from <a href="Atlantis">Atlantis</a>. At the end of 1939, Fiction House decided to add an sf magazine to its lineup; it was titled "Planet Stories", and was published by Love Romances, a subsidiary company that had been created to publish Fiction House's romance titles. The first issue was dated Winter 1939. Two comics were launched at the same time: "<a href="Jungle%20Comics">Jungle Comics</a>" and "Planet Comics"; both were published monthly, whereas "Planet Stories" was quarterly, and it is quite likely that the success of the comics funded the early issues of the pulps.

Malcolm Reiss edited "Planet Stories" from the beginning, and retained editorial oversight and control throughout its run, though he was not always the named editor on the <a href="masthead%20%28publishing%29">masthead</a>; when other editors were involved, his title was "managing editor". The first of these sub-editors was Wilbur S. Peacock, who took over with the Fall 1942 issue and remained until Fall 1945, after which he was replaced by Chester Whitehorn for three issues, and then by Paul L. Payne, from Fall 1946 to Spring 1950.

With the Summer 1950 issue the editorship passed to <a href="Jerome%20Bixby">Jerome Bixby</a>, who was already editing "Jungle Stories". Soon thereafter "Planet Stories" switched from a quarterly to bimonthly schedule. Bixby lasted a little over a year; Malcolm Reiss took over again in September 1951, and three issues later, in March 1952, Jack O'Sullivan became editor. A contemporary market survey records that in 1953, payment rates were only one to two cents per word; this was substantially less than the leading magazines of the day. "Planet Stories" returned to a quarterly schedule beginning with the Summer 1954 issue, but the pulp market was collapsing, and the Summer 1955 issue was the final one.

Fiction House apparently made the decision to launch "Planet Stories" so quickly that there was little time for Reiss to obtain new stories, so he worked with <a href="Julius%20Schwartz">Julius Schwartz</a> and other authors' agents to fill the first issue. The results were unremarkable, but Reiss was energetic, and was able to improve the quality of fiction in succeeding issues, though he occasionally apologized to the readers for printing weak material. The magazine was exclusively focused on interplanetary adventures, often taking place in primitive societies that would now be regarded as "<a href="sword%20and%20sorcery">sword and sorcery</a>" settings, and was aimed at a young readership; the result was a mixture of what became known as <a href="space%20opera">space opera</a> and <a href="planetary%20romance">planetary romance</a>s—<a href="melodrama">melodrama</a>tic tales of action and adventure on alien planets and in interplanetary space. "Planet Stories" relied on a few authors to provide the bulk of its fiction in the early years, with <a href="Nelson%20S.%20Bond">Nelson Bond</a> providing eight lead stories, some of them novels. Fourteen more were written by <a href="Ray%20Cummings">Ray Cummings</a> and <a href="Ross%20Rocklynne">Ross Rocklynne</a>; and <a href="Leigh%20Brackett">Leigh Brackett</a> was also a regular contributor, with seventeen stories in total published over the lifetime of the magazine.

The letter column in "Planet Stories" was titled "The Vizigraph"; it was very active, with long letters from an engaged readership. It often printed letters from established writers, and from fans who would go on to become well known professionally: <a href="Damon%20Knight">Damon Knight</a>'s letters are described by sf historian <a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28writer%29">Mike Ashley</a> as "legendary"; and <a href="Robert%20Silverberg">Robert Silverberg</a> commented in a letter in the Summer 1950 issue that Ray Bradbury "certainly gets some original ideas, if not good ones". The editors put a good deal of effort into keeping the letter column friendly and lively; contemporary writer and editor <a href="Robert%20A.%20W.%20Lowndes">Robert Lowndes</a> recalls that "Reiss was sincere and urbane; Wilbur [Peacock] enjoyed taking his coat off and being one of the crowd".

Despite the focus on melodramatic space adventure, the fiction in "Planet Stories" improved over the next few years, largely due to the work of Brackett and Bradbury. Both writers set many of their stories on a romanticized version of <a href="Mars">Mars</a> that owed much to the <a href="Barsoom">Barsoom</a> of <a href="Edgar%20Rice%20Burroughs">Edgar Rice Burroughs</a>. Brackett's writing improved during the 1940s from formulaic pulp adventure to a more mature style, and she became the most accomplished writer of planetary romances of her day. She wrote a well-received series of stories featuring adventurer <a href="Eric%20John%20Stark">Eric John Stark</a>, which began in the Summer 1949 "Planet Stories" with "Queen of the Martian Catacombs". Her work had a strong influence on other writers, in particular <a href="Gardner%20Fox">Gardner F. Fox</a>, <a href="Lin%20Carter">Lin Carter</a> and <a href="Marion%20Zimmer%20Bradley">Marion Zimmer Bradley</a>, Brackett later argued that "the so-called space opera is the folk-tale, the hero-tale of our particular niche in history". Also arguing in support of "Planet Stories", science fiction critic <a href="John%20Clute">John Clute</a> has commented that "the content was far more sophisticated than the covers".

Bradbury's work for "Planet Stories" included two of the stories that he later incorporated into "<a href="The%20Martian%20Chronicles">The Martian Chronicles</a>", including "The Million Year Picnic"; only one other story in the series had appeared before this. He also collaborated on a story with Brackett, "Lorelei of the Red Mist", based on an idea of hers, which appeared in the Summer of 1946. His stories for "Planet" demonstrate his reservations about the advance of technology, in particular "The Golden Apples of the Sun" (November 1953), and "A Sound of Thunder" (January 1954, reprinted from the June 28, 1952 issue of "<a href="Collier%27s%20Weekly">Collier's Weekly</a>"). Bradbury's work in "Planet Stories" is regarded by one pulp historian, Tim de Forest, as "the magazine's most important contribution to the genre".

Several other well-known writers appeared in "Planet Stories", including <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>, <a href="Clifford%20D.%20Simak">Clifford Simak</a>, <a href="James%20Blish">James Blish</a>, <a href="Fredric%20Brown">Fredric Brown</a> and Damon Knight. Asimov's story, originally titled "Pilgrimage", appeared in 1942; Asimov had been unable to sell the piece elsewhere, and rewrote it numerous times for different editors, adding a religious element at <a href="John%20W.%20Campbell">John Campbell</a>'s request, and removing it again when Malcolm Reiss asked for further changes. Reiss bought it but changed the name to "Black Friar of the Flame".

Jerome Bixby, who took over as editor in 1950, was a published writer and was knowledgeable about sf, though he had primarily written <a href="western%20fiction">western fiction</a>. In his short tenure he did much to improve the magazine, persuading the established writers to produce better material and finding unusual variations on the interplanetary adventure theme such as <a href="Poul%20Anderson">Poul Anderson</a>'s "Duel on Syrtis" in March 1951, about an Earthman tracking an alien on Mars, and <a href="Theodore%20Sturgeon">Theodore Sturgeon</a>'s "The Incubi on Planet X", about aliens who kidnap Earth women. After Bixby's departure in 1952, "Planet Stories" major contribution to the genre was the discovery of <a href="Philip%20K.%20Dick">Philip K. Dick</a>, whose first sale, "<a href="Beyond%20Lies%20the%20Wub">Beyond Lies the Wub</a>", appeared in the July 1952 issue. Dick went on to sell another four stories to "Planet Stories" over the next two years, including "James P. Crow", in which a human suffers discrimination in a world of robots.

"Planet Stories" clearly targeted a young readership, and the simultaneous launch in 1939 of "Planet Comics" may have been instrumental in attracting young readers to science fiction, but Ashley suggests that it is more likely that "Planet Stories" attracted experienced readers of the genre who "still yearned for the early days of sf". Critic and sf historian Thomas Clareson has commented that ""Planet" seemed to look backward towards the 1930s and earlier", an impression that was strengthened by the extensive use of interior artwork by <a href="Frank%20R.%20Paul">Frank Paul</a>, who had been the cover artist for the early Gernsback magazines in the 1920s. Paul's distinctive style was strongly associated with the early years of the field. The cover art was also melodramatic, with beautiful women—sometimes human, sometimes princesses from other planets—and threatening aliens. The subheading on the cover read "Strange Adventures on Other Worlds – The Universe of Future Centuries" until the end of 1946.

Although almost every story that appeared in "Planet" could be described as space opera, there was some variety of approach to the basic themes. Earth was sometimes threatened, but more often the action took place on other worlds, bringing Earthmen into local conflicts. This often involved beautiful native princesses, though the romantic storylines were stereotyped: in one story which appeared in Fall 1940, Carl Selwyn's "Venus Has Green Eyes", the Venusian princess is dissuaded from her hatred of humans when the hero seizes her and kisses her; she slaps him, but succumbs to his charm. Some respite from these depictions of women was provided by Leigh Brackett, who described her own heroines as "usually on the bitchy side—warm-blooded, hot-tempered, but gutty and intelligent" (with "bitchy" intended as a compliment). During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, it was in "Planet Stories" that a reader was most likely to come across a female character who could fight, instead of merely being fought over. Sex itself had long been taboo in the pulp magazines, but some stories in "Planet" depicted sexuality more directly than the competing magazines would. The readers were not always accepting; one reader in a letter in 1949 supported "jettisoning the taboos", but a letter writer in 1946 objected to "Lorelei of the Red Mist", saying that he needed "a pint of <a href="Listerine">Listerine</a> to wash the dirty taste out of my mouth". The cover artwork generally emphasized sex as well, with what sf author and critic <a href="Harry%20Harrison%20%28writer%29">Harry Harrison</a> sardonically referred to as "sexual dimorphism in space": heavy, functional spacesuits for the men, and transparent suits through which <a href="bikini">bikini</a>s or swimsuits could be seen for the women.

<a href="Hannes%20Bok">Hannes Bok</a> contributed much of the interior artwork, and the covers were often by Allen Anderson during the early years. Later, <a href="Frank%20Kelly%20Freas">Kelly Freas</a> became a frequent cover artist. One of the best artists to work on "Planet" was <a href="Alexander%20Leydenfrost">Alexander Leydenfrost</a>, whose work, according to Clareson, "epitomized much of what "Planet Stories" represented in the 1940s", though his cover artwork was less impressive than his black-and-white interior illustrations. Artist and sf historian <a href="David%20A.%20Hardy">David Hardy</a> has described Leydenfrost's black and white illustrations as "almost <a href="Rembrandt">Rembrandt</a>ian in his use of light and shade".

The editorial succession at "Planet" was:

"Planet Stories" was a <a href="Pulp%20magazine">pulp-sized</a> magazine for all of its 71 issues. It was 128 pages for most of its existence, and was priced at 20 cents. With the November 1950 issue the page count was cut to 112, and the price went up to 25 cents. The page count was reduced to 96 for one issue in March 1952, but then returned to 112 until Summer 1954, when it was again reduced to 96 pages for the last five issues.

"Planet" began as a quarterly. A brief attempt was made to switch to a bimonthly schedule in 1943; a March and May issue appeared, but the next issue was titled Fall 1943, inaugurating another quarterly period. The Fall 1950 issue was followed by November 1950, and this began a bimonthly period that lasted until May 1954, which was followed by a Summer 1954 issue. A quarterly schedule resumed until the end; unusually, the winter issue that year was dated Winter 1954/55, rather than with a single year. The volume numbering was consistent throughout the magazine's publication, with five volumes of 12 issues and a final volume of 11, but there were three errors in the volume numbering printed on the spine (though not on the masthead): issue 5/10 was given as 5/8 on the spine; issue 5/11 was given as 6/3 on the spine; and issue 6/11 was given as 6/12 on the spine.

A British reprint edition appeared between March 1950 and September 1954; the issues were numbered but not dated, and were heavily cut, with only 64 to 68 pages. There are twelve issues known; a thirteenth has been rumored but not seen by any sf <a href="bibliography">bibliographers</a>. The publisher was <a href="Pembertons">Pembertons</a>, though some sources indicate that <a href="Streamline%20Publications">Streamline Publications</a> was the publisher of the first issue. Issues 7 and 8 of the British edition also contained nonfiction material reprinted from "<a href="Startling%20Stories">Startling Stories</a>" and "<a href="Wonder%20Stories">Thrilling Wonder</a>". A Canadian edition was published by <a href="American%20News%20Co.">American News Co.</a>, from Fall 1948 to March 1951 (a total of twelve issues); these were identical to the corresponding U.S. editions.

In the summer of 1950 Fiction House launched a companion magazine to "Planet". It was titled "<a href="Two%20Complete%20Science-Adventure%20Books">Two Complete Science-Adventure Books</a>"; the policy was to print two novels in a single magazine. It appeared three times a year and lasted until the spring of 1954. In 1953 Fiction House launched a reprint magazine, "<a href="Tops%20in%20Science%20Fiction">Tops in Science Fiction</a>", selecting the contents from the backfile of stories that had appeared in "Planet". It only lasted for two issues, the second of which received almost no distribution.

A derivative anthology, "The Best of Planet Stories" #1, appeared in 1975 from Ballantine Books, edited by Leigh Brackett, containing seven stories reprinted from between 1942 and 1952. It was intended to be the first of a series, but no further volumes appeared.

The General in His Labyrinth

The General in His Labyrinth (original Spanish title: ) is a 1989 <a href="dictator%20novel">dictator novel</a> by <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a>n writer and <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20for%20Literature">Nobel laureate</a> <a href="Gabriel%20Garc%C3%ADa%20M%C3%A1rquez">Gabriel García Márquez</a>. It is a fictionalized account of the last seven months of <a href="Sim%C3%B3n%20Bol%C3%ADvar">Simón Bolívar</a>, liberator and leader of <a href="Gran%20Colombia">Gran Colombia</a>. The book traces Bolívar's final journey from <a href="Bogot%C3%A1">Bogotá</a> to the Caribbean coastline of <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a> in his attempt to leave South America for exile in Europe. Breaking with the traditional heroic portrayal of Bolívar , García Márquez depicts a pathetic protagonist, a prematurely aged man who is physically ill and mentally exhausted. The story explores the labyrinth of Bolívar's life through the narrative of his memories, in which "despair, sickness, and death inevitably win out over love, health, and life".

Following the success of "<a href="One%20Hundred%20Years%20of%20Solitude">One Hundred Years of Solitude</a>" and "<a href="Love%20in%20the%20Time%20of%20Cholera">Love in the Time of Cholera</a>", García Márquez decided to write about the "Great Liberator" after reading an unfinished novel by his friend <a href="%C3%81lvaro%20Mutis">Álvaro Mutis</a>. He borrowed the setting—Bolívar's voyage down the <a href="Magdalena%20River">Magdalena River</a> in 1830—from Mutis. García Márquez spent two years researching the subject, encompassing the extensive memoirs of Bolívar's Irish <a href="aide-de-camp">aide-de-camp</a>, <a href="Daniel%20Florencio%20O%27Leary">Daniel Florencio O'Leary</a>, as well as numerous other historical documents and consultations with academics.

Its mixture of genres makes "The General in His Labyrinth" difficult to classify, and commentators disagree over where it lies on the scale between novel and historical account. García Márquez's insertion of interpretive and fictionalized elements—some dealing with Bolívar's most intimate moments—initially caused outrage in parts of <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>. Many prominent Latin American figures believed that the novel portrayed a negative image to the outside world of one of the region's most important historic figures. Others saw "The General in His Labyrinth" as a tonic for Latin American culture and a challenge to the region to deal with its problems.

The initial idea to write a book about <a href="Sim%C3%B3n%20Bol%C3%ADvar">Simón Bolívar</a> came to <a href="Garc%C3%ADa%20M%C3%A1rquez">García Márquez</a> through his friend and fellow Colombian writer <a href="%C3%81lvaro%20Mutis">Álvaro Mutis</a>, to whom the book is dedicated. Mutis had started writing a book called about Bolívar's final voyage along the Magdalena River, but never finished it. At the time, García Márquez was interested in writing about the Magdalena River because he knew the area intimately from his childhood. Two years after reading , García Márquez asked Mutis for his permission to write a book on Bolívar's last voyage.

García Márquez believed that most of the information available on Bolívar was one-dimensional: "No one ever said in Bolívar's biographies that he sang or that he was constipated ... but historians don't say these things because they think they are not important." In the epilogue to the novel, García Márquez writes that he researched the book for two years; the task was difficult, both because of his lack of experience in conducting historical research, and the lack of documentary evidence for the events of the final period of Bolívar's life.

García Márquez researched a wide variety of historical documents, including Bolívar's letters, 19th-century newspapers, and <a href="Daniel%20Florencio%20O%27Leary">Daniel Florencio O'Leary</a>'s 34 volumes of memoirs. He engaged the help of various experts, among them geographer Gladstone Oliva; historian and fellow Colombian Eugenio Gutiérrez Celys, who had co-written a book called with historian Fabio Puyo; and astronomer Jorge Perezdoval—García Márquez used an inventory drawn up by Perezdoval to describe which nights Bolívar spent under a full moon. García Márquez also worked closely with Antonio Bolívar Goyanes, a distant relative of Bolívar, during the extensive editing of the book.

The novel is set in 1830, at the tail end of the initial campaign to secure Latin America's independence from Spain. Most of <a href="Hispanic%20America">Spanish America</a> had gained independence by this date; only <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> and <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a> remained under Spanish rule.

Within a few decades of <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>'s landing on the coast of what is now <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> in 1498, South America had been effectively conquered by Spain and <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a>. By the beginning of the 19th century, several factors affected Spain's control over its colonies: <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>'s <a href="Peninsular%20War">invasion of Spain</a> in 1808, the abdication of <a href="Charles%20IV%20of%20Spain">Charles IV</a>, <a href="Ferdinand%20VII">Ferdinand VII</a>'s renouncement of his right to succeed, and the placement of <a href="Joseph%20Bonaparte">Joseph Bonaparte</a> on the Spanish throne. The colonies were virtually cut off from Spain, and the <a href="American%20revolution">American</a> and <a href="French%20revolution">French</a> Revolutions inspired many <a href="Creole%20peoples">creoles</a>—American-born descendants of Spanish settlers—to take advantage of Spanish weakness. As a result, Latin America was run by independent "<a href="juntas">juntas</a>" and colonial self-governments.

The early 19th century saw the first attempts at securing liberation from Spain, which were led in northern South America by Bolívar. He and the independence movements won numerous battles in Venezuela, <a href="United%20Provinces%20of%20New%20Granada">New Granada</a> and present-day <a href="Ecuador">Ecuador</a> and <a href="Peru">Peru</a>. His dream of uniting the Spanish American nations under one central government was almost achieved. However, shortly after the South American colonies became independent of Spain, problems developed in the capitals, and civil wars were sparked in some provinces; Bolívar lost many of his supporters and fell ill. Opposition to his presidency continued to increase, and in 1830, after 11 years of rule, he resigned as president of Gran Colombia.

The novel is written in the third-person with flashbacks to specific events in the life of Simón Bolívar, "the General". It begins on May 8, 1830 in <a href="Santa%20Fe%20de%20Bogot%C3%A1">Santa Fe de Bogotá</a>. The General is preparing for his journey towards the port of <a href="Cartagena%2C%20Colombia">Cartagena de Indias</a>, intending to leave Colombia for Europe. Following his resignation as President of <a href="Gran%20Colombia">Gran Colombia</a>, the people of the lands he liberated have now turned against him, scrawling anti-Bolívar graffiti and throwing waste at him. The General is anxious to move on, but has to remind the Vice-President-elect, General <a href="Domingo%20Caycedo">Domingo Caycedo</a>, that he has yet to receive a valid passport to leave the country. The General leaves Bogotá with the few officials still faithful to him, including his confidante and aide-de-camp, José Palacios. At the end of the first chapter, the General is referred to by his full title, General Simón José Antonio de la Santísima Trinidad Bolívar y Palacios, for the only time in the novel.

On the first night of the voyage, the General stays at <a href="Facatativ%C3%A1">Facatativá</a> with his entourage, which consists of José Palacios, five aides-de-camp, his clerks, and his dogs. Here, as throughout the journey that follows, the General's loss of prestige is evident; the downturn in his fortunes surprises even the General himself. His unidentified illness has led to his physical deterioration, which makes him unrecognizable, and his aide-de-camp is constantly mistaken for the Liberator.

After many delays, the General and his party arrive in <a href="Honda%2C%20Tolima">Honda</a>, where the Governor, Posada Gutiérrez, has arranged for three days of fiestas. On his last night in Honda, the General returns late to camp and finds one of his old friends, Miranda Lyndsay, waiting for him. The General recalls that fifteen years ago, she had learned of a plot against his life and had saved him. The following morning, the General begins the voyage down the Magdalena River. Both his physical debilitation and pride are evident as he negotiates the slope to the dock: he is in need of a sedan chair but refuses to use it. The group stays a night in <a href="Puerto%20Real%20de%20la%20Cruz">Puerto Real</a>, where the General claims he sees a woman singing during the night. His aides-de-camp and the watchman conduct a search, but they fail to uncover any sign of a woman having been in the vicinity.

The General and his entourage arrive at the port of <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20de%20Mompox">Mompox</a>. Here they are stopped by police, who fail to recognize the General. They ask for his passport, but he is unable to produce one. Eventually, the police discover his identity and escort him into the port. The people still believe him to be the President of Gran Colombia and prepare banquets in his honor; but these festivities are wasted on him due to his lack of strength and appetite. After several days, the General and his entourage set off for <a href="Turbaco">Turbaco</a>.

The group spend a sleepless night in <a href="Barranca%20Nueva">Barranca Nueva</a> before they arrive in Turbaco. Their original plan was to continue to Cartagena the following day, but the General is informed that there is no available ship bound for Europe from the port and that his passport still has not arrived. While staying in the town, he receives a visit from General <a href="Mariano%20Montilla">Mariano Montilla</a> and a few other friends. The deterioration of his health becomes increasingly evident—one of his visitors describes his face as that of a dead man. In Turbaco, the General is joined by General Daniel Florencio O'Leary and receives news of ongoing political machinations: <a href="Joaqu%C3%ADn%20Mosquera">Joaquín Mosquera</a>, appointed successor as President of Gran Colombia, has assumed power but his legitimacy is still contested by General <a href="Rafael%20Urdaneta">Rafael Urdaneta</a>. The General recalls that his "dream began to fall apart on the very day it was realized".

The General finally receives his passport, and two days later he sets off with his entourage for Cartagena and the coast, where more receptions are held in his honor. Throughout this time, he is surrounded by women but is too weak to engage in sexual relations. The General is deeply affected when he hears that his good friend and preferred successor for the presidency, <a href="Antonio%20Jos%C3%A9%20de%20Sucre">Field Marshal Sucre</a>, has been ambushed and assassinated.

The General is now told by one of his aides-de-camp that General <a href="Rafael%20Urdaneta">Rafael Urdaneta</a> has taken over the government in Bogotá, and there are reports of demonstrations and riots in support of a return to power by Bolívar. The General's group travel to the town of <a href="Soledad%2C%20Atl%C3%A1ntico">Soledad</a>, where he stays for more than a month, his health declining further. In Soledad, the General agrees to see a physician for the first time.

The General never leaves South America. He finishes his journey in <a href="Santa%20Marta">Santa Marta</a>, too weak to continue and with only his doctor and his closest aides by his side. He dies in poverty, a shadow of the man who liberated much of the continent.

The leading character in the novel is "the General", also called "the Liberator". García Márquez only once names his <a href="protagonist">protagonist</a> as Simón Bolívar, the famous historical figure, whose full title was <a href="Sim%C3%B3n%20Bol%C3%ADvar">General Simón José Antonio de la Santísima Trinidad Bolívar y Palacios</a>, on whom the General's character is based. The novel's portrait of a national and Latin American hero, which challenges the historical record, provoked outrage in some quarters on its publication.

At the beginning of the novel, the General is 46 years old and slowly dying on his last journey to the port of <a href="Cartagena%2C%20Colombia">Cartagena de Indias</a>, where he plans to set sail for Europe. As Palencia-Roth notes, "Bolívar is cast here not only as a victim but as an agent of Latin America's tragic political flaws". The fortunes of the historical Simón Bolívar began to decline in 1824 after the victory of his general <a href="Antonio%20Jos%C3%A9%20de%20Sucre">Antonio José de Sucre</a> at <a href="Battle%20of%20Ayacucho">Ayacucho</a>. The novel draws on the fact that the historical Bolívar never remarried after the death of his wife, María Teresa Rodríguez del Toro y Alayza. García Márquez uses other documented facts as starting points for his fictional portrait of Bolívar–for example, his dedication to the army above all else, his premature aging, and his bad temper. Of the latter, Bolívar's <a href="aide-de-camp">aide-de-camp</a> O'Leary once remarked that "his imperious and impatient temperament would never tolerate the smallest delay in the execution of an order".

In an interview with María Elvira Samper, García Márquez has admitted that his portrayal of Bolívar is partly a self-portrait. He identifies with Bolívar in many ways, since their method of controlling their anger is the same and their philosophical views are similar: neither "pays much attention to death, because that distracts one from the most important thing: what one does in life".

The novel begins with the name of José Palacios, who, here as with the historical figure of the same name, is Bolívar's "long-serving mayordomo". As literary critic Seymour Menton observes, Palacios's "total identification with Bolívar constitutes the novel's frame". Palacios constantly waits on the General, and at certain times he alone is allowed in the General's room. He has learned to live with his master's unpredictability and does not presume to read his thoughts. Simultaneously, however, Palacios is also the General's closest confidante, the person best able to read his moods and share in his emotions. Born a slave, the character is six years younger than the General, and has spent his entire life in his service. Throughout the novel, Palacios provides the General with clarifications or reminders of dates and events during the General's time of disillusion. According to one critic, Palacios's ability to recall past events in Bolívar's life is essential for García Márquez's recreation of the character, as it allows the Bolívar of official history to be placed within the context of everyday life.

Manuela Sáenz is the General's long-time lover, his last since the death of his wife, 27 years earlier. Her character is based on Simón Bolívar's historical mistress <a href="Manuela%20S%C3%A1enz">Doña Manuela Sáenz de Thorne</a>, whom Bolívar dubbed "the liberator of the liberator" after she helped save him from an assassination attempt on the night of September 25, 1828. García Márquez's fictional portrait stimulated a reassessment of this historical figure, who is increasingly seen, according to Venezuelan historian Denzil Romero, "not just as a mistress but as the intelligent, independent, forceful woman she was". In the novel, she is described as "the bold Quiteña who loved him but was not going to follow him to his death". The General leaves Manuela Sáenz behind, but throughout the novel he writes to her on his journey. She also attempts to write letters to him with news of the political situation, but the mail carriers have been instructed not to accept her letters. Like the historical figure on whom she is based, the fictional Manuela Sáenz is married to Dr. James Thorne, an English physician twice her age. The historical Manuela Sáenz left Thorne after Bolívar wrote declaring his undying love for her. In the novel she is characterized as astute and indomitable, with "irresistible grace, a sense of power, and unbounded tenacity".

As he reflects on the past, the General often thinks and dreams about his former friend Francisco de Paula Santander. The historical <a href="Francisco%20de%20Paula%20Santander">Francisco de Paula Santander</a> was a friend of Simón Bolívar, but was later accused of complicity in a plot to assassinate him and sent into exile. In the novel, the General remembers that he had once appointed Santander to govern Colombia because he believed him to be an effective and brave soldier. He formerly regarded Santander as "his other self, and perhaps his better self", but by the time of the events in "The General in His Labyrinth" Santander has become the General's enemy and has been banished to Paris after his involvement in the assassination attempt. The General is depicted as tormented by the idea that Santander will return from his exile in France; he dreams, for example, that Santander is eating the pages of a book, that he is covered in cockroaches, and that he is plucking out his own eyeballs.

Field Marshal Antonio José de Sucre is portrayed as an intimate friend of the General. The historical <a href="Antonio%20Jos%C3%A9%20de%20Sucre">Antonio José de Sucre</a>, the Field Marshal of <a href="Battle%20of%20Ayacucho">Ayacucho</a>, had been the most trusted general of Simón Bolívar. García Márquez describes him as "intelligent, methodical, shy, and superstitious". The Field Marshal is married to and has a daughter with Doña <a href="Mariana%20Carcel%C3%A9n">Mariana Carcelén</a>. In the first chapter of the novel, the General asks Sucre to succeed him as President of the Republic, but he rejects the idea. One of the reasons Sucre gives is that he wishes only to live his life for his family. Also at the beginning of the novel, Sucre's death is foreshadowed. Sucre tells the General that he plans on celebrating the Feast of Saint Anthony in Quito with his family. When the General hears that Sucre has been assassinated in Berruecos on his way back to <a href="Quito">Quito</a>, he vomits blood.

The novel revolves around the fictionalized figure of Bolívar and includes many minor characters who are part of the General's travelling party, whom he meets on his journey or who come to him in his memories and dreams of his past. Sometimes they are identified by particular quirks or tied to small but significant events. They include, for instance, General <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Mar%C3%ADa%20Carre%C3%B1o">José María Carreño</a>, a member of the entourage, whose right arm was amputated after a combat wound, and who once revealed a military secret by talking in his sleep. At other times, they are prostheses for the General's now failing powers: Fernando, for example, the General's nephew, is "the most willing and patient of the General's many clerks", and the General wakes him "at any hour to have him read aloud from a dull book or take notes on urgent extemporizations". One of the least developed of the minor characters is the General's wife, María Teresa Rodríguez del Toro y Alayza, who had died, readers are told, in mysterious circumstances shortly after their marriage. The General has "buried her at the bottom of a water-tight oblivion as a brutal means of living without her"; she only fleetingly enters his memories in the book's last chapter. According to Menton, she is "upstaged" by Manuela Sáenz, whose later history García Márquez recounts as if she instead were the General's widow. María Teresa's death, however, marked the General's "birth into history", and he has never tried to replace her.

In "The General in His Labyrinth", García Márquez voices his political views through the character of the General. For example, Alvarez Borland points out that in the scene where the General responds to the French diplomat, his words closely reflect García Márquez's 1982 Nobel Address. The diplomat is critical of the barbarism in Latin America and the brutal means used in attempting to achieve independence. Bolívar replies by pointing out that Europe had centuries to progress to its current state, and that South America should be left to experience its "Middle Ages in peace". Similarly García Márquez remarks in his Nobel Speech that "venerable Europe would perhaps be more perceptive if it tried to see <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a> in its own past. If only it recalled that London took three hundred years to build its first city wall ...".

The novel was published in 1989, when the Soviet Union was disintegrating and the political map was being radically redrawn. Reviewing "The General in His Labyrinth" in 1990, the novelist <a href="Margaret%20Atwood">Margaret Atwood</a> pointed to another instance of García Márquez raising political issues through the character of the General. He has him tell his aide that the United States is "omnipotent and terrible, and that its tale of liberty will end in a plague of miseries for us all".
Atwood noted the contemporary relevance of this sentiment, since "the patterns of Latin American politics, and of United States intervention in them, have not changed much in 160 years." She suggested that García Márquez's fictionalization of Bolívar is a lesson "for our own turbulent age ... Revolutions have a long history of eating their progenitors." The central character is a man at the end of his life, who has seen his revolution and dream of a united Latin America fail.

According to literary critic David Danow, the labyrinth of the novel's title refers to "a series of labyrinths that are contingent upon matters of history, geography, and biography ... that consistently and conclusively result in a dead end"—in this case, the General's own death. His final voyage along the Magdalena River involves a doubling back and forth from one location to another that leads him and his followers nowhere. The labyrinth does not lead to happiness; instead, it results in madness from constant pondering on the past and an impossible future. At the end of his life, the General is reduced to a spectre of his former self. The labyrinth also recalls the <a href="labyrinth">labyrinth</a> built to imprison the <a href="minotaur">minotaur</a> in <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, and the endless travelling and searching of ancient Greek heroes. In Danow's view, "The Labyrinth mirrors the wanderings and travails of the hero in search for meaning and resolution to the vicissitudes of life".

García Márquez depicts the General's body itself as a labyrinth. His doctor observes that "everything that enters the body, adds weight, and everything that leaves it is debased." The General's body is described as a "labyrinth coming to a literal dead end". The labyrinth is also expressed in geographical and architectural imagery. The country's destiny is imagined as a break-up, a folding of north into south. The seas offer the hope of a new life and a new world, but the closer the General is to Colombia, the less chance he has of moving on. García Márquez describes buildings as "daunting, reverberating (if not exactly reiterating) with the echoes of a bloody past". The portrayal of the General's world as a labyrinth is underlined by his constant return to cities and towns he has visited before: each location belongs to the past as well as to the present. "The General in his Labyrinth" blurs the lines between perdition in a man-made world and wandering in the natural world.

Bolívar's fate is known from the beginning, and García Márquez constantly uses images which foreshadow this ending. For instance, a clock stuck at seven minutes past one, the exact time of the General's death, appears repeatedly in the novel. This sense of fate is introduced in the <a href="epigraph%20%28literature%29">epigraph</a>, which comes from a letter written by the historical Bolívar to General <a href="Francisco%20de%20Paula%20Santander">Santander</a> on August 4, 1823: "It seems that the devil controls the business of my life." As Palencia-Roth points out, the word used for devil here is rather than the more familiar . derives from the Greek word <a href="demon"></a>, which can equally mean divine power, fate, or destiny. Accordingly, the General succumbs to his fate and accepts his death as destiny.

The theme of love is central to the novel. Bolívar had a reputation as a womanizer, and books have been written on his philandering; but as depicted in this novel, during the last seven months of his life, the General could no longer engage in the activities that had fueled that reputation. García Márquez mentions a woman every few pages, many of whom are his own invention, exploring love through the General's memories. Palencia-Roth notes that the presence of these women "allows a labyrinthine exploration of his life before his final journey" and suggests that García Márquez uses love as a barometer of the General's heart and health. Although Bolívar is usually thought to have died from <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, Palencia-Roth believes that for the author, the General dies from the lack of love. "Despised by many of his countrymen, abandoned by all but a few aides and associates, left—during the final seven months of his life—without even the companionship of his longtime mistress <a href="Manuela%20Saenz">Manuela Saenz</a>, Bolívar had no choice but to die of a broken heart."

Numbers are an important symbolic aspect of the novel. The book is divided into eight chapters, almost all of equal length, which represent the eight-year love affair between the General and Manuela Sáenz. The General's last hours are marked by an octagonal clock. Allusions to the number three are even more common in the novel. As García Márquez scholar Isabel Rodríguez Vergara notes, the number three—the <a href="Trinity">Trinity</a> which occupies a vital place in the symbology of the Catholic Mass—is repeated 21 times throughout the book. She quotes Mircea Eliade: "In the novel it represents a symbolic sacrifice aimed at redeeming humankind—that of Bolívar, a misunderstood redeemer sacrificed by his own people."

Rodríguez Vergara observes that the General is like a supernatural being, simultaneously dying and being surrounded by symbolic circumstances such as rain, fiestas, and the plague. The novel begins with Bolívar immersed in purifying waters, in a state of ecstasy and meditation that suggests a priestly ritual. One of the women with whom the General sleeps, Queen Marie Louise, is described as a virgin with the profile of an idol—an allusion to the <a href="Virgin%20Mary">Virgin Mary</a>. The General rides a mule into the last towns on his journey towards death, echoing Christ's entry into Jerusalem. He dies of mysterious and unknown causes, and the people burn his belongings in fear of catching his illness. In Rodríguez Vergara's view, "Bolívar was sacrificed as a scapegoat to purge the guilt of the community."

René Girard has interpreted the recurrence of rain in the novel as one of the purifying rituals the community must undergo in order to wash away the contagion of violence. The fiestas may represent another ritual of purification and also symbolize war. Fiestas are held to honour the General when he arrives at a town, but at other times, political demonstrations against the General are mistaken for a fiesta. According to Rodríguez Vergara, this shows how "information is manipulated" and "depicts an atmosphere where fiesta and war are synonymous".

Latin American cultural theorist Carlos J. Alonso, drawing on <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Freudian</a> theory, argues that the novel is essentially a therapeutic device, designed to help move Latin America past its problematic experience of modernity. He compares this to the way the healing state of mourning replaces grief in the process of recovering from a death. Both activities are mechanisms for dealing with loss. Alonso believes that "The General in his Labyrinth", by almost entirely centering the novel on the General's death, forces the reader to confront the horror of this process. In Alonso's view, the reader is meant to pass from "a melancholy relationship vis-a-vis the figure of Bolívar to a relationship that has the therapeutic qualities of mourning instead".

Latin America's history and culture, Alonso suggests, began with the loss of Bolívar's dream of a united continent and as a result has developed under a melancholy shadow ever since. Thus, by forcing the reader to return to the origin of modernity in Latin America and confront its death in the most horrific way, García Márquez compels the reader to move from melancholy to mourning, "so that the phantom of the lost object of modernity may cease to rule the libidinal economy of Spanish American cultural discourse and historical life".

García Márquez comments on the nature of historical fact by drawing attention to the way history is written. The novel recreates a time in Bolívar's life that has no historical precedent, as there is no record of the last 14 days of his life. In García Márquez's account readers observe Bolívar intimately, seeing his human qualities. In the view of critic Isabel Alvarez Borland, by choosing to fictionalize a national hero in this way, García Márquez is challenging the claim of official history to represent the truth. In the "My Thanks" section of the novel, García Márquez asserts ironically that what he is writing is more historical than fictional, and he discusses his own historical methodology in detail. By posing in the role of a historian, he challenges the reliability of <a href="recorded%20history">written history</a> from within the writing process. According to Alvarez Borland, this serves to "remind us that a claim to truth is not the property of any text; rather it is the result of how a historian (as a reader) interprets the facts".

"The General in His Labyrinth" also confronts the methods of official historians by using an oral style of narration. The narration can be considered an oral account in that it is woven from the verbal interactions of everyday people. Alvarez Borland explains that the advantage of this technique, as discussed by Walter Ong, is that "the orality of any given culture, residing in the unwritten tales of its peoples, possesses a spontaneity and liveliness which is lost once this culture commits its tales to writing." The oral style of narration therefore provides a truthfulness which official history lacks. Alvarez Borland concludes that "The General in His Labyrinth" suggests new ways of writing the past; it takes account of voices that were never written down as part of official history.

The historian Ben Hughes commented on the novel: "The Liberator's British confidants, including Daniel O'Leary, were amongst the closest figures to the general in this period. Nevertheless, they are ignored in the novel. Instead, Márquez uses the character of a fictional Colombian servant, José Palacios, as The Liberator's final sounding board, thereby neatly sidestepping the more complex reality." In Hughes's view modern South American literature has played a role in cleansing the <a href="national%20memory">national memory</a> of British soldiers' assistance to The Liberator.

In an interview published in the Colombian weekly on March 20, 1989, García Márquez told María Elvira Samper, "At bottom, I have written only one book, the same one that circles round and round, and continues on." Palencia-Roth suggests that this novel is a "labyrinthine summation ... of García Márquez's long-standing obsessions and ever-present topics: love, death, solitude, power, fate".

Like the Patriarch in García Márquez's "<a href="The%20Autumn%20of%20the%20Patriarch">The Autumn of the Patriarch</a>", Bolívar was an absolute dictator. The Patriarch is never identified by name; Bolívar, too, is identified chiefly by his title. Bolívar also invites comparison with Colonel Aureliano Buendía in "<a href="One%20Hundred%20Years%20of%20Solitude">One Hundred Years of Solitude</a>": both characters believe the wars they have waged have been fruitless and overwhelming, and both face numerous attempts on their lives, but eventually die of natural causes. In his belief that life is controlled by fate, the General resembles Buendía in "One Hundred Years of Solitude" and Santiago Nasar in "<a href="Chronicle%20of%20a%20Death%20Foretold">Chronicle of a Death Foretold</a>".

Palencia-Roth notes that critics have been struck by the humorless elegiac style of "The General in His Labyrinth"; its dark mood and somber message is similar to that of "The Autumn of the Patriarch". Love is a theme common to both "Love in the Time of Cholera" and "The General in His Labyrinth", but the latter is considered a tragedy. These two novels have been used to demonstrate the range of García Márquez's work.

Isabel Alvarez Borland, in her essay "The Task of the Historian in ", claims that " ... while is in many ways a continuation of García Márquez's criticism of Latin America's official history seen in his earlier works, the novel contrasts sharply with his previous fictions". In "Chronicle of a Death Foretold", according to Alvarez Borland, the narrator challenges the truth of official language. However, "The General in His Labyrinth" "differs from these earlier works in employing narrative strategies which seek to answer in a much more overt and didactic fashion questions that the novel poses about history".

In a summary of Edward Hood's book , García Márquez is characterized as an author who uses repetition and (intertextuality between the works of a single author) extensively in his fiction, including in "The General in His Labyrinth". Hood points out some obvious examples of repetition in García Márquez's works: the themes of solitude in "One Hundred Years of Solitude", tyranny in "Autumn of the Patriarch", and the desire for a unified continent expressed by Bolívar in "The General in His Labyrinth". An example of intertextuality can be seen in the repetition of patterns between books. For example, both Jose Arcadio Buendia in "One Hundred Years of Solitude" and Bolívar in "The General in his Labyrinth" experience labyrinthian dreams.

Critics consider García Márquez's book in terms of the <a href="historical%20novel">historical novel</a>, but differ over whether the label is appropriate. In his review of "The General in his Labyrinth", Selden Rodman hesitated to call it a novel, since it was so heavily researched, giving Bolívar's views "on everything from life and love to his chronic constipation and dislike of tobacco smoke". On the other hand, reviewer Robert Adams suggested that García Márquez had "improved on history". According to critic Donald L. Shaw, "The General in His Labyrinth" is a "New Historical Novel", a genre that he argues crosses between <a href="Latin%20American%20Boom">Boom</a>, Post-Boom, and <a href="Postmodernist">Postmodernist</a> fiction in <a href="Latin%20American%20literature">Latin American literature</a>: "New Historical Novels tend either to retell historical events from an unconventional perspective, but one which preserves their intelligibility, or to question the very possibility of making sense of the past at all." Shaw believes that this novel belongs to the first category. García Márquez is presenting both a historical account and his own interpretation of events.

David Bushnell, writing in "The Hispanic American Historical Review", points out that the work is less a pure historical account than others suggest. García Márquez's Bolívar is a man "who wanders naked through the house, suffers constipation, uses foul language, and much more besides." He argues that documentation does not support many of these details. Bushnell suggests, however, that the fact that the novel is not entirely historically accurate does not necessarily distinguish it from the work of professional historians. The main difference, Bushnell believes, is that García Márquez's work "is far more readable" than a pure history.

"The General in His Labyrinth" was relatively poorly received by the general public in the United States, despite the praise of critics. Critic <a href="Ilan%20Stavans">Ilan Stavans</a>, who himself praised the book as "one of the writer's most sophisticated and accomplished", attributes this to the novel's time period and to its profusion of historical information, neither of which proved attractive to English-speaking readers. Isabel Alvarez Borland notes that, like Stavans, "critics in the United States have largely celebrated García Márquez's portrait of this national hero and considered it a tour de force"; but she also observes that in Latin America the book received more mixed reviews, ranging from "outrage to unqualified praise".

The novel generated huge controversy in Latin America: some Venezuelan and Colombian politicians described its depiction of Bolívar as "profane". According to Stavans, they accused García Márquez of "defaming the larger-than-life reputation of a historical figure who, during the nineteenth century, struggled to unite the vast Hispanic world". The novel's publication provoked outrage from many Latin American politicians and intellectuals because its portrayal of the General is not the saintly image long cherished by many. Mexico's ambassador to Austria, Francisco Cuevas Cancino, wrote a damning letter, which was widely publicized in Mexico City, objecting to the portrayal of Bolívar. He stated: "The novel is plagued with errors of fact, conception, fairness, understanding of the <a href="historical">historical</a> moment and ignorance of its consequences ... It has served the enemies of Latin America, who care only that they can now denigrate Bolívar, and with him all of us." Even the novel's admirers, such as the leading Venezuelan diplomat and writer <a href="Arturo%20Uslar%20Pietri">Arturo Uslar Pietri</a>, worried that some facts were stretched. García Márquez believes, however, that Latin America has to discover the General's labyrinth to recognize and deal with its own maze of problems.

More positively, <a href="Nelson%20Bocaranda">Nelson Bocaranda</a>, a Venezuelan TV commentator, considers the novel to be a tonic for Latin American culture: "people here saw a Bolívar who is a man of flesh and bones just like themselves". Mexican author <a href="Carlos%20Fuentes">Carlos Fuentes</a> agrees with Bocaranda saying: "What comes across beautifully and poignantly in this book is a man dealing with the unknown <a href="world%20of%20democratic%20ideas">world of democratic ideas</a>". García Márquez realistically portrays a ridiculous figure trapped in a labyrinth, magnifying the General's defects, and presenting an image of Bolívar contrary to that instilled in classrooms. However, the novel also depicts Bolívar as an idealist and political theorist who predicted many problems that would obstruct Latin American advancement in the future. García Márquez depicts a figure who was aware of the racial and social friction in Latin American society, feared debt, and warned against economic irresponsibility. He has the General warn his aide-de-camp, <a href="Agust%C3%ADn%20Jer%C3%B3nimo%20de%20Iturbide%20y%20Huarte">Agustín de Iturbide</a>, against the future interference of the United States in the internal affairs of Latin America.

Novelist and critic <a href="Barbara%20Mujica%20%28writer%29">Barbara Mujica</a> comments that the book's English translator, <a href="Edith%20Grossman">Edith Grossman</a>, fully captures the multiple levels of meaning of the text, as well as García Márquez's modulations in tone. García Márquez himself has admitted that he prefers his novels in their English translations.

The original Spanish version of "The General in His Labyrinth" was published simultaneously in Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, and Spain in 1989. The first American edition was listed as a best seller in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" the following year.

The novel has been translated into many languages since its first publication in Spanish, as detailed by Sfeir de González in 2003.

Night of January 16th

Night of January 16th is a <a href="Theater%20of%20the%20United%20States">theatrical play</a> by Russian-American author <a href="Ayn%20Rand">Ayn Rand</a>, inspired by the death of the "Match King", <a href="Ivar%20Kreuger">Ivar Kreuger</a>. Set <a href="legal%20drama">in a courtroom</a> during a murder trial, an unusual feature of the play is that <a href="interactive%20theatre">members of the audience</a> are chosen to play the jury. The court hears the case of Karen Andre, a former secretary and lover of businessman Bjorn Faulkner, of whose murder she is accused. The play does not directly portray the events leading to Faulkner's death; instead the jury must rely on character testimony to decide whether Andre is guilty. The play's ending depends on the verdict. Rand's intention was to dramatize a conflict between <a href="individualism">individualism</a> and <a href="conformity">conformity</a>, with the jury's verdict revealing which viewpoint they preferred.

The play was first produced in 1934 in Los Angeles under the title Woman on Trial; it received positive reviews and enjoyed moderate commercial success. Producer <a href="Albert%20H.%20Woods">Al Woods</a> took it to <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> during the 1935–36 season and re-titled it "Night of January 16th". It drew attention for its innovative audience-member jury and became a hit, running for seven months. <a href="Doris%20Nolan">Doris Nolan</a>, in her Broadway debut, received positive criticism for her portrayal of the lead role. Several <a href="Regional%20theater%20in%20the%20United%20States">regional productions</a> followed. An <a href="off-Broadway">off-Broadway</a> revival in 1973, under the title Penthouse Legend, was a commercial and critical failure. A <a href="The%20Night%20of%20January%2016th%20%28film%29">film based on the play</a> was released in 1941; the story has also been adapted for television and <a href="radio%20drama">radio</a>.

Rand had many heated disputes with Woods over script changes he wanted for the Broadway production. Their disputes climaxed in an <a href="Arbitration%20in%20the%20United%20States">arbitration</a> hearing when Rand discovered Woods had diverted a portion of her <a href="royalty%20payment">royalties</a> to pay for a <a href="script%20doctor">script doctor</a>. Rand disliked the changes made for the Broadway production and the version published for <a href="Amateur%20theatre">amateur</a> productions, so in 1968 she re-edited the script for publication as the "definitive" version.

Rand drew inspiration for "Night of January 16th" from two sources. The first was "<a href="The%20Trial%20of%20Mary%20Dugan">The Trial of Mary Dugan</a>", a 1927 <a href="melodrama">melodrama</a> about a showgirl prosecuted for killing her wealthy lover, which gave Rand the idea to write a play featuring a trial. Rand wanted her play's ending to depend on the result of the trial, rather than having a fixed final scene. She based her victim on <a href="Ivar%20Kreuger">Ivar Kreuger</a>, a Swedish businessman known as the "Match King" for the matchstick-manufacturing monopolies he owned, before he was found dead in March 1932. When Kreuger's business empire became financially unstable, he shot himself after being accused of executing underhanded and possibly illegal financial deals. This incident inspired Rand to make the victim a businessman of great ambition and dubious character, who had given several people motives for his murder.

Rand wrote "Night of January 16th" in 1933. She was 28 and had been in the United States for seven years after emigrating from the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, where her strong <a href="anti-communism">anti-Communist</a> opinions had put her at risk. Rand had never written a stage play, but had worked in Hollywood as a junior screenwriter for <a href="Cecil%20B.%20DeMille">Cecil B. DeMille</a>, and later in <a href="RKO%20Pictures">RKO Studios</a>' wardrobe department. In September 1932, Rand sold an original screenplay, "<a href="Red%20Pawn">Red Pawn</a>", to <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal Studios</a> and quit RKO to finish her first novel, "<a href="We%20the%20Living">We the Living</a>". She wrote the stage play with the hope of making money from it while finishing her novel. By 1934 her agent was trying to sell the play and the novel, but both were repeatedly rejected. "Red Pawn" was shelved and Rand's contract for rewrites on it expired. Rand's husband, actor Frank O'Connor, was getting only minor roles with little pay, leaving the couple in financial difficulties. With the last of her money from "Red Pawn" exhausted, Rand got an offer for her new play from <a href="Albert%20H.%20Woods">Al Woods</a>, who had produced "The Trial of Mary Dugan" for Broadway. The contract included a condition that Woods could make changes to the script. Wary that he would destroy her vision of the play to create a more conventional drama, Rand turned Woods down.
Soon after she rejected the offer from Woods, Rand accepted an offer from Welsh actor <a href="E.%20E.%20Clive">E. E. Clive</a> to stage the play in Los Angeles. It first opened at the <a href="Avalon%20Hollywood">Hollywood Playhouse</a> as "Woman on Trial"; Clive produced, and <a href="Barbara%20Bedford%20%28actress%29">Barbara Bedford</a> played Andre. The production opened on October 22, 1934, and closed in late November.

At the end of the play's run in Los Angeles, Woods renewed his offer to produce the play on Broadway. Although he was a renowned producer of many famous plays in a career of more than three decades, Woods had lost much of his fortune in the early 1930s and had not produced a hit in several years. Being refused by a neophyte author shocked him and increased his interest. Woods still wanted the right to make script changes, but he made adjustments to the contract to give Rand more influence. She reluctantly agreed to his terms.

Rand arrived in New York City at the beginning of December 1934 in anticipation of the opening in January. The play's financing failed, delaying the production for several months until Woods arranged new financing from theater owner <a href="Lee%20Shubert">Lee Shubert</a>. When work resumed, Rand's relationship with Woods quickly soured as he demanded changes she later derided as "a junk heap of worn, irrelevant melodramatic devices". Woods had made his success on Broadway with low-brow melodramas such as "<a href="Nellie%2C%20the%20Beautiful%20Cloak%20Model">Nellie, the Beautiful Cloak Model</a>" and risqué comedies such as "<a href="The%20Demi-Virgin">The Demi-Virgin</a>". Woods was not interested in what he called Rand's "highfalutin speeches", preferring the dramatic conflict to focus on concrete elements, such as whether the defendant had a gun. The changes to Rand's work included the creation of a new character, a <a href="gun%20moll">gun moll</a> played by Shubert's mistress.

The contract between Woods and Rand allowed him to hire collaborators if he thought it necessary, paying them a limited portion of the author's royalties. He first hired John Hayden to direct, paying him one percentage point from Rand's 10-percent royalty. Although Hayden was a successful Broadway director, Rand disliked him and later called him "a very ratty Broadway hanger-on". As auditions for the play began in Philadelphia, Woods demanded further script changes and was frustrated by Rand's refusal to make some of them. He engaged <a href="Louis%20Weitzenkorn">Louis Weitzenkorn</a>, the author of the previous hit "<a href="Five%20Star%20Final%20%28play%29">Five Star Final</a>", to act as a <a href="script%20doctor">script doctor</a>. Rand's relationship with Weitzenkorn was worse than hers with Woods or Hayden; she and Weitzenkorn argued over political differences as well as his ideas for the play. Woods gave Weitzenkorn another percentage point from Rand's royalties without informing her. Rand filed a claim against Woods with the <a href="American%20Arbitration%20Association">American Arbitration Association</a>; she objected to Weitzenkorn receiving any portion of her royalties, and told the arbitration panel Weitzenkorn had added only a single line to the play, which was cut after the auditions. Upon hearing this testimony, one of the arbitrators responded incredulously, "That was he did?" In two hearings, the panel ruled that Weitzenkorn should receive his agreed-upon one percent, but that Woods could not deduct the payment from Rand's royalties because she had not been notified in advance. Despite the disputes between Rand and Woods, the play opened at Shubert's <a href="Ambassador%20Theatre%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Ambassador Theatre</a> on September 16, 1935, where it ran successfully for seven months. It closed on April 4, 1936, after 283 performances.

When the play's success on Broadway was clear, Woods launched productions of the play in other cities, starting with San Francisco. It opened there at the <a href="Geary%20Theater">Geary Theater</a> on December 30, 1935, and ran for five weeks with <a href="Nedda%20Harrigan">Nedda Harrigan</a> in the lead role. Harrigan stayed with the show when it moved to the <a href="El%20Capitan%20Theatre">El Capitan Theatre</a> in Los Angeles, where it opened on March 1, 1936. After the Broadway production closed, Woods started a road tour that included productions in Boston and Chicago.

International productions of the play included shows in London, Montreal, and Sydney. The production in London opened on September 29, 1936, where <a href="Phoebe%20Foster">Phoebe Foster</a> took the lead role for her first appearance on the London stage. It closed after 22 performances. A production in Montreal opened on June 16, 1941, starring <a href="Fay%20Wray">Fay Wray</a> as Andre and <a href="Robert%20Wilcox%20%28actor%29">Robert Wilcox</a> as Regan. In Sydney, the play opened at the <a href="Minerva%20Theatre%2C%20Sydney">Minerva Theatre</a> on June 19, 1944, with <a href="Thelma%20Grigg">Thelma Grigg</a> as Andre.

"Night of January 16th" was first published in an edition for amateur theater organizations in 1936, using a version edited by drama professor Nathaniel Edward , which included further changes to eliminate elements such as swearing and smoking. Rand disavowed this version because of the changes. In 1960, Rand's protégé <a href="Nathaniel%20Branden">Nathaniel Branden</a> asked about doing a public reading of the play for students at the <a href="Nathaniel%20Branden%20Institute">Nathaniel Branden Institute</a>. Rand did not want him to use the amateur version; she created a revised text that eliminated most of Woods' and 's changes. She had her "final, definitive version" published in 1968 with an introduction about the play's history.

In 1972, Rand approved an off-Broadway revival of the play, which used her preferred version of the script, including several dozen further small changes in language beyond those in the 1968 version. The revival also used her original title, "Penthouse Legend". It was produced by Phillip and <a href="Kay%20Nolte%20Smith">Kay Nolte Smith</a>, a married couple who were friends with Rand. Kay Smith also starred in the production under the stage name Kay Gillian. It opened at the <a href="McAlpin%20Rooftop%20Theater">McAlpin Rooftop Theater</a> on February 22, 1973, and closed on March 18 after 30 performances.

"Night of January 16th" was the last theatrical success for either Rand or Woods. Rand's next play, "<a href="Ideal%20%28play%29">Ideal</a>", went unsold, and a <a href="The%20Unconquered%20%281940%20play%29">1940 stage adaptation</a> of "We the Living" flopped. Rand achieved lasting success and financial stability with her 1943 novel, "<a href="The%20Fountainhead">The Fountainhead</a>". Woods produced several more plays; none were hits and when he died in 1951, he was bankrupt and living in a hotel.

The plot of "Night of January 16th" centers on the trial of secretary Karen Andre for the murder of her employer, business executive Bjorn Faulkner, who defrauded his company of millions of dollars to invest in the gold trade. In the wake of a financial crash, he was facing bankruptcy. The play's events occur entirely in a courtroom; Faulkner is never seen. On the night of January 16, Faulkner and Andre were in the penthouse of the Faulkner Building in New York City, when Faulkner apparently fell to his death. Within the three <a href="Act%20%28drama%29">acts</a>, the prosecutor Mr. Flint and Andre's defense attorney Mr. Stevens call witnesses whose testimonies build conflicting stories.

At the beginning of the first act, the judge asks the court clerk to call jurors from the audience. Once the jurors are seated, the prosecution argument begins. Flint explains that Andre was not just Faulkner's secretary, but also his lover. He says Faulkner jilted her to marry Nancy Lee Whitfield and fired Andre, motivating Andre to murder him. Flint then calls a series of witnesses, starting with the medical examiner, who testifies that Faulkner's body was so damaged by the fall that it was impossible to determine whether he was killed by the impact or was already dead. An elderly night watchman and a private investigator describe the events they saw that evening. A police inspector testifies to finding a suicide note. Faulkner's very religious housekeeper disapprovingly describes the sexual relationship between Andre and Faulkner, and says she saw Andre with another man after Faulkner's marriage. Nancy Lee testifies about her and Faulkner's courtship and marriage, portraying both as idyllic. The act ends with Andre speaking out of turn to accuse Nancy Lee of lying.
The second act continues the prosecution's case, with Flint calling John Graham Whitfield—Faulkner's father-in-law and president of Whitfield National Bank. He testifies about a large loan he made to Faulkner. In his <a href="cross-examination">cross-examination</a>, defense attorney Stevens suggests the loan was used to buy Faulkner's marriage to Whitfield's daughter. After this testimony, the prosecution rests and the defense argument begins. A handwriting expert testifies about the signature on the suicide note. Faulkner's bookkeeper describes events between Andre's dismissal and the night of Faulkner's death, and related financial matters. Andre takes the stand and describes her relationship with Faulkner as both his lover and his partner in financial fraud. She says she did not resent his marriage because it was a business deal to secure credit from the Whitfield Bank. As she starts to explain the reasons for Faulkner's alleged suicide, she is interrupted by the arrival of "Guts" Regan, an infamous gangster, who tells Andre that Faulkner is dead. Despite being on trial for Faulkner's murder, Andre is shocked by this news and faints.

The final act continues Andre's testimony; she is now somber rather than defiant. She says that she, Faulkner, and Regan had conspired to fake Faulkner's suicide so they could escape with money stolen from Whitfield. Regan, who was also in love with Andre, provided the stolen body of his already-dead gang associate, "Lefty" O'Toole, to throw from the building. In cross-examination, Flint suggests Andre and Regan were using knowledge of past criminal activities to blackmail Faulkner. Stevens then calls Regan, who testifies that he was due to meet Faulkner at a getaway plane after leaving the stolen body with Andre; however, Faulkner did not arrive and the plane was missing. Instead of Faulkner, Regan encountered Whitfield, who gave him a check that was, according to Regan, to buy his silence. Regan later found the missing plane, which had been burned with what he presumes is Faulkner's body inside. Flint's cross-examination offers an alternative theory: Regan put the stolen body into the plane to create doubt about Andre's guilt, and the check from Whitfield was protection money to Regan's gang. In the play's Broadway and amateur versions, the next witness is Roberta Van Rensselaer, an exotic dancer and wife of O'Toole, who believes Regan killed her husband. This character does not appear in Rand's preferred version of the play. Stevens then recalls two witnesses to follow up on issues from Regan's testimony. The defense and prosecution then give their closing arguments.

The jury retires to vote while the characters repeat highlights from their testimony under a spotlight. The jury then returns to announce its verdict. One of two short endings follows. If found not guilty, Andre thanks the jury. If found guilty, she says the jury have spared her from committing suicide. In Reeid's amateur version, after either verdict the judge berates the jurors for their bad judgment and declares that they cannot serve on a jury again.

Although best known as "Night of January 16th", the play's title changed multiple times and several alternative titles were considered. Rand's working title was "Penthouse Legend". When Clive picked up the play, he thought Rand's title suggested a fantasy story that would discourage potential patrons. The play was called "The Verdict" during the Hollywood Playhouse rehearsals, but opened there with the title "Woman on Trial". When Woods took the play to Broadway, he insisted on a new title. He offered Rand a choice between "The Black Sedan" and "Night of January 16th". Rand liked neither, but picked the latter. Woods later suggested two more name changes, but did not implement them. Prior to the opening, he considered renaming the play "The Night is Young". After the play opened, he considered changing its name each day to match the current date.

When Rand published her version of the play in 1968, she wrote that although she disliked the Broadway title, it was too well known to change it again. She agreed to using "Penthouse Legend" as the title for the 1973 revival production.

The play's protagonist and lead female role is the defendant, Karen Andre. Woods considered several actresses for the role, but with Rand's support he cast an unusual choice, an actress named <a href="Doris%20Nolan">Doris Nolan</a>. It was Nolan's Broadway debut; her previous professional acting experience was a failed attempt at completing a movie scene. At 17 years old, she was cast as a presumably older <a href="femme%20fatale">femme fatale</a>. Woods was Nolan's manager and got a commission from her contract. Nolan was inexperienced and was nervous throughout rehearsals. When other actresses visited, she feared they were there to replace her. Although Rand later said she was "not a sensational actress", reviewers praised her performance. Nolan left the cast in March to take a movie contract from <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal Studios</a>.

Rand actively pushed for <a href="Walter%20Pidgeon">Walter Pidgeon</a> to be cast in the role of "Guts" Regan. Woods objected at first, but eventually gave Pidgeon the part. As with Nolan, reviewers approved the choice. Pidgeon left the production after about a month to take a role in another play, "<a href="There%27s%20Wisdom%20in%20Women">There's Wisdom in Women</a>". Despite Rand's objections, he was replaced with <a href="William%20Bakewell">William Bakewell</a>; Rand recommended <a href="Morgan%20Conway">Morgan Conway</a>, who played the same role in "Woman on Trial".

The selection of a jury from the play's audience was the primary dramatic innovation of "Night of January 16th". It created concerns among many of the producers who considered and rejected the play. Although Woods liked the idea, Hayden worried it would destroy the theatrical illusion; he feared audience members might refuse to participate. Successful jury selections during <a href="Preview%20%28theatre%29">previews</a> indicated this would not be a problem. This criticism dissipated following the play's success; it became famous for its "jury gimmick".

The play's jury has sometimes enlisted famous participants; the Broadway selections were rigged to call on celebrities known to be in the audience. The jury for the Broadway opening included attorney Edward J. Reilly—who was known from the <a href="Lindbergh%20kidnapping">Lindbergh kidnapping</a> trial earlier that year—and boxing champion <a href="Jack%20Dempsey">Jack Dempsey</a>. At a special performance for the blind, <a href="Helen%20Keller">Helen Keller</a> sat on the jury. The practice of using celebrity jurors continued throughout the Broadway run and in other productions.

Woods decided the jury for the Broadway run would employ some jury service rules of the <a href="New%20York%20Supreme%20Court">New York courts</a>. One such rule was the payment of jurors three dollars per day for their participation, which meant the selected audience members profited by at least 25 cents after subtracting the ticket price. Another was that only men could serve on a jury, although Woods made exceptions, for example at the performance Keller attended. He later loosened the rule to allow women jurors at matinee performances twice a week. Unlike a normal criminal trial, verdicts required only a majority vote rather than unanimity.

Rand described "Night of January 16th" as "a sense-of-life play". She did not want its events to be taken literally, but to be understood as a representation of different ways of approaching life. Andre represents an ambitious, confident, non-conformist approach to life, while the prosecution witnesses represent conformity, envy of success, and the desire for power over others. Rand believed the jury's decision at each performance revealed the attitude of the jurors towards these two conflicting senses of life. Rand supported individualism and considered Andre "not guilty". She said she wanted the play to convey the viewpoint: "Your life, your achievement, your happiness, are of paramount importance. Live up to your highest vision of yourself no matter what the circumstances you might encounter. An exalted view of self-esteem is man's most admirable quality". She said the play "is not a philosophical treatise on morality" and represents this view only in a basic way. Rand would later expound an explicit philosophy, which she called "<a href="Objectivism%20%28Ayn%20Rand%29">Objectivism</a>", particularly in her 1957 novel "<a href="Atlas%20Shrugged">Atlas Shrugged</a>" and in non-fiction essays, but "Night of January 16th" predates these more philosophical works.

Several later commentators have interpreted the play as a reflection of Rand's early interest in the ideas of German philosopher <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>. Literature professor Shoshana Milgram saw elements of Nietzsche's morality in the descriptions of Bjorn Faulkner, who "never thought of things as right or wrong". Others found significance in Rand's admiration of the play's criminal characters. Historian Jennifer Burns said Rand "found criminality an irresistible metaphor for individualism" because of the influence on her of "Nietzsche's transvaluation of values [that] changed criminals into heroes". Rand maintained criminality was not the important attribute of the characters; she said a criminal could serve as "an eloquent symbol" of independence and rebellion against conformity, but stated, "I do not think, nor did I think when I wrote this play, that a swindler is a heroic character or that a respectable banker is a villain". Rand biographer Ronald Merrill dismissed this explanation as a cover-up for the play's promotion of Nietzschean ideas that Rand later rejected. He called the play "a powerful and eloquent plea for the Nietzschean worldview" of the superiority of the "<a href="%C3%9Cbermensch">superman</a>"; this is represented by Faulkner, whom Merrill interprets as rejecting external moral authority and the "<a href="slave%20morality">slave morality</a>" of ordinary people. Biographer Anne Heller said Rand "later renounced her romantic fascination with criminals", making the characters' criminality an embarrassment for her.

Since its premiere, "Night of January 16th" has had a mixed reception. The initial Los Angeles run as "Woman on Trial" received complimentary reviews; Rand was disappointed that reviews focused on the play's melodrama and its similarity to "The Trial of Mary Dugan", while paying little attention to aspects she considered more important, such as the contrasting ideas of individualism and conformity. Although Rand later described the production as "badly handicapped by lack of funds" and "competent, but somewhat unexciting", it performed reasonably well at the box office during its short run.

The Broadway production received largely positive reviews that praised its melodrama and the acting of Nolan and Pidgeon. "<a href="Commonweal%20%28magazine%29">Commonweal</a>" described it as "well constructed, well enough written, admirably directed ... and excellently acted". The "<a href="Brooklyn%20Daily%20Eagle">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</a>" said the action came in "fits and starts", but praised the acting and the novelty of the use of a jury. "<a href="New%20York%20Post">New York Post</a>" critic <a href="John%20Mason%20Brown">John Mason Brown</a> said the play had some flaws, but was an exciting, above-average melodrama. <a href="Brooks%20Atkinson">Brooks Atkinson</a> gave it a negative review in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", calling it "the usual brew of hokum". A review from "<a href="Theatre%20Arts%20Monthly">Theatre Arts Monthly</a>" was also dismissive, calling the play a "fashionable game" that would be "fun in a parlor" but seemed "pretty foolish" on stage. Some reviews focused on Woods as the source of the play's positive attributes because he had had many previous theatrical successes. "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" said Woods was repeating a successful formula from "The Trial of Mary Dugan". Reviews that praised these elements were an embarrassment to Rand, who considered Woods' changes to be negative. Again, reviewers ignored the broader themes that Rand considered important.

Professional productions in other North American cities typically received positive reviews. Austin B. Fenger described the production at San Francisco's <a href="Geary%20Theater">Geary Theater</a> as "darned good theater" that was "well acted" and "crisply written". Charles Collins said the Chicago production was "a first class story" that was "well acted by an admirably selected cast". Thomas Archer's review of the Montreal production described it as "realistic" and "absorbing".

The London production in 1936 received mostly positive reviews but was not a commercial success. A reviewer for "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" praised Foster's performance as "tense and beautiful". In "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>", reviewer <a href="W.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BA.%20Darlington">W. A. Darlington</a> said the show would be popular with audiences, but the production ended its run in less than a month. The review in "<a href="The%20Glasgow%20Herald">The Glasgow Herald</a>" described it as a "strong, quick thriller", but with inferior dialog to "The Trial of Mary Dugan". The reviewer for "<a href="The%20Spectator">The Spectator</a>" was more critical, saying the play itself was "strong", but was undermined by "mediocre playing" from "bad actors".

The 1973 revival as "Penthouse Legend" was a failure and received strongly negative reviews. A reviewer for "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" complimented the story's melodramatic plot twists but said it was "preposterously badly written" and described the production as "conventional and obvious". In "The New York Times", <a href="Clive%20Barnes">Clive Barnes</a> called the play tedious and said the acting was "not particularly good". It closed within a few weeks.

Academics and biographers reviewing the play have also expressed mixed opinions. Theater scholar <a href="Gerald%20Bordman">Gerald Bordman</a> declared it "an unexceptional courtroom drama" made popular by the jury element, although he noted praise for the acting of Breese and Pidgeon. Historian James Baker described Rand's presentation of courtroom behavior as unrealistic, but said audiences forgive this because the play's dramatic moments are "so much fun". He said the play was "great entertainment" that is "held together by an enormously attractive woman and a gimmick", but "it is not philosophy" and fails to convey the themes Rand had in mind. Jennifer Burns expressed a similar view, stating that the play's attempts to portray individualism had "dubious results ... Rand intended Bjorn Faulkner to embody heroic individualism, but in the play he comes off as little more than an unscrupulous businessman with a taste for rough sex". Literature scholar <a href="Mimi%20Reisel%20Gladstein">Mimi Reisel Gladstein</a> described the play as "significant for dramatic ingenuity and thematic content". Rand biographer Anne Heller considered it "engaging, if stilted", while Ronald Merrill described it as "a skillfully constructed drama" undercut by "Rand's peculiar inability to write an effective mystery plot without leaving holes". Mystery critic Marvin Lachman noted the novelty of the use of a jury but called the play unrealistic with "stilted dialogue" and "stereotypical characters".

The movie rights to "Night of January 16th" were initially purchased by <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> (MGM) in October 1934 as a possible vehicle for <a href="Loretta%20Young">Loretta Young</a>. They hired Rand to write a screenplay, but the project was scrapped. After MGM's option expired, Woods considered making a movie version through a production company of his own, but in 1938 <a href="RKO%20Pictures">RKO Pictures</a> bought the rights for $10,000, a fee split between Woods and Rand. RKO considered <a href="Claudette%20Colbert">Claudette Colbert</a> and <a href="Lucille%20Ball">Lucille Ball</a> as possible stars, but they also gave up on the adaptation. The rights were resold to <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> in July 1939 for $35,000. Paramount released a movie in 1941; Rand did not participate in the production. The film was directed by <a href="William%20Clemens%20%28film%20director%29">William Clemens</a>, and <a href="Delmer%20Daves">Delmer Daves</a>, <a href="Robert%20Pirosh">Robert Pirosh</a>, and Eve Greene were engaged to prepare a new screenplay.

The new screenplay altered the plot significantly, focusing on Steve Van Ruyle (<a href="Robert%20Preston%20%28actor%29">Robert Preston</a>), a sailor who inherits a position on the board of a company headed by Bjorn Faulkner (<a href="Nils%20Asther">Nils Asther</a>). Unlike the play, in which Faulkner is already dead, he appears in the film as a living character who is apparently murdered. Suspicion falls on Faulkner's secretary Kit Lane (<a href="Ellen%20Drew">Ellen Drew</a>); Van Ruyle decides to investigate the alleged crime. Faulkner is discovered hiding in Cuba after faking his own death. Rand said only a single line from her original dialog appeared in the movie, which she dismissed as a "cheap, trashy vulgarity". The film received little attention when it was released, and most reviews of it were negative.

In 1989, "<a href="Gawaahi">Gawaahi</a>", a <a href="Hindi-language">Hindi-language</a> adaptation of "Night of January 16th" was released. Indian actress <a href="Zeenat%20Aman">Zeenat Aman</a> led a cast that included <a href="Shekhar%20Kapur">Shekhar Kapur</a> and <a href="Ashutosh%20Gowariker">Ashutosh Gowariker</a>.

"Night of January 16th" was adapted for several television <a href="anthology%20series">anthology series</a> in the 1950s and 1960s. The first was <a href="WOR-TV">WOR-TV</a>'s "<a href="Broadway%20Television%20Theatre">Broadway Television Theatre</a>", which aired its adaptation on July 14, 1952, with a cast that included <a href="Neil%20Hamilton%20%28actor%29">Neil Hamilton</a> and <a href="Virginia%20Gilmore">Virginia Gilmore</a>. On <a href="CBS">CBS</a>, the "<a href="Lux%20Video%20Theatre">Lux Video Theatre</a>" presented a version of "Night of January 16th" on May 10, 1956, starring <a href="Phyllis%20Thaxter">Phyllis Thaxter</a> as Andre.

HMS Tiger (1913)

HMS "Tiger" was a <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> and the eleventh ship to bear that name. She was built by <a href="John%20Brown%20and%20Company">John Brown and Company</a> of <a href="Clydebank">Clydebank</a>, <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, and launched in 1913. "Tiger" was the most heavily armoured battlecruiser of the Royal Navy at the start of the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>, but was not yet ready for service. The ship was assigned to the <a href="1st%20Battlecruiser%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">1st Battlecruiser Squadron</a> (1st BCS) for the duration of the war and participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dogger%20Bank%20%281915%29">Battle of Dogger Bank</a> in early 1915, though she was still <a href="Shakedown%20%28testing%29">shaking down</a> and did not perform well. "Tiger" next participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> in 1916, where she was only lightly damaged despite suffering many hits by German shells. Apart from providing distant cover during the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Heligoland%20Bight">Second Battle of Heligoland Bight</a> in 1917, she spent the rest of the war on uneventful patrols in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>.

"Tiger" was the oldest battlecruiser retained by the Royal Navy after the tonnage limits of the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a> came into effect in 1922. She became a gunnery training ship in 1924 and then joined the Battlecruiser Squadron in 1929 when its <a href="flagship">flagship</a>, , underwent a lengthy refit. Upon "Hood"s return to service in 1931, "Tiger" was <a href="Ship%20decommissioning">decommissioned</a> and sold for <a href="ship%20breaking">scrap</a> in 1932 in accordance with the terms of the <a href="London%20Naval%20Treaty">London Naval Treaty</a> of 1930.

In his book, "The Price of Admiralty", British military historian <a href="John%20Keegan">John Keegan</a> described her as "certainly the most beautiful warship in the world then, and perhaps ever[.]"

"Tiger" was the sole battlecruiser authorised in the 1911–12 Naval Programme. According to naval historian Siegfried Breyer, a sister ship named "Leopard" was considered in the 1912–13 Programme and deferred until 1914 as a sixth member of the , but there is no record of any additional battlecruiser being provided for in any naval estimates before 1914.

"Tiger" had an <a href="length%20overall">overall length</a> of , a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a mean <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draught</a> of at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>. She normally displaced and at deep load. Although "Tiger" was only longer and wider than the previous battlecruiser, , she displaced almost more than the older ship. She had a <a href="metacentric%20height">metacentric height</a> of at deep load. In September 1914, her complement consisted of 1,112 officers and <a href="naval%20rating">ratings</a>; in April 1918, they totalled 1,459.

"Tiger" had two paired sets of Brown-Curtis direct-drive <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s housed in separate engine-rooms. Each set consisted of high-pressure ahead and astern turbines driving an outboard shaft and low-pressure ahead and astern turbines, housed in the same casing, driving an inner shaft. Her three-bladed <a href="propeller">propeller</a>s were in diameter. The turbines were powered by 39 <a href="Babcock%20%26amp%3B%20Wilcox">Babcock & Wilcox</a> <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s in five boiler rooms at a working pressure of . The turbines were designed to produce a total of and a maximum of when forced, but only achieved during her <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s, although she managed to exceed her maximum designed speed of by over a knot.

The ship's fuel stowage capacity was of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> and of coal, giving a total fuel supply of —much more than "Queen Mary"s total of . The sole (unofficial) figure for "Tiger's" daily fuel consumption of a day at would have given a maximum endurance of . The equivalent figure for "Queen Mary" was roughly . Four <a href="direct%20current">direct current</a> electric <a href="dynamo">dynamo</a>s with a total capacity of supplied the common <a href="ring%20main">ring main</a> at 220 <a href="volt">volt</a>s.

"Tiger" mounted eight 45-<a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">calibre</a> <a href="BL%2013.5%20inch%20/45%20naval%20gun">BL 13.5-inch Mk V guns</a> in four twin hydraulically powered turrets, designated 'A', 'B', 'Q' and 'X' from front to rear. The guns could be depressed to −5° and elevated to +20°, although the directors controlling the turrets were limited to 15° 21' until superelevating prisms were installed before the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> in May 1916 to allow full elevation. They fired projectiles at a <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of ; at 20° elevation, this provided a maximum range of . The rate of fire of these guns was approximately 2 rounds per minute. The ship carried a total of 1040 rounds during wartime for 130 shells per gun.

Her secondary armament consisted of twelve <a href="BL%206%20inch%20Mk%20VII%20naval%20gun">BL 6-inch Mk VII guns</a> in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s. The guns could depress to −7° and had a maximum elevation of 14°. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of approximately ; this gave a maximum range of at +14° elevation. They were provided with 120 rounds per gun. The ship mounted a pair of <a href="QF%203%20inch%2020%20cwt">QF 3 inch 20 cwt</a> Mk I <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> guns on high-angle Mark II mounts. The gun had a maximum elevation of +90° and fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of . It had a maximum effective ceiling of . Originally "Tiger" carried 300 rounds per gun, but this was reduced during the war to 150 rounds per gun.

Four <a href="British%2021%20inch%20torpedo">21 inch (533 mm)</a> submerged <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s were fitted on the beam, one pair port and starboard forward of 'A' barbette and aft of 'X' barbette. The ship carried 20 Mark II*** torpedoes, each with a warhead of of <a href="Trinitrotoluene">TNT</a>. They had two speed settings which governed their range; at they could reach , or at .

The main guns of "Tiger" were controlled from either of the two <a href="Fire-control%20system%23Naval%20fire%20control">fire-control director</a>s. The primary director was in the <a href="Top%20%28sailing%20ship%29">fore-top</a> on the foremast and the other was mounted on the aft superstructure in the torpedo control tower. Data from <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a>s in the armoured hood above the <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> and in 'B' and 'Q' turrets was transmitted to the Mk IV <a href="Frederic%20Charles%20Dreyer%23Dreyer%20Fire%20Control%20Table">Dreyer Fire Control Table</a> located in the transmitting station below the <a href="waterline">waterline</a>. The observations were then plotted and converted into range and deflection data for use by the director and guns. A Mark VII* <a href="Dumaresq">Dumaresq</a> in the armoured tower was trained on the target to supply bearing data to one transmitting station for use in plotting and calculations, and a second station was fitted for the ship's secondary armament, although a pair of fire-control directors for those guns, one for each broadside, were not fitted until 1915.

Fire-control technology advanced quickly during the years immediately preceding the First World War and the development of the director firing system was a major advance. This consisted of a fire-control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided elevation and training angles to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crewmen had only to follow. The director layer fired the guns simultaneously by an electrical trigger which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells.

During the war "Tiger"s rangefinders had increased in number and in size. By the end of the war 'A' and 'Q' turrets mounted rangefinders while 'X' turret, the armoured hood above the conning tower (also known as the gun control tower), and the torpedo control tower had instruments. A rangefinder was fitted in the fore-top and three instruments were fitted on 'B' turret, the gun control tower and above the compass platform. A high-angle rangefinder was mounted above the roof of the fore-top for use by the anti-aircraft guns.

"Tiger"s armour protection was similar to that of "Queen Mary"; her waterline <a href="Belt%20armor">belt</a> of <a href="Krupp%20cemented%20armour">Krupp cemented armour</a> measured thick amidships. It thinned to four inches towards the ship's ends, but did not reach either the bow or the stern. The depth of the main belt below the waterline was reduced from , although a <a href="strake">strake</a> of three-inch armour tall was added below the main belt that stretched from the front of 'A' barbette to the rear of 'B' barbette. It was based on that used on the <a href="Vickers%20Shipbuilding%20and%20Engineering">Vickers</a> built Japanese battlecruiser , the only design influence on "Tiger" that can be attributed to that ship.

Like the ships and "Queen Mary", "Tiger" was given an upper armour belt with a maximum thickness of six inches over the same length as the thickest part of the waterline armour and thinned to abreast the end turrets. Unlike those ships, "Tiger" had an additional strake of 6-inch armour above the upper belt protecting her secondary armament. Four-inch transverse <a href="Bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkhead</a>s closed off the ends of the <a href="armoured%20citadel">armoured citadel</a>. High-tensile steel was used for the protective decks. They generally ranged from in thickness.

The gun turrets had 9-inch front and sides while their roofs were thick. The <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s were protected above the citadel by of armour, thinning to three to four inches inside the citadel. The main conning tower had a three-inch roof and sides thick. The walls of the <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23C">communication tube</a> were three to four inches thick. The aft conning tower had 6-inch walls and a 3-inch cast steel roof. High-tensile steel <a href="torpedo%20bulkhead">torpedo bulkhead</a>s thick were fitted abreast the <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a> and shell rooms. After the Battle of Jutland revealed the ship's vulnerability to plunging shellfire, around of additional armour was added to the turret roofs, the decks over the magazines, and the bulkheads separating the 6-inch guns.

"Tiger" was laid down at the <a href="John%20Brown%20and%20Company">John Brown and Company</a> shipyard in <a href="Clydebank">Clydebank</a> on 6 June 1912. She was launched on 15 December 1913 and commissioned into the Royal Navy on 3 October 1914, at the cost of £2,593,100, including armament. The ship was still under construction when the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a> broke out in August 1914. On 3 August 1914 Captain <a href="Henry%20Pelly">Henry Pelly</a> was appointed to command the incomplete ship. Beatty described Pelly at the time as "a very charming person and, what is more important just now, a very efficient officer".

"Tiger" was commissioned for the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron (1st BCS) on 3 October. After the <a href="Battle%20of%20Coronel">Battle of Coronel</a> and the deployment of three battlecruisers to hunt for the <a href="German%20East%20Asia%20Squadron">German East Asia Squadron</a>, Tiger was ordered to cut short her firing trials off Berehaven. Beatty described "Tiger" to the First Sea Lord, Admiral of the Fleet <a href="Jackie%20Fisher%2C%201st%20Baron%20Fisher">Lord Fisher of Kilverstone</a>, as "not yet fit to fight. Three out of her four dynamoes are out of action for an indefinite period, and her training is impeded by bad weather, which might continue for many weeks at this time of year, and at present is quite unprepared and inefficient."

On 23 January 1915, a force of German battlecruisers under the command of Admiral <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz von Hipper</a> sortied to clear the Dogger Bank of any British fishing boats or small craft that might be there to collect intelligence on German movements. However, the British were reading their coded messages and sailed to intercept them with a larger force of British battlecruisers under the command of Admiral Beatty. Contact was initiated at 7:20 a.m. on the 24th when the British light cruiser spotted the German light cruiser . By 7:35 the Germans had spotted Beatty's force and Hipper ordered a turn to the south at , believing that this would suffice if the ships that he saw to his north-west were British battleships and that he could always increase speed to 's maximum speed of if they were British battlecruisers.

Beatty ordered his battlecruisers to make all practicable speed to catch the Germans before they could escape. The leading ships, , and "Tiger", were doing in pursuit and "Lion" opened fire at 8:52 at a range of . The other ships followed a few minutes later but, hampered by the extreme range and decreasing visibility, they did not score their first hit on "Blücher" until 9:09. The German battlecruisers opened fire themselves a few minutes later at 9:11, at a range of , and concentrated their fire on "Lion". At 9:35 Beatty signalled "Engage the corresponding ships in the enemy's line", but Captain Pelly, believing that was already engaging "Blücher", fired at , as did "Lion", which left free to continue attacking "Lion" without risk.
In the meantime "Blücher" had been heavily damaged by fire from all the other battlecruisers; her speed had dropped to and her steering gear had been jammed. Beatty ordered "Indomitable" to attack her at 10:48 a.m. Six minutes later Beatty spotted what he thought was a submarine <a href="periscope">periscope</a> on the starboard bow and ordered an immediate 90° turn to port to avoid the submarine, although he failed to hoist the "Submarine Warning" flag because most of "Lion"s signal halyards had been shot away. Shortly afterward "Lion" lost her remaining dynamo to the rising water which knocked out all remaining light and power. He ordered "Course north-east" at 11:02 to bring his ships back to their pursuit of Hipper. He also hoisted "Attack the rear of the enemy" on the other halyard although there was no connection between the two signals. Rear-Admiral Sir <a href="Gordon%20Moore%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Gordon Moore</a>, temporarily commanding in , thought that the signals meant for him to attack "Blücher", which was about to the north-east, which he did, turning away from Hipper's main body. Beatty tried to correct the mistake, but he was so far behind the leading battlecruisers that his signals could not be read amidst the smoke and haze.

He transferred his flag to the destroyer at 11:50 and set off in pursuit of his battlecruisers. He caught up to them shortly before "Blücher" sank and boarded "Princess Royal" at 12:20. He ordered the pursuit of the German battlecruisers to be resumed, but rescinded the order when it became clear that too much time had been wasted sinking "Blücher" and Hipper's ships would be able to reach German waters before the British could catch them. "Lion" was headed home at when the rest of the battlecruisers caught up with her around 12:45.

During the action, "Tiger" was hit by six German shells, the most significant of which was a shell that burst on the roof of 'Q' turret. Although most of the shell was deflected overboard, fragments penetrated the roof, damaged the left gun's <a href="Breech-loading%20weapon">breech mechanism</a> and jammed the training gear, knocking the turret out of action. Ten men were killed during the battle and 11 wounded. "Tiger"s repairs were completed on 8 February. Like the rest of the battlecruisers, "Tiger"s own gunnery was rapid, but inaccurate, and she achieved only two hits out of 355 shells fired, scoring one hit each on "Seydlitz" and . Her performance was noted and commented upon by the senior leadership of the Royal Navy: Lord Fisher criticised Pelly's performance, calling him a "<a href="wikt%3Apoltroon">poltroon</a>" and adding "The "Tiger"s gunnery seems to have been villainously bad on January 24, yet she seems to have had a lot of practice.". In a memorandum of 11 February 1915 Beatty explained to Pelly where the latter had misconstrued the standing orders, going through "Tiger"s part in the battle blow by blow and comparing it to that of other ships. His final paragraph was conciliatory however: "In making these remarks I have no wish to express censure in any form. I realise that a newly-commissioned ship in her first action has many difficulties to contend with, and I am quite ready to make the fullest allowance for them. My chief aim is to ensure that our next action shall be a complete success." The ship was given a refit in December 1915.

On 31 May 1916, "Tiger" and the 1st BCS had put to sea with the rest of the Battlecruiser Fleet, under Beatty's overall command, to intercept a sortie by the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> into the North Sea. The British had decoded the German radio messages, and left their bases before the Germans put to sea. Hipper's battlecruisers spotted the Battlecruiser Fleet to their west at 3:20 p.m., but Beatty's ships did not see the Germans to their east until 3:30. Two minutes later, Beatty ordered a course change to east-southeast, positioning the British ships to cut off the German's line of retreat, and signalled <a href="action%20stations">action stations</a>. Hipper ordered his ships to turn to starboard, away from the British, to assume a south-easterly course, and reduced speed to to allow three light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group to catch up. With this turn, Hipper was falling back on the High Seas Fleet, behind him. Beatty altered course to the east, as he was still too far north to cut Hipper off.
This was later characterised as the "Run to the South" as Beatty changed course to steer east-southeast at 3:45, now paralleling Hipper's course less than away. The Germans opened fire first at 3:48, followed by the British. The British ships were still in the process of making their turn as only the two leading ships, "Lion" and "Princess Royal", had steadied on their course when the Germans opened fire. The 1st BCS was <a href="Echelon%20formation">echeloned</a> to the right with "Tiger" in the rear and the furthest to the west, closest to the Germans. "Tiger" missed Beatty's fire distribution order, as had "Queen Mary", and "Tiger" engaged "Moltke", instead of "Seydlitz" as Beatty intended. The German fire was accurate from the start, with "Tiger" hit six times by "Moltke" within the first seven minutes; although two of these hits temporarily disabled both 'Q' and 'X' turrets, she was not seriously damaged. By 3:54, the range was down to ; Beatty ordered a course change two <a href="Boxing%20the%20compass">points</a> to starboard to open up the range at 3:57.
Around 4:00, was hit around the rear turret by two or three shells from Von der Tann. She fell out of formation to starboard and started sinking towards the stern and listing to port. Her magazines exploded at 4:03 after more hits destroying the ship with the loss of all hands but three. 
The range gradually increased until the distance between the British and German ships was too great for accurate fire, so Beatty altered course four points to port between 4:12 and 4:15 to close the range. By 4:25, the range was down to and Beatty turned two points to starboard to open the range again. Around this time, "Queen Mary" was hit multiple times in quick succession and her forward magazines exploded. "Tiger", following in "Queen Mary"s wake at a distance of only , had to put her helm hard-a-starboard to avoid colliding with the wreckage. At 4:30, the light cruiser , scouting in front of Beatty's ships, spotted the lead elements of the High Seas Fleet coming north at top speed. Three minutes later, she sighted the topmasts of <a href="Vice-Admiral">Vice-Admiral</a> <a href="Reinhard%20Scheer">Reinhard Scheer</a>'s battleships, but did not report this for another five minutes. Beatty continued south for another two minutes to confirm the sighting before ordering his force to turn north. By this time "Tiger" had been hit a total of 17 times, all but one fired by "Moltke", but she remained fit to fight.

The German battlecruisers made their own turn north in pursuit, but Beatty's ships maintained full speed, and gradually moved out of range. The British battlecruisers turned north, then north-east, to try to rendezvous with the main body of the <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a>, and at 5:40 p.m. opened fire again on their German counterparts. The setting sun blinded the German gunners and they could not make out the British ships and turned away to the north-east at 5:47. Beatty gradually turned towards the east so his ships could cover the Grand Fleet as it deployed into battle formation, but he mistimed his manoeuvre and forced the leading British division further from the Germans. By 6:35, Beatty was following the 3rd BCS as they were leading the Grand Fleet east-southeast, and continuing to engage Hipper's battlecruisers to their south-west. A few minutes earlier, Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180° starboard turn, and Beatty lost sight of them in the haze. At 6:44, Beatty turned his ships south-east, then south-southeast four minutes later, to find Hipper's force. He then ordered the two surviving ships of the 3rd BCS to take position astern of "New Zealand", while slowing to and altering course to the south to stay close to the Grand Fleet. At this moment "Lion"s <a href="gyrocompass">gyrocompass</a> failed and she, followed by the rest of the battlecruisers, made a complete circle before her steering was brought back under control. At 6:55, Scheer ordered another 180° turn, which put the German ships on a converging course again with the Grand Fleet. However, the British had altered course to the south, allowing the Grand Fleet to <a href="Crossing%20the%20T">cross Scheer's "T"</a> and inflict damage on the leading German ships. Scheer ordered yet another 180° turn at 7:13, and successfully extricated the High Seas Fleet from the trap his manoeuvring caused.
The British lost sight of the Germans until spotted smoke to the west-northwest at 8:05 p.m., then identified and engaged several German torpedo boats. On hearing the sound of gunfire, Beatty ordered his ships west, and spotted the German battlecruisers only away. "Inflexible" opened fire at 8:20, followed almost immediately by the rest of the battlecruisers. Shortly after 8:30, the <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a>s of Rear Admiral <a href="Franz%20Mauve">Franz Mauve</a>'s II Battle Squadron were spotted. The British battlecruisers and German pre-dreadnoughts exchanged fire; the Germans only fired a few times before turning away to the west because of poor visibility and the more accurate British gunnery, and disappeared into the mist around 8:40. Beatty's battlecruisers sailed south-southeast, ahead of both the Grand Fleet and the High Seas Fleet, until the order to reverse course for home was given at 2:55 a.m.

"Tiger" and the rest of the battlecruisers reached <a href="Rosyth%20Dockyard">Rosyth Dockyard</a> in Scotland on the morning of 2 June. Docked the next day for repairs which took until 1 July, she was the first of the "Splendid Cats" to be repaired. "Tiger" was hit a total of 18 times during the battle, mostly by shells fired by "Moltke", suffering 24 men killed and 46 wounded. The battlecruiser fired 303 shells from her main guns during the battle and is credited with one hit on "Moltke" and two on . The ship also fired 136 rounds from her 6-inch guns at the light cruiser and German <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s.

After her repairs were completed, "Tiger" served as the temporary flagship of the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron while "Lion" was under repair. In the meantime, on the evening of 18 August the Grand Fleet put to sea in response to a message deciphered by <a href="Room%2040">Room 40</a> which indicated that the High Seas Fleet, less the II Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The German objective was to bombard <a href="Sunderland%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear">Sunderland</a> on the 19th, with extensive reconnaissance provided by airships and submarines. The Grand Fleet sailed with 29 dreadnought battleships and six battlecruisers, including "Tiger". Throughout the 19th, Jellicoe and Scheer received conflicting intelligence, with the result that having reached its rendezvous in the North Sea, the Grand Fleet steered north in the erroneous belief that it had entered a minefield before turning south again. Scheer steered south-eastward pursuing a lone British battle squadron reported by an airship, which was in fact the <a href="Harwich%20Force">Harwich Force</a> under Commodore <a href="Reginald%20Tyrwhitt">Tyrwhitt</a>. Having realised their mistake the Germans then steered for home. The only contact came in the evening when Tyrwhitt sighted the High Seas Fleet but was unable to achieve an advantageous attack position before dark, and broke off contact. Both the British and the German fleets returned home; the British had lost two cruisers to submarine attacks, and a German dreadnought had been damaged by a torpedo.

The ship received a lengthy refit from 10 November 1916 to 29 January 1917 at Rosyth where her deck and turret roof armour were reinforced and additional rangefinders were added over her conning tower and the rear of 'X' turret. For the remainder of the war, "Tiger" uneventfully patrolled the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>, as both fleets were essentially forbidden to risk any more losses. She provided support for British light forces involved in the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Heligoland%20Bight">Second Battle of Heligoland Bight</a> on 17 November 1917, but never came within range of any German forces. The same year saw her undergo a minor refit during which a flying-off platform for a <a href="Sopwith%20Camel">Sopwith Camel</a> was mounted on 'Q' turret and a searchlight platform was added to her third funnel. She underwent a more extensive refit in 1918 which saw her topmast shifted to the top of the derrick-stump and a more substantial observation platform added to the foremast. Some of her short rangefinders were replaced by longer ones as well.

"Tiger" remained in service with the Royal Navy after the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany">Armistice with Germany</a> and she had a flying-off platform added on 'B' turret's roof in 1919. The ship collided with the battleship in late 1920 while assigned to the <a href="Atlantic%20Fleet%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Atlantic Fleet</a>. "Tiger" survived the culling of older capital ships following the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a>, although she was placed in on 22 August 1921. The ship was refitted in March 1922 with a rangefinder fitted on 'X' turret, her original pair of 3-inch AA guns replaced by four guns, and the flying-off platform on 'Q' turret was removed. On 14 February 1924, "Tiger" was recommissioned and became a seagoing training ship, a role she served in throughout the 1920s. Her last major period of activity came in 1929, when went into dockyard hands for refit. While "Hood" was out of commission, "Tiger" returned to active service to keep the Royal Navy's three-ship <a href="British%20Battlecruiser%20Squadron">Battlecruiser Squadron</a> (normally made up of "Hood" plus the smaller and ) up to strength. Although by the 1930s "Tiger" was still in reasonable condition, the decision was taken to discard her following the <a href="London%20Naval%20Conference">London Naval Conference</a> of 1930 as part of an overall reduction in world battleship fleets. Under the command of Captain <a href="Kenneth%20Dewar">Kenneth Dewar</a> from 1928 to 1929, her final commander was <a href="Arthur%20Bedford">Arthur Bedford</a>, and she remained in service with the fleet until "Hood" came out of refit in early 1931, at which time she was taken out of commission in accordance with the terms of the <a href="London%20Naval%20Treaty">London Naval Treaty</a>.

"Tiger" took the cheers of the Atlantic Fleet on 30 March 1931 at <a href="HMNB%20Devonport">Devonport</a>. She <a href="Ship%20decommissioning">paid off</a> on 15 May 1931 at Rosyth, before being sold to <a href="Thos%20W%20Ward">Thos W Ward</a> of <a href="Inverkeithing">Inverkeithing</a> for breaking up in February 1932.

Other Worlds, Universe Science Fiction, and Science Stories

Other Worlds, Universe Science Fiction, and Science Stories were three related US magazines edited by <a href="Raymond%20A.%20Palmer">Raymond A. Palmer</a>. "Other Worlds" was launched in November 1949 by Palmer's Clark Publications and lasted for four years in its first run, with well-received stories such as "Enchanted Village" by <a href="A.%20E.%20van%20Vogt">A. E. van Vogt</a> and "Way in the Middle of the Air", one of <a href="Ray%20Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a>'s "<a href="The%20Martian%20Chronicles">Martian Chronicle</a>" stories. Since Palmer was both publisher and editor, he was free to follow his own editorial policy, and presented a wide array of science fiction.

Palmer entered a partnership with a Chicago businessman in 1953 to create Bell Publications, and printed "Universe Science Fiction" from June 1953. Palmer used the new company to abandon "Other Worlds" and launch "Science Stories", in order to escape from Clark Publications' financial difficulties. Hence "Science Stories" can be considered a continuation of "Other Worlds". "Science Stories" was visually attractive but contained no memorable fiction. "Universe", on the other hand, was drab in appearance, but included some well-received stories, such as <a href="Theodore%20Sturgeon">Theodore Sturgeon</a>'s "<a href="The%20World%20Well%20Lost">The World Well Lost</a>", which examined <a href="homosexuality">homosexuality</a>, a controversial topic for the time.

Palmer's Chicago partner lost interest, so he took over both "Science Stories" and "Universe Science Fiction" under a new company. In 1955 he culled both magazines and brought back "Other Worlds", numbering the issues to make the new magazine appear a continuation of both the original "Other Worlds" and also of "Universe". In this new incarnation the magazine was less successful, but did print <a href="Marion%20Zimmer%20Bradley">Marion Zimmer Bradley</a>'s first novel, "<a href="Falcons%20of%20Narabedla">Falcons of Narabedla</a>". In 1957 Palmer changed the focus of the magazine to <a href="unidentified%20flying%20object">unidentified flying object</a>s (UFOs), retitling it "Flying Saucers from Other Worlds", and after the September 1957 issue no more fiction appeared. Palmer eventually settled on "Flying Saucers, Mysteries of the Space Age" as the title, and in that form it survived until June 1976.

In 1945, <a href="Raymond%20A.%20Palmer">Raymond Palmer</a>, the editor of "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>", published "I Remember Lemuria", by <a href="Richard%20Sharpe%20Shaver">Richard Shaver</a>, in the March 1945 issue. The story, about prehistoric civilizations, explained all the disasters on Earth as the work of evil robots. Palmer presented the story as a mixture of truth and fiction, and the response from readers was strong enough that he bought more stories from Shaver, and promoted what he called the "Shaver Mystery". Circulation grew dramatically, but the publisher, <a href="Ziff%20Davis">Ziff-Davis</a>, became alarmed at the ridicule the stories were drawing in the press, and ordered Palmer to tone down the material. Palmer complied, but planned to leave. He formed his own publishing company, Clark Publications, in 1947, and launched "<a href="Fate%20%28magazine%29">Fate</a>" in 1948. In 1949 Palmer left Ziff-Davis, and launched "Other Worlds Science Stories" in <a href="Digest%20size">digest</a> format; the editor was listed as Robert N. Webster, a pseudonym Palmer used to conceal his activities since he was still working at Ziff-Davis when the first issue appeared. Palmer had planned to distribute free copies of the first issue to fans at that year's <a href="Worldcon">World Science Fiction Convention</a> in <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>. Printing delays meant the magazine did not appear until late in the year. At the convention Palmer announced that "Robert N. Webster" was his pseudonym, and gave the convention organizers the original artwork for the first issue for auction. He also met, and immediately hired, <a href="Bea%20Mahaffey">Bea Mahaffey</a>, a Cleveland fan, as his managing editor, starting with the fourth issue, dated May 1950.

Palmer planned another science fiction (sf) title, "<a href="Imagination%20%28magazine%29">Imagination</a>", to be launched in the fall of 1950, but in June, he suffered a serious accident and was temporarily paralyzed, and Mahaffey took over in his absence. Palmer was able to help with editing both magazines even while in the hospital, but by September he decided to sell "Imagination" to <a href="William%20Hamling%20%28publisher%29">William Hamling</a>, and keep "Other Worlds". Despite the high cover price of 35 cents, "Other Worlds" did well enough for Palmer to increase the publication frequency from bimonthly to every six weeks, but faced competition from two new magazines launched at about the same time: "<a href="The%20Magazine%20of%20Fantasy%20%26amp%3B%20Science%20Fiction">The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction</a>", the first issue of which had appeared at the end of 1949, and "<a href="Galaxy%20Science%20Fiction">Galaxy Science Fiction</a>", which published its first issue in October 1950. Both were very successful, with higher budgets than Palmer was able to afford, and "Other Worlds" suffered as a result. The magazine was doing well enough for Palmer to move it to monthly publication at the end of 1952. It stayed on a regular schedule until the July 1953 issue, but Palmer's finances eventually worsened to the point that he was unable to pay his printer.
Palmer was contacted by a Chicago businessman interested in starting a sf magazine, and took the opportunity to resolve his financial problems by forming a new company, Bell Publications, in partnership with the businessman (whose name was never revealed), and starting two magazines: "Universe Science Fiction" and "Science Stories". "Universe"'s first issue appeared in June 1953, while "Other Worlds" was still being published. It was financed by Palmer's partner, and intended as a bimonthly, though in fact the first four issues were on a quarterly schedule. It was edited by Palmer and Mahaffey, who used the collective pseudonym "George Bell" for the first two issues. "Science Stories" followed in October, also edited by Palmer and Mahaffey as "George Bell", and published by Bell Publications; this was effectively the same magazine as "Other Worlds Science Stories", with "Other Worlds" dropped from the title. In the second issue of "Science Stories", Palmer explained the reason for the new magazine: "For a variety of reasons—and let's be honest, most of them were financial—we had to make a spur-of-the-moment decision to discontinue "Other Worlds" and replace it with the magazine you are now reading. We phoned the typesetter, halted work on the August "OW", and lifted the editorial and stories we needed for "Science Stories" No. 1 from "OW" material on hand". Subscribers to "Other Worlds" were given the option to continue their subscription with whichever of the two magazines they preferred.
When the anonymous businessman lost interest in the project Palmer bought him out, financed by the sale of his half share in Clark Publications, which had published "Other Worlds" and "Fate". He founded Palmer Publications and took over the new magazines with "Universe"'s third issue and "Science Stories"' second issue, and abandoned the pseudonym. He launched "<a href="Mystic%20Magazine">Mystic Magazine</a>", which, like "Fate", published <a href="occult">occult</a> material, both fact and fiction. "Science Stories" failed to sell well, and ceased to appear after the April 1954 issue, but "Universe" continued, going bimonthly after the March 1954 issue. A total of ten issues appeared under the title "Universe Science Fiction", and with the May 1955 issue the title "Other Worlds Science Fiction" reappeared. The new version of "Other Worlds" initially carried both "Universe"'s numbering and the issue numbering from the original run of "Other Worlds". Palmer closed the offices in <a href="Evanston%2C%20Illinois">Evanston</a>, Illinois, and edited the magazine from his home in Wisconsin; Mahaffey continued to work on the magazine by mail from Cincinnati. From November 1955 the format changed to pulp size: this was against the prevailing market winds, as almost all the pulps had died out by this time. In 1956 an unexpected tax bill forced Palmer to let Mahaffey go, and he ran the magazine by himself from that point on.

The following year Palmer switched the magazine's focus to flying saucers. To try to maintain the existing readership while attracting new readers, Palmer emphasized sf and flying saucers in alternate issues: for example, the June 1957 issue was titled "FLYING SAUCERS from Other Worlds", and the July issue was "Flying Saucers from OTHER WORLDS". He also hoped that each issue would be kept longer on newsstands if the distributors thought they were dealing with two magazines. The experiment did not last; from the July/August 1958 issue the title was shortened to "<a href="Flying%20Saucers%20%28magazine%29">Flying Saucers</a>", and the magazine ceased to carry fiction. Palmer retired to <a href="Amherst%2C%20Wisconsin">Amherst, Wisconsin</a>, and took over its printing. Bibliographic sources focus on the science fiction issues, and do not index the magazine after 1958, but it continued publication until 1976 as a non-fiction magazine.

Palmer's interest in the Shaver Mystery did not abate when he left "Amazing Stories", and the lead story for the first issue of "Other Worlds" was Shaver's "The Fall of Lemuria", still presented as truth in the guise of fiction. The cover illustration was by <a href="Malcolm%20Smith%20%28artist%29">Malcolm Smith</a>, a frequent artist for "Amazing." Palmer declared in the first issue that he wanted to present science fiction from across the spectrum: hard-science stories of the kind that appeared in "<a href="Analog%20Science%20Fiction%20and%20Fact">Astounding Science Fiction</a>", and stories representative of the styles of the other leading magazines—"Amazing", "<a href="Planet%20Stories">Planet Stories</a>", and "<a href="Thrilling%20Wonder%20Stories">Thrilling Wonder Stories</a>". Despite this many of the stories in the first issue were routine. Much of the first issue's contents were by "Amazing" regulars, and it initially appeared that the new magazine would not be very much different from Palmer's "Amazing Stories", but within a few issues the quality improved noticeably.

Unlike almost every other sf magazine on the market, "Other Worlds" was edited and published by the same person, which meant there were no constraints on Palmer's editorial policy. He attempted to find new and daring material, and in the early years of the magazine, he obtained some of the better stories being published. <a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28writer%29">Mike Ashley</a>, a historian of science fiction, cites <a href="Eric%20Frank%20Russell">Eric Frank Russell</a>'s "Dear Devil"; "Portrait of a Narcissus" by <a href="Raymond%20F.%20Jones">Raymond F. Jones</a>; "Way in the Middle of the Air", one of <a href="Ray%20Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a>'s "<a href="The%20Martian%20Chronicles">Martian Chronicles</a>" stories; and two stories by <a href="A.%20E.%20van%20Vogt">A.E. van Vogt</a>: "Enchanted Village", one of van Vogt's best-liked stories, and "War of Nerves", part of his <a href="The%20Voyage%20of%20the%20Space%20Beagle">"Voyage of the Space Beagle"</a> series. <a href="Fritz%20Leiber">Fritz Leiber</a> contributed "The Seven Black Priests", one of his <a href="Fafhrd%20and%20the%20Gray%20Mouser">Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser</a> stories, and <a href="E.%20E.%20Smith">E.E. Smith</a>, who had become famous for his <a href="space%20opera">space opera</a>s, switched to <a href="fantasy">fantasy</a> with "Tedric", which appeared in the March 1953 issue. <a href="Poulanderson">Poul Anderson</a> and <a href="Gordon%20R.%20Dickson">Gordon R. Dickson</a> contributed "Heroes Are Made", the first in their Hoka series, and Palmer obtained fiction from other well-known writers such as <a href="Fredric%20Brown">Fredric Brown</a> and <a href="Wilson%20Tucker">Wilson Tucker</a>. Partly because of competition from the newly-launched "Galaxy Science Fiction" and "The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction", Palmer was unable to obtain enough material of this quality to fill the magazine, and most of the remaining stories were unremarkable space adventures. Ashley comments that the stigma of the Shaver Mystery clung to Palmer and damaged the magazine; and suggests that much of the best-quality work in "Other Worlds" was due to the influence of Mahaffey, who in Ashley's opinion "had excellent taste in fiction". A high point of the non-fiction pieces was a series of articles by <a href="L.%20Sprague%20de%20Camp">L. Sprague de Camp</a>, abridged from his book "Lost Continents: The Atlantis Theme in History", which ran from 1952 to 1953. The covers were attractive, often with artwork on both covers, by well-known artists such as Malcolm Smith, Robert Gibson Jones, <a href="Harold%20W.%20McCauley">Harold McCauley</a>, and <a href="Hannes%20Bok">Hannes Bok</a>."Science Stories" maintained the same high quality of artwork. The first issue, dated October 1953, was painted by Bok, who also did the interior illustration for Jack Williamson's story based on the cover. The remaining three covers were by <a href="Virgil%20Finlay">Virgil Finlay</a>, Albert A. Nuetzell, and Jones; Wendy Bousfield, an sf historian, considers the last one the best, and also singles out the last issue's interior illustrations, all by Finlay, for praise. The writing was not up to the standard of the artwork, with <a href="Jack%20Williamson">Jack Williamson</a> and <a href="Mack%20Reynolds">Mack Reynolds</a> the only two authors whose reputation has lasted. A lower page count meant less non-fiction material and readers' departments (such as letters) in "Science Stories" than in "Other Worlds", but Palmer found space for cartoons and advertisements for his own books, such as "The Coming of the Saucers", written with <a href="Kenneth%20Arnold">Kenneth Arnold</a>.

"Science Stories" was visually attractive but lacked memorable story lines. "Universe Science Fiction" took the opposite approach, with uninteresting covers and poor interior artwork, but it had substantial story lines in the first two issues, which sf historian E.F. Casebeer attributes to Mahaffey's influence. <a href="Murray%20Leinster">Murray Leinster</a>, <a href="Mark%20Clifton">Mark Clifton</a> and Mack Reynolds contributed to the early issues, with <a href="Robert%20Bloch">Robert Bloch</a>, providing "Constant Reader", <a href="Theodore%20Sturgeon">Theodore Sturgeon</a>, and "<a href="The%20World%20Well%20Lost">The World Well Lost</a>"; a treatment of homosexuality controversial for the 1950s. Once Palmer became more involved with the magazine again the artwork improved, with Finlay, Lawrence Stevens, and <a href="Edd%20Cartier">Edd Cartier</a> contributing good interior illustrations. In Casebeer's view the Finlay and Lawrence illustrations were the best the magazine had to offer, and he considers the quality of the fiction to have gone downhill after a fairly promising start. In the last three issues the artwork was also weak, with poor quality black-and-white covers and little interior art.

The first issue of the revived "Other Worlds", in May 1955, had a black-and-white cover picture; later issues returned to colour, though until 1956 these were all reprints of covers from the first incarnation of the magazine. For the cover of the November 1955 issue (the first in pulp format) Palmer reprinted artwork by <a href="J.%20Allen%20St.%20John">J. Allen St. John</a> from the back cover of the November 1952 issue; St. John's artwork had saved another Palmer magazine, "<a href="Fantastic%20Adventures">Fantastic Adventures</a>", from cancellation in 1939. The quality of the fiction dropped from the occasional highs of the first run of "Other Worlds". "Falcons of Narabedla", the first novel by <a href="Marion%20Zimmer%20Bradley">Marion Zimmer Bradley</a>, appeared in 1957, and Palmer also bought her first <a href="Darkover%20series">Darkover</a> novel, "Sword of Aldones", though he never ran it and eventually returned the manuscript to Bradley. Palmer hoped to publish "Tarzan on Mars", a novel by <a href="Stuart%20J.%20Byrne">Stuart Byrne</a> that used fictional worlds created by Edgar Rice Burroughs, but he was unable to get authorization from the Burroughs estate, and had to shelve the idea.

Palmer had long been interested in UFOs, and ran an article in "Other Worlds" in 1951 titled "I Flew in a Flying Saucer", bylined "Captain A.V.G.", though Lester del Rey reports in his history of sf magazines that it may have been written by Palmer himself. Eventually Palmer decided to drop science fiction; from June 1957 only three issues—June, July and September—included fiction; thereafter it was a nonfiction magazine about UFOs. He wrote in the following issue that he would print news of flying saucers and rumors, and would debunk any claims he could prove fake. Over the next twenty years he included such fringe ideas such as that the earth was not spherical, and in December 1959 ran an article in "Flying Saucers" that claimed the earth was <a href="Torus">shaped like a donut</a>, and that flying saucers originated from an unexplored source on the earth's surface. In 1965 Palmer published an article by Delmar H. Bryant that debunked the idea that the earth was hollow, but the following year again suggested that the earth might be donut shaped. On the June 1970 issue, the cover picture showed a donut-shaped earth from space; Palmer claimed this was evidence from a satellite photograph.

"Other Worlds" was edited by Raymond Palmer and published by Clark Publications from November 1949 to July 1953, and by Palmer Publications from May 1955 until at least November 1957. "Science Stories" and "Universe Science Fiction" were initially published by Bell Publications, for one and two issues, respectively; thereafter both were published by Palmer Publications. Both magazines were edited by Palmer and Bea Mahaffey. "Universe" and "Science Stories" were in digest format for all their issues and were priced at 35 cents; "Other Worlds" began as a digest and switched to pulp with the November 1955 issue, and was 35 cents until at least the end of 1958. "Other Worlds" had 160 pages for the first run, and 128 pages when it returned in May 1955, dropping to 96 pages for the pulp issues, until at least the November 1957 issue. Both "Universe" and "Science Stories" had 128 pages throughout their runs.

After it became a non-fiction magazine, the title changed to "Flying Saucers, The Magazine of Space Conquest" with the July/August 1958 issue. In 1961 the title changed twice more, first to "Flying Saucers, The Magazine of Space Mysteries", and finally to "Flying Saucers, Mysteries of the Space Age", which it retained until it ceased publication in 1976.

1080° Snowboarding

"1080°" was announced in November 1997 and developed over nine months; it garnered critical acclaim and won an Interactive Achievement Award from the <a href="Academy%20of%20Interactive%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences</a>. "1080°" sold over a million units, and a second installment, "<a href="1080%C2%B0%20Avalanche">1080° Avalanche</a>", was released for the <a href="Nintendo%20GameCube">Nintendo GameCube</a> in November 2003.

The player controls a snowboarder in one of several modes. "1080°" has two trick modes (trick attack and contest), three race modes (race, time attack, and multiplayer), a training mode, and an options mode. The objective of the game is either to arrive quickly at a level's finish line or to receive maximum points for trick combinations.

In "1080°"'s two trick modes, trick attack and contest, players accrue points from completed tricks. In contest mode, players perform tricks and snowboard past flags for points. Trick attack mode requires players to perform a series of tricks throughout a designated level. The game features 25 tricks, all of which are performed by using a combination of circular positions of the <a href="Nintendo%2064%20controller">control stick</a>, the R button, and the B button; point values are allocated based on complexity and required time. The two types of tricks are grab tricks, in which the board is grabbed in a specific way, or spin tricks, in which the snowboarder spins the board a certain number of degrees. The 1080° spin requires nine actions, the most of any trick in the game.

"1080°" has three race modes; in these modes, victory can be achieved by taking separate routes within a course and balancing the snowboarder after a jump to avoid speed loss. Tricks are scored in race modes, but do not count toward victory. In match race mode, the player competes in a series of races against <a href="Artificial%20intelligence">AI</a>-controlled snowboarders. The game times the player throughout the level and players receive a damage meter which fills if the snowboarder falls down or is knocked over. The difficulty level in match races can be set to easy, medium, or hard, adjusting the complexity and number of races. If the player fails at defeating an AI competitor, they must retire. The player is given three chances to beat the computer before the game is over.

Players may initially choose from five snowboarding characters: two from Japan, and one each from Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Each snowboarder has different abilities and is suited for different levels and modes, since each has varying statistics in fields such as technique, speed, and weight. Three additional snowboarders are unlocked by completing certain game levels and modes. Eight snowboards are initially available for every character, and one additional snowboard may be unlocked later in the game. Each board also excels in different situations, since each has different strengths in categories such as balance and edge control.

"1080°"'s release was announced on 21 November 1997 at Nintendo's <a href="SpaceWorld">SpaceWorld</a> trade show; the game's working title was then "Vertical Edge Snowboarding". "1080°" was one of several snowboarding games released for the Nintendo 64 in 1998, others being "<a href="Big%20Mountain%202000">Big Mountain 2000</a>" and "<a href="Snowboard%20Kids">Snowboard Kids</a>". Before the game's release, journalists were able to play "1080°" at the January 1998 Nintendo Gamers' Summit.

"1080°" was programmed by Englishmen Giles Goddard and Colin Reed, developed and published by <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>, and produced by <a href="Shigeru%20Miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>. Goddard and Reed had previously programmed "<a href="Wave%20Race%2064">Wave Race 64</a>", which sold over a million copies and was a huge commercial success. When developing "1080°", Goddard and Reed used a technique called "skinning" to eliminate joints between the polygons composing the characters. Their programming used a combination of standard animation and <a href="inverse%20kinematics">inverse kinematics</a>, creating characters whose appearance during collisions is affected by what object is hit, what direction the collision occurs in, and the speed at which the collision takes place. <a href="Tommy%20Hilfiger">Tommy Hilfiger</a> outfits and Lamar snowboards appear throughout "1080°" as <a href="product%20placement">product placement</a>. "1080°"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s soundtrack of "techno and beats" with "thrashy, vocals" was composed by Kenta Nagata, who also composed soundtracks for "<a href="Mario%20Kart%2064">Mario Kart 64</a>" and other Nintendo games.

"1080°"'s development took place from April or May 1997 to March 1998. The game was released on 28 February 1998 in Japan and on 31 March 1998 in North America. Nintendo delayed the game's European release because they hoped to boost sales with a winter release; "1080°" was eventually released on 30 November 1998, in Europe and the <a href="PAL%20region">PAL region</a>.

"1080° Snowboarding" received "generally favorable" reviews, according to <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregator</a> website <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>. It won the <a href="Academy%20of%20Interactive%20Arts%20%26amp%3B%20Sciences">Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences</a>' 1999 Console Sports Game of the Year award, and was called "one of the best values in both sports and racing gaming" by Josh Smith <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>. "1080° Snowboarding" has been perceived to be a leader among snowboarding titles at the time, with <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Levi Buchanan stating: "every single snowboarding game that followed 1080 borrows from Nintendo's formula". "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" hailed it as the "most convincing video game emulation of the snowboarding experience so far" with an "atmosphere of sobriety" unlike any other Nintendo game at the time.

The game's graphics were of the highest quality for the <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a> at the time. Smith praised general aspects of the game's graphics such as their crispness, detail, smoothness, and lack of polygon dropout. Reviewers praised the game's camera use, the game's "very solid" physics model, the impression of racers' speed, and the game's snow effects (sun reflected in the snow as appropriate, and fluffy snow and packed snow appeared and behaved differently). Graphical faults included occasional pop-up, misplaced shadows, and <a href="lag">lag</a> when racers passed through on-track trees; these problems were generally identified as minor.

Although writing a positive review, "Edge" found faults in the game's AI, stating that the game suffered from "cheating" CPU opponents. They criticized the AI's simplicity and ability to quickly catch up to the player near the end of a race; they also noted the AI's "limited series of predetermined routes" and the possibility of a player learning where and when an AI falls over, "offering an opportunity to pass [the computer], but conveying little satisfaction with it." "Edge" also stated that the PAL release delay "is frankly ludicrous." They believed that, due to Nintendo's slump of noteworthy releases, "any quality title is likely to top the charts with little difficulty."

Writing for <a href="AllGame">AllGame</a>, Shawn Sackenheim considered the "highly technical" control scheme of "1080° Snowboarding" one of the game's strengths despite its initial difficulty. Alex Constantides of "<a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games">Computer and Video Games</a>" positively reviewed the control scheme, but disagreed on its difficulty, noting "the controls have been implemented so brilliantly that you're able to play perfectly well with just one hand on the stick and Z button." GameSpot called the game's control "thoroughly involving" and said that "[t]he crouch move alone – which makes for supertight turns – makes this fun to play." The music was also generally praised, with Matt Casamassina of IGN calling it "a shining example of what can be achieved on the format" and Sackenheim calling it "one of the best N64 soundtracks to date". Sackenheim also praised the game's sound effects.

In a retrospective review by the "<a href="Official%20Nintendo%20Magazine">Official Nintendo Magazine</a>" in 2006, Steve Jarratt commented that "1080° Snowboarding" "boasted the best video game representation of snow," and was complemented by "swooshy" sound effects. Positive comments were also made about handling and the quality of the multiplayer. In summary, Jarratt believed "this was a straight-up snowboarder, stunt-free but fast and fun." The magazine also ranked it the 87th best game available on Nintendo platforms. The staff felt it was the most realistic snowboarding game ever made.

<a href="PC%20Data">PC Data</a>, which tracked sales in the United States, reported that "1080° Snowboarding" sold 817,529 units and earned $40.9 million in revenues by the end of 1998. This made it the country's seventh-best-selling Nintendo 64 release of the year. The game ultimately sold 1,230,000 units in the United States, and over 23,000 in Japan. It did not, however, match the success of the developers' first game, "Wave Race 64" which sold 1,950,000 units in the United States and 154,000 in Japan. "<a href="1080%C2%B0%20Avalanche">1080° Avalanche</a>", a sequel to "1080° Snowboarding", was released for the <a href="GameCube">GameCube</a> in 2003; the sequel received a harsher critical reception, due to "frame rate issues and limited gameplay". "1080° Snowboarding" was re-released on the <a href="Wii">Wii</a>'s <a href="Virtual%20Console">Virtual Console</a> service in 2008.

<doc id="1177013" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1177013" title="Luke P. Blackburn">
Luke P. Blackburn

Luke Pryor Blackburn (June 16, 1816September 14, 1887) was an American physician, philanthropist, and politician from <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>. He was elected the <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Kentucky">28th</a> <a href="governor%20of%20Kentucky">governor of Kentucky</a>, serving from 1879 to 1883. Until the election of <a href="Ernie%20Fletcher">Ernie Fletcher</a> in 2003, Blackburn was the only physician to serve as governor of Kentucky.

After earning a medical degree at <a href="Transylvania%20University">Transylvania University</a>, Blackburn moved to <a href="Natchez%2C%20Mississippi">Natchez, Mississippi</a>, and gained national fame for implementing the first successful <a href="quarantine">quarantine</a> against <a href="yellow%20fever">yellow fever</a> in the <a href="Mississippi%20embayment">Mississippi River valley</a> in 1848. He came to be regarded as an expert on yellow fever and often worked "<a href="pro%20bono">pro bono</a>" to combat outbreaks. Among his philanthropic ventures was the construction of a hospital for boatmen working on the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> using his personal funds. He later successfully lobbied <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> to construct a series of similar hospitals along the Mississippi.

Although too old to serve in the military, Blackburn supported the Confederate cause during the Civil War. In the early days of the war, he acted as a civilian agent for the governments of Kentucky and Mississippi. By 1863, he was aiding Confederate blockade runners in Canada. In 1864, he traveled to Bermuda to help combat a yellow fever outbreak that threatened Confederate blockade running operations there. Shortly after the war's end, a Confederate double agent accused him of having carried out a plot to start a yellow fever epidemic in the Northern United States that would have hampered the Union war effort. Blackburn was accused of collecting linens and garments used by yellow fever patients and smuggling them into the Northern states to be sold. The evidence against Blackburn was considerable, although much of it was either circumstantial or provided by witnesses of questionable reputation. Although he was acquitted by a <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a> court, public sentiment was decidedly against him throughout much of the United States. Today, historians still disagree as to the strength of the evidence supporting Blackburn's role in the alleged plot. Any plot of this nature was destined to fail, however; in 1900, Walter Reed discovered that yellow fever is spread by mosquitoes, not by contact.

Blackburn remained in Canada to avoid prosecution by U.S. authorities, but he returned to his home country in 1868 to help combat a yellow fever outbreak along the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf</a> Coast of Texas and <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>. Although the charges against him had not been dropped, he was not arrested or prosecuted. He rehabilitated his public image by rendering aid in yellow fever outbreaks in <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a>, in 1873, <a href="Fernandina%2C%20Florida">Fernandina, Florida</a>, in 1877, and <a href="Hickman%2C%20Kentucky">Hickman, Kentucky</a>, in 1878. Dubbed the "Hero of Hickman", Blackburn's ministrations propelled him to the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> gubernatorial nomination the following year. In the general election, he defeated <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> <a href="Walter%20Evans%20%28American%20politician%29">Walter Evans</a> by a wide margin. As governor, Blackburn won passage of several reforms in the areas of state finance and internal improvements, but his signature accomplishments were in the area of penal reform. Troubled by the conditions at the penitentiary in <a href="Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky">Frankfort</a>, Blackburn attempted to ease overcrowding through liberal use of his gubernatorial pardon, earning him the derisive nickname "Lenient Luke". He also secured approval of the construction of a <a href="Kentucky%20State%20Penitentiary">new penitentiary</a> at <a href="Eddyville%2C%20Kentucky">Eddyville</a>, the adoption of a warden system to replace the corrupt private oversight of the old penitentiary, and the implementation of the state's first parole system. Although his record of reform led historians to laud him as "the father of <a href="prison%20reform">prison reform</a> in Kentucky", his liberal pardon record and expenditure of scarce taxpayer money to improve the living conditions of prisoners was unpopular at the time, and he was booed and shouted down at his own party's nominating convention in 1883. After his term as governor, he returned to his medical practice and died in 1887. The <a href="Blackburn%20Correctional%20Complex">Blackburn Correctional Complex</a>, a minimum-security penal facility near <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington, Kentucky</a>, was named in his honor in 1972.

Luke Blackburn was born June 16, 1816, in <a href="Woodford%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Woodford County, Kentucky</a>. He was the fourth of thirteen children born to Edward M. ("Ned") and Lavinia (Bell) Blackburn. Blackburn's great-uncle, <a href="Gideon%20Blackburn">Gideon Blackburn</a>, was a well-known <a href="Presbyterianism">Presbyterian</a> missionary and served as president of <a href="Centre%20College">Centre College</a> in <a href="Danville%2C%20Kentucky">Danville, Kentucky</a>. Many of Blackburn's relatives were involved in politics. His maternal grandfather was a delegate to the 1799 Kentucky Constitutional Convention and his uncle, William Blackburn, was <a href="President%20Pro%20Tempore%20of%20the%20Kentucky%20Senate">President Pro Tempore of the Kentucky Senate</a> and acting <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Kentucky">lieutenant governor</a> in the administration of Governor <a href="James%20Turner%20Morehead%20%28Kentucky%29">James Turner Morehead</a>. Noted statesman <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a> was also a distant cousin, and occasionally visited the Blackburn home.
Blackburn obtained his early education in the local public schools. At age sixteen, he began a medical apprenticeship under his uncle, physician Churchill Blackburn. During his apprenticeship, he aided his uncle in treating victims of <a href="cholera">cholera</a> outbreaks in <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington</a> and <a href="Paris%2C%20Kentucky">Paris</a>. He later matriculated to <a href="Transylvania%20University">Transylvania University</a> in <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington, Kentucky</a>, where he earned a medical degree in March 1835. After graduation, he opened a medical practice in Lexington and was instrumental in combating a cholera epidemic in nearby <a href="Versailles%2C%20Kentucky">Versailles</a>. He accepted no payment for his services during the epidemic.

On November 24, 1835, Blackburn married his distant cousin, Ella Gist Boswell. Boswell's father, Dr. Joseph Boswell, had died in the Lexington cholera epidemic a year earlier. The couple's only child, son Cary Bell Blackburn, was born in 1837. Just before Cary's birth, Blackburn invested heavily in the hemp rope and bagging industry and suffered a significant financial loss when the business venture subsequently failed. In 1843, Blackburn was elected as a <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig</a> to the <a href="Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">Kentucky House of Representatives</a> and served a single, undistinguished term. He did not seek re-election, and in 1844, he and his younger brother opened a medical practice in <a href="Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky">Frankfort, Kentucky</a>.

Drawn by the city's prosperous economy, the Blackburns relocated to <a href="Natchez%2C%20Mississippi">Natchez, Mississippi</a>, in 1847. Luke Blackburn quickly became an active member of the community, helping found a <a href="Temperance%20movement">temperance</a> society, joining a militia group, and becoming the administrator of a local hospital. He became a close associate of <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a> and <a href="William%20Johnson%20%28barber%29">William Johnson</a>. In 1848, Blackburn served as the city's health officer and implemented the first successful <a href="quarantine">quarantine</a> against a <a href="yellow%20fever">yellow fever</a> outbreak in the <a href="Mississippi%20embayment">Mississippi River valley</a>. Using his own personal funds, he established a hospital for boatmen who navigated the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a>. He also successfully lobbied the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> to establish a hospital in Natchez; upon its completion in 1852, he was appointed surgeon there. In 1854, he implemented another successful quarantine against yellow fever. The <a href="Mississippi%20Legislature">Mississippi Legislature</a> commissioned Blackburn to lobby the <a href="Louisiana%20State%20Legislature">Louisiana State Legislature</a> to establish a quarantine at New Orleans to protect cities along the Mississippi River; Louisiana authorized him to organize such a system.

Blackburn and his son Cary traveled to <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, Pennsylvania, in September 1854 to secure an apprenticeship for Cary under noted physician <a href="Samuel%20D.%20Gross">Samuel D. Gross</a>. While they were there, a yellow fever outbreak hit <a href="Fort%20Washington%20%28New%20York%29">Fort Washington</a> near <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a>, New York. The mayor of New York City asked Blackburn to help treat victims of the outbreak; Blackburn accepted the invitation and refused compensation for his services. When he returned home in November 1856, he found his wife Ella, who suffered from <a href="Edema">dropsy</a> and a nervous condition, ailing with a fever. Despite Blackburn's efforts to save her, Ella Blackburn's condition worsened and she died before the end of the month. Blackburn was stricken with grief, and friends encouraged him to tour Europe, as he had often spoken of doing, to ease his sorrow. He did so in early 1857, visiting hospitals in England, Scotland, France, and Germany. While in <a href="Paris%2C%20France">Paris</a>, Blackburn met fellow Kentuckian Julia M. Churchill, who was traveling with her sister and niece. Blackburn and Churchill cut their journeys short, returned home, and were married in November 1857. After their honeymoon, the couple took up residence in New Orleans in January 1858, and Blackburn resumed his medical practice. A brief poem written by Blackburn indicates that the couple had a daughter named Abby, but the child apparently died as an infant, and her birth and death dates are unknown.

Blackburn's sympathies lay with the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederacy</a> at the outbreak of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>. Too old to enlist in the <a href="Confederate%20Army">Confederate Army</a>, he acted as an <a href="diplomat">envoy</a> for Kentucky governor <a href="Beriah%20Magoffin">Beriah Magoffin</a> to obtain weapons from <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> for the defense of Kentucky, but he failed to secure the arms. In early 1862, he was assigned to the staff of <a href="General%20officers%20in%20the%20Confederate%20States%20Army%23Major%20general">Major General</a> <a href="Sterling%20Price">Sterling Price</a> as a surgeon. <a href="Governor%20of%20Mississippi">Mississippi Governor</a> <a href="John%20J.%20Pettus">John J. Pettus</a> appointed him as one of two commissioners to oversee the care of the state's wounded soldiers in February 1863. After securing sufficient medical supplies for the wounded, Blackburn traveled to <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a>, to meet with <a href="Confederate%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Confederate Secretary of War</a> <a href="James%20Seddon">James Seddon</a> and offered to serve as General Inspector of Hospitals and Camps without taking compensation or a rank. When the offer was refused, Governor Pettus asked Blackburn to travel to Canada to collect provisions for <a href="blockade%20runner">blockade runner</a>s there. Blackburn and his wife left Mississippi for <a href="City%20of%20Halifax">Halifax</a>, Nova Scotia, in August 1863, then continued on to <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a> (in what was then the <a href="Province%20of%20Canada">Province of Canada</a>) where they lodged in a boardinghouse. On one occasion, Blackburn was aboard a blockade running ship carrying ice from Halifax to <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile, Alabama</a>, when the ship was captured by the <a href="Union%20Navy">Union Navy</a>. Union officials assumed Blackburn was a civilian passenger on the vessel and released him, after which he returned to Canada.

A devastating outbreak of yellow fever struck the island of <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a> in April 1864. The island was a major base of operations for Confederate blockade runners, and the epidemic threatened their continued operations there. At the request of <a href="Charles%20Monck%2C%204th%20Viscount%20Monck">Charles Monck</a>, the <a href="Governor%20General%20of%20Canada">Governor General of the United Provinces of Canada</a>, Blackburn traveled to Bermuda to aid soldiers and civilians there. Blackburn continued his ministrations until mid-July when he briefly returned to Halifax. The epidemic on the island continued, and Blackburn returned there in September to continue aiding the victims. He remained there until the outbreak abated in mid-October. For his efforts in Bermuda, Blackburn received 100 <a href="Pound%20sterling">British pounds</a> and a commendation from <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>. Although little is known of his actions in Canada for the remainder of the war, he was rumored to have been part of a plot to incite massive insurrections in <a href="New%20England">New England</a> as a diversion, allowing fellow Confederate agent <a href="Thomas%20Hines">Thomas Hines</a> to lead a prison break at <a href="Camp%20Douglas%20%28Chicago%29">Camp Douglas</a> in Chicago. When word of the plot was leaked to Union officials, they sent troops to reinforce Boston, Massachusetts, Blackburn's rumored target, quashing his role in the operation.

On April 12, 1865, just days after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Appomattox%20Court%20House">last major battle of the Civil War</a>, a Confederate <a href="double%20agent">double agent</a> named Godfrey Joseph Hyams approached the U.S. consul in Toronto claiming to have information about a plot by Blackburn to infect Northern cities with yellow fever. Hyams said he and Blackburn had been introduced by Confederate agent Stuart Robinson at the <a href="Queen%27s%20Hotel%2C%20Toronto">Queen's Hotel</a> in Toronto in December 1863. According to Hyams, he had agreed to help Blackburn smuggle trunks of clothes used by patients infected with yellow fever into Boston, Massachusetts; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Washington D.C.; <a href="New%20Bern%2C%20North%20Carolina">New Bern, North Carolina</a>; and <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a> (the latter two cities being occupied by Union troops). Hyams said he was instructed to sell the trunks' contents to used clothing merchants, and that Blackburn, subscribing to the common nineteenth century belief that yellow fever could be spread by contact, hoped that by dispersing the "contaminated" articles throughout these major cities he could trigger an epidemic that would cripple the Northern war effort. Hyams further alleged that Blackburn had filled a <a href="valise">valise</a> with fine shirts and instructed him to deliver it to President <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> at the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>, saying they were from an anonymous admirer. Upon completion of these tasks, Hyams said, Blackburn had promised to pay him $60,000. Hyams claimed he delivered the trunks as agreed, but did not attempt to deliver the valise to President Lincoln. According to his testimony, he never received more than nominal compensation for his efforts, partially prompting his decision to reveal the plot to the authorities.

Independent of Hyams' testimony, officials in Bermuda had received information that Blackburn had collected a second cache of "contaminated" garments and linens. According to this information, Blackburn contracted with Edward Swan, a hotel owner in <a href="St.%20George%27s%20Island%2C%20Bermuda">St. George's</a>, to store them until mid-1865 and then ship them to New York City, presumably in an attempt to start an outbreak there. Acting on this intelligence, Bermudan officials raided Swan's hotel and found three trunks of garments and linens with stains consistent with the "black vomit" symptomatic of yellow fever. Swan was arrested and charged with violating the local health code. The contents of the trunks were soaked with <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a> and buried.

The <a href="assassination%20of%20Abraham%20Lincoln">assassination of Abraham Lincoln</a> just two days after Hyams related his story to Canadian officials heightened U.S. interest in arresting Blackburn to connect the assassination to Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his operatives in Canada. The U.S. Bureau of Military Justice ordered Blackburn's arrest for attempted murder, but an arrest could not be effected because Blackburn was in Canada, beyond the Bureau's jurisdiction. The subsequent discovery of the cache of garments and linens in Bermuda convinced Canadian authorities to act. They arrested Blackburn on May 19, 1865, charging him with violation of Canada's neutrality in the Civil War. He was held for trial on $8,000 bond. In October 1865, a Toronto court acquitted Blackburn on grounds that the trunks of garments had been shipped to Nova Scotia, which was out of the court's jurisdiction. A charge of conspiracy to commit murder was dropped after Blackburn's attorney reminded the court that such a charge could only be made if the accused had made an attempt on the life of a head of state. Blackburn did not testify in the trial and only spoke of the plot years later when he denounced it as "too preposterous for intelligent gentlemen to believe."

Historians disagree as to the strength of the evidence against Blackburn, and many of the federal and Confederate records relating to the case have been lost. Writing in the journal "America's Civil War", <a href="United%20States%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> physician J. D. Haines notes that the Confederate agents who testified against Blackburn were of dubious reputation. Hyams in particular received <a href="immunity%20from%20prosecution">immunity from prosecution</a> and was paid for his testimony. Haines also points out that Blackburn's previous reputation as a humanitarian was ignored; in the hysteria following Lincoln's assassination, <a href="conspiracy%20theory">conspiracy theories</a> abounded and Northerners were inclined to believe the worst about anyone with Confederate sympathies. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" vilified Blackburn as "The Yellow Fever Fiend" and "a hideous devil". Historian <a href="Edward%20Steers%2C%20Jr.">Edward Steers</a> concedes that the evidence against Blackburn was <a href="Circumstantial%20evidence">circumstantial</a>, but in his book "Blood on the Moon", he contends that enough evidence survives not only to prove Blackburn's involvement in the plot, but to show that high-ranking Confederate officials up to and including President Jefferson Davis were aware of, condoned, and financed it. If true, Blackburn's plot would have represented one of the earliest attempts at <a href="biological%20warfare">biological warfare</a>.

After his acquittal, Blackburn remained in Canada to avoid arrest and prosecution by U.S. authorities. When he learned of a yellow fever outbreak in New Orleans and the Texas Gulf Coast, Blackburn wrote to President <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a> on September 4, 1867, asking permission to return to the U.S. and help treat the disease. Not waiting for Johnson's response—which never came—Blackburn returned to the U.S., arriving in Louisville on September 25, 1867, en route to New Orleans. After rendering aid during the epidemic, he and his family moved to an <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a> <a href="Plantations%20in%20the%20American%20South">plantation</a> owned by his wife.

No attempt to arrest Blackburn was made, and he returned to Kentucky with his family in early 1873. The family lived in Louisville's <a href="Galt%20House">Galt House</a> hotel, and Blackburn resumed his medical practice in that city. During a cholera epidemic in 1873, Blackburn rightly theorized that the disease was spread by the consumption of contaminated water, but most citizens accepted the competing theory that cholera was a <a href="Miasma%20theory%20of%20disease">miasmatic disease</a>. This theory was espoused by Thomas S. Bell, a better-known physician in Louisville. Thousands died as a result of failing to heed Blackburn's advice to boil potentially contaminated water before drinking it. Blackburn's philanthropic work included treating victims of yellow fever outbreaks in <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a>, in 1873 and <a href="Fernandina%2C%20Florida">Fernandina, Florida</a>, in 1877. He refused to accept compensation for his services in either city, but was presented with gifts from appreciative residents in both cases. Several southern newspapers also carried glowing accounts of Blackburn's service.

Louisville's "<a href="The%20Courier-Journal">Courier-Journal</a>" carried an announcement of Blackburn's candidacy for the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> gubernatorial nomination in Kentucky on February 11, 1878. It is not clear why, with only meager prior political experience, he decided to seek the office. He may have been influenced by the members of his family who were involved in politics. His brother <a href="Joseph%20Clay%20Stiles%20Blackburn">Joseph</a> was, at the time, a member of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a>, and another brother, James, had served in the <a href="Kentucky%20Senate">Kentucky Senate</a>. Two of his wife's brothers also held political office; Samuel Churchill was <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20of%20Kentucky">Secretary of State</a> under Governors <a href="John%20L.%20Helm">John L. Helm</a>, <a href="John%20W.%20Stevenson">John W. Stevenson</a>, and <a href="Preston%20Leslie">Preston Leslie</a>, and <a href="Thomas%20James%20Churchill">Thomas Churchill</a> served as treasurer and later <a href="Governor%20of%20Arkansas">governor</a> of the state of <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>. Whatever the reason, even his friends did not believe his announcement was wise due to his political inexperience. He opened his campaign with a speech in <a href="Owen%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Owen County</a> on March 29, 1878.
About the same time as his gubernatorial campaign began, Blackburn appeared before the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">Kentucky General Assembly</a> to advocate measures to protect the state against disease outbreaks, including the creation of a state board of health and the construction of quarantine centers in the state's border towns. To a large degree, his pleas fell upon deaf ears, with the exception of his proposal for the state board of health, which was created in March 1878. Soon after, news came that yellow fever had appeared in the lower Mississippi Valley earlier than usual; by August 1878, it had reached epidemic proportions. Blackburn advocated implementing quarantines to deal with the influx of people fleeing north to escape the disease, but many of the state's doctors did not believe yellow fever could survive as far north as Kentucky. Some towns in the <a href="Jackson%20Purchase">Jackson Purchase</a> region attempted to implement crude quarantines, but the city of Louisville completely ignored Blackburn's advice and welcomed refugees from the South. Blackburn temporarily halted his gubernatorial campaign and traveled to Louisville to help treat those who arrived there already suffering from the disease.

On September 5, the mayor of <a href="Hickman%2C%20Kentucky">Hickman, Kentucky</a>, a small western town along the Mississippi River, telegraphed the state board of health, informing them that yellow fever had reached epidemic levels in the city and requesting that Blackburn be sent to them as soon as possible. Blackburn arrived on September 7 to find that roughly 20 percent of the town's population were ill with yellow fever. He organized cleanup crews to disinfect the town and a squad of Negroes to guard vacated homes. In late September, when it appeared the Hickman epidemic was waning, Blackburn traveled to <a href="Chattanooga%2C%20Tennessee">Chattanooga</a> and <a href="Martin%2C%20Tennessee">Martin, Tennessee</a>, to render aid, but within ten days, he received word that the outbreak in Hickman had resurged and spread to nearby <a href="Fulton%2C%20Kentucky">Fulton, Kentucky</a>. Blackburn returned to the area and continued his ministrations until late October, when the outbreak had fully subsided.

Returning to Louisville, Blackburn was fêted at the Galt House hotel. For weeks, receptions were held in his honor, gifts of appreciation poured in from across the state and region, and he was hailed as the "Hero of Hickman". It was against this backdrop that he resumed his gubernatorial campaign in November 1878. Two other men also sought the Democratic gubernatorial nomination: <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Kentucky">Lieutenant Governor</a> <a href="John%20C.%20Underwood">John C. Underwood</a> and former Congressman <a href="Thomas%20Laurens%20Jones">Thomas Laurens Jones</a>. Before the yellow fever outbreak, Underwood had been the favorite, but public sentiment had turned in Blackburn's favor after his service to the people of Hickman. Underwood questioned whether Blackburn's medical background had adequately prepared him to be the state's chief executive; he also mounted a failed legal challenge that claimed Blackburn had not met the constitutional state residency requirement of seven years. In late March 1879, however, Underwood determined that he would not be able to overcome the "avalanche" of support for Blackburn and withdrew his candidacy. At the May 1 Democratic nominating convention, Blackburn was nominated by an overwhelming majority—935 delegates to the convention voted for him compared to just 22 for Jones.

Due to ill health, Blackburn could not take an active part in the campaign. He sought relief from his ailments at <a href="Crab%20Orchard%2C%20Kentucky">Crab Orchard</a> Springs, while much of the campaign oratory was delivered on his behalf by fellow Democrats <a href="Boyd%20Winchester">Boyd Winchester</a>, <a href="Parker%20Watkins%20Hardin">Parker Watkins Hardin</a>, <a href="W.%20C.%20P.%20Breckinridge">W. C. P. Breckinridge</a>, and others. <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republicans</a>, who had nominated <a href="Walter%20Evans%20%28American%20politician%29">Walter Evans</a>, had fewer speakers with which to canvass the state, and were at a decided disadvantage. Democrats attacked the administrations of Republican <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">Presidents</a> <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> and <a href="Rutherford%20B.%20Hayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a>, cited the alleged abuses perpetrated in the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">South</a> by <a href="Carpetbagger">Carpetbagger</a>s and <a href="Scalawag">Scalawag</a>s, and leveled charges that Republicans favored capitalists over the state's working class. Republican orators, led by <a href="William%20O%27Connell%20Bradley">William O'Connell Bradley</a>, charged Democrats with financial extravagance, citing a $3 million surplus in the state treasury in 1865 compared with a $1 million debt in 1878. Bradley claimed that Democrats had maintained their power in the state through <a href="gerrymandering">gerrymandering</a> election districts. He cited poor conditions at the state penitentiary and inadequate funding of public education as evidence of Democratic mismanagement of the state.

In late May 1879, the Republican-leaning "Cincinnati Gazette" reported on Blackburn's alleged plot to infect northern cities with yellow fever during the Civil War, apparently the first time the incident had been reported in Kentucky. The newspaper formed a special department for the sole purpose of investigating the claims against Blackburn and published a daily column in which it related the department's findings. In the wake of the "Gazette"'s investigation, other Northern newspapers, including the "<a href="The%20Repository">Canton Repository</a>", "Cleveland Herald", and "<a href="Philadelphia%20Press">Philadelphia Press</a>", derided Kentuckians for even considering the election of Blackburn (who they nicknamed "Dr. Blackvomit"). The scandal gained more traction nationally than in Kentucky. Blackburn did not respond to the accusations, and Kentucky Republicans barely made mention of it, knowing that the northern press in general and the "Cincinnati Gazette" in particular were widely distrusted in the state. Kentucky newspaper editor <a href="Henry%20Watterson">Henry Watterson</a> opined that most Kentuckians already knew about Blackburn's Civil War activities and either explicitly approved of them or were apathetic about events that had occurred a decade and a half earlier.

In the general election, Blackburn defeated Evans by a vote of 125,790 (56%) to 81,882 (36%), the largest Democratic margin of victory in a decade. <a href="Greenback%20Party">Greenback Party</a> candidate C. W. Cook garnered 18,954 votes, approximately 8 percent of the total votes cast. These votes came mainly at the expense of Blackburn and the Democrats. Until the election of <a href="Ernie%20Fletcher">Ernie Fletcher</a> in 2003, Blackburn would be the only physician elected governor of Kentucky.

Immediately after his election, Blackburn began planning ways to balance the state's budget. In his 1880 address to the legislature, Blackburn reported that since 1867, the state had spent three million dollars more than it had taken in. Previous administrations had paid for the excess by using money from the federal government for "war claims" by the state and money from the state's <a href="sinking%20fund">sinking fund</a>. Further, an <a href="Panic%20of%201873">economic depression</a> had lowered property values and the state legislature had, in response to public demand, lowered taxes, further shrinking government income. Blackburn forcefully asserted that the situation must be remedied.

In response to recommendations from the governor, the General Assembly enacted cost-saving reforms in the judicial system, including the abolition of criminal, chancery, and common pleas courts, dividing the state instead into 18 circuit court districts. The number of jurors required for certain cases was reduced, juror salaries were set at a fixed rate, and penalties were established for soliciting jury duty. Reimbursement amounts for transporting and caring for prisoners were capped to prevent inflation of costs by local law enforcement. Salaries of state officials were reduced by 20 percent. The state <a href="property%20tax">property tax</a> was also increased from 40 to 45 cents per $100 of taxable property, and laws were strengthened to facilitate the collection of delinquent taxes.

Blackburn's primary focus was on reforms to the state's penal system. According to Blackburn, 953 prisoners were being held at the state penitentiary, although the structure only contained 780 cells. Conditions in the penitentiary were poor and resulted in many illnesses. One fifth of the state's prisoners suffered from <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> in 1875. When Blackburn became governor in 1879, the <a href="mortality%20rate">mortality rate</a> of the almost one thousand inmates in the state penitentiary was over 7 percent. <a href="Scurvy">Scurvy</a> caused by poor nutrition afflicted 75 percent of prisoners. Blackburn compared conditions at the penitentiary to the infamous <a href="Black%20Hole%20of%20Calcutta">Black Hole of Calcutta</a>.

The poor conditions at the penitentiary were partially because the state leased management of the facility to private contractors, who frequently neglected prisoners' needs to cut costs. These contractors often provided benefits such as cheap laundry services and free meals to legislators to secure contracts and encourage them to ignore their abuse of prisoners. Blackburn called for the contract system to be replaced with a system of oversight by wardens employed by the state.

Before the General Assembly could act on his recommendations, Blackburn began granting <a href="clemency">pardons</a> to relieve <a href="prison%20overcrowding">prison overcrowding</a>. He particularly favored clemency for the incurably sick so they could go home to die with their families. During his term, Blackburn pardoned over one thousand individuals, earning him the nickname "Lenient Luke". The pardons were extremely unpopular with both the public and the Democratic political establishment. Several newspapers claimed that Blackburn sold pardons for two dollars apiece, though no evidence exists to support such an accusation.

In the 1880 legislative session, the General Assembly approved Blackburn's recommendation to construct <a href="Kentucky%20State%20Penitentiary">a new state penitentiary</a> in <a href="Eddyville%2C%20Kentucky">Eddyville</a>. Legislators also responded to Blackburn's call for a warden system, authorizing the state to employ a warden, deputy warden, clerk, physician, and chaplain for the penitentiary. As a means of alleviating overcrowding, the Assembly allowed private contractors to lease <a href="Penal%20labour">convict labor</a> from the penitentiary. These contractors would be responsible for feeding, clothing, housing, and caring for the prisoners in their charge. With no oversight of these contractors, however, prisoner abuses again occurred, including malnutrition, overwork, and beatings that often resulted in injury and death. Finally, legislators adopted, for the first time in state history, a rudimentary parole process. Due to his extensive record of reforming the state prison system, Blackburn is considered "the father of prison reforms in Kentucky".
Blackburn was also a zealous advocate for improved river navigation. He persuaded the legislature to apply a $100,000 allocation from the U.S. Congress to the improvement of navigation along the <a href="Kentucky%20River">Kentucky River</a> and gave concurrent jurisdiction over the <a href="Big%20Sandy%20River%20%28Ohio%20River%29">Big Sandy</a> and <a href="Licking%20River%20%28Kentucky%29">Licking</a> Rivers to the federal government so they could be improved as well. Legislators also approved construction of a canal around the <a href="Cumberland%20Falls">Cumberland Falls</a> and improvements along the <a href="Tradewater%20River">Tradewater River</a>.

Blackburn's other accomplishments included establishing a state railroad commission and reorganizing the Kentucky Agricultural and Mechanical College. Kentucky A&M had been separated from Kentucky University under Blackburn's predecessor, <a href="James%20B.%20McCreary">James B. McCreary</a>; Blackburn now advocated that it be put under the control of and supported by the state. This was done, and the rechartered institution, located at Lexington, became known commonly as the State College; in 1916, it was renamed the <a href="University%20of%20Kentucky">University of Kentucky</a>.

Despite his record of reforms, Democratic party leaders were largely displeased with Blackburn and his administration. They decried his record number of pardons and resented the fact that he did not give more consideration to party service and loyalty when appointing individuals to state jobs. Further, state newspapers noted a lack of eloquence by the governor, and this provided additional fodder for Blackburn's critics. Having announced at the beginning of his term that he would seek no further political office, Blackburn nonetheless attempted to defend his record in a speech at the 1883 Democratic nominating convention, but boos and shouts for him to sit down almost drowned out the address. Finally, Blackburn responded to the heckling by saying he expected to be criticized for his reforms, but that anyone who charged his administration with corruption was a "liar—a base and infamous liar". At this, the clamor from the crowd became deafening, and Blackburn was forced to end his address and take his seat.
Blackburn retired from public life at the expiration of his term. He briefly visited a <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> resort before returning to his apartment at Louisville's Galt House and resuming his medical practice. While attending the 1883 National Conference of Charities, Blackburn was lauded for his prison reforms by guest speaker <a href="George%20Washington%20Cable">George Washington Cable</a>. He also received praise at a similar conference in <a href="Saratoga%2C%20New%20York">Saratoga, New York</a>, a few weeks later.

A few months after his return to Louisville, Blackburn opened a <a href="sanatorium">sanatorium</a> near <a href="Cave%20Hill%20Cemetery">Cave Hill Cemetery</a>. His failing health impeded the success of the endeavor, however, and in January 1887, he returned to the state capital of <a href="Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky">Frankfort</a>—a city he regarded as his home—knowing that death was near. After a prolonged illness, he became comatose and died September 14, 1887. He was buried in <a href="Frankfort%20Cemetery">Frankfort Cemetery</a>.

On May 27, 1891, the state erected a monument over Blackburn's grave. The granite monument features a <a href="bas-relief">bas-relief</a> depicting the <a href="Parable%20of%20the%20Good%20Samaritan">Parable of the Good Samaritan</a>. In 1972, the state opened the <a href="Blackburn%20Correctional%20Complex">Blackburn Correctional Complex</a>, a minimum security prison near Lexington named for Governor Blackburn.

Frank McNamara (RAAF officer)

<a href="Air%20Vice%20Marshal">Air Vice Marshal</a> Francis Hubert (Frank) McNamara, (4 April 1894 – 2 November 1961) was an <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20Victoria%20Cross%20recipients">Australian recipient</a> of the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>, the highest decoration for valour in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to a member of the British and <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> forces. Serving with the <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a>, he was honoured for his actions on 20 March 1917, when he rescued a fellow pilot who had been forced down behind enemy lines. McNamara was the first Australian aviator—and the only one in World War I—to receive the Victoria Cross. He later became a senior commander in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF).

Born and educated in <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, McNamara was a teacher when he joined the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">militia</a> prior to World War I. In 1915, he was selected for pilot training at <a href="Central%20Flying%20School%20RAAF">Central Flying School</a>, <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Point%20Cook%20Base">Point Cook</a>, and transferred to the Australian Flying Corps the following year. He was based in the <a href="Middle%20Eastern%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20I">Middle Eastern Theatre</a> with <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1 Squadron</a> when he earned the Victoria Cross. In 1921, McNamara enlisted as a <a href="flying%20officer">flying officer</a> in the newly formed RAAF, rising to the rank of air vice marshal by 1942. He held senior posts in England and <a href="Aden">Aden</a> during World War II. Retiring from the Air Force in 1946, McNamara continued to live in Britain until his death from heart failure in 1961.

Born in <a href="Rushworth%2C%20Victoria">Rushworth</a>, Victoria, McNamara was the first of eight children to William Francis McNamara, a State Lands Department officer, and his wife Rosanna. He began his schooling in Rushworth, and completed his secondary education at <a href="Shepparton%20High%20School">Shepparton Agricultural High School</a>, which he had entered via a scholarship. The family moved to <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> in 1910.

McNamara joined the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Cadets">school cadets</a> in 1911, and was <a href="officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">commissioned</a> a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in the 49th Battalion (Brighton Rifles), a <a href="Citizens%20Military%20Force">militia unit</a>, in July 1913. He became a teacher after graduating from Melbourne Teachers' Training College in 1914, and taught at various schools in Victoria. He also enrolled in the <a href="University%20of%20Melbourne">University of Melbourne</a>, but his studies were interrupted by the outbreak of World War I.

As a militia officer, McNamara was mobilised for service in Australia when war was declared in August 1914. After serving briefly at bases in <a href="Queenscliff%2C%20Victoria">Queenscliff</a> and <a href="Point%20Nepean%2C%20Victoria">Point Nepean</a>, Victoria, McNamara passed through Officers Training School at <a href="Broadmeadows%2C%20Victoria">Broadmeadows</a> in December. He began instructing at the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> Training Depot, Broadmeadows, in February 1915. Promoted to <a href="First%20Lieutenant">lieutenant</a> in July, he immediately volunteered for a military aeronautics course at <a href="Central%20Flying%20School%20RAAF">Central Flying School</a>, <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Point%20Cook%20Base">Point Cook</a>.

Selected for flying training at Point Cook in August 1915, McNamara made his first solo flight in a <a href="Bristol%20Boxkite">Bristol Boxkite</a> on 18 September, and graduated as a pilot in October. On 6 January 1916, he was assigned as <a href="adjutant">adjutant</a> to <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1 Squadron, Australian Flying Corps</a> (also known until 1918 as No. 67 Squadron, <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a>). In March, McNamara departed Melbourne for Egypt aboard HMAT "Orsova", arriving in <a href="Suez">Suez</a> the following month. He was seconded to <a href="No.%2042%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 42 Squadron RFC</a> in May to attend the <a href="Central%20Flying%20School">Central Flying School</a> at <a href="RAF%20Upavon">Upavon</a>, England; his secondment to the RFC was <a href="London%20Gazette">gazetted</a> on 5 July 1916.

Completing his course at Upavon, McNamara was posted back to Egypt in August, but was hospitalised on 8 September with <a href="orchitis">orchitis</a>. Discharged on 6 October, he served briefly as a <a href="Flight%20instructor">flying instructor</a> with <a href="No.%2022%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 22 Squadron RFC</a>, before returning to No. 1 Squadron. McNamara flew with C Flight, commanded by Captain (later Air Marshal Sir) <a href="Richard%20Williams%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Richard Williams</a>. On his first <a href="sortie">sortie</a>, a <a href="aerial%20reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> mission over <a href="Sinai%20Peninsula">Sinai</a>, McNamara was unaware that his plane had been hit by <a href="anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft fire</a>; he returned to base with his engine's oil supply almost exhausted. Flying <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20B.E.2">B.E.2</a>s and <a href="Martinsyde">Martinsyde</a>s, he undertook further scouting and bombing missions in the ensuing months.

On 20 March 1917, McNamara, flying a Martinsyde, was one of four No. 1 Squadron pilots taking part in a raid against a Turkish railway junction near <a href="Gaza%20City">Gaza</a>. Owing to a shortage of bombs, the aircraft were each armed with six specially modified 4.5-inch <a href="howitzer">howitzer</a> shells. McNamara had successfully dropped three of his shells when the fourth exploded prematurely, badly wounded him in the leg with <a href="Shrapnel%20shell">shrapnel</a>, an effect he likened to being "hit with a sledgehammer". Having turned to head back to base, he spotted a fellow squadron member from the same mission, Captain Douglas Rutherford, on the ground beside his crashlanded B.E.2. Allied airmen had been hacked to death by enemy troops in similar situations, and McNamara saw that a company of Turkish cavalry was fast approaching Rutherford's position. Despite the rough terrain and the gash in his leg, McNamara landed near Rutherford in an attempt to rescue him.

As there was no spare cockpit in the single-seat Martinsyde, the downed pilot jumped onto McNamara's wing and held the struts. McNamara crashed while attempting to take off because of the effects of his leg wound and Rutherford's weight overbalancing the aircraft. The two men, who had escaped further injury in the accident, set fire to the Martinsyde and dashed back to Rutherford's B.E.2. Rutherford repaired the engine while McNamara used his <a href="revolver">revolver</a> against the attacking cavalry, who had opened fire on them. Two other No. 1 Squadron pilots overhead, Lieutenant (later Air Marshal Sir) <a href="Peter%20Roy%20Maxwell%20Drummond">Roy "Peter" Drummond</a> and Lieutenant Alfred Ellis, also began strafing the enemy troops. McNamara managed to start the B.E.2's engine and take off, with Rutherford in the observer's cockpit. In severe pain and close to blacking out from loss of blood, McNamara flew the damaged aircraft back to base at <a href="Arish">El Arish</a>.
Having effected what was described in the <a href="Official%20History%20of%20Australia%20in%20the%20War%20of%201914%E2%80%931918">Australian official history of the war</a> as "a brilliant escape in the very nick of time and under hot fire", McNamara "could only emit exhausted expletives" before he lost consciousness shortly after landing. Evacuated to hospital, he almost died following an allergic reaction to a routine <a href="tetanus">tetanus</a> injection. McNamara had to be given <a href="artificial%20respiration">artificial respiration</a> and <a href="stimulant">stimulant</a>s to keep him alive, but recovered quickly. A contemporary news report declared that he was "soon sitting up, eating chicken and drinking champagne". On 26 March, McNamara was recommended for the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> by Brigadier General <a href="Geoffrey%20Salmond">Geoffrey Salmond</a>, <a href="General%20Officer%20Commanding">General Officer Commanding</a> Middle East Brigade, RFC. Drummond, Ellis, and Rutherford all wrote statements on 3–4 April attesting to their comrade's actions, Rutherford declaring that "the risk of Lieut. MacNamara being killed or captured was so great that even had he not been wounded he would have been justified in not attempting my rescue – the fact of his already being wounded makes his action one of outstanding gallantry – his determination and resource and utter disregard of danger throughout the operation was worthy of the highest praise". The first and only VC awarded to an Australian airman in World War I, McNamara's decoration was promulgated in the "<a href="London%20Gazette">London Gazette</a>" on 8 June 1917:

Promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28OF-2%29">captain</a> on 10 April 1917, McNamara became a <a href="Flight%20%28military%20unit%29">flight commander</a> in <a href="No.%204%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 4 Squadron AFC</a> (also known until 1918 as No. 71 Squadron RFC), but was unable to continue flying due to the leg wound he suffered on 20 March. He was invalided back to Australia in August aboard HT "Boorara", and given a hero's welcome on arrival in Melbourne. Found to be medically unfit for active service, McNamara was discharged from the <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a> on 31 January 1918. Panic caused by the intrusion into Australian waters of the German raider <a href="SMS%20Wolf%20%28auxiliary%20cruiser%29">"Wolf"</a> resulted in him being recalled to the AFC and put in charge of an aerial reconnaissance unit based in <a href="South%20Gippsland">South Gippsland</a>, Victoria, flying a <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20F.E.2">Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2</a>B and later a <a href="Farman%20MF.11">Maurice Farman Shorthorn</a>. In September 1918, he was posted as a flying instructor to Point Cook, where he saw out the remainder of the war.

Following the disbandment of the AFC, McNamara transferred to the <a href="Australian%20Air%20Corps">Australian Air Corps</a> (AAC) in April 1920. He was not offered an appointment in the AAC initially, however, and secured one only after Captain <a href="Elwyn%20Roy%20King">Roy King</a> protested the situation by giving up his own place in the new service in favour of McNamara, whom he described as "this very good and gallant officer". McNamara was <a href="Investiture">invested</a> with his Victoria Cross by the <a href="Edward%20VIII%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prince of Wales</a> at <a href="Government%20House%2C%20Melbourne">Government House, Melbourne</a>, on 26 May. He enlisted in the newly established <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) in 1921. Ranked <a href="flying%20officer">flying officer</a> (honorary <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a>), he was one of the original twenty-one officers on the Air Force's strength at its formation that March. Posted to RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne as Staff Officer Operations and Intelligence, McNamara was given command of <a href="No.%201%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 1 Flying Training School</a> (No. 1 FTS) at Point Cook in July 1922. He was promoted <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a> in March 1924 and the following month married Hélène Bluntschli, a Belgian national he had met in <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a> during the war, at <a href="St%20Patrick%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Melbourne">St Patrick's Cathedral</a>; his best man was fellow officer <a href="Frank%20Lukis">Frank Lukis</a>.

McNamara travelled to England in 1925 for two years exchange with the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>, serving at No. 5 Flying Training School, <a href="RAF%20Sealand">RAF Sealand</a>, and the Directorate of Training at the <a href="Air%20Ministry">Air Ministry</a>, London. Returning to Australia in November 1927, he was appointed Second-in-Command No. 1 FTS. In 1928, McNamara resumed his studies at the University of Melbourne, having earlier failed to pass the necessary exams to enter the <a href="RAF%20Staff%20College%2C%20Andover">RAF Staff College, Andover</a>. A part-time student at the university, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in International Relations (second-class honours) in 1933. McNamara became <a href="Commanding%20Officer">Commanding Officer</a> No. 1 FTS in October 1930, and was promoted to <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a> one year later. He was placed in charge of <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Laverton%20Base">RAAF Station Laverton</a>, Victoria, including <a href="No.%201%20Aircraft%20Depot%20RAAF">No. 1 Aircraft Depot</a>, in February 1933. McNamara was raised to <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a> in 1936, and attended the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Defence%20Studies">Imperial Defence College</a>, London, the following year. He was appointed a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (CBE) in the <a href="1938%20New%20Year%20Honours">1938 New Year Honours</a>.
When World War II broke out in September 1939, McNamara was serving as <a href="Air%20Liaison%20Officer">Air Liaison Officer</a> at <a href="High%20Commission%20of%20Australia%20in%20London">Australia House</a> in London, a position he had held since January 1938. Shortly before being promoted <a href="air%20commodore">air commodore</a> in December, he advocated establishing a reception base to act as a headquarters for the RAAF in England and "generally to watch the interests of Australian personnel" who were stationed there. By November 1940 he had reversed his position, in favour of an Air Ministry proposal to process personnel of all nationalities in one RAF base camp. In the event, <a href="RAAF%20Overseas%20Headquarters">RAAF Overseas Headquarters</a> was formed on 1 December 1941; Air Marshal <a href="Richard%20Williams%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Richard Williams</a> was appointed <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> (AOC) and McNamara Deputy AOC. McNamara became acting <a href="air%20vice%20marshal">air vice marshal</a> and acting AOC of RAAF Overseas Headquarters when Williams returned to Australia in January 1942 for what was expected to be a temporary visit; Williams was subsequently posted to Washington, D.C. and McNamara retained command of the headquarters until the end of the year.

McNamara was appointed AOC <a href="British%20Forces%20Aden">British Forces Aden</a> in late 1942, and arrived to take up the posting on 9 January 1943. Described in the <a href="Australia%20in%20the%20War%20of%201939-1945">official history of Australia in the war</a> as a "backwater", British Forces Aden's main functions were conducting <a href="Anti-submarine%20warfare">anti-submarine patrols</a> and escorting <a href="convoy">convoy</a>s. McNamara flew on these missions whenever he could, generally as an observer, but enemy contact was rare. He was appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> (CB) in the <a href="1945%20New%20Year%20Honours">1945 New Year Honours</a>, and returned to London in March. That month McNamara was deeply affected by the loss of his close friend Peter Drummond, who had helped keep attacking cavalry at bay during his Victoria Cross action in 1917. Drummond's <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">Consolidated B-24 Liberator</a> disappeared near the <a href="Azores">Azores</a> "en route" to Canada and all aboard were presumed killed; McNamara had to break the news to his widow, Isabel. McNamara's health had also suffered from exposure to the desert dust in Aden, and he was unable to take up his next position as the RAAF's representative at the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Defence</a> until September. His entire war was spent outside Australia.

McNamara was summarily retired from the RAAF in 1946, along with several other senior commanders and veterans of World War I, officially to make way for the advancement of younger and equally capable officers. His role overseas had in any case become redundant. He was discharged from the Air Force on 11 July. In May 1946, the British government offered McNamara the position of Senior Education Control Officer in <a href="Westphalia">Westphalia</a>, Germany, under the auspices of the <a href="Allied%20Control%20Council">Allied Control Commission</a>. He later became Deputy Director of Education for the <a href="Allied%20Occupation%20Zones%20in%20Germany">British Zone of Occupation</a>. McNamara continued to live in England after completing his work with the Commission in October 1947, and served on the <a href="National%20Coal%20Board">National Coal Board</a> in London from 1947 to 1959. He died of <a href="Hypertensive%20heart%20disease">hypertensive heart failure</a> on 2 November 1961, aged 67, after suffering a fall at his home in <a href="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a>. Survived by his wife and two children, he was buried at St Joseph's Priory, Austin Wood, <a href="Gerrards%20Cross">Gerrards Cross</a>, following a large funeral.

Embittered by his dismissal from the RAAF and the meagre <a href="Severance%20package">severance</a> he received from the Australian Government, McNamara insisted that his Victoria Cross not be returned to Australia after his death; his family donated it to the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force%20Museum">RAF Museum</a>, London. A fellow No. 1 Squadron pilot, Lieutenant (later Air Vice Marshal) <a href="Adrian%20Cole%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Adrian Cole</a>, described McNamara as "quiet, scholarly, loyal and beloved by all ... the last Officer for whom that high honour would have been predicted". He was one of the few Victoria Cross recipients to subsequently attain senior rank in the armed services, though RAAF historian Alan Stephens considered that his appointments were "in the main routine" and that his one great deed led to "a degree of fame that he perhaps found burdensome". Biographer Chris Coulthard-Clark summed up McNamara's "dilemma" as that of "an essentially ordinary man" thrust into the limelight by one "truly amazing episode". His name is borne by Frank McNamara Park in <a href="Shepparton%2C%20Victoria">Shepparton</a>, Victoria, and the Frank McNamara VC Club at <a href="Oakey%20Army%20Aviation%20Centre">Oakey Army Aviation Centre</a>, Queensland.

Albert Ball

Albert Ball, (14 August 1896 – 7 May 1917) was an English <a href="fighter%20pilot">fighter pilot</a> during the First World War. At the time of his death he was the United Kingdom's leading <a href="flying%20ace">flying ace</a>, with 44 victories, and remained its fourth-highest scorer behind <a href="Mick%20Mannock">Edward Mannock</a>, <a href="James%20McCudden">James McCudden</a>, and <a href="George%20McElroy">George McElroy</a>.

Born and raised in <a href="Nottingham">Nottingham</a>, Ball joined the <a href="Sherwood%20Foresters">Sherwood Foresters</a> at the outbreak of the First World War and was commissioned as a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in October 1914. He transferred to the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> (RFC) the following year, and gained his pilot's <a href="Aircrew%20brevet">wings</a> on 26 January 1916. Joining <a href="No.%2013%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 13 Squadron RFC</a> in France, he flew reconnaissance missions before being posted in May to <a href="No.%2011%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 11 Squadron</a>, a fighter unit. From then until his return to England on leave in October, he accrued many aerial victories, earning two <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a>s and the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a>. He was the first ace to become a British national hero.

After a period on home establishment, Ball was posted to <a href="No.%2056%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 56 Squadron</a>, which deployed to the Western Front in April 1917. He crashed to his death in a field in France on 7 May, sparking a wave of national mourning and posthumous recognition, which included the award of the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> for his actions during his final tour of duty. The famous German flying ace <a href="Manfred%20von%20Richthofen">Manfred von Richthofen</a>, remarked upon hearing of Ball's death that he was "by far the best English flying man".

Albert Ball was born on 14 August 1896 at a house on Lenton Boulevard in <a href="Lenton%2C%20Nottingham">Lenton, Nottingham</a>. After a series of moves throughout the area, his family settled at "Sedgley" in Lenton Road. His parents were <a href="Albert%20Ball%20%28politician%29">Albert Ball</a>, a successful businessman who rose from employment as a plumber to become <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20Nottingham">Lord Mayor of Nottingham</a>, and who was later <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighted</a>, and Harriett Mary Page. Young Albert had two siblings, a brother and a sister. His parents were considered loving and indulgent. In his youth, Ball had a small hut behind the family house where he tinkered with engines and electrical equipment. He was raised with a knowledge of firearms, and conducted target practice in "Sedgley"'s gardens. Possessed of keen vision, he soon became a crack shot. He was also deeply religious. This did not curb his daring in such boyhood pursuits as <a href="steeplejack">steeplejack</a>ing; on his 16th birthday, he accompanied a local workman to the top of a tall factory chimney and strolled about unconcerned by the height.

Ball studied at the Lenton Church School, <a href="The%20King%27s%20School%2C%20Grantham">The King's School, Grantham</a> and <a href="Nottingham%20High%20School">Nottingham High School</a> before transferring to <a href="Trent%20College">Trent College</a> in January 1911, at the age of 14. As a student he displayed only average ability, but was able to develop his curiosity for things mechanical. His best subjects were carpentry, modelling, violin and photography. He also served in the <a href="Officers%27%20Training%20Corps">Officers' Training Corps</a>. When Albert left school in December 1913, aged 17, his father helped him gain employment at Universal Engineering Works near the family home.

Following the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Ball enlisted in the British Army, joining the <a href="Robin%20Hood%20Battalion">2/7th (Robin Hood) Battalion</a> of the <a href="Sherwood%20Foresters">Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment)</a>. Soon promoted to <a href="sergeant">sergeant</a>, he gained his commission as a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> on 29 October. He was assigned to training recruits, but this rear-echelon role irked him. In an attempt to see action, he transferred early the following year to the North Midlands Cyclist Company, Divisional Mounted Troops, but remained confined to a posting in England. On 24 February 1915, he wrote to his parents, "I have just sent five boys to France, and I hear that they will be in the firing line on Monday. It is just my luck to be unable to go."

In March 1915, Ball began a short-lived engagement to Dorothy (Dot) Elbourne. In June, he decided to take private flying lessons at <a href="Hendon%20Aerodrome">Hendon Aerodrome</a>, which would give him an outlet for his interest in engineering and possibly help him to see action in France sooner. He paid to undertake pilot training in his own time at the Ruffy-Baumann School, which charged £75 to £100 for instruction (£5,580 to £7,440 in 2010 prices).

Ball would wake at 3:00 am to ride his motorcycle to Ruffy-Baumann for flying practice at dawn, before beginning his daily military duty at 6:45 am. His training at Ruffy-Baumann was not unique; <a href="Edwin%20Cole%20%28RAF%20officer%29">Edwin Cole</a> was learning to fly there at the same time. In letters home Ball recorded that he found flying "great sport", and displayed what <a href="Peter%20de%20la%20Billi%C3%A8re">Peter de la Billière</a> described as "almost brutal" detachment regarding accidents suffered by his fellow trainees:

Although considered an average pilot at best by his instructors, Ball qualified for his <a href="Royal%20Aero%20Club">Royal Aero Club</a> certificate (no. 1898) on 15 October 1915, and promptly requested transfer to the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> (RFC). He was seconded to <a href="No.%209%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 9 (Reserve) Squadron RFC</a> on 23 October, and trained at <a href="RAF%20Mousehold%20Heath">Mousehold Heath</a> aerodrome near <a href="Norwich">Norwich</a>. In the first week of December, he soloed in a <a href="Farman%20MF.7">Maurice Farman "Longhorn"</a> after standing duty all night, and his touchdown was rough. When his instructor commented sarcastically on the landing, Ball angrily exclaimed that he had only 15 minutes experience in the plane, and that if this was the best instruction he was going to get, he would rather return to his old unit. The instructor relented, and Ball then soloed again and landed successfully in five consecutive flights. His rough landing was not the last Ball was involved in; he survived two others. He completed his training at <a href="Central%20Flying%20School">Central Flying School</a>, Upavon, and was awarded his <a href="Aircrew%20brevet">wings</a> on 22 January 1916. A week later, he was officially transferred from the North Midlands Cyclist Company to the RFC as a pilot.

On 18 February 1916, Ball joined <a href="No.%2013%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 13 Squadron RFC</a> at <a href="Marieux">Marieux</a> in France, flying a two-seat <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20B.E.2">Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2</a>c on reconnaissance missions. He survived being shot down by anti-aircraft fire on 27 March. Three days later, he fought the first of several combats in the B.E.2; he and his observer, Lieutenant S. A. Villiers, fired a <a href="Drum%20magazine">drum</a> and a half of <a href="Lewis%20gun">Lewis gun</a> ammunition at an enemy two-seater, but were driven off by a second one. After this inconclusive skirmish, Ball wrote home in one of his many letters, "I like this job, but nerves do not last long, and you soon want a rest". In letters home to his father, he discouraged the idea of his younger brother following him into the RFC. Ball and Villiers tried unsuccessfully to shoot down an enemy observation balloon in their two-seater on 10 April. Ball's burgeoning skills and aggressiveness gained him access to the squadron's single-seat <a href="Bristol%20Scout">Bristol Scout</a> fighter later that month. April 1916 also saw Ball's first mention in a letter home of plans for "a most wonderful machine ... heaps better than the Hun Fokker". It is now generally believed that these "plans" were unconnected with the design of the <a href="Austin-Ball%20A.F.B.1">Austin-Ball A.F.B.1</a>, with which he later became involved.

On 7 May 1916, Ball was posted to <a href="No.%2011%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 11 Squadron</a>, which operated a mix of fighters including Bristol Scouts, <a href="Nieuport%2016">Nieuport 16</a>s, and <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20F.E.2">Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2</a>b <a href="pusher%20configuration">"pushers"</a>. After his first day of flying with his new unit, he wrote a letter home complaining about fatigue. He was unhappy with the hygiene of his assigned billet in the nearest village, and elected to live in a tent on the flight line. Ball built a hut for himself to replace the tent and cultivated a garden.

Throughout his flying service Ball was primarily a "lone-wolf" pilot, stalking his prey from below until he drew close enough to use his top-wing Lewis gun on its <a href="Foster%20mounting">Foster mounting</a>, angled to fire upwards into the enemy's fuselage. According to fellow ace and <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> recipient <a href="James%20McCudden">James McCudden</a>, "it was quite a work of art to pull this gun down and shoot upwards, and at the same time manage one's machine accurately". Ball was as much a loner on the ground as in the air, preferring to stay in his hut on the flight line away from other squadron members. His off-duty hours were spent tending his small garden and practising the violin. Though not unsociable per se, he was extremely sensitive and shy. Ball acted as his own mechanic on his aircraft and, as a consequence, was often untidy and dishevelled. His singularity in dress extended to his habit of flying without a helmet and goggles, and he wore his thick black hair longer than regulations generally permitted.

While flying a Bristol Scout on 16 May 1916, Ball scored his first aerial victory, driving down a German reconnaissance aircraft. He then switched to Nieuports, bringing down two <a href="LVG">LVG</a>s on 29 May and a <a href="Fokker%20Eindecker">Fokker Eindecker</a> on 1 June. On 25 June he became a <a href="balloon%20buster">balloon buster</a> and an <a href="Flying%20ace">ace</a> by destroying an observation balloon with <a href="phosphor">phosphor</a> bombs. During the month he had written to his parents admonishing them to try and "take it well" if he was killed, "for men tons better than I go in hundreds every day". He again achieved two victories in one <a href="sortie">sortie</a> on 2 July, shooting down a <a href="LFG%20Roland%20C.II">Roland C.II</a> and an <a href="Aviatik">Aviatik</a> to bring his score to seven.

Ball then requested a few days off but, to his dismay, was temporarily reassigned to aerial reconnaissance duty with <a href="No.%208%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 8 Squadron</a>, where he flew B.E.2s from 18 July until 14 August. During this posting, Ball undertook an unusual mission. On the evening of 28 July, he flew a French <a href="field%20agent">espionage agent</a> across enemy lines. Dodging an attack by three German fighters, as well as anti-aircraft fire, he landed in a deserted field, only to find that the agent refused to get out of the aircraft. While he was on reconnaissance duties with No. 8 Squadron, the "<a href="London%20Gazette">London Gazette</a>" announced that he had been awarded the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a> "for conspicuous skill and gallantry on many occasions," particularly for "one occasion [when] he attacked six in one flight". This was not unusual; throughout his career, Ball generally attacked on sight and heedless of the odds. He professed no hatred for his opponents, writing to his parents "I only scrap because it is my duty ... Nothing makes me feel more rotten than to see them go down, but you see it is either them or me, so I must do my duty best to make it a case of "them"".
Ball's 20th birthday was marked by his promotion to temporary captain and his return to No. 11 Squadron. He destroyed three Roland C.IIs in one sortie on 22 August 1916, the first RFC pilot to do so. He ended the day by fighting 14 Germans some behind their lines. With his aircraft badly damaged and out of fuel, he struggled back to Allied lines to land. He transferred with part of No. 11 Squadron to <a href="No.%2060%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 60 Squadron RFC</a> on 23 August. His new commanding officer gave Ball a free rein to fly solo missions, and assigned him his own personal aircraft and maintenance crew. One of the squadron mechanics painted up a non-standard red propeller boss; A201 became the first of a series of Ball's aeroplanes to have such a colour scheme. He found that it helped his fellow squadron members identify his aircraft and confirm his combat claims. By end of the month, he had increased his tally to 17 enemy aircraft, including three on 28 August.

Ball then took leave in England. His feats in France had received considerable publicity. He was the first British ace to become a household name, and found that his celebrity was such that he could not walk down the streets of Nottingham without being stopped and congratulated. Prior to this the British government had suppressed the names of its aces—in contrast to the policy of the French and Germans—but the losses of the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme">Battle of the Somme</a>, which had commenced in July, made politic the publicising of its successes in the air. Ball's achievements had a profound impact on budding flyer <a href="Mick%20Mannock">Mick Mannock</a>, who would become the United Kingdom's top-scoring ace and also receive the Victoria Cross.

Upon return to No. 60 Squadron in France, Ball scored morning and evening victories on 15 September, flying two different Nieuports. On the evening mission, he armed his aircraft with eight <a href="Le%20Prieur%20rocket">Le Prieur rocket</a>s, fitted to the outer struts and designed to fire electrically. He intended to use them on an observation balloon. As it happened, he spotted three German Roland C.IIs and broke their formation by <a href="salvo">salvo</a>ing his rockets at them, then picked off one of the pilots with machine-gun fire. After this he settled into an improved aeroplane, <a href="Nieuport%2017">Nieuport 17</a> A213. He had it rigged to fly tail-heavy to facilitate his changing of ammunition drums in the machine-gun, and had a holster built into the cockpit for the <a href="M1911%20pistol">Colt automatic pistol</a> that he habitually carried. Three times during September he scored triple victories in a day, ending the month with his total score standing at 31, making him Britain's top-scoring ace. By this time he had told his commanding officer that he had to have a rest and that he was taking unnecessary risks because of his nerves. On 3 October, he was sent on leave, en route to a posting at the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps%23Home%20defence">Home Establishment</a> in England. A French semi-official report of Ball's successes was issued the same day; it was picked up and repeated in the British aviation journal "<a href="Flight%20International">Flight</a>" nine days later.

Ball had been awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> (DSO) and <a href="Medal%20bar">bar</a> simultaneously on 26 September 1916. The first award was "for conspicuous gallantry and skill" when he took on two enemy formations. The bar was also "for conspicuous skill and gallantry" when he attacked four enemy aircraft in formation and then, on another occasion, 12 enemy machines. He was awarded the Russian <a href="Order%20of%20St.%20George">Order of St. George</a> the same month. Now that Ball had been posted back to England, he was lionised as a national hero with a reputation as a fearless pilot and expert marksman. A crowd of journalists awaited him on his family's doorstep. In an interview, he mentioned being downed six times in combat. On 18 November, he was invested with his Military Cross and both DSOs by King <a href="George%20V">George V</a> at <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a>. A second bar to the DSO, for taking on three enemy aircraft and shooting one down, followed on 25 November, making him the first three-time recipient of the award. Ball was promoted to the <a href="substantive%20rank">substantive rank</a> of <a href="Lieutenant%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29">lieutenant</a> on 8 December 1916.
Instead of returning to combat after his leave, Ball was posted to instructional duties with <a href="No.%2034%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 34 (Reserve) Squadron RFC</a>, based at <a href="Orford%20Ness">Orford Ness</a>, Suffolk. About this time he was debriefed by flying instructor <a href="Philip%20Gribble">Philip Gribble</a>, who was charged with discovering the tactics of ace fighter pilots; Gribble decided Ball operated on "paramount courage and a bit of luck". Ball asked Gribble to let him try a Bristol Scout, which he landed badly, seriously damaging the undercarriage; Ball asked for another machine to try again, with the same result, after which he consoled himself by eating "seven pounds of chocolate". It was while serving on the home front that he was able to lobby for the building and testing of the Austin-Ball A.F.B.1 fighter. He hoped to be able to take an example of the type to France with him, but the prototype was not completed until after his death in action. In November he was invited to test fly the prototype of the new <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20S.E.5">Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5</a> single-seat <a href="Scout%20%28aircraft%29">scout</a>, apparently the first service pilot to do so. He was unimpressed, finding the heavier, more stable fighter less responsive to the controls than the Nieuports he was used to. His negative assessment of other aspects of the S.E.'s performance, on the other hand, contrasted markedly with the reactions of fellow pilots who tested the prototype about this time. Ball was to maintain his opinion of the S.E. as a "dud", at least until he had scored several victories on the type after his return to France.

On 19 February 1917, in a tribute from his native city, Ball became an <a href="Freedom%20of%20the%20city">Honorary Freeman</a> of Nottingham. Around this time he met James McCudden, also on leave, who later reported his impressions in most favourable terms. In London, Ball also encountered Canadian pilot <a href="Billy%20Bishop">Billy Bishop</a>, who had not as yet seen combat. He immediately liked Bishop, and may have helped the latter secure a posting to No. 60 Squadron. On 25 March, while off-duty, Ball met 18-year-old Flora Young. He invited her to fly with him, and she accepted, wearing a leather flying coat that they had borrowed. On 5 April, they became engaged; she wore his silver identification wrist bracelet in lieu of an engagement ring.

Inaction chafed Ball, and he began agitating for a return to combat duty. He finally managed to obtain a posting as a <a href="Flight%20commander%20%28position%29">flight commander</a> with <a href="No.%2056%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 56 Squadron RFC</a>, considered to be as close to an elite unit as any established by the RFC. Ball was still first among Britain's aces, and some documents hint that his attachment to No. 56 Squadron was planned to be temporary. According to one account he had been slated to serve with the unit for only a month to mentor novice pilots.

The latest type from the Royal Aircraft Factory, the S.E.5, had been selected to equip the new squadron. This choice was viewed with some trepidation by the RFC high command, and Ball himself was personally far from happy with the S.E.5. After some intense lobbying he was allowed to retain his Nieuport 17 no. B1522 when the unit went to France; the Nieuport was for his solo missions, and he would fly an S.E.5 on patrols with the rest of the squadron. This arrangement had the personal approval of General <a href="Hugh%20Trenchard%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Trenchard">Hugh Trenchard</a>, who went on to become the first <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Air%20Staff%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>. No. 56 Squadron moved to the Western Front on 7 April 1917. On arrival Ball wrote to his parents, "Cheero, am just about to start the great game again".

S.E.5 no. A4850, fresh from its packing crate, was extensively modified for Ball: in particular he had the <a href="Synchronization%20gear">synchronised</a> <a href="Vickers%20machine%20gun">Vickers machine gun</a> removed, to be replaced with a second Lewis gun fitted to fire downwards through the floor of the cockpit. He also had a slightly larger fuel tank installed. On 9 April, A4850 was refitted, and the downward-firing Lewis gun removed and replaced by the normal Vickers gun mounting. In a letter to Flora Young on 18 April, Ball mentioned getting his own hut on the flight line, and installing the members of his flight nearby.

On 23 April 1917, Ball was under strict orders to stay over British lines, but still engaged the Germans five times in his Nieuport. In his first combat that day, using his preferred belly shot, he sent an Albatros into a spin, following it down and continuing to fire at it until it struck the ground. It was No. 56 Squadron's first victory. Regaining an altitude of , he tried to dive underneath an Albatros two-seater and pop up under its belly as usual, but he overshot, and the German rear gunner put a burst of 15 bullets through the Nieuport's wings and spars. Ball coaxed the Nieuport home for repairs, returning to battle in an S.E.5. In his third combat of the day, he fired five rounds before his machine gun jammed. After landing to clear the gun, he took off once more, surprising five Albatros fighters and sending one down in flames. His fifth battle, shortly thereafter, appeared inconclusive, as the enemy plane managed to land safely. However, its observer had been mortally wounded.

Three days later, on 26 April, Ball scored another double victory, flying S.E.5 no. A4850, and one more on 28 April. This last day's fighting left the S.E.5 so battered by enemy action that it was dismantled and sent away for repair. The following month, despite continual problems with jamming guns in the S.E.5s, Ball shot down seven Albatroses in five days, including two reconnaissance models on 1 May, a reconnaissance plane and an <a href="Albatros%20D.III">Albatros D.III</a> fighter on 2 May; a D.III on 4 May, and two D.IIIs the next day, 5 May. The second of these victims nearly rammed Ball as they shot it out in a head-on firing pass. As they sped past one another, Ball was left temporarily blinded by oil spraying from the holed oil tank of his craft. Clearing the oil from his eyes, he flew his S.E.5 home with zero oil pressure in an engine on the brink of seizure. He was so overwrought that it was some time after landing before he could finish thanking God, then dictating his combat report.

While squadron armourers and mechanics repaired the faulty machine-gun <a href="Synchronization%20gear%23The%20Constantinesco%20synchronization%20gear">synchroniser</a> on his most recent S.E.5 mount, A8898, Ball had been sporadically flying the Nieuport again, and was successful with it on 6  May, destroying one more Albatros D.III in an evening flight to raise his tally to 44. He had continued to undertake his habitual lone patrols, but had of late been fortunate to survive. The heavier battle damage that Ball's aircraft were now suffering bore witness to the improved team tactics being developed by his German opponents. Some time on 6 May, Ball had visited his friend Billy Bishop at the latter's aerodrome. He proposed that the pair attack the <a href="Manfred%20von%20Richthofen">Red Baron</a>'s squadron at its airfield at dawn, catching the German pilots off guard. Bishop agreed to take part in the daring scheme at the end of the month, after he returned from his forthcoming leave. That night, in his last letter to his father, Ball wrote "I do get tired of always living to kill, and am really beginning to feel like a murderer. Shall be so pleased when I have finished".

On the evening of 7 May 1917, near <a href="Douai">Douai</a>, 11 British aircraft from No. 56 Squadron led by Ball in an S.E.5 encountered German fighters from "<a href="Jasta%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B11">Jasta 11</a>". A running dogfight in deteriorating visibility resulted, and the aircraft became scattered. <a href="Cecil%20Arthur%20Lewis">Cecil Arthur Lewis</a>, a participant in this fight, described it in his memoir "Sagittarius Rising". Ball was last seen by fellow pilots pursuing the red Albatros D.III of the Red Baron's younger brother, <a href="Lothar%20von%20Richthofen">Lothar von Richthofen</a>, who eventually landed near <a href="Ann%C5%93ullin">Annœullin</a> with a punctured fuel tank. <a href="Cyril%20Crowe">Cyril Crowe</a> observed Ball flying into a dark thundercloud. A German pilot officer on the ground, Lieutenant Hailer, then saw Ball's plane falling upside-down from the bottom of the cloud, at an altitude of , with a dead prop.

Brothers Franz and Carl Hailer and the other two men in their party were from a German reconnaissance unit, "Flieger-Abteilung A292". Franz Hailer noted, "It was leaving a cloud of black smoke... caused by oil leaking into the cylinders." The engine had to be inverted for this to happen. The Hispano engine was known to flood its <a href="inlet%20manifold">inlet manifold</a> with fuel when upside down and then stop running. Franz Hailer and his three companions hurried to the crash site. Ball was already dead when they arrived. The four German airmen agreed that the crashed craft had suffered no battle damage. No bullet wounds were found on Ball's body, even though Hailer went through Ball's clothing to find identification. Hailer also took Ball to a field hospital. A German doctor subsequently described a broken back and a crushed chest, along with fractured limbs, as the cause of death.
The Germans credited Richthofen with shooting down Ball, but there is some doubt as to what happened, especially as Richthofen's claim was for a <a href="Sopwith%20Triplane">Sopwith Triplane</a>, not an S.E.5, which was a biplane. Given the amount of propaganda the German High Command generated touting the younger Richthofen, a high-level decision may have been taken to attribute Ball's death to him. It is probable that Ball was not shot down at all, but had become disoriented and lost control during his final combat, the victim of a form of temporary <a href="vertigo">vertigo</a> that has claimed other pilots. Ball's squadron harboured hopes that he was a prisoner of war, and the British government officially listed him as "missing" on 18 May. There was much speculation in the press; in France, the <a href="Havas">Havas</a> news agency reported: "Albert Ball, the star of aviators... has been missing since the 7th May. Is he a prisoner or has he been killed? If he is dead, he died fighting for his forty-fifth victory." It was only at the end of the month that the Germans dropped messages behind Allied lines announcing that Ball was dead, and had been buried in Annoeullin with full military honours two days after he crashed. Over the grave of the man they dubbed "the English Richthofen", the Germans erected a cross bearing the inscription "In Luftkampf gefallen für sein Vaterland Engl. Flieger Hauptmann Albert Ball, Royal Flying Corps" ("Fallen in air combat for his fatherland English pilot Captain Albert Ball").

Ball's death was reported worldwide in the press. He was lauded as the "wonder boy of the Flying Corps" in Britain's "<a href="Sunday%20Dispatch">Weekly Dispatch</a>", the "Ace of English Aces" in Portugal, the ""heroe aviador"" in South America, and the "super-airman" in France. On 7 June 1917, the "London Gazette" announced that he had received the Croix de Chevalier, "<a href="Legion%20d%27Honneur">Legion d'Honneur</a>" from the French government. The following day, he was awarded the Victoria Cross for his "most conspicuous and consistent bravery" in action from 25 April to 6 May 1917. On 10 June 1917, a memorial service was held for Ball in the centre of Nottingham at <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Church%2C%20Nottingham">St Mary's Church</a>, with large crowds paying tribute as the procession of mourners passed by. Among those attending were Ball's father Albert, Sr. and brother Cyril, now also a pilot in the RFC; his mother Harriett, overwhelmed with grief, was not present. Ball was posthumously promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29">captain</a> on 15 June. His Victoria Cross was presented to his parents by King George V on 22 July 1917. The following year he was awarded a special medal by the Aero Club of America.

In 1918, Walter A. Briscoe and H. Russell Stannard released a seminal biography, "Captain Ball VC", reprinting many of Ball's letters and prefaced with <a href="encomium">encomium</a>s by Prime Minister <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a>, Field Marshal <a href="Douglas%20Haig%2C%201st%20Earl%20Haig">Sir Douglas Haig</a>, and Major General Sir Hugh Trenchard. Lloyd George wrote that "What he says in one of his letters, 'I hate this game, but it is the only thing one must do just now', represents, I believe, the conviction of those vast armies who, realising what is at stake, have risked all and endured all that liberty may be saved". Haig spoke of Ball's "unrivalled courage" and his "example and incentive to those who have taken up his work". In Trenchard's opinion, Ball had "a wonderfully well-balanced brain, and his loss to the Flying Corps was the greatest loss it could sustain at that time".

In the book proper, Briscoe and Stannard quote Ball's most notable opponent, <a href="Manfred%20von%20Richthofen">Manfred von Richthofen</a>. The Red Baron, who believed in his younger brother's victory award, considered Ball "by far the best English flying man". Elsewhere in the book, an unidentified Royal Flying Corps pilot who flew with Ball in his last engagement was quoted as saying, "I see they have given him the V.C. Of course he won it a dozen times over—the whole squadron knows that." The authors themselves described the story of Ball's life as that of "a young knight of gentle manner who learnt to fly and to kill at a time when all the world was killing... saddened by the great tragedy that had come into the world and made him a terrible instrument of Death".

Linda Raine Robertson, in "The Dream of Civilised Warfare", noted that Briscoe and Stannard emphasised "the portrait of a boy of energy, pluck, and humility, a loner who placed his skill in the service of his nation, fought – indeed, invited – a personal war, and paid the ultimate sacrifice as a result", and that they "struggle to paste the mask of cheerful boyishness over the signs of the toll taken on him by the stress of air combat and the loss of friends".

<a href="Alan%20Clark">Alan Clark</a>, in "Aces High: The War in the Air Over the Western Front", found Ball the "perfect <a href="Independent%20school%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">public schoolboy</a>" with "the enthusiasms and all the eager intelligence of that breed" and that these characteristics, coupled with a lack of worldly maturity, were "the ingredients of a perfect killer, where a smooth transition can be made between the motives that drive a boy to 'play hard' at school and then to 'fight hard' against the King's enemies". Biographer Chaz Bowyer considered that "to label Albert Ball a 'killer' would be to do him a grave injustice", as his "sensitive nature suffered in immediate retrospect whenever he succeeded in combat".

After the war the British discovered Ball's grave, which had been behind enemy lines, in the Annoeullin Cemetery. In December 1918, personnel of <a href="No.%20207%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 207 Squadron RAF</a> erected a new cross in place of the one left by the Germans. The Imperial War Graves Commission (now <a href="Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission">Commonwealth War Graves Commission</a>) were working at the time to consolidate the British war graves into fewer cemeteries; 23 British bodies in graves in the location where Ball was buried were moved to the Cabaret Rouge British Cemetery, but at his father's request Ball's grave was allowed to remain. Albert Sr. paid for a private memorial to be erected over Ball's grave, No. 643, in what later became the Annoeullin Communal Cemetery and German Extension. Ball's is the only British grave from the First World War in this extension, the rest being German. Ball's father also bought the French field where his son had died and erected a memorial stone on the crash site.

Memorials to Ball in his native Nottingham include a <a href="Statue%20of%20Captain%20Albert%20Ball">monument and statue</a> in the grounds of <a href="Nottingham%20Castle">Nottingham Castle</a>. The monument, which was commissioned by the city council and funded by public subscription, consists of a bronze group on a carved pedestal of Portland stone and granite. The bronze group, by the sculptor <a href="Henry%20Poole%20%28sculptor%29">Henry Poole</a>, shows a life-size figure of Ball with an allegorical female figure at his shoulder. The monument was unveiled on 8 September 1921 by <a href="Air%20Marshal">Air Marshal</a> Trenchard, with military honours including a flypast by a squadron of RAF aircraft. In 1929 the bronze model for Ball's statue was presented by his father to the <a href="National%20Portrait%20Gallery%2C%20London">National Portrait Gallery</a> in London, where it is on display. In further remembrance of his son, Albert Ball, Sr. commissioned the building of the <a href="Albert%20Ball%20Memorial%20Homes">Albert Ball Memorial Homes</a> in Lenton to house the families of local servicemen killed in action. The Lenton War Memorial, located in front of the homes, includes Ball's name and was also paid for by the Ball family. The homes were <a href="Listed%20building">Grade-II</a> listed for historic preservation in 1995.
A memorial to Ball, along with his parents, and a sister who died in infancy, appears on the exterior wall of the southwest corner of <a href="Holy%20Trinity%20Church%2C%20Lenton">Holy Trinity Church</a> in Lenton. Another memorial tablet is present inside the same church, mounted on the north wall and bearing the RFC and RAF motto "<a href="Per%20Ardua%20ad%20Astra">Per Ardua ad Astra</a>", along with decorations of medals and royal arms. In 1967, the Albert Ball VC Scholarships were instituted at his alma mater, Trent College. A propeller from one of Ball's aircraft and the original cross from his grave in France are displayed at the college's library and chapel, respectively. One of the houses at Nottingham High's Junior School is also named after Ball.

In 2006, Ball was one of six recipients of the Victoria Cross to be featured on a special commemorative edition of <a href="Royal%20Mail">Royal Mail</a> stamps marking the 150th anniversary of the award. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Nottingham Castle Museum along with his other medals and memorabilia, including a bullet-holed Avro windshield, a section of engine piping from one of his damaged Nieuports, his Freedom of Nottingham Scroll and Casket, and various letters and other papers. A portrait study by <a href="Noel%20Denholm%20Davis">Noel Denholm Davis</a> is in the collection of Nottingham City Museums and Galleries.

Halo 3

Halo 3 is a 2007 <a href="first-person%20shooter">first-person shooter</a> video game developed by <a href="Bungie">Bungie</a> for the <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> console. The third installment in the <a href="Halo%20%28series%29">"Halo" franchise</a>, the game concludes the <a href="story%20arc">story arc</a> begun in 2001's "" and continued in 2004's "<a href="Halo%202">Halo 2</a>". The game was released on September 25, 2007, in Australia, Brazil, India, New Zealand, North America, and Singapore; September 26, 2007, in Europe; and September 27, 2007, in Japan. "Halo 3"s story centers on the interstellar war between twenty-sixth century humanity, a collection of alien races known as the <a href="Covenant%20%28Halo%29">Covenant</a>, and the alien parasite <a href="Flood%20%28Halo%29">Flood</a>. The player assumes the role of the <a href="Master%20Chief%20%28Halo%29">Master Chief</a>, a cybernetically enhanced supersoldier, as he battles the Covenant and the Flood. The game features vehicles, weapons, and gameplay elements not present in previous titles of the series, as well as the addition of saved gameplay films, file sharing, and the Forge map editor—a utility which allows the player to perform modifications to multiplayer levels.

Bungie began developing "Halo 3" shortly after "Halo 2" shipped. The game was officially announced at <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">E3</a> 2006, and its release was preceded by a multiplayer beta open to select players who purchased the Xbox 360 game "<a href="Crackdown">Crackdown</a>". Microsoft spent $40 million on marketing the game, in an effort to sell more game consoles and broaden the appeal of the game beyond the established "Halo" fanbase. Marketing included cross-promotions and an <a href="alternate%20reality%20game">alternate reality game</a>.

On the day before its official release, 4.2 million units of "Halo 3" were in retail outlets. "Halo 3" grossed US$300 million in its first week. More than one million people played "Halo 3" on <a href="Xbox%20Live">Xbox Live</a> in the first twenty hours. To date, "Halo 3" has sold in excess of 14.5 million copies, making it the fifth best selling Xbox 360 game of all time, the best selling Xbox 360 exclusive title and the best selling first person shooter on the console outside of the "Call of Duty" games. The game was also the <a href="2007%20in%20video%20gaming%23United%20States">best-selling video game of 2007 in the U.S.</a> Overall, the game was very well received by critics, with the Forge and <a href="multiplayer">multiplayer</a> offerings singled out as strong features; however some reviewers criticized single-player aspects, especially the plot and campaign layout. A prequel to the game, "", was released worldwide on September 22, 2009. A sequel, "<a href="Halo%204">Halo 4</a>", released on November 6, 2012, was developed by <a href="343%20Industries">343 Industries</a> and grossed $220 million on its launch day. "Halo 3" was re-released as part of "" for the <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a> on November 11, 2014. The said collection will be released for the <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> in 2019.

"Halo 3" is a <a href="shooter%20game">shooter game</a> where players primarily experience gameplay from a first-person perspective. Much of the gameplay takes place on foot, but also includes segments focused on <a href="vehicle">vehicular</a> combat. The balance of weapons and objects in the game was adjusted to better adhere to the "Golden Triangle of "Halo"": these are weapons, grenades, and melee attacks, which are available to a player in most situations. Players may <a href="dual%20wield">dual-wield</a> some weapons, forgoing the use of grenades and melee attacks in favor of the combined firepower of two weapons. Many weapons available in previous installments of the series return with minor cosmetic and power alterations. Unlike previous installments, the player's secondary weapon is visible on their player model, holstered or slung across the player's back.

"Halo 3" introduces "support weapons", which are cumbersome two-handed weapons that slow the player, but offer greatly increased firepower in return. In addition to weapons, the game contains a new class of gear called equipment; these items have various effects, ranging from defensive screens to shield regeneration and flares. Only one piece of equipment can be carried at a time. The game's vehicular component has been expanded with new drivable and <a href="Game%20artificial%20intelligence">AI</a>-only vehicles.

"Halo 3" contains non-gameplay additions, such as Forge, a map-editing tool. Forge enables players to insert and remove game objects, such as weapons, crates and vehicles into existing multiplayer maps. Almost all weapons, vehicles, and interactive objects can be placed and moved on maps with Forge. Players can enter Forge games and edit and manipulate objects in real time. A budget limits the number of objects that can be placed. Players may also save up to 100 films of gameplay to their Xbox 360's hard drive, viewing the action from any angle and at different speeds. "Halo 3" offers a form of file sharing, where items such as saved films, screenshots, and custom variants can all be uploaded to Bungie's official website. Anyone can browse user created content that has been uploaded to Bungie's website and tag it to automatically download to their console next time they sign into Xbox Live on "Halo 3".

"Halo 3"s story or campaign mode can be played through alone or <a href="cooperative%20gameplay">cooperatively</a> with up to three other players via <a href="Xbox%20Live">Xbox Live</a> or <a href="System%20Link">System Link</a>. Instead of having each player be an identical character as in previous "Halo" games, the first player plays as <a href="Master%20Chief%20%28Halo%29">Master Chief</a>, and the second player plays as the <a href="Arbiter%20%28Halo%29">Arbiter</a>. The other two players control two <a href="Covenant%20Elite">Covenant Elite</a>s, N'tho 'Sraom and Usze 'Taham, each with their own backstories. No matter which character is played, each player has identical abilities, though their starting weapons vary. Hidden skulls found on each level cause changes to the gameplay when enabled, such as giving the enemies extra health, changing in-game dialogue, or modifying AI behavior. These skulls, as well as the difficulty level and the speed at which the level is completed, provide multipliers to the total score. Players are awarded <a href="gamerscore">gamerscore</a> points for unlocking <a href="Achievement%20%28video%20gaming%29">Achievements</a> by reaching a certain score in each level.

<a href="Local%20area%20network">Local area network</a> or Xbox Live supports up to sixteen players in multiplayer matches, with game modes including variations of <a href="deathmatch%20%28gaming%29">deathmatch</a> and <a href="Capture%20the%20flag%20%28video%20games%29">Capture the Flag</a>. Players must actively seek out other players through their Xbox Live Friends list, using the party invite system, or the LAN search feature to play multiplayer matches with their own custom rules and customized maps. If they are connected to Xbox Live however, a player can choose to have the game decide for them the exact rules and map to play on, as well as finding additional people to play against or with, using the "Matchmaking" system (the automated grouping of players of similar skill). A player will decide from a selection of developer designed "playlists" which each contain a certain way to experience the game.

Like other multiplayer Xbox 360 titles, "Halo 3" uses a customized version of <a href="TrueSkill">TrueSkill</a> ranking system for its matchmaking on a per-playlist basis. A linear measure of a player's experience with the matchmade portion of the game and each particular playlist is also tracked (denoted as <a href="Experience%20point">EXP</a>). To help players have an enjoyable time online, several peace-of-mind features are implemented within easy reach, such as avoid/feedback options on a player's service record, as well as voice chat mute straight from the in-game scoreboard. Like "Halo 2", "Halo 3" supports downloadable content and updates.

"Halo 3" is set in a science fiction setting during the years 2552 and 2553. In the year 2525, a theocratic alliance of alien races known as the <a href="Covenant%20%28Halo%29">Covenant</a> discover humanity spread across dozens of interstellar colonies. The Covenant declare humanity an affront to their gods and begin destroying colonies by bombarding the planets with barrages of plasma, turning their surfaces into glass. Despite efforts to keep the Covenant from finding further human worlds, a Covenant fleet discovers Earth during "<a href="Halo%202">Halo 2</a>".

"<a href="Halo%20%28megastructure%29">Halos</a>" are massive ringworlds, ranging from thousands to tens of thousands of kilometers in diameter, scattered across the galaxy. These rings were constructed thousands of years ago by a race known as the <a href="Forerunner%20%28Halo%29">Forerunners</a> as weapons of last resort against the parasitic alien species known as the <a href="Flood%20%28Halo%29">Flood</a>. When activated, the Halos would destroy all <a href="sentience">sentient</a> life in the galaxy, depriving the Flood of its food. The Forerunners disappeared after they activated the rings. In "", whilst fleeing the Covenant, the UNSC ship "Pillar of Autumn" stumbled upon one of these ringworlds, <a href="Installation%2004">Installation 04</a>. The humans manage to destroy the ring, stopping the Flood; the Covenant, unaware of the destructive nature of the rings, attempt to fire another ring, <a href="Installation%2005">Installation 05</a>, during "Halo 2" in order to fulfill their religious prophecy. One race in the Covenant, the Elites, learn the truth about the rings, and join forces with humanity in order to stop the firing of the ring. Though they are successful, the unexpected shutdown of the installation triggers a fail-safe protocol, priming all the rings for firing from one location, referred to as the <a href="The%20Ark%20%28Halo%29">Ark</a>. Still oblivious to the true nature of the rings, the Covenant <a href="High%20Prophet%20of%20Truth">High Prophet of Truth</a> and the remaining loyalist Covenant proceed to head to Earth, where they believe the Ark is buried.

"Halo 3"s protagonist is Master Chief Petty Officer John-117, a surgically enhanced supersoldier known as a "<a href="Spartan-II">Spartan</a>". The Chief fights alongside the Arbiter, a disgraced Covenant Elite commander. Two other Elite characters, N'tho 'Sraom and Usze 'Taham, appear as the third and fourth players in cooperative play. Supporting characters from previous games return, including human soldiers <a href="Avery%20J.%20Johnson">Avery Johnson</a> and <a href="Miranda%20Keyes">Miranda Keyes</a>. The Forerunner artificial intelligence <a href="343%20Guilty%20Spark">343 Guilty Spark</a>, who tries and fails to stop the Master Chief from destroying its ringworld in "Halo: Combat Evolved", also makes an appearance. Also playing a role in the story is the Flood entity known as the "<a href="Gravemind">Gravemind</a>". In "Halo 2", this leader of the Flood escapes from confinement on Installation 05, invades the Covenant mobile capital city of "High Charity", and captures <a href="Cortana%20%28Halo%29">Cortana</a>, a human-created artificial intelligence.

After the events of the comic tie-in "", the Master Chief crashes in eastern Africa, where he is found by Johnson and the Arbiter. The Chief and company arrive at a UNSC outpost where Keyes and <a href="Characters%20of%20Halo%23Terrance%20Hood">Lord Hood</a> plan a final effort to stop the Covenant leader, the High Prophet of Truth, from activating a Forerunner artifact uncovered outside the ruins of the city of New Mombasa. The Chief clears anti-air Covenant defenses so Hood can lead the last of Earth's ships against the Prophet, but Truth activates the buried artifact, creating a <a href="slipspace">slipspace</a> portal which he and his followers enter. A Flood-infested ship crash-lands nearby; Elite forces arrive and vitrify the Flood-infected areas of Earth, stopping the threat. Following a message Cortana left aboard the Flood ship, the Chief, Arbiter, Elites, Johnson, Keyes and their troops follow Truth through the portal. Joining them is 343 Guilty Spark, who aids the Chief as he has no function to fulfill after the destruction of his ringworld.

Traveling through the portal, the humans and Elites discover an immense artificial structure known as the Ark, far beyond the edges of the Milky Way galaxy. Here, Truth can remotely activate all the Halos. The Flood arrive aboard "High Charity" in full force, beginning to infest the installation. Truth captures Johnson, as he needs a human to use Forerunner technology. Keyes is killed attempting a rescue, and Johnson is forced to activate the rings. Gravemind forges a truce with the Chief and Arbiter to stop Truth and defeat the remainder of his army, rescuing Johnson and halting the installations' activation. After the Arbiter kills Truth, Gravemind turns on the Chief and Arbiter.

The Chief, Arbiter and Guilty Spark discover that the Ark is constructing another Halo to replace the one that the Chief previously destroyed. The Chief decides to activate this Halo; the ringworld would eliminate the Flood infestation on the Ark while sparing the galaxy at large from destruction. To activate the ring, the Chief rescues Cortana, who has the Activation Index of the destroyed Halo, from "High Charity" and destroys the city. Arriving on the new Halo, Cortana warns that Gravemind is trying to rebuild itself on the ring. The Chief, Arbiter, and Johnson travel to Halo's control room to activate the ring. Guilty Spark explains that because the ring is not yet complete, a premature activation will destroy it and the Ark. When Johnson ignores his warning, Guilty Spark fatally wounds him to protect "his" ring. Although the Chief destroys Guilty Spark, Johnson soon dies of his injuries. Chief activates the ring, and escapes the ring's self-destruction on the UNSC frigate "Forward Unto Dawn". However, the force of Halo's blast causes the slipspace portal to collapse, resulting in only the front half of "Forward Unto Dawn", carrying the Arbiter, making it back to Earth.

A memorial service is held on Earth for the fallen heroes of the Human-Covenant war, during which the Arbiter and Lord Hood briefly exchange words regarding the fallen Master Chief. After the memorial service, the Arbiter and his Elite brethren depart for their home planet, Sanghelios. Meanwhile, the rear half of the "Forward Unto Dawn" drifts in unknown space. Cortana drops a distress beacon, but acknowledges it may be many years before they are rescued. As the Master Chief enters <a href="cryonics">cryonic sleep</a>, Cortana confides to him that she will miss him, but he comforts her by telling her "wake me when you need me." If the game is completed at the Legendary difficulty level, the scene continues to show the piece of "Forward Unto Dawn" drifting towards an unknown planet, revealed in the sequel to be known as "Requiem", the primary setting of the campaign of "<a href="Halo%204">Halo 4</a>".

"Halo 3" was initially conceived before "Halo 2" was released in 2004. Much of the staff were preoccupied in making extra content for "Halo 2", while others continued with the groundwork for the development of "Halo 3". Bungie remained quiet as to what their new project was, leaving comments in their weekly update alluding to a "new project". The game was officially announced with a <a href="Real-time%20computing">real-time</a> <a href="Cutscene">cinematic</a> <a href="film%20trailer">trailer</a> at <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">E3</a> 2006.

Bungie kept the public informed on game development via weekly updates on their web site. During development, the game was divided into single player and multiplayer <a href="Software%20build">builds</a>; this made debugging and testing the much smaller multiplayer files quicker. While details of "Halo 3"s multiplayer were widely disseminated in the sixteen months leading up to the release, the single-player aspect of the storyline was kept relatively secret throughout much of the development to build up interest. The first campaign screenshots did not appear until a year after the announcement trailer, on July 5, 2007, as a "tease" for the planned pace of marketing.

A public <a href="beta%20test">beta test</a> of the game's online multiplayer features, as well as saved films and file share, took place four months before the full release. Players required a "<a href="Crackdown">Crackdown</a>" disc to play the beta.

AI behavior was enhanced and improved; the behavior of enemy <a href="Brutes%20%28Halo%29%23Brutes%20%28Jiralhanae%29">Brutes</a> the player faces was modified, giving them a "<a href="Herd%20behavior">pack mentality</a>" that causes the aliens to perform similar actions at the same time and altering gameplay.

"Halo 3" utilizes a proprietary, in-house <a href="Game%20engine">graphics engine</a>. As detailed on the Bungie website, it employs advanced graphics technologies such as <a href="High-dynamic-range%20rendering">high dynamic range</a>, global lighting and <a href="depth%20of%20field">depth of field</a> effects within cutscenes. <a href="Motion%20blur">Motion blur</a>ring was absent from the beta, but was added to the final game. Most of the dynamic objects in the game cast real-time shadows on themselves and the environment around them, including the game's plant life. "Halo 3" uses <a href="normal%20mapping">normal</a>, <a href="bump%20mapping">bump</a>, and <a href="parallax%20mapping">parallax mapping</a> to give surfaces more detail without dramatically increasing the number of polygons. Players can see distances of up to away, all fully three-dimensional. Real time reflections were written into the engine; however, they are often unused as Bungie considered it a waste of resources.

"Halo 3" does not natively render at true <a href="High-definition%20video">HD</a> resolution (at least 720 lines of vertical resolution). In a Bungie Weekly Update, it was confirmed that the game renders at 1152×640 resolution instead of the usual 1280×720 (HD) resolution that most <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> games use. This is because "Halo 3" uses two frame buffers instead of the usual one, so the lower resolution allowed Bungie to preserve as much of the dynamic range as possible for the game's lighting without adversely affecting the frame rate. The image can be upscaled to <a href="1080p">1080p</a> by the Xbox 360.

As with all titles on the Xbox 360, "Halo 3" fully supports <a href="Surround%20sound">5.1 surround sound</a> audio. In the game, there are over 50,000 pieces of audio, with nearly 40,000 of those being NPC dialogue. This is far more than in either of the preceding "Halo" titles; "Halo 2" had over 15,000 pieces of dialogue. The AI controlling this dialogue is designed to ensure the exchanges flow naturally and convincingly. Separate recordings were made for nearby and distant gunfire to make for a more believable sound experience in the public beta, and the finished game uses <a href="Waves%20Audio">Waves Audio</a> plugins to modify dialog and other audio in-game depending on conditions. Distant gunfire sounds, which may first seem like pre-recorded ambient sound, may often be the result of an actual firefight happening elsewhere in the game.

<a href="Martin%20O%27Donnell">Marty O'Donnell</a> again composed the original score for the game. Some pieces of the game's music are produced with a much larger real orchestra than any pieces in the prior two games. For example, the music for the announcement trailer was recorded with a 60-piece orchestra and a 24-piece <a href="choir">choir</a>. "Halo 3" is the first game in the series to feature custom soundtracks, allowing players to replace in-game music with their own choices. The "<a href="Halo%203%20Original%20Soundtrack">Halo 3 Original Soundtrack</a>" was released on November 20, 2007. Included on the soundtrack is an original composition submitted by fans and judged by Nile Rodgers, Michael Ostin, and Marty O'Donnell.

Voice actors returning to reprise their roles in "Halo 3" include <a href="Jen%20Taylor">Jen Taylor</a> as Cortana, <a href="David%20Scully%20%28actor%29">David Scully</a> as Sergeant Johnson and the Elites, <a href="Keith%20David">Keith David</a> as the Arbiter, <a href="Tim%20Dadabo">Tim Dadabo</a> as 343 Guilty Spark, <a href="Ron%20Perlman">Ron Perlman</a> as Lord Hood, <a href="Robert%20Davi">Robert Davi</a> as Rtas 'Vadum, and <a href="Steve%20Downes">Steve Downes</a> as the voice of Master Chief. The game also features new voices, with <a href="Terence%20Stamp">Terence Stamp</a> and <a href="Justis%20Bolding">Justis Bolding</a> replacing "Halo 2" voice actors <a href="Michael%20Wincott">Michael Wincott</a> and <a href="Julie%20Benz">Julie Benz</a> as the <a href="Prophet%20of%20Truth">Prophet of Truth</a> and <a href="List%20of%20Halo%20characters">Miranda Keyes</a> respectively. Additional voices include celebrity presenter <a href="Jonathan%20Ross">Jonathan Ross</a>, <a href="Nathan%20Fillion">Nathan Fillion</a>, <a href="Adam%20Baldwin">Adam Baldwin</a>, <a href="Alan%20Tudyk">Alan Tudyk</a>, <a href="Katee%20Sackhoff">Katee Sackhoff</a>, and <a href="John%20DiMaggio">John DiMaggio</a>. Members of the "Halo" <a href="machinima">machinima</a> "<a href="Red%20vs.%20Blue">Red vs. Blue</a>" (<a href="Burnie%20Burns">Burnie Burns</a>, <a href="Gus%20Sorola">Gus Sorola</a>, <a href="Matt%20Hullum">Matt Hullum</a>, <a href="Jason%20Salda%C3%B1a">Jason Saldaña</a>, <a href="Geoff%20Ramsey">Geoff Ramsey</a>, and <a href="Joel%20Heyman">Joel Heyman</a>) have a <a href="cameo%20appearance">cameo</a> role.

Months before the release of "Halo 3", the game's final testing copy before its gold release—codenamed Epsilon and confirmed by Bungie to be almost complete—was <a href="Internet%20leak">leaked to the Internet</a>. Microsoft reacted to this leak by having the Xbox Live accounts of gamers caught playing the Epsilon copy banned until the year 9999. Two weeks before "Halo 3" was due to be released, full retail copies of the game complete with photographs of the open game box started to appear on the internet auction site <a href="eBay">eBay</a>. A week before "Halo 3" was due for release, major UK catalog retailer <a href="Argos%20%28retailer%29">Argos</a> accidentally released some of their final retail copies of "Halo 3". Microsoft's Entertainment and Devices division were quoted as being "disappointed that it happened" but that "it was just an honest mistake" and that Microsoft had no intention of punishing Argos for the error.

"Halo 3"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s final retail copy was leaked online over a week before its official release. The 6.14 <a href="gigabyte">gigabyte</a> file of the game was <a href="ripping">ripped</a> and downloaded by "thousands" of people within 24 hours of the leak. Videos of the ending of "Halo 3", obtained from the leaked copy, were captured and posted on <a href="video%20hosting%20service">video sharing sites</a>.

Microsoft spent more than $40 million marketing "Halo 3". The goal of the campaign was to sell more Xbox 360 consoles and widen the appeal of the game beyond the ""Halo" faithful" to casual as well as hardcore gamers. Marketing took the form of stages, including trailers of the game, real-time cinematics, recorded gameplay sequences, pre-rendered <a href="Computer-generated%20imagery">CGI</a>, and <a href="live%20action">live action</a> film. On September 12, 2007, the "Believe" "Halo 3" ad campaign, focused on the epic nature of the story and heroism told through <a href="diorama">diorama</a>s and third party accounts of Master Chief's service, began with the video "Museum" and continued on past the game's release.

Throughout the course of development Bungie released four "developer documentaries" that explained the processes behind creating parts of the game. A large-scale multiplayer beta test was played on Xbox Live with more than 800 000 members of the public being able to take part and experience the game for themselves. Beginning in June 2007, an <a href="alternate%20reality%20game">alternate reality game</a> called <a href="Iris%20%28game%29">"Iris"</a> involved players in slowly revealing background information for the game. The actual release was met with worldwide launch parties.

"Halo 3" also had marketing tie-ins and promotions. <a href="PepsiCo">PepsiCo</a> announced a new line of soft drink, a variant of <a href="Mountain%20Dew">Mountain Dew</a> named Game Fuel, branded with the "Halo 3" logo and the Master Chief. Much of the advertising focused on appealing to the general public, rather than just hardcore fans of the game; for example, some <a href="7-Eleven">7-Eleven</a> stores advertised "Halo 3" and sold specialty cups and copies of the game.
"Halo 3" was released in three separate retail versions, branded as "Standard", "Limited" and "Legendary" editions. The Standard Edition contains the game disc, manual, and a small poster with the game's control-map and artwork. The Limited Edition, contained in a metal case, contains the game disc, manual, poster, Xbox 360 bonus disc with featurettes, and a hardcover-bound "Bestiarum", a collection of information and art covering the species, cultures, and civilizations of "Halo 3". The Legendary Edition contains the game disc, manual, poster, interactive bonus disc, the Bestiarum on a DVD, Legendary DVD containing exclusive content, and a scale replica of the Master Chief's helmet as a case for the three discs. The slip-cover packaging unfolds into a large heavy-stock poster of Master Chief. <a href="Gamestation">Gamestation</a> stores in the UK offered a limited edition Master Chief figurine to the first 1000 preorders.

Upon release, some of the Limited Edition versions of "Halo 3" were found to have a defect in the hub that kept the discs in place, which could lead to scratched discs. Microsoft confirmed the problem and offered to replace scratched "Halo 3" Limited Edition discs free of charge until the end of January 2008. This was not a problem in either the Legendary Edition or the Standard Edition.

During October 16–31, 2013, "Halo 3" was available as a free download for Xbox Live Gold subscribers.

In September 2017 (exactly a decade after the release of the game), Halo 3 became available on the <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a> via <a href="backwards%20compatibility">backwards compatibility</a>.
"Halo 3" supports multiplayer map downloadable content as well as game updates via Xbox Live. The first three post-release multiplayer maps, "Standoff", "Rat's Nest", and "Foundry", were released as a pack on December 11, 2007, collectively known as the "Heroic Map Pack". A second group of three maps including a remake of "Halo 2" map "Lockout", titled "Blackout", a new map "Ghost Town" and a remake of "Halo: Combat Evolved" map "Sidewinder", titled "Avalanche" were bundled as the "Legendary Map Pack", on April 15, 2008. These maps introduced visual filters to the Forge pallet, which change the way the maps look. A remake of the "Halo: Combat Evolved" map "Chill Out", titled "Cold Storage", was released as a free download on "Bungie Day", July 7, 2008. The third multiplayer map pack, titled the "Mythic Map Pack" and consisting of the maps "Orbital", "Assembly", and "Sandbox", was included with the Limited Collectors Edition of "<a href="Halo%20Wars">Halo Wars</a>". The map pack was released over the Xbox Live Marketplace on April 9, 2009. The fourth and final multiplayer map pack,"Mythic II Map Pack", was released on February 2, 2010. The map pack includes the three new maps from "": "Citadel", "Longshore", and a remake of "Halo 2" map "Midship", titled "Heretic".

The first version update for "Halo 3" was released on February 19, 2008, and addressed various bugs such as melee contest resolution and saved-film theater errors. The next update (called a Title Update) was released September 23, 2008, and includes new Achievements, a new XP ranking system, and various new ways to detect and stop cheating in the game. No further "Halo 3" updates were planned.

"Halo 3" received critical acclaim upon its release. It holds an average of 94/100 on aggregate website <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>. "<a href="Pro-G">Pro-G</a>"s Wesley Yin-Poole assured readers that "Halo 3" lived up to the enormous hype surrounding it, writing that the game was "everything we hoped it would be, and much, much, more". Reviewers including "<a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>"s Rob Fahey, <a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a>'s Charlie Barrett, and <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>'s <a href="Jeff%20Gerstmann">Jeff Gerstmann</a> felt that the underlying formula of previous "Halo" games was unchanged, but that this was not a detriment. "Every type of Halo fan, from the hardcore to the casual to the brand new, will find something to satisfy them in Master Chief's third adventure," Barrett asserted, while IGN's Hilary Goldstein referred to "Halo 3" as "the most complete game available on any console", specifically stating "the Forge and the replay functionality raise the bar for console shooters so high, it may never be surpassed this generation." The gameplay additions to the game, such as equipment and new vehicles, were praised; Gerstmann and Goldstein noted that equipment had much more relevance in multiplayer matches than the campaign.

Reception of the single-player aspect varied. Yin-Poole wrote that while the <a href="cliffhanger">cliffhanger</a> ending of "Halo 2" was disappointing, the campaign of "Halo 3" was much more satisfying. Gerstmann, <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>'s Gabe Graziani, and Goldstein maintained that the campaign was too short, especially on easier difficulty levels or with three additional players in co-op. Goldstein was highly critical of the eighth level, stating "the penultimate chapter is so bad, just thinking about it puts a rotten taste in my mouth." "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" Charles Herold said the game had a "throwaway" plot and Total Video Games judged the single-player aspect ultimately disappointing. Goldstein and Steve West of Cinema Blend thought a part of the game's story was lost by not having the Arbiter featuring as prominently as the character was in "Halo 2".

Most publications agreed that multiplayer was by far one of the best features; IGN said that the multiplayer map lineup was the strongest of the series, and GameSpy added that "each [multiplayer] map is extremely well-tuned". The Forge level editor and saved films features were singled out as particularly strong features, in addition to superb voice acting and Martin O'Donnell's rich score.

Other complaints focused on the artificial intelligence; critics praised the enemy AI but complained that the intelligence of the player's allies was far poorer. Bryan Vore of "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" said that human faces and some textures were just "embarrassing".

"Halo 3" was nominated for seven awards from the <a href="Spike%20TV">Spike TV Awards</a>, of which it won "Best Multiplayer Game" and "Most Addictive Video Game Fueled by Dew". It won "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>"s "Game of the Year" and <a href="IGN">IGN</a> chose it as the Best Xbox 360 Online Multiplayer Game and Innovative Design of 2007. The <a href="Visual%20Effects%20Society">Visual Effects Society</a> awarded Bungie the "Best Real Time Visuals in a Video Game" for "Halo 3". "Halo 3" took the "Calvin Award" for "Best Videogame" as selected by <a href="Box%20Office%20Prophets">Box Office Prophets</a>. "Halo 3" also took the award for Xbox 360 Game of the Year 2007 from <a href="GameTrailers">GameTrailers</a>, and was voted by fans as Game of the Year on <a href="G-Phoria">G-Phoria</a>. "Halo 3" won the "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" Award For Interactive Innovation in August 2008. In 2010, the game was included as one of the titles in the book "<a href="1001%20Video%20Games%20You%20Must%20Play%20Before%20You%20Die">1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die</a>".

First-day sales of "Halo 3" reached $170 million in the U.S., setting a record for highest gross of an entertainment product within 24 hours of its release. The performance beat the previous record setter—"Halo 2"—which earned $125 million within 24 hours after its launch. The game was preordered by more than one million people in North America. Worldwide more than US$300 million worth were sold in the first week, helping to more than double the sales of the Xbox 360 when compared with the weekly average before the "Halo 3" launch.

In the U.S., "Halo 3" sold 3.3 million copies in its first 12 days on sale, increasing to 3.7 million copies by November 15, 2007. <a href="Reuters">Reuters</a> UK estimated that "Halo 3" may have sold up to 5.2 million copies worldwide in the first two weeks after launch. By November 30, 2007, "Halo 3" had sold 5 million copies worldwide, and as of that point, was the <a href="2007%20in%20video%20gaming%23United%20States">best-selling video game of 2007 in the U.S.</a>, even though the game is only available on one console. On January 3, 2008, Microsoft announced that "Halo 3" has sold 8.1 million copies. The game drew over a million Xbox Live members to play online in the first 20 hours, making it the biggest day for Xbox Live gaming in history. The game returned to the top 20 sales charts more than a year after its release in February 2009; Gamasutra reported that the boost might have been due to the release of "Halo Wars". By January 2008, 8.1 million copies had been sold. According to Microsoft, "Halo 3" had sold 14.5 million copies .

"Advertising Age" reported that movie studio executives were convinced the release of "Halo 3" harmed box office receipts; the week's take was 27% less than the previous year's yield. While some executives decided the disparity in estimated and actual gross for films like "<a href="The%20Heartbreak%20Kid%20%282007%20film%29">The Heartbreak Kid</a>" was due more to the film's poor reception, other analysts believed that "the audience on ["Halo 3"] is the 18-to-34 demographic, similar to what you'd see in cinemas" and that this led to a decrease in receipts. Later research suggested that the "Halo 3" players still watched the same amount of television and movies, regardless of the time they spent playing the game.

History of the Yosemite area

Human habitation in the <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20%28U.S.%29">Sierra Nevada</a> region of California reaches back 8,000 to 10,000 years ago. Historically attested <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> populations, such as the <a href="Plains%20and%20Sierra%20Miwok">Sierra Miwok</a>, <a href="Mono%20tribe">Mono</a> and <a href="Northern%20Paiute">Paiute</a>, belong to the <a href="Uto-Aztecan">Uto-Aztecan</a> and <a href="Utian">Utian</a> phyla.

In the mid-19th century, a band of Native Americans called the <a href="Ahwahnechee">Ahwahnechee</a> lived in <a href="Yosemite%20Valley">Yosemite Valley</a>. The <a href="California%20Gold%20Rush">California Gold Rush</a> greatly increased the number of non-indigenous people in the region. Tensions between Native Americans and <a href="European%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">white settlers</a> escalated into the <a href="Mariposa%20War">Mariposa War</a>. As part of this conflict, settler James Savage led the <a href="Mariposa%20Battalion">Mariposa Battalion</a> into Yosemite Valley in 1851, in pursuit of Ahwaneechees led by <a href="Chief%20Tenaya">Chief Tenaya</a>. Accounts from the battalion, especially from Dr. <a href="Lafayette%20Bunnell">Lafayette Bunnell</a>, popularized Yosemite Valley as a scenic wonder.

In 1864, Yosemite Valley and the <a href="Mariposa%20Grove">Mariposa Grove</a> of <a href="giant%20sequoia">giant sequoia</a> trees were transferred from federal to state ownership. Yosemite pioneer <a href="Galen%20Clark">Galen Clark</a> became the park's first guardian. Conditions in Yosemite Valley were made more hospitable to people and access to the park was improved in the late 19th century. Naturalist <a href="John%20Muir">John Muir</a> and others became increasingly alarmed about the excessive exploitation of the area. Their efforts helped establish Yosemite National Park in 1890. Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove were added to the national park in 1906.

The <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> had jurisdiction over the national park from 1891 to 1914, followed by a brief period of civilian stewardship. The newly formed <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> took over the park's administration in 1916. Improvements to the park helped to increase visitation during this time. Preservationists led by Muir and the <a href="Sierra%20Club">Sierra Club</a> failed to save <a href="Hetch%20Hetchy%20Valley">Hetch Hetchy Valley</a> from becoming a reservoir in 1923. In 1964, 89 percent of the park was set aside in a highly protected <a href="wilderness%20area">wilderness area</a>, and other protected areas were added adjacent to the park. The once-famous "<a href="Yosemite%20Firefall">Yosemite Firefall</a>", created by pushing red hot embers off a cliff near <a href="Glacier%20Point">Glacier Point</a> at night, was discontinued in the mid-to-late 20th century along with other activities that were deemed to be inconsistent with protection of the national park.

Humans may have visited the Yosemite area as long as 8,000 to 10,000 years ago. 
Habitation of the <a href="Yosemite%20Valley">Yosemite Valley</a> proper can be traced to about 3,000 years ago, when vegetation and game in the region was similar to that present today; the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada had acorns, deer, and salmon, while the eastern Sierra had pinyon nuts and <a href="obsidian">obsidian</a>. <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> groups traveled between these two regions to trade and raid.
Archaeologists divide the pre-European American contact period of the region into three cultural phases. The Crane Flat phase lasted from 1000 BCE to 500 CE and is marked by hunting with the <a href="atl%20atl">atl atl</a> and the use of <a href="grinding%20stone">grinding stone</a>s. The Tarmarack phase lasted from 500 until 1200, marked by a shift to using smaller rock points, indicating development and use of the <a href="bow%20and%20arrow">bow and arrow</a>. The Mariposa phase lasted from 1200 until contact with European Americans.

Trade between tribes became more widespread during the Mariposa phase, and the diet continued to improve. <a href="Northern%20Paiute">Paiute</a>s, <a href="Miwok">Miwok</a>, and <a href="Mono%20%28tribe%29">Mono</a>s visited the area to trade; one major trading route went over <a href="Mono%20Pass">Mono Pass</a> and through <a href="Bloody%20Canyon">Bloody Canyon</a> to <a href="Mono%20Lake">Mono Lake</a> in Eastern California.

<a href="Northern%20Paiute">Paiutes</a> were the primary inhabitants of the Yosemite area and the foothills to the east during the Mariposa and historic phases. The Central Sierra Miwoks lived along the drainage area of the <a href="Tuolumne%20River">Tuolumne</a> and <a href="Stanislaus%20River">Stanislaus River</a>s, while the Paiutes inhabited the upper drainage of the <a href="Merced%20River">Merced</a> and <a href="Chowchilla%20River">Chowchilla River</a>s.

The indigenous natives called themselves the <a href="Ahwahnechee">Ah-wah-ne-chee</a>, meaning "dwellers in Ahwahnee." The Ahwahneechees were decimated by a disease in about 1800, and left the valley, although about 200 returned under the leadership of <a href="Tenaya">Tenaya</a>, son of an Ahwahneechee chief.

Displaced Native Americans from the Californian coast moved to the Sierra Nevada during the early-to-mid-19th century, bringing with them their knowledge of <a href="Cuisine%20of%20Spain">Spanish food</a>, technology, and clothing. Joining forces with the other tribes in the area, they raided <a href="Ranchos%20of%20California">land grant ranchos</a> on the coast and drove herds of horses to the Sierra, where horse meat became a major new food source.

Although there were <a href="Spanish%20missions%20in%20California">Spanish missions</a>, "<a href="pueblo">pueblo</a>s" (towns), "<a href="presidio">presidio</a>s" (forts), and "<a href="Ranchos%20of%20California">ranchos</a>" along the coast of California, no Spanish explorers visited the Sierra Nevada. The first European Americans to visit the mountains were amongst a group led by fur trapper <a href="Jedediah%20Smith">Jedediah Smith</a>, crossing north of the Yosemite area in May 1827, at <a href="Ebbetts%20Pass">Ebbetts Pass</a>.
A group of trappers led by mountain man <a href="Joseph%20Reddeford%20Walker">Joseph Reddeford Walker</a> may have seen Yosemite Valley in the autumn of 1833. Walker approached a valley rim as he led his party across the Sierra Nevada, but he did not enter it. A member of the group, Zenas Leonard, wrote in his journal that streams from the valley rim dropped "from one lofty precipice to another, until they are exhausted in rain below. Some of these precipices appeared to us to be more than a mile high." The Walker party probably visited either the <a href="Tuolumne%20Grove">Tuolumne</a> or <a href="Merced%20Grove">Merced Grove</a>s of <a href="giant%20sequoia">giant sequoia</a>, becoming the first non-indigenous people to see the giant trees, but journals relating to the Walker party were destroyed in 1839, in a print shop fire in Philadelphia.

The part of the Sierra Nevada where the park is located was long considered to be a physical barrier to European American settlers, traders, trappers, and travelers. That situation changed in 1848 after gold was discovered in the foothills west of the range. Travel and trade activity dramatically increased in the area during the ensuing <a href="California%20Gold%20Rush">California Gold Rush</a>. Resources depended upon by local Native Americans were depleted or destroyed, and disease brought by the newcomers spread rapidly through indigenous populations. Extermination of native culture became a policy of the United States Government.

The first confirmed sighting of Yosemite Valley by a non-indigenous person occurred on October 18, 1849 by William P. Abrams and a companion. Abrams accurately described some landmarks, but it is uncertain whether he or his companion actually entered the valley. In 1850, one of three brothers, Joseph, William, or Nathan Screech, became the first confirmed non-indigenous person to enter <a href="Hetch%20Hetchy%20Valley">Hetch Hetchy Valley</a>. Joseph Screech returned two years later and spoke with the Native Americans living there, asking them what the name of a grass-covered seed meal was and was told, "hatch hatchy."

The surveying crew of Allexey W. Von Schmidt conducted the first systematic traverse of any part of the Yosemite area backcountry in 1855, when it extended an approximation of the Mount Diablo Baseline eastward from a point west of the present park boundary, to a point south of Mono Lake. The actual route taken was 5 to 6 miles south of the actual baseline, due to topographic difficulties, including the Tuolumne River canyon at low elevations, and steep mountain slopes higher up. Nevertheless, this was the first straight line survey made across the Sierra Nevada From 1879 to 1883 large parts of the western half of the park were surveyed as part of the General Land Office survey. However, the individual contracted for the largest area, one S. A. Hanson, was later listed among those associated with the <a href="Benson%20Syndicate">Benson Syndicate</a>, and he combined actual with probably fabricated surveys. Topographic surveys performed by Lieutenant <a href="Montgomery%20M.%20Macomb">Montgomery M. Macomb</a>, under George M Wheeler's <a href="Surveys%20West%20of%20the%20100th%20Meridian">Surveys West of the 100th Meridian</a>, were completed in the late 1870s and early 1880s.

James Savage's trading camp on the <a href="Merced%20River">Merced River</a>, west of Yosemite Valley, was raided by Native Americans in December 1850, after which the raiders retreated into the mountains. An appeal to the <a href="governor%20of%20California">governor of California</a> to put an end to this and other raids led to the formation of the <a href="Mariposa%20Battalion">Mariposa Battalion</a> in 1851, and the start of the <a href="Mariposa%20War">Mariposa War</a>.

Savage led the battalion into Yosemite Valley in 1851, in pursuit of around 200 Ahwaneechees led by Chief Tenaya. On March 27, 1851, the company of 50 to 60 men reached what is now called Old Inspiration Point, from where Yosemite Valley's main features are visible. Chief Tenaya and his band were eventually captured and their village burned, fulfilling the prophecy an old and dying <a href="medicine%20man">medicine man</a> had given Tenaya many years before. The Ahwahnechee were escorted by their captor, Captain John Bowling, to the <a href="Fresno%20River%20Reservation">Fresno River Reservation</a>, and the battalion was disbanded on July 1, 1851. Life on the reservation was unpleasant and the Ahwahneechee longed for their valley. Reservation officials consented and allowed Tenaya and some of his band to return on their own recognizance.
A group of eight miners entered Yosemite Valley in May 1852, and were allegedly attacked by Tenaya's warriors; two of the miners were killed. Regular army troops under the direction of Lt. Tredwell Moore retaliated by shooting six Ahwahneechee who were in possession of white men's clothing.

Tenaya's band fled the valley and sought refuge with the Mono, his mother's tribe. In mid-1853, the Ahwahneechee returned to the valley, but they subsequently betrayed the hospitality of their former Mono hosts by stealing horses that the Mono had taken from non-indigenous ranchers. In return, the Monos tracked down and killed many of the remaining Ahwahneechee, including Tenaya; <a href="Tenaya%20Lake">Tenaya Lake</a> is named after the fallen chief. Hostilities subsided and by the mid-1850s local European American residents started to befriend Native Americans still living in the Yosemite area.

Members of the battalion proposed names for the valley while they were camped at Bridalveil Meadow. The company physician who had been attached to Savage's unit, Dr. <a href="Lafayette%20Bunnell">Lafayette Bunnell</a>, suggested "Yo-sem-i-ty", after what the surrounding Sierra Miwok tribes, who feared the Yosemite Valley tribe, called them. Savage, who spoke some native dialects, translated this as "full-grown grizzly bear." The term, which was possibly derived from or confused with the similar "uzumati" or "uhumati", meaning "grizzly bear," is the Southern Sierra Miwok word "Yohhe'meti", meaning "they are killers." Bunnell named many other local topographic features on the same trip.

Bunnell drafted an article about the trip, but destroyed it when a newspaper correspondent in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> suggested cutting his 1,500- foot (460 m) height estimate for the valley's walls in half; the walls are in fact twice the height that Bunnell surmised. The first published account of Yosemite Valley was written by Lt. Tredwell Moore for the January 20, 1854, issue of the "Mariposa Chronicle", establishing the modern spelling of "Yosemite". Bunnell described his awestruck impressions of the valley in his book, "The Discovery of the Yosemite", published in 1892.
Forty-eight Non-Indian people visited Yosemite Valley in 1855, including San Francisco writer <a href="James%20Mason%20Hutchings">James Mason Hutchings</a> and artist <a href="Thomas%20Ayres%20%28artist%29">Thomas Ayres</a>. Hutchings wrote an article about his experience that was published in the July 12, 1855, issue of the "Mariposa Gazette" and Ayres' sketch of <a href="Yosemite%20Falls">Yosemite Falls</a> was published in late 1855; four of his drawings were presented in the lead article of the July 1856 and initial issue of "Hutchings' Illustrated California Magazine". The article and illustrations created tourist interest in Yosemite and eventually led to its protection.

Ayres returned in 1856 and visited <a href="Tuolumne%20Meadows">Tuolumne Meadows</a> in the area's high country. His highly detailed angularly exaggerated artwork and his written accounts were distributed nationally and an art exhibition of his drawings was held in New York City.

Hutchings took photographer <a href="Charles%20Leander%20Weed">Charles Leander Weed</a> to Yosemite Valley in 1859; Weed took the first photographs of the valley's features, which were presented to the public in a September exhibition held in San Francisco. Hutchings published four installments of "The Great Yo-semite Valley" from October 1859 to March 1860 in his magazine and re-published a collection of these articles in his "Scenes of Wonder and Curiosity in California", which remained in print into the 1870s.
<a href="Carleton%20Watkins">Carleton Watkins</a> exhibited his Yosemite views at the <a href="1867%20Paris%20International%20Exposition">1867 Paris International Exposition</a>.

Photographer <a href="Ansel%20Adams">Ansel Adams</a> made his first trip to Yosemite in 1916; his photographs of the valley made him famous in the 1920s and 1930s. Adams willed the originals of his Yosemite photos to the Yosemite Park Association, and visitors can still buy direct prints from his original negatives. The studio in which the prints are sold was established in 1902 by artist <a href="Harry%20Cassie%20Best">Harry Cassie Best</a>.

Milton and Houston Mann opened a toll road to Yosemite Valley in 1856, up the South Fork of the Merced River. They charged the then considerable sum of two <a href="United%20States%20dollar">dollars</a> per person until the road was bought by <a href="Mariposa%20County%2C%20California">Mariposa County</a>, after which it became free.

In 1856, settler <a href="Galen%20Clark">Galen Clark</a> discovered the <a href="Mariposa%20Grove">Mariposa Grove</a> of giant sequoia at <a href="Wawona%2C%20California">Wawona</a>, an indigenous encampment in what is now the southwestern part of the park. Clark completed a bridge over the South Fork of the Merced River in 1857 at Wawona for traffic headed toward Yosemite Valley and provided a way station for travelers on the road the Mann brothers built to the valley.

Simple lodgings, later called the Lower Hotel, were completed soon afterward; the Upper Hotel, later renamed Hutchings House and eventually known as <a href="Cedar%20Cottage">Cedar Cottage</a>, was opened in 1859. In 1876, the more substantial <a href="Wawona%20Hotel">Wawona Hotel</a> was built to serve tourists visiting the nearby grove of big trees and those on their way to Yosemite Valley. Aaron Harris opened the first campground business in Yosemite in 1876.

Visitation and interest in Yosemite continued to grow through the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarian</a> minister <a href="Thomas%20Starr%20King">Thomas Starr King</a> visited the valley in 1860 and saw some of the negative effects that settlement and commercial activity were having on the area. Six travel letters by Starr King were published in the "<a href="Boston%20Evening%20Transcript">Boston Evening Transcript</a>" in 1860 and 1861; Starr King became the first person with a nationally recognized voice to call for a public park at Yosemite. <a href="Oliver%20Wendell%20Holmes%2C%20Sr.">Oliver Wendell Holmes</a> and <a href="John%20Greenleaf%20Whittier">John Greenleaf Whittier</a> read and commented on Starr King's letters and landscape architect <a href="Frederick%20Law%20Olmsted">Frederick Law Olmsted</a> was prompted by the warnings to visit the Yosemite area in 1863.

Pressure from Starr King and Olmsted, photographs by <a href="Carleton%20Watkins">Carleton Watkins</a>, and geological data from the 1863 <a href="Geological%20Survey%20of%20California">Geological Survey of California</a> prompted legislators to take action. Senator <a href="John%20Conness">John Conness</a> of California introduced a park bill in 1864 to the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a> to cede Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of Big Trees to California.

The bill easily passed both houses of the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a>, and was signed by President <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> on June 30, 1864. The Yosemite Grant, as it was called, was given to California as a state park for "public use, resort and recreation". A board of commissioners, with Frederick Law Olmsted as chairman, was formed in September 1864 to govern the grant, but it did not meet until 1866.

The commission appointed Galen Clark as the grant's first guardian, but neither Clark nor the commissioners had the authority to evict <a href="Homestead%20Act">homesteaders</a>. <a href="Josiah%20Whitney">Josiah Whitney</a>, the first director of the California Geological Survey, lamented that Yosemite Valley would meet the same fate as <a href="Niagara%20Falls">Niagara Falls</a>, which at that time was a <a href="tourist%20trap">tourist trap</a> with tolls on every bridge, path, trail, and viewpoint.
Hutchings and a small group of settlers sought legal homesteading rights on of the valley floor. The issue was not settled until 1874 when the land holdings of Hutchings and three others were invalidated and the state legislature appropriated $60,000 ($ as of 2019) to compensate the settlers, of which Hutchings received $20,000.

Conditions in Yosemite Valley and access to the park steadily improved. In 1878, Clark used dynamite to breach a recessional <a href="moraine">moraine</a> in the valley to drain a swamp behind it. Tourism significantly increased after a <a href="Sacramento%2C%20California">Sacramento</a> to <a href="Stockton%2C%20California">Stockton</a> extension of the <a href="First%20Transcontinental%20Railroad">First Transcontinental Railroad</a> was completed in 1869 and the <a href="Central%20Pacific%20Railroad">Central Pacific Railroad</a> reached <a href="Merced%2C%20California">Merced</a> in 1872.

The long horseback ride from Merced remained a deterrent to tourists. Three <a href="stagecoach">stagecoach</a> roads were built in the mid-1870s to provide better access; Coulterville Road (June 1874), Big Oak Flat Road (July 1874), and the Wawona Road (July 1875). A road to <a href="Glacier%20Point">Glacier Point</a> was completed in 1882 by John Conway, and the Great Sierra Wagon Road was opened in 1883, which roughly followed the Mono Trail to Tuolumne Meadows.

Clark and the sitting commissioners were removed from office by the California Legislature in 1880, and Hutchings became the new guardian. Hutchings in turn was replaced as guardian, in 1884, by <a href="W.%20E.%20Dennison">W. E. Dennison</a>. Clark was reappointed as guardian in 1889 and retired in 1896.

In 1900, Oliver Lippincott became the first to drive an automobile into Yosemite Valley. <a href="Yosemite%20Valley%20Railroad">Yosemite Valley Railroad</a>, nicknamed "the short line to paradise," arrived at nearby <a href="El%20Portal%2C%20California">El Portal, California</a> in 1907. Numerous hiking and horse trails were cleared, including a walking path through Mariposa Grove.

Yosemite's first concession was established in 1884 when Mr. and Mrs. John Degnan established a bakery and store. The Desmond Park Service Company was granted a twenty-year concession in 1916; the company bought out or built hotels, stores, camps, a dairy, a garage, and other park services. Desmond changed its name to the Yosemite National Park Company in December 1917 and was reorganized in 1920.

The Curry Company was started by David and Jenny Curry in 1899; the couple also founded Camp Curry, now known as <a href="Curry%20Village">Curry Village</a>. The Currys lobbied reluctant park supervisors to allow expansion of concessionaire operations and development in the area.

Administrators in the National Park Service felt that limiting the number of concessionaires in each national park would be more financially sound. The Curry Company and its rival, the Yosemite National Park Company, were forced to merge in 1925 to form the <a href="Yosemite%20Park%20%26amp%3B%20Curry%20Company">Yosemite Park & Curry Company</a> (YP&CC).

Immediately following his arrival in California in March 1868, naturalist <a href="John%20Muir">John Muir</a> set out for the Yosemite area, where he found work tending to the sheep owned by a local rancher, Pat Delaney. Muir's employment provided him with the opportunity to study the area's plants, rocks, and animals; the articles and scientific papers he wrote describing his observations helped to popularize the area and to increase scientific interest in it. Muir was one of the first to suggest that Yosemite Valley's major landforms were created by large alpine glaciers, contradicting the view of established scientists such as Josiah Whitney, who regarded Muir as an amateur.
Alarmed by over grazing of meadows, logging of giant sequoia, and other damage, Muir changed from being a promoter and scientist to an advocate for further protection. He persuaded many influential people to camp with him in the area, such as <a href="Ralph%20Waldo%20Emerson">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a> in 1871. Muir tried to convince his guests that the entire area should be under federal protection. None of his guests through the 1880s could do much for Muir's cause, except for <a href="Robert%20Underwood%20Johnson">Robert Underwood Johnson</a>, editor of "<a href="Century%20Magazine">Century Magazine</a>". Through Johnson, Muir had a national audience for his writing and a highly motivated and crafty congressional lobbyist.

Muir's wish was partially granted on October 1, 1890, when the area outside the valley and sequoia grove became a <a href="National%20parks%20%28United%20States%29">national park</a> under the unopposed Yosemite Act. The Act provided "for the preservation from injury of all timber, mineral deposits, natural curiosities, or wonders within said reservation, and their retention in their natural condition" and prohibited "wanton destruction of the fish and game and their capture or destruction for the purposes of merchandise or profit."

Yosemite National Park included the entire upper drainages of two river <a href="drainage%20basin">watersheds</a>. Preservation of watersheds was very important to Muir, who said "you cannot save Yosemite Valley without saving its Sierran fountains." The State of California retained control of Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of Big Trees. Muir and 181 others founded the <a href="Sierra%20Club">Sierra Club</a> in 1892, in part to lobby for the transfer of the valley and the grove into the national park.

Like <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone National Park</a> before it, Yosemite National Park was at first administered by various units of the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a>. Captain <a href="Abram%20Wood">Abram Wood</a> led the <a href="U.S.%204th%20Cavalry%20Regiment">4th Cavalry Regiment</a> into the new park on May 19, 1891, and set up Camp A.E. Wood (now the Wawona Campground) in Wawona. Each summer, 150 cavalrymen traveled from the <a href="Presidio%20of%20San%20Francisco">Presidio of San Francisco</a> to patrol the park. Approximately 100,000 sheep were illegally led into Yosemite's high meadows each year. The Army lacked legal authority to arrest the herders, but instead escorted them several days' hike from their flock, which left the sheep vulnerable. By the late 1890s sheep grazing was no longer a problem, but at least one herder continued to graze his sheep in the park into the 1920s.

The Army also tried to control poaching. In 1896, acting Superintendent Colonel S. B. M. Young stopped issuing firearm permits after discovering that large numbers of game and fish were being killed. Poaching continues to be an issue in the 21st century. The Army's administration of the park ended in 1914.

Galen Clark retired as the state grant's guardian in 1896, leaving Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of Big Trees under ineffective stewardship. Pre-existing problems in the state grant worsened and new problems arose, but the cavalry could only monitor the situation. Muir and the Sierra Club continued to lobby the government and influential people for the creation of a unified Yosemite National Park. The Sierra Club began to organize annual trips to Yosemite in 1901 in an effort to make the remote area more accessible.

U.S. President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> camped with John Muir near <a href="Glacier%20Point">Glacier Point</a> for three days in May 1903. During that trip, Muir convinced Roosevelt to take control of the valley and the grove away from California and give it to the federal government. On June 11, 1906, Roosevelt signed a bill that did precisely that, and the superintendent's headquarters was moved from Wawona to Yosemite Valley.

To secure congressional and State of California approval for the plan, the size of the park was reduced by more than , which excluded natural wonders such as the <a href="Devils%20Postpile%20National%20Monument">Devils Postpile</a> and prime wildlife habitat. The park was again reduced in size in 1906, when logging began in an area around Wawona. Acting superintendent Major H. C. Benson said in 1908 that "game is on the decrease. Each reduction of the park has cut another portion of the winter resort of game." The various changes meant that the park was reduced to two-thirds of its original size.

About between the Tuolumne and the Merced big tree groves were added to the park in 1930 through land purchases by the federal government and matching funds provided by industrialist <a href="John%20D.%20Rockefeller">John D. Rockefeller</a>. Another near Wawona were added in 1932. The Carl Inn Tract, close to the Rockefeller purchase, was secured in 1937 and 1939.

San Francisco Mayor <a href="James%20D.%20Phelan">James D. Phelan</a> hired USGS engineer Joseph P. Lippincott in 1900 to perform a discreet survey of <a href="Hetch%20Hetchy%20Valley">Hetch Hetchy Valley</a>, located north of Yosemite Valley in the national park. His report stated that a dam of the <a href="Tuolumne%20River">Tuolumne River</a> in the Hetch Hetchy Valley was the best choice to create a drinking water reservoir for the city. Lippincott sought <a href="water%20right">water right</a>s to the Tuolumne River and rights to build reservoirs at Hetch Hetchy and <a href="Lake%20Eleanor">Lake Eleanor</a> on behalf of Phelan in 1901. These requests were rejected in 1903 by Secretary of the Interior <a href="Ethan%20A.%20Hitchcock%20%28Interior%29">Ethan Allen Hitchcock</a>, who felt the application was "not in keeping with the public interest."
The <a href="1906%20San%20Francisco%20earthquake">1906 San Francisco earthquake</a> tipped the balance in favor of granting the city the right to build the dam. Rights to Hetch Hetchy were granted to the City of San Francisco in 1908 by Secretary of the Interior <a href="James%20Rudolph%20Garfield">James Rudolph Garfield</a>, who wrote: "Domestic use is the highest use to which water and available storage basins ... can be put."

A nationally publicized fight over the dam project ensued; preservationists like Muir wanted to leave wild areas wild, and conservationists like <a href="Gifford%20Pinchot">Gifford Pinchot</a> wanted to manage wild areas for the betterment of mankind. Robert Underwood Johnson and the Sierra Club joined the fight to save the valley from flooding. Muir wrote, "Dam Hetch Hetchy! As well dam for watertanks the people's cathedrals and churches, for no holier temple has ever been consecrated by the heart of man." Pinchot, who was director of the <a href="U.S.%20Forest%20Service">U.S. Forest Service</a>, wrote to his close friend Roosevelt that "the highest possible use which could be made of it would be to supply pure water to a great center of population."

Roosevelt's successor, <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a>, signed the <a href="Raker%20Act">Raker Act</a> into law on December 13, 1913, which authorized construction of the dam. <a href="Hetch%20Hetchy%20Reservoir">Hetch Hetchy Reservoir</a> grew as the valley was flooded behind the <a href="O%27Shaughnessy%20Dam%20%28California%29">O'Shaughnessy Dam</a> in 1923. The Raker Act also gave the city the right to store water in Lake Eleanor and Cherry Lake, both located northwest of Hetch Hetchy in the park.

Shortly before Muir died he expressed the hope that "some compensating good must follow" from the Raker Act. The fight over the dam strengthened the conservation movement by popularizing it nationally. 

The administration of Yosemite National Park was transferred to the newly formed <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> in 1916, when <a href="W.%20B.%20Lewis">W. B. Lewis</a> was appointed as the park's superintendent. <a href="Parsons%20Memorial%20Lodge">Parsons Memorial Lodge</a> and <a href="Tioga%20Pass%20Road">Tioga Pass Road</a>, along with campgrounds at Tenaya and Merced lakes, were completed the same year; six hundred automobiles entered the east side of the park using Tioga Road that summer. The "All-Weather Highway" (now <a href="California%20State%20Route%20140">State Route 140</a>) opened in 1926, ensuring year-long visitation and delivery of supplies under normal conditions.

Completion of the -long <a href="Wawona%20Tunnel">Wawona Tunnel</a> in 1933 significantly reduced travel time to Yosemite Valley from Wawona. The famous Tunnel View is on the valley side of the tunnel and Old Inspiration Point is above it. A flood, reduced lumber and mining extraction, and greatly increased automobile and bus use forced the Yosemite Valley Railway out of business in 1945. The present day Tioga Road, now part of <a href="California%20State%20Route%20120">California State Route 120</a>, was dedicated in 1961.
Interpretive programs and services for national parks were pioneered in Yosemite by Harold C. Bryant and <a href="Loye%20Holmes%20Miller">Loye Holmes Miller</a> in 1920. Ansel F. Hall became the first park naturalist in 1921 and served in that role for two years. Hall's idea to have park museums act as public contact centers for interpretive programs became a model followed by other national parks in the United States and internationally. <a href="Yosemite%20Museum">Yosemite Museum</a>, the first permanent museum in the National Park System, was completed in 1926.

The <a href="Ahwahnee%20Hotel">Ahwahnee Hotel</a>, in Yosemite Valley, is a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a>. Built in 1927, it is a luxury hotel designed by the architect <a href="Gilbert%20Stanley%20Underwood">Gilbert Stanley Underwood</a>, decorated in Native American motifs. For many years it hosted an annual pageant produced by Ansel Adams. During World War II it was used as a rehabilitation hospital for soldiers.

Large floods covered Yosemite Valley in 1937, 1950, 1955, and 1997. These floods had a flow rate of 22,000 to 25,000 cubic feet (620 to 700 m) per second, as measured at the Pohono Bridge gauging station in Yosemite Valley.

All the structures in Old Yosemite Village, except for the chapel, were either moved to the Pioneer Yosemite History center in Wawona or demolished during the 1950s and 1960s. Other structures in the park were also moved to the history center. Cedar Cottage, the oldest building in Yosemite Valley, was demolished in 1941 along with others, even though they had not been flooded. Little regard was given to historic preservation, as the priority was thought to be the preservation and restoration of natural scenery.

Congress set aside about 89 percent of the park in a highly protected <a href="wilderness%20area">wilderness area</a> through passage of the <a href="Wilderness%20Act">Wilderness Act</a> of 1964. No roads, motorized vehicles (except rescue helicopters and other emergency vehicles), or any development beyond trail maintenance are allowed in this area. The adjacent <a href="Ansel%20Adams%20Wilderness">Ansel Adams Wilderness</a> and <a href="John%20Muir%20Wilderness">John Muir Wilderness</a> were also protected under the act and include regions removed from the park immediately before it was unified with the state grant in 1906.

The "<a href="Yosemite%20Firefall">Yosemite Firefall</a>", in which the embers from a bonfire were pushed off a cliff near Glacier Point to create a spectacular effect, was ended in 1968 because it was deemed to be inconsistent with park values. The firefall was occasionally performed in the 1870s and became a nightly tradition with the founding of Camp Curry.

Broader tensions in American society surfaced in Yosemite when a large number of youths gathered in the park over the summer of 1970, triggering a riot on July 4 after rangers tried to evict visitors from camping illegally in Stoneman Meadow. Rioters attacked the rangers with rocks, and pulled mounted rangers from their horses. The <a href="United%20States%20National%20Guard">National Guard</a> was brought in to restore order.

The Yosemite Park and Curry Company was bought by <a href="Music%20Corporation%20of%20America">Music Corporation of America</a> (MCA) in 1973. In 1988, concessionaires brought in $500 million ($ as of 2019), and paid the federal government $12.5 million ($ as of 2019) for the franchise. <a href="Delaware%20North%20Companies">Delaware North Companies</a> became the primary concessionaire for Yosemite in 1992. The agreement it signed with the National Park Service increased yearly park revenue from concessionaires to $20 million ($ as of 2019).

In 1999, four women were killed by <a href="Cary%20Stayner">Cary Stayner</a> just outside the park. That same year a large rockslide originating at the east side of Glacier Point ended near the <a href="Happy%20Isles">Happy Isles</a> of the Merced River, creating a debris field larger than several football fields. Tourism dropped a little after those incidents, but soon returned to its previous level.

Plans for reducing human impact on the park were released by the Park Service in 1980. The General Management Plan specified a reduction of 17 percent in overnight accommodations, a 68 percent reduction in staff housing and removal of golf courses and tennis courts by 1990, yet there were still 1,300 buildings in Yosemite Valley and of the valley floor were covered by parking lots in the late 1990s. The goals were not met, but flooding in January 1997 destroyed park infrastructure in Yosemite Valley. The Yosemite Valley Plan was later established to implement the General Management Plan and over 250 other actions.

The Awahnechee and other aboriginal groups changed the environment of the Yosemite area. Parts of valley floors were intentionally burned each year to encourage the growth of acorn-bearing <a href="Quercus%20kelloggii">black oaks</a>. Fire kept forests open, reducing the risk of ambush, and the open areas helped to expand and maintain meadows.

Early park guardians drained swamps, which reduced the number and extent of meadows. In the 1860s there were over of meadows in the valley compared to by the end of the 20th century. The remaining meadows are maintained by manually clearing trees and shrubs. The Park Service has prohibited driving and camping in meadows, a common practice in the 1910s to 1930s and cattle and horses are no longer allowed to roam freely in the park.

<a href="Fire%20suppression">Fire suppression</a> encouraged the growth of young coniferous trees, such as <a href="ponderosa%20pine">ponderosa pine</a> and <a href="incense%20cedar">incense cedar</a>; adult conifers create enough shade to inhibit the growth of young black oak trees. By the 20th century, fire suppression and the lowering of water tables by draining swamps led to the establishment of dense conifer forests where mixed and open conifer-oak woodlands had previously grown. Fire suppression policies have been replaced by a fire management program which includes the annual use of <a href="prescribed%20fire">prescribed fire</a>s. Fire is especially important to the <a href="giant%20sequoia">giant sequoia</a> groves, whose seeds cannot germinate without fire-touched soil.

Logging used to be carried out in the area. Over one-half-billion <a href="board%20feet">board feet</a> of timber were felled between World War I and 1930, when <a href="John%20D.%20Rockefeller%2C%20Jr.">John D. Rockefeller, Jr.</a> and the federal government bought out the <a href="Yosemite%20Lumber%20Company">Yosemite Lumber Company</a>.

Muir and the Sierra Club initially encouraged efforts to increase visitation to the park. Muir wrote that even the "frivolous and inappreciative" visitors were on the whole "a most hopeful sign of the times, indicating at least the beginning of our return to nature – for going to the mountains is going home."

The first automobile entered Yosemite Valley in 1900, but growth in car traffic did not increase significantly until 1913, when they were first officially allowed to enter; the next year, 127 cars entered the park.

Park visitation increased from 15,154 in 1914, to 35,527 in 1918, and to 461,000 in 1929. Two-thirds of a million visited in 1946, 1 million in 1954, 2 million by 1966, 3 million in the 1980s, and 4 million in the 1990s.

<a href="Half%20Dome">Half Dome</a> is a prominent and iconic granite dome that rises above the floor of Yosemite Valley. It was first climbed on October 12, 1875, by the Scottish blacksmith of Yosemite Valley, George C. Anderson. A rope that Anderson laid was used by six men, including 61-year-old Galen Clark, and one woman, to scale the last of Half Dome. Anderson's rope was repaired several times and was replaced in 1919 by a stairway built by the Sierra Club.

Sunnyside walk-in campground, better known as <a href="Camp%204%20%28Yosemite%29">Camp 4</a>, was built in 1929. <a href="Rock%20climbing">Rock climbers</a>, who started to scale the cliffs of Yosemite in the 1950s, camped there. In 1997, a flood in Yosemite Valley destroyed employee housing in the valley. The Park Service wanted to build dormitories next to Camp 4, but <a href="Tom%20Frost">Tom Frost</a>, the <a href="American%20Alpine%20Club">American Alpine Club</a> and others succeeded in killing the plan. Camp 4 was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> on February 21, 2003, because of its role in the development of rock climbing as a sport.

<a href="Badger%20Pass%20Ski%20Area">Badger Pass Ski Area</a> was established in 1935. The 9-hole Wawona Golf Course opened in June 1918 in a meadow adjacent to the Wawona Hotel. A golf course was later built near the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite Valley, but was removed and converted into a meadow in 1981.

Introduced animals and diseases had impacted the park area by the late 19th century. Galen Clark noted in the mid-1890s that native grasses and flowering plants in Yosemite Valley had been reduced in number by three-quarters.

<a href="White%20pine%20blister%20rust">White pine blister rust</a>, a fungal disease that infects conifer trees, was accidentally introduced in <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a> in 1910 and had reached California by the 1920s. It has since infected many sugar pine trees in the Yosemite area. The rust is managed by removing plants belonging to the <a href="ribes">ribes</a> genus, which act as carriers of the fungus.

<a href="Trout">Trout</a> were introduced in Yosemite streams and lakes to promote fishing. Tadpole predation by the introduced fish reduced frog populations. Lakes and streams are no longer stocked in the park.

Current park managers focus on controlling nine high-priority <a href="Invasive%20species">invasive plant species</a> of <a href="noxious%20weeds">noxious weeds</a>: <a href="Centaurea%20solstitialis">yellow star-thistle</a> ("Centaurea solstitialis"); <a href="Centaurea%20maculosa">spotted knapweed</a> ("Centaurea maculosa"); <a href="Rubus%20armeniacus">Himalayan blackberry</a> ("Rubus armeniacus"); <a href="Cirsium%20vulgare">bull thistle</a> ("Cirsium vulgare"); <a href="Holcus%20lanatus">velvet grass</a> ("Holcus lanatus"); <a href="Bromus%20tectorum">cheat grass</a> ("Bromus tectorum"); <a href="Genista%20monspessulana">French broom</a> ("Genista monspessulana"); <a href="Carduus%20pycnocephalus">Italian thistle</a> ("Carduus pycnocephalus"); and <a href="Lepidium%20latifolium">perennial pepperweed</a> ("Lepidium latifolium"). In 2008, the park began to use the herbicides <a href="glyphosate">glyphosate</a> and <a href="aminopyralid">aminopyralid</a> to augment manual methods to manage the most threatening plants.

<a href="Brown%20bear">Brown bear</a>s, also called grizzlies, featured prominently in <a href="Miwok%20mythology">Miwok mythology</a> and were the top predators in the region until the 1920s, when they became locally extinct. A sketch of a Yosemite grizzly by <a href="Charles%20Nahl">Charles Nahl</a> adorns the <a href="flag%20of%20California">flag of California</a>.

<a href="American%20black%20bear">American black bear</a>s were a common attraction by the 1930s, but in 1929 alone 81 people required treatment for bear-related injuries. Troublesome bears were marked with white paint before being relocated to other parts of the park, and repeat offenders were killed. Bear feeding shows were stopped in 1940, but the Park Service continued to kill bears that habitually raided camps; 200 were put down between 1960 and 1972. Park visitors are now educated about proper food storage.

To supplement their incomes, the rangers trapped predators such as <a href="coyote">coyote</a>, <a href="fox">fox</a>, <a href="lynx">lynx</a>, <a href="mountain%20lion">mountain lion</a>, and <a href="wolverine">wolverine</a> for their furs, a practice that survived until 1925. Predator control continued however; 43 mountain lions were killed in Yosemite by the state lion hunter in 1927. <a href="Cooper%27s%20hawk">Cooper's hawk</a> and <a href="sharp-shinned%20hawk">sharp-shinned hawk</a> were hunted to local extinction.

<a href="Bighorn%20sheep">Bighorn sheep</a>, which were driven locally extinct through hunting and disease, have been reintroduced in the east of the park.

Vampire: The Masquerade – Redemption

Vampire: The Masquerade – Redemption is a 2000 <a href="role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing video game</a> developed by <a href="Nihilistic%20Software">Nihilistic Software</a> and published by <a href="Activision">Activision</a>. Set in <a href="White%20Wolf%20Publishing">White Wolf Publishing</a>'s <a href="World%20of%20Darkness">World of Darkness</a>, the game is based on White Wolf's role-playing game "" and follows the adventures of Christof Romuald, a 12th-century French crusader who is killed and subsequently revived as a Vampire. The game depicts Christof's centuries-long journey from the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Dark Ages</a> of 12th century Prague and Vienna to modern-day London and New York City in search of his humanity and his kidnapped love, the nun Anezka.

"Redemption" is presented in the <a href="first-person%20%28video%20games%29">first-</a> and <a href="third-person%20%28video%20games%29">third-person</a> perspectives. The player controls Christof and up to three allies through a <a href="Nonlinear%20gameplay">linear structure</a>, providing the player with missions to progress through a set narrative. Certain actions committed by Christof throughout the game can raise or lower his humanity, affecting which of the game's three endings the player receives. As a Vampire, Christof is imbued with a variety of abilities and powers that can be used to combat or avoid enemies and obstacles. Use of these abilities drains Christof's supply of blood which can be replenished by drinking from enemies or innocents. It includes multiplayer gameplay called "Storyteller", which allows one player to create a narrative for a group of players with the ability to modify the game dynamically in reaction to the players' actions.

Founded in March 1998, Nihilistic's twelve-man team began development of "Redemption" the following month as their first game. It took the team twenty-four months to complete on a budget of . The team relied on eight outside contractors to provide elements that the team could not supply, such as music and artwork. The game's development was difficult: late changes to software forced the developers to abandon completed code and assets; a focus on high-quality graphics and sound meant that the game ran poorly on some computer systems; and the original scope of the game exceeded the game's schedule and budget, forcing the team to cancel planned features.

"Redemption" was released for Microsoft Windows on June 7, 2000, with a Mac OS version following in November 2001. The game received a mixed critical response; reviewers praised its graphics and its multiplayer functionality, but were polarized by the quality of the story and combat. It received the 1999 <a href="Game%20Critics%20Awards">Game Critics Awards</a> for Best Role-Playing game. It was successful enough to merit the production of a sequel, "", which was released in November 2004 as an indirect sequel set in the same fictional universe.

"Vampire: The Masquerade – Redemption"—shortened to "Redemption"—is a <a href="role-playing%20game">role-playing game</a> (RPG) presented primarily from the <a href="Third-person%20shooter">third-person</a> perspective; the playable character is shown on the screen while an optional first-person mode used to view the character's immediate environment is available. The camera can be freely rotated around the character and positioned above it to give a greater overview of the immediate area. The game follows a linear, mission-based structure. Interaction is achieved by using a <a href="Mouse%20%28computing%29">mouse</a> to click on an enemy or environmental object to attack it or to activate it. Interaction is context based; clicking on an enemy initiates combat, while clicking on a door causes it to open or close.

The playable character can lead a group of three additional allies into battle, controlling their actions to attack a single enemy or to use specific powers. Characters can be set to one of three modes: defensive, neutral, or offensive. In defensive mode, the character remains distant from battles, while offensive mode sends the character directly into battle. The main character and active allies are represented by portraits on screen that reflect their current physical or emotional state, showing sadness, anger, feeding, or the presence of injuries or staking—having been stabbed through the heart and rendered immobile.

The player can access various long-range and <a href="melee%20weapon">melee weapon</a>s including swords, shields, bows, and guns, stakes, and holy water. Some weapons have a secondary, more powerful attack; for example a sword can be spun to decapitate a foe. Because they are vampires, allies and enemies are susceptible to damage from sunlight. Disciplines (vampiric powers) are used to supplement physical attacks. Each discipline can be upgraded, becoming a more powerful version of itself; alternatively, other in-game benefits can be gained. The game features disciplines that allow the player to enhance the character's physical abilities such as speed, strength, or durability. Disciplines can also allow the player to <a href="Hypnosis">mesmerize</a> an enemy or a potential feeding victim, render the character invisible to escape detection, turn the character into mist, summon serpents to attack enemies, heal, revive their allies, and teleport to a haven. Each discipline can be upgraded up to five times, affecting the abilities' durations, the scale of the damage or their effect, and the cost of using it. The characters' health and disciplines are reliant on blood, which can only be replenished by feeding on the living—including other party members—or finding blood containers such as bottles and plasma bags. Drinking an innocent to death and other negative actions reduces the player's humanity, increasing the likelihood of entering a frenzy when injured or low on blood, during which they indiscriminately attack friend and foe.

Completing objectives and defeating enemies is rewarded with <a href="experience%20points">experience points</a>, which are used to unlock or upgrade existing disciplines and improve each characters' statistics, such as strength or agility. Weapons, armor, and other accessories can be purchased or upgraded using money or valuable items, which are collected throughout the game. The character's inventory is grid-based; objects occupy an allotted amount of space, requiring the management of the storage space available. A belt allows some items to be selected for immediate use during gameplay, such as healing items, without the need to access them in the main inventory. The first version of the game allows progress to be saved only in the main character's haven or safehouse; it automatically saves other data at specific points. An update to the game enabled players to save their in-game data at any point in the in-game narrative.

"Redemption" features an online multiplayer component which allows players to engage in scenarios together. One player assumes the role of the Storyteller, guiding other players through a scenario using the Storyteller interface. The interface allows the Storyteller to create or modify scenarios by placing items, monsters, and characters across the map. Character statistics, such as experience points, abilities, and disciplines, can also be modified. Finally, the Storyteller can assume the role of any character at any given time. These functions allow the Storyteller to dynamically manipulate the play environment while the other players traverse it.

The events depicted in "Vampire: The Masquerade – Redemption" occur in two time periods: 12th century Prague and Vienna, and late-20th century London and New York City. The game is set in the <a href="World%20of%20Darkness">World of Darkness</a>; it depicts a world in which vampires, werewolves, demons, and other creatures influence human history. The vampires are divided into seven Clans of the <a href="Camarilla%20%28World%20of%20Darkness%29">Camarilla</a>—the vampire government—each with distinctive traits and abilities. The Toreadors are the closest to humanity—they have a passion for culture; the Ventrue are noble, powerful leaders; the Brujah are idealists who excel at fighting; the Malkavians are either cursed with insanity or blessed with insight; the Gangrel are loners in synchronization with their animalistic nature; the Tremere are secretive, untrustworthy, and wield blood magic; and the monstrous Nosferatu are condemned to remain hidden in the shadows. "Redemption" also features the Cappadocian clan; the Society of Leopold—modern-day vampire hunters; the Assamite clan of assassin vampires; the Setite clan; the Tzimisce clan, the Giovanni clan, and the Sabbat—vampires who revel in their nature, embracing the beast within.

The main character of "Redemption" is French crusader Christof Romuald, a once-proud, religious church knight who is transformed into a Brujah vampire. With his religious faith destroyed, Christof is forced to reassess his understanding of good and evil as he acclimates to his new life. Christof's anchor to humanity is the nun Anezka, a human with a pure soul who loves Chrisof even after his transformation. As a member of the Brujah under Ecaterina the Wise, Christof allies with Wilhem Streicher, the Gangrel Erik, and the Cappadocian Serena during his journeys through 12th century Prague. Other characters in this era include the slaver Count Orsi, the Tremere Etrius, and the Ventrue Prince Brandl.

Christof continues his quest into the late-20th century, where he allies with the Brujah Pink, the enslaved Toreador Lily, and the Nosferatu Samuel. Other characters include the 300-year-old human leader of the Society of Leopold, Leo Allatius—who has unnaturally extended his lifespan by consuming vampire blood— and the Setite leader Lucretia. During his journey, Christof comes into conflict with Vukodlak, a powerful Tzimisce vampire intent on usurping the clans' ancestors and taking their power for himself. Trapped in a mystical sleep by those who oppose his plot, Vukodlak commands his followers to help resurrect him.

In 1141 in Prague, crusader Christof Romuald is wounded in battle. He recovers in a church, where he is cared for by a nun called Anezka. The pair instantly fall in love but are restrained by their commitments to God. Christof enters a nearby silver mine to kill a monstrous Tzimisce vampire who is tormenting the city. Christof's victory is noted by the local vampires, one of whom, Ecaterina the Wise, turns him into a vampire to prevent another clan from taking him.

Initially defiant, Christof agrees to accompany Ecaterina's servant Wilhem on a mission to master his new vampiric abilities. Afterwards, he meets with Anezka and refuses to taint her with his cursed state. At Ecaterina's haven, the Brujah tell Christof about an impending war between the Tremere and Tzimisce clans that will devastate humans caught up in it. Wilhem and Christof gain the favor of the local Jews and Cappadocians, who devote their member Serena to the Brujah cause. The Ventrue prince Brandl tells the group that in Vienna, the Tremere are abducting humans to turn them into ghouls—servitors addicted and empowered by Vampire blood. The group infiltrate the Tremere chantry in Prague, and stop the Gangrel Erik from being turned into a Gargoyle, and he joins them. Christof learns that Anezka, seeking Christof's redemption, has visited the Tremere and Tzimisce clans, and the Vienna Tremere stronghold, Haus de Hexe. There, the Tremere leader Etrius turns Erik into a Gargoyle, forcing Christof to kill him. Etrius reveals that the Tzimisce abducted Anezka.

Returning to Prague, Christof finds the Tzimisce in nearby <a href="Vy%C5%A1ehrad">Vyšehrad</a> Castle have been revealed to the humans, who have launched an assault on the structure. Christof, Wilhem, and Serena infiltrate the castle and find that the powerful, slumbering Vukodlak has enslaved Anezka as a ghoul. Anezka rejects Christof and prepares to revive Vukodlak, but the outside assault collapses the castle upon them.

In 1999, the Society of Leopold excavates the site of Vyšehrad Castle; they recover Christof's body and take it to London, where he is awoken by a female voice. He learns that the events at Vyšehrad and the resulting human uprising divided the vampires into two sects: the Camarilla who seek to hide from humanity and the Sabbat who seek to regain dominion over it. The Society's excavation also enables Vukodlak's followers to recover Vyšehrad. After escaping, Christof meets Pink, who agrees to help him. They learn that the Setite clan has been shipping Vyšehrad contraband to New York City and infiltrate a Setite brothel to gain information. They kill the Setite leader Lucretia and recruit Lily, an enslaved prostitute.

Christof, Pink, and Lily travel to New York City aboard a contraband ship, rescue the Nosferatu Samuel from the Sabbat, and infiltrate a warehouse storing the Vyšehrad contraband. There they encounter Wilhem, who is now a Sabbat under Ecaterina following the collapse of their group. Wilhem reveals that Pink is an assassin working for Vukodlak. Pink escapes and Wilhem rejoins Christof, hoping to reclaim the humanity he has sacrificed during the previous 800 years. Together, Christof, Wilhem, Lily, and Samuel discover that Vukodlak is hidden beneath a church within his Cathedral of Flesh and that Anezka is still in his servitude. In the cathedral they find that Vukodlak has awoken; he tries to influence Christof by offering him Anezka then revealing that she is completely dependent on Vukodlak's blood and will die without him. Christof refuses and Vukodlak drops the group into tunnels beneath the cathedral. Christof finds the Wall of Memories, which hold Anezka's memories of the last millennia, showing she continued to hope as Vukodlak found new ways to defile and torment her. She eventually sacrificed her innocence to gain Vukodlak's trust, using her position to delay his resurrection over hundreds of years until, with no options left, she prayed for Christof's return. The group returns to the Cathedral and battles Vukodlak.

The ending of "Redemption" varies depending upon on the quantity of humanity Christof has retained during the game. If the quantity is great, Christof reconciles with Anezka and turns her into a vampire, sparing her from death. If his humanity is moderate, he surrenders to Vukodlak and becomes a ghoul; Vukodlak betrays Christof and forces him to murder Anezka. A lesser quantity of humanity results in Christof killing Vukodlak by drinking his blood. Greatly empowered, Christof forsakes his humanity, murders Anezka, and revels in his new power.

The development of "Vampire: The Masquerade – Redemption" began at <a href="Nihilistic%20Software">Nihilistic Software</a> in April 1998, shortly after the developer's founding in March that year. Its development was publicly announced in March 1999. Intending to move away from the first-person games the team members had worked on with previous companies, Nihilistic prepared a design and story for a futuristic RPG with similar themes and <a href="Gothic%20art">gothic</a> aesthetics to those of the "" series. After publisher <a href="Activision">Activision</a> approached the team using the White Wolf license, they adapted parts of their original design to fit the "Vampire" series, which became the original design for "Redemption". Endorsement by <a href="Id%20Software">Id Software</a> founder <a href="John%20Carmack">John Carmack</a> helped Nihilistic decide to work with Activision. The Nihilistic team developed "Redemption" over twenty-four months; the team expanded to twelve members by the end of development. The development team included Nihilistic President and CEO Ray Gesko, lead programmer Rob Huebner, world designer Steve Tietze, level designer Steve Thoms, lead artist Maarten Kraaijvanger, artist Yujin Kiem, art technician Anthony Chiang, and programmers Yves Borckmans and Ingar Shu.

Activision provided a budget of US$1.8 million; the amount was intentionally kept low to make the project manageable for Nihilistic and reduce the risk to Activision, which was relatively inexperienced with RPGs at the time. Nihilistic's management was committed to the entire team working in a one-room environment with no walls, doors, or offices, believing this would force the individual groups to communicate and allow each department to respond to queries immediately, saving hours or days of development time. "Redemption"s story was developed with input from Wolf; it was co-written by <a href="Daniel%20Greenberg%20%28game%20designer%29">Daniel Greenberg</a>, a writer for the source <a href="Tabletop%20role-playing%20game">pen-and-paper RPG</a>.

The small size of the team led to Nihilistic relying on eight external contractors to provide elements the team could not supply. Nick Peck was chosen to provide sounds effects, ambient loops, and additional voice recordings based on his previous work on "<a href="Grim%20Fandango">Grim Fandango</a>" (1998). Kevin Manthei provided the musical score for the game's 12th century sections, while a duo called Youth Engine provided the modern-day sections' score. Some artwork was outsourced; Peter Chan ("<a href="Day%20of%20the%20Tentacle">Day of the Tentacle</a>" (1993) and "Grim Fandango") developed concept art to establish the look of the game's environments, and Patrick Lambert developed character concepts and full-color drawings for the modelers and animators to use. Huebner considered the most important external relationship was with a small start-up company called Oholoko, which produced cinematic movies for the game's story elements and endings. Nihilistic met with various computer animation firms but their prices were too expensive for the project budget.

"Redemption" was officially <a href="Software%20release%20life%20cycle%23Release%20to%20manufacturing%20%28RTM%29">released to manufacturing</a> on May 30, 2000. The game features 300,000 lines of code, with a further 66,000 lines for JAVA scripts. In January 2000, it was announced that Nihilistic was seeking a studio to port "Redemption" to the <a href="Sega">Sega</a> <a href="Dreamcast">Dreamcast</a> video game console, however this version was never released. In February 2001, after the release of the PC version, it was announced that <a href="MacSoft">MacSoft</a> was developing a MacOS version of the game.

Nihilistic initially looked at existing game engines such as the <a href="Quake%20engine">Quake engine</a> and <a href="Unreal%20Engine">Unreal Engine</a>, but decided those engines, which were primarily designed for first-person shooters, would not be sufficient for its point-and-click driven RPG and decided to create its own engine for development of "Redemption". This was the NOD engine, which the developers could customize for the game's 3D perspective and role-playing mechanics. The team also considered that developing its own engine would allow it to freely reuse code for future projects or to license the engine for profit. NOD was prototyped using the <a href="Glide%20API">Glide</a> application programming interface (API) because the team believed it would be more stable during the engine's development, intending that once the engine was more complete, it would be moved to a more general API designed to support a wide range of hardware such as Direct3D. However, once a basic engine was in place in Glide, the programmers turned their attention to gameplay and functionality. By June 1999, "Redemption" was still running in Glide, which at that point lacked some of the basic features the team needed to demonstrate at that year's <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a>. When the team eventually switched to Direct3D, it was forced to abandon some custom code it had built to compensate for Glide's limitations such as texture and graphic management, which required the re-exporting of hundreds of levels and models for the new software. The late API switch also limited the time available to test the game's compatibility on a wide range of hardware. The team focused on building the game for <a href="Hardware%20acceleration">hardware accelerated</a> systems to avoid the limitations of supporting a wider range of systems, which had restricted the development of the company founders' previous game, "" (1997).

The programmers suggested using <a href="3D%20Studio%20Max">3D Studio Max</a> for art and level design, which would save money by allowing the company to license a single piece of software, but the lead artists successfully lobbied against this plan, believing that allowing the respective teams to choose the software would allow them to work most efficiently. Huebner said this saved the project more time than any other decision made during development. The level designers chose <a href="QERadiant">QERadiant</a> to take advantage of their previous experience using the software while working on Id Software's "<a href="Quake%20%28series%29">Quake</a>" series. Id allowed Nihilistic to license QERadiant and modify it to create a customized tool for its 3D environments. Because QERadiant was a finished, functional tool, it allowed the level designers to begin developing levels from the project's start and then export them into the NOD engine, rather than waiting for up to six months for Nihilistic to develop a custom tool or learning a new 3D level editor. In twenty-four months, the three level designers built over 100 in-game environments for "Redemption". They obtained blueprints and sketches of buildings from medieval Prague and Vienna to better represent that period and locations. The four-person art team led by Kraaijvanger used <a href="Alias%20Systems%20Corporation">Alias Wavefront</a> <a href="Autodesk%20Maya">Maya</a> to create 3D art. Nihilistic's management wanted Kraaijvanger to use a less expensive tool but relented when the cost was found to be lower than had been thought. Throughout the project, the art team built over 1,500 3D models.

At the start of development, Nihilistic wanted to support editing of the game by the user-community, having seen the benefits to the community while working on other games. Staff who worked on "Jedi Knight" knew the experience of creating a new, customized programming language called COG that gave the programmers the results they wanted but cost time and significant project resources. With "Redemption", they wanted to incorporate an existing scripting engine that would more easily enable users to further develop the game instead of developing their own code again, which would consume months of development time. The team tested various languages, but became aware of another studio, Rebel Boat Rocker, which was receiving attention for its use of the <a href="Java%20%28programming%20language%29">Java</a> language. Speaking to that studio's lead programmer Billy Zelsnak, Nihilistic decided to experiment with Java, having little prior knowledge of it. The language successfully integrated into the NOD engine without problems, providing a standardized and freely distributable scripting engine. Several designers were trained to use Java to allow them to build the several hundred scripts required to drive the game's storyline.

The Nihilistic team used their experience adapting an existing property for the "Star Wars" games to design "Redemption". Reasoning that most people would be familiar with vampire tropes, the team wrote the game assuming players would not need an explanation of the genre's common elements, while enabling them to explore White Wolf's additions to the mythos. When translating the pen-and-paper RPG to a video game, the team redesigned some of the disciplines to make them simpler to understand. For example, in the pen-and-paper game, the "Protean" discipline includes the abilities to see in the dark, grow claws, melt into the ground, and change into an animal, however in "Redemption" these were made into individual disciplines to make them instantly accessible, instead of requiring the player to select Protean and then select one of the sub-abilities.

Huebner said the team struggled with restraint. From inception, the team had developed its assets for a high-end system to ensure the finished project would have top-of-the-range graphics, and because if necessary, it could more easily scale down the art down than scale it up. However, the art teams were not stopped from producing new assets, resulting in "Redemption" requiring approximately 1GB of storage space to install. Additionally, textures were made in 32-bit color, models were extremely detailed—featuring between 1,000 and 2,000 triangles each on average—and levels were illuminated with high-resolution light-maps. Because the game was designed for high-end computer systems, it relied on algorithms to scale down the models; combined with the high detail art assets, "Redemption" was taxing to run on low- and mid-range systems. Nihilistic had intended to include both 16-bit and 32-bit versions of the game textures, and different sound quality levels to allow players to choose which versions to install, but the <a href="CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a> format was not spacious enough to accommodate more than one version of the game. The finished product barely fitted onto two CD-ROMs; some sound assets were removed to fit the format. This caused the game to use a large amount of computer resources and limited the ability to port it to more limited console environments.

The programmers identified early on that pathfinding—the ability of the variable-sized characters to navigate through the environment—would be a problem. Huebner cited the difficulty of programming characters to navigate an environment in which level designers are free to add stairs, ramps, and other 3D objects. They came up with a temporary solution and planned to improve the pathfinding later into development. By the time they properly addressed the problem, many of the levels were almost complete and featured few markers the programmers could use to control movement. They could identify walkable tiles but not walls, cliffs, and other environmental hazards. Ideal solutions, such as creating zones for characters could walk through would have taken too much time to retroactively add into the 100 created levels, so the programmers spent several weeks making small, iterative fixes to conceal the obvious errors in the pathfinding and leave less obvious ones intact.

From the outset, the team wanted to make a grand RPG, but were restricted by their budget and schedule. They were reluctant to cut any content such as one of the time periods or the multiplayer aspect, and they decided to postpone the original release date from March 2000 to June the same year. They also scaled back the scope of their multiplayer testing and canceled the planned release of an interactive pre-launch demo. The delay allowed Nihilistic to retain most of the intended design but they were forced to remove the ability to play the entire single-player campaign as a team online, compensating for this by adding two multiplayer scenarios built using levels from the single-player game. Huebner said they did not plan appropriately for multiplayer when building the Java scripts for the single-player game, meaning the scripts did not work effectively in multiplayer mode.

The multiplayer "Storyteller" mode was conceived early in the development cycle. Diverting from the typical death match or co-operative gameplay multiplayer modes, Storyteller required Nihilistic to develop an interface that could give one player, the Storyteller, enough control to run a particular scenario, and change events in the game in real time without making it too complex to understand for the average player. Much of the technology was simple to implement, requiring typical multiplayer software components that would allow users to connect with each other. The largest task required the development of an interface that could provide the Storyteller with control over the aspects of a multiplayer game without it becoming too complex. The interface had to contain lists of objects, characters, and other resources, and options to manipulate those resources. It had to be mostly accessible using a mouse as input, reserving the keyboard for less common and more advanced commands. The mode was inspired by the text-based <a href="MUD">Multi-User Dungeon</a>, a multiplayer real-time virtual world in which high-ranking users can manipulate the game's environment and dynamically create adventures.

"Vampire: The Masquerade – Redemption" was released for Microsoft Windows on June 7, 2000. The game's release included a standalone copy of the game, and a Collector's Edition containing a copy of the game, a hardbound, limited edition of White Wolf's "Book of Nod" chronicling the first Vampire, a Camarilla pendant, the game's strategy guide, and an alternative game case cover. The Collector's Edition also included a copy of the game's soundtrack, featuring songs by <a href="Type%20O%20Negative">Type O Negative</a>, <a href="Gravity%20Kills">Gravity Kills</a>, <a href="Ministry%20%28band%29">Ministry</a>, <a href="Darling%20Violetta">Darling Violetta</a>, <a href="Cubanate">Cubanate</a>, <a href="Primus%20%28band%29">Primus</a>, Youth Engine, and <a href="Kevin%20Manthei">Kevin Manthei</a>. Nihilistic also released Embrace, a level editor with access to the game's code to allow fans to modify levels and scripts. A Mac OS version was released in November 2001. 

During its first week on sale, the Microsoft Windows version of "Redemption" was the third best-selling game behind "<a href="The%20Sims%20%28video%20game%29">The Sims</a>" and "<a href="Who%20Wants%20to%20Be%20a%20Millionaire%3F%23Merchandise">Who Wants To Be A Millionaire 2nd Edition</a>". Sales of the Collector's Edition were individually tracked; it was the fifth best-selling game that same week. According to the sale tracking firm <a href="PC%20Data">PC Data</a>, "Redemption" had sold approximately 111,193 units across North America by October, earning $4.88 million. Approximately 57,000 units were sold in Germany by March 2001. It spent four months on its list of the 30 top-selling games, peaking at number 5 in July 2000, before leaving the charts in October. "Redemption" received a digital release on the <a href="GOG.com">GOG.com</a> service in February 2010. "Redemption" achieved enough success to merit the 2004 release of an indirect sequel, "", which was set in the same fictional universe and was developed by <a href="Troika%20Games">Troika Games</a>.
"Vampire: The Masquerade – Redemption" received a mixed critical response. The aggregating review websites <a href="GameRankings">GameRankings</a> and <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> give it a score of 75% (based on 33 reviews) and 74 out of 100 (based on 22 reviews), respectively. Reviewers compared it to other successful RPGs, including "<a href="Diablo%20II">Diablo II</a>", "<a href="Deus%20Ex%20%28video%20game%29">Deus Ex</a>", "", and the "<a href="Final%20Fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>" series.

The game's graphics received near-unanimous praise. <a href="Game%20Revolution">Game Revolution</a> said its "brilliant" graphics were among the best in gaming and "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>" said the graphics were the best in any PC RPG. "<a href="Computer%20Games%20Magazine">Computer Games</a>" said it was the most attractive PC game at the time, "<a href="ArsTechnica">ArsTechnica</a>" said it was the best game to look at and watch since "<a href="The%20Last%20Express">The Last Express</a>" (1997), and "<a href="PC%20Gamer%23PC%20Gamer%20US">PC Gamer</a>" said, "there has never been a more beautifully created RPG". The level design and environments were praised for the level of detail, providing a brooding, atmospheric aesthetic with "painstaking" detail. Reviewers also made positive comments about the game's lighting effects. Conversely, "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>" (CGW) said that while the game was attractive, the visuals were superficial and failed to emphasize the game's horror elements. They were also critical of the third-person in-game camera positioning, claiming that it obscured the area directly in front of the player and did not allow the player to look upwards.

Responses to the story were ambivalent; some reviewers called it strong with good dialog; others said it was poor. GameRevolution and CGW called the dialog poor, sophomoric, and often overly-verbose; in particular CGW said some speeches became an "agonizingly long filibuster" that only served to delay the return of control to the player. Other sources called it one of the richest, most engrossing stories to be found outside films and novels, and more original than most RPGs. "Computer Games" criticized the linear storyline, and said the few dialog choices available to the player had no real impact on the storytelling. CGW said the linear story prevented "Redemption" from being a true RPG because it lacked interaction with many characters, and the lack of player impact on the story made it seem as though they were not building characters but rather were getting them to the story milestones. According to "PC Gamer", while the game's linearity was a negative, it kept the narrative tight and compelling.

Reviewers variously appreciated and disliked the voice acting. Game Revolution and "Computer Games" said the acting ranged from adequate to good, while CGW said the voices were inappropriate and the 12th century European voices sounding like modern Americans, but that the modern-era featured better actors. "ArsTechnica" said the acting was inconsistent but was better than that of "Deus Ex". The weather effects, background sound, and moody music were said to blend together well and help immerse the player in the game's world. CGW said the sound quality was sometimes poor.

Much of Redemption's criticism focused on technical problems when it was released, undermining the game experience or making it unplayable. Several reviewers noted issues with the initial lack of a function to save game progress at any point, which meant that dying or technical issues with the game could necessitate them to reload a previous save, and then repeat up to 30 minutes of gameplay. CGW added that the repetitive gameplay meant that losing progress and having to repeat it was a particular downside. "Next Generation", who provided the game with a score of 3 out of 5, said that "Redemption" was potentially only a few patches away from being a 5 out of 5 game, if not for technical issues. "PC Gamer"s review even included recommended instructions for cheats that worked around the technical flaws.

CGW said the in-game combat became a confusing mess once allies became involved, in part due to poor Artificial Intelligence (AI) that caused them to use powers liberally and become low on blood as a result. The AI was considered to be insufficient for the game; pathfinding failures meant allies would become stuck on environmental objects or each other during combat, use up their costliest abilities on enemies regardless of their threat, and were poor at staying alive in battle. Enemies were similarly dismissed for either not noticing the playable character in obvious circumstances or failing to respond to attacks on themselves.

Combat was also criticized; "Computer Games" called the game "little more than a hack-and-slash adventure", and said the game's focus on combat was counter to the greater focus on political intrigue and social interaction prevalent in the source "Vampire – the Masquerade" tabletop game. "ArsTechnica" said that combat was initially fun but very repetitive, and it became a chore by the later stages of the game, noting that every enemy dungeon consisted of four levels filled with identical enemies, while "Next Generation" said the number of enemies and the difficulty of defeating them often meant the playable character would run away or die. The repetitive combat was also criticized by other reviewers, who disliked that it involved repeatedly clicking on enemies until they were dead; and running away if the playable character was about to die against unending waves of enemies. Disciplines were considered helpful in adding variety to combat, but battles were too fast-paced to allow the tactical use of a wide range of powers because of the inability to pause the combat to allow the issuing of orders.

Game Revolution said the multiplayer feature was a revelation and worth the cost of the game alone. "Computer Games" said it was innovative and may serve as an inspiration for future games. "PC Gamer" said the multiplayer mode was the redeeming factor of the game, though it was still marred by bugs. Others noted that aspects of the multiplayer interface were insufficient, such as the inability to store custom dialog, requiring the Storyteller to type text in real time during gameplay.

At the 1999 <a href="Game%20Critics%20Awards">Game Critics Awards</a>, "Redemption" was named Best RPG ahead of the first-person action RPG, "Deus Ex". In 2014, Gameranx listed the game as one of the 22 Best Vampire games of all time.
