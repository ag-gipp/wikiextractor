Black-necked grebe

The black-necked grebe ("Podiceps nigricollis"), known in North America as the eared grebe, is a member of the <a href="grebe">grebe</a> <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> of water birds. It was described in 1831 by <a href="Christian%20Ludwig%20Brehm">Christian Ludwig Brehm</a>. There are currently three accepted subspecies, including the <a href="nominate%20subspecies">nominate subspecies</a>. Its breeding plumage features a distinctive ochre-coloured plumage that extends behind its eye and over its ear coverts. The rest of the upper parts, including the head, neck, and breast, are coloured black to blackish brown. The flanks are tawny rufous to maroon-chestnut, and the abdomen is white. When in its non-breeding plumage, this bird has greyish-black upper parts, including the top of the head and a vertical stripe on the back of the neck. The flanks are also greyish-black. The rest of the body is a white or whitish colour. The juvenile has more brown in its darker areas. The subspecies "californicus" can be distinguished from the nominate by the former's usually longer bill. The other subspecies, "P. n. gurneyi", can be differentiated by its greyer head and upper parts and by its smaller size. "P. n. gurneyi" can also be told apart by its lack of a non-breeding plumage. This species is present in parts of <a href="Africa">Africa</a>, <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>, and the <a href="Americas">Americas</a>.

The black-necked grebe uses multiple foraging techniques. Insects, which make up the majority of this bird's diet, are caught either on the surface of the water or when they are in flight. It occasionally practices <a href="foliage%20gleaning">foliage gleaning</a>. This grebe dives to catch <a href="crustaceans">crustaceans</a>, <a href="mollusc">mollusc</a>s, tadpoles, and small frogs and fish. When <a href="moult">moult</a>ing at saline lakes, this bird feeds mostly on <a href="brine%20shrimp">brine shrimp</a>. The black-necked grebe makes a floating cup nest on an open lake. The nest cup is covered with a disc. This nest is located both in colonies and by itself. During the breeding season, which varies depending on location, this species will lay one (sometimes two) <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> of three to four eggs. The number of eggs is sometimes larger due to conspecific <a href="brood%20parasitism">brood parasitism</a>. After a 21-day incubation period, the eggs hatch, and then the nest is deserted. After about 10 days, the parents split up the chicks between themselves. After this, the chicks become independent in about 10 days, and fledge in about three weeks.

Although it generally avoids flight, the black-necked grebe travels as far as during <a href="Bird%20migration">migration</a>. In addition, it becomes flightless for two months after completing a migration to reach an area where it can safely moult. During this moult, the grebe can double in weight. The migrations to reach these areas are dangerous, sometimes with thousands of grebe deaths. In spite of this, it is classified as a <a href="least%20concern%20species">least concern species</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20the%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for the Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN). It is likely that this is the most numerous grebe in the world. There are potential threats to it, such as oil spills, but these are not likely to present a major risk to the overall population.

This species was first described by <a href="Carl%20Ludwig%20Hablitz">Carl Ludwig Hablitz</a> in 1783 as "Colymbus caspicus", from a bird in <a href="Bandar-e%20Anzali">Bandar-e Anzali</a>. This was originally thought to be a synonym for the <a href="horned%20grebe">horned grebe</a>, until <a href="Erwin%20Stresemann">Erwin Stresemann</a> discovered that the description applied more to the black-necked grebe in 1948. Before this, the earliest description was thought to be by <a href="Christian%20Ludwig%20Brehm">Christian Ludwig Brehm</a> in 1831, who gave this bird its current scientific name of "Podiceps nigricollis" from a German bird. To resolve this, the <a href="International%20Commission%20on%20Zoological%20Nomenclature">International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature</a> suppressed the name "C. caspicus". The genus name "Dytes" is sometimes used for this species, a placement which was formalized by <a href="Robert%20Ridgway">Robert Ridgway</a> in 1881.

This bird is closely related to the <a href="silvery%20grebe">silvery grebe</a> and the <a href="Junin%20grebe">Junin grebe</a>. The extinct <a href="Colombian%20grebe">Colombian grebe</a> is sometimes considered to be a subspecies of this species, in addition to three other extant subspecies:

The generic name, "Podiceps", comes from two Latin words: "podicis", meaning "vent" or "anus" and "pes" meaning "foot". This is a reference to the attachment point of the bird's legs—at the extreme back end of its body. The specific epithet "nigricollis" is Latin for "black-necked": "niger" means "black" and "collis" means "neck". The subspecies epithet "californicus" comes from "California", while "gurneyi" comes from the name of British <a href="ornithologist">ornithologist</a> <a href="John%20Henry%20Gurney%20Sr.">John Henry Gurney Sr.</a>

"Black-necked grebe" has been designated the official name by the <a href="International%20Ornithological%20Committee">International Ornithological Committee</a> (IOC). Both common names for this species refer to features visible when the bird is in its breeding plumage; in such plumage, it has an all-black neck and a spray of golden plumes on each side of its head. The name "eared grebe" is nearly a century older than the name "black-necked grebe". The latter was first used in 1912 by Ernst Hartert, in an effort to bring the common name of the species in line with its scientific name. The name "eared grebe" is still used in North America to refer to this bird.

The black-necked grebe usually measures between in length and weighs . The <a href="nominate%20subspecies">nominate subspecies</a> in breeding plumage has the head, neck, breast, and upper parts coloured black to blackish brown, with the exception of the <a href="ochre">ochre</a>-coloured fan of feathers extending behind the eye over the eye-coverts and sides of the nape. This eye is mostly red, with a narrow and paler yellow ring on the inner parts of the eye and an orange-yellow to pinkish-red . The thin, upturned bill, on the other hand, is black, and is connected to the eye by a blackish line starting at the . Sometimes, the foreneck can be found to be mostly tinged brown. The is blackish to drab brown in colour and has a white patch formed by the secondaries and part of the inner primaries. The flanks are coloured tawny rufous to maroon-chestnut and have the occasional blackish fleck. The and abdomen is white, with an exception to the former being the dark tertials and the mostly pale grey-brown outer primaries. The legs are a dark greenish grey. The sexes are similar.

In non-breeding plumage, the nominate has greyish-black upper parts, cap, nape, and hindneck, with the colour on the upper portion of the latter being contained in a vertical stripe. The dark colour of the cap reaches below the eye and can be seen, diffused, to the ear-coverts. Behind the ear-coverts on the sides of the neck, there are white ovals. The rest of the neck is grey to brownish-grey in colour and has white that varies in amount. The breast is white, and the abdomen is whitish. The flanks are coloured in a mix of blackish-grey with white flecks. The colour of the bill when not breeding differs from that of the breeding plumage, with the former being significantly more grey.

The juvenile black-necked grebe is similar to the non-breeding adult. There are differences, however, including the fact that the dark areas are usually more brownish in the juvenile, with less black. The are often tinged pale grey, with whitish marks behind the eye. On the sides of the head and upper neck, there is a buffy or tawny tinge. The chick is downy and has a blackish-grey head with stripes and spots that are white or pale buff-grey. The throat and foreneck are largely pale. The upper parts are mostly dark grey in colour, and the abdomen is white.

The subspecies "californicus" usually has a longer bill compared to the nominate, and has brown-grey inner primaries during the breeding season. When not breeding, the nominate has diffuse and pale lores less often than "Podiceps nigricollis californicus". The other subspecies, "P. n. gurneyi", is the smallest of the three subspecies, in addition to having a greyer head and upper parts. The adult of this subspecies also has a rufous-brown tinge on its lesser wing-coverts. It also lacks a non-breeding plumage, in addition to the tufts on the side of its head being paler.

When breeding, the black-necked grebe gives a quiet "ooeek" that ascends in pitch from an already high pitch. This call is also used as a territorial call, in addition to a low and fast trill, which itself is also used during courtship. Another call is a short "puuii" or "wit". This grebe is silent when it is not the breeding season and when it is feeding or resting.

This species breeds in vegetated areas of freshwater <a href="lake">lake</a>s across Europe, <a href="Asia">Asia</a>, Africa, northern <a href="South%20America">South America</a> and the <a href="Southwestern%20United%20States">southwest</a> and <a href="Western%20United%20States">western</a> United States. After breeding, this bird <a href="bird%20migration">migrates</a> to saline lakes to moult. Then, after completing the moult and waiting for sometimes several months, it migrates to winter in places such as the south-western <a href="Palearctic">Palearctic</a> and the eastern parts of both Africa and Asia. It also winters in southern Africa, another place where it breeds. In the <a href="Americas">Americas</a>, it winters as far south as <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>, although the wintering population there is mainly restricted to islands in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20California">Gulf of California</a>, the <a href="Salton%20Sea">Salton Sea</a>, and <a href="Baja%20California">Baja California</a>. When not breeding, its habitat is primarily saline lakes and coastal <a href="estuaries">estuaries</a>.

This grebe is highly <a href="Social%20animal">gregarious</a>, usually forming large colonies when breeding and large flocks when not.

This species builds its floating nest in the usually shallow water of open lakes. The nest itself is anchored to the lake by plants. It is built by both the male and female and made out of plant matter. Most of it is submerged, with the bottom of the shallow cup usually being level with the water. Above the cup, there is a flat disc. This grebe nests both in colonies and by itself. When it does not nest by itself, it will often nest in mixed-species colonies that are made up of birds such as <a href="black-headed%20gull">black-headed gull</a>s, <a href="duck">duck</a>s, and various other <a href="waterbird">waterbird</a>s. The space between the nests in these colonies is often . Whether it nests in colonies or not has an effect on the dimensions of the nest. When the bird is not in a colony, the nest has an average diameter of , although this can vary, with nests ranging from about to over . This is compared to nests in colonies, which have an average diameter of about . It is suggested that rarely some pairs of this grebe will steward over multiple nests when in colonies.

Pair formation in the black-necked grebe usually starts during pauses in the migration to the breeding grounds, although it occasionally occurs before, in wintering pairs. This pair formation continues after this grebe has arrived to its breeding grounds. Courtship occurs when it arrives at the breeding lake. The displays are performed in the middle of the lake. There is no territory involved in courting; individuals used the whole area of the lake. When advertising for a mate, a black-necked grebe will approach other black-necked grebes with its body fluffed out and its neck erect. It closes its beak to perform a call, "poo-eee-chk", with the last note only barely audible. Courtship generally stops at the start of nesting.

In the Northern Hemisphere, this bird breeds from April to August. In east Africa, the breeding season is at least from January to February, while in southern Africa, the breeding season is from October to April.

The black-necked grebe is <a href="socially%20monogamous">socially monogamous</a>. Conspecific or intraspecific <a href="brood%20parasitism">brood parasitism</a>, where the female lays eggs in the nest of others of their own species is common with nearly 40% of nests being parasitized on average. In terms of territory, this grebe will only defend its nest site.

This grebe lays a <a href="Clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a>, and sometimes two clutches, of three to four chalky greenish or bluish eggs. Nests that have been parasitized, however, will have two more eggs on average, even though the amount that the host lays is about the same no matter if it has been parasitized or not. The eggs, although they are initially immaculate, do get stained by the plant matter that the nest is built out of. The eggs measure on average and are incubated by both parents for about 21 days. The laying date of the eggs is somewhat synchronized, with birds in small colonies having the laying dates spread out by just a few days, compared to large colonies, where the laying date is spread out over more than 10 days.

After the chicks hatch, the birds will desert their nest. Even though the young can swim and dive during this time, they rarely do, instead staying on the parents' backs for four days after hatching. This behaviour is present in all grebes, and is likely to have evolved because it reduces travel costs, specifically those back to the nest to brood the chicks and give them food. After about 10 days, the parents split the chicks up, with each parent taking care of about half of the brood. After this split, the chicks are independent in about 10 days, and fledge in about three weeks.

When disturbed while incubating, this bird usually (just under 50% of the time) partly covers its eggs with nest material when the disruption is not sudden, but a bird with an incomplete clutch usually does not attempt to cover the eggs. When the disruption is sudden, on the other hand, the black-necked grebe usually (just under 50% of the time) does not cover its eggs. In comparison, other species of grebes cover up their eggs when leaving the nest. Predation is usually not the primary cause of egg loss, with most nesting failures occurring after the chicks have hatched. A major cause of this is the chilling of the young.

The black-necked grebe forages mainly by diving from the water, with dives usually lasting less than 30 seconds. These dives are usually shorter in time when in more shallow water. In between dives, this grebe rests for an average of 15 seconds. When feeding on <a href="brine%20shrimp">brine shrimp</a> at hypersaline lakes, it likely uses its large tongue to block the oral cavity. It is hypothesized that it then crushes prey against its palate to remove excess water. It also forages by <a href="gleaning%20%28birds%29">gleaning</a> foliage, plucking objects off of the surface of water, having its head submerged while swimming, and sometimes capturing flying insects.

This grebe eats mostly insects, of both adult and <a href="larval">larval</a> stages, as well as <a href="crustaceans">crustaceans</a>, <a href="mollusc">mollusc</a>s, tadpoles, and small frogs and fish. When <a href="moult">moult</a>ing at lakes with high salinity, although, this bird feeds mostly on brine shrimp. The behaviour of black-necked grebes changes in response to the availability of brine shrimp; bodies of water with more shrimp have more grebes, and grebes spend more time foraging when the amount of shrimp and the water temperature decreases.

The young are fed one at a time by the parents, with one bird carrying the young while the other feeds it. The young take food by grabbing it, with their beaks, from their parents, or by grabbing food dropped into the water. When a young bird cannot grab the food, then the adults submerge their bill into the water and shake their bill to break up the food.

When breeding is over, the black-necked grebe usually partakes in a moult migration to saline lakes. It especially prefers lakes with large numbers of invertebrate prey, so that it can fatten up while moulting and before going on its winter migration. Some birds, although, moult when on the breeding grounds, but most do not moult until the end of the moult migration. This migration is dangerous, with hundreds and sometimes thousands of birds being killed by snowstorms when traveling to places such as <a href="Mono%20Lake">Mono Lake</a>.

When it finishes its moult migration, this bird moults its <a href="Flight%20feather">remiges</a> between August and September, which makes it unable to fly. This moult is preceded by an increase in weight. During the moult, the breast muscles atrophy. When the moult is completed, this grebe continues to gain weight, often more than doubling its original weight. This additional fat is used to power the black-necked grebe's overnight fall migration to its wintering grounds. The fat is most concentrated in the abdomen, second most in the thorax, and least in the chest. This bird usually starts its migration earlier when shrimp is more abundant and when the moulting lake is at a higher than average temperature. It generally leaves on a clear night with lower than average surface temperatures.

This grebe is one of the most inefficient fliers among birds. Generally, it avoids flying at all costs and reserves long-distance flight exclusively for migration. This is combined with the fact that this bird is flightless for two months of the year during its moult. However, when migrating, it travels as much as to reach rich feeding areas that are exploited by few other species. In flight, the shape of this grebe is like a <a href="loon">loon</a>: straight neck, legs trailing, and wings beating often.

When diving, this bird pulls its head back and then arches it forward into the water, with the body following and a slight springing. The legs only start moving when they are underwater. When swimming on the surface of the water, the body of this grebe is relatively high, although none of the underparts are seen. The neck is held straight up in a relaxed manner, with the bill being held forward and parallel to the water. Each of the feet perform strong alternating strokes.

Large-scaled deaths (such as 150,000 birds on the Salton Sea in 1992) from <a href="erysipelas">erysipelas</a>, avian cholera, <a href="avian%20botulism">avian botulism</a>, and <a href="West%20Nile%20virus">West Nile virus</a> have been recorded in the past. In 2013 at the Great Salt Lake, for example, there was an outbreak of West Nile virus that could be the largest recorded in birds in the US. The cause of the outbreak and modes of transmission are unknown, but there has been speculation about the latter. Since West Nile virus is able to survive in brine shrimp and, for a temporary time, the water of the Great Salt Lake around the temperature it was when the die-off happened. Thus, it is likely that grebes could become infected by eating diseased shrimp or being in contaminated water. It is also theorized that West Nile virus could be transmitted among grebes through contact with the excrement of an infected grebe. Avian cholera, another disease that can cause large scale die-offs in this grebe, can be brought on by unknown <a href="biotoxin">biotoxin</a>s, pathogens, and problems with feather waterproofing.

As of 2016, the black-necked grebe is classified as least concern by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN). The trend of the population is uncertain, as some populations are decreasing, whereas others are stable, have an uncertain trend, or are increasing. The justification for the current classification of this species is its very large population (estimated around 3.9–4.2 million individuals) combined with a large estimated extent of occurrence (about 155 million km (60 million sq mi)). This grebe is probably the most numerous grebe in the world.

Unknown <a href="biotoxin">biotoxin</a>s, pathogens, and the impairment of feather waterproofing can lead to <a href="hypothermia">hypothermia</a> and <a href="avian%20cholera">avian cholera</a>. Since this grebe usually winters on the coast, it is also vulnerable to oil pollution. Large-scale disease, such as avian cholera, could threaten the species. These and other factors, such as human disturbance, including collisions with power transmission lines, contribute to declining populations in certain areas. This species used to be threatened in North America by the millinery industry, which helped facilitate the hunting of the birds, and egg collectors. Although this is true, this grebe is hunted in the <a href="Gilan%20Province">Gilan Province</a> in Iran, for both commercial and recreational purposes. However, there is no evidence suggesting that these threats could result in a significant risk for the overall population.

Shergar

Shergar (3 March 1978 – c. February 1983) was an Irish-bred, British-trained <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a> <a href="racehorse">racehorse</a>. After a very successful season in 1981 he was retired to the Ballymany Stud in <a href="County%20Kildare">County Kildare</a>, Ireland. In 1983 he was stolen from the stud, and a ransom of £2 million was demanded; it was not paid, and negotiations were soon broken off by the thieves. In 1999 a <a href="Supergrass%20%28informant%29">supergrass</a>, formerly in the <a href="Provisional%20Irish%20Republican%20Army">Provisional Irish Republican Army</a> (IRA), stated they stole the horse. The IRA has never admitted any role in the theft. 

The <a href="Aga%20Khan%20IV">Aga Khan</a>, Shergar's owner, sent the horse for training in Britain in 1979 and 1980. Shergar began his first season of racing in September 1980 and ran two races that year, where he won one and came second in the other. In 1981 he rode in six races, winning five of them. In June that year he won the <a href="1981%20Epsom%20Derby">202nd Epsom Derby</a> by ten <a href="Horse%20length">lengths</a>—the longest winning margin in the race's history. Three weeks later he won the <a href="Irish%20Derby">Irish Sweeps Derby</a> by four lengths; a month after that he won the <a href="King%20George%20VI%20and%20Queen%20Elizabeth%20Stakes">King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes</a> by four lengths. In his final race of the year he came in fourth, and the Aga Khan took the decision to retire him to <a href="Stud%20%28animal%29">stud</a> in Ireland.

After Shergar's <a href="Epsom%20Derby">Epsom Derby</a> win, the Aga Khan sold 40 shares in the horse, valuing it at £10 million. Retaining six shares, he created an owner's syndicate with the remaining 34 members. Shergar was stolen from the Aga Khan's stud farm by an armed gang on 8 February 1983. Negotiations were conducted with the thieves, but the gang broke off all communication after four days when the syndicate did not accept as true the proof provided that the horse was still alive. In 1999 <a href="Sean%20O%27Callaghan">Sean O'Callaghan</a>, a former member of the IRA, published details of the theft and stated that it was an IRA operation to raise money for arms. He said that very soon after the theft, Shergar had panicked and damaged his leg, which led to him being killed by the gang. An investigation by "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Telegraph">The Sunday Telegraph</a>" concluded that the horse was shot four days after the theft.

No arrests have ever been made in relation to the theft. Shergar's body has never been recovered or identified; it is likely that the body was buried near Aughnasheelin, near <a href="Ballinamore">Ballinamore</a>, <a href="County%20Leitrim">County Leitrim</a>. In honour of Shergar, the <a href="Shergar%20Cup">Shergar Cup</a> was inaugurated in 1999. His story has been made into two screen dramatisations, several books and two documentaries.
Shergar was a <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a> <a href="Bay%20%28horse%29">bay</a> <a href="Colt%20%28horse%29">colt</a> with a white <a href="Horse%20markings%23Facial%20markings">blaze</a>, four white <a href="Horse%20markings%23Leg%20markings">socks</a> and a <a href="Horse%20markings%23Other%20identifying%20features">wall (blue) eye</a>. He was foaled on 3 March 1978 at Sheshoon—the private <a href="Stud%20%28animal%29">stud</a> of the <a href="Aga%20Khan%20IV">Aga Khan IV</a>—near the <a href="Curragh%20Racecourse">Curragh Racecourse</a> in <a href="County%20Kildare">County Kildare</a>, Ireland. Shergar was sired by <a href="Great%20Nephew">Great Nephew</a>, a British stallion whose wins included the <a href="Prix%20du%20Moulin">Prix du Moulin</a> and <a href="Prix%20Dollar">Prix Dollar</a> in France in 1967. Great Nephew's other progeny included <a href="Grundy%20%28horse%29">Grundy</a>, <a href="Mrs%20Penny">Mrs Penny</a> and <a href="Tolmi">Tolmi</a>. Shergar's dam was Sharmeen, a seventh-generation descendent of <a href="Mumtaz%20Mahal%20%28horse%29">Mumtaz Mahal</a>, a horse that is described by the <a href="National%20Sporting%20Library%20%26amp%3B%20Museum">National Sporting Library</a> as "one of the most important broodmares of the 20th Century".

In 1978 the Aga Khan—the leader of <a href="Nizari">Nizari Ismailism</a>, philanthropist and horse owner—announced he would send some of his <a href="Yearling%20%28horse%29">yearlings</a> for training in England. For a trainer, he chose <a href="Michael%20Stoute">Michael Stoute</a>, who was based at <a href="Newmarket%2C%20Suffolk">Newmarket</a>. Stoute had a good year in 1978, and had trained the winners of the <a href="Epsom%20Oaks">Oaks</a>, <a href="Irish%20Oaks">Irish Oaks</a> and <a href="Yorkshire%20Oaks">Yorkshire Oaks</a> with <a href="Fair%20Salinia">Fair Salinia</a>, and the <a href="Ascot%20Gold%20Cup">Gold Cup</a> with <a href="Shangamuzo">Shangamuzo</a>. Shergar was sent into training with Stoute in 1979, as the Aga Khan's second year of sending horses to England.

According to Stoute and Ghislain Drion—the manager of the Aga Khan's Irish studs—Shergar was easy to <a href="Horse%20training">break</a>, and had a good temperament. He responded very well to training, particularly in September 1980, when the jockey <a href="Lester%20Piggott">Lester Piggott</a> rode him in the run-up to Shergar's debut race.

On 19 September 1980 Shergar ran his first race, the <a href="Haynes%2C%20Hanson%20and%20Clark%20Conditions%20Stakes">Kris Plate</a>, with Piggott as his jockey. The race was open to two-year-old colts and <a href="gelding">gelding</a>s over a straight at <a href="Newbury%20Racecourse">Newbury</a>. Listed as favourite with <a href="Sports%20betting%23odds">odds</a> of 11–8, he kept in behind the leaders before opening up and winning by <a href="Horse%20length">lengths</a>. Richard Baerlein, the racing correspondent for "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>", thought Shergar's run was the best from a two-year-old that season. After the race Stoute said the horse would run one more race that year to gain experience, before resting until the following year.

Shergar's second race was the <a href="Racing%20Post%20Trophy">William Hill Futurity Stakes</a> at <a href="Doncaster%20Racecourse">Doncaster</a>, run on 25 October 1980. He was again ridden by Piggott, with odds of 5–2 in a very experienced field of seven. Shergar sat behind the pace-setting leader for much of the race, and when that horse faded, the running was taken up by <a href="Beldale%20Flutter">Beldale Flutter</a>. Shergar challenged for the lead, but Beldale Flutter pulled away and won by lengths; Shergar came in second. Following the race, Michael Seely, the racing correspondent of "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", thought Shergar's run was significant, and that he was "a magnificent stamp of a horse" whose odds of 25–1 for the following year's <a href="Epsom%20Derby">Derby</a> were worth considering.

Over late 1980 and early 1981 Shergar filled out and was stronger by April 1981. Stoute had decided that Shergar should run in <a href="1981%20Epsom%20Derby">that year's Derby</a>, and planned the season accordingly. The first race to prepare him was the <a href="Sandown%20Classic%20Trial">Guardian Newspaper Classic Trial</a>, run at <a href="Sandown%20Park%20Racecourse">Sandown</a> on 25 April 1981, where he was ridden by <a href="Walter%20Swinburn">Walter Swinburn</a>. In a 9-horse, -mile (2.0 km) race, Shergar raised his pace after a mile and won by 10 lengths. Baerlein had written in his column before the race that at 25–1, the odds for Shergar to win the Derby were excellent. After the win, he noted them shortening to 8–1, where, "the bet is still worth pressing"; he continued "If ... [Shergar] wins his next race at Chester or the Ladbroke Lingfield Trial as easily, he will be down to less than 4-1. Surely this is the time to bet like men."

As further training for the Derby, Stoute decided that Shergar needed practice on a left-hand cornered course; he selected <a href="Chester%20Racecourse">Chester</a>, where the <a href="Chester%20Vase">Chester Vase</a> was run on 5 May 1981. After keeping pace with the leaders, with half a mile to go, Swinburn urged Shergar to increase speed, and he did, overtaking the leaders and going clear to win by 12 lengths.
On 3 June 1981 Shergar ran in the Derby. Set over a  mile (2.4 km) course at the <a href="Epsom%20Downs%20Racecourse">Epsom Downs Racecourse</a> in Surrey, the Derby is a <a href="Conditions%20races">Group 1</a> <a href="Flat%20racing">flat</a> race open to three-year-old Thoroughbred colts and <a href="Filly">fillies</a>. After the top of the uphill straight start of the course, Shergar was well-placed and moving through the other runners. At Tattenham Corner—the final bend of the course—Shergar took the front of the race and opened up a lead over the others. Commentating on the race, <a href="Peter%20Bromley">Peter Bromley</a> informed listeners that "there's only one horse in it – you need a telescope to see the rest!" Swinburn eased off the pace with two <a href="furlong">furlong</a>s to go, and won by ten lengths. It was the largest winning margin of any Epsom Derby. John Matthias, the jockey of the second-placed horse <a href="Glint%20of%20Gold">Glint of Gold</a>, said that "I thought I'd achieved my life's ambition. Only then did I discover there was another horse on the horizon." In the light of Shergar's run of wins, particularly the Derby, Baerlein wrote that the horse was one of the finest he had seen.

While out on the gallops on 15 June, Shergar threw his rider, ran through a hedge onto the road and trotted along to the local village. He was spotted by a local resident, who followed the horse until it stopped to graze on a hedge, and then led him back to the stables. Shergar was unharmed during the event, and Stoute recalled "it's very lucky nothing happened to him; there's a crossing there, and it's a difficult thing".

By the time the <a href="Irish%20Derby">Irish Derby</a> was run at the Curragh, on 27 June 1981, Swinburn was suspended following an infringement at <a href="Royal%20Ascot">Royal Ascot</a>, so Piggott returned to ride Shergar. At the half-way point in the race, Shergar was in third place, but increased his pace to take the lead with three furlongs to go. He slowed during the last furlong, and won by four lengths. As the horse approached the line, <a href="Michael%20O%27Hehir">Michael O'Hehir</a>, the commentator, informed viewers that "He's winning it so easily; it's Shergar first and the rest are nowhere". After the race Piggott told reporters that he had no doubt that Shergar would win as the horse never struggled in the race. He also said that Shergar was one of the best horses he had ever raced on.
Following Shergar's Epsom Derby win, a group of US horse owners had offered $40 million to syndicate the horse. The Aga Khan turned down the offer, and instead decided to syndicate Shergar for £10 million at £250,000 for each of the forty shares—a record price at the time; the Aga Khan kept six shares for himself and the others were sold individually to buyers from nine countries. The shareholders had the option each year of selecting a mare to be <a href="mating">covered</a>—or of selling that option on. The <a href="Stud%20%28animal%29%23Stud%20fees">stud fees</a> were £60–80,000 per cover, which meant that shareholders could expect to make a profit from stud within four years.

Shergar had a break of almost a month until he ran in the <a href="King%20George%20VI%20and%20Queen%20Elizabeth%20Stakes">King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes</a> at Ascot on 25 July 1981. The race was slow-paced to start and Shergar was boxed in by other horses, but found a way out by the time the leaders had reached the final straight, and accelerated to win by four lengths. For Baerlein, the race showed that Shergar was the best horse he had ever seen race; Michael Phillips, the racing correspondent for "The Times", wrote that the win "proved that Shergar is a cut above the average but not exceptional". Phillips continued that Shergar "failed to fill me, and many more besides, with the magic that was in the air after <a href="Nijinsky%20%28horse%29">Nijinsky</a> and <a href="Mill%20Reef">Mill Reef</a> had won the same race".

The Aga Khan and Stoute considered entering Shergar into the <a href="Prix%20de%20l%27Arc%20de%20Triomphe">Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe</a> that autumn, but decided that he needed one more race to prepare. They entered him into what would be his final race, the <a href="St%20Leger%20Stakes">St Leger Stakes</a> at Doncaster on 12 September 1981, with Swinburn as the jockey. Ten days before the race, a story was published in the racing newspaper "<a href="Sporting%20Life%20%28British%20newspaper%29">Sporting Life</a>" that Shergar had not been practising well and had become "mulish"; Stoute stated that the rumours were untrue. Shergar was running well in the race, although the soft ground was not to his liking, but on the final straight, when Swinburn tried to get him to accelerate to the front, the horse would not respond. Shergar came in fourth, lengths behind <a href="Cut%20Above">Cut Above</a>, the winner.

Surprised by the manner of the loss, Stoute and the Aga Khan ran a series of tests on Shergar. All showed the horse was in good health, and he worked well in training after the race. Unwilling to risk the horse without knowing what had happened at the St Leger, the Aga Khan did not enter him into the Arc, and instead retired him to the Ballymany Stud, near the Curragh. He later explained to a racing journalist:

He was just an exceptional athlete. All through the spring and summer he completely dominated European racing in a very dramatic manner, and after he had run so uncharacteristically in the St. Leger, we knew something had gone wrong, but we didn't know what it was, so it was an easy decision to retire him before the Arc.

The Aga Khan turned down large offers to put Shergar to stud in the US, and instead chose to stand him at the Ballymany Stud in Ireland. He arrived in October 1981, and was paraded down the main street of <a href="Newbridge%2C%20County%20Kildare">Newbridge, County Kildare</a>. Milton Toby, the writer on Thoroughbred racing and equine law, judges Shergar to have been "a national hero in Ireland. ... one of the most recognizable sports personalities—horse or human—in Ireland."

In 1982—his only rutting season—Shergar covered 44 mares, from which 36 foals were produced: 17 colts and 19 fillies. Of these, three won <a href="Group%20races">Group races</a>, and the most successful of his progeny was <a href="Authaal">Authaal</a>. When sold as a <a href="weanling">weanling</a> (between six months and a year) Authaal reached 325,000 <a href="Guinea%20%28coin%29">guineas</a>. He was sold a year later, where he fetched 3.1 million guineas. In 1986 he won the <a href="Irish%20St.%20Leger">Irish St. Leger</a> by five lengths. Toby considers that Shergar's progeny were "perhaps not a disappointing first crop, but certainly below expectations for a horse with Shergar's racing prowess."

At the start of February 1983 Shergar's second stud season was about to begin, and he was in high demand, and had a full book of 55 mares to cover. He was expected to earn £1 million for the season.

On 8 February 1983, at around 8:30 pm, three men—all armed and wearing masks—entered the house of Jim Fitzgerald, the head groom at Ballymany. They were part of a group of at least six, and possibly up to nine men. One of the men said to him "We have come for Shergar. We want £2 million for him." Fitzgerald said the men were not rough, although one of them who carried a pistol was very aggressive. Fitzgerald's family were locked into a room while he was taken, at gunpoint, out to Shergar's stable and was told to put the horse in the back of a <a href="horsebox">horsebox</a>.

After the horsebox was driven away Fitzgerald was told to lie on the floor of a van, and his face was covered with a coat. He was driven around for four hours before being released near the village of <a href="Kilcock">Kilcock</a>, approximately from Ballymany. He was told not to contact the <a href="Garda%20S%C3%ADoch%C3%A1na">Garda Síochána</a>—the Irish police—or he and his family would be killed, but to wait for the gang to contact him. He was given the code phrase "King Neptune", which the gang would use to identify themselves. The men did not say that they were from the IRA, or give any other indication as to who they were, although one of the men spoke with a Northern Irish accent, and another seemed to be experienced with horses.

Fitzgerald walked on to the next village and called his brother to pick him up. On arrival back at Ballymany, he rang Ghislain Drion to inform him of the theft, and urged him not to call the police because of the threats that been made. Drion attempted to reach the Aga Khan in Switzerland to inform him, then rang Stan Cosgrove, Shergar's vet, who was also a shareholder. Cosgrove contacted a retired <a href="Irish%20Army">Irish Army</a> captain, Sean Berry, who was manager of the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association. Berry contacted Alan Dukes, a friend of his who was the serving <a href="Minister%20for%20Finance%20%28Ireland%29">Minister for Finance</a>, who suggested that Berry speak to <a href="Michael%20Noonan%20%28Fine%20Gael%20politician%29">Michael Noonan</a>, the <a href="Minister%20for%20Justice%20and%20Equality">Minister for Justice</a>. Noonan and Dukes told him to call the Gardaí. By 4:00 am Drion had managed to contact the Aga Khan, who told him to phone the Gardaí straight away. The force were then contacted, but it was eight hours after Shergar had been stolen and any possible trail had already gone cold.

The Aga Khan had several reasons for non-payment of the ransom, including that he was only one of 35 members, and could not negotiate or pay on behalf of the others. He was unsure whether Shergar would be returned even if the money was paid, and concerned that, if the kidnappers' demands were met, it would make every high-value horse in Ireland a target for future thefts. The shareholders were divided on the approach. Brian Sweeney, a veteran of the American horseracing industry thought that "if you ask a mother who has had a child that has been kidnapped if a ransom should be paid, I think the answer would be 'yes, and quickly'"; another shareholder, <a href="Edward%20Stanley%2C%2018th%20Earl%20of%20Derby">Lord Derby</a>, disagreed and said "if ransom money is paid for this horse, then there is a danger of other horses being kidnapped in the years to come – and that simply cannot be tolerated".

The first phone call from the thieves was on the night Shergar was stolen; Fitzgerald was not back at Ballymany by that time, and had not had the chance to tell the news of the theft to anyone. The call was to Jeremy Maxwell, a horse trainer based in Northern Ireland. The caller demanded £40,000, although this figure was later raised to £52,000. Maxwell was told that the negotiations would only be with three British horse racing journalists, <a href="Derek%20Thompson%20%28sports%20commentator%29">Derek Thompson</a> and <a href="John%20Oaksey">John Oaksey</a> of <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a> and Peter Campling from "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">The Sun</a>". The men were told to be at the <a href="Europa%20Hotel%2C%20Belfast">Europa Hotel</a> in central Belfast by the Thursday evening; the Europa was known as the most bombed hotel in Europe after having suffered multiple bomb attacks during <a href="the%20Troubles">the Troubles</a>.

When the three sports journalists arrived at the Europa, they were contacted by phone and told to go to Maxwell's house to await further calls. On orders from the police, Thompson kept the person talking for as long as possible, but the caller rang off at 80 seconds – before the call could be traced. There were a series of calls to Maxwell's house later that night, and at 1:30 am Thompson managed to keep the caller talking for over 90 seconds, which would have been enough to trace the call; he was told that the person who was doing the call intercepts had finished his shift at midnight and gone home. At 7:00 am on 12 February another call was put through to the Maxwell's house, which said that things had gone wrong, and that Shergar was dead.

Although a committee put together by the syndicate to co-ordinate their response later considered that this was a hoax, Toby argues that as the call about the theft preceded Fitzgerald's return to Ballymany—i.e. before anyone knew about the theft—and as the callers used the code phrase "King Neptune" in their communications, it is more likely that the calls, and the ensuing focus on the high-profile activity in Belfast, were undertaken to distract the authorities from what was happening with Shergar elsewhere.

On 9 February the thieves opened a second line of negotiation, contacting Ballymany Stud directly and speaking to Drion. The call, which came in at 4:05 pm, was short. Drion was not a fluent speaker of English and struggled to understand the Irish accent of the caller; the caller similarly had problems with Drion's heavy French pronunciation. Ninety minutes later, the caller tried again, with Drion asking him to speak slowly. A demand of £2 million was made for the return of Shergar, and for a contact number in France, through which further negotiations could be made. Drion provided the number of the Aga Khan's French office.
The syndicate which owned Shergar brought in the <a href="risk%20and%20strategic%20consulting">risk and strategic consulting</a> firm <a href="Control%20Risks">Control Risks</a> to handle the negotiations. They negotiated from the Paris office, with a series of telephone calls over four days. On Friday 11 February the negotiators demanded proof that Shergar was still alive, as there had been some speculation in the press that Shergar was dead. The thieves said that a representative of the syndicate should go to the Crofton Hotel in Dublin and ask for any messages for "Johnny Logan"—the name of an <a href="Johnny%20Logan%20%28singer%29">Irish singer</a>. Stan Cosgrove went to the hotel and asked for any messages. Armed members of the <a href="Special%20Detective%20Unit">Special Detective Unit</a>—the domestic <a href="security%20agency">security agency</a> of the Gardaí—were present in an undercover role. No message was delivered, and Cosgrove returned home after waiting. Shortly afterwards the negotiators received a phone call from the thieves, angry at the presence of the police, and threatening that if any members of the gang were captured or killed, the negotiators and police would be murdered in retribution.

On Saturday 12 February the thieves contacted the negotiators and said that proof had been left at the Rosnaree Hotel. When this was picked up, it contained several <a href="Instant%20film">polaroid</a> pictures showing Shergar; some of the pictures showed the horse's head next to a copy of "<a href="The%20Irish%20News">The Irish News</a>", dated 11 February. Cosgrove saw the photograph and confirmed that "it definitely was him", although he added "It wasn't proof that the horse was alive ... at that point ... you'd want to get much more definite evidence ... if you'd have seen the complete horse it would have been different, but this was just the head."

In a telephone call from the thieves to the negotiators at 10:40 pm on 12 February, it was explained that the syndicate were not satisfied with the pictures of the horse, which, they explained, did not constitute enough proof. The caller told the negotiators "If you're not satisfied, that's it". The call was ended, and the thieves never made any further contact. The syndicate attempted to re-establish contact with the gang, but there was no response to newspaper requests to do so.

The syndicate committee put together a report for the full syndicate, which examined the possible motives behind the theft. They concluded that the theft of Shergar was either undertaken to create confusion and publicity, rather than obtaining money, or that the negotiations were undertaken with naivety. They reached this conclusion after taking a number of factors into account. Many of the demands were physically impossible: the ransom demand included £100 notes, which did not exist. In one call at 5:45 pm to Drion in Ballymany, he was told to deliver the £2 million to Paris before noon the following day. In a call at 5:00 pm, the Paris negotiators were told to get £2 million by the end of the night – after the Parisian banks had closed. In another call, the negotiator in Paris was told to get agreement for a ransom, but told he should not contact anyone in Ireland, despite some of the shareholders being there. It also became clear during the course of the negotiations that the gang thought that the Aga Khan was the sole owner of Shergar; they had no knowledge of the other shareholders, and did not take into account the complexity of liaising and organising all 35 shareholders into a position of agreement.

The initial police investigation was hindered by the eight-hour lapse before the crime was reported, and by a local Thoroughbred auction, which meant several horseboxes were travelling in the area. Leading the investigation was Chief Superintendent James Murphy, a highly experienced detective. In his first press conference Murphy described how he was "slightly concerned" about the theft, and told reporters that "I have no leads". His comment about a lack of leads was not truthful, as Murphy withheld much information from the media, including the police finding the <a href="Magazine%20%28firearms%29">magazine</a> for a <a href="Steyr%20MPi%2069">Steyr MPi 69</a> <a href="submachine%20gun">submachine gun</a>, which suggested a link to an IRA active service unit in South Armagh.

Murphy had a strong Irish <a href="brogue">brogue</a>, wore a <a href="trilby">trilby</a> hat and had a self-effacing sense of humour. At one press conference, he announced "A clue? That is something we haven't got". Several people claiming to have paranormal powers contacted the Gardaí with their thoughts; Murphy reported that "<a href="Divination">diviners</a>, <a href="Clairvoyance">clairvoyants</a> and <a href="Psychic">psychic persons</a> – they're in three different categories – they must be running into the fifties now". During one press conference, six photographers turned up wearing similar trilbies to the policeman; "The Times" called him a "stage Irishman". One reviewer of a documentary in 2004 called Murphy "the most richly comic copper since <a href="Inspector%20Clouseau">Inspector Clouseau</a>". After eight days with no progress, he was replaced as the public figure of the investigation, but continued to lead it.

On 16 February a description of the horsebox used by the thieves—from a description given by Fitzgerald—was released. It was either light green or light blue with no working lights and no licence plates. The huge police search of possible hiding places for Shergar—by the Gardaí in the Irish Republic and the <a href="Royal%20Ulster%20Constabulary">Royal Ulster Constabulary</a> (RUC) in Northern Ireland—found no trace of the horse or horsebox, but several <a href="Provisional%20Irish%20Republican%20Army">IRA</a> caches of arms and explosives were uncovered, leading to the loss of several <a href="safe%20house">safe house</a>s. Up to 70 detectives were working on the case at one point. Two weeks after Shergar was stolen, the police search was scaled down, although the investigation continued.

With no definite news of Shergar's whereabouts, and with the Gardaí limiting the information they released to the press, the media took to speculation to cover the story. Baerlein observes that in reporting the Shergar case, "the press speculation was remarkable for its enthusiasm and its inaccuracy over a long period of time". Such media claims included that Shergar had been stolen by <a href="Muammar%20Gaddafi">Colonel Gaddafi</a> as part of a deal to supply arms to the IRA; that, according to the <a href="Tabloid%20%28newspaper%20format%29">tabloid</a> newspaper "<a href="Sunday%20Sport">Sunday Sport</a>", Shergar was spotted being ridden by the missing <a href="John%20Bingham%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Lucan">Lord Lucan</a>; that a Middle Eastern horse breeder had stolen him for stud; and that the <a href="Mafia">Mafia</a> had undertaken the act to punish the Aga Khan over a previous sale of a horse which had gone badly.

Eight weeks after Shergar was stolen, Stan Cosgrove was approached by senior detectives within the Gardaí who introduced him to Dennis Minogue, a horse trainer. Minogue claimed to have a contact within the IRA who had shown him a photograph of Shergar, and that he could help get Shergar released for a ransom of <a href="Irish%20pound">IR£</a>80,000. The Gardaí asked Cosgrove to assist them in a <a href="sting%20operation">sting operation</a> to lure the thieves out. Cosgrove agreed, and on 20 July 1983 Detective Garda Martin Kenirons assisted the operation. He put the money in the boot of his car in a remote village, which Minogue was to collect once the horse had been released. The following day Kenirons found the boot of his car forced open and the money missing. Minogue had also disappeared, and the money was never recovered.

A subsequent internal Gardaí enquiry dismissed Kenirons from the force for breaching Gardaí regulations. In an interview in 2018 he reiterated his long-stated innocence and said "when it all went wrong, everyone jumped for the high ground. They [the senior Gardaí officers] all denied that they had anything to do with the ransom."

Shergar was insured through several different insurance companies. The <a href="Lloyd%27s%20of%20London">Lloyd's of London</a> <a href="insurance%20broker">insurance broker</a>s Hodgson McCreedy covered £3,625,000 of the total, and added a theft clause to the policy. Other shareholders—accountable for £1.5 million worth of shares—had insurance that did not include a theft clause; Cosgrove was one of the mortality-only insured members. Shareholders accounting for £3 million did not take out insurance; the Aga Khan was one of the uninsured members of the syndicate. Cosgrove was insured with the <a href="Norwich%20Union">Norwich Union</a> (now part of <a href="Aviva">Aviva</a>), who refused to pay, even when it became clear that Shergar was probably dead; the company's <a href="Legal%20liability">liability</a> was £144,000.

The 20 policies that included a theft clause were all settled in full in June 1983, even though there was a question of whether there was a need to. Terry Hall, an animal insurance insurer with Lloyd's of London, observes that while theft was clear cut, the demand of a ransom meant that the action was considered extortion, rather than theft, which meant the mortality and theft policies did not have to be paid out. Legal advice was sought by Lloyd's of London, who were told that although it was a grey area, payment was advised.

Police and intelligence sources considered the IRA as the most likely suspects behind the theft. During the 1980s, the <a href="Irish%20republicanism">Irish republican</a> movement followed the <a href="Armalite%20and%20ballot%20box%20strategy">Armalite and ballot box strategy</a>, in which electoral success was chased by <a href="Sinn%20F%C3%A9in">Sinn Féin</a>, while an armed struggle was continued by the IRA. The strategy was expensive, requiring payment for arms and explosives for the IRA, and for political activity, advertising and salaries for Sinn Féin. The annual budget for the movement was estimated at between £2 million and £5 million, and it was always under financial pressure.

In October 1981 the <a href="IRA%20Army%20Council">IRA Army Council</a>—the leadership group of the organisation—approved the kidnapping of <a href="Ben%20Dunne%20%28entrepreneur%29">Ben Dunne</a>, then head of the chain of <a href="Dunnes%20Stores">Dunnes Stores</a>. Dunne was released unharmed after a week; both the Dunne family and the Gardaí deny a ransom of £300,000 was paid. According to intelligence subsequently received by the intelligence sources, after the success of the operation, it was decided to undertake another ransom—through kidnapping or theft—this time of Shergar.

In 1999 <a href="Sean%20O%27Callaghan">Sean O'Callaghan</a>, a former member of the IRA who had been working within the organisation as a <a href="Supergrass%20%28informant%29">supergrass</a> for the Gardaí since 1980, published his autobiography. In it, he states that the plot to steal and ransom Shergar was devised by Kevin Mallon, a leading IRA member who sat on the Army Council; Mallon came up with the idea while serving time in <a href="Portlaoise%20Prison">Portlaoise Prison</a>. Mallon was put in charge of a Special Operations unit with orders to raise several million pounds, and several IRA men were taken from under O'Callaghan's control in IRA Southern Command and put into Mallon's unit. These included the IRA members Gerry Fitzgerald, Paul Stewart, Rab Butler and Nicky Kehoe.

Two weeks after Shergar's kidnap, Gerry Fitzgerald told O'Callaghan that he had been involved in the theft, and that Shergar had been killed early on in the process after the horse panicked and no-one present could cope with him. In the process the horse damaged its left leg and the decision was made to kill it. In his 1999 autobiography O'Callaghan states that Shergar "was killed within days" of the theft; in an interview for <a href="Raidi%C3%B3%20Teilif%C3%ADs%20%C3%89ireann">RTE</a>, the Irish broadcaster, in 2004, he stated that Gerry Fitzgerald "strongly suggested that Shergar had been killed within hours of his kidnap". The IRA then kept up a deception that the horse was still alive and in their care.

Kevin O'Connor, a journalist with RTE, identifies three parts of the gang: a section to undertake high-profile activity in Belfast, to focus media attention in the north; one part negotiating discreetly with the Aga Khan; and one part guarding the horse.

According to O'Callaghan, in August 1983, in an effort to raise the money that they failed to do with the Shergar theft, Fitzgerald and his group attempted to kidnap the businessman <a href="Galen%20Weston">Galen Weston</a> at his home in <a href="County%20Wicklow">County Wicklow</a>. The Gardaí had been forewarned, and took over the house while Weston was in the UK. After a gun battle, Gerry Fitzgerald, Kehoe and three others were arrested. They received long prison sentences. O'Callaghan stated that "Essentially the same team that went to kidnap Shergar went to kidnap Galen Weston".

No arrests have ever been made in relation to Shergar's theft. The IRA have never admitted any role in the theft or its aftermath. Mallon and Kehoe deny any involvement in the events. Toby raises a query over O'Callaghan's story, saying the IRA informant was "a confessed informer whose life depending on his ability to weave a convincing web of lies. Without more evidence, O'Callaghan's story ... [is] just that, an interesting story."

In 2008 a special investigation by "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Telegraph">The Sunday Telegraph</a>" obtained information from another IRA member who said that O'Callaghan had not been told the full story "because the gang was so embarrassed by what happened": a vet that the IRA had arranged to look after Shergar did not turn up because his wife threatened to leave him if he did. Once the IRA realised that the Aga Khan was not going to pay, the Army Council ordered the horse to be released. The extensive search by the Gardaí hampered any release, and Mallon thought he was under close surveillance, and that releasing the horse was too risky, so he ordered that it should be killed. The IRA source told the newspaper that two men went into the stable where Shergar was being held; one carried a machine gun:

Shergar was machine gunned to death. There was blood everywhere and the horse even slipped on his own blood. There was lots of cussin' and swearin' because the horse wouldn't die. It was a very bloody death.

Shergar's body has never been recovered or identified. Several sources, including O'Callaghan, "The Sunday Telegraph" and "The Observer" consider it likely that the body was buried near Aughnasheelin, near <a href="Ballinamore">Ballinamore</a>, <a href="County%20Leitrim">County Leitrim</a>. O'Callaghan said that as far as he knew, the remains had been buried on the farm of an IRA veteran from the 1940s, and that it would be difficult to get permission to dig on the land. Ballinamore is a town of strong republicanism, once nicknamed the "Falls Road of the South"—a reference to the <a href="Falls%20Road%2C%20Belfast">Falls Road, Belfast</a>, a highly republican area during the Troubles.

There have been several claims of horse's skeletons being that of Shergar. Des Leadon, a specialist horse vet with knowledge of equine <a href="pathology">pathology</a>, has assisted the Gardaí in several instances where a horse's remains may have been those of Shergar. He retains some strands of hair from Shergar's mane and tail which, he says, may contain sufficient <a href="DNA">DNA</a> to confirm an identification.

In 1999, in honour of Shergar, the <a href="Shergar%20Cup">Shergar Cup</a> was inaugurated at <a href="Goodwood%20Racecourse">Goodwood Racecourse</a>, in a format that put a European team of jockeys against one from the Middle East. The race was later moved to <a href="Ascot%20Racecourse">Ascot Racecourse</a> and is a competition between four teams, Great Britain and Ireland, Europe, the rest of the world and an all-women team. The winners of the competition are presented with a trophy showing Shergar; this was donated by the Aga Khan.

On the twentieth anniversary of Shergar's Derby win, a bronze statuette of the horse was presented to the winning jockey. A statue of Shergar stands in the grounds of Gilltown Stud, one of the Aga Khan's Irish stud farms.

Eurasian nuthatch

The Eurasian nuthatch or wood nuthatch ("Sitta europaea") is a small <a href="passerine">passerine</a> bird found throughout temperate Asia and in Europe, where its name is the nuthatch. Like other <a href="nuthatch">nuthatch</a>es, it is a short-tailed bird with a long bill, blue-grey upperparts and a black eye-stripe. It is a vocal bird with a repeated loud "dwip" call. There are more than 20 subspecies in three main groups; birds in the west of the range have orange-buff underparts and a white throat, those in Russia have whitish underparts, and those in the <a href="Far%20East">Far East</a> have a similar appearance to European birds, but lack the white throat.

The preferred habitat is mature <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> or mixed woodland with large, old trees, preferably <a href="oak">oak</a>. Pairs hold permanent territories, and nest in tree holes, usually old <a href="woodpecker">woodpecker</a> nests, but sometimes natural cavities. If the entrance to the hole is too large, the female plasters it with mud to reduce its size, and often coats the inside of the cavity too. The 6–9 red-speckled white eggs are laid on a deep base of pine or other wood chips.

The Eurasian nuthatch eats mainly insects, particularly <a href="caterpillar">caterpillar</a>s and <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s, although in autumn and winter its diet is supplemented with nuts and seeds. The young are fed mainly on insects, with some seeds, food items mainly being found on tree trunks and large branches. The nuthatch can forage when descending trees head first, as well as when climbing. It readily visits bird tables, eating fatty man-made food items as well as seeds. It is an inveterate hoarder, storing food year-round. Its main natural predator is the <a href="Eurasian%20sparrowhawk">Eurasian sparrowhawk</a>.

Fragmentation of woodland can lead to local losses of breeding birds, but the species' range is still expanding. It has a large population and huge breeding area, and is therefore classified by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) as being of <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a>.

The <a href="nuthatch">nuthatch</a>es are a family of similar-looking birds with short tails and wings, compact bodies and longish pointed bills. They have grey or bluish upperparts, a black eyestripe and strong feet. All are in the single <a href="genus">genus</a> "Sitta". Within the genus, the Eurasian nuthatch forms a <a href="superspecies">superspecies</a> with the <a href="chestnut-vented%20nuthatch">chestnut-vented</a>, <a href="Indian%20nuthatch">Indian</a>, <a href="chestnut-bellied%20nuthatch">chestnut-bellied</a> and <a href="Kashmir%20nuthatch">Kashmir nuthatch</a>es and has in the past been considered <a href="conspecific">conspecific</a> with all of these.

The Eurasian nuthatch was described by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in his "Systema naturae" in 1758 under its current scientific name. "Sitta" is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> name for this bird, , "sittē", and the species name, "europaea", is Latin for "European". "Nuthatch", first recorded in 1350, is derived from "nut" and a word probably related to "hack", since these birds hack at nuts they have wedged into crevices.

The fossil record for nuthatches is sparse, and in Europe is limited to the extinct "<a href="Sitta%20senogalliensis">Sitta senogalliensis</a>" from the <a href="Lower%20Miocene">Lower Miocene</a> in Italy and somewhat later material from France; the family appears to be of relatively recent origin.

There are more than 20 <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>, but the precise number is disputed. These <a href="taxon">taxa</a> can be divided into three main groups; these may have been geographically isolated from each other until relatively recently. Birds of intermediate appearance occur where the group ranges overlap.
The large, white-breasted "S. e. arctica" of north east <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a> is distinctive in appearance and <a href="gene">gene</a>tically, and may be another subspecies group or even a separate species.

The adult male of the <a href="subspecies">nominate subspecies</a>, "S. e. europaea" is long with a wingspan. It weighs . It has blue-grey upperparts, a black eye-stripe and whitish throat and underparts. The flanks and lower belly are orange-red, mottled with white on the undertail. The stout bill is dark grey with a paler area on the base of the lower <a href="mandible">mandible</a>, the <a href="iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a> is dark brown and the legs and feet are pale brown or greyish. Most other members of the "S. e. europaea" group differ only in detail from the nominate form, often with respect to the hue of the underparts, but "S. e. arctica" is quite distinctive. It is large, pale, has a white forehead and a reduced eye-stripe, and it has more white in the tail and wings than any other subspecies. Nuthatches move on trees with short leaps, and do not use their tails for support. In flight, they have a characteristic appearance, with a pointed head, round wings and a short, square tail. Their flight is fast, with wings closed between beats, and is usually of short duration.

"S. e. caesia", the most widespread of the western subspecies, has orange-buff underparts except for a white throat and cheeks. The other western forms mainly differ in the exact shade of the underparts, although some southeastern forms also show a white forehead and <a href="supercilium">supercilium</a>. "S. e. sinensis" and "S. e. formosana", of China and Taiwan respectively, have buff underparts like the western races, but have buff, instead of white, throats.

The female is similar in appearance to the male, but may be identified by her slightly paler upperparts, a browner eyestripe and a more washed-out tone to the flanks and lower belly. In the eastern form, "S. e. asiatica", some males have buff underparts like the female, and birds with this appearance are difficult to sex in the field. Young birds resemble the female, although their plumage is duller and they have paler legs. Individuals can be reliably sexed as female from about 12 days old by their paler and buffer flanks, or, in some white-breasted subspecies, by the creamier hue of their underparts.

Adults have a complete <a href="moulting">moult</a> after breeding which takes about 80 days, starting from late May onwards and finishing by late September. The moult period for Siberian birds is more compressed, running from June to mid-September. Fledged juveniles moult some of their wing <a href="covert%20feather">coverts</a> when they are about eight weeks old.

In much of its range, Eurasian is the only nuthatch present. In southeast Europe and southwest Asia, the <a href="western%20rock%20nuthatch">western</a> and <a href="eastern%20rock%20nuthatch">eastern rock nuthatch</a>es are larger and paler than the Eurasian species. They also lack white spots in the tail and are usually found in a different, stony habitat, and <a href="Kr%C3%BCper%27s%20nuthatch">Krüper's nuthatch</a> is small and has a black cap and reddish breast patch. In southwest China, the <a href="chestnut-vented%20nuthatch">chestnut-vented nuthatch</a> is very similar to the European bird, but is darker above, has less white on the face and has greyer underparts.

The Eurasian nuthatch calls frequently, usually with a loud, sharp "dwip" normally repeated twice, sometimes more often if excited. It has a shrill " sirrrr" or "tsi-si-si" alarm call, and a thin "tsit" pre-flight call. The song is a slow whistled "pee-pee-pee" with many variants, including a faster version, and may be intermingled with the call.

The song of the distinctive "S. e. arctica" is said to be noticeably different from that of its relatives, which would help to establish whether it is a full species, but there has been insufficient research into its vocalizations.

The Eurasian nuthatch's breeding range extends across temperate Eurasia from Great Britain (but not Ireland) to Japan. It is found between the July <a href="Isotherm%20%28contour%20line%29">isotherms</a>, north to about latitude 64°N in western Russia and 69°N in Siberia. It breeds south to the Mediterranean in Europe, although it is absent from the islands, other than <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>, and in most of Russia the southern boundary is around 54–55°N. In the east, the range includes most of China and Taiwan and much of Korea. It has occurred as a vagrant in Lebanon and the <a href="Channel%20Islands">Channel Islands</a>, and the nominate race has been recorded a few times in Finland where "S. e. asiatica" is the normal form.

Most populations are sedentary, apart from some post-breeding dispersal of young birds, and there is a reluctance to cross even short stretches of open water. Northern and eastern breeders are dependent on the cones of the <a href="Pinus%20sibirica">Siberian stone pine</a>, and if the crop fails many birds of the "S. e. asiatica" subspecies may move west into northern Sweden and Finland in autumn, sometimes staying to breed. Siberian "S. e. arctica" may make more limited movements south and east in winter, and "S. e. amurensis", from southeast Russia, is regular in winter in Korea.

The preferred habitat is mature woodland with large, old trees, which provide extensive growth for foraging and nesting holes. In Europe, <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> or mixed forest is favoured, particularly when containing <a href="oak">oak</a>. Parks, old orchards and other wooded habitats may be occupied as long as they have at least a block of suitable trees. Particularly in mountains, old <a href="spruce">spruce</a> and <a href="pine">pine</a> forests are used, and pine is also favoured in Taiwan. In most of Russia, <a href="conifer">conifer</a>s are used for nesting, but population densities are relatively low. Moroccan birds nest in oak, <a href="Atlas%20cedar">Atlas cedar</a> and <a href="fir">fir</a>. Unusual habitats include dwarf <a href="juniper">juniper</a> in Mongolia and rocky terrain in a limited part of southern Siberia.

The Eurasian nuthatch is primarily a lowland bird in the north of its range, but reaches the tree-line in Switzerland, at or higher, and breeds occasionally at in Austria. It breeds at similar levels in the mountains of Turkey, the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a> and <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a>. It is mainly a mountain bird in southern Japan, , and Taiwan, , but in southern China, the chestnut-vented nuthatch is the highland species, with the Eurasian species at lower levels.

Nuthatches are <a href="monogamy">monogamous</a>, and a pair occupies a breeding territory in which it spends the winter as well. Territory sizes range from in Europe to an average of in the sub-optimal conifer forests of Siberia. The male sings to defend his territory and attract a mate. Both sexes have a <a href="courtship%20display">courtship display</a> with a floating, quivering flight, and the male will also make circular flights with a spread tail and raised head. He will also feed the female while courting her. Despite the <a href="Pair%20bond">lifelong pairing</a>, genetic research in Germany showed that at least 10% of the young in the study area were fathered by another male, usually from an adjacent territory.

The nest is in a tree cavity, usually an old <a href="woodpecker">woodpecker</a> hole, but sometimes of natural origin. Occasionally the female will enlarge an existing hole in rotten wood. The nest site is typically above the ground and has a deep base of pine bark or chips of other wood, rarely supplemented with dry plant material. If the entrance to the hole is too large, it is plastered with mud, clay and sometimes dung to make it smaller. A small entrance and large interior, together with the use of a deep layer of wood chips in which to bury the eggs and small young when the adults leave the nest, may be adaptations to reduce the chance of predation. Nests with small entrance holes are most successful. Locally, a small entrance may make it less likely that the nest will be taken over by <a href="common%20starling">common starling</a>s. The female undertakes most of the work, and often plasters the inside of the cavity too, taking up to four weeks to complete the construction. A nest is often re-used in subsequent years.

The <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> is usually 6–9 red-speckled white eggs, although up to 13 eggs are sometimes laid. They average and weigh of which 6% is shell. The female incubates the eggs for 13–18 days to hatching, and broods the <a href="altricial">altricial</a> downy chicks until they <a href="fledge">fledge</a> 20–26 days later. Both adults feed the chicks in the nest and continue after they fledge until they become independent in about 8–14 days. Normally only one brood is raised each year. When nest boxes are used, the clutch size and number of fledglings are greater in larger boxes. For reasons that are unclear, there is no link between cavity size and nesting outcomes for natural holes.

The sedentary nature of this species means that juveniles can only acquire a territory by finding a vacant area or replacing a dead adult. In Europe, young birds almost always move to unoccupied habitat, but in the larger territories of Siberia most live within the breeding range of an adult pair.

The adult annual survival rate across most of the range is around 51%, and a small Belgian study found a 25% local survival rate for juveniles. The typical lifespan is two years and the maximum known age for a wild bird is 12 years 11 months in the UK. There is also a Swiss longevity record of 10 years 6 months.

The Eurasian nuthatch eats mainly insects, particularly <a href="caterpillar">caterpillar</a> and <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s. In autumn and winter, the diet is supplemented with nuts and seeds, <a href="hazel">hazel</a> nuts and <a href="beech">beech</a> mast being preferred. The young are fed mainly on the insects favoured by their parents, with some seeds. Food items are found mainly on tree trunks and large branches, but smaller branches may also be investigated, and food may be taken from the ground, especially outside the breeding season. Nuthatches can forage when descending trees head first, as well as when climbing. Some prey is caught in flight, and a nuthatch will remove bark or rotten wood to reach insects, although it cannot chisel into healthy wood like a woodpecker. A pair may temporarily join a <a href="mixed-species%20foraging%20flock">mixed-species foraging flock</a> as it passes near their territory. The Eurasian nuthatch readily visits bird tables and bird feeders in winter, eating human-made food items such as fat, cheese, butter and bread. It has even been recorded as taking slaughterhouse offal. Sizeable hard food items like nuts or large insects are wedged into crevices in tree bark and smashed with the strong bill.

Plant food is stored year-round, but mainly in autumn. Individual seeds are hidden in cracks in bark, occasionally in walls or in the ground. The food item is usually concealed with lichen, moss or small pieces of bark. The cached food is retrieved in cold weather. Siberian birds store the seeds of the Siberian stone pine, sometimes hoarding enough to last a whole year. Cached food may sometimes include non-plant material such as pieces of bread, caterpillars and grubs, the <a href="larva">larva</a>e being incapacitated by battering. Hoarding is a long-term strategy, stored food items only being consumed when fresh food is hard to find, sometimes up to three months after caching. Birds with good stored food supplies are fitter that those with more limited resources. Beech mast crops vary widely from year to year. Where beech mast is an important part of the diet, adult survival rates are largely unaffected in years with a poor mast crop, but the number of juvenile birds falls in the autumn as they are lost through starvation or emigration. In areas where <a href="Corylus%20avellana">common hazel</a> is the prevalent tree species, there is a similar pattern of adult survival and loss of juvenile birds in years with poor nut production.

Across most of its European range, the most important predator of the Eurasian nuthatch is the <a href="Eurasian%20sparrowhawk">sparrowhawk</a>. Other species known to prey on this nuthatch include the <a href="northern%20goshawk">northern goshawk</a>, <a href="Hobby%20%28bird%29">hobby</a>, <a href="tawny%20owl">tawny owl</a>, <a href="Eurasian%20pygmy%20owl">pygmy owl</a> and <a href="least%20weasel">least weasel</a>. A Swedish study showed that 6.2% of the nuthatch nests in their study area were raided by predators. The perpetrators were not identified, but the main single predator of <a href="tit%20%28bird%29">tit</a> nests in the same study was the <a href="great%20spotted%20woodpecker">great spotted woodpecker</a>.

<a href="Common%20starling">Common starling</a>s will take over Eurasian nuthatch nest holes, reducing their breeding success. This is most likely to occur if the nest is high in a tree and there is a good local breeding density of the nuthatch. Introduced <a href="ring-necked%20parakeet">ring-necked parakeet</a>s may also compete with Eurasian nuthatches for nesting holes. The parakeets tend to occur in fragmented urban woodlands, while nuthatches prefer large old oak woodlands, which reduces the level of competition. Ornithologists conducting a 2010 Belgian study suggested that the problem was not so severe as to warrant culling of the parakeets.

<a href="Mite">Mite</a>s of the genus "<a href="Rhinonyssidae">Ptilonyssus</a>", such as "<a href="Ptilonyssus%20sittae">P. sittae</a>", have been found in the Eurasian nuthatch's <a href="nasal%20cavity">nasal cavities</a>. Intestinal worms include the <a href="nematode">nematode</a>s "<a href="Tridentocapillaria%20parusi">Tridentocapillaria parusi</a>" and "<a href="Pterothominx%20longifilla">Pterothominx longifilla</a>". Small studies in Slovakia and Spain found no blood parasites, but a larger Spanish survey found some evidence of "<a href="Plasmodium">Plasmodium</a>" infection.

The European population of the Eurasian nuthatch has been estimated as 22.5–57 million birds, suggesting a global total of 45.9–228 million individuals. China, Taiwan, Korea, Japan and Russia each have between 10,000 and 100,000 breeding pairs. The known breeding area is about 23.3 million km (9 million sq mi), which is a large proportion of the potential suitable habitat, and the population appears to be stable. The large numbers and huge breeding range mean that this species is classified by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> as being of <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a>.

The Eurasian nuthatch is common throughout much of its range, although densities are lower in the far north and in coniferous forests. Annual numbers in Siberia fluctuate depending on the availability of pine cones from year to year. In recent decades, the nuthatch has colonised Scotland and the Netherlands, and expanded its range in Wales, northern England, Norway and the <a href="High%20Atlas">High Atlas</a> mountain range in North Africa. "S. e. asiatica" breeds intermittently in Finland and northern Sweden following <a href="irruption">irruption</a>s. Because large trees are essential, felling or fragmentation of old woodland can lead to local declines or losses.

Ian Smith

Ian Douglas Smith (8 April 1919 – 20 November 2007) was a politician, farmer, and fighter pilot who served as <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Rhodesia">Prime Minister</a> of <a href="Rhodesia">Rhodesia</a> (or <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia">Southern Rhodesia</a>; today <a href="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>) from 1964 to 1979. As the country's first premier that was not born abroad, he led the predominantly white government that <a href="Rhodesia%27s%20Unilateral%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">unilaterally declared independence</a> from the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> in 1965, following prolonged dispute over the terms. He remained Prime Minister for almost all of the fourteen years of international isolation that followed, and oversaw Rhodesia's <a href="Rhodesian%20Security%20Forces">security forces</a> during most of the <a href="Rhodesian%20Bush%20War">Bush War</a>, which pitted the <a href="list%20of%20historical%20unrecognized%20states">unrecognised</a> administration against communist-backed black nationalist guerrilla groups. Smith, who has been described as personifying white Rhodesia, remains a highly controversial figure—supporters venerate him as a man of integrity and vision "who understood the uncomfortable truths of Africa", while critics describe an unrepentant racist whose policies and actions caused the deaths of thousands and contributed to Zimbabwe's later crises.

Smith was born to British immigrants in <a href="Selukwe">Selukwe</a>, a small town in the Southern Rhodesian <a href="Midlands%20Province">Midlands</a>, four years before the colony became <a href="responsible%20government">self-governing</a> in 1923. During the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, he <a href="Military%20service%20of%20Ian%20Smith">served as</a> a <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> fighter pilot. A crash in Egypt caused debilitating facial and bodily wounds that remained conspicuous for the rest of his life; following rehabilitation, he served in Europe, where he was shot down and fought with Italian partisans. He set up a farm in his home town in 1948 and, the same year, <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia%20general%20election%2C%201948">became Member of Parliament</a> for Selukweat 29 years old, the country's youngest ever MP. Originally a <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia%20Liberal%20Party">Liberal</a>, he defected to the <a href="United%20Federal%20Party">United Federal Party</a> in 1953, and served as <a href="Chief%20Whip">Chief Whip</a> from 1958 onwards. He left that party in 1961 in protest at the territory's new constitution, and in the following year helped <a href="Winston%20Field">Winston Field</a> to form the all-white, firmly conservative <a href="Rhodesian%20Front">Rhodesian Front</a> (RF), which called for independence without an immediate shift to majority rule.

Smith became Deputy Prime Minister following the Rhodesian Front's December 1962 <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201962">election victory</a>, and stepped up to the premiership after Field resigned in April 1964. With the UK government refusing to grant independence while Rhodesia did not devise a set timetable for the introduction of majority rule, talks with the UK Prime Minister <a href="Harold%20Wilson">Harold Wilson</a> repeatedly broke down, leading Smith and his <a href="Cabinet%20of%20Rhodesia">Cabinet</a> to declare independence on 11 November 1965. His government endured in the face of <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> economic sanctions with the assistance of South Africa and, <a href="Carnation%20Revolution">until 1974</a>, Portugal. Talks with the UK in 1966, 1968 and 1971 came to nothing. Smith declared Rhodesia a republic in 1970 and led the RF to three more decisive election victories over the next seven years. After the Bush War began in earnest in 1972, he negotiated with the non-militant nationalist leader Bishop <a href="Abel%20Muzorewa">Abel Muzorewa</a> and the rival guerrilla movements headed by <a href="Joshua%20Nkomo">Joshua Nkomo</a> and <a href="Robert%20Mugabe">Robert Mugabe</a>.

In 1978, Smith and non-militant nationalists including Muzorewa signed the <a href="Internal%20Settlement">Internal Settlement</a>, under which the country became <a href="Zimbabwe%20Rhodesia">Zimbabwe Rhodesia</a> in 1979. Mugabe and Nkomo continued fighting; no country recognised the settlement. Smith was part of Muzorewa's delegation that settled with the UK and the revolutionary guerrillas at <a href="Lancaster%20House%20Agreement">Lancaster House</a>, and, following Zimbabwe's recognised independence in 1980, he was <a href="Leader%20of%20the%20Opposition">Leader of the Opposition</a> during Mugabe's first seven years in power. Smith was a stridently vocal critic of the Mugabe government both before and after his retirement from frontline politics in 1987; he dedicated much of his 1997 memoirs, "", to condemning Mugabe and several UK politicians. As Mugabe's reputation thereafter plummeted amid Zimbabwe's economic ruin, reckoning of Smith and his legacy improved. Zimbabwean opposition supporters lauded the elderly Smith as an immovable symbol of resistance. He remained in Zimbabwe until 2005, when he moved to <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>, South Africa, for medical reasons. After his death two years later, at the age of 88, his ashes were repatriated and scattered at his farm.

Ian Douglas Smith was born on 8 April 1919 in <a href="Selukwe">Selukwe</a>, a small mining and farming town about southwest of the <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia">Southern Rhodesia</a>n capital <a href="Harare">Salisbury</a>. He had two elder sisters, Phyllis and Joan. His father, John Douglas "Jock" Smith, originally came from <a href="Hamilton%2C%20South%20Lanarkshire">Hamilton</a>, Scotland; the son of a cattle breeder and <a href="butcher">butcher</a>, he had emigrated to Rhodesia as an eighteen-year-old in 1898, and become a prominent rancher, butcher, miner and garage owner in Selukwe. Jock and his English wife, Agnes ("née" Hodgson), had met in 1907, when she was sixteen, a year after her family's emigration to Selukwe from <a href="Frizington">Frizington</a>, <a href="Cumberland">Cumberland</a>. After Mr Hodgson sent his wife and children back to England in 1908, Jock Smith astonished them in 1911 by arriving unannounced in Cumberland to ask for Agnes' hand; they had not seen each other for three years. They married in Frizington and returned together to Rhodesia, where Jock, an accomplished horseman, won the 1911 Coronation Derby at Salisbury.

The Smiths involved themselves heavily in local affairs. Jock chaired the village management board and commanded the Selukwe Company of the <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia%20Volunteers">Southern Rhodesia Volunteers</a>; he also became a founding member of the Selukwe <a href="Freemasons">Freemasons</a>' Lodge and president of the town's football and rugby clubs. Agnes, who became informally known as "Mrs Jock", established and ran the Selukwe <a href="Women%27s%20Institute">Women's Institute</a>. Both were appointed <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">MBE</a> (at different times) for their services to the community. "My parents strove to instil principles and moral virtues, the sense of right and wrong, of integrity, in their children," Ian Smith wrote in his memoirs. "They set wonderful examples to live up to." He considered his father "a man of extremely strong principles"—"one of the fairest men I have ever met and that is the way he brought me up. He always told me that we're entitled to our half of the country and the blacks are entitled to theirs." Raised on the frontier of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> in the UK's youngest <a href="settler%20colonialism">settler colony</a>, Smith and his generation of <a href="white%20people%20in%20Zimbabwe">white Rhodesians</a> grew up with a reputation for being "more British than the British", something in which they took great pride.

Ian Smith showed sporting promise from an early age. After attending the Selukwe primary school, he boarded at <a href="Chaplin%20High%20School">Chaplin School</a> in <a href="Gweru">Gwelo</a>, about away. In his final year at Chaplin, he was head <a href="prefect">prefect</a> captain of the school teams in cricket, rugby and tennis, recipient of the <a href="Victor%20Ludorum">Victor Ludorum</a> in athletics, and the school's outstanding rifle marksman. "I was an absolute lunatic about sport," he later said; "I concede, looking back, that I should have devoted much more time to my school work and less to sport." All the same, his grades were good enough to win a place at <a href="Rhodes%20University%20College">Rhodes University College</a>, in <a href="Grahamstown">Grahamstown</a> in South Africa, then often attended by Rhodesian students—partly because Rhodesia then had no university of its own, and partly because of the common eponymous association with <a href="Cecil%20Rhodes">Cecil Rhodes</a>. Smith enrolled at the start of 1938, reading for a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Commerce">Bachelor of Commerce</a> degree. After injuring his knee playing rugby, he took up rowing and became <a href="Boat%20positions%20%28sport%20rowing%29">stroke</a> for the university crew.

When the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> broke out in 1939, Southern Rhodesia had had <a href="self-governing%20colony">self-government</a> for 16 years, having gained <a href="responsible%20government">responsible government</a> from the UK in 1923. It was unique in the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> and <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> in that it held extensive autonomous powers (including defence, but not foreign affairs) while lacking <a href="dominion">dominion</a> status. As a British colony, Southern Rhodesia <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia%20in%20World%20War%20II">entered the conflict</a> automatically when Britain declared war on 3 September 1939, but its government issued a symbolic declaration of war anyway. Smith, who was about halfway through his university course, later described feeling patriotically compelled to put his studies aside to "fight for Britain and all that it represented". Excited by the idea of flying a <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Spitfire</a>, he wanted to join the air force, but was prevented from immediately doing so by a policy adopted in Rhodesia not to recruit university students until after they graduated. Smith engineered his recruitment into the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) in spite of this rule during 1940, suppressing mention of his studies, and formally joined in September 1941.

After a year's training at Gwelo under the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Air%20Training%20Plan">Empire Air Training Scheme</a>, Smith passed out with the rank of <a href="pilot%20officer">pilot officer</a> in September 1942. He hoped to be stationed in Britain, but was posted to the <a href="Mediterranean%20and%20Middle%20East%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">Middle East</a> instead; there he joined <a href="No.%20237%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF</a>, flying <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hurricanes</a>. In October 1943, in Egypt, Smith crashed his Hurricane after his throttle malfunctioned during a dawn takeoff. Suffering serious facial disfigurements, he also broke his jaw, leg and shoulder. Doctors and surgeons in <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a> rebuilt Smith's face through <a href="skin%20grafting">skin grafts</a> and <a href="plastic%20surgery">plastic surgery</a>, and he was passed fit to fly again in March 1944. Turning down an offer to return to Rhodesia as an instructor, he rejoined No. 237 Squadron, which had switched to flying Spitfire Mk IXs, in <a href="Corsica">Corsica</a> in May 1944.

During a <a href="strafing">strafing</a> raid over northern Italy on 22 June 1944, enemy flak hit Smith's craft and he had to bail out behind German lines. A peasant family named Zunino hid him for a brief time; he then joined a group of pro-Allied <a href="Italian%20resistance%20movement">Italian partisans</a> with whom he took part in sabotage operations against the German garrison for about three months. When the Germans pulled out of the area in October 1944, Smith left to try to link up with the Allied forces who had just <a href="Operation%20Dragoon">invaded</a> southern France. Accompanied by three other servicemen, each from a different European country, and a local guide, Smith hiked across the <a href="Maritime%20Alps">Maritime Alps</a>, finishing the journey walking barefoot on the ice and snow. American troops recovered him in November 1944. Smith again turned down the offer of a billet in Rhodesia and returned to active service in April 1945 with <a href="No.%20130%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 130 (Punjab) Squadron</a>, by then based in western Germany. He flew combat missions there, "[having] a little bit of fun shooting up odd things", he recalled, until the <a href="End%20of%20World%20War%20II%20in%20Europe">war in Europe ended</a> on 7 May 1945 with <a href="German%20Instrument%20of%20Surrender">Germany's surrender</a>. Smith remained with No. 130 Squadron for the rest of his service, flying with the unit to Denmark and Norway, and was discharged at the end of 1945 with the rank of <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a>. He retained reasonable proficiency in <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a> for the rest of his life, albeit reportedly with an "atrocious" accent.

With Jock in increasingly poor health after the war, the Smith family briefly considered sending Ian to start a life in the United States with the help of Jock's brother Elijah, who had become a prosperous New York businessman. Smith showed little interest in leaving Rhodesia, however, and decided that he would finish at university, then come home and buy his own farm. He returned to Rhodes University in early 1946 to find the campus swamped with veterans like himself—there were 400 of them out of barely 1,000 students. Smith became spokesman for the university's ex-servicemen, senior student of his hall and chairman of the students' representative council. He turned down the presidency of the rowing club, saying it would be one administrative commitment too many, but agreed to coach the crew. Training the rowers under strict military-style discipline, he led them to victory at the 1946 South African Inter-Varsity Boat Race at the <a href="Vaal%20Dam">Vaal Dam</a> south of <a href="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>, upstaging the well-fancied <a href="University%20of%20the%20Witwatersrand">Wits</a> crew, and subsequently received national-standard varsity <a href="sporting%20colours">honours</a> for rowing, the first Rhodes student ever to do so. At the end of the year, having passed the exams to gain his commerce degree ("by some miracle", he recalled), he returned to Southern Rhodesia to study farming at <a href="Gwebi%20College%20of%20Agriculture">Gwebi Agricultural College</a>, near Salisbury.

Smith attended dedicated courses for ex-servicemen at Gwebi during 1947 and 1948, learning skills such as ploughing, herding and milking; he gained practical experience at Taylor's dairy farm near Selukwe and on a tobacco ranch at <a href="Marondera">Marandellas</a>. In 1947, he met <a href="Janet%20Smith%20%28Rhodesia%29">Janet Duvenage</a> ("née" Watt), a schoolteacher from the <a href="Cape%20Province">Cape</a> in South Africa who had come to Selukwe to stay with family after the death of her husband <a href="Piet%20Duvenage">Piet</a> on the rugby field. What Janet had planned as a short holiday for herself and her two infant children, Jean and Robert, turned into a permanent move when she accepted a job offer from the Selukwe junior school. Smith later wrote that the qualities that had attracted him most to Janet were her intelligence, courage and "oppos[ition] on principle to side-stepping or evading an issue ... her tendency was to opt for a decision requiring courage, as opposed to taking the easy way out". They became engaged in 1948. Meanwhile, Smith negotiated the purchase of a piece of rough land near Selukwe, bounded by the <a href="Runde%20River">Lundi</a> and Impali Rivers and bisected by a clear stream. He and Janet gave the previously nameless plot the name that the local <a href="Shona%20people">Karanga people</a> used to refer to the stream, "Gwenoro", and set up a ranch where they ran cattle and grew tobacco and maize.

A <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201948">general election</a> was called in Southern Rhodesia in July 1948 after the <a href="United%20Federal%20Party">United Party</a> government, headed by the Prime Minister <a href="Godfrey%20Huggins%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Malvern">Sir Godfrey Huggins</a>, unexpectedly lost a vote in the <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20Legislative%20Assembly">Legislative Assembly</a>. In August, about a month before election day, Smith was approached by members of the opposition <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia%20Liberal%20Party">Liberal Party</a> who asked him to stand for them in Selukwe. <a href="Jacob%20Smit">Jacob Smit</a>'s Liberals, despite their name, were decidedly illiberal, chiefly representing commercial farming, mining and industrial interests. Smith was initially reluctant, saying he was too busy organising his life to stand, but agreed after one of the Liberal officials suggested that a political career might allow him to defend the values he had fought for in the Second World War. With their wedding barely a fortnight away, Janet was astonished to learn of Smith's decision to run for parliament, having never before heard him discuss politics. "I can't say that I am really interested in party politics," Smith explained to her, "but I've always been most interested in sound government." Smith duly became a Liberal Party politician, finalised his purchase of Gwenoro, and married Janet, adopting her two children as his own, all in a few weeks in August 1948. They enjoyed a few days' honeymoon at <a href="Victoria%20Falls%2C%20Zimbabwe">Victoria Falls</a>, then went straight into the election campaign.

The Southern Rhodesian electoral system allowed only those who met certain financial and educational qualifications to vote. The criteria were applied equally to all regardless of race, but since most black citizens did not meet the set standards, the electoral roll and the colonial parliament were overwhelmingly white. Smith canvassed around the geographically very large Selukwe constituency and quickly won considerable popularity. Many white families were receptive to him because of their respect for his father, or because they had had children at school with him. His RAF service also helped, particularly as the local United Party candidate, Petrus Cilliers, had been interned during the hostilities for opposing the war effort. On 15 September 1948, Smith defeated Cilliers and the <a href="Rhodesia%20Labour%20Party">Labour</a> candidate Egon Klifborg with 361 votes out of 747, and thereby became Member of Parliament for Selukwe. At 29 years old, he was the youngest MP in Southern Rhodesian history. The Liberals, however, were roundly defeated, going from 12 seats before the election to only five afterwards. Jacob Smit, who had lost his seat in Salisbury City, retired and was replaced as <a href="Leader%20of%20the%20Opposition">Leader of the Opposition</a> by <a href="Raymond%20Stockil">Raymond Stockil</a>, who renamed the Liberals the Rhodesia Party. Having grown up in an area of <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a> so pro-<a href="Jan%20Smuts">Smuts</a> that she had never had to vote, Janet did not think her husband's entry to parliament would alter their lives at all. "First of all I was marrying a farmer," she later said, "now he was going to be a politician as well. So I said, 'Well, if you are really interested in it, carry on.'... It never dawned on me—being so naive about politicians—that our lives would be affected in the slightest degree."

Because of Southern Rhodesia's small size and lack of major controversies, its <a href="unicameralism">unicameral</a> parliament then sat only twice a year, for about three months in total, holding discussions in the afternoons either side of a half-hour break for tea on the lawn. Smith's early parliamentary commitments in Salisbury therefore did not detract greatly from his ranching. His maiden speech to the Legislative Assembly, in November 1948, concerned the Union of South Africa Trade Agreement Bill, then at its second <a href="reading%20%28legislature%29">reading</a>. He was slow to make an impact in parliament—most of his early contributions related to farming and mining—but his exertions within the party won him Stockil's respect and confidence. Janet ran Gwenoro during Smith's absences, and gave birth to his only biological child, <a href="Alec%20Smith">Alec</a>, in Gwelo on 20 May 1949. Smith also served as a <a href="Presbyterianism">Presbyterian</a> <a href="Presbyterian%20polity%23Elder">elder</a>.

The pursuit of full dominion status was then regarded as something of a non-issue by most Southern Rhodesian politicians. They viewed themselves as virtually independent already; they lacked only the foreign affairs portfolio and taking this on would mean having to shoulder the expense for high commissions and embassies overseas. Huggins and the United Party instead pursued an initially semi-independent Federation with <a href="Northern%20Rhodesia">Northern Rhodesia</a> and <a href="Nyasaland">Nyasaland</a>, two protectorates directly administered from London, with the hope of ultimately creating a single, united dominion in south-central Africa.

Smith was one of the few to raise the independence issue at this time, according to his memoirs because his "instinct and training told me to be prepared for every contingency". During the Federation debate in the House of Assembly, he posited that since Southern Rhodesia was effectively choosing Federation over independence, a clause should be inserted into the bill guaranteeing Southern Rhodesia dominion status in the event of a Federal break-up. The United Party rejected this on the grounds that the Federation had to be declared indissoluble so it could raise loans. Smith was uncertain about the Federal project, but publicly supported it after the mostly white electorate approved it in a <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20federation%20referendum%2C%201953">referendum</a> in April 1953. He told the "<a href="The%20Herald%20%28Zimbabwe%29">Rhodesia Herald</a>" that now it had been decided to pursue Federation, it was in Southern Rhodesia's best interests for everybody to try to make it succeed. He and other Rhodesia Party politicians joined the new <a href="Federal%20Party%20%28Rhodesia%20and%20Nyasaland%29">Federal Party</a>, headed by Huggins and Northern Rhodesia's <a href="Roy%20Welensky">Sir Roy Welensky</a>, on 29 April 1953.

The <a href="Federation%20of%20Rhodesia%20and%20Nyasaland">Federation</a> was overtly led by Southern Rhodesia, the most developed of the three territories—Salisbury was its capital and Huggins its first Prime Minister. <a href="Garfield%20Todd">Garfield Todd</a> replaced Huggins as Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia. Resigning his Selukwe seat, Smith contested and won the Federal Assembly's <a href="Midlands%20Province">Midlands</a> constituency in the inaugural <a href="Federation%20of%20Rhodesia%20and%20Nyasaland%20election%2C%201953">Federal election</a> on 15 December 1953, and thereafter continued as a <a href="backbench">backbench</a> member of little distinction. In the recollection of Welensky, who took over as Federal Prime Minister on Huggins's retirement in 1956, Smith "didn't spend much time in Salisbury" during the early Federal period, and had "three major interests ... one was daylight saving, one was European education and he always showed an interest in farming".

Smith received his first political office in November 1958, following that month's Federal election (in which he was returned as MP for <a href="Gwanda">Gwanda</a>), after one of Welensky's Federal Cabinet ministers requested Smith's appointment as a <a href="Parliamentary%20Secretary">Parliamentary Secretary</a> in the new <a href="United%20Federal%20Party">United Federal Party</a> (UFP) government. Welensky turned this down, saying that while he appreciated Smith's relative seniority on the back benches after 10 years in parliament, he did not think he had "shown the particular drive that I would have expected" for such a role. He decided to instead give Smith "a run as <a href="Chief%20Whip">Chief Whip</a>, which is generally the step to a ministerial appointment, and ... see how he works out".

According to his biographer Phillippa Berlyn, Smith remained a somewhat pedestrian figure as Chief Whip, though he was acknowledged by his peers as someone who "did his homework well" whenever he contributed. <a href="Clifford%20Dupont">Clifford Dupont</a>, then Smith's counterpart as Chief Whip of the <a href="Dominion%20Party">Dominion Party</a>, later commented that the UFP's huge majority in the Federal Assembly gave Smith little opportunity to distinguish himself as few votes were ever in serious doubt.

Amid <a href="decolonization%20of%20Africa">decolonisation</a> and the <a href="Wind%20of%20Change%20%28speech%29">Wind of Change</a>, the idea of "<a href="no%20independence%20before%20majority%20rule">no independence before majority rule</a>" ("NIBMAR") gained considerable ground in British political circles during the late 1950s and early 1960s. The Federation, which had faced black opposition from the start, particularly in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, grew ever more tenuous. Despite Todd's lowering of Southern Rhodesia's educational and financial voting qualifications in 1957 to enlarge the black electorate, very few of the newly enfranchised blacks registered to vote, partly because the black nationalist movement targeted those who did with arson attacks and <a href="Molotov%20cocktail">petrol bombings</a>. Attempting to advance the case for Southern Rhodesian independence, particularly in the event of Federal dissolution, <a href="Edgar%20Whitehead">Sir Edgar Whitehead</a>, who replaced Todd in 1958, agreed to a new constitution with Britain in 1961. The 1961 constitution contained no explicit independence guarantees, but Whitehead, Welensky and other proponents nevertheless presented it to the Southern Rhodesian electorate as the "independence constitution" under which Southern Rhodesia would become a <a href="Commonwealth%20realm">Commonwealth realm</a> on a par with Australia, Canada and New Zealand if the Federation broke up.

Smith was one of the loudest voices of white dissent against the new constitution. He opposed its splitting of the heretofore non-racial, qualified electorate into graduated "A" and "B" rolls, saying the proposed system had "racialist" connotations, and objected to the idea that the first black MPs would be elected on what he said would be a "debased franchise". "Our policy in the past has always been that we would have a government, in Rhodesia, based on merit and that people wouldn't worry whether you were black or whether you were white," he said. He also pointed out that the document did not actually guarantee Southern Rhodesian independence in the event of Federal dissolution. At the UFP vote on the constitution on 22 February 1961, Smith was the only member out of 280 to vote against it. Deeply disillusioned by these developments, he resigned from the UFP soon after to sit in the Federal Assembly as an <a href="Independent%20%28politician%29">independent</a>. He lent his support to the "United Group", an awkward coalition wherein <a href="Winston%20Field">Winston Field</a>'s conservative Dominion Party closed ranks with <a href="Robert%20Clarkson%20Tredgold">Sir Robert Tredgold</a> and other liberals against the constitutional proposals, despite opposing them for totally contradictory reasons. The black nationalist leaders initially endorsed the constitution, signing the draft document, but almost immediately repudiated it and called for blacks to boycott elections held under it. A <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20constitution%20referendum%2C%201961">referendum</a> of the mostly white electorate approved the new constitution by a majority of 65% on 26 July 1961.

As the UK government granted majority rule in Nyasaland and made moves towards the same in Northern Rhodesia, Smith decided that the Federation was a lost cause and resolved to found a new party that would push for Southern Rhodesian independence without an immediate transfer of power. With the support of the millionaire rancher, miner and industrialist <a href="Boss%20Lilford">D C "Boss" Lilford</a>, he formed the Rhodesian Reform Party (RRP), based around defectors from the UFP, in December 1961. Meanwhile, Whitehead attempted to counter the black nationalists and persuade newly eligible blacks to register as voters. He banned the main nationalist group, the National Democratic Party, for being violent and intimidatory—it reformed overnight as the <a href="Zimbabwe%20African%20People%27s%20Union">Zimbabwe African People's Union</a> (ZAPU)—and announced that the UFP would repeal the Land Apportionment Act, which segregated the ownership and occupation of certain areas on a racial basis, if it won the next Southern Rhodesian election. Commitments such as these won the UFP few black votes and prompted many scandalised whites to defect to the RRP or Field's Dominion Party.

Smith, Field and others met in Salisbury on 13 March 1962 and agreed to unite against Whitehead as the <a href="Rhodesian%20Front">Rhodesian Front</a> (RF). The Front ranged from former UFP men, including Smith, who advocated gradual transition and a government based on merit and electoral qualifications, to the Dominion Party's more right-wing members, some of whom held segregationist views not dissimilar to those of South Africa's <a href="National%20Party%20%28South%20Africa%29">National Party</a>. Amid these differences, the nascent RF coalition was shaky at best. Its members were brought together by their common opposition to Whitehead's promises of fast-track reform, which they agreed would lead to a <a href="Congo%20Crisis">Congo</a>-style national crisis, the flight of the white community and ultimately the country's destruction. In the wider <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> context, the ardently anti-communist RF aspired to represent a pro-<a href="Western%20Bloc">Western</a> bulwark in Africa, alongside South Africa and Portugal, in the face of what they saw as Soviet and Chinese expansionism. Smith asserted that the RF worked to thwart "this mad idea of a hand-over, of a sell-out of the European and his civilisation, indeed of everything he had put into his country". "The white man is the master of Rhodesia," he said; "[he] has built it and intends to keep it".

The RF ignored the April 1962 Federal elections, deeming them irrelevant, and instead concentrated on the Southern Rhodesian elections that were due at the end of the year. Whitehead attempted to curb the continuing black nationalist violence through new legislation and in September 1962 banned ZAPU, arresting 1,094 of its members and describing it as a "terrorist organisation", but he was still seen by much of the electorate as too liberal. He set a <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201962">general election</a> for 14 December 1962. A number of corporations that had previously funded UFP campaigning this time backed the RF. The RF campaign exploited the chaos in the Congo and the uncertainty regarding Southern Rhodesia's future to create a theme of urgency—it pledged to keep power "in responsible hands", to defend the Land Apportionment Act, to oppose compulsory integration, and to win Southern Rhodesian independence.

The electoral race was close-run until the night before election day, when Whitehead made what proved a fatal political gaffe by telling a public meeting at Marandellas that he would appoint a black Cabinet minister immediately if he won the election, and might soon have as many as six. This statement appeared on the radio news just before the polling booths opened the next morning, and stunned white voters. Many abandoned Whitehead at the last minute. The results, announced on 15 December 1962, put the RF into government with 35 "A"-roll seats to the UFP's 15 "A"-roll and 14 "B"-roll seats. Few had expected this; even the RF was somewhat taken aback by its victory, though Smith later described feeling "quietly confident" on election day. Contesting the Umzingwane constituency in the rural south-west, he bested the UFP's Reginald Segar by 803 votes to 546.

Announcing his Cabinet on 17 December 1962, Field named Smith his Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Treasury. Two days later, <a href="Rab%20Butler">R A Butler</a>, the British Deputy Prime Minister and <a href="First%20Secretary%20of%20State">First Secretary of State</a>, announced that the UK government would allow Nyasaland to leave the Federation. With Northern Rhodesia now also under a secessionist black nationalist government—<a href="Kenneth%20Kaunda">Kenneth Kaunda</a> and <a href="Harry%20Nkumbula">Harry Nkumbula</a> had formed a coalition to keep the UFP out—and Southern Rhodesia under the RF, the Federation was effectively over. The Field Cabinet made Southern Rhodesian independence on Federal dissolution its first priority, but the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> government in the UK was reluctant to grant this under the 1961 constitution as it knew doing so would lead to censure and loss of prestige in the United Nations (UN) and the Commonwealth. Indeed, Southern Rhodesia's minority government had already become something of an embarrassment to the UK and it hurt Britain's reputation to even maintain the "status quo" there. Granting independence without major constitutional reform would furthermore provoke outcry from the Conservatives' main parliamentary opposition, the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a>, which was strongly anti-colonial and supportive of black nationalist ambitions.
Butler announced on 6 March 1963 that he was going to convene a conference to decide the Federation's future. It would be impossible (or at least very difficult) for Britain to dissolve the union without Southern Rhodesia's co-operation as the latter, being self-governing, had been co-signatory to the Federal agreement in 1953. According to Smith, Field, Dupont and other RF politicians, Butler made several oral independence guarantees to ensure Southern Rhodesia's attendance and support at the conference, but repeatedly refused to give anything on paper. Field and Smith claimed that Butler justified this to them the day before the conference began by saying that binding <a href="Government%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Whitehall</a> to a document rather than his word would be against the Commonwealth's "spirit of trust"—an argument that Field eventually accepted. "Let's remember the trust you emphasised," Smith warned, according to Field's account wagging his finger at Butler; "if you break that you will live to regret it." No minutes were made of this meeting. Butler denied afterwards that he had ever made such a promise. Southern Rhodesia attended the conference, held at the <a href="Victoria%20Falls%20Hotel">Victoria Falls Hotel</a> over a week starting from 28 June 1963, and among other things it was agreed to formally liquidate the Federation at the end of 1963.

The Federation dissolved on 31 December 1963 with Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia both on track for full statehood by the end of 1964, while Southern Rhodesia continued to drift in uncertainty. Under huge pressure from the RF to rectify this matter and win independence, Field's perceived vacillation and timidness in his dealings with the UK government caused sections of his party to lose confidence in him during early 1964. On 2 April 1964, with Smith in the chair, the RF caucus passed a near-unanimous <a href="motion%20of%20no%20confidence">vote of no confidence</a> in Field, leading to the Prime Minister's resignation 11 days later. Smith accepted the Cabinet's nomination to take his place. He was the first Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister to have been born in the country, something that he thought profoundly altered the character of the dispute with Britain. "For the first time in its history the country now had a Rhodesian-born PM, someone whose roots were not in Britain, but in southern Africa," he later reflected—"in other words, a white African."

Most of the Southern Rhodesian press predicted that Smith would not last long; one column called him "a momentary man", thrust into the spotlight by the RF's dearth of proven leaders. His only real rival to replace Field had been <a href="William%20John%20Harper">William Harper</a>, an ardent segregationist who had headed the Dominion Party's Southern Rhodesian branch during the Federal years. Some reporters predicted Welensky's imminent introduction to Southern Rhodesian politics at the head of an RF–UFP <a href="coalition%20government">coalition government</a>, but Welensky showed little interest in this idea, saying he would be unable to manoeuvre in an RF-dominated House. The RF's replacement of Field with Smith drew criticism from the British Labour leader <a href="Harold%20Wilson">Harold Wilson</a>, who called it "brutal", while <a href="John%20Baines%20Johnston">J B Johnston</a>, the British High Commissioner in Salisbury, indicated his disapproval by refusing to meet Smith for two weeks after he took office. The ZAPU leader <a href="Joshua%20Nkomo">Joshua Nkomo</a> branded the new Smith Cabinet "a suicide squad ... interested not in the welfare of all the people but only in their own", and predicted that the RF would "eventually destroy themselves". Asserting that a lasting "place for the white man" in Southern Rhodesia would benefit all of the country's people, the new Prime Minister said the government should be based "on merit, not on colour or nationalism", and insisted that there would be "no African nationalist government here in my lifetime".

Smith announced his Cabinet on his first day in office, 14 April 1964. He increased the number of ministers from 10 to 11, redistributed portfolios, and made three new appointments. Smith's fellow former UFP men made up most of the new RF Cabinet, with Harper and the Minister of Agriculture, the <a href="James%20Graham%2C%207th%20Duke%20of%20Montrose">Duke of Montrose</a> (also called Lord Graham), heading a minority of hardline Dominion Party veterans. <a href="Ken%20Flower">Ken Flower</a>, whom Field had appointed Director of the <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Organisation">Central Intelligence Organisation</a> (CIO) on its creation the previous year, was surprised to be retained by Smith. Smith announced his policies to the nation through full-page advertisements in the newspapers: "No forced integration. No lowering of standards. No abdication of responsible government. No repeal of the Land Apportionment Act. No appeasement to suit the <a href="Bandung%20Conference">Afro-Asian bloc</a>." "An honest Rhodesian," a 1964 political poster declared—"Trust Mr Smith. He will never hand over Rhodesia."

One of the Smith government's first actions was to crack down hard on the black nationalist political violence that had erupted following the establishment of a second black nationalist organisation, the <a href="Zimbabwe%20African%20National%20Union">Zimbabwe African National Union</a> (ZANU), by disgruntled ZAPU members in Tanzania in August 1963. The rival movements were split tribally, ZAPU being mostly <a href="Northern%20Ndebele%20people">Ndebele</a> and ZANU predominantly <a href="Shona%20people">Shona</a>, and politically—ZAPU, which had relabelled itself the People's Caretaker Council (PCC) within Southern Rhodesia to circumvent its ban, was <a href="Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism">Marxist–Leninist</a> and backed by the <a href="Warsaw%20Pact">Warsaw Pact</a> and its allies, while ZANU had aligned itself with <a href="Maoism">Maoism</a> and the bloc headed by communist China. Their respective supporters in the black townships clashed constantly, also targeting non-aligned blacks whom they hoped to recruit, and sporadically attacked whites, businesses and police stations.

Amid PCC/ZAPU's calls for various strikes and protests, including an appeal for black children to boycott state schools, Smith's Justice Minister Clifford Dupont had Nkomo and other PCC/ZAPU leaders restricted at <a href="Gonakudzingwa%20Restriction%20Camp">Gonakudzingwa</a> in the remote south-east two days after Smith took office. The politically motivated killing of a white man, <a href="Death%20of%20Petrus%20Oberholzer">Petrus Oberholzer</a>, near <a href="Chimanimani">Melsetter</a> by ZANU insurgents on 4 July 1964 marked the start of intensified black nationalist violence and police counteraction that culminated in the banning of ZANU and PCC/ZAPU on 26 August, with most of the two movements' respective leaders concurrently jailed or restricted. ZANU, ZAPU and their respective guerrilla armies—the <a href="Zimbabwe%20African%20National%20Liberation%20Army">Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army</a> (ZANLA) and the <a href="Zimbabwe%20People%27s%20Revolutionary%20Army">Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army</a> (ZIPRA)—thereafter operated from abroad.

Smith, who had been to the UK only four times before 1964 and never more than briefly, was soon labelled a "raw colonial" by Whitehall. He was almost immediately at loggerheads with the UK government, which he claimed had forsaken British ideals, and the Commonwealth, which he said had abandoned its own founding principles amid the Wind of Change. He accused both of isolating Southern Rhodesia because it still respected these values. When he learned in June that Salisbury would not be represented at the <a href="Commonwealth%20Prime%20Ministers%27%20Conference">Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference</a> for the first time since <a href="British%20Empire%20Economic%20Conference">1932</a>, he was deeply insulted and alleged British betrayal, double standards and appeasement. Three months later, Smith accepted the British condition that the independence terms had to be acceptable to majority opinion, but impasse immediately developed regarding the mechanism by which black views would be gauged. Labour's narrow victory in the October 1964 UK <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201964">general election</a> meant that Smith would be negotiating not with <a href="Alec%20Douglas-Home">Sir Alec Douglas-Home</a> but with Harold Wilson, who was far less accommodating towards the RF stand. Smith declared acceptability to majority opinion to have been demonstrated after a largely white <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20independence%20referendum%2C%201964">referendum</a> and an "<a href="indaba">indaba</a>" of tribal chiefs and headmen both decisively backed independence under the 1961 constitution in October and November 1964, but black nationalists and the UK government dismissed the "indaba" as insufficiently representative of the black community.
Following Northern Rhodesia's independence as Zambia in October 1964—Nyasaland had been independent Malawi since July—Southern Rhodesia began referring to itself simply as Rhodesia, but Whitehall rejected this change. Perceiving Smith to be on the verge of a <a href="unilateral%20declaration%20of%20independence">unilateral declaration of independence</a> (UDI), Wilson issued a statement in October 1964 warning of dire economic and political consequences, and wrote to Smith demanding "a categorical assurance forthwith" that no UDI would be attempted. Smith ignored this, expressing confusion as to what he had done to provoke it. The UK and Rhodesian governments exchanged often confrontational correspondence over the next year or so, each accusing the other of being unreasonable and intransigent. Little progress was made when two Prime Ministers met in person in January 1965, when Smith travelled to London for <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Sir Winston Churchill</a>'s funeral. The RF called a fresh election for <a href="Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201965">May 1965</a> and, campaigning on an <a href="election%20promise">election promise</a> of independence, won all 50 "A"-roll seats (elected mostly by whites). Wilson's ministers deliberately stonewalled Smith during mid-1965, hoping to eventually break him down, but this only caused the Rhodesian hierarchy to feel yet more alienated. From June, a peripheral dispute concerned Rhodesia's unilateral and ultimately successful attempt to open an independent <a href="Rhodesian%20mission%20in%20Lisbon">mission in Lisbon</a>; Portugal's acceptance of this in September 1965 prompted British outrage and Rhodesian delight.

Amid rumours that UDI was imminent, Smith arrived in London on 4 October 1965 with the declared intent of settling the independence issue, but flew home eight days later with the matter unresolved. When Wilson travelled to Salisbury on 26 October, Smith offered to enfranchise about half a million black Rhodesians immediately along the lines of "one taxpayer, one vote" in return for independence, but Wilson said this was unacceptable as most blacks would still be excluded. He proposed a Royal Commission to test public opinion in Rhodesia regarding independence under the 1961 constitution, and suggested that the UK might safeguard black representation in the Rhodesian parliament by withdrawing relevant devolved powers. This latter prospect horrified Smith's team as it seemed to them to have ruled out the failsafe option of keeping the "status quo". After Wilson returned to Britain on 30 October 1965, he presented terms for the Royal Commission that the Rhodesians found unacceptable—among other things, Britain would not commit itself to accepting the results. Smith rejected these conditions on 5 November, saying they made the whole exercise pointless. After waiting a few days for new terms from Wilson, Smith made a <a href="Consensus%20decision-making">consensus decision</a> with his Cabinet to break ties unilaterally on 11 November 1965, and signed the <a href="Rhodesia%27s%20Unilateral%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Unilateral Declaration of Independence</a> at 11:00 <a href="Central%20Africa%20Time">local time</a>.

UDI, while received calmly by most Rhodesians, prompted political outrage in Britain and overseas. It astonished Wilson, who called on the people of Rhodesia to ignore the post-UDI government, which he described as "hell-bent on illegal self-destroying". Following orders from Whitehall and the passage of the <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia%20Act%201965">Southern Rhodesia Act 1965</a>, the colonial <a href="Governor%20of%20Southern%20Rhodesia">Governor</a> <a href="Humphrey%20Gibbs">Sir Humphrey Gibbs</a> formally sacked Smith and his Cabinet, accusing them of treason. Smith and his ministers ignored this, considering Gibbs's office obsolete under the 1965 constitution enacted as part of UDI. After Gibbs made clear that he would not resign, Smith's government effectively replaced him with Dupont, who was appointed to the post of "<a href="Officer%20Administering%20the%20Government">Officer Administering the Government</a>" (created by the 1965 constitution). No attempt was made to remove Gibbs from his official residence at Government House, however; he remained there, ignored by the Smith administration, until the declaration of a republic in 1970. 

Smith and his government initially continued to profess loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II. They sought to have Rhodesia reconstituted as a Commonwealth realm, with Elizabeth II as "Queen of Rhodesia". Indeed, the UDI document ended with the words "God Save The Queen". In December 1965, Smith, asserting the rights he claimed as Elizabeth II's Rhodesian prime minister, wrote a letter to the Queen asking her to appoint Dupont as <a href="Governor-General">Governor-General</a> of Rhodesia. The Queen rejected Smith's letter, which she characterised in her response as "purported advice". The UK, with the near-unanimous support of the international community, maintained that Gibbs was now Elizabeth II's only legitimate representative in what it still reckoned as the colony of Southern Rhodesia, and hence the sole lawful authority there. 

The <a href="United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly">UN General Assembly</a> and <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">Security Council</a> quickly joined Britain in condemning UDI as illegal and racist. Security Council <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%20216">Resolutions 216</a> and <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%20217">217</a>, adopted in the days following Smith's declaration, denounced UDI as an illegitimate "usurpation of power by a racist settler minority", and called on nations not to entertain diplomatic or economic relations. No country recognised Rhodesia as independent. Black nationalists in Rhodesia and their overseas backers, prominently the <a href="Organisation%20of%20African%20Unity">Organisation of African Unity</a> (OAU), clamoured for the UK to remove Smith's government with a military invasion, but Britain dismissed this option, citing logistical issues, the risk of provoking a pre-emptive Rhodesian strike on Zambia, and the psychological issues likely to accompany any confrontation between British and Rhodesian troops. Wilson instead resolved to end UDI through economic sanctions, banning the supply of oil to Rhodesia and the import of most Rhodesian goods to Britain. When Smith continued to receive oil through South Africa and <a href="Portuguese%20Mozambique">Portuguese Mozambique</a>, Wilson posted a <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> squadron to the <a href="Mozambique%20Channel">Mozambique Channel</a> in March 1966. This blockade, the <a href="Beira%20Patrol">Beira Patrol</a>, was endorsed by <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%20221">UN Security Council Resolution 221</a> the following month.

Wilson predicted in January 1966 that the various boycotts would force Smith to give in "within a matter of weeks rather than months", but the British (and later UN) sanctions had little effect on Rhodesia, largely because South Africa and Portugal went on trading with it, providing it with oil and other key resources. Clandestine trade with other nations also continued, initially at a reduced level, and the diminished presence of foreign competitors helped domestic industries to slowly mature and expand. Even many OAU states, while bombarding Rhodesia with opprobrium, continued importing Rhodesian food and other products. Rhodesia thus avoided the economic cataclysm predicted by Wilson and gradually became more self-sufficient. "Rhodesia can not only take it, but she can also make it," Smith said on 29 April 1966, while opening the annual Central African Trade Fair in <a href="Bulawayo">Bulawayo</a>. "When I say take it, I use it in two ways. Firstly, when it comes to sanctions we have proved we can take it. Secondly, when it comes to independence, we have also proved we can take it."

Wilson told the British <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> in January 1966 that he would not enter any kind of dialogue with Smith's post-UDI government (which he called "the illegal regime") until it gave up its claim of independence, but by mid-1966 British and Rhodesian civil servants were holding "talks about talks" in London and Salisbury. By November that year, Wilson had agreed to negotiate personally with Smith. Smith and Wilson subsequently held two rounds of direct negotiations, both of which were held aboard Royal Navy ships off <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>. The first took place aboard <a href="HMS%20Tiger%20%28C20%29">HMS "Tiger"</a> between 2 and 4 December 1966, while the second, aboard <a href="HMS%20Fearless%20%28L10%29">HMS "Fearless"</a>, was held between 8 and 13 October 1968.

The British Prime Minister went to HMS "Tiger" in a belligerent mindset. Wilson's political secretary <a href="Marcia%20Falkender%2C%20Baroness%20Falkender">Marcia Falkender</a> later wrote of "apartheid ... on that ship", with the British and Rhodesian delegations separated in all activities outside the conference room at Wilson's orders. Despite the uneasy atmosphere—accounts from both sides describe Wilson dealing with the Rhodesians extremely tersely—talks progressed relatively smoothly until the subject turned to the manner of the transition. Wilson insisted on the abandonment of the 1965 constitution, the dissolution of the post-UDI government in favour of a "broad-based" multiracial interim administration and a period under a British Governor, conditions that Smith saw as tantamount to surrender, particularly as the British proposed to draft and introduce the new constitution only after a fresh test of opinion under UK control. When Smith asserted on 3 December that he could not settle without first consulting his Cabinet in Salisbury, Wilson was enraged, declaring that a central condition of the summit had been that he and Smith would have <a href="plenipotentiary">plenipotentiary</a> powers to make a deal. According to J R T Wood, Wilson and his <a href="Attorney%20General%20for%20England%20and%20Wales">Attorney General</a> <a href="Frederick%20Elwyn%20Jones%2C%20Baron%20Elwyn-Jones">Sir Elwyn Jones</a> then "bullied Smith for two long days" to try to get him to settle, without success.

A working document was ultimately produced and signed by Smith, Wilson and Gibbs, to be accepted or rejected in its entirety by each Cabinet after the Prime Ministers returned home. Whitehall accepted the proposals, but Salisbury turned them down; Smith announced on 5 December 1966 that while he and his ministers were largely satisfied with the terms, the Cabinet did not feel it could responsibly abandon the 1965 constitution while so much uncertainty surrounded the transition and the new "mythical constitution yet to be evolved". Rhodesia's Leader of the Opposition <a href="Josiah%20Gondo">Josiah Gondo</a> promptly demanded Smith's resignation, reasoning that the Cabinet's rejection of the working document he had helped to draft amounted to a vote of no confidence. The RF ignored him. Warning that "grave actions must follow", Wilson took the Rhodesia problem to the United Nations, which proceeded to institute the first mandatory trade sanctions in its history with <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%20232">Security Council Resolutions 232</a> (December 1966) and <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%20253">253</a> (April 1968). These measures required UN member states to prevent all trade and economic links with Rhodesia.
State press censorship, introduced by the Smith administration on UDI, was lifted in early April 1968, though according to the "<a href="The%20Herald%20%28Glasgow%29">Glasgow Herald</a>" the government retained "considerable powers to control information. It may reflect no more than Mr Smith's growing confidence that nothing—short of a sell-out to Britain—can undermine his position in Rhodesia". The series of Rhodesian High Court cases debating the legality of UDI came to a close five months later on 13 September. A panel of judges headed by <a href="Hugh%20Beadle">Sir Hugh Beadle</a> ruled UDI, the 1965 constitution and Smith's government to be "de jure", prompting the UK Commonwealth Secretary <a href="George%20Thomson%2C%20Baron%20Thomson%20of%20Monifieth">George Thomson</a> to accuse them of breaching "the fundamental laws of the land".

On HMS "Fearless", the British reversed their confrontational approach of the "Tiger" talks and made a marked effort to appear genial and welcoming, mixing socially with the Rhodesians and accommodating Smith in the Admiral's cabin on <a href="HMS%20Kent%20%28D12%29">HMS "Kent"</a>, which was moored alongside. Marked progress towards agreement was made—for example, Wilson dropped altogether the transition period under a colonial Governor—but the Rhodesian delegation now demurred on a new British proposal, the "double safeguard". This would involve elected black Rhodesians controlling a blocking quarter in the Rhodesian parliament, and thereafter having the right to appeal passed legislation to the <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Privy Council</a> in London. Smith's team accepted the principle of the blocking quarter but agreement could not be reached on the technicalities of it; the involvement of the UK Privy Council was rejected by Smith as a "ridiculous" provision that would prejudice Rhodesia's sovereignty. The "Fearless" summit ended with a joint Anglo-Rhodesian statement asserting that "both sides recognise that a very wide gulf still remains", but were prepared to continue negotiations in Salisbury. This never occurred.

With their hopes of Commonwealth realm status through a settlement with Britain dimming, Smith and the RF began to seriously consider the alternative of a republic as early as December 1966, after the "Tiger" talks. Republicanism was presented as a means to clarify Rhodesia's claimed constitutional status, end ambiguity regarding ties with Britain and elicit official foreign recognition and acceptance. Smith's government began exploring a republican constitution in March 1967. The <a href="Union%20Jack">Union Jack</a> and Rhodesia's Commonwealth-style <a href="flag%20of%20Rhodesia">national flag</a>—a <a href="Defacement%20%28flag%29">defaced</a> <a href="Blue%20Ensign">Sky Blue Ensign</a> with the Union Jack in the canton—were formally superseded on 11 November 1968, the third anniversary of UDI, by a new national flag: a green-white-green vertical <a href="Triband%20%28flag%29">triband</a>, <a href="Charge%20%28heraldry%29">charged</a> centrally with the <a href="coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Rhodesia">Rhodesian coat of arms</a>. After the electorate voted "yes" in a June 1969 <a href="Rhodesian%20constitutional%20referendum%2C%201969">referendum</a> both to a new constitution and to the abandoning of symbolic ties to the Crown, Smith declared Rhodesia a republic on 2 March 1970. The 1969 constitution introduced a <a href="President%20of%20Rhodesia">President</a> as head of state, a multiracial senate, separate black and white electoral rolls (each with qualifications) and a mechanism whereby the number of black MPs would increase in line with the proportion of income tax revenues paid by black citizens. This process would stop once blacks had the same number of seats as whites; the declared goal was not majority rule, but rather "parity between the races".
No country recognised the Rhodesian republic. The RF was decisively returned to power in the first <a href="Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201970">election</a> held as a republic, on 10 April 1970, winning all 50 white seats. Hopes for an Anglo-Rhodesian rapprochement were boosted two months later when the Conservatives won a surprise <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201970">election</a> victory in the UK. <a href="Edward%20Heath">Edward Heath</a> took over as Prime Minister while Douglas-Home became <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Affairs">Foreign Secretary</a>. Talks between Douglas-Home and Smith began with a lengthy meeting in Salisbury in April 1971 and continued until a tentative understanding was reached in early November. A UK delegation headed by Douglas-Home and the Attorney General <a href="Peter%20Rawlinson%2C%20Baron%20Rawlinson%20of%20Ewell">Sir Peter Rawlinson</a> flew to Salisbury on 15 November for negotiations over a new constitution, and after six days of discussion an accord was signed on 21 November 1971.

The constitution agreed upon was based largely on the one Rhodesia had just adopted, but would eventually bring about a black majority in parliament. Black representation in the House would be immediately increased, and a majority of both black and white MPs would have to approve retrogressive legislation; blacks would thus wield an effective veto "as long as they voted solidly together", <a href="Robert%20Blake%2C%20Baron%20Blake">Robert Blake</a> comments. "The principle of majority rule was enshrined with safeguards ensuring that there could be no legislation which could impede this," Smith wrote in his memoirs. "On the other hand, there would be no mad rush into <a href="one%20man%2C%20one%20vote">one man, one vote</a> with all the resultant corruption, nepotism, chaos and economic disaster which we had witnessed in all the countries around us."

The UK announced a test of opinion in Rhodesia to be undertaken by a four-man commission headed by the veteran judge <a href="Edward%20Pearce%2C%20Baron%20Pearce">Lord Pearce</a>. All four population groups—black, white, <a href="coloured">coloured</a> (mixed) and <a href="Indians%20in%20Zimbabwe">Asian</a>—would have to approve the terms for Britain to proceed. ZANU and ZAPU supporters quickly formed the <a href="United%20African%20National%20Council">African National Council</a> (later the United African National Council, or UANC) to organise and co-ordinate black opposition to the deal. Bishop <a href="Abel%20Muzorewa">Abel Muzorewa</a>, the first black man to have been ordained as such in Rhodesia, was installed as the movement's leader. The Pearce Commission finished its work on 12 March 1972 and published its report two months later—it described white, coloured and Asian Rhodesians as in favour of the terms by 98%, 97% and 96% respectively, and black citizens as against them by an unspecified large majority. This came as a great shock to the white community "and a deep disappointment to those in Britain who hoped to get rid of this tiresome albatross", Blake records. Smith condemned the Pearce Commissioners as "naive and inept". The UK withdrew from negotiations, but neither government abandoned the accord entirely. "I would ask them [the black people of Rhodesia] to look again very carefully at what they rejected," Douglas-Home told the House of Commons; "the proposals are still available because Mr Smith has not withdrawn or modified them."

The <a href="Rhodesian%20Bush%20War">Rhodesian Bush War</a> (or Second "<a href="Chimurenga">Chimurenga</a>"), which had been underway at a low level since before UDI, began in earnest in December 1972 when ZANLA attacked farms in north-eastern Rhodesia. The <a href="Rhodesian%20Security%20Forces">Rhodesian Security Forces</a> mounted a strong counter-campaign over the next two years. Muzorewa re-engaged with Smith in August 1973, accepting the 1971–72 Douglas-Home terms, and the two signed a statement to that effect on 17 August. The UANC executive repudiated this in May 1974, but talks between Smith and Muzorewa continued sporadically. The RF again won a clean sweep of the 50 white seats in the July 1974 <a href="Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201974">general election</a>.

Rhodesia's early counter-insurgency successes were undone by political shifts in the guerrillas' favour overseas. The April 1974 <a href="Carnation%20Revolution">Carnation Revolution</a> in Lisbon led to Mozambique's transformation over the next year from a Portuguese territory friendly to Smith's government into a <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Mozambique">communist state</a> openly allied with ZANU. Wilson and Labour returned to power in Britain in March 1974. Portugal's withdrawal made Rhodesia hugely dependent on South Africa, but Smith still insisted that he held a strong position. "If it takes one year, five years, ten years, we're prepared to ride it out," he told the RF congress on 20 September 1974. "Our stand is clear and unambiguous. Settlement is desirable, but only on our terms."

The geopolitical situation tilted further against Smith in December 1974 when the South African Prime Minister <a href="B.%20J.%20Vorster">B J Vorster</a> pressured him into accepting a <a href="d%C3%A9tente">détente</a> initiative involving the <a href="Frontline%20States">Frontline States</a> of Zambia, Tanzania and Botswana (Mozambique and Angola would join the following year). Vorster had concluded that Rhodesia's position was untenable and that South African interests would be better served by collaborating with black African governments over a Rhodesian settlement; he hoped that success in this might win South Africa some international legitimacy and allow it to retain apartheid. Détente forced a ceasefire, giving the guerrillas time to regroup, and required the Rhodesians to release the ZANU and ZAPU leaders so they could attend a conference in Rhodesia, united under the UANC banner and led by Muzorewa. When Rhodesia stopped releasing black nationalist prisoners on the grounds that ZANLA and ZIPRA were not observing the ceasefire, Vorster harried Smith further by withdrawing the <a href="South%20African%20Police">South African Police</a>, which had been helping the Rhodesians patrol the countryside. Smith remained stubborn, saying in the run-up to the conference that "We have no policy in Rhodesia to hand over to a black majority government" and that his government instead favoured "a qualified franchise for all Rhodesians ... [to] ensure that government will be retained in responsible hands for all times".
Nkomo remained unchallenged at the head of ZAPU, but the ZANU leadership had become contested between its founding president, the Reverend <a href="Ndabaningi%20Sithole">Ndabaningi Sithole</a>, and <a href="Robert%20Mugabe">Robert Mugabe</a>, a former teacher from <a href="Mashonaland">Mashonaland</a> who had recently won an internal election in prison. When they were released in December 1974 under the détente terms, Mugabe went to Mozambique to consolidate his leadership of the guerrillas, while Sithole joined Muzorewa's delegation. It had been agreed that the talks would take place within Rhodesia, but the black nationalists refused to meet on ground they perceived as not neutral. The Rhodesians insisted on abiding by the accord and negotiating inside the country. To please both camps the conference was held on a train halfway across the <a href="Victoria%20Falls%20Bridge">Victoria Falls Bridge</a> on the border between Rhodesia and Zambia; the delegations sat on opposite sides of the frontier. The <a href="Victoria%20Falls%20Conference%20%281975%29">conference</a>, which took place on 26 August 1975 with Kaunda and Vorster as mediators, failed to produce a settlement; each side accused the other of being unreasonable. Smith afterwards held direct talks with Nkomo and ZAPU in Salisbury, but these also led nowhere; Nkomo proposed an immediate transition to an interim government headed by himself, which Smith rejected. Guerrilla incursions picked up strongly in the first months of 1976.

On 20 March 1976, Smith gave a televised speech including what became his most quoted utterance. "I don't believe in majority rule ever in Rhodesia—not in 1,000 years," he said. "I repeat that I believe in blacks and whites working together. If one day it is white and the next day it is black, I believe we have failed and it will be a disaster for Rhodesia." The first sentence of this statement became commonly quoted as evidence that Smith was a crude racist who would never compromise with the black nationalists, even though the speech was one in which Smith had said that power-sharing with black Rhodesians was inevitable and that "we have got to accept that in the future Rhodesia is a country for black and white, not white as opposed to black and vice versa". The "not in 1,000 years" comment was, according to <a href="Peter%20Godwin%20%28writer%29">Peter Godwin</a>, an attempt to reassure the RF's right wing, which opposed any transition whatsoever, that white Rhodesians would not be sold out. In her 1978 biography of Smith, Berlyn comments that regardless of whether the statement was "taken out of context, or whether his actual intent was misinterpreted", this was one of his greatest blunders as Prime Minister as it gave obvious ammunition to his detractors.
<a href="Henry%20Kissinger">Henry Kissinger</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">US Secretary of State</a>, announced a formal interest in the Rhodesian situation in February 1976, and over the next half-year held discussions with Britain, South Africa and the Frontline States in what became the "Anglo-American initiative". Meeting Smith in <a href="Pretoria">Pretoria</a> on 18 September 1976, Kissinger proposed majority rule after a transition period of two years. According to Smith, Kissinger told him he considered his participation in the "demise of Rhodesia" to be "one of the great tragedies of my life". He strongly encouraged Smith to accept his deal, though he knew it was unpalatable to him, as any future offer could only be worse from Smith's standpoint—especially if, as expected, US President <a href="Gerald%20Ford">Gerald Ford</a> lost the upcoming <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201976">election</a> to <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a>. Smith expressed great reluctance, but agreed on 24 September after Vorster intimated that South Africa might cut off financial and military aid if he refused. It was the first time Smith had publicly accepted the principles of unconditional majority rule and one man, one vote. However, the Frontline States then abruptly revised their stance and turned the Kissinger terms down, saying that any transition period was unacceptable. Britain quickly arranged an all-party conference in <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a>, Switzerland to try to salvage a solution. ZANU and ZAPU announced that they would attend this and any summit thereafter as a joint "Patriotic Front" (PF), including members of both parties under a combined leadership. The <a href="Geneva%20Conference%20%281976%29">Geneva Conference</a>, held between October and December 1976 under British mediation, also failed.

Smith's moves towards a settlement with black nationalist groups prompted outrage in sections of Rhodesian Front's right wing, but he remained unassailable within the party as a whole, which had in late 1975 granted him a mandate to negotiate for the best possible settlement however he saw fit. The split in the party ultimately led to the defection in July 1977 of 12 RF MPs after Smith introduced legislation to remove racial criteria from the Land Tenure Act. 

The loss of these seats to the breakaway <a href="Rhodesian%20Action%20Party">Rhodesian Action Party</a>, which opposed any conciliation with black nationalists, meant that Smith now only barely had the two-thirds majority in parliament he would need to change the constitution, as he would have to in the event of a settlement. He therefore called an early <a href="Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201977">election</a>, and on 31 August 1977 roundly defeated the defectors—"the dirty dozen", the RF called them—as well as all other opposition; for the third time in seven years, the RF had won all 50 white seats. The party revolt turned out to be a blessing in disguise for Smith, Berlyn comments, as it allowed him to "shed the dead wood of the right wing", giving him more freedom in negotiations with the nationalists. The need for a settlement was becoming urgent—the war was escalating sharply, white emigration was climbing and the economy was starting to struggle as the UN sanctions finally began to have a serious effect.
In March 1978, Smith and non-militant nationalist groups headed by Muzorewa, Sithole and Chief <a href="Jeremiah%20Chirau">Jeremiah Chirau</a> agreed what became the "<a href="Internal%20Settlement">Internal Settlement</a>", under which the country would be reconstituted as <a href="Zimbabwe%20Rhodesia">Zimbabwe Rhodesia</a> in June 1979 after <a href="Zimbabwe%20Rhodesia%20general%20election%2C%201979">multiracial elections</a>. ZANU and ZAPU were invited to participate, but refused; Nkomo sardonically dubbed Smith's black colleagues "the blacksmiths". The deal was badly received abroad, partly because it kept the police, the military, the judiciary and the civil service in white hands. There would be a senate of 20 blacks and 10 whites, and whites would be reserved 28 out of 100 seats in the new House of Assembly. Smith and Nkomo re-entered negotiations in August 1978, but these ended after ZIPRA shot down an <a href="Air%20Rhodesia">Air Rhodesia</a> passenger flight on 3 September and <a href="Air%20Rhodesia%20Flight%20825">massacred survivors</a> at the crash site. Smith cut off talks, introduced <a href="martial%20law">martial law</a> across most of the country and ordered reprisal attacks on guerrilla positions. Smith, Muzorewa and Sithole toured the US in October 1978 to promote their settlement, and met Kissinger, Ford and others including the future President <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>. On 11 December, ZANLA attacked Salisbury's oil storage depot, causing a fire that lasted six days and destroyed a quarter of Rhodesia's fuel. Two months later ZIPRA <a href="Air%20Rhodesia%20Flight%20827">downed</a> another civilian flight, this time killing all on board.

After whites endorsed the Internal Settlement by 85% in a <a href="Rhodesian%20constitutional%20referendum%2C%201979">referendum</a> on 30 January 1979, Smith dissolved the Rhodesian parliament for the last time on 28 February. The RF won all the white seats in the April 1979 elections while Muzorewa and the UANC won a majority in the common roll seats with 67% of the popular vote; the PF rejected this, however, as did the UN, which passed a <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%20448">resolution</a> branding it a "sham". Sithole, astounded that his party had won only 12 seats to the UANC's 51, suddenly turned against the settlement and alleged that the polls had been stage-managed in Muzorewa's favour. Mugabe dismissed the bishop as a "neocolonial puppet" and pledged to continue ZANLA's campaign "to the last man"; Nkomo similarly committed ZIPRA. On 1 June 1979, the day of the country's official reconstitution as Zimbabwe Rhodesia, Muzorewa replaced Smith as Prime Minister, at the head of a <a href="Government%20of%20Zimbabwe%20Rhodesia">UANC–RF coalition Cabinet</a> made up of 12 blacks and five whites. Smith was included as <a href="Minister%20without%20portfolio">Minister without portfolio</a>; Nkomo promptly dubbed him the "Minister with all the portfolios".

An observer group from the UK Conservative Party did regard the April 1979 elections as fair, and <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>, the Conservative leader, was personally disposed to recognise Muzorewa's government and lift sanctions. The potential significance of the Conservative victory in the May 1979 British <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201979">general election</a> was not lost on Smith, who wrote to Thatcher: "All Rhodesians thank God for your magnificent victory." The <a href="United%20States%20Senate">US Senate</a> passed a resolution urging President Carter to remove sanctions and declare Zimbabwe Rhodesia legitimate, but Carter and his Cabinet remained strongly opposed. Carter and Thatcher ultimately decided against accepting Zimbabwe Rhodesia, noting the continued international support for the guerrillas. After the <a href="Commonwealth%20Heads%20of%20Government%20Meeting%201979">Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting</a> in <a href="Lusaka">Lusaka</a> in August 1979, the UK Foreign Secretary <a href="Peter%20Carington%2C%206th%20Baron%20Carrington">Lord Carrington</a> invited the Zimbabwe Rhodesian government and the Patriotic Front to attend an all-party constitutional conference at <a href="Lancaster%20House">Lancaster House</a> in London, starting on 10 September.

Smith was part of Muzorewa's delegation at Lancaster House. Several aspects of the Internal Settlement constitution, such as a declaration of human rights and a guarantee that land redistributed by the government would be paid for, were retained; it was also agreed to have 20 reserved white seats out of 100 for at least seven years. Fresh elections would be held during a brief period under a British Governor invested with full executive and legislative powers. The new constitution was agreed on 18 October, and on 12 December 1979 the House of Assembly voted to dissolve itself, ending UDI. <a href="Christopher%20Soames%2C%20Baron%20Soames">Lord Soames</a> arrived in Salisbury later the same day to become Southern Rhodesia's last Governor; among other things he announced that Smith would be granted amnesty for declaring independence. The final <a href="Lancaster%20House%20Agreement">Lancaster House Agreement</a> was signed on 21 December. Smith was the only member of any delegation to openly oppose the accords; he refused to attend the signing ceremony and boycotted the post-agreement party, instead having dinner with former RAF comrades and <a href="Group%20Captain">Group Captain</a> <a href="Sir%20Douglas%20Bader">Sir Douglas Bader</a>.

The UK government and the international community ultimately declared the February 1980 <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201980">general election</a> free and fair, though many observers attested to widespread political violence and intimidation of voters, particularly by ZANU (which added Patriotic Front to its name to become "ZANU–PF"). British monitors in the ZANU–PF-dominated eastern provinces were strongly critical, reporting "brutal 'disciplinary murders' as examples of the fate awaiting those who failed to conform", name-taking and "claims to the possession of machines which would reveal how individuals had voted". The <a href="Commonwealth%20Observer%20Groups">Commonwealth Observer Group</a> acknowledged that irregularities were occurring but ruled that accounts were exaggerated. After the RF won all 20 white seats, Soames announced late on 4 March 1980 that Mugabe and ZANU–PF had won 57 of the 80 common roll seats, giving them a majority in the new House of Assembly. 

Mugabe invited Smith to his house that evening and according to Smith treated him "most courteously"; Mugabe expressed joy at inheriting a "wonderful country" with modern infrastructure and a viable economy, outlined plans for gradual reform that Smith found reasonable, and said that he hoped to stay in regular contact. This meeting had a profound effect on the former Prime Minister. Having denounced Mugabe as an "apostle of Satan" before the election, Smith now publicly endorsed him as "sober and responsible". "If this were a true picture, then there could be hope instead of despair," he recalled in his autobiography. "When I got home I said to Janet that I hoped it was not an hallucination."

The new <a href="Parliament%20of%20Zimbabwe">Zimbabwean parliament</a> opened on 15 May 1980, a month after formal independence from Britain, with Smith as the reconstituted country's first Leader of the Opposition. Continuing a long-standing tradition from the Rhodesian era, the government and opposition entered the House in pairs—Mugabe and Smith walked in side by side with their respective MPs following, "aptly symbolis[ing] the mood of reconciliation", <a href="Martin%20Meredith">Martin Meredith</a> comments. With around 1,000 whites leaving Zimbabwe each month, Smith took to the radio to urge them to stay and give Mugabe's new order a chance, but over half of the country's whites left within three years. As Meredith records, the 100,000 or so who remained "retreated into their own world of clubs, sporting activities, and comfortable living". Mugabe made great efforts when he first took power to endear himself to the white farming community, which accounted for at least 75% of Zimbabwe's agricultural output. Amid booming Zimbabwean commodity prices in the years immediately following 1980, many white commercial farmers came to support Mugabe. The new Prime Minister continued cordially meeting Smith until the RF leader took him to task in 1981 for openly calling for a <a href="one-party%20state">one-party state</a>; Smith said this was putting off foreign investors. Mugabe was not impressed and, according to Smith, refused to ever meet him again.

As Mugabe's main opponent in Parliament at the head of the <a href="Republican%20Front%20%28Zimbabwe%29">Republican Front</a> (as the RF renamed itself in 1981), Smith presented himself as the guardian of what he called Zimbabwe's "white tribe". He spoke gloomily about Zimbabwe's future prospects, repeatedly accused the Mugabe administration of corruption, malevolence and general incompetence, and criticised Mugabe's support for a one-party system. The RF took an increasingly confrontational line in the House after Mugabe and other government ministers began regularly pouring scorn on the white community in national broadcasts and other media. Amid rising tensions with South Africa, various white Zimbabweans were arrested, accused of being South African agents, and tortured. When Smith complained about whites being imprisoned without trial under emergency powers, a number of ZANU–PF MPs pointed out that they themselves had been detained under that same legislation, and for far longer, by Smith's government. Mugabe openly admitted torturing suspected spies, had some who were found not guilty by the High Court immediately rearrested on the street outside, and accused Western critics of caring only because the people in question were white.

Smith visited Britain and the United States in November 1982, and spoke scathingly about Zimbabwe to reporters, claiming that Mugabe was turning the country into a totalitarian Marxist–Leninist dictatorship. Government retribution was immediate. On Smith's return home, police raided an art exhibition hosting him as guest of honour in Harare (as Salisbury had been <a href="place%20names%20in%20Zimbabwe">renamed</a> in April 1982) and took all the attendees in for questioning, ostensibly because of suspicions it might be an illegal political meeting. A week later, police seized his passport, according to a government statement because his criticism of Zimbabwe while abroad constituted "political bad manners and hooliganism". Police meticulously searched his Harare house and Gwenoro over the next week, confiscating firearms, personal papers and a diary. Smith told reporters all this was "part of the game to intimidate me and so demoralise the whites". Some RF MPs left the party to sit with ZANU–PF or as independents, feeling that constantly confronting Mugabe was ill-advised and unnecessary. Smith remained convinced that nobody would stand up for white Zimbabweans if they did not stick together and defend their interests in parliament.

<a href="Smith%20Hempstone">Smith Hempstone</a> later wrote that the former Prime Minister had resolved to "go down ... with all rhetorical guns blazing". This was in spite of increasingly unstable health; in June 1982 he collapsed in the House of Assembly, clutching at his side and shaking. Half a year later he had to arrange treatment in South Africa for a condition stemming from <a href="Atherosclerosis">hardening of the arteries</a>. The government's confiscation of his passport and two refusals of its return prevented him from going, so in April 1983 Smith successfully applied for a <a href="British%20passport">British passport</a>. "I'll still try to get my Zimbabwean passport back," he said. "I was born here and that is the passport I should travel on." Smith regained his Zimbabwean papers after about a year. In 1984 he declared his intention to renounce his British nationality to abide by a new Zimbabwean law outlawing <a href="multiple%20citizenship">multiple citizenship</a>. Britain did not recognise this legislation; according to Smith, British officials refused to take his UK passport when he tried to return it.

After the already tense relations between ZANU–PF and ZAPU disintegrated amid Mugabe's wish to adopt a one-party system in Zimbabwe, Mugabe expelled Nkomo from the government in February 1982, accusing him and ZAPU of plotting a coup. About a year later, Mugabe deployed the North Korean-trained <a href="5th%20Brigade%20%28Zimbabwe%29">5th Brigade</a> to <a href="Matabeleland">Matabeleland</a>, ZAPU's heartland, where it massacred thousands of civilians accused of supporting "dissidents" in what became called "<a href="Gukurahundi">Gukurahundi</a>". Meredith asserts that this far exceeded anything that had occurred during the Bush War, an opinion shared by Geoff Hill. Some white farmers were also killed. Estimates for the number of deaths during the five-year "Gukurahundi" campaign range from 10,000 to 30,000. Mugabe concurrently took steps to marginalise the other main black nationalist leaders from the "Chimurenga". Nkomo fled to the UK in March 1983, fearing for his life; Sithole similarly exiled himself in the United States. Muzorewa stayed in Zimbabwe and was detained in late 1983 for alleged "subversive links" with South Africa. On arriving in England, Nkomo accused Mugabe of genocide and asserted that "Things are worse now than they ever were under Ian Smith". Mugabe denied that anything improper was happening and put reports to the contrary down to "reactionary foreign journalists".

The Zimbabwean government publicly threatened Smith on a regular basis, but in practice left him and his property largely untouched—Mugabe frequently pointed to Smith's freedom as evidence of Zimbabwe's reconciliation policy. Smith renamed the RF the <a href="Conservative%20Alliance%20of%20Zimbabwe">Conservative Alliance of Zimbabwe</a> (CAZ) on 21 July 1984, concurrently removing racial criteria for membership and inviting black Zimbabweans to join. The CAZ was very successful in the 1985 <a href="Zimbabwean%20parliamentary%20election%2C%201985">parliamentary election</a>, winning 15 of the 20 white seats; Smith won decisively in Bulawayo Central. Mugabe interpreted this as "the racists of this country" defying his government and rejecting reconciliation, and immediately pledged to abolish the white seats, which he said compromised "the sovereignty of our people". After Smith described Mugabe's government as "illiterate" on <a href="BBC%20television">BBC television</a> in November 1985, Mugabe told the House of Assembly Smith was "an incorrigible racist" who "should long ago have been hanged and hanged publicly". Later that month, Smith's close friend and long-standing political associate "Boss" Lilford, who had provided much of the finance to form the RF, was found beaten and shot to death on his ranch. Smith described Lilford afterwards as a man "who was prepared to die for [his] principles", but refused to openly discuss any possible political motive, saying simply that "it would be premature to come to conclusions".

Smith was by now in the twilight of his career, but his outspoken, confrontational stance continued to irritate the ZANU–PF government. He was declared a "fifth columnist" by the Information Minister <a href="Nathan%20Shamuyarira">Nathan Shamuyarira</a> in February 1987 after he advised a group of South African businessmen that they could survive economic sanctions if white South Africans stood together. Three months later, after he was suspended from the Zimbabwean parliament for a year over his comments in South Africa and criticism of ZANU–PF, he resigned as leader of the CAZ. His four decades as an MP formally ended in September 1987 when, as allowed under the Lancaster House terms, ZANU–PF scrapped the white seats amid sweeping constitutional reforms. The office of Prime Minister was abolished in October; Mugabe became the country's first <a href="executive%20president">executive</a> <a href="President%20of%20Zimbabwe">President</a> two months later. Mugabe and Nkomo signed a unity accord at the same time merging ZAPU into ZANU–PF with the stated goal of a Marxist–Leninist one-party state.

This marked the end of Smith's front-line political career—<a href="Gerald%20Smith%20%28Zimbabwean%20politician%29">Gerald Smith</a> (no relation) replaced him as leader of the CAZ—but he remained active in opposition at a reduced level. In July 1992 he chaired a meeting where the CAZ, Muzorewa's UANC, Sithole's <a href="Zimbabwe%20African%20National%20Union%20%E2%80%93%20Ndonga">ZANU–Ndonga</a> party and <a href="Edgar%20Tekere">Edgar Tekere</a>'s <a href="Zimbabwe%20Unity%20Movement">Zimbabwe Unity Movement</a> formed a coalition to challenge Mugabe and ZANU–PF in the next parliamentary election. The result was the short-lived United Front, which Smith agreed to chair, saying he had no more political ambitions and could therefore be regarded as a neutral figurehead. The United Front quickly failed, largely due to the lack of common ground between the constituent parties, and never contested an election. Another brief collaboration between Smith, Muzorewa and Sithole in March 2000 also led to nothing.

The elderly Ian Smith lived in an unassuming house in Harare where, according to <a href="David%20Blair%20%28journalist%29">David Blair</a>, "the front gate always stood open and virtually anyone who walked up the drive would be invited in for tea". He still owned Gwenoro, but employed a manager to run it after Janet's death in 1994. He insisted that he would never leave Zimbabwe. "Don't get fazed by the riots, hold your head high, do not be afraid," a friend reported him saying. "Show you are not budging and the government will leave you alone." He dedicated much of his 1997 autobiography, "", to criticising the Mugabe administration and a long succession of British figures he considered to have let him and Rhodesia down; he also defended and attempted to justify his actions as Prime Minister, and praised <a href="Nelson%20Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a>, calling him Africa's "first black statesman". Smith's enduring popularity among white Zimbabweans was evidenced by the long queues they formed to have him sign copies of the book on its release in Harare in December 1997. "They were captured, hiding their faces and turning to the wall, as television cameras recorded their 'betrayal' for the evening news," Josephine Fisher records. Not all of the country's whites admired Smith; some felt that his obstinate refusal to acknowledge what they saw as past errors caused the whole white community to be resented and viewed with suspicion.

According to Meredith, governmental mismanagement and widespread corruption within the ZANU–PF order led to Mugabe and others enriching themselves considerably at the expense of the country as a whole. In Meredith's view, the average Zimbabwean was worse off in 2000 than he had been in 1980: "average wages were lower, unemployment had trebled, public services were crumbling, and life expectancy was falling". Opposition to ZANU–PF grew, particularly in the towns and cities. In 2000, hoping to win support from rural blacks, Mugabe introduced a fast-track land reform programme under which groups of ZANU–PF activists, officially referred to as "war veterans", were sent to take over white-owned farms so the land could be split up, without compensation, and redistributed to black peasant farmers. White farmers and their black employees were violently forced out, food production plummeted, and the economy collapsed to half the size it had been in 1980.

When a group of about 50 ZANU–PF activists briefly invaded Gwenoro in May 2000, Smith played down the incident, saying the intruders were just bored and out of work. "There's no politics on the farm," he said. Five months later, in England to address the <a href="Oxford%20Union">Oxford Union</a>, Smith described Mugabe as "mentally deranged". The President announced in response that Smith would be arrested and tried for genocide if he ever came back to Zimbabwe, a threat that Smith mocked. "I would love that. Let him try it," he said—"It would give me the chance to tell the world the truth about this gangster ... I will give him the date and time of arrival of my plane so he can meet me at the airport." A mass of reporters descended on <a href="Harare%20International%20Airport">Harare International Airport</a> on 7 November 2000 to witness Smith's arrest, but far from being detained, the former Prime Minister was greeted cheerily by immigration officers and allowed through without any obstruction. Telling the waiting pressmen that he was disappointed not to have met any confrontation, he commented: "We have a president here who is mentally unstable and makes statements that have no bearing on reality", and went home unmolested.

In early September 2001, ZANU–PF militants again attempted to force Smith off his farm. The former Prime Minister telephoned the provincial Governor, who promptly sent police to remove the invaders. According to Smith, the trespassers were shocked to hear the authorities were taking his side, and left before the police even arrived. Half a year later, Smith lost his Zimbabwean passport as a result of further tightening of the law regarding multiple citizenship. New legislation passed in 2001 required Zimbabwean citizens to disavow any claim to other nationalities, even if they did not hold foreign passports. Insisting that Mugabe's government had no right to strip him of Zimbabwean citizenship, Smith refused to renounce his right to British nationality, though he had not held a UK passport for years. Zimbabwean authorities duly refused to renew Smith's passport in March 2002. State press reported that he had "automatically ceased to be a citizen of Zimbabwe" on the passport's expiry, having failed to renounce British citizenship before a deadline on 8 January that year. Smith claimed that his Zimbabwean citizenship had been illegally revoked and that he was now <a href="statelessness">stateless</a>, an assertion disputed by the Minister of Home Affairs <a href="John%20Nkomo">John Nkomo</a>, who said that Smith could stay in the country, but would not receive a new Zimbabwean passport until he renounced his right to British nationality.

By 2002, the white community in Zimbabwe had shrunk to no more than 50,000 people, of whom many, like Smith, were elderly. Smith had by this time lost most of his former international prominence—his visit to the UK in 2004 to meet Conservative politicians was largely ignored by the British press—but he achieved new domestic popularity and eminence among Zimbabwean opposition supporters, who came to see him as an unbreakable, defiant symbol of resistance to the Mugabe government. According to <a href="R.%20W.%20Johnson">R W Johnson</a>, a speech he gave to students at the <a href="University%20of%20Zimbabwe">University of Zimbabwe</a> condemning Mugabe and ZANU–PF as incompetent and corrupt "gangsters" earned him a standing ovation. In 2002, Smith challenged Mugabe to come with him to a township to see who got the best welcome. "Only one of us will come out alive," Smith said; "I'm ready to put that to the test right now. He's not."

Smith travelled to South Africa for medical treatment in 2005, and moved into a retirement home overlooking the sea in <a href="St%20James%2C%20Cape%20Town">St James</a>, a southern suburb of Cape Town. He was reportedly devastated by the death of his son Alec from a heart attack at <a href="London%20Heathrow%20Airport">London Heathrow Airport</a> in January 2006. Despite some marked differences—Alec had used illegal drugs in his youth, and openly opposed his father's policies while he was Prime Minister—they had been very close. The elder Smith had referred to his son as "my rock". Smith's stepdaughter Jean, who had married the prominent Rhodesian singer-songwriter <a href="Clem%20Tholet">Clem Tholet</a> in 1967, was by this time also widowed. She and Robert Smith cared for their stepfather in his final years.

After some weeks of illness, Ian Smith died in Cape Town on 20 November 2007 at the age of 88, having suffered a stroke. Jean was with him. His ashes were returned to Zimbabwe and scattered by his family at Gwenoro. The farm continued to operate under the ownership of Smith's stepchildren until December 2012, when it was expropriated by the Mugabe regime as part of the land reform programme and given to a technical college.

Investigations into alleged <a href="electoral%20fraud">electoral fraud</a> during the 2008 <a href="Zimbabwean%20presidential%20election%2C%202008">presidential</a> and <a href="Zimbabwean%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202008">parliamentary elections</a> in Zimbabwe, when ZANU–PF was accused of using dead "ghost voters" to counter <a href="Morgan%20Tsvangirai">Morgan Tsvangirai</a> and the <a href="Movement%20for%20Democratic%20Change%20%E2%80%93%20Tsvangirai">Movement for Democratic Change</a> (MDC), revealed that Smith and hundreds of thousands of other dead people were still on the electoral roll. According to the Zimbabwe Election Support Network's audit report, published in 2011, deceased "voters" made up 27% of the registered electorate. Mugabe had insisted during his ultimately victorious campaign in 2008 that he would not allow the MDC to take power even if it won, asserting that "only God" could remove him from office. Smith was finally struck off the voters' roll in April 2013, along with 345,000 other dead people. Mugabe resigned the presidency four years later, after ZANU–PF moved to <a href="impeachment">impeach</a> him amid <a href="2017%20Zimbabwean%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">a military coup</a>.

"Smith was a simple man," <a href="Graham%20Boynton">Graham Boynton</a> wrote soon after his death, "and it was his rather humourless, one-dimensional Rhodesian-ness that at once made him a hero among his own people and a figure of derision among his enemies". As leader of the Rhodesian Front and its successors, he was the foremost figure of his country's white community—a "symbol and father figure", in Mordechai Tamarkin's phrase, who as Prime Minister "personified white Rhodesia". Supporters hailed him as "a political visionary ... who understood the uncomfortable truths of Africa"; detractors denounced him as "an unrepentant racist". 

His determination to preserve the white minority's position in Rhodesia caused many black Africans and others to perceive him as a symbol of iniquitous white rule and racism. Smith always denied being driven by racial prejudice—in a 1987 interview he asserted that he had been defending Western principles and that "it was Marxism I fought, not blacks". Above all, he never expressed regret regarding his actions as Prime Minister; he insisted to the end that the political and economic ruination of Zimbabwe under ZANU–PF had borne out his predictions and proven him right.

"The key to understanding Smith," Johnson wrote, "was that, like other white Rhodesians, he clung to an almost Victorian view of the world both in moral values and in the easy assumptions of British primacy that characterised the empire." <a href="Bill%20Schwarz">Bill Schwarz</a> took a similar line, writing that Smith and his supporters reacted to the British Empire's demise by imagining white Rhodesians to be "the final survivors of a lost civilisation", charged with "tak[ing] on the mantle of historic Britain" in the imperial power's absence. "He spoke endlessly about how Rhodesians had been more British than the British," Boynton reflected, "and how this small community of decent, fair-minded whites had been betrayed by, well, just about everybody he could think of ... It was easy to mock Ian Smith, but he was right—both about the betrayals and about the quality of most African politicians". Smith's "not in 1,000 years" quote dominated his obituaries, a development that Peter Godwin, despite his critical stance regarding Smith and his policies, considered "unfair and inaccurate": "Over the years it has become shorn of all context and compressed into a free-floating clip that has now become his epitaph ... But there is more than enough for which to quite legitimately criticise Smith, without resorting to fabrication."

Memories of his travails on Britain's behalf during the Second World War—"undoubtedly the central experience of his life", according to Johnson—were fundamental to the sense of profound betrayal Smith felt when the UK government proved one of his main adversaries as Prime Minister. The wartime plastic surgery that corrected the wounds to his face left its right side paralysed, giving him a crooked smile and a somewhat blank expression, while his bodily injuries gave him a stoop and a slight limp; he also could not sit for long periods without pain. The post-colonial UK Smith encountered as Prime Minister seemed to him "foreign and somewhat effete", to quote Kenneth Young, while Smith was "a foreigner in all but language to most British politicians—a man of convictions so outdated, of tastes so naive, as to make mutual understanding almost impossible." Smith held most of the British politicians he dealt with in extremely low esteem, considering them to have pushed him and his country into an impossible position where, he asserted in 1970, the decision to take unilateral action was "forced upon us".

In his prime, Smith was widely recognised by both contemporaries and rivals as a formidable negotiator. Hempstone considered him "a man too principled (or short-sighted) to compromise with what he regards as wrong", while Welensky compared dealing with him to "trying to nail jelly to a wall". He had an "iron nerve", to quote his RF colleague <a href="P.%20K.%20van%20der%20Byl">P K van der Byl</a>, and a reputation for "icy calm"; he almost never got angry or raised his voice. He spoke with "a nasal monologue" as Peter Younghusband described it—"uninspiring even by Rhodesian oratorical standards". His open, informal association with the general public fostered the impression among white Rhodesians that their Prime Minister was still an "ordinary, decent fellow", which Berlyn cites as a major factor in his enduring popularity. Welensky described him in 1978 as wielding an "almost hypnotic influence" over the Rhodesian electorate, which helped him to win "election after election ... hands down". He also had the grudging respect of at least some of his black nationalist opponents during the Bush War; one, quoted anonymously by "<a href="People%20%28magazine%29">People</a>" magazine in 1976, asserted that "If we had a leader like Mr Smith, we would have won long ago." Sithole, the long-time ZANU leader, said: "Smith is a fighter. He put up a great fight for his people. We were like two bulls in there, the way we fought. He is a man. I respect him."

<a href="Patrick%20Kombayi">Patrick Kombayi</a>, an MDC politician and member of the <a href="Senate%20of%20Zimbabwe">Zimbabwean Senate</a>, said after Smith's death that Zimbabweans had much to thank him for. "The roads that we are using today were all built by Smith," he said. "All the infrastructure is Smith's. We never suffered the way we are suffering now because Smith took care of the economy that supported all people and they had enough to eat. When he left power the [British] <a href="pound%20sterling">pound</a> was on a par with the <a href="Zimbabwean%20dollar">Zimbabwean dollar</a>, but President Mugabe has killed all that." <a href="David%20Coltart">David Coltart</a>, another MDC politician, issued a statement after Smith's death praising him as a man of modesty and integrity, but criticising what Coltart felt to be "disastrous political decisions as Prime Minister"; Coltart considered Smith's policies to have radicalised black nationalists, fomented Mugabe's rise to power and thereby "directly contributed to the trauma that Zimbabwe is suffering from today". Godwin took a similar line, describing the emergency powers Smith used to combat black nationalists as "draconian"; he also pointed out that these "levers of repression" had formed the base for much of what Mugabe later did. Lord Carrington spoke scathingly about Smith in a 2005 interview with <a href="Heidi%20Holland">Heidi Holland</a>, saying he disliked both Smith and Mugabe but would choose the latter if he "absolutely had to choose"; Smith was, in his opinion, "a bigoted, stupid man" responsible for all of Zimbabwe's problems.

While acknowledging the privileged position whites had under Smith, several commentators have latterly agreed with his claims that many black Zimbabweans preferred him to Mugabe with hindsight, albeit a very low bar. "Smith's image improved inversely as Mugabe's plummeted," Johnson wrote. "When he walked the streets of Harare, Africans would almost queue up to grasp his hand and wish him well." "If you were to go to Harare today [in 2007] and ask ordinary black Zimbabweans who they would rather have as their leader—Smith or Mugabe—the answer would be almost unanimous", Boynton asserted; "And it would not be Mugabe." 

Smith's death ignited condemnatory remarks in Zimbabwe's Mugabe-controlled state media. Deputy Minister of Information <a href="Bright%20Matonga">Bright Matonga</a> accused Smith of having been a racist, blamed him for the deaths of thousands of people, and asserted that he would "not be mourned or missed here by any decent person". Reactions from Zimbabweans on the street were mixed, however; according to Western journalists, many expressed sadness.

George Augustus Moore (24 February 1852 – 21 January 1933) was an <a href="Ireland">Irish</a> novelist, <a href="Short%20story">short-story writer</a>, poet, <a href="Art">art critic</a>, memoirist and dramatist. Moore came from a <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> landed family who lived at <a href="Moore%20Hall%2C%20Co.%20Mayo">Moore Hall</a> in <a href="Carra%2C%20County%20Mayo">Carra, County Mayo</a>. He originally wanted to be a painter, and studied art in Paris during the 1870s. There, he befriended many of the leading French artists and writers of the day.

As a <a href="naturalism%20%28literature%29">naturalistic</a> writer, he was amongst the first English-language authors to absorb the lessons of the French <a href="Literary%20realism">realists</a>, and was particularly influenced by the works of <a href="%C3%89mile%20Zola">Émile Zola</a>. His writings influenced <a href="James%20Joyce">James Joyce</a>, according to the literary critic and biographer <a href="Richard%20Ellmann">Richard Ellmann</a>, and, although Moore's work is sometimes seen as outside the mainstream of both Irish and British literature, he is as often regarded as the first great modern Irish novelist.

George Moore's family had lived in Moore Hall, near <a href="Lough%20Carra">Lough Carra</a>, <a href="County%20Mayo">County Mayo</a>, for almost a century. The house was built by his paternal great-grandfather—also called George Moore—who had made his fortune as a wine merchant in <a href="Alicante">Alicante</a>.
The novelist's grandfather was a friend of <a href="Maria%20Edgeworth">Maria Edgeworth</a>, and author of "An Historical Memoir of the French Revolution". His great-uncle, <a href="John%20Moore%20%28Irish%20politician%29">John Moore</a>, was president of the Province of <a href="Connacht">Connacht</a> in the short-lived <a href="Irish%20Republic%20%281798%29">Irish Republic</a> of 1798 during the <a href="Irish%20Rebellion%20of%201798">Irish Rebellion of 1798</a>.
The novelist's father, <a href="George%20Henry%20Moore%20%28politician%29">George Henry Moore</a>, sold his stable and hunting interests during the <a href="Great%20Irish%20Famine">Great Irish Famine</a>, and from 1847 to 1857 served as an Independent Member of Parliament (MP) for <a href="Mayo%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Mayo</a> in the <a href="British%20House%20of%20Commons">British House of Commons</a>. George Henry was renowned as a fair landlord, fought to uphold the rights of tenants, and was a founder of the <a href="Catholic%20Defence%20Association">Catholic Defence Association</a>. His estate consisted of 5000 ha (50 km²) in Mayo, with a further 40 ha in <a href="County%20Roscommon">County Roscommon</a>.

George Moore was born in Moore Hall in 1852. As a child, Moore enjoyed the novels of <a href="Sir%20Walter%20Scott">Walter Scott</a>, which his father read to him. He spent a good deal of time outdoors with his brother, <a href="Maurice%20George%20Moore">Maurice George Moore</a>, and also became friendly with the young Willie and <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a>, who spent their summer holidays at nearby <a href="Moytura">Moytura</a>. Oscar was to later quip of Moore: "He conducts his education in public".

His father had again turned his attention to horse breeding and in 1861 brought his champion horse, "Croagh Patrick", to England for a successful racing season, together with his wife and nine-year-old son. For a while George was left at Cliff's stables until his father decided to send George to his alma mater facilitated by his winnings. Moore's formal education started at <a href="Oscott%20College">St. Mary's College, Oscott</a>, a Catholic boarding school near <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> where he was the youngest of 150 boys. He spent all of 1864 at home, having contracted a lung infection brought about by a breakdown in his health. His academic performance was poor while he was hungry and unhappy. In January 1865, he returned to St. Mary's College with his brother Maurice, where he refused to study as instructed and spent time reading novels and poems. That December the principal, Spencer Northcote, wrote a report that: "he hardly knew what to say about George." By the summer of 1867 he was expelled, for (in his own words) 'idleness and general worthlessness', and returned to Mayo.
His father once remarked, about George and his brother Maurice: "I fear those two redheaded boys are stupid", an observation which proved untrue for all four boys.

In 1868, Moore's father was again elected MP for Mayo and the family moved to London the following year. Here, Moore senior tried, unsuccessfully, to have his son follow a career in the military though, prior to this, he attended the <a href="South%20Kensington%20School%20of%20Art">School of Art</a> in the <a href="Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum">South Kensington Museum</a> where his achievements were no better. He was freed from any burden of education when his father died in 1870. Moore, though still a minor, inherited the family estate that was valued at £3,596. He handed it over to his brother Maurice to manage and in 1873, on attaining his majority, moved to Paris to study art. It took him several attempts to find an artist who would accept him as a pupil. Monsieur Jullian, who had previously been a shepherd and circus masked man, took him on for 40 francs a month. At Académie Jullian he met Lewis Weldon Hawkins who became Moore's flatmate and whose trait, as a failed artist, show up in Moore's own characters. He met many of the key artists and writers of the time, including <a href="Pissarro">Pissarro</a>, <a href="Degas">Degas</a>, <a href="Pierre-Auguste%20Renoir">Renoir</a>, <a href="Monet">Monet</a>, <a href="Alphonse%20Daudet">Daudet</a>, <a href="St%C3%A9phane%20Mallarm%C3%A9">Mallarmé</a>, <a href="Turgenev">Turgenev</a> and, above all, <a href="%C3%89mile%20Zola">Zola</a>, who was to prove an influential figure in Moore's subsequent development as a writer.

While still in Paris his first book, a collection of lyric poems called " The Flowers of Passion", was self-published in 1877. The poems were derivative, and were maliciously reviewed by the critics who were offended by some of the depravities in store for moralistic readers. The book was withdrawn by Moore. He was forced to return to Ireland in 1880 to raise £3,000 to pay debts incurred on the family estate due to his tenants refusing to pay their rent and the drop in agricultural prices. During his time back in Mayo, he gained a reputation as a fair landlord, continuing the family tradition of not evicting tenants and refusing to carry firearms when travelling round the estate. While in Ireland, he decided to abandon art and move to London to become a professional writer. There he published his second poetry collection, "Pagan Poems", in 1881. These early poems reflect his interest in <a href="French%20symbolism">French symbolism</a> and are now almost entirely neglected. In 1886 Moore published "<a href="Confessions%20of%20a%20Young%20Man">Confessions of a Young Man</a>", a lively memoir about his 20s spent in Paris and London among bohemian artists. It contains a substantial amount of literary criticism for which it has received a fair amount of praise, for instance <a href="The%20Modern%20Library">The Modern Library</a> chose it in 1917 to be included in the series as "one of the most significant documents of the passionate revolt of English literature against the Victorian tradition."

During the 1880s, Moore began work on a series of novels in a <a href="realism%20%28arts%29">realist</a> style. His first novel, "A Modern Lover" (1883) was a three-volume work, as preferred by the <a href="Subscription%20library">circulating libraries</a>, and deals with the art scene of the 1870s and 1880s in which many characters are identifiably real. The circulating libraries in England banned the book because of its explicit portrayal of the amorous pursuits of its hero. At this time the British circulating libraries, such as <a href="Charles%20Edward%20Mudie">Mudie's Select Library</a>, controlled the market for fiction and the public, who paid fees to borrow their books, expected them to guarantee the morality of the novels available. His next book, a novel in the realist style, "A Mummers Wife" (1885) was also regarded as unsuitable by Mudie's and <a href="W%20H%20Smith">W H Smith</a> refused to stock it on their news-stalls. Despite this, during its first year of publication the book was in its fourteenth edition mainly due to the publicity stirred up by its opponents. The French newspaper "<a href="Le%20Voltaire%20%28newspaper%29">Le Voltaire</a>" published it in serial form as "La Femme du cabotin" in July–October 1886. His next novel "A Drama in Muslin" was banned by Mudie's and Smith's. In response Moore declared war on the circulating libraries by publishing two provocative <a href="pamphlet">pamphlet</a>s; "Literature at Nurse" and "Circulating Morals". In these, he complained that the libraries profit from salacious popular fiction while refusing to stock serious literary fiction.

Moore's publisher <a href="Henry%20Vizetelly">Henry Vizetelly</a> began to issue <a href="unabridged">unabridged</a> mass-market translations of French realist novels that endangered the moral and commercial influence of the circulating libraries around this time. In 1888, the circulating libraries fought back by encouraging the House of Commons to implement laws to stop "the rapid spread of demoralising literature in this country". However, Vizetelly was brought to court by the <a href="National%20Vigilance%20Association">National Vigilance Association</a> (NVA) for "obscene libel". The charge arose due to the publication of the English translation of Zola's "<a href="La%20Terre">La Terre</a>". A second case was brought the following year to force implementation of the original judgement and to remove all of Zola's works. This led to the 70-year-old publisher becoming involved in the literary cause. Throughout Moore stayed loyal to Zola's publisher, and on 22 September 1888, about a month before the trial, wrote a letter that appeared in the "St. James Gazette". In it Moore suggested that it was improper for Vizetelly's fate to be determined by a jury of "twelve tradesmen", explaining that it would be preferable to be judged by three novelists. Moore pointed out that the NVA could make the same claims against such books as "<a href="Madame%20Bovary">Madame Bovary</a>" and <a href="Th%C3%A9ophile%20Gautier">Gautier's</a> "Mademoiselle de Maupin", as their morals are equivalent to Zola's, though their literary merits might differ.

Because of his willingness to tackle such issues as prostitution, extramarital sex and lesbianism, Moore's novels were initially met with disapproval. However, as the public's taste for realist fiction grew, this subsided. Moore began to find success as an art critic with the publication of books such as "Impressions and Opinions" (1891) and "Modern Painting" (1893)—which was the first significant attempt to introduce the <a href="Impressionist">Impressionist</a>s to an English audience. By this time Moore was first able to live from the proceeds of his literary work.

Other realist novels by Moore from this period include "A Drama in Muslin" (1886), a satiric story of the marriage trade in Anglo-Irish society that hints at same-sex relationships among the unmarried daughters of the gentry, and "<a href="Esther%20Waters">Esther Waters</a>" (1894), the story of an unmarried housemaid who becomes pregnant and is abandoned by her footman lover. Both of these books have remained almost constantly in print since their first publication. His 1887 novel "A Mere Accident" is an attempt to merge his symbolist and realist influences. He also published a collection of short stories: "Celibates" (1895).

In 1901, Moore returned to Ireland to live in Dublin at the suggestion of his cousin and friend, <a href="Edward%20Martyn">Edward Martyn</a>. Martyn had been involved in Ireland's cultural and dramatic movements for some years, and was working with <a href="Lady%20Gregory">Lady Gregory</a> and <a href="William%20Butler%20Yeats">William Butler Yeats</a> to establish the <a href="Abbey%20Theatre">Irish Literary Theatre</a>. Moore soon became deeply involved in this project and in the broader <a href="Celtic%20Revival">Irish Literary Revival</a>. He had already written a play, "The Strike at Arlingford" (1893), which was produced by the <a href="Independent%20Theatre">Independent Theatre</a>. The play was the result of a challenge between Moore and <a href="George%20Robert%20Sims">George Robert Sims</a> over Moore's criticism of all contemporary playwrights in "Impressions and Opinions". Moore won the one hundred pound bet made by Sims for a stall to witness an "unconventional" play by Moore, though Moore insisted the word "unconventional" be excised.
The Irish Literary Theatre staged his satirical comedy "The Bending of the Bough" (1900), adapted from Martyn's "The Tale of a Town", originally rejected by the theatre but unselfishly given to Moore for revision, and Martyn's "Maeve". Staged by the company who would later become the <a href="Abbey%20Theatre">Abbey Theatre</a>, "The Bending of the Bough" was a historically important play and introduced realism into Irish literature. Lady Gregory wrote that it: "hits impartially all round". The play was satire on Irish political life, and as it was unexpectedly nationalist, was considered the first to deal with a vital question that had appeared in Irish life. "<a href="Diarmuid%20and%20Grania">Diarmuid and Grania</a>", a poetic play in prose co-written with Yeats in 1901, was also staged by the theatre, with incidental music by <a href="Elgar">Elgar</a>. After this production Moore took up <a href="pamphleteer">pamphleteer</a>ing on behalf of the Abbey, and parted company with the dramatic movement.

Moore published two books of prose fiction set in Ireland around this time; a second book of short stories, "The Untilled Field" (1903) and a novel, "The Lake" (1905). "The Untilled Field" deal with themes of clerical interference in the daily lives of the Irish peasantry, and of the issue of emigration. The stories were originally written for translation into Irish, to serve as models for other writers working in the language. Three of the translations were published in the "New Ireland Review", but publication was then paused due to a perceived <a href="anti-clerical">anti-clerical</a> sentiment. In 1902 the entire collection was translated by <a href="Tadhg%20%C3%93%20Donnchadha">Tadhg Ó Donnchadha</a> and <a href="P%C3%A1draig%20%C3%93%20S%C3%BAilleabh%C3%A1in">Pádraig Ó Súilleabháin</a>, and published in a parallel-text edition by the <a href="Gaelic%20League">Gaelic League</a> as "An-tÚr-Ghort". Moore later revised the texts for the English edition. These stories were influenced by <a href="Turgenev">Turgenev</a>'s "A Sportsman's Sketches", a book recommended to Moore by <a href="William%20Kirkpatrick%20Magee">W. K. Magee</a>, a sub-librarian of the <a href="National%20Library%20of%20Ireland">National Library of Ireland</a>, and had earlier suggested that Moore "was best suited to become Ireland's Turgenev". The tales are recognised by some as representing the birth of the Irish short story as a literary genre.

In 1903, following a disagreement with his brother Maurice over the religious upbringing of his nephews, Moore declared himself to be Protestant. His conversion was announced in a letter to the "<a href="Irish%20Times">Irish Times</a>" newspaper. Moore remained in Dublin until 1911. In 1914, he published a gossipy, three-volume memoir of his time there under the collective title "Hail and Farewell", which entertained its readers but infuriated former friends. Moore himself said of these memoirs, "Dublin is now divided into two sets; one half is afraid it will be in the book, and the other is afraid that it won't".

In his later years he was increasingly friendless, having quarrelled bitterly with Yeats and <a href="Osborn%20Bergin">Osborn Bergin</a>, among others: <a href="Oliver%20St.%20John%20Gogarty">Oliver St. John Gogarty</a> said: "It was impossible to be a friend of his, because he was incapable of gratitude".

Moore returned to London in 1911, where, with the exception of frequent trips to France, he was to spend much of the rest of his life. In 1913, he travelled to <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> to research for his next novel, "The Brook Kerith" (1916). The book saw Moore once again embroiled in controversy, as it was based on the supposition that a non-divine <a href="Jesus%20Christ">Christ</a> did not die on the cross but instead was nursed back to health. Other books from this period include a further collection of short-stories called "A Storyteller's Holiday" (1918), a collection of essays called "Conversations in Ebury Street" (1924) and a play, "The Making of an Immortal" (1927). Moore also spent considerable time revising and preparing his earlier writings for new editions.

Partly due to Maurice's pro-<a href="Anglo-Irish%20Treaty">treaty</a> activity, Moore Hall was burnt by anti-treaty forces in 1923, during the final months of the <a href="Irish%20Civil%20War">Irish Civil War</a>. Moore eventually received compensation of £7,000 from the government of the <a href="Irish%20Free%20State">Irish Free State</a>. By this time George and Maurice had become estranged, mainly because of an unflattering portrait of the latter which appeared in "Hail and Farewell". Tension also arose as a result of religious differences: Maurice frequently made donations to the Roman Catholic Church from estate funds. Moore later sold a large part of the estate to the <a href="Irish%20Land%20Commission">Irish Land Commission</a> for £25,000.

Moore was friendly with many members of the expatriate artistic communities in London and Paris, and had a long-lasting relationship with <a href="Maud%20Cunard">Maud, Lady Cunard</a>. Moore took a special interest in the education of Maud's daughter, the well-known publisher and art patron, <a href="Nancy%20Cunard">Nancy Cunard</a>. It has been suggested that Moore, rather than Maud's husband, <a href="Cunard%20baronets">Sir Bache Cunard</a>, was Nancy's father, but this is not generally credited by historians, and it is not certain that Moore's relationship with Nancy's mother was ever other than platonic. Moore was believed by some to be impotent and was described as "one who told but didn't kiss". Moore's last novel, "Aphroditis in Aulis", was published in 1930.

He died at his home at <a href="Ebury%20Street">Ebury Street</a> in the London district of <a href="Belgravia">Belgravia</a> in early 1933, leaving a fortune of £70,000. He was cremated in London at a service attended by <a href="Ramsay%20MacDonald">Ramsay MacDonald</a> among others. An urn containing his ashes was interred on Castle Island in Lough Carra in view of the ruins of Moore Hall.

Sonic Adventure

Following the cancellation of the <a href="Sega%20Saturn">Sega Saturn</a> game "<a href="Sonic%20X-treme">Sonic X-treme</a>", <a href="Sonic%20Team">Sonic Team</a> began work on "Sonic Adventure" in 1997. A 60-member development team created the game in ten months, drawing inspiration from locations in <a href="Peru">Peru</a> and <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>. <a href="Yuji%20Uekawa">Yuji Uekawa</a> redesigned the characters for their transition to 3D, and features were added to take advantage of the Dreamcast hardware. Sega announced the game in August 1998; it was released in Japan that December and worldwide in September 1999.

The game received critical acclaim and, with 2.5 million copies sold by August 2006, became the Dreamcast's bestseller. Reviewers lauded the visuals and gameplay, calling it a major technological advancement; some speculated that it could re-establish Sega as the dominant console manufacturer after the relatively unsuccessful Saturn. Others were frustrated by the camera controls and glitches, and reactions to its audio were mixed. Despite this, journalists have ranked "Sonic Adventure" among the best "Sonic" games, and it is recognized as an important release in both the series and the platform genre. A sequel, "<a href="Sonic%20Adventure%202">Sonic Adventure 2</a>", was released in 2001.

"Sonic Adventure" was <a href="porting">ported</a> to the <a href="GameCube">GameCube</a> and <a href="Windows">Windows</a> in 2003 as "Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut", featuring updated graphics and more challenges. A <a href="High-definition%20video">high-definition</a> version was released digitally for the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> in 2010, and for Windows in 2011. Reviews for these versions were less positive; critics felt the game had not aged well and ran at an inconsistent <a href="frame%20rate">frame rate</a>.

"Sonic Adventure" is a 3D <a href="platform%20game">platform game</a> with <a href="action%20game">action</a> and <a href="Role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing</a> elements. Players control one of six <a href="Anthropomorphism">anthropomorphic</a> protagonists as they venture to defeat <a href="Doctor%20Robotnik">Doctor Robotnik</a> and his robot army, who seek the seven magical <a href="Chaos%20Emeralds">Chaos Emeralds</a> and the evil entity <a href="Chaos%20%28Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20character%29">Chaos</a>. Six <a href="player%20character">player character</a>s are unlocked as the game progresses, each with their own story and attributes. <a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28character%29">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> performs a spin dash, homing attack, and light-speed dash; <a href="Tails%20%28character%29">Miles "Tails" Prower</a> flies, swims, and attacks robots using his tails; <a href="Knuckles%20the%20Echidna">Knuckles the Echidna</a> glides, climbs walls, and punches; <a href="Amy%20Rose">Amy Rose</a> can defeat enemies using her hammer; <a href="Big%20the%20Cat">Big the Cat</a> is slow and carries a <a href="fishing%20rod">fishing rod</a> he can cast; and <a href="E-102%20Gamma">E-102 Gamma</a> can shoot laser beams.

At the start of the game, the player is placed in one of several Adventure Fields, open-ended <a href="Overworld%23Platform%20games">hub worlds</a> inhabited by advice-giving <a href="non-player%20character">non-player character</a>s. The player character is guided and instructed by the voice of <a href="Tikal%20the%20Echidna">Tikal the Echidna</a>. Through exploration, the player discovers entrances to <a href="Level%20%28video%20gaming%29">levels</a> called Action Stages, some of which must be opened using keys hidden in the Adventure Field. Once the player accesses an Action Stage, they are tasked with a specific objective, which is different for each character. Sonic and Amy must reach the level's end; Tails must reach the end before Sonic; Knuckles must find three hidden shards of the Master Emerald; Big must fish for his pet frog; and Gamma must fight his way through stages using projectiles as a defense.

Some levels include <a href="minigame">minigame</a>s separate from the main story. These feature different styles of gameplay, among them <a href="Shoot%20%27em%20up%23Rail%20shooters">rail shooting</a>, <a href="racing%20video%20game">racing</a>, and <a href="sandboarding">sandboarding</a>. Some minigames can only be accessed with particular characters. Fulfilling certain objectives allows the player to obtain bonus items. Unlocked minigames and stages the player has completed can be accessed from a Trial Mode on the <a href="title%20screen">title screen</a>.

Like previous "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>" games, players collect golden <a href="Rings%20%28Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%29">rings</a> as a form of <a href="health%20%28gaming%29">health</a>: if the player character is in possession of rings when they are hit by an enemy or other hazard, they will survive, but their rings will scatter and blink before disappearing. Canisters containing <a href="power-up">power-up</a>s such as speed shoes, additional rings, <a href="invincibility">invincibility</a>, and elemental shields are also hidden in levels. In several stages, the player engages Robotnik or Chaos in a <a href="boss%20fight">boss fight</a> and must deplete the boss's health meter to proceed. Each character starts with a limited number of <a href="Life%20%28gaming%29">lives</a>, and the player loses a life if the character drowns, gets crushed, or is hit without any rings in their possession. The game ends when the player runs out of lives. Lives can be replenished by collecting 100 rings or a <a href="1-up">1-up</a>.

Players may also discover Chao Gardens, hidden, protective environments inhabited by <a href="Chao%20%28Sonic%29">Chao</a>, a <a href="virtual%20pet">virtual pet</a>. Players can hatch, name, and interact with a Chao, and raise the status of their Chao by giving it small animals found by defeating robots. The Dreamcast's handheld <a href="Visual%20Memory%20Unit">Visual Memory Unit</a> (VMU) allows the player to download the <a href="minigame">minigame</a> "Chao Adventure", in which their Chao walks through a course to evolve and improve its skills. Evolving one's Chao improves its performance in competitions called Chao Races. Eggs that can produce special types of Chao are hidden throughout the Adventure Fields. Players can earn emblems by playing through Action Stages, searching through the Adventure Fields, or winning Chao Races. Each Action Stage has three emblems that can be earned by replaying the stages and fulfilling objectives, such as beating the level within a time limit.

Doctor Robotnik seeks a new way to defeat his longtime nemesis Sonic and conquer the world. During his research, he learns about an entity called Chaos—a creature that, thousands of years ago, helped to protect the Chao and the all-powerful <a href="Master%20Emerald">Master Emerald</a>, which balances the power of the seven Chaos Emeralds. When a tribe of <a href="echidna">echidna</a>s sought to steal the power of the Emeralds, breaking the harmony they had with the Chao, Chaos retaliated by using the Emeralds' power to transform into a monstrous beast, Perfect Chaos, and wipe them out. Before it could destroy the world, Tikal, a young echidna who befriended Chaos, imprisoned it in the Master Emerald along with herself.

Seeking to use Chaos, Robotnik releases it from the Master Emerald, and tests the creature's natural form on the city of Station Square. When Sonic sees local police fail to defeat it, he and Tails work to stop Robotnik from empowering it with the Chaos Emeralds. At the same time, Knuckles, the only remaining echidna, sets out to find the shards of the Master Emerald and repair it. Activating a new series of robots, including one named Gamma, Robotnik orders them to find Froggy, an amphibian who had eaten a Chaos Emerald after mutating from contact with a piece of Chaos the night he was released. His owner Big seeks to find him as well. In Station Square, Sonic's friend Amy finds a <a href="Flicky">Flicky</a> being pursued for a Chaos Emerald in its possession, and decides to protect it. When both are captured, Amy convinces Gamma not to work for Robotnik, who helps her to escape, before seeking out and destroying the other robots in his series, sacrificing himself in the process.

Despite Sonic managing to disrupt Robotnik's plans, Chaos manages to absorb all the Chaos Emeralds. Transforming into Perfect Chaos, it rebels against Robotnik and attacks Station Square, devastating the city. Having experienced flashbacks from Tikal, who was released herself, Sonic realizes that Chaos has been in constant torment and sorrow, and that imprisoning it again will not stop it. Using the Emeralds brought to him by the others to transform into his <a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%23Super%20transformation">super form</a>, Sonic fights Perfect Chaos and defeats it. Returned to normal, Chaos calms down when he sees the Chao living peacefully in Station Square. Realizing its pain is gone, Tikal decides to take it somewhere safe to live in peace. With Sonic having won, he decides to leave to pursue a fleeing Robotnik.

During the early 1990s, <a href="Sega">Sega</a> was one of the most successful video game companies due to its <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Genesis</a> console. Sales for the console were driven by the popularity of its flagship franchise of 2D platformers, "Sonic the Hedgehog". During this time, series co-creator <a href="Yuji%20Naka">Yuji Naka</a> worked with <a href="Sega%20Technical%20Institute">Sega Technical Institute</a> (STI) in the United States to develop "Sonic" games. After the completion of "<a href="Sonic%20%26amp%3B%20Knuckles">Sonic & Knuckles</a>" in 1994, Naka moved to work with <a href="Sonic%20Team">Sonic Team</a> in Japan. STI began developing "<a href="Sonic%20X-treme">Sonic X-treme</a>" for the <a href="Sega%20Saturn">Sega Saturn</a>"," which would have been the first "Sonic the Hedgehog" game to feature full <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D</a> gameplay. "X-treme" suffered a series of setbacks and was canceled in 1997. The cancellation is an important factor in the Saturn's <a href="List%20of%20commercial%20failures%20in%20video%20gaming">commercial failure</a>; without it, the system had no original "Sonic" platformer. Meanwhile, Naka and Sonic Team developed original Saturn games, such as "<a href="Nights%20into%20Dreams">Nights into Dreams</a>." Due to the series' relative lack of presence on the Saturn, according to "<a href="Retro%20Gamer">Retro Gamer</a>", "[b]y mid-1997 Sonic had essentially been shuffled into the background... it was astonishing to see that just six years after his debut, Sonic was already retro."

Naka still wanted to make a 3D "Sonic" game, and felt that only Sonic Team should do it; for this reason, he refused to let STI use the "Nights" <a href="game%20engine">game engine</a> for "X-treme", a factor in that game's cancellation. In August 1996, "Nights into Dreams" designer <a href="Takashi%20Iizuka%20%28game%20designer%29">Takashi Iizuka</a> proposed a role-playing-style "Sonic" game with a greater emphasis on storytelling, which formed the basis of "Sonic Adventure". Iizuka felt that "Sonic" fans had been let down because the team was not focusing on the series. Additionally, <a href="Kazuyuki%20Hoshino">Kazuyuki Hoshino</a>, who would serve as art director on "Sonic Adventure", said he thought during the Saturn era Sonic had become outdated and strove to reinvent the character.

Sonic Team started to work on "Sonic Adventure" in April 1997 on the Saturn with a 20-strong team. Sonic Team created the first prototype using the "Nights" engine, but the Saturn's limited capabilities made development difficult. Sega president <a href="Hayao%20Nakayama">Hayao Nakayama</a> informed Naka of the Saturn's successor, the Dreamcast, and he believed the new console would allow Sonic Team to create the ultimate "Sonic" game. When the team learned the Dreamcast was nearing completion, they moved development to take advantage of its greater quantity of RAM, stronger <a href="CPU">CPU</a>, and the VMU. Not wanting to waste their completed work, they placed it as a bonus in the <a href="Product%20bundling">compilation game</a> "<a href="Sonic%20Jam">Sonic Jam</a>", the final "Sonic" game for the Saturn. In July 1997, Sonic Team began redeveloping "Sonic Adventure" for the Dreamcast, and the team expanded to 60.

Iizuka served as director on "Sonic Adventure", while Naka produced. Although at the time one of the largest video games created, "Sonic Adventure" was completed in a relatively brief 10 months. Sonic Team undertook development in conjunction with the Dreamcast, aiming to release the game in December 1998, even if it meant making improvements after release. Developing "Sonic Adventure" at the same time as the system, which was not completed until two months before the game's release, gave Iizuka influence over the console's development; for example, he was able to request more <a href="RAM">RAM</a> for the console specifically for "Sonic Adventure".

Sonic Team felt challenged by the new hardware to recreate Sonic and his world in a new way. They began development using the character designs from the Genesis games, but quickly discovered the characters' bodies were too short and their heads too big, making them difficult to see. <a href="Yuji%20Uekawa">Yuji Uekawa</a> redesigned each character to suit the transition to 3D and to give them "new, edgy, more Western" design. Looking to the animation of <a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a> and "<a href="Looney%20Tunes">Looney Tunes</a>" for inspiration, he made Sonic more mature, taller, and slimmer, and gave him longer quills. He darkened his blue color and gave him green irises in reference to <a href="Green%20Hill%20Zone">Green Hill Zone</a>. Uekawa tried to make Sonic look like a comic book character and compared the style to graffiti. After redesigning Sonic, he made the other characters fit this new art style.

Because "Sonic Adventure" was a Dreamcast <a href="launch%20title">launch title</a>, the team strove to demonstrate the console's capabilities with realistic graphics, which they felt would appeal to consumers. To achieve a more realistic feel for the environments, the core members of Sonic Team visited temples, jungles, and ancient ruins in <a href="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a>n landscapes, including <a href="Cancun">Cancun</a>, <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>, and <a href="Peru">Peru</a>. While Sonic Team members had to draw artwork by hand for games in the past, for "Sonic Adventure" they were able to use photographs taken during their visits as <a href="texture%20mapping">textures</a>. The greatest influences were the <a href="Tikal">Tikal</a> ruin in Guatemala and <a href="Machu%20Picchu">Machu Picchu</a> in Peru. The character Tikal was inspired by Peru and took her name from the Guatemalan ruins. The team also wanted to add elements unexpected in a platform game; the level in which Tails sandboards was inspired by a group of sandboarders in <a href="Ica%2C%20Peru">Ica, Peru</a>. The 3D visuals were created using a <a href="Voodoo2">Voodoo2</a> graphics chip.

One of the biggest challenges the designers faced was transitioning the series' 2D style to 3D. In the Genesis "Sonic" games, the player simply had to go right to reach the end of a level, but in "Sonic Adventure" they could move in every direction. The designers created <a href="3D%20modeling">models</a> for the stages before testing it as the player character, resulting in trial and error. Some levels, such as the Lost World, were rebuilt dozens of times; others referenced past Sega games, such as Ice Cap ("<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%203">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>") and the Tornado levels ("<a href="Panzer%20Dragoon">Panzer Dragoon</a>"). One particular difficulty was defeating enemies; in the 2D games, enemies were beaten simply by jumping on them, but this was harder to achieve in a 3D game. Therefore, Sonic was given the ability to target enemies in mid-air. Iizuka said the cinematic sequences were conceived to take advantage of the environments, "giving the player an element of discovery in addition to the platforming".

Stages featured gameplay similar to the original Genesis games and were designed to take at least five minutes to complete. Sonic Team split levels into parts to save memory. Because "Sonic Adventure" had a stronger emphasis on storytelling than previous games in the series, the team implemented hub worlds to "draw the players deeper into the world." The hub worlds' emphasis on exploring to find new areas and power-ups was inspired by "<a href="The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a>". When seeing the completed level designs, Iizuka and Naka decided to re-purpose them for other player characters. Iizuka said they felt it would be "a waste if Sonic just quickly ran through the levels that we spent so much time creating". The first characters besides Sonic added to the game were Tails and Knuckles; Tails' stages turned portions of Sonic's levels into races, while Knuckles' treasure-hunting missions were designed as a contrast to the others' straightforward ones. "Sonic Adventure" was the first time Amy was playable in a "Sonic" platformer, and Iizuka aimed to use her to add tension, such as hiding from pursuers, that Sonic's gameplay could not offer.

"Sonic Adventure" features two new playable characters, Big and Gamma. Sonic Team had already implemented an in-game fishing rod with no context or use, leading to the creation of Big. Big was designed to be giant and relaxed so the player would not expect something more intense. Gamma and his playstyle were created in response to fans who wanted elements of a <a href="shoot%20%27em%20up">shoot 'em up</a> in "Sonic" and because of Iizuka's desire to include "some type of satisfying gameplay that couldn't be done with Sonic". Neither Big nor Gamma were intended to play a large role, thus both of their campaigns were short. Iizuka also wanted to create a villain who would have been impossible to make on older hardware. He settled on something liquid and transparent and created Chaos. Iizuka presented the concept to Naka, who was impressed. Chaos was originally intended to have realistic blue scales in his final form, but this was abandoned because of the technological constraints of the Dreamcast.

According to Iizuka, the team tried to include as much content as possible. One addition was the Chao-raising system, which Iizuka conceived to take advantage of the VMU. Sonic Team had used a similar virtual pet system, the "A-Life", in "Nights into Dreams"; Iizuka used the A-Life as a base, while improving it with the VMU and the option to improve its skills. Iizuka hoped it would be made into a character players could touch and raise. It was also designed to appeal to casual gamers not familiar with games like "Sonic", and to add <a href="replay%20value">replay value</a>. The design took considerable time to finalize and had to be made as simple as possible because the virtual pet's look changes form as it evolves.

While some "Sonic" games, such as 1993's "<a href="Sonic%20CD">Sonic CD</a>", contained limited voice work, "Sonic Adventure" was the first "Sonic" game to feature extensive <a href="voice%20acting">voice acting</a>. The decision was made early in development as the game was more story-focused than previous "Sonic" games. Sonic Team's staff had differing opinions about how Sonic should sound. Iizuka recalled that the only element they agreed on was to avoid using an <a href="anime">anime</a> voice actor, favoring a film actor with an "over-the-top" voice. Sonic Team cast <a href="Jun%27ichi%20Kanemaru">Jun'ichi Kanemaru</a> as Sonic. In an interview celebrating his 30th anniversary as a voice actor, Kanemaru said one reason he was cast was because of his ability to speak English. The English-language voice cast consists of <a href="Ryan%20Drummond">Ryan Drummond</a> as Sonic, Corey Bringas as Tails, <a href="Michael%20McGaharn">Michael McGaharn</a> as Knuckles, Jennifer Douillard as Amy, <a href="Jon%20St.%20John">Jon St. John</a> as Big, and Deem Bristow as Robotnik.

"Sonic Adventure"s score was primarily composed by <a href="Jun%20Senoue">Jun Senoue</a>, with additional music by Fumie Kumatani, Kenichi Tokoi, and <a href="Masaru%20Setsumaru">Masaru Setsumaru</a>. The group created the main theme, "Open Your Heart"; other vocal themes were performed by Marion Saunders, Dredd Fox, <a href="Ted%20Poley">Ted Poley</a>, Nikki Gregoroff, <a href="Tony%20Harnell">Tony Harnell</a>, and <a href="Johnny%20Gioeli">Johnny Gioeli</a>. The team preferred "hot, <a href="funk">funk</a>y, and <a href="rock%20%27n%27%20roll">rock 'n' roll</a>" music over the <a href="electropop">electropop</a> of earlier "Sonic" games. Iizuka stated the style was adopted because the Dreamcast's sound was a significant advance from that of the Genesis. Some tracks were rearranged from the 1996 game "<a href="Sonic%203D%20Blast">Sonic 3D Blast</a>". A two-disc soundtrack, "Sonic Adventure "Digi-LOG Conversation" Original Sound Track", was released in Japan in January 1999. In May 2011, a 20th anniversary edition of the soundtrack was released. Digital versions were also released on <a href="iTunes">iTunes</a> and <a href="Spotify">Spotify</a> in September 2014 and January 2017, respectively. <a href="Brave%20Wave%20Productions">Brave Wave Productions</a> released a <a href="vinyl%20LP">vinyl LP</a> version of the soundtrack including interviews with Senoue and Iizuka in 2018.

"Sonic Adventure" was kept a secret during production, though screenshots were leaked in mid-1998 and plans for a 3D "Sonic" game had long been rumored. It was unveiled by Naka and the rest of Sonic Team on August 22, 1998, at the <a href="Tokyo%20International%20Forum">Tokyo International Forum</a>. The team showed off several dynamic elements, such as a chase sequence from the first level and Tails' sandboarding sequence. Naka described the debut as intense, having "[given his] all" to make it fit for release.

On December 23, 1998, "Sonic Adventure" was released in Japan. The Japanese version shipped with many glitches and camera problems; several members of Sonic Team flew to Sega of America to <a href="Patch%20%28computing%29">patch</a> the game, delaying its western release for several months. The localized version was released in North America on September 9, 1999, and in Europe on September 23, 1999. It includes Japanese and English-language audio tracks, as well as Japanese, English, Spanish, French and German subtitles. Online features—including Chao daycare and <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable content</a> (DLC) such as minigames and new level assets—were also added. The localized version was later released in Japan as "Sonic Adventure International".

Prior to the launch of the Dreamcast in the United States, Sega made an exclusive deal with <a href="Hollywood%20Video">Hollywood Video</a> to allow customers to rent the Dreamcast console along with a non-retail version of the game, "Sonic Adventure: Limited Edition". The promotion began on July 15, 1999 and took place at 1,055 Hollywood Video stores across the country.

In 2001, Sega announced it would transition from a first-party to a third-party software publisher. Wanting to reach new players by creating an enhanced version of one of their older games, in June 2003 Sega released "Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut", a <a href="Porting">port</a> of "Sonic Adventure" for the <a href="GameCube">GameCube</a> and <a href="Windows">Windows</a>. While mostly identical to the original release, "Sonic Adventure DX" features updated graphics, including higher-resolution textures and more detailed character models, has a locked <a href="frame%20rate">frame rate</a> of 60 frames per second, and sports a redesigned Chao-raising system that uses connectivity with the <a href="Game%20Boy%20Advance">Game Boy Advance</a> (GBA). It includes 60 new missions and the option to unlock all 12 "Sonic" games released for the <a href="Game%20Gear">Game Gear</a>. <a href="Metal%20Sonic">Metal Sonic</a> can be unlocked as a playable character if all 130 emblems are collected. These features were added to appeal to players of the original game.

In September 2010, Sega rereleased "Sonic Adventure" as a downloadable game for the <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> and <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a>, followed by a Windows release in March 2011 via <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a>. This version is based on "Sonic Adventure DX" and supports <a href="high-definition%20video">high-definition</a> visuals, but the new missions, Metal Sonic, and the Game Gear games were removed; the missions and Metal Sonic can be reimplemented by purchasing them as DLC. The game was also included in the "<a href="Dreamcast%20Collection">Dreamcast Collection</a>" compilation in 2011, and is <a href="List%20of%20Xbox%20360%20games%20compatible%20with%20Xbox%20One">backwards-compatible</a> with the <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a>.

As the first fully 3D "Sonic" platform game, "Sonic Adventure" was highly anticipated. It received critical acclaim, and some critics called it one of <a href="List%20of%20video%20games%20considered%20the%20best">the greatest video games of all time</a>. It is the bestselling Dreamcast game; by August 4, 2006, it had sold 2.5 million copies, including 440,000 in Japan and 1.27 million in the United States.

The visuals and presentation attracted wide acclaim. "Arcade" magazine described it as a "quantum leap forward" in aesthetics and visual detail in video games, and "<a href="Hyper%20%28magazine%29">Hyper</a>" estimated they even exceeded what was possible on high-end personal computers. "<a href="IGN">IGN</a>" called it the most graphically impressive platform game released up to that date, praising its cinematic sequences and describing it as "engrossing, demanding, and utterly awe-inspiring". "<a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>" agreed and said only "<a href="Soulcalibur%20%28video%20game%29">Soulcalibur</a>"s graphical quality surpassed that of "Sonic Adventure". "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" felt the graphical features showed off the Dreamcast's potential to the fullest and that the game was "perfect" as a showcase for the system.

The audio received mixed responses. "GameSpot" and "<a href="Game%20Revolution">Game Revolution</a>" called the <a href="full-motion%20video">full-motion video</a> (FMV) cutscenes and voice acting well-produced and fitting, though "GameSpot" noted poor lip-synching. "IGN" thought the cutscenes were repetitive and voiced strong disapproval of the voice acting, declaring it "a complete joke" and "downright awful". "IGN" had a particular distaste for Tails' voice, and retrospectively called it among the most annoying to feature in a video game. "<a href="AllGame">AllGame</a>" was conflicted; they appreciated Tails' portrayal but found Sonic's and Knuckles' voices unfitting. "GameSpot" and "AllGame" praised the rock-style music, but "Game Revolution" described the score as "absolutely horrible".

The gameplay was generally praised. "GameSpot" admired the straightforward, linear approach to the 3D platform genre and particularly praised it for keeping the basic gameplay of the original Genesis games. "IGN" said the game would keep players busy even after completion, noting its internet connectivity and other extras. On the other hand, "Game Revolution" said apart from being quicker, it did not advance the platform genre's design. Retrospectively, "<a href="1001%20Video%20Games%20You%20Must%20Play%20Before%20You%20Die">1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die</a>" called its environments vast and twisted, stating it "brilliantly" captured traditional "Sonic" elements.

The Chao minigame was noted as a major departure from the gameplay of the series. "GameSpot" wrote that "while really just a diversion", the Chao were an interesting, fun addition, singling out their internet functions as a highlight. "AllGame" said the Chao helped increase the replay value, although it was "strange", required patience, and did not provide bonuses in the main game. "Game Revolution" called the Chao "a neat addition" and praised its use of the VMU.

Some critics compared "Sonic Adventure" to "<a href="Super%20Mario%2064">Super Mario 64</a>"—Nintendo's "groundbreaking" 1996 game that propelled the <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a> and the 3D platform genre. "Edge" said "Sonic Adventure" was a worthy rival to "Super Mario 64", but "AllGame" wrote that "Sonic Adventure" was not as ambitious and that those looking for exploration would be disappointed with its linear gameplay. They compared it to the similarly linear "<a href="Crash%20Bandicoot%20%28video%20game%29">Crash Bandicoot</a>" but felt "Sonic Adventure" was more confined. Still, they praised the gameplay as varied and said its replay value was strong. Game journalists Rusel DeMaria and Johnny L. Wilson retrospectively wrote "Sonic Adventure" was not as strong as "Super Mario 64" and "failed to catch on with players in nearly the way that ["Mario"] had done", though it had fascinating features, such as "the use of the <a href="Tamagotchi">Tamagotchi</a>-like memory card to incubate eggs for little pet creatures" and "some good action segments".

The camera system and glitches were criticized by many reviewers. "IGN" called the camera "incredibly" frustrating and inconsistent, and "GameSpot" noted it caused problems with <a href="collision%20detection">collision detection</a>. "Edge" complained the camera sometimes goes behind walls. Authors from "<a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a>" retrospectively wrote that "Sonic Adventure" was "horrendously buggy", singling out falling through floors and getting stuck, but also said the sheer amount of content made up for this.

"GameSpot" thought "Sonic Adventure" redefined the possibilities of the platform genre, and according to "<a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games">Computer and Video Games</a>" ("CVG"), "many things you thought were impossible to see and experience in computer games are now here". "AllGame" wrote that the game was an impressive showing of the Dreamcast's potential and that it was among the best of the series. "Edge" said its criticisms such as scenery pop-up and instances of poor collision detection are "minor flaws in an otherwise very fine piece of work". "Arcade" and "CVG" speculated the game could save the Dreamcast, which had not sold well by the end of 1998. "CVG" also thought it could re-establish Sega as the dominant console manufacturer after the relatively unsuccessful Saturn.

"Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut" was received less positively than the original. "GameSpot" was disappointed the rerelease did not address the problems of the original version, irritated the graphics were only marginally different, and dissatisfied with its collision detection. They offered some praise for the extra features, such as the missions, but concluded players were better off playing the Dreamcast version. "IGN" agreed, calling it "a sloppy port of a game that has long been undeserving of its high praise." "IGN" noted its frequent frame rate drops and called its camera one of the worst they had ever seen. They said the connectivity to the GBA "Sonic" games added depth but concluded this did not compensate for the problems in the port. "<a href="Nintendo%20World%20Report">Nintendo World Report</a>" was more positive, praising the Game Gear games for retaining their <a href="Multiplayer%20video%20game">multiplayer</a> support and finding Sonic and Tails’ gameplay enjoyable.

Reviews of the 2010 rerelease were generally unfavorable; most of the criticism was directed at the perceived lack of effort put into the port. "IGN" called it "so fundamentally flawed that it borders on unplayable", observing that the sections that worked best required the least input from the player. They criticized the lack of widescreen support but offered minor praise for its steady frame rate. "<a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a>" lambasted the port for what they called its slapdash quality, criticizing its display, controls, and dated design, and saying it "feels like it wasn't even tuned for the Xbox 360 controller and its analog sticks". "<a href="Destructoid">Destructoid</a>" was less harsh, writing that fans of the franchise would be able to enjoy the game but warned casual players that "all you'll find is a relic that was once considered greatness", and that it pained them to say that.

Prior to the release of "Sonic Adventure", most 3D platform games focused on exploration and collecting items; "Sonic Adventure" changed this with its linear gameplay. According to "GamesRadar", it was one of the first <a href="Sixth%20generation%20of%20video%20game%20consoles">sixth-generation</a> console games and changed the <a href="Video%20game%20industry">industry</a> "forever", despite its glitches. "<a href="Joystiq">Joystiq</a>" wrote that both "Adventure" and the original "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%281991%20video%20game%29">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>" had innovated through effective linear level design and by feeling "good to play". In 2009, "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" listed "Sonic Adventure" as the seventh-best platform game of all time, saying it had not aged well in certain aspects but its core gameplay remained among the best of the "Sonic" series. Several journalists ranked the game among the series' best, but "<a href="Kotaku">Kotaku</a>" argued the addition of voice acting and greater focus on plot changed Sonic into "a flat, lifeless husk of a character, who spits out slogans and generally has only one personality mode, the radical attitude dude, the sad recycled image of vague '90s cultural concept".

Many of "Sonic Adventure"s designs and concepts were reused in later "Sonic" games. The direction, basic gameplay, and Uekawa's modernized character designs became series staples. One level in the 2006 "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%282006%20video%20game%29">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>" <a href="reboot%20%28fiction%29">reboot</a> heavily references "Sonic Adventure"s Emerald Coast stage. To celebrate the "Sonic" series' 20th anniversary in 2011, Sega released "<a href="Sonic%20Generations">Sonic Generations</a>", which reused aspects from past games in the franchise. The Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Windows versions contain reimagined versions of the Speed Highway level and the Perfect Chaos boss fight, and the <a href="Nintendo%203DS">Nintendo 3DS</a> version contains a remake of Emerald Coast.

Several characters that first appeared in "Sonic Adventure" appeared in later games. As well as appearing in "Sonic Generations", Chaos is an antagonist in the 2017 entry "<a href="Sonic%20Forces">Sonic Forces</a>"; it and Gamma are playable characters in the 2004 <a href="fighting%20game">fighting game</a> "<a href="Sonic%20Battle">Sonic Battle</a>"; and a recreation of its boss fight appears in "<a href="Mario%20%26amp%3B%20Sonic%20at%20the%20Olympic%20Winter%20Games">Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games</a>". The Chao creatures also feature predominantly in later games. One of the characters introduced in "Adventure", Big the Cat, became infamous for his negative reception. "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" considered his gameplay painful and boring, while "Destructoid" decried his portrayal as a "mentally handicapped imbecile" and his voice actor's incoherent performance. Big is widely considered by video game journalists the worst character in the "Sonic" franchise, and was named one of the worst game characters in a poll conducted by "1UP.com".

On October 4, 1999, Sega announced that a sequel to "Sonic Adventure" was in development. "<a href="Sonic%20Adventure%202">Sonic Adventure 2</a>" made its debut at <a href="E3%202000">E3 2000</a> and was released in June 2001. The sequel was designed to be more action-oriented than the slower-paced, story-centric "Adventure" and to give all the characters equal playtime. Like its predecessor, "Sonic Adventure 2" received positive reviews. A concept for "Sonic Adventure 3" was reworked into the 2008 game "<a href="Sonic%20Unleashed">Sonic Unleashed</a>". In 2017, Iizuka stated there were no plans for a third "Sonic Adventure" game, saying it would not advance the series' design. He did not rule out the idea, saying "If we can get the gameplay to evolve and get to a place where "Adventure 3" makes sense, then you might see an "Adventure 3" come out". In December 2018, Iizuka expressed interest in <a href="Video%20game%20remake">remaking</a> "Sonic Adventure".

The plot of "Sonic Adventure" was adapted in the second season of the 2003 "Sonic the Hedgehog" <a href="anime">anime</a> series "<a href="Sonic%20X">Sonic X</a>". American licensing corporation <a href="4Kids%20Entertainment">4Kids Entertainment</a> hired a new voice cast for the English-language dub but the Japanese cast from the games reprised their roles in the original version of the show. <a href="Archie%20Comics">Archie Comics</a> also adapted the game in its "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28Archie%20Comics%29">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>" comic book series. The comic offered an explanation for the altered character designs and established that Station Square was hidden beneath Sonic's planet, Mobius.

He made his feature directorial debut in 2017 with "<a href="Molly%27s%20Game">Molly's Game</a>", which he also wrote.

Sorkin's trademark rapid-fire dialogue and extended monologues are complemented, in television, by frequent collaborator <a href="Thomas%20Schlamme">Thomas Schlamme</a>'s characteristic directing technique called the "<a href="walk%20and%20talk">walk and talk</a>".

Sorkin was born in <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, New York City, to a <a href="American%20Jews">Jewish</a> family, and was raised in the New York suburb of <a href="Scarsdale%2C%20New%20York">Scarsdale</a>.

Bill</a>; both his older sister and brother went on to become lawyers. His paternal grandfather was one of the founders of the <a href="International%20Ladies%27%20Garment%20Workers%27%20Union">International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union</a> (ILGWU). Sorkin took an early interest in acting. Before he reached his teenage years, his parents were taking him to the theatre to see shows such as "<a href="Who%27s%20Afraid%20of%20Virginia%20Woolf%3F">Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</a>" and "<a href="That%20Championship%20Season">That Championship Season</a>".

Sorkin attended <a href="Scarsdale%20High%20School">Scarsdale High School</a> where he became involved in the drama and theatre club. In eighth grade he played General Bullmoose in the musical "<a href="Li%27l%20Abner%20%28musical%29">Li'l Abner</a>". At Scarsdale High, he served as vice president of the drama club in his junior and senior years and graduated in 1979.

In 1979, Sorkin attended <a href="Syracuse%20University">Syracuse University</a>. In his <a href="freshman%20year">freshman year</a> he failed a class that was a core requirement a devastating setback because he wanted to be an actor, and the drama department did not allow students to take the stage until they completed all the core freshman classes. Determined to do better, he returned in his sophomore year, and graduated in 1983. Recalling the influence on him at college of drama teacher <a href="Arthur%20Storch">Arthur Storch</a>, Sorkin recalled, after Storch's death in March 2013, that "Arthur's reputation as a director, and as a disciple of <a href="Lee%20Strasberg">Lee Strasberg</a>, was a big reason why a lot of us went to S.U. ... 'You have the capacity to be so much better than you are', he started saying to me in September of my senior year. He was still saying it in May. On the last day of classes, he said it again, and I said, 'How?', and he answered, 'Dare to fail'. I've been coming through on his admonition ever since".

After graduating from <a href="Syracuse%20University">Syracuse University</a> with a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Bachelor of Fine Arts</a> degree in <a href="Musical%20Theatre">Musical Theatre</a> in 1983, Sorkin moved to <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> where he spent much of the 1980s as a struggling, sporadically-employed actor who also worked odd jobs, such as delivering <a href="singing%20telegram">singing telegram</a>s, driving a limousine, touring Alabama with the children's theatre company Traveling Playhouse, handing out fliers promoting a hunting-and-fishing show, and bartending at <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway's</a> <a href="Palace%20Theatre%20%28Broadway%29">Palace Theatre</a>. One weekend, while housesitting at a friend's place he found an <a href="IBM%20Selectric%20typewriter">IBM Selectric typewriter</a>, started typing, and "felt a phenomenal confidence and a kind of joy that [he] had never experienced before in [his] life."

He continued writing and eventually put together his first play, "Removing All Doubt," which he sent to his old Syracuse theatre teacher, Arthur Storch, who was impressed. In 1984, "Removing All Doubt" was staged for drama students at his alma mater, Syracuse University. After that, he wrote "<a href="Hidden%20in%20This%20Picture">Hidden in This Picture</a>" which debuted <a href="Off-Off-Broadway">off-off-Broadway</a> at Steve Olsen's <a href="Laurie%20Beechman%20Theatre">West Bank Cafe Downstairs Theatre Bar</a> in New York City in 1988. The contents of his first two plays got him a <a href="Literary%20agent">theatrical agent</a>. Producer John A. McQuiggan saw the production of "Hidden in This Picture" and commissioned Sorkin to turn the one-act into a full-length play called "Making Movies".

Sorkin got the inspiration to write his next play, a courtroom drama called "<a href="A%20Few%20Good%20Men%20%28play%29">A Few Good Men</a>", from a phone conversation with his sister Deborah, who had graduated from <a href="Boston%20University%20School%20of%20Law">Boston University Law School</a> and signed up for a three-year stint with the <a href="Judge%20Advocate%20General%27s%20Corps%2C%20U.S.%20Navy">U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps</a>. Deborah told Sorkin that she was going to <a href="Guantanamo%20Bay%20Naval%20Base">Guantanamo Bay</a> to defend a group of <a href="Marine%20corps">Marines</a> who came close to killing a fellow Marine in a <a href="hazing">hazing</a> ordered by a superior officer. Sorkin took that information and wrote much of his story on cocktail napkins while bartending at the Palace Theatre. He and his roommates had purchased a <a href="Macintosh%20512K">Macintosh 512K</a> so when he returned home he would empty his pockets of the cocktail napkins and type them into the computer, forming a basis from which he wrote many drafts for "A Few Good Men".

In 1988, Sorkin sold the film rights for "A Few Good Men" to producer <a href="David%20Brown%20%28producer%29">David Brown</a> before it premiered, in a deal that was reportedly "well into six figures". Brown had read an article in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" about Sorkin's one-act play "Hidden in This Picture" and found out Sorkin also had a play called "A Few Good Men" that was having Off Broadway readings. Brown produced "A Few Good Men" on Broadway at the <a href="Music%20Box%20Theatre">Music Box Theatre</a>. It starred <a href="Tom%20Hulce">Tom Hulce</a> and was directed by <a href="Don%20Scardino">Don Scardino</a>. After opening in late 1989, it ran for 497 performances.

Sorkin continued writing "Making Movies" and in 1990 it debuted <a href="Off-Broadway">Off-Broadway</a> at the Promenade Theatre, produced by John A. McQuiggan, and again directed by Don Scardino. Meanwhile, David Brown was producing a few projects at <a href="TriStar%20Pictures">TriStar Pictures</a> and tried to interest them in making "A Few Good Men" into a film but his proposal was declined due to the lack of star actor involvement. Brown later got a call from <a href="Alan%20Horn">Alan Horn</a> at <a href="Castle%20Rock%20Entertainment">Castle Rock Entertainment</a> who was anxious to make the film. <a href="Rob%20Reiner">Rob Reiner</a>, a Castle Rock producing partner, opted to direct it.

In the early 1990s, Sorkin worked under contract for <a href="Castle%20Rock%20Entertainment">Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc.</a> He wrote the scripts for "<a href="A%20Few%20Good%20Men">A Few Good Men</a>", "<a href="Malice%20%281993%20film%29">Malice</a>" and "<a href="The%20American%20President">The American President</a>"; the three films grossed about US$400 million worldwide. While writing for Castle Rock he became friends with colleagues such as <a href="William%20Goldman">William Goldman</a> and Rob Reiner and met his future wife Julia Bingham, who was one of Castle Rock's business affairs lawyers.

Sorkin wrote several drafts of the script for "A Few Good Men" in his Manhattan apartment, learning the craft from a book about <a href="Screenwriting%23Screenwriting%20formats">screenplay format</a>. He then spent several months at the Los Angeles offices of Castle Rock, working on the script with director <a href="Rob%20Reiner">Rob Reiner</a>. William Goldman (who regularly worked under contract at Castle Rock) became his mentor and helped him to adapt his stageplay into a screenplay. The movie was directed by Reiner, starred <a href="Tom%20Cruise">Tom Cruise</a>, <a href="Jack%20Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a>, <a href="Demi%20Moore">Demi Moore</a> and <a href="Kevin%20Bacon">Kevin Bacon</a>, and was produced by Brown. "A Few Good Men" was released in 1992 and was a box office success.

Goldman also approached Sorkin with a story premise, which Sorkin developed into the script for "<a href="Malice%20%281993%20film%29">Malice</a>". Goldman oversaw the project as <a href="creative%20consultant">creative consultant</a> while Sorkin wrote the first two drafts. However, he had to leave the project to finish up the script for "A Few Good Men", so screenwriter <a href="Scott%20Frank">Scott Frank</a> stepped in and wrote two drafts of the "Malice" screenplay. When production on "A Few Good Men" wrapped up, Sorkin took over and resumed working on the "Malice" right through the final <a href="shooting%20script">shooting script</a>. <a href="Harold%20Becker">Harold Becker</a> directed the film, a medical thriller released in 1993, which starred <a href="Nicole%20Kidman">Nicole Kidman</a> and <a href="Alec%20Baldwin">Alec Baldwin</a>. "Malice" had mixed reviews. <a href="Vincent%20Canby">Vincent Canby</a> in "The New York Times" described the film as "deviously entertaining from its start through its finish". <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> gave it 2 out of 4 stars, and <a href="Peter%20Travers">Peter Travers</a> in a 2000 "Rolling Stone" review summarized it as having "suspense but no staying power".

Sorkin's last produced screenplay for Castle Rock was "<a href="The%20American%20President%20%28film%29">The American President</a>" and once again he worked with William Goldman, who served as a creative consultant. It took Sorkin a few years to write the screenplay for "The American President", which started off as a massive 385-page screenplay; it was eventually whittled down to a standard shooting script of around 120 pages. Rob Reiner directed. The film was critically acclaimed. <a href="Kenneth%20Turan">Kenneth Turan</a> in the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" described the film as "genial and entertaining if not notably inspired", and believed its most interesting aspects were the "pipe dreams about the American political system and where it could theoretically be headed".

Sorkin did uncredited <a href="script%20doctor">script doctor</a> work on several films in the 1990s. He wrote some quips for <a href="Sean%20Connery">Sean Connery</a> and <a href="Nicolas%20Cage">Nicolas Cage</a> in "<a href="The%20Rock%20%28film%29">The Rock</a>". He worked on "<a href="Excess%20Baggage%20%281997%20film%29">Excess Baggage</a>", a comedy about a girl who stages her own kidnapping to get her father's attention, and rewrote some of <a href="Will%20Smith">Will Smith</a>'s scenes in "<a href="Enemy%20of%20the%20State%20%28film%29">Enemy of the State</a>".

Sorkin collaborated with <a href="Warren%20Beatty">Warren Beatty</a> on a couple of scripts, one of which was "<a href="Bulworth">Bulworth</a>". Beatty, known for occasionally personally financing his film projects through pre-production, also hired Sorkin to rewrite a script titled "Ocean of Storms" which never went into production. At one point Sorkin sued Beatty for proper compensation for his work on the "Ocean of Storms" script; once the matter was settled, he resumed working on the script.

Sorkin came up with the idea to write about the behind-the-scenes happenings on a sports show while he was living in a room in the <a href="Four%20Seasons%20Hotels%20and%20Resorts">Four Seasons Hotel</a> in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> writing the screenplay for "<a href="The%20American%20President">The American President</a>". He would work late, with the TV tuned into <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a>, watching continuous replays of "<a href="SportsCenter">SportsCenter</a>". The show inspired him to try to write a feature film about a sports show but he was unable to structure the story for film, so instead he turned his idea into a TV comedy series. "<a href="Sports%20Night">Sports Night</a>" was produced by <a href="The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company">Disney</a> and debuted on the Disney-owned <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC network</a> in the fall of 1998.

Sorkin fought with the ABC network during the first season over the use of a <a href="laugh%20track">laugh track</a> and a <a href="Studio%20audience">live studio audience</a>. The laugh track was widely decried by critics as jarring, with <a href="Joyce%20Millman">Joyce Millman</a> of <a href="Salon%20%28website%29">Salon.com</a> describing it as "the most unconvincing laugh track you've ever heard". Sorkin commented that: "Once you do shoot in front of a live audience, you have no choice but to use the laugh track. Oftentimes [enhancing the laughs] is the right thing to do. Sometimes you do need a cymbal crash. Other times, it alienates me." The laugh track was gradually dialed down and was gone by the end of the first season. Sorkin was triumphant in the second season when ABC agreed to his demands, unburdening the <a href="Television%20crew">crew</a> of the difficulties of staging a scene for a live audience and leaving the cast with more time to rehearse.

Although "Sports Night" was critically acclaimed, ABC canceled the show after two seasons due to its low <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">ratings</a>. Sorkin entertained offers to continue the show on other television channels but declined all the offers as they were mainly contingent on his involvement which would have been a difficult prospect given that he was simultaneously writing "<a href="The%20West%20Wing">The West Wing</a>" at that point.

Sorkin conceived the political drama "The West Wing" in 1997 when he went unprepared to a lunch with producer <a href="John%20Wells%20%28filmmaker%29">John Wells</a> and in a panic pitched to Wells a series centered on the senior staff of the White House, using leftover ideas from his script for "<a href="The%20American%20President">The American President</a>". He told Wells about his visits to the White House while doing research for "The American President", and they found themselves discussing <a href="Civil%20service">public service</a> and the passion of the people who serve. Wells took the concept and pitched it to the <a href="NBC">NBC</a> network, but was told to wait because the facts behind the <a href="Lewinsky%20scandal">Lewinsky scandal</a> were breaking and there was concern that an audience would not be able to take a series about the White House seriously. When a year later some other networks started showing interest in "The West Wing", NBC decided to greenlight the series despite their previous reluctance. The pilot debuted in the fall of 1999 and was produced by <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Television">Warner Bros. Television</a>.

"The West Wing" was honored with nine <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award">Primetime Emmy Award</a>s for its <a href="The%20West%20Wing%20%28season%201%29">debut season</a>, making the series a record holder for most Emmys won by a series in a single season at the time. Following the <a href="52nd%20Primetime%20Emmy%20Awards">ceremony</a>, a dispute arose regarding the acceptance speech for <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Writing%20for%20a%20Drama%20Series">Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series</a>. "The West Wing" episode "<a href="In%20Excelsis%20Deo">In Excelsis Deo</a>" won, which was awarded to Sorkin and <a href="Rick%20Cleveland">Rick Cleveland</a>, while it was reported in a "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" article that Cleveland had been ushered off the stage by Sorkin without being given a chance to say a few words. The story behind "The West Wing" episode is based on Cleveland's father, a Korean war veteran who spent the last years of his life on the street, as Cleveland explains in his FreshYarn.com essay titled "I Was the Dumb Looking Guy with the Wire-Rimmed Glasses". A back and forth took place between Sorkin and Cleveland in a public web forum at <a href="Television%20Without%20Pity">Mighty Big TV</a> where Sorkin explained that he gives his writers "Story By" credit on a rotating basis "by way of a gratuity" and that he had thrown out Cleveland's script and started from scratch. In the end, Sorkin apologized to Cleveland. Cleveland and Sorkin also won the at the <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20Awards%202000">53rd Writer Guild of America Awards</a> for "In Excelsis Deo".

In 2001, after wrapping up the <a href="The%20West%20Wing%20%28season%202%29">second season</a> of "The West Wing", Sorkin had a <a href="relapse">drug relapse</a>, only two months after receiving a Phoenix Rising Award for drug recovery; this became public knowledge when he was arrested at <a href="Bob%20Hope%20Airport">Hollywood Burbank Airport</a> for possession of <a href="Psilocybin%20mushroom">hallucinogenic mushrooms</a>, <a href="Cannabis%20%28drug%29">marijuana</a>, and <a href="crack%20cocaine">crack cocaine</a>. He was ordered by a judge to attend a drug diversion program. His drug addiction was highly publicized, most notably when "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>" did a parody called "The West Wing", though he did recover.

In 2002, Sorkin criticized NBC news anchor <a href="Tom%20Brokaw">Tom Brokaw</a>'s TV special about a day in the life of a president, "The Bush White House: Inside the Real West Wing", comparing it to the act of sending a valentine to President George W. Bush instead of real news reporting. Sorkin's TV series "The West Wing" aired on the same network, and so at the request of NBC's Entertainment President <a href="Jeff%20Zucker">Jeff Zucker</a> he apologized, but would later say "there should be a difference between what <a href="NBC%20News">NBC News</a> does and what "The West Wing" TV series does."

Sorkin wrote 87 screenplays in all, which amounts to nearly every episode during the show's first four Emmy-winning seasons. Sorkin describes his role in the creative process as "not so much [that of] a <a href="showrunner">showrunner</a> or a producer. I'm really a writer." He admits that this approach can have its drawbacks, saying "Out of 88 [West Wing] episodes that I did we were on time and on budget never, not once." In 2003, at the end of the <a href="The%20West%20Wing%20%28season%204%29">fourth season</a>, Sorkin and fellow executive producer <a href="Thomas%20Schlamme">Thomas Schlamme</a> left the show due to internal conflicts at Warner Bros. Television not involving the NBC network, thrusting producer John Wells into an expanded role as showrunner. Sorkin never watched any episodes beyond his writing tenure apart from 60 seconds of the fifth season's first episode, describing the experience as "like watching somebody make out with my girlfriend." Sorkin would later return in the series finale for a <a href="cameo%20appearance">cameo appearance</a> as a member of <a href="Josiah%20Bartlet">President Bartlet</a>'s staff.

Sorkin appeared as himself on the "<a href="30%20Rock">30 Rock</a>" episode "<a href="Plan%20B%20%2830%20Rock%29">Plan B</a>", where he did a "walk and talk" with <a href="Liz%20Lemon">Liz Lemon</a> played by <a href="Tina%20Fey">Tina Fey</a>.

In 2003, Sorkin divulged to the American television interviewer <a href="Charlie%20Rose">Charlie Rose</a> on "<a href="Charlie%20Rose%20%28TV%20series%29">The Charlie Rose Show</a>" that he was developing a TV series based on a late-night sketch comedy show like "Saturday Night Live". In early October 2005, a pilot script dubbed "Studio 7 on the Sunset Strip" for a new television series, written by him and with Tommy Schlamme attached as producer, started circulating around Hollywood and generating interest on the web. A week later, NBC bought from <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Television">Warner Bros. Television</a> the right to show the television series on their network for a near-record license fee in a bidding war with CBS. The show's name was later changed to "<a href="Studio%2060%20on%20the%20Sunset%20Strip">Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip</a>". Sorkin described the show as having "autobiographical elements" to it and "characters that are based on actual people" but said that it departs from those beginnings to look at the backstage maneuverings at a late night <a href="sketch%20comedy">sketch comedy</a> show.

On September 18, 2006, the <a href="Pilot%20%28Studio%2060%20on%20the%20Sunset%20Strip%29">pilot</a> for "Studio 60" aired on NBC, directed by Schlamme. The pilot was critically acclaimed and viewed by over 12 million people, but "Studio 60" experienced a significant drop in audience by mid-season. The seething anticipation that preceded the début was followed up by a large amount of thoughtful and scrupulous criticism in the press, as well as largely negative analysis in the <a href="blogosphere">blogosphere</a>. In January 2007, Sorkin spoke out against the press for focusing too heavily on the ratings slide and for using blogs and unemployed comedy writers as sources. After two months on hiatus, "Studio 60" resumed to air the last episodes of season one, which would be its only season.

In 2003, Sorkin was writing a screenplay <a href="Spec%20script">on spec</a> about the story of inventor and television pioneer <a href="Philo%20Farnsworth">Philo Farnsworth</a>, a topic he had first become familiar with back in the early 1990s when producer <a href="Fred%20Zollo">Fred Zollo</a> approached him with the idea of adapting a memoir by Elma Farnsworth into a <a href="biographical%20film">biopic</a>. The next year he completed the screenplay under the title "<a href="The%20Farnsworth%20Invention">The Farnsworth Invention</a>", and it was picked up by <a href="New%20Line%20Cinema">New Line Cinema</a> with <a href="Thomas%20Schlamme">Thomas Schlamme</a> signed on to direct. The story is about the patent battle between inventor Philo Farnsworth and RCA tycoon <a href="David%20Sarnoff">David Sarnoff</a> for the technology that allowed the first television transmissions in the United States.

At the same time, Sorkin was contacted by Jocelyn Clarke, the commissions manager of the <a href="Abbey%20Theatre">Abbey Theatre</a> in <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>, requesting he write a play for them, a commission which he accepted. In time Sorkin decided to tackle his commission by rewriting "The Farnsworth Invention" as a play. He delivered a first draft of the play to the Abbey Theatre in early 2005, and a production was purportedly planned for 2007 with <a href="La%20Jolla%20Playhouse">La Jolla Playhouse</a> in California deciding to stage a workshop production of the play in collaboration with the Abbey Theatre. But in 2006, the Abbey Theatre's new management pulled out of all involvement with "<a href="The%20Farnsworth%20Invention">The Farnsworth Invention</a>". Despite the setback, La Jolla Playhouse pushed on, with <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> lending his talents as producer. The production opened under La Jolla's signature <a href="La%20Jolla%20Playhouse%23Page%20To%20Stage">Page To Stage</a> program which allowed Sorkin and director Des McAnuff to develop the play from show to show according to audience reactions and feedback; the play ran at La Jolla Playhouse from February 20, 2007 through March 25, 2007. A production followed on Broadway, beginning in <a href="Preview%20%28theatre%29">previews</a> at the <a href="Music%20Box%20Theatre">Music Box Theatre</a> and scheduled to open on November 14, 2007; however, the play was delayed by the <a href="2007%20Broadway%20stagehand%20strike">2007 Broadway stagehand strike</a>. "The Farnsworth Invention" eventually opened at the Music Box Theatre on December 3, 2007 following the end of the strike; it closed on March 2, 2008.

In 2005, Sorkin revised his play "A Few Good Men" for a revival at the London <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End theatre</a>, <a href="Haymarket%20Theatre">the Haymarket</a>. The play opened at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in the fall of the same year and was directed by <a href="David%20Esbjornson">David Esbjornson</a>, with <a href="Rob%20Lowe">Rob Lowe</a> of "The West Wing" in the lead role.

In February 2016, it was revealed that Sorkin would be adapting <a href="Harper%20Lee">Harper Lee</a>'s "<a href="To%20Kill%20a%20Mockingbird">To Kill a Mockingbird</a>" for the stage, where he would be working alongside <a href="Bartlett%20Sher">Bartlett Sher</a>. His <a href="To%20Kill%20a%20Mockingbird%20%282018%20play%29">adaptation</a> opened on December 13, 2018 to acclaimed reviews at the <a href="Sam%20S.%20Schubert%20Theatre">Sam S. Schubert Theatre</a> on <a href="Broadway%20%28Manhattan%29">Broadway</a>.

Sorkin's return to film occurred when he was commissioned by <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal Pictures</a> to adapt "<a href="60%20Minutes">60 Minutes</a>" producer <a href="George%20Crile%20III">George Crile's</a> nonfiction book "" for <a href="Tom%20Hanks">Tom Hanks</a>' production company <a href="Playtone">Playtone</a>. "Charlie Wilson's War" is about the colorful Texas congressman <a href="Charlie%20Wilson%20%28Texas%20politician%29">Charlie Wilson</a> who funded the CIA's secret war against the former Soviet Union in Afghanistan. Sorkin completed the screenplay and the film was released in 2007 starring Tom Hanks, <a href="Julia%20Roberts">Julia Roberts</a> and <a href="Philip%20Seymour%20Hoffman">Philip Seymour Hoffman</a>, directed by <a href="Mike%20Nichols">Mike Nichols</a>.

In August 2008, Sorkin announced that he had agreed to write a script for Sony and producer <a href="Scott%20Rudin">Scott Rudin</a> about how <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> was founded. The film, "<a href="The%20Social%20Network">The Social Network</a>", based on Ben Mezrich's novel "<a href="The%20Accidental%20Billionaires">The Accidental Billionaires</a>", was <a href="film%20release">released</a> on October 1, 2010. Sorkin won the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Writing%20%28Adapted%20Screenplay%29">Academy</a>, <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Adapted%20Screenplay">BAFTA</a> and <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Screenplay">Golden Globe</a> Awards for "The Social Network". One year later, Sorkin received nominations for the same awards for co-writing the screenplay to the film "<a href="Moneyball%20%28film%29">Moneyball</a>".

In May 2012, Sony announced that Sorkin would write a movie based on <a href="Walter%20Isaacson">Walter Isaacson</a>'s biography of <a href="Steve%20Jobs">Steve Jobs</a>. Sorkin was a guest at the D10 conference in May 2012 and explained his thoughts at the time on the adaptation of Isaacson's biography:

"<a href="Steve%20Jobs%20%28film%29">Steve Jobs</a>", written by Sorkin, directed by <a href="Danny%20Boyle">Danny Boyle</a>, and starring <a href="Michael%20Fassbender">Michael Fassbender</a> as Jobs, was released in October 2015. On January 10, 2016, Sorkin won the <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Screenplay">Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay</a> for his work on this film.

Sorkin made his directorial debut with <a href="STX%20Entertainment">STX Entertainment</a>'s film "<a href="Molly%27s%20Game">Molly's Game</a>", based on poker entrepreneur <a href="Molly%20Bloom%20%28author%29">Molly Bloom</a>'s memoir. He also wrote the script for the film, which stars <a href="Jessica%20Chastain">Jessica Chastain</a> and <a href="Idris%20Elba">Idris Elba</a>. Production began in November 2016, and the film was released in December 2017.

It was announced in 2011 Sorkin would be returning to television with two <a href="HBO">HBO</a> projects. He has teamed with "<a href="The%20Office%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">The Office</a>" star <a href="John%20Krasinski">John Krasinski</a> to develop a miniseries about the <a href="Chateau%20Marmont%20Hotel">Chateau Marmont Hotel</a> based on "Life at the Marmont", a book by the hotel's co-owner Raymond R. Sarlot and Fred Basten. He also developed "<a href="The%20Newsroom%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">The Newsroom</a>", a series about a fictional cable news network. The series lasted three seasons, premiering on June 24, 2012, and concluding on December 14, 2014.

In March 2007 it was reported that Sorkin had signed on to write a musical adaptation of the hit 2002 record "<a href="Yoshimi%20Battles%20the%20Pink%20Robots">Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots</a>" by psychedelic-rock band <a href="The%20Flaming%20Lips">The Flaming Lips</a>, collaborating with director <a href="Des%20McAnuff">Des McAnuff</a> who had been developing the project.

On July 12, 2007, "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" reported that Sorkin had signed a deal with <a href="DreamWorks">DreamWorks</a> to write three scripts. The first script is titled <a href="Chicago%20Seven">"The Trial of the Chicago 7"</a>, which Sorkin was already developing with <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> and producers <a href="Walter%20Parkes">Walter Parkes</a> and <a href="Laurie%20MacDonald">Laurie MacDonald</a>. In March 2010, Sorkin's agent, <a href="Ari%20Emanuel">Ari Emanuel</a>, was reported as saying that the project was proving "tough to get together". However, in late July 2013, it was announced that Academy Award nominated director <a href="Paul%20Greengrass">Paul Greengrass</a> was in final talks to direct Sorkin's script and that <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> had previously been attached.

In August 2008 Des McAnuff announced that Sorkin had been commissioned by the <a href="Stratford%20Shakespeare%20Festival">Stratford Shakespeare Festival</a> to write an adaptation of <a href="Anton%20Chekhov">Chekhov's</a> "<a href="The%20Cherry%20Orchard">The Cherry Orchard</a>".

In 2010 Sorkin reportedly obtained the film rights to <a href="Andrew%20Young%20%28political%20operative%29">Andrew Young's</a> book "The Politician" (about Senator <a href="John%20Edwards">John Edwards</a>), and announced that he would make his debut as a film director while also adapting the book for the screen.

In November 2010, it was reported that Sorkin would be writing a musical based on the life of <a href="Harry%20Houdini">Houdini</a>, with music by <a href="Danny%20Elfman">Danny Elfman</a>. In January 2012, <a href="Stephen%20Schwartz%20%28composer%29">Stephen Schwartz</a> was reported to be writing the music and lyrics, with Sorkin making his debut as a librettist. The musical was expected to come out in 2013–14, with Sorkin saying, "The chance to collaborate with Stephen Schwartz, (the director) <a href="Jack%20O%27Brien%20%28director%29">Jack O'Brien</a>, and <a href="Hugh%20Jackman">Hugh Jackman</a> on a new Broadway musical is a huge gift." In January 2013, he dropped out of the project, citing film and TV commitments.

In September 2015, it was reported that Sorkin was writing a <a href="biopic">biopic</a> that will focus on the twenty-year marriage of <a href="Lucille%20Ball">Lucille Ball</a> and <a href="Desi%20Arnaz">Desi Arnaz</a> and their work together on "<a href="I%20Love%20Lucy">I Love Lucy</a>" and "<a href="The%20Lucy%E2%80%93Desi%20Comedy%20Hour">The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour</a>". <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Award</a>-winner <a href="Cate%20Blanchett">Cate Blanchett</a> is set to star as Ball, while the role of Arnaz is yet to be determined. Two years later, <a href="Amazon%20Studios">Amazon Studios</a> acquired the rights to the film.

In March 2016, it was announced that Sorkin would be adapting "A Few Good Men" for a live production on NBC, originally slated to air in 2017; however, "Sorkin is still mulling the project".

In August 2016, Sorkin launched a series of online screenwriting lessons through MasterClass. His lessons include dialogue, character development, story pacing, plot and his process of working. Students watch 35 short videos, download a PDF workbook, and share their observations and progress through discussion boards and social media groups.

Sorkin has written for the theatre, film and television, and in each medium his level of collaboration with other creators has varied. He began in theatre which involved a largely solitary writing process, then moved into film where he collaborated with director Rob Reiner and screenwriter William Goldman, and eventually worked in television where he collaborated very closely with director Thomas Schlamme for nearly a decade on the shows "Sports Night", "The West Wing" and "Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip"; he now moves between all three media. He has a habit of <a href="chain%20smoking">chain smoking</a> while he spends countless hours cooped up in his office plotting out his next scripts. He describes his writing process as physical because he will often stand up and speak the dialogue he is developing.

A "New York Times" article by Peter De Jonge explained that ""The West Wing" is never plotted out for more than a few weeks ahead and has no major story lines", which De Jonge believed was because "with characters who have no flaws, it is impossible to give them significant arcs". Sorkin has stated: "I seldom plan ahead, not because I don't think it's good to plan ahead, there just isn't time." Sorkin has also said, "As a writer, I don't like to answer questions until the very moment that I have to." The "<a href="Seattle%20Post-Intelligencer">Seattle Post-Intelligencer</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s TV critic John Levesque has commented that Sorkin's writing process "can make for ill-advised plot developments". Further complicating the matter, in television, Sorkin will have a hand in writing every episode, rarely letting other writers earn full credit on a script. Peter De Jonge has reported that ex-writers of "The West Wing" have claimed that "even by the spotlight-hogging standards of Hollywood, Sorkin has been exceptionally ungenerous in his sharing of writing credit". In a comment to "<a href="GQ%20%28magazine%29">GQ</a>" magazine in 2008, Sorkin said, "I'm helped by a staff of people who have great ideas, but the scripts aren't written by committee."

Sorkin's nearly decade-long collaboration in television with director <a href="Thomas%20Schlamme">Thomas Schlamme</a> began in early 1998 when they found they shared common creative ground on the soon to be produced "Sports Night". Their successful partnership in television is one in which Sorkin focuses on writing the scripts while Schlamme <a href="Executive%20producer%23Motion%20pictures%20and%20television">executive produces</a> and occasionally directs; they have worked together on "Sports Night", "The West Wing", and "Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip". Schlamme will create the look of the shows, work with the other directors, discuss the scripts with Sorkin as soon as they are turned in, make design and casting decisions, and attend the budget meetings; Sorkin tends to stick strictly to writing. In response to what he perceived as unfair criticism of "The Newsroom", Jacob Drum of "Digital Americana" wrote, "The essential truth that the critics miss is that "The Newsroom" is Sorkin being Sorkin as he always has been and always will be: one part pioneer; one part self-conscious romantic; two parts actual Lewis & Clark-style pioneer, trapping his way across an old, old idea of an America that can always stand to raise its game—but most importantly, spinning a good yarn while he does so."

Sorkin is known for writing memorable lines and fast-paced dialogue, such as "You can't handle the truth!" from "<a href="A%20Few%20Good%20Men%20%28play%29">A Few Good Men</a>" and the partly Latin tirade against God in "The West Wing" episode "<a href="Two%20Cathedrals">Two Cathedrals</a>". For television, one <a href="hallmark">hallmark</a> of Sorkin's <a href="writer%27s%20voice">writer's voice</a> is the repartee that his characters engage in as they small talk and banter about whimsical events taking place within an episode, and interject obscure popular culture references into conversation.

Although his scripts are lauded for being literate, Sorkin has been criticized for often turning in scripts that are <a href="supererogation">overwrought</a>. His mentor <a href="William%20Goldman">William Goldman</a> has commented that normally in visual media speeches are avoided, but that Sorkin has a talent for dialogue and gets away with breaking this rule.

Sorkin married Julia Bingham in 1996 and divorced in 2005, with his workaholic habits and drug abuse reported to be a partial cause. Sorkin and Bingham have one daughter, Roxy. Sorkin was a dependent cocaine user for many years and, after a highly publicized arrest in 2001, he received treatment in a drug diversion program.

For several years, he dated <a href="Kristin%20Chenoweth">Kristin Chenoweth</a>, who played <a href="Annabeth%20Schott">Annabeth Schott</a> on "<a href="The%20West%20Wing">The West Wing</a>" (though after Sorkin had left the show). He has also reportedly dated columnist <a href="Maureen%20Dowd">Maureen Dowd</a> and actress <a href="Kristin%20Davis">Kristin Davis</a>.

A consistent supporter of the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a>, Sorkin has made substantial political campaign contributions to candidates between 1999 and 2011, according to CampaignMoney.com. During the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202004">2004 US presidential election</a> campaign, the liberal advocacy group <a href="MoveOn">MoveOn</a>'s <a href="political%20action%20committee">political action committee</a> enlisted Sorkin and <a href="Rob%20Reiner">Rob Reiner</a> to create one of their anti-<a href="George%20W.%20Bush">Bush</a> <a href="campaign%20advertising">campaign advertisements</a>. In August 2008, Sorkin was involved in a <a href="Barack%20Obama%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202008">Generation Obama</a> event at the Fine Arts Theater in Beverly Hills, California, participating in a panel discussion subsequent to a screening of <a href="Frank%20Capra">Frank Capra</a>'s "<a href="Mr.%20Smith%20Goes%20to%20Washington">Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</a>". Despite this Sorkin does not consider himself a political activist: "I've met political activists, and they're for real. I've never marched anyplace or done anything that takes more effort than writing a check in terms of activism".

In 1987, Sorkin started using marijuana and cocaine. He has said that in cocaine he found a drug that gave him relief from certain nervous tensions he deals with on a regular basis. In 1995, he checked into rehab at the <a href="Hazelden%20Foundation">Hazelden Institute</a> in Minnesota, on the advice of his then girlfriend and soon to be wife Julia Bingham, to try to beat his addiction to cocaine. In 2001, Sorkin along with colleagues <a href="John%20Spencer%20%28actor%29">John Spencer</a> and <a href="Martin%20Sheen">Martin Sheen</a> received the Phoenix Rising Award for their personal victories over substance abuse. However, two months later on April 15, 2001, Sorkin was arrested when guards at a security checkpoint at the <a href="Burbank%20Airport">Burbank Airport</a> found <a href="Psilocybin%20mushroom">hallucinogenic mushrooms</a>, <a href="cannabis%20%28drug%29">marijuana</a>, and <a href="crack%20cocaine">crack cocaine</a> in his carry-on bag when a metal <a href="crack%20pipe">crack pipe</a> set off the gate's metal detector. He was ordered to a <a href="drug%20diversion%20program">drug diversion program</a>.

Sorkin continued working on "The West Wing" amidst his drug abuse. In his commencement speech for Syracuse University on May 13, 2012, Sorkin declared that he had not used cocaine for eleven years.

In 2016, after the election of <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a>, Sorkin wrote an open letter to his 15-year-old daughter Roxy and her mother Julia Sorkin.

Sorkin was the creator, writer and executive producer of the following shows.

USS Wisconsin (BB-64)

USS "Wisconsin" (BB-64) is an , the second ship of the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> to be named in honor of the U.S. state of <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>. She was built at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Naval%20Shipyard">Philadelphia Naval Shipyard</a> in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, Pennsylvania and <a href="ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 7 December 1943 (the second anniversary of the <a href="Attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor raid</a>), sponsored by the wife of Governor <a href="Walter%20Goodland">Walter Goodland</a> of Wisconsin.

During her career, "Wisconsin" served in the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific Theater</a> of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, where she shelled <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japanese</a> <a href="fortifications">fortifications</a> and screened United States <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s as they conducted <a href="airstrike">air raids</a> against enemy positions. During the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>, "Wisconsin" shelled <a href="North%20Korea">North Korea</a>n targets in support of <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> and <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a>n ground operations, after which she was <a href="ship%20decommissioning">decommissioned</a>. She was reactivated on 1 August 1986; after a modernization program, she participated in <a href="Operation%20Desert%20Storm">Operation Desert Storm</a> in January and February 1991.

"Wisconsin" was last decommissioned in September 1991 after a total of 14 years of active service in the fleet, and having earned a total of six <a href="service%20star">battle stars</a> for service in World War II and Korea, as well as a <a href="Navy%20Unit%20Commendation">Navy Unit Commendation</a> for service during the January/February 1991 <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a>. She currently functions as a museum ship operated by <a href="Nauticus%2C%20The%20National%20Maritime%20Center">Nauticus, The National Maritime Center</a> in <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a>. "Wisconsin" was stricken from the <a href="Naval%20Vessel%20Register">Naval Vessel Register</a> (NVR) 17 March 2006, and was donated for permanent use as a <a href="museum%20ship">museum ship</a>. On 15 April 2010, the City of Norfolk officially took over ownership of the ship.

"Wisconsin" was one of the "<a href="fast%20battleship">fast battleship</a>" designs planned in 1938 by the Preliminary Design Branch at the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Construction%20and%20Repair">Bureau of Construction and Repair</a>. She was the third of four completed ships of the of <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s. Her <a href="keel">keel</a> was laid down on 25 January 1941, at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Navy%20Yard">Philadelphia Navy Yard</a>. She was <a href="ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 7 December 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Goodland, wife of <a href="Walter%20Samuel%20Goodland">Walter S. Goodland</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Wisconsin">Governor of Wisconsin</a>, and <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> on 16 April 1944, with Captain <a href="Earl%20E.%20Stone">Earl E. Stone</a> in command.

"Wisconsin"s main battery consisted of nine <a href="16%26quot%3B/50%20caliber%20Mark%207%20gun">/50 cal Mark 7 gun</a>s, which could hurl armor-piercing shells some . The secondary battery consisted of 20 <a href="5%26quot%3B/38%20caliber%20gun">/38 cal gun</a>s in ten twin turrets, which could fire at targets up to away. With the advent of air power and the need to gain and maintain <a href="air%20superiority">air superiority</a> came a need to protect the growing fleet of allied aircraft carriers; to this end, "Wisconsin" was fitted with an array of <a href="Oerlikon%2020%20mm%20cannon">Oerlikon 20 mm</a> and <a href="Bofors%2040%20mm">Bofors 40 mm</a> <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft guns</a> to defend allied carriers from enemy airstrikes. When reactivated in 1986, "Wisconsin" had her 20 mm and 40 mm AA guns removed, and was outfitted with <a href="Phalanx%20CIWS">Phalanx CIWS</a> mounts for protection against enemy missiles and aircraft, and <a href="Armored%20Box%20Launcher">Armored Box Launcher</a>s and Quad Cell Launchers designed to fire <a href="Tomahawk%20missile">Tomahawk missile</a>s and <a href="Harpoon%20missile">Harpoon missile</a>s, respectively. "Wisconsin" and her sister ship "Missouri" were fitted with thicker traverse bulkhead armor, , compared to in the first two ships of her class, the "Iowa" and "New Jersey".

"Wisconsin" is numerically the highest numbered US battleship built. Although her keel was laid after the s, she was commissioned before the 's commissioning date. Thus, "Wisconsin"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s construction began after "Missouri"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s, and finished earlier. "Iowa" and "Wisconsin" were finally stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 17 March 2006, making them the last battleships on a navy list in the world.

After the ship's trials and initial training in the <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a>, "Wisconsin" departed <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a>, on 7 July 1944, bound for the <a href="British%20West%20Indies">British West Indies</a>. Following her <a href="shakedown%20cruise">shakedown cruise</a> (conducted out of <a href="Trinidad">Trinidad</a>) she returned to the builder's yard for alterations and repairs.

On 24 September 1944, "Wisconsin" sailed for the west coast, transiting the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a>, and reporting for duty with the <a href="United%20States%20Pacific%20Fleet">Pacific Fleet</a> on 2 October. The battleship later moved to Hawaiian waters for training exercises and then headed for the Western <a href="Caroline%20Islands">Caroline Islands</a>. Upon reaching the Caroline Island <a href="Ulithi">Ulithi</a> she joined <a href="Admiral">Admiral</a> <a href="William%20F.%20Halsey">William F. Halsey</a>'s <a href="United%20States%20Third%20Fleet">3rd Fleet</a> on 9 December.

Due to the length of time it took to build her, "Wisconsin" missed much of the initial thrust into Japanese-held territory, having arrived at a time when the reconquest of the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> was well underway. As a part of that movement, the planners had envisioned landings on the southwest coast of <a href="Mindoro">Mindoro</a>, south of <a href="Luzon">Luzon</a>. From that point, American forces could threaten Japanese shipping lanes through the <a href="South%20China%20Sea">South China Sea</a>. In preparation for the coming invasion of Mindoro, "Wisconsin" was assigned to protect the 3rd Fleet's <a href="Fast%20Carrier%20Task%20Force">Fast Carrier Task Force</a> (TF 38), as they conducted air raids at <a href="Manila">Manila</a> to soften up Japanese positions.

On 18 December, the ships of TF 38 unexpectedly found themselves in a fight for their lives when <a href="Typhoon%20Cobra%20%281944%29">Typhoon Cobra</a> overtook the force–seven fleet and six light carriers, eight battleships, 15 cruisers, and about 50 <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s–during their attempt to refuel at sea. At the time the ships were operating about east of Luzon in the <a href="Philippine%20Sea">Philippine Sea</a>. The carriers had just completed three days of heavy raids against Japanese airfields, suppressing enemy aircraft during the American <a href="amphibious%20assault">amphibious operations</a> against <a href="Mindoro">Mindoro</a> in the Philippines. The task force rendezvoused with <a href="Captain%20%28U.S.%20Navy%29">Captain</a> Jasper T. Acuff and his fueling group 17 December with the intention of refueling all ships in the task force and replacing lost aircraft. Although the sea had been growing rougher all day, the nearby cyclonic disturbance gave relatively little warning of its approach. On 18 December, the small but violent typhoon overtook the Task Force while many of the ships were attempting to refuel. Many of the ships were caught near the center of the storm and buffeted by extreme seas and hurricane-force winds. Three destroyers, , , and , capsized and sank with nearly all hands, while a cruiser, five aircraft carriers, and three destroyers suffered serious damage. Approximately 790 officers and men were lost or killed, with another 80 injured. Fires occurred in three carriers when planes broke loose in their hangars and some 146 planes on various ships were lost or damaged beyond economical repair by fires, impact damage, or by being swept overboard. "Wisconsin" reported two injured sailors as a result of the typhoon, but otherwise proved her seaworthiness as she escaped the storm unscathed.

"Wisconsin"s next operation was to assist with the occupation of Luzon. Bypassing the southern beaches, American amphibious forces went ashore at <a href="Lingayen%20Gulf">Lingayen Gulf</a>, the scene of initial Japanese assaults to take Luzon nearly three years before.

"Wisconsin", armed with heavy anti-aircraft batteries, performed escort duty for TF 38's fast carriers during air strikes against <a href="Taiwan">Formosa</a>, Luzon, and the <a href="Nansei%20Shoto">Nansei Shoto</a> to neutralize Japanese forces there and to cover the unfolding Allied Lingayen Gulf operations. Those strikes, lasting from 3–22 January 1945, included a thrust into the South China Sea, in the hope that major units of the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> could be drawn into battle.

"Wisconsin"s carrier group launched air strikes between <a href="Saigon">Saigon</a> and <a href="Camranh%20Bay">Camranh Bay</a>, <a href="French%20Indochina">French Indochina</a>, on 12 January, resulting in severe losses for the enemy. TF 38's warplanes sank 41 ships and heavily damaged docks, storage areas, and aircraft facilities. Formosa, already struck on 3–4 January, was raided again on 9 January 15 January, and 21 January. Throughout January "Wisconsin" shielded the carriers as they conducted air raids at Hong Kong, <a href="Guangzhou">Canton</a>, <a href="Hainan%20Island">Hainan Island</a>, the Canton <a href="oil%20refinery">oil refineries</a>, the Hong Kong Naval Station, and <a href="Okinawa">Okinawa</a>.

"Wisconsin" was assigned to the <a href="United%20States%20Fifth%20Fleet">5th Fleet</a> when Admiral <a href="Raymond%20A.%20Spruance">Raymond A. Spruance</a> relieved Admiral Halsey as Commander of the Fleet. She moved northward with the redesignated TF 58 as the carriers headed for the Tokyo area. On 16 February, the task force approached the Japanese coast under cover of adverse weather conditions and achieved complete tactical surprise. As a result, "Wisconsin" and the other ships shot down 322 enemy planes and destroyed 177 more on the ground. Japanese shipping, both naval and merchant, also suffered drastically, as did hangars and aircraft installations.

"Wisconsin" and the task force moved to <a href="Iwo%20Jima">Iwo Jima</a> on 17 February to provide direct support for the landings slated to take place on 19 February. They revisited Tokyo on 25 February and hit the island of <a href="Hachinohe%2C%20Aomori">Hachino</a> off the coast of <a href="Honsh%C5%AB">Honshū</a> the next day, resulting in heavy damage to ground facilities; additionally, American planes sank five small vessels and destroyed 158 planes.

"Wisconsin"s task force stood out of <a href="Ulithi">Ulithi</a> on 14 March bound for Japan. The mission of that group was to eliminate airborne resistance from the Japanese homeland to American forces off Okinawa. Enemy fleet units at <a href="Kure%2C%20Hiroshima">Kure</a> and <a href="Kobe">Kobe</a>, on southern Honshū, reeled under the impact of the explosive blows delivered by TF 58's airmen. On 18–19 March, from a point southwest of <a href="Ky%C5%ABsh%C5%AB">Kyūshū</a>, TF 58 hit enemy airfields on that island; unfortunately, allied anti-aircraft fire on 19 March failed to stop an attack on the carrier . That afternoon, "Wisconsin" and the task force retired from Kyūshū, screening the blazing and battered flattop, and shooting down 48 attackers.

On 24 March, "Wisconsin" trained her guns on targets ashore on <a href="Okinawa">Okinawa</a>. Together with the other battle-wagons of the task force, she pounded Japanese positions and installations in preparation for the landings. Japanese resistance, while fierce, was doomed to failure by dwindling numbers of aircraft and trained pilots.

While TF 58's planes were dealing with and her escorts, enemy aircraft attacked the American surface units. Combat air patrols (CAP) shot down 15 enemy planes, and ships' gunfire shot down another three, but not before one "<a href="kamikaze">kamikaze</a>" attack penetrated the CAP and screen to crash on the flight deck of the fleet carrier . On 11 April, the Japanese renewed their "kamikaze" attacks; and only drastic maneuvers and heavy barrages of gunfire saved the task force. Combat air patrols shot down 17 planes, and ships' gunfire shot down 12. The next day, 151 enemy aircraft attacked TF 58, but "Wisconsin", together with other units of the screens for the vital carriers, kept the "kamikaze" pilots at bay and destroyed them before they could reach their targets. Over the days that ensued, Japanese "kamikaze" attacks managed to crash into three carriers—, and —on successive days.

By 4 June, a typhoon was swirling through the Fleet. "Wisconsin" rode out the storm unscathed, but three cruisers, two carriers, and a destroyer suffered serious damage. Offensive operations were resumed on 8 June with a final aerial assault on Kyūshū. Japanese aerial response was virtually nonexistent; 29 planes were located and destroyed. On that day, one of "Wisconsin"s <a href="floatplane">floatplane</a>s landed and rescued a downed pilot from the carrier .

"Wisconsin" ultimately put into <a href="Leyte%20Gulf">Leyte Gulf</a> and dropped anchor there on 13 June for repairs and replenishment. Three weeks later, on 1 July, the battleship and her escorts sailed once more for Japanese home waters for carrier air strikes on the enemy's heartland. Nine days later, carrier planes from TF 38 destroyed 72 enemy aircraft on the ground and smashed industrial sites in the Tokyo area. "Wisconsin" and the other ships made no attempt whatsoever to conceal the location of their armada, due in large part to a weak Japanese response to their presence.

On 16 July, "Wisconsin" fired her guns at the <a href="steel%20mill">steel mill</a>s and <a href="oil%20refinery">oil refineries</a> at <a href="Muroran">Muroran</a>, Hokkaido. Two days later, she wrecked industrial facilities in the <a href="Hitachi%20Province">Hitachi Miro</a> area, on the coast of Honshū-, northeast of Tokyo itself. During that bombardment, British battleships of the <a href="British%20Pacific%20Fleet">British Pacific Fleet</a> contributed their heavy shellfire. By that point in the war, Allied warships such as "Wisconsin" were able to shell the Japanese homeland almost at will.

TF 38's planes subsequently blasted the Japanese naval base at <a href="United%20States%20Fleet%20Activities%20Yokosuka">Yokosuka</a>, and put the former fleet flagship <a href="Japanese%20battleship%20Nagato">"Nagato"</a> out of action, one of the two remaining Japanese battleships. Throughout July and into August, Admiral Halsey's airmen visited destruction upon the Japanese, the last instance being against Tokyo on 13 August. Two days later, the Japanese surrendered, ending World War II.

"Wisconsin", as part of the occupying force, arrived at Tokyo Bay on 5 September, three days after the formal surrender occurred on board the battleship . During "Wisconsin"s brief career in World War II, she had steamed since commissioning; had shot down three enemy planes; had claimed assists on four occasions; and had fueled her screening destroyers on some 250 occasions.

Shifting subsequently to <a href="Okinawa">Okinawa</a>, the battleship embarked homeward-bound GIs on 22 September 1945, as part of <a href="Operation%20Magic%20Carpet">Operation Magic Carpet</a> staged to bring soldiers, sailors, and marines home from the far-flung battlefronts of the Pacific. Departing Okinawa on 23 September, "Wisconsin" reached <a href="Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a> on 4 October, remaining there for five days before she pushed on for the west coast on the last leg of her state-side bound voyage. She reached San Francisco on 15 October.

Heading for the east coast of the United States soon after the start of the new year, 1946, "Wisconsin" transited the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a> from 11–13 January and reached <a href="Hampton%20Roads">Hampton Roads</a>, <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> on 18 January. Following a cruise south to <a href="Guant%C3%A1namo%20Bay">Guantánamo Bay</a>, Cuba, the battleship entered the <a href="Norfolk%20Naval%20Shipyard">Norfolk Naval Shipyard</a> for overhaul. After repairs and alterations that consumed the summer months, "Wisconsin" sailed for South American waters.

Over the weeks that ensued, the battleship visited <a href="Valpara%C3%ADso">Valparaíso</a>, Chile, from 1–6 November; <a href="Callao">Callao</a>, Peru, from 9–13 November; <a href="Balboa%2C%20Canal%20Zone">Balboa, Canal Zone</a>, from 16–20 November; and <a href="La%20Guaira%2C%20Venezuela">La Guaira, Venezuela</a>, from 22–26 November, before returning to Norfolk on 2 December 1946.

"Wisconsin" spent nearly all of 1947 as a training ship, taking naval reservists on two-week cruises throughout the year. Those voyages commenced at <a href="Bayonne%2C%20New%20Jersey">Bayonne, New Jersey</a>, and saw visits conducted at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and the Panama Canal Zone. While underway at sea, the ship would perform various drills and exercises before the cruise would end where it had started, at Bayonne. During June and July 1947, "Wisconsin" took <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a> midshipmen on cruises to northern European waters.

In January 1948, "Wisconsin" reported to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Norfolk for inactivation. Placed out of commission, in reserve on 1 July, "Wisconsin" was assigned to the Norfolk group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.

Her sojourn in "mothballs", however, was comparatively brief, due to the <a href="North%20Korea">North Korea</a>n <a href="Korean%20War">invasion of</a> <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a> in late June 1950. "Wisconsin" was recommissioned on 3 March 1951 with Captain Thomas Burrowes in command. After shakedown training, the revitalized battleship conducted two midshipmen training cruises, taking the officers-to-be to <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, Scotland; <a href="Lisbon%2C%20Portugal">Lisbon, Portugal</a>; <a href="City%20of%20Halifax">Halifax</a>, Nova Scotia; New York City; and <a href="Guant%C3%A1namo%20Bay">Guantánamo Bay</a>, Cuba, before she returned to Norfolk. While leaving New York, "Wisconsin" was accidentally grounded on mud flats in New York Harbor, but was freed on 23 August 1951 with no damage to the ship.

"Wisconsin" departed Norfolk on 25 October, bound for the Pacific. She transited the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a> on 29 October and reached <a href="Yokosuka%2C%20Japan">Yokosuka, Japan</a>, on 21 November. There, she relieved as <a href="flagship">flagship</a> for Vice Admiral H. M. Martin, Commander, <a href="United%20States%20Seventh%20Fleet">7th Fleet</a>.

On 26 November, with Vice Admiral Martin and Rear Admiral F.P. Denebrink, Commander, Service Force, Pacific, embarked, "Wisconsin" departed Yokosuka for Korean waters to support the fast carrier operations of TF 77. She left the company of the carrier force on 2 December and, screened by the destroyer , provided gunfire support for the <a href="Republic%20of%20Korea">Republic of Korea</a> (ROK) Corps in the <a href="Kasong">Kasong</a>-<a href="Kosong">Kosong</a> area. After disembarking Admiral Denebrink on 3 December at <a href="Gangneung">Kangnung</a>, the battleship resumed station on the Korean "bombline", providing gunfire support for the American 1st Marine Division. "Wisconsin"s shelling accounted for a tank, two gun emplacements, and a building. She continued her gunfire support task for the 1st Marine Division and 1st ROK Corps through 6 December, accounting for enemy bunkers, artillery positions, and troop concentrations. On one occasion during that time, the battleship received a request for call-fire support and provided three star-shells for the 1st ROK Corps, illuminating an enemy attack that was consequently repulsed with considerable enemy casualties.

After being relieved on the gunline by the <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a> on 6 December, "Wisconsin" briefly retired from gunfire support duties. She resumed them, however, in the Kasong-Kosong area on 11 December screened by the destroyer . The following day, 12 December, saw the <a href="helicopter">helicopter</a> embarkation on "Wisconsin" of Rear Admiral H. R. Thurber, Commander, Battleship Division 2 (BatDiv 2), as part of his inspection trip in the Far East.

"Wisconsin" continued her naval gunfire support duties on the "bombline," shelling enemy bunkers, command posts, artillery positions, and trench systems through 14 December. She departed the "bombline" on that day to render special gunfire support duties in the <a href="Kojo%2C%20North%20Korea">Kojo</a> area shelling coastal targets in support of United Nations (UN) troops ashore. That same day, "Wisconsin" returned to the Kasong-Kosong area. On 15 December, she disembarked Admiral Thurber by helicopter. The next day, "Wisconsin" departed Korean waters, heading for <a href="U.S.%20Fleet%20Activities%20Sasebo">Sasebo</a> to rearm.

Returning to the combat zone on 17 December, "Wisconsin" embarked United States Senator <a href="Homer%20S.%20Ferguson">Homer Ferguson</a> of <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a> on 18 December. That day, the battleship supported the 11th ROK invasion with night illumination fire that enabled the ROK troops to repulse a North Korean assault with heavy enemy casualties. Departing the "bombline" on 19 December, the battleship transferred Ferguson by helicopter to the carrier .

On 20 December, "Wisconsin" participated in a coordinated air-surface bombardment of <a href="Wonsan">Wonsan</a> to neutralize pre-selected targets in its area. The ship shifted its bombardment station to the western end of Wonsan harbor, hitting boats and small craft in the inner swept channel with her 5-inch (127mm) guns during the afternoon and helping forestall attempts to assault the friendly-held islands nearby. "Wisconsin" then made an anti-boat sweep to the north, firing her 5-inch batteries on suspected boat concentrations. She then provided gunfire support to UN troops operating at the "bombline" until 22 December, when she rejoined the carrier task force.

On 28 December, Cardinal <a href="Francis%20Spellman">Francis Spellman</a>, on a Korean tour over the Christmas holidays, helicoptered aboard the ship to celebrate Mass for the Catholic members of the crew. He left as he came, off <a href="Pohang">Pohang</a>. On New Year's Eve day "Wisconsin" put into Yokosuka.

"Wisconsin" departed that port on 8 January 1952 and returned to Korean waters. She reached <a href="Pusan">Pusan</a> the following day and entertained the <a href="President%20of%20South%20Korea">President of South Korea</a>, <a href="Syngman%20Rhee">Syngman Rhee</a>, and his wife, on 10 January. The couple received full military honors as they came on board, which Rhee reciprocated by awarding Vice Admiral Martin the ROK Order of the Military Merit.

"Wisconsin" returned to the "bombline" on 11 January, and over the ensuing days delivered heavy gunfire support for the 1st Marine Division and the 1st ROK Corps. As before, her primary targets were command posts, shelters, bunkers, troop concentrations and mortar positions. As before, she stood ready to deliver call-fire support as needed, shelling enemy troops in the open on 14 January at the request of the ROK 1st Corps.

Rearming once more at Sasebo, she shortly joined TF 77 off the coast of Korea and resumed support at the "bombline" on 23 January. Three days later, she shifted again to the Kojo region, to participate in a coordinated air and gun strike. That same day, the battleship returned to the "bombline" and shelled the command post and communications center for the 15th North Korean Division during call-fire missions for the 1st Marine Division.

Returning to Wonsan at the end of January, "Wisconsin" bombarded enemy guns at <a href="Hodo%20Pando">Hodo Pando</a> before she was rearmed at Sasebo. The battleship rejoined TF 77 on 2 February, and the next day blasted railway buildings and marshaling yards at Hodo Pando and Kojo before rejoining TF 77. After replenishment at Yokosuka a few days later, she returned to the Kosong area and resumed gunfire support. During that time, she destroyed railway bridges and a small shipyard while conducting call-fire missions on enemy command posts, bunkers, and personnel shelters, making numerous cuts on enemy trench lines in the process.

On 26 February, "Wisconsin" arrived at Pusan where Vice Admiral Shon, the ROK Chief of Naval Operations; United States Ambassador J.J. Muccio; and Rear Admiral Scott-Montcrief, <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, Commander, Task Group 95.12 (TG 95.12), visited the battleship. Departing that South Korean port the following day, "Wisconsin" reached Yokosuka on 2 March, and a week later she shifted to Sasebo to prepare to return to Korean waters.

"Wisconsin" arrived off <a href="Kimchaek">Songjin</a>, Korea on 15 March and concentrated her gunfire on enemy railway transport. Early that morning, she destroyed a communist troop train trapped outside a destroyed tunnel. That afternoon, she received the first direct hit in her history, when one of four shells from a North Korean 152mm gun battery struck the shield of a starboard 40 mm mount; although little material damage resulted, three men were injured. "Wisconsin" subsequently destroyed that battery with a full 16-inch (406 mm) salvo before continuing her mission. After lending a hand to support once more the 1st Marine Division with her heavy rifles, the battleship returned to Japan on 19 March.

Relieved as flagship of the 7th Fleet on 1 April by sister ship , "Wisconsin" departed Yokosuka, bound for the United States. "En route" home, she touched briefly at <a href="Guam">Guam</a>, where she took part in the successful test of the Navy's largest floating dry-dock on 4–5 April, the first ever to accommodate an . She continued her homeward-bound voyage via Pearl Harbor and arrived at <a href="Long%20Beach%2C%20California">Long Beach, California</a> on 19 April before continuing on for Norfolk.

On 9 June, "Wisconsin" resumed her role as a training ship, taking midshipmen to <a href="Greenock">Greenock</a>, Scotland; <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest, France</a>; and <a href="Guant%C3%A1namo%20Bay">Guantánamo Bay</a>, Cuba, before returning to Norfolk. She departed Hampton Roads on 25 August and participated in the <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Treaty%20Organization">NATO</a> exercise <a href="Operation%20Mainbrace">Operation Mainbrace</a>, which was held out of Greenock, Scotland. After her return to Norfolk, "Wisconsin" underwent an overhaul in the naval shipyard there. "Wisconsin" remained in the Atlantic fleet throughout 1952 and into 1953, training midshipmen and conducting exercises. After a month of routine maintenance "Wisconsin" departed Norfolk on 9 September 1953, bound for the Far East.

Sailing via the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a> to Japan, "Wisconsin" relieved as 7th Fleet flagship on 12 October. During the months that followed, "Wisconsin" visited the Japanese ports of <a href="Kobe">Kobe</a>, <a href="Sasebo%2C%20Nagasaki">Sasebo Navy Yard</a>, <a href="United%20States%20Fleet%20Activities%20Yokosuka">Yokosuka</a>, <a href="Otaru">Otaru</a>, and <a href="Nagasaki%2C%20Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a>. She spent Christmas at Hong Kong and was ultimately relieved of flagship duties on 1 April 1954 and returned to the United States soon thereafter, reaching Norfolk, via Long Beach and the Panama Canal, on 4 May.

Entering the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 11 June, "Wisconsin" underwent a brief overhaul and commenced a midshipman training cruise on 12 July. After revisiting Greenock, Brest, and Guantánamo Bay, the ship returned to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for repairs. Shortly thereafter, "Wisconsin" participated in Atlantic Fleet exercises as flagship for Commander, Second Fleet. Departing Norfolk in January 1955, "Wisconsin" took part in Operation Springboard, during which time she visited Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Then, upon returning to Norfolk, the battleship conducted another midshipman's cruise that summer, visiting Edinburgh; <a href="Copenhagen%2C%20Denmark">Copenhagen, Denmark</a>; and Guantánamo Bay before returning to the United States.

Upon completion of a major overhaul at the <a href="New%20York%20Naval%20Shipyard">New York Naval Shipyard</a>, "Wisconsin" headed south for refresher training in the <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a>, later taking part in another Springboard exercise. During that cruise, she again visited Port-au-Prince and added <a href="Tampico%2C%20Mexico">Tampico, Mexico</a>, and <a href="Cartagena%2C%20Colombia">Cartagena, Colombia</a>, to her list of ports of call. She returned to Norfolk on the last day of March 1955 for local operations. On 19 October, while operating in the <a href="East%20River">East River</a> in New York Harbor, "Wisconsin" was accidentally grounded. However, the ship was freed in about an hour without any serious damage.

Throughout April 1956 and into May, "Wisconsin" operated locally off the Virginia Capes. On 6 May, the battleship collided with the destroyer in a heavy fog; "Wisconsin" put into Norfolk with extensive damage to her <a href="Bow%20%28ship%29">bow</a>, and one week later entered dry dock at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. A novel experiment sped her repairs and enabled the ship to carry out her scheduled midshipman training cruise that summer. A 120-ton, 68 foot (21 m) section of the bow of "Wisconsin"'s incomplete sister ship was transported by barge, in one section, from <a href="Northrop%20Grumman%20Newport%20News">Newport News Shipbuilding</a> and Drydock Corporation of <a href="Newport%20News%2C%20Virginia">Newport News, Virginia</a>, across <a href="Hampton%20Roads">Hampton Roads</a> to the <a href="Norfolk%20Naval%20Shipyard">Norfolk Naval Shipyard</a>. Working around the clock, "Wisconsin"s ship's force and shipyard personnel completed the operation which grafted on the new bow in 16 days. On 28 June 1956, the ship was ready for sea.

"Wisconsin" resumed her midshipman training on 9 July 1956. That autumn, "Wisconsin" participated in Atlantic Fleet exercises off the coast of the Carolinas, returning to port on 8 November 1956. Entering the Norfolk Naval Shipyard a week later, the battleship underwent major repairs that were not finished until 2 January 1957.

After local operations off the Virginia capes on 3–4 January 1957 and from 9–11 January, "Wisconsin" departed Norfolk on 16 January, reporting to Commander, Fleet Training Group, at <a href="Guantanamo%20Bay%20Naval%20Base">Naval Station Guantánamo Bay</a>, Cuba. "Wisconsin" served as Admiral <a href="Henry%20Crommelin">Henry Crommelin</a>'s flagship during the ensuing shore bombardment practices and other exercises held off the isle of <a href="Culebra%2C%20Puerto%20Rico">Culebra, Puerto Rico</a>, from 2–4 February. Sailing for Norfolk upon completion of the training period, the battleship arrived on 7 February and resumed local operations off Norfolk. On 27 March, "Wisconsin" sailed for the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>, reaching <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> on 6 April, she pushed on that day to rendezvous with TF 60 in the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a> before reporting to <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> for the NATO Exercise Red Pivot.

Departing Xeros Bay on 14 April, she arrived at <a href="Naples">Naples</a> four days later, "Wisconsin" conducted exercises in the eastern Mediterranean. In the course of those operational training evolutions, she rescued a pilot and crewman who survived the crash of a plane from the aircraft carrier . "Wisconsin" reached <a href="Valencia%2C%20Spain">Valencia, Spain</a>, on 10 May and, three days later, entertained prominent civilian and military officials of the city.

Departing Valencia on 17 April, "Wisconsin" reached Norfolk on 27 May. En route, she was called upon to sink a <a href="Boeing%20KC-97%20Stratofreighter">Boeing KC-97F-55-BO Stratofreighter</a>, "51-0258", which had ditched in the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a> on 9 May, 550 km (343.8 mls) SE of the <a href="Azores%20Islands">Azores Islands</a> following a double engine failure, and subsequently floated for ten days.
On 27 May, Rear Admiral L.S. Parks relieved Rear Admiral Crommelin as Commander, BatDiv 2. Departing Norfolk on 19 June, the battleship, over the ensuing weeks, conducted a midshipman training cruise through the Panama Canal to South American waters, and reached Valparaiso on 3 July. Eight days later, the battleship headed back to the Panama Canal and the Atlantic.

After exercises at Guantánamo Bay and off Culebra, "Wisconsin" reached Norfolk on 5 August and conducted local operations that lasted into September. She then participated in <a href="Operation%20Strikeback">NATO exercises</a> which took her across the North Atlantic to the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a>.

"Wisconsin"s days as an active fleet unit were numbered, and she prepared to make her last cruise. On 4 November, she departed Norfolk with a large group of prominent guests on board. Reaching New York City on 6 November, the battleship disembarked her guests and, on 8 November, headed for Bayonne, New Jersey, to commence a pre-inactivation overhaul. She was placed out of commission at Bayonne on 8 March 1958, and joined the <a href="United%20States%20Navy%20reserve%20fleets">United States Navy reserve fleet</a> (better known as the "Mothball Fleet") there, leaving the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> without an active battleship for the first time since 1895. Subsequently, taken to the <a href="Philadelphia%20Naval%20Shipyard">Philadelphia Naval Shipyard</a>, "Wisconsin" remained there with her sister ship "Iowa" into the 1980s. While berthed in the Philadelphia Naval Yard, an electrical fire damaged the ship and left her as the "Iowa"-class battleship in the worst material condition prior to her 1980s reactivation.

As part of <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>'s <a href="Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Navy Secretary</a> <a href="John%20F.%20Lehman">John F. Lehman</a>'s effort to create a "<a href="600-ship%20Navy">600-ship Navy</a>," "Wisconsin" was reactivated 1 August 1986, a <a href="Pre-Commissioning%20Unit">Pre-Commissioning Unit</a> (PCU) crew established, and the ship moved under tow to the <a href="Avondale%20Shipyard">Avondale Shipyard</a> in <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, Louisiana, to commence pre-recommissioning workups. The battleship was then towed from the Avondale Shipyard and arrived at <a href="Ingalls%20Shipbuilding">Ingalls Shipbuilding</a> in <a href="Pascagoula%2C%20Mississippi">Pascagoula, Mississippi</a> on 2 January 1987 to receive weapons system upgrades for her modernization. During the modernization, "Wisconsin" had all of her remaining <a href="Oerlikon%2020%20mm%20cannon">20 mm Oerlikon</a> and <a href="Bofors%2040%20mm">40 mm Bofors</a> anti-aircraft guns removed, due to their ineffectiveness against modern <a href="Fighter%20aircraft">jet fighters</a> and enemy anti-ship missiles; additionally, the two gun mounts located at mid-ship and in the <a href="aft">aft</a> on the <a href="Port%20%28nautical%29">port</a> and <a href="starboard">starboard</a> side of the battleship were removed.
Over the next several months, the ship was upgraded with the most advanced weaponry available. Among the new weapon systems installed were four MK 141 quad cell launchers for 16 <a href="Harpoon%20missile">AGM-84 Harpoon</a> anti-ship missiles, eight <a href="Armored%20Box%20Launcher">Armored Box Launcher (ABL)</a> mounts for 32 <a href="BGM-109%20Tomahawk">BGM-109 Tomahawk</a> <a href="missile">missile</a>s, and a quartet of the United States Navy's <a href="Phalanx%20CIWS">Phalanx</a> <a href="Close-in%20weapon%20system">Close in Weapon System (CIWS) 20mm</a> <a href="Gatling%20gun">Gatling gun</a>s for defense against enemy <a href="anti-ship%20missile">anti-ship missile</a>s and enemy aircraft. "Wisconsin" also received eight <a href="RQ-2%20Pioneer">RQ-2 Pioneer</a> <a href="Unmanned%20Aerial%20Vehicle">Unmanned Aerial Vehicle</a>s, which are remotely controlled drones that replaced the helicopters previously used to spot for her nine guns. Also included in her modernization were upgrades to <a href="radar">radar</a> and <a href="fire%20control%20system">fire control system</a>s for her guns and missiles, and improved <a href="electronic%20warfare">electronic warfare</a> capabilities. Armed as such, "Wisconsin" was formally recommissioned on 22 October 1988 in <a href="Pascagoula%2C%20Mississippi">Pascagoula, Mississippi</a> under the command of Captain Jerry M. Blesch, USN. Assigned to the <a href="U.S.%20Fleet%20Forces%20Command">United States Atlantic Fleet</a>, she was subsequently homeported at <a href="Naval%20Station%20Norfolk">Naval Station Norfolk</a>, Virginia, where she became the centerpiece of her own surface action group (SAG), also referred to as a <a href="battleship%20battle%20group">battleship battle group</a> (BBBG).

During the renovation, pieces of the teak deck were removed and made into commemorative pieces, but they were not marked with an edition number indicating how many were actually created. A brass plaque with the ships name appears on the left and an inscription reading:

"Wisconsin" spent the first part of 1989 conducting training exercises in the Atlantic Ocean and off the coast of <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a> before returning to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for a post recommissioning shakedown that lasted the rest of the year. In mid-1990 the battleship participated in a fleet exercise.

On 2 August 1990, <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a> invaded <a href="Kuwait">Kuwait</a>. In the middle of the month, <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a>, in keeping with the <a href="Carter%20Doctrine">Carter Doctrine</a>, sent the first of several hundred thousand troops, along with a strong force of naval support to <a href="Saudi%20Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> and the Persian Gulf area to support a multi-national force in a standoff with Iraqi dictator <a href="Saddam%20Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>. On 7 August, "Wisconsin" and her battle group were ordered to deploy in defense of Kuwait for <a href="Operation%20Desert%20Shield">Operation Desert Shield</a>, and they arrived in the Persian Gulf on 23 August. On 15 January 1991, <a href="Operation%20Desert%20Storm">Operation Desert Storm</a> commenced operations, and "Wisconsin" found herself serving alongside her sister "Missouri", just as she had done in Korea forty years previously. Both "Wisconsin" and "Missouri" launched <a href="Tomahawk%20Missile">Tomahawk Missile</a> attacks against Iraq; they were among the first ships to fire cruise missiles during the 1991 Gulf War. "Wisconsin" served as the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) strike commander for the Persian Gulf, directing the sequence of launches that marked the opening of Operation Desert Storm and firing a total of 24 of her own TLAMs during the first two days of the campaign. "Wisconsin" also assumed the responsibility of the local anti-surface warfare coordinator for the Northern Persian Gulf Surface Action Group.

"Wisconsin", escorted by , relieved "Missouri" on 6 February, then answered her first combat call for gunfire support since March 1952. The most recently recommissioned battleship sent 11 shells across of space to destroy an Iraqi <a href="artillery">artillery</a> battery in southern Kuwait during a mission called in by <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">USMC</a> <a href="OV-10%20Bronco">OV-10 Bronco</a> aircraft. Using an <a href="RQ-2%20Pioneer">Unmanned Aerial Vehicle</a> (<a href="Unmanned%20aerial%20vehicle">UAV</a>) as a spotter in combat for the first time, "Wisconsin" pounded an Iraqi communications compound on 7 February. Her main guns lobbed 24 shells on Iraqi artillery sites, missile facilities, and electronic warfare sites along the coast. That evening she targeted naval sites with her guns, firing 50 rounds which severely damaged or sunk 15 Iraqi boats, and destroyed several piers at the Khawr al-Mufattah <a href="marina">marina</a>. In response to calls for fire support from US and coalition forces, "Wisconsin"s turrets boomed again on 9 February, blasting bunkers and artillery sites, and shelling Iraqi troop positions near <a href="Khafji">Khafji</a> after the Iraqis were ousted from the city by Saudi and <a href="Qatar">Qatar</a>i armor. On 21 February, one of "Wisconsin"s UAVs observed several trucks resupplying an Iraqi command post; in response, "Wisconsin" trained her guns on the complex, leveling or heavily damaging 10 of the buildings. "Wisconsin" and "Missouri" alternated positions on the gun line, using their guns to destroy enemy targets and soften defenses along the Kuwait coastline for a possible <a href="Amphibious%20warfare">amphibious assault</a>.

On the night of 23 February, "Missouri" and "Wisconsin" turned their big guns on Kuwait's <a href="Faylaka%20Island">Faylaka Island</a> to support the US-led coalition ground offensive to free Kuwait from the Iraqi occupation forces. The two ships were to conduct a <a href="feint">diversionary assault</a> aimed at convincing the Iraqi forces arrayed along the shores of Faylaka Island that Coalition forces were preparing to launch an amphibious invasion. As part of this attack, "Missouri" and "Wisconsin" were directed to shell known Iraqi defensive positions on the island. Shortly after "Missouri" completed her shelling of Faylaka Island, "Wisconsin", while still over the horizon (and thus out of visual range of the Iraqi forces) launched her RQ-2 Pioneer Unmanned Aerial Vehicle to spot for her guns. As "Wisconsin"s drone approached Faylaka Island, the pilot of the drone was instructed to fly the vehicle low over Iraqi positions so that the soldiers would know that they were once again being targeted by a battleship. Iraqi troops on the ground heard the Pioneer's distinctive buzzing sound, and having witnessed the effects of "Missouri"s artillery strike on their trench line, the Iraqi troops decided to signal their willingness to <a href="Surrender%20%28military%29">surrender</a> by waving makeshift <a href="white%20flag">white flag</a>s, an action dutifully noted aboard "Wisconsin". Amused at this sudden development, the men assigned to the drone's aircrew called "Wisconsin"s commanding officer, Captain <a href="David%20S.%20Bill%20III">David S. Bill III</a>, and asked, "Sir, they want to surrender, what should I do with them?" This surrender to "Wisconsin"s Pioneer has since become one of the most remembered moments of the Gulf War; the incident was also the first-ever surrender of enemy troops to an unmanned aircraft controlled by a ship. "Wisconsin" drone also carried out a number of reconnaissance missions on occupied Kuwait before the coalition's ground offensive.

The next day, "Wisconsin" answered two separate call fire support missions for coalition forces by suppressing Iraqi troops barricaded in a pair of bunkers. After witnessing the effects of "Wisconsin"s strike against the Iraqi positions an elated Saudi marine commander commented over the radio, "I wish we had a battleship in our navy."

Both "Wisconsin" and "Missouri" passed the million-pound mark of ordnance delivered on Iraqi targets by the time president George H. W. Bush ended hostilities on 28 February. With one last salvo from her big guns, "Wisconsin" fired the last naval gunfire support mission of the war, and thus was the final battleship in world history to see action. "Wisconsin" remained in the Persian Gulf after the cease-fire took effect, and returned home on 28 March 1991. During the eight months "Wisconsin" spent in the Persian Gulf, she had flown 348 UAV hours, recorded 661 safe helicopter landings, steamed , fired 319 rounds, 881 rounds, 5,200 20 mm Phalanx CIWS rounds., and launched 24 <a href="Tomahawk%20cruise%20missiles">Tomahawk cruise missiles</a>. Since all four remaining battleships were decommissioned and stricken following the Gulf War, this was the last time that United States battleships actively participated in a war.

With the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union%20%281985%E2%80%931991%29">collapse of the Soviet Union</a> in the early 1990s and the absence of a perceived threat to the United States came drastic cuts in the defense budget. The high cost of maintaining and operating battleships as part of the United States Navy's active fleet became uneconomical; as a result, "Wisconsin" was decommissioned on 30 September 1991 after 14 total years of active service, and joined the <a href="Reserve%20Fleet">Reserve Fleet</a> at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Naval%20Shipyard">Philadelphia Naval Shipyard</a>. She was stricken from the <a href="Naval%20Vessel%20Register">Naval Vessel Register</a> (NVR) on 12 January 1995, then on 15 October 1996, she was moved to the <a href="Norfolk%20Naval%20Shipyard">Norfolk Naval Shipyard</a>, and on 12 February 1998, she was restored to the Naval Vessel Register. On 7 December 2000, the battleship was towed from Portsmouth, Virginia and berthed adjacent to <a href="Nauticus%2C%20The%20National%20Maritime%20Center">Nauticus, The National Maritime Center</a> in Norfolk. On 16 April 2001 the battleship's weather decks were opened to the public by the <a href="Hampton%20Roads%20Naval%20Museum">Hampton Roads Naval Museum</a>, a U.S. Navy museum charged with "Wisconsin"s interpretation and public visitation. The ship was still owned by the Navy and was considered part of the <a href="reserve%20fleet">mothball fleet</a>.

"Wisconsin" was named (along with ) as one of two US Navy battleships to be maintained in the <a href="United%20States%20Navy%20reserve%20fleets">United States Navy reserve fleets</a> in accordance with the <a href="National%20Defense%20Authorization%20Act">National Defense Authorization Act</a> of 1996 as shore bombardment vessels. However, "Wisconsin" was then over 60 years old and would have required extensive modernization to return to the fleet since most of her technology dated back to World War II, and the missile and electronic warfare equipment added to the battleship during her 1988–89 modernization were considered obsolete. Furthermore, during the 1991 <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a>, she was said to be hindered by <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>i <a href="naval%20mines">naval mines</a>, and reports on the Internet suggest that the majority of the shore bombardments were successfully carried out by US s and their guns. In addition, the cost of modernizing the battleships was estimated to be around $500 million for reactivation and $1.5 billion for a full modernization program.

On 17 March 2006, the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a> exercised his authority to strike "Iowa" and "Wisconsin" from the NVR, which cleared the way for both ships to be donated for use as <a href="museum%20ship">museums</a>; however, the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> remained "deeply concerned" over the loss of naval surface gunfire support that the battleships provided, and noted that "...navy efforts to improve upon, much less replace, this capability have been highly problematic." Partially as a consequence, Congress passed , the National Defense Authorization Act 2006, requiring that the battleships be kept and maintained in a state of readiness should they ever be needed again. Congress had ordered that the following measures be implemented to ensure that "Wisconsin" could be returned to active duty if needed:
These four conditions closely mirror the original three conditions that the Nation Defense Authorization Act of 1996 laid out for the maintenance of "Wisconsin" while she was in the <a href="United%20States%20Navy%20reserve%20fleets">Mothball Fleet</a>. It was unlikely that these conditions would impede a plan to turn "Wisconsin" into a permanent museum ship at her berth in Norfolk.

On 14 December 2009 the US Navy officially transferred "Wisconsin" to the city of Norfolk, ending the requirement for the ship to be preserved for possible recall to active duty. The US Navy had paid the city of Norfolk $2.8 million between 2000 and 2009 to maintain the ship. A formal ceremony transferring the ship to the city of Norfolk took place on 16 April 2010. "Wisconsin" was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 28 March 2012.

"Wisconsin" earned five <a href="battle%20stars">battle stars</a> for her <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> service, and one for the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>. The ship also received the <a href="Combat%20Action%20Ribbon">Combat Action Ribbon</a> and <a href="Navy%20Unit%20Commendation">Navy Unit Commendation</a> for actions in the Korean War and Operation Desert Storm in 1991. She also received over a dozen more awards for World War II, the Korean War and Operations <a href="Operation%20Desert%20Shield">Desert Shield</a>/<a href="Desert%20Storm">Desert Storm</a>.

Star Trek III: The Search for Spock

Star Trek III: The Search for Spock is a 1984 American <a href="science%20fiction%20film">science fiction film</a> directed by <a href="Leonard%20Nimoy">Leonard Nimoy</a> and based on the created by <a href="Gene%20Roddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a>. It is the third film in the <a href="Star%20Trek%20%28film%20series%29">"Star Trek" film series</a>, and is the second part of a three-film <a href="story%20arc">story arc</a> that begins with "" (1982) and concludes with "" (1986). After the death of <a href="Spock">Spock</a> (Nimoy), the crew of the <a href="USS%20Enterprise%20%28NCC-1701%29">USS "Enterprise"</a> returns to Earth. When <a href="James%20T.%20Kirk">James T. Kirk</a> (<a href="William%20Shatner">William Shatner</a>) learns that Spock's spirit, or <a href="Vulcan%20%28Star%20Trek%29%23Katra">katra</a>, is held in the mind of Dr. <a href="Leonard%20McCoy">Leonard "Bones" McCoy</a> (<a href="DeForest%20Kelley">DeForest Kelley</a>), Kirk and company steal the "Enterprise" to return Spock's body to his homeworld. The crew must also contend with hostile <a href="Klingon">Klingon</a>s led by Kruge (<a href="Christopher%20Lloyd">Christopher Lloyd</a>) who are bent on stealing the secrets of a powerful <a href="terraforming">terraforming</a> device.

<a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> commissioned the film after the positive critical and commercial reaction to "The Wrath of Khan". Nimoy directed the film, becoming the first "Star Trek" cast member to do so. Producer <a href="Harve%20Bennett">Harve Bennett</a> wrote the script starting from the end and working back, and intended the destruction of the "Enterprise" to be a shocking development. Bennett and Nimoy collaborated with effects house <a href="Industrial%20Light%20%26amp%3B%20Magic">Industrial Light & Magic</a> to develop storyboards and new ship designs; ILM also handled the film's many special effects sequences. Aside from a single day of location shooting, all of the film's scenes were shot on Paramount and ILM soundstages. Composer <a href="James%20Horner">James Horner</a> returned to expand his themes from the previous film.

"The Search for Spock" opened on June 1, 1984. In its first week of release, the film grossed over $16 million from almost 2,000 theaters across North America. It went on to gross $76 million at the domestic box office, with a total of $87 million worldwide. Critical reaction to "The Search for Spock" was positive, but notably less so than the previous film. Reviewers generally praised the cast and characters, while criticism tended to focus on the plot; the special effects were conflictingly received. <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> called the film a compromise between the tones of the first and second "Star Trek" films. "The Search for Spock" has since been released on multiple home video formats, including <a href="VHS">VHS</a>, <a href="DVD">DVD</a>, and <a href="Blu-ray%20Disc">Blu-ray</a> high definition discs. Nimoy went on to direct "The Search for Spock"s sequel, "Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home".

The Federation <a href="Starship">Starship</a> <a href="USS%20Enterprise%20%28NCC-1701%29">"Enterprise"</a> returns to Earth following a with the superhuman <a href="Khan%20Noonien%20Singh">Khan Noonien Singh</a>, who tried to destroy the "Enterprise" by detonating an experimental <a href="terraforming">terraforming</a> device known as Genesis. The casualties of the fight include Admiral <a href="James%20T.%20Kirk">James T. Kirk</a>'s <a href="Vulcan%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Vulcan</a> friend, <a href="Spock">Spock</a>, whose casket was launched into space and eventually landed on the planet created by the Genesis Device. On arriving at <a href="Earth%20Spacedock">Earth Spacedock</a>, Doctor <a href="Leonard%20McCoy">Leonard McCoy</a> begins to act strangely and is detained. Commander-<a href="Starfleet">Starfleet</a>, Admiral Morrow visits the "Enterprise" and informs the crew the ship is to be decommissioned; the crew is instructed not to speak about Genesis due to political fallout over the device.

David Marcus (<a href="Merritt%20Butrick">Merritt Butrick</a>)—Kirk's son, a key scientist in Genesis's development—and Lieutenant <a href="Saavik">Saavik</a> (<a href="Robin%20Curtis">Robin Curtis</a>) are investigating the Genesis planet on board the science vessel "Grissom". Discovering an unexpected life form on the surface, Marcus and Saavik transport to the planet. They find that the Genesis Device has resurrected Spock in the form of a child, although his mind is not present. Marcus admits that he used unstable "protomatter" in the development of the Genesis Device, causing Spock to age rapidly and meaning the planet will be destroyed within hours. Meanwhile, Kruge (<a href="Christopher%20Lloyd">Christopher Lloyd</a>), the commander of a <a href="Klingon">Klingon</a> vessel, intercepts information about Genesis. Believing the device to be potentially useful as a weapon, he takes his <a href="Cloaking%20device">cloaked</a> ship to the Genesis planet, destroys the "Grissom", and searches the planet for the survivors.

Spock's father, <a href="Sarek">Sarek</a> (<a href="Mark%20Lenard">Mark Lenard</a>), confronts Kirk about his son's death. The pair learn that before he died, Spock transferred his "katra", or living spirit, to McCoy. Spock's "katra" and body are needed to lay him to rest on his homeworld, Vulcan, and without help, McCoy will die from carrying the "katra". Disobeying orders, Kirk and his officers spring McCoy from detention, disable the <a href="USS%20Excelsior%20%28Star%20Trek%29">USS "Excelsior"</a>, and steal the "Enterprise" from Spacedock to return to the Genesis planet to retrieve Spock's body.

On Genesis, the Klingons capture Marcus, Saavik and Spock and before Kruge can interrogate them their ship signals that the "Enterprise" has arrived and Kruge immediately beams back to the Bird of Prey.

In orbit, the undermanned "Enterprise" initially gains the upper hand in battle, but the Klingons return fire and disable the ship. In the standoff that follows, Kruge orders that one of the hostages on the surface be executed. Marcus is killed defending Saavik and Spock. Kirk and company feign surrender and activate the "Enterprise"s self-destruct sequence, killing the Klingon boarding party while the "Enterprise" crew transports to the planet's surface. Promising the secret of Genesis, Kirk lures Kruge to the planet and has him <a href="Transporter%20%28Star%20Trek%29">beam</a> his crew to the Klingon vessel. As the Genesis planet disintegrates, Kirk and Kruge engage in a fistfight; Kirk emerges victorious after kicking Kruge off a cliff into a <a href="lava%20flow">lava flow</a>. Kirk and his officers take control of the Klingon ship and head to Vulcan.

There, Spock's "katra" is reunited with his body in a dangerous procedure called "fal-tor-pan". The ceremony is successful and Spock is resurrected, alive and well, though his memories are fragmented. At Kirk's prompting, Spock remembers he called Kirk "Jim" and recognizes the crew. His friends joyfully gather around him.

<a href="William%20Shatner">William Shatner</a> reprises the role of Admiral <a href="James%20T.%20Kirk">James T. Kirk</a>, Starfleet officer. Shatner remarked that being directed by <a href="Leonard%20Nimoy">Leonard Nimoy</a>, his longtime co-star and friend, was initially awkward, although as the shoot went on, it became easier as Shatner realized how confident Nimoy was. To reduce weight, Shatner dieted before the start of production, but as filming continued, he tended to "slip"; the costume department had to make 12 shirts for him. In his book with <a href="Chris%20Kreski">Chris Kreski</a>, "Star Trek Movie Memories: The Inside Story of the Classic Movies", he believes that the scene where he learns of his son's death is "Kirk's finest celluloid moment ever".

Nimoy, in addition to his directing duties, appears towards the end of the film as <a href="Spock">Spock</a>, but only appears in the opening credits as the director. Nimoy found the most difficult scene to direct was one in which <a href="Leonard%20McCoy">Leonard McCoy</a> talks to the unconscious Spock in sickbay, en route to Vulcan. Nimoy recalled that not only was he in the scene, but his eyes are closed, making it difficult to judge the quality of the shot or the actor's performance: "It drove DeForest Kelley crazy. He swears that I was trying to direct him with the movement and flutter of my eyelids." Nimoy was thankful the story required him to appear in a minimal number of scenes. The rapidly aging Spock, at the ages of 9, 13, 17, and 25, was portrayed successively by <a href="Carl%20Steven">Carl Steven</a>, Vadia Potenza, <a href="Stephen%20Manley">Stephen Manley</a> and Joe W. Davis. <a href="Frank%20Welker">Frank Welker</a> provided Spock's screams, and Steve Blalock doubled for Nimoy, so that a total of seven actors contributed to the role.

<a href="DeForest%20Kelley">DeForest Kelley</a> returns as Leonard McCoy, doctor and the carrier of Spock's living spirit. Kelley has the majority of the film's memorable scenes, but admitted to occasional difficulties in acting with and being directed by his longtime co-star. However, he has declared that he had no doubts about Nimoy's ability to direct the film. Responding to suggestions that "Star Trek" copied "<a href="Star%20Wars">Star Wars</a>", Kelley asserted that the opposite was true. Playing the other crew members are <a href="James%20Doohan">James Doohan</a>, as <a href="Montgomery%20Scott">Montgomery Scott</a>, the chief engineer; <a href="George%20Takei">George Takei</a>, as <a href="Hikaru%20Sulu">Hikaru Sulu</a>, "Enterprise"s helmsman; <a href="Walter%20Koenig">Walter Koenig</a>, as <a href="Pavel%20Chekov">Pavel Chekov</a>, navigation and acting science officer; and <a href="Nichelle%20Nichols">Nichelle Nichols</a>, as <a href="Uhura">Uhura</a>, the ship's communications officer. Nichols had always insisted on wearing a skirt; although the standard female uniform used trousers, the costume designer created a skirted version specifically for her. Takei was dismayed to hear that his character was called "Tiny" by a guard at McCoy's cell during the film, and argued with the film's producer to have the line cut. When Takei saw the first screening of the film, he changed his mind and promptly apologized. He would later admit in his "" that "without that snipe from [the guard], the scene [where Sulu eventually beats up that same guard] would not have played even half as heroically for Sulu."

At age 87, and after an acting break of 14 years, <a href="Dame%20%28title%29">Dame</a> <a href="Judith%20Anderson">Judith Anderson</a> accepted the role of T'Lar—a Vulcan high priestess who restores Spock's katra to his body—at her nephew's urging. Nimoy wanted someone with "power and magic" for the ethereal role. Anderson claimed to be tall, but her true height was closer to , which presented a problem when the designers needed to make her look appropriately regal. The solution was to dress her with an overlong hem and built-up shoes which, combined with a crown, added to her height. <a href="Kirstie%20Alley">Kirstie Alley</a>, who had played Saavik in "The Wrath of Khan", did not return to reprise her role because she feared being typecast. <a href="Robin%20Curtis">Robin Curtis</a> had arrived in Los Angeles in 1982; she became friends with the head of Paramount's casting department, who recommended her for the role. Nimoy met with Curtis, and gave her the assignment the next day.

Nimoy had admired <a href="Christopher%20Lloyd">Christopher Lloyd</a>'s work in "<a href="One%20Flew%20Over%20the%20Cuckoo%27s%20Nest%20%28film%29">One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</a>" and "<a href="Taxi%20%28TV%20series%29">Taxi</a>", and was impressed by his ability to play powerful villains. Lloyd was given the role of Kruge, a <a href="Klingon">Klingon</a> interested in securing the powerful secrets of Genesis for use as a weapon. Nimoy said that Lloyd brought a welcome element of theatricality to the role. <a href="Mark%20Lenard">Mark Lenard</a> plays <a href="Sarek">Sarek</a>, Spock's father and a Vulcan ambassador. Lenard had previously played the role in the "" episode "<a href="Journey%20to%20Babel">Journey to Babel</a>" and the "" episode "". <a href="Merritt%20Butrick">Merritt Butrick</a> reprises his role as <a href="List%20of%20Star%20Trek%20characters%20%28G%E2%80%93M%29%23M">David Marcus</a>, Kirk's son and a scientist who had helped develop the Genesis Device, from "The Wrath of Khan".

Other roles include <a href="Robert%20Hooks">Robert Hooks</a> as Admiral Morrow, the commander of Starfleet; <a href="James%20Sikking">James Sikking</a> as Captain Styles, the <a href="commanding%20officer">commanding officer</a> of the "Excelsior"; <a href="Miguel%20Ferrer">Miguel Ferrer</a> as the "<nowiki>Excelsior'</nowiki>"s First Officer and Helmsman; and <a href="Phillip%20R.%20Allen">Phillip R. Allen</a> as Captain J.T. Esteban, the captain of the ill-fated "Grissom". <a href="John%20Larroquette">John Larroquette</a> plays Maltz, a member of Kruge's bridge crew whom Nimoy describes as "the thoughtful Klingon". <a href="Catherine%20Shirriff">Catherine Shirriff</a> plays Valkris, Kruge's doomed lover. <a href="Grace%20Lee%20Whitney">Grace Lee Whitney</a>, who played <a href="Janice%20Rand">Janice Rand</a> in the original "Star Trek" series, made a <a href="cameo%20appearance">cameo appearance</a> (wearing a wig) as "Woman in Cafeteria". <a href="Scott%20McGinnis">Scott McGinnis</a> plays a young man whom Uhura forces into a closet at gunpoint.

"" was a critical and commercial success, and <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> quickly prepared for a third "Star Trek" film. "The Wrath of Khan"s director, <a href="Nicholas%20Meyer">Nicholas Meyer</a>, would not return; he had disagreed with changes made to his film's ending without his consent. Upon seeing "The Wrath of Khan", <a href="Leonard%20Nimoy">Leonard Nimoy</a> became "excited" about playing Spock again. When asked by Paramount if he wanted to reprise the role for the third feature, Nimoy agreed and told them, "You're damned right, I want to direct that picture!" Studio chief <a href="Michael%20Eisner">Michael Eisner</a> was reluctant to hire Nimoy because he mistakenly believed that the actor hated "Star Trek" and had demanded in his contract that Spock be killed. Nimoy was given the job after he persuaded Eisner that this was not the case. "Star Trek" creator <a href="Gene%20Roddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a>'s first reaction to the news was that producer <a href="Harve%20Bennett">Harve Bennett</a> had "hired a director you can't fire".

Paramount gave Bennett the green light to write "Star Trek III" the day after "The Wrath of Khan" opened, the fastest go-ahead the producer had received. He began writing the screenplay, noting that "seventeen other people could have written [it]" after the hints at Spock's resurrection in the previous film. Bennett and Nimoy used the open thread of Spock mind melding with McCoy at the end of "The Wrath of Khan" as a way to explain Spock's restoration. The idea and name of the Vulcan "katra" came from Bennett's discussions with Nimoy. The actor referred the producer to an episode of the television series, "<a href="Amok%20Time">Amok Time</a>", that suggested to Bennett a high level of "spiritual transference" among the Vulcans. Bennett admitted that the idea of Kirk and company going back to the Genesis planet to recover Kirk's "noble self" stemmed from a poem he read in a "Star Trek" fan magazine. The film's production acknowledged certain expectations from fans—Nimoy remarked that if Spock had not been resurrected and, instead, "Captain Kirk turn[ed] to the camera and [said] 'Sorry, we didn't find him,' people would throw rocks at the screen." A major issue Bennett wrestled with was how to introduce the story for people who had not seen "The Wrath of Khan". Bennett said that his television producer mentality "won out"; he added a "previously in "Star Trek" ..." film device, and had Kirk narrate a <a href="logbook">captain's log</a>, describing his feelings and sense of loss. Aware of the story's predictability, Bennett decided to have the <a href="USS%20Enterprise%20%28NCC-1701%29">USS "Enterprise"</a> destroyed, and intended this plot element be kept a secret.

Nimoy wanted "The Search for Spock" to be "operatic" in scope; "I wanted the emotions to be very large, very broad, life and death themes [...] and the [look of the film] and everything about it derives everything from sizable characters playing out a large story on a large canvas," he said. In addition, he wanted the characters to have significant scenes, however small, that made them grounded and real. Bennett started writing the script with the ending, where Spock says, "Your name is... Jim", and worked backwards from that point. Elements such as Kruge killing his lover were added to establish context and add drama and intrigue. Originally, the <a href="Romulan">Romulan</a>s were the villains, but Nimoy preferred the more "theatrical" Klingons, feeling that their pursuit of Genesis was analogous to the Soviet race for nuclear weaponry. Bennett took the opportunity to flesh out the alien race, who he felt were ill-defined in the television series. The name of the class of the antagonists' ship, <a href="Klingon%20starships%23Bird%20of%20Prey%20classes">Bird of Prey</a>, remained unchanged.

The script was completed in six weeks. The production's estimated budget of $16 million was slightly larger than that of "The Wrath of Khan", but still much less than "" (1979). Since elements such as many sets and uniforms had been established, more money was available for special effects. Assistant producer <a href="Ralph%20Winter%20%28producer%29">Ralph Winter</a> described the extra money as a "toybox" that allowed more leeway and "fun" in planning the scope of the film.

Nimoy and Bennett worked with effects company <a href="Industrial%20Light%20%26amp%3B%20Magic">Industrial Light & Magic</a> (ILM) to produce special effects, models, and live-action scenes. ILM received a two-page story treatment in November 1982, titled "Return to Genesis". Production supervisor Warren Franklin said that the script they received in early 1983 was "one of the best scripts we read" out of the submissions that arrived weekly. Although ILM had provided the effects work for "The Wrath of Khan", they had only been approached after effects storyboards had been completed. For "The Search for Spock", ILM were brought in much earlier, meaning that visual effects supervisor <a href="Ken%20Ralston">Ken Ralston</a> and his team were involved from the planning stages. Nimoy credited this early involvement with increasing the amount of creative input into the film's design and execution.

It became apparent to ILM that "The Search for Spock"s script required more design and model work than had been necessary for "The Wrath of Khan". A merchant ship destroyed by Kruge early in the film was a <a href="Kitbashing">kitbash</a>—a design made of combined model pieces. Effects cameraman Don Dow reasoned that since the ship was destroyed so quickly it did not make sense to spend a large amount of time building it. The <a href="USS%20Grissom">USS "Grissom"</a> was named for astronaut <a href="Gus%20Grissom">Virgil "Gus" Grissom</a>; the same model would be used to depict other science vessels in the television series "".

The "Excelsior" was a new design that ILM felt was a better rendition of a <a href="United%20Federation%20of%20Planets">Federation</a> starship—sleeker and more modern than the "Enterprise". The art department created concept sketches to show to Paramount, and at an art director's urging model maker William George submitted another design, based on what he thought the "Enterprise" would look like if designed by the Japanese. Nimoy picked George's angular and simplified take for production. While in the film, the "Excelsior" is supposed to be larger than its predecessor, the physical model was smaller than the "Enterprise".

The Earth Spacedock was a design intended to expand the scope of "Star Trek". After approving a small three-dimensional <a href="maquette">maquette</a> of the final design, the effects team created an exterior Spacedock model measuring tall. Rather than painstakingly wiring thousands of small lights, ILM made the model out of clear Plexiglass and painted it; scratching off the finish created windows, and an inner core of neon lights illuminated the resulting holes. The inside of the dock was simulated by an additional model, long, with a removable center section. The interior illumination was generated by outside fiber optics and 2,000–5,000 watt lights.
Art directors Nilo Rodis and Dave Carson designed the <a href="Klingon%20starships%23Bird%20of%20Prey%20classes">Klingon Bird of Prey</a>, while George constructed the model. Nimoy wanted the ship to be reminiscent of an attacking bird, with movable wings that changed depending on whether the ship was in a cruising or attack posture. George took design cues from sketches of bodybuilders and football players, incorporating the starship equivalents of down-stretched, threatening arms and muscular shoulders, together with what looked like shoulder pads and a chin guard on the ship's outstretched neck. Although the stolen Romulan ship thread was cut from the film, the Bird of Prey design had incorporated elements of Romulan design. "It has some of the basic bird shape, but it's more ominous", Ralston said. A graphic bird design was integrated into the ship's underside.

To save money, many sets, particularly interiors, were <a href="redress">redress</a>es of existing sets. The "Enterprise" bridge was reconfigured to stand in for the "Grissom", with the chairs reupholstered and the central computer consoles moved to modify the floor plan. An Earth bar and the Klingon medical bay were redresses of the "Enterprise" sickbay. The Klingon bridge was a set that Nimoy appropriated from another production. Many blinking consoles were rented from a props company rather than being fabricated. The "Enterprise" bridge itself remained largely unchanged from its appearance in the previous films, though the floor was repainted from black to grey to make it photograph better. The most drastic change was made to Spock's quarters. Nimoy had felt the previous grey color scheme did not express a Vulcan style, and had it brightened with yellows and oranges.

Adding local color to the Klingon bridge was a ragged doglike creature the effects team derisively called "Fifi Rebozo". Ken Ralston thought that giving the Klingon captain a pet would add atmosphere, and sculpted a reptilian dog worked into the script as Kruge's mascot. The animal's hair was made from cheap wig clippings; creature supervisor David Sosalla sprayed the material with adhesive and laid clumps of the distressed fur onto the painted puppet body to make the animal appear "beat-up and moth-eaten". During filming, Sosalla and crew sprinkled the creature with water to make it look more unpleasant. The animal was a <a href="hand%20puppet">hand puppet</a>; Ralston operated the head and body by placing his arm into an opening on the creature's side while hidden inside Kruge's command chair. Three helpers operated cables that opened the animal's eyes and made it snarl; the creature's head was large enough for Ralston to fit his hand inside the spring-loaded jaw to operate it. Many of the animal's intended movements were minimized; the crew did not move its ears because it made the supposedly repulsive creature "cute". For the animal's demise during the Klingons' fight with the "Enterprise", an additional "dead" puppet was created, but Ralston used the "live" one for the scene instead.

Many of the props in "The Wrath of Khan" had been reused from "The Motion Picture", or scrounged from other productions, but for "The Search for Spock" Winter wanted to design uniquely "Star Trek" items. George and artist Phil Norwood collaborated on many of the prop designs, creating updated and sleeker versions of the original series communicators and <a href="List%20of%20weapons%20in%20Star%20Trek%23Phasers">phasers</a>. Many props were created out of wood and embellished with small pieces from model kits. While the Federation <a href="tricorder">tricorder</a> was created using a model race car body, the Klingon props were intended to look dirtier, with sharp surfaces that looked uncomfortable to carry. George was insistent on using the shapes and materials, rather than blinking lights, to suggest the props were real and manufactured.

<a href="Robert%20Fletcher%20%28costume%20designer%29">Robert Fletcher</a>, costume designer for the previous "Star Trek" films, was responsible for "The Search for Spock"s wardrobe. Fletcher's job was to sketch outfits, choose the necessary fabrics, and complete the fittings for principal characters. He collaborated with costumer Jim Linn, who clothed extras and managed the logistics of cleaning, repairing, and tracking costumes. Most of the <a href="Starfleet%20uniforms">Starfleet uniforms</a> had already been designed for the previous film, but Fletcher wanted to dress the main characters in civilian clothes. Fletcher developed a mythology behind each outfit; the stone ornaments on Sarek's robe, for instance, were intended to be representative of a Vulcan's level of consciousness. The costumer had the advantage of access to Paramount's store rooms, which contained literal tons of expensive fabrics.

The designer and production staff were satisfied with the feudal Japan-inspired Klingon costumes Fletcher made for "The Motion Picture", but they had to make new versions; of 12 original costumes, half had been destroyed during publicity tours. The remaining six were loaned out for an episode of "<a href="Mork%20%26amp%3B%20Mindy">Mork & Mindy</a>" and badly damaged; Fletcher spent three months salvaging what remained. Additions to established clothing included an officer's vest for Kruge, and jewelry.

In addition to his costume chores, Fletcher designed the Klingon and Vulcan makeup. Makeup artist <a href="Thomas%20R.%20Burman">Thomas R. Burman</a> suggested that Fletcher was asked to help because the studio neglected to contract the work out; Burman received a contract only three weeks before the start of photography. Burman's bid of $160,000 was much higher than Paramount's $50,000 budget, but he secured the job when his competitor dropped out close to the start of production. "It didn't come down to money in the end but to who could do it quickly [...] we had a [reputation] for working fast and doing quality work," Burman explained. Fletcher and Burman agreed that the cragged foreheads of the Klingons in "The Motion Picture" were too prominent, obscuring the individuals' faces. "It was just too cartoonish, and I didn't want a "Star Wars" look in [the] movie. There had never been a good marriage between the forehead appliance and the actor's faces. We tried to keep them in character rather than have these obtrusive things on their heads," Burman said. The resulting Klingon makeup took two hours to apply.

To guard against leaks that had prefigured Spock's death during production of "The Wrath of Khan", Paramount took precautions to secure the sets. Set designer Cameron Birnie noted that the production's security was highly unusual; sets were built out of sequence and the crew given only as many pages as they needed to fabricate each locale. Security guards checked the picture identification cards of production staff. Any mention of the production was removed from stationery and documents, and "Trois" (three, in French) was written as a code word. Offices and workshops were bereft of identifying signage, with doors double-locked for extra protection. "The Search for Spock"s scripts were chemically treated so that copies could be traced to the original; as a further <a href="canary%20trap">canary trap</a>, subtle changes in wording distinguished each copy. Nimoy's name never appeared on call sheets, and Spock was referred to in the script as "Nacluv" (Vulcan spelled backwards). Despite the precautions, word of the "Enterprise"s destruction leaked out before the film's release.

Principal photography commenced on August 15, 1983. All but two days of production were filmed on Paramount soundstages, by cinematographer Charles Correll. "The Search for Spock" was one of the first major feature films to use <a href="Eastman%20Kodak">Eastman</a> 5294, a color high speed negative <a href="film%20stock">film stock</a>. The film allowed Correll latitude in choosing a broad range of <a href="Film%20speed">exposure indexes</a>. Since "The Search for Spock" was shot with <a href="Anamorphic%20format">anamorphic</a> lenses and many theatergoers would see widescreen <a href="70%20mm%20film">70 mm prints</a>, Correll needed to produce a crisp <a href="depth%20of%20field">depth of field</a>, a difficult task on many sets. For scenes on the bridge, Correll pushed the exposure index above the Eastman recommendation to keep the image crisp at less than 50 <a href="foot-candle">foot-candle</a>s.

Many of "The Search for Spock"s dialogue sequences feature tight close-up shots. During Kirk and Sarek's mind meld, Nimoy chose cuts that focused on accentuating the dialogue; "Instead of watching people's faces, all you see is the mouth or the eyes and you have the tendency to hear better," Correll explained. Correll was unhappy that every scene save one was filmed on a soundstage. Feeling that recreating everything on set resulted in a fake look, the cinematographer suggested that Genesis be filmed on <a href="Kauai">Kauai</a> in Hawaii, and that <a href="Red%20Rock%20Canyon%20State%20Park%20%28California%29">Red Rock Canyon</a> stand in for Vulcan. The production did not have the money to shoot on location, meaning that Nimoy was preoccupied with making sure the various outdoor settings felt believable. While the various vessel exteriors were handled by ILM, Correll was responsible for the look of the interior sets. He preferred to treat these as actual locations inside the ships; although the sets' ceilings were designed to be removed so that lights could be rigged in the rafters, Correll used other lighting methods. In the Bird of Prey, he used fluorescent tubes to pick up the walls' metallic paints, and kept the set smoky to convey a dirty atmosphere.

Before McCoy is arrested by security, he attempts to charter a spaceflight to Genesis in a bar. The scene opens with two officers playing a <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>-era dogfight video game. The wireframe biplanes were created using black lines on clear paper printouts placed on an overlay cell. "It was really just a gag shot", effects artist Charlie Mullen explained, "the idea that people in the future would be playing an old war game." To accommodate the effect, Correll had to use a large amount of exposure without making the bar appear overlit. Much of the lighting was provided by tables rigged with fluorescent tubes to provide an effect different from other parts of the film. Correll could not add smoke to the scene to enhance the bar "feel", because the disturbed atmosphere would have made ILM's game hard to insert. The scene was intended to end in a barroom brawl when security tried to take McCoy into custody; Nimoy decided that "it didn't feel right" and there was not enough time or money to achieve the scene successfully.

The Genesis planet was produced via matte paintings and soundstages on Paramount lots under art director <a href="John%20Edward%20Chilberg%20II">John Edward Chilberg II</a>. Much of the planet occupied Stage 15, known as the <a href="Cecil%20B.%20DeMille">DeMille stage</a> in honor of the director's <a href="Crossing%20the%20Red%20Sea">Parting of the Red Sea</a> on the stage during filming of "<a href="The%20Ten%20Commandments%20%281956%20film%29">The Ten Commandments</a>" (1956). The space measured . The perceived boundaries of the scenes were extended via <a href="matte%20painting">matte painting</a>s created by Chris Evans, Frank Ordaz, and Michael Pangrazio. Because parts of the set had to literally collapse during the planet's destruction, the set was built off the ground and featured trapdoors and pyrotechnics in the floor. The hundreds of 10,000 watt lights in the rafters were covered in silk for day scenes to soften the light, and fitted with blue filters for night; dimmers eased the transition between periods. Since the doomed planet was no longer a paradise, the art director, Nimoy, Bennett and Correll considered constant changes to the colors on the scenes, but decided not to get "fancy photographically". While many of the scenes appeared lit with minimal light sources such as flickering fires, Correll tried to use as much light as possible. To get the fire to reflect on the actor's faces, Correll used a variety of tricks with normal lights; using natural fire would not have provided the required intensity.
A significant feature of the Genesis planet are the alien worms that rapidly evolve from microbes on Spock's coffin. The creatures start as small, slimy crawlers, then grow to lengths of . The small worms were created by injecting molten "Hot-Melt" vinyl into <a href="epoxy">epoxy</a> polymer molds that were immediately put into cold water to create a translucent product. The resulting hundred or so creatures were painted and coated with methacyl, a slippery, slimy coating. Each worm was attached to an elevated platform by a piece of fishing line; the lines were tied to rods underneath the set. Offscreen helpers pushed the rods or pulled fishing line to create motion; the scene required many takes because the fishing line would periodically flash at the camera. The larger worms proved more problematic, with filming taking place at ILM and Paramount Stage 15. Similar to "The Wrath of Khan"s parasitic <a href="List%20of%20Star%20Trek%20animals%23Ceti%20eel">Ceti eels</a>, the worms featured cobra-like cowls and a ringed mouth of teeth. ILM built one of the worms with more articulation than the others; Ralston operated the creature through a hole in the set floor with his hand stuck inside the creature. The other worms were animated using <a href="pneumatic%20bladder">pneumatic bladder</a>s that caused air to pass through hoses in sequence, creating an undulating motion. During the scene, the worms attack Kruge, who kills one of them. The usual method for achieving the effect of the creature wrapping itself around Kruge would have been to film the sequence in reverse, but this posed problems: the slime coating Kruge would have been out of place with reverse filming, and multiple takes would ruin the Klingon makeup Lloyd wore. ILM's solution involved rigging the worm with fishing lines that were pulled in a choreographed fashion by multiple off-screen helpers to simulate the wrapping movement. When small pieces of the Klingon uniforms caught or snapped the fishing lines, Ralston resorted to steel cables.

The fiery breakup of the Genesis planet involved fire, smoke, and earth upheaval. "The main part of the floor was rigged so that rocks would shoot up out of the ground [on catapults]. Trees were rigged to fall and start fires," Correll explained. Producing the shots required meticulous direction and between 20 and 30 helpers were on hand the day of shooting. Correll shot simultaneously on nine cameras; the hope was to get as many usable shots as possible in one take, in case all the trapdoors and pyrotechnics had to be reset for another round of filming. This entire sequence was completed in three weeks.

The Vulcan stairs were filmed at <a href="Occidental%20College">Occidental College</a>—the production's only location shooting. To create the orange atmosphere, Correll used a large floodlight, created for the 1983 <a href="Peter%20Hyams">Peter Hyams</a> film "<a href="The%20Star%20Chamber">The Star Chamber</a>", placed on the top of a crane. The location's blue-grey sky was replaced with a matte painting that covered the top half of the stairs shot. Many ornamental touches Nimoy wanted for the procession scene ultimately never materialized. The background of the set was simply a painted piece of canvas; Nimoy had the background out of focus in all the shots as a way to hide the shortcomings of the scenery. Elements removed from the Vulcan sequence included a procession through the "Vulcan Hall of Ancient Thought", a space dominated by large heads atop columns and a sculpture towering to a height of . The scene was cut because the procession dragged on for too long.

Production on the film was temporarily shut down after a fire destroyed several soundstages at Paramount Studios, one of which was adjacent to the set for the Genesis planet. Initially, the set's pyrotechnics were suspected of causing the fire, but the cause was ruled to be arson. Shatner was among the cast members who grabbed fire hoses to stop the flames. Correll hoped the place would burn down so that he would get his chance to film in Hawaii. While most of the set was undamaged, holes in the side of the building had to be covered with heavy black curtains to prevent outside light from leaking in.

As with previous "Star Trek" films, time and money were major constraints for special effects. The effects artists were concerned about producing the right look no matter the time involved. While effects cameraman <a href="Scott%20Farrar">Scott Farrar</a> and his assistants constantly traversed the separating ILM from Paramount, teams at the effects house organized post-production effects and photography. The constant travel took a toll on Ralston, who began to forget which airlines he was taking and what city he was in. As a pause in work meant wasted time, effects editors Bill Kimberlin and Jay Ignaszewski produced usable effects shots for the live-action editors at Paramount; these half-finished, monochromatic composites gave the editors an idea of scene pacing. ILM contributed 120 shots to the film. Like Correll, Ralston used Eastman 94 for all shots that did not require <a href="Chroma%20key">bluescreen</a>.

ILM filmed starships using <a href="motion%20control">motion control</a> for timed and computer-assisted model movement. The ship models required multiple camera passes because different parts of the ship and its lights were filmed at different exposure levels. The "Excelsior" required eight passes to supplement the main "beauty pass", the "Enterprise" six. ILM could have combined passes with multiple exposures, but not without risk; "If anything got out of synch, or somehow we dropped a frame, we would have to reshoot—and then you're stuck. You've ruined two pieces, two elements," Farrar said.

The Klingon Bird of Prey's <a href="cloaking%20device">cloaking device</a> required a new effect. The original concept featured the layers of the ship forming up from the inside out, requiring a series of overlaid elements filmed with an Oxberry animation camera. ILM decided the effect appeared too "animated-looking", and defied common sense: "if there was a fanfare to decloaking, everyone would know the Klingons were coming and blow them out of the sky before they could even finish materializing," Ralston said. The supervisor decided on subtlety, throwing <a href="Color%20printing%23Color%20separation%20process">color separations</a> out of sync to create a blurry ripple effect. While simple, the sequence was more effective than the elaborate planned scene. Effects such as the destruction of the merchant ship were created using projected explosions, a technique perfected during the production of "<a href="Return%20of%20the%20Jedi">Return of the Jedi</a>". Simulated zero-gravity explosions were filmed and reflected onto a card using the same motion control program used for the models. The result was an explosion that moved with the model.

The most laborious effects sequences took place inside Spacedock; months were spent completing the station's interior shots. The effects crew tested different looks to make sure the dock interior seemed appropriately vast. "We found the interior demanded some degree of atmospheric haze, even though there probably wouldn't be any in space," Farrar said. To create a slightly degraded look, the crew used blue <a href="color%20gel">color gel</a>s for lights and shot through smoke for <a href="Fill%20light">fill</a> shots. They switched to diffusion filters for light passes, as using smoke for longer shots would have required time-consuming smoke level monitoring. Due to difference in the scales of the dock and ship models, it was impossible to film the "Excelsior" and "Enterprise" inside the set. Opening the dock's space doors was problematic because the lights illuminating the inside of the dock from the exterior had to be hidden from the camera to prevent <a href="lens%20flare">lens flare</a>s. Massive fans were used to keep equipment cool and prevent the lights from melting or warping the dock's interior artwork. The realism of the dock scenes was heightened by live action footage of a cafeteria, with windows overlooking the dock interior. The cafeteria was a set built at ILM and filled with 40 extras in front of a bluescreen so that the dock and "Enterprise" could be composited in later; matte paintings extended the ceiling of the set.
Ralston, who considered the "Enterprise" ugly and the model hard to shoot, delighted in destroying the ship. Several shots were combined together for the complete destruction sequence; while Ralston would have preferred to take a mallet to the original $150,000 model, a variety of cheaper models were used. The first part of the ship to be destroyed was the bridge, a separate miniature with stars added to the background. The shot switches to the Bird of Prey moving away as the top of the saucer burns, where explosions (filmed upside down to simulate the absence of gravity) were superimposed over a motion control pass of the ship. The camera cuts to a closeup of the ship's registration number being eaten away by inner explosions. George created a light Styrofoam model that was dissolved by <a href="acetone">acetone</a> dripped on the saucer from above. By shooting at less than one frame per second and keeping light off the model, the drips were not visible in the print. Burning steel wool on the inside of the saucer created a glowing ember effect from the ship's inner decks being destroyed. The saucer explosion was simulated by blowing up a <a href="Baby%20powder">talcum powder</a>-covered plaster dish. Two- and four-ounce bombs and gasoline were used as pyrotechnics in live action scenes of the bridge being destroyed. Stuntmen used spring-loaded platforms to launch themselves in the air.

For the final destruction of the Genesis planet, footage from the Paramount set had to be carefully matched with ILM effects footage. ILM built scale miniatures cut into sections to portray parts of Genesis' upheaval (rock slides, fissures opening in the ground) that live-action scenes could not easily replicate. One of the largest miniatures, measuring , had trick trees and trapdoors that could be reset, propane jets for gusts of fire, and <a href="solenoid">solenoid</a>-triggered rockfalls. For scenes where Kirk and Kruge battle at a precipice over a pit of lava, the shot combined animated lava, clouds (really cotton daubs on black), lightning, and a matte painting. Overhead shots of the lava were created by lighting a piece of clear Plexiglass with colored gels and covering the plate with methacyl, <a href="vermiculite">vermiculite</a> and charcoal; the mixture dripped off the surface and coated the crew underneath. ILM simulated Kruge's demise, a long plunge into the pool of lava, with the help of a stop-motion puppet. Lloyd fell a few feet onto a black mattress; during a lightning flash the actor was replaced by the puppet that fell the rest of the distance. Because the shot was filmed on black instead of the traditional bluescreen, the animators had to remove or <a href="Rotoscoping">rotoscope</a> the black background around Lloyd one frame at a time. The transition between the footage of Lloyd and the puppet was hidden by a single-frame flash as a bolt of lightning struck Kruge. The scene of Kirk and Spock beaming away as the ground collapses was another created at ILM, as the level of destruction was simply not possible for the live action crew.

Among the other effects ILM had to produce were the transporter beam and the warp speed effect. Mullen noted that the effects' look changed depending on who was directing the film; "everyone wants something distinctive, but nobody wants to get far enough away from the TV series to startle the <a href="Trekkie">Trekkie</a>s". The effect was produced by cutting out or <a href="Rotoscoping">rotomatting</a> the individual to be transported, then making a vertical slot through which a high-intensity light was positioned. A computer-controlled move would cause the light to spread from the center and fade away, then reset its position and repeat the movement on the opposite side. Handmade acetate filters and gels were applied to give the transporter beam color and patterns, followed by small flickering animated highlights called "bugs" which appeared after the character had dematerialized. The Klingons' transporters were given a harsh red look to differentiate them from the smooth blue Federation effect. Whereas many of the multicolored rainbow warp trail shots from "The Wrath of Khan" were stock footage taken from the first film, the producers of the third film wanted something new. A streak effect, in which a beauty pass of the ship was combined with blurred passes for each light intensity, was tried first. The result was disappointing; as the "Enterprise" grew larger the streaks became distorted and out of place. Mullen rejected a straight animation of the warp drive as too bouncy, but the footage was cut in for editing while ILM went through six more approaches to the problem. The final effect, a "vaporous, colorful trail", came together only weeks before the film's release.

Composer <a href="James%20Horner">James Horner</a> returned to score "The Search for Spock", fulfilling a promise he had made to Bennett on "The Wrath of Khan". While Nimoy considered hiring his friend <a href="Leonard%20Rosenman">Leonard Rosenman</a> for the score, he was persuaded that Horner's return would grant continuity between "The Wrath of Khan" and the new film. Much like the content of the film, Horner's music was a direct continuation of the score he wrote for the previous film. When writing music for "The Wrath of Khan", Horner was aware he would reuse certain cues for an impending sequel; two major themes he reworked were for Genesis and Spock. While the Genesis theme supplants the title music Horner wrote for "The Wrath of Khan", the end credits were quoted "almost verbatim".

In hours-long discussions with Bennett and Nimoy, Horner agreed with the director that the "romantic and more sensitive" cues were more important than the "bombastic" ones. Horner had written Spock's theme to give the character more dimension: "By putting a theme over Spock, it warms him and he becomes three-dimensional rather than a collection of schticks," he said. The theme was expanded in "The Search for Spock" to represent the ancient alien mysticism and culture of Spock and Vulcan.

Among the new cues Horner wrote was a "percussive and atonal" theme for the Klingons which is represented heavily in the film. <a href="Jeff%20Bond">Jeff Bond</a> described the cue as a compromise between music from Horner's earlier film "<a href="Wolfen%20%28film%29">Wolfen</a>", Khan's motif from "The Wrath of Khan", and <a href="Jerry%20Goldsmith">Jerry Goldsmith</a>'s Klingon music from "The Motion Picture". Horner also adapted music from <a href="Sergei%20Prokofiev">Sergei Prokofiev</a>'s "<a href="Romeo%20and%20Juliet%20%28Prokofiev%29">Romeo and Juliet</a>" for part of the "Enterprise" theft sequence and its destruction, while the scoring to Spock's resurrection on Vulcan was lifted from Horner's "<a href="Brainstorm%20%281983%20film%29">Brainstorm</a>" ending.

Nimoy wrote that "The Search for Spock"s major theme is that of friendship. "What should a person do to help a friend? How deeply should a friendship commitment go? ... And what sacrifices, what obstacles, will these people endure? That's the emotion line of the film [and] its reason for existence," he recalled. While Spock's bodily resurrection was complete, his mind was a blank slate—"The Search for Spock", Michele and Duncan Barrett argue, says that the important question is whether an individual's "mind" functions, as this is the key to a meaningful existence.

<a href="Brown%20University">Brown University</a> professor Ross S. Kraemer argues that "The Search for Spock" "became "Star Trek"s first and most obvious exploration of Christian themes of sacrificial, salvific death and resurrection". According to Larry J. Kreitzer, "The Wrath of Khan" provided "its own versions of Good Friday and a hint of the Easter Sunday to come", with the hints fulfilled by Spock's bodily restoration in "The Search for Spock". David and Saavik's discovery of Spock's empty coffin and burial robes parallels the evidence the <a href="Apostle%20%28Christian%29">Apostles</a> found that pointed to Jesus' resurrection in the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Luke">Gospel of Luke</a>, asserts Kraemer. Spock's resurrection not only proves the Vulcan's belief in the existence of the katra, but also affirms these are not just a belief system but a certainty. Barrett points to the "Star Trek" feature films in general and "The Search for Spock" in particular as a turn away from the irreligious television series. In more practical terms, Jeffery A. Smith pointed to "The Search for Spock" as one of many Hollywood films culminating in a 1990s trend where death has little permanence ("<a href="Ghost%20%281990%20film%29">Ghost</a>", "<a href="Defending%20Your%20Life">Defending Your Life</a>", "<a href="What%20Dreams%20May%20Come%20%28film%29">What Dreams May Come</a>", "<a href="Meet%20Joe%20Black">Meet Joe Black</a>").

The Genesis planet became a doomed experiment partly for dramatic reasons; having a time limit for the characters to save Spock added tension. Nimoy was also interested in scientific ethics—how quickly can science move and what are the dangers of that movement. University of Houston professor Dr. John Hansen notes that while Spock's sacrifice in "The Wrath of Khan" is the "archetype of reason and rationality manifesting the archetype of human virtue", a selfless and freely-made choice, the death of Valkris (who has learned too much about the Genesis Device) in "The Search for Spock" is far different: the Klingon willingly accepts her death for the "common good" as determined by the state, relinquishing her liberty and life. Hansen contends that the issues of personal liberty and the exploitation of technology, in this case Genesis, are "intertwined". The Genesis Device was intended as a liberating technology, creating life from lifelessness, but in the Klingon view it is a tool for dominion (contrasting the contemporary views of how technology can promote or constrain liberty).

"The Search for Spock" was not heavily marketed. Among the promotional merchandise created for the film's release were "Search for Spock"-branded calendars and glasses sold at <a href="Taco%20Bell">Taco Bell</a>. A novelization () was also released, and reached second place on "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" paperback bestsellers list. President <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> screened the film for friends during a weekend away from the White House in 1984, spent with White House staff chief Mike Deaver and the president's own close friend Senator <a href="Paul%20Laxalt">Paul Laxalt</a>. Reagan wrote of the film: "It wasn't too good."

"The Search for Spock" opened June 1 in a record-breaking 1,996 theaters across North America; with competing films "<a href="Indiana%20Jones%20and%20the%20Temple%20of%20Doom">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</a>", "<a href="Gremlins">Gremlins</a>", "<a href="Ghostbusters">Ghostbusters</a>" and "<a href="Top%20Secret%21">Top Secret!</a>" released at the same time, more than half of the nation's screens were filled by summer blockbusters. "The Search for Spock" grossed over $16 million in its opening weekend. In its second weekend the film's gross dropped 42 percent. The box office strength of "The Search for Spock" and "Indiana Jones" led Paramount to dominate early summer film business. The film made $76.5 million in North America, for a total of $87 million worldwide.

<a href="James%20Horner">James Horner</a>'s soundtrack to the film was released on a 43-minute <a href="LP%20record">LP record</a> by <a href="Capitol%20Records">Capitol Records</a> in 1984, and also contained a 12" single titled "The Search for Spock", composed by Horner and performed by Group 87, a band featuring composer <a href="Mark%20Isham">Mark Isham</a> and <a href="Missing%20Persons%20%28band%29">Missing Persons</a> drummer <a href="Terry%20Bozzio">Terry Bozzio</a>. It was re-released on <a href="compact%20disc">compact disc</a> in 1989 by <a href="GNP%20Crescendo">GNP Crescendo</a>. Film Score Monthly released an expanded two-compact disc score June 1, 2010. The Expanded Edition included both the original <a href="Capitol%20Records">Capitol Records</a> release from 1984 and an all-new version which featured the complete soundtrack as heard in the film, including alternate versions as well as many cues heard for the first time outside of the film. The soundtrack would be Horner's final contribution to "Star Trek".

"The Search for Spock" received generally positive reviews from critics. <a href="Richard%20Schickel">Richard Schickel</a> of "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" praised the film as "perhaps the first space opera to deserve that term in its grandest sense". Janet Maslin of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" and "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" wrote that while the film felt weighed down by the increasingly aged actors and television tropes, it was leavened by its dedication. <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> called the film "good, but not great" and a compromise between the special effects-dependent "The Motion Picture" and the character-driven "The Wrath of Khan". Conversely, "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" praised the film as the best of the three and the closest to the original spirit of the television series. An overwhelmingly negative view of the film was offered by "<a href="The%20Globe%20and%20Mail">The Globe and Mail</a>"s Susan Ferrier Mackay, who summed the film up as "ba-a-a-d". In a 2010 retrospective of the film franchise, author Jill Sherwin suggests the aging "Enterprise" served as a <a href="metaphor">metaphor</a> for the aging "Star Trek" franchise. The film has received a score of 56/100 on <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, indicating mixed to average reviews, while review aggregator <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> has given it 79%, indicating positive reviews.

Critics praised Nimoy's direction, to which "USA Today" attributed the film's success in capturing the essence of the television show. "Newsweek" wrote that due to Nimoy the film was the best-paced "Trek" film, and that his familiarity with these actors enabled him to bring out the best from them. "Newsweek", and David Sterritt of the "<a href="The%20Christian%20Science%20Monitor">Christian Science Monitor</a>", appreciated how the film slowed the action down to allow moments of reflection, comparing this with the focus of most contemporary action films on effects rather than actors. "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>"s Rita Kempley wrote that Nimoy's direction was competent, but his background in television showed—"the film feels made-for-TV", she summarized. Fellow "Post" critic Gary Arnold concurred with Kempley's television film assessment, but also wrote that Nimoy was smart to focus on the essentials of each scene; he "[concentrates] on the actors in ways that flatter and enhance their work."

"The Search for Spock"s plot solicited comment; Schickel called the film "overplotted" and filled with "heavy expository burdens", comparing it to real opera. Sterritt said that the script occasionally veered in "arbitrary" directions and contained missteps, such as how the "Grissom" and its crew are suddenly lost, but the plot disregards their fate. Arnold wrote that Shatner missed an opportunity to act on par with "The Wrath of Khan"s revelation that Kirk was David's father. The critic considered David's death an attempt at a similar shock, but felt it was not a success. Harry M. Geduld, writing for "The Humanist", criticized the film for what he called "contradictions and implausibilities", such as Scott's sabotage of the "Excelsior" and Spock's regeneration.

The film's sense of self-seriousness and the camaraderie amongst the characters were generally cited as positive aspects. Maslin wrote that certain tacky elements of the film's television roots were outweighed by the closeness of the "Enterprise" crew and "by their seriousness and avidity about what seem to be the silliest minutiae [...] That's what longtime Trekkies love about the series, and it's still here—a little the worse for wear, but mostly untarnished." The "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" wrote that despite its spectacle, the film's "humanity once again outweighs the hardware, and its innocence is downright endearing". Mackay offered an alternate view, calling the characters' actions and dialogue "wooden" and saying that the film's monsters had more life than the acting. Lloyd's portrayal of Kruge received praise from "<a href="New%20York%20%28magazine%29">New York</a>"s David Denby and "<a href="The%20Daily%20News%20%28Kentucky%29">The Daily News</a>"s Hunter Reigler.

The film's effects were conflictingly appraised. Schickel wrote that the effects were "technically adroit" and occasionally "witty", and Ebert singled out the Bird of Prey as a "great-looking" ship. Sterritt felt that the settings always felt like they were on soundstages rather than out in space, and Denby wrote that more could have been done with Genesis, and that while it was an interesting concept its special effects execution was lacking. Kempley appreciated the sets' low values, writing that "the fakier the sets", the closer the film felt to its television origins.

"The Search for Spock" was released on home video in 1985. The initial retail offerings included <a href="VHS">VHS</a>, <a href="Betamax">Betamax</a>, <a href="LaserDisc">LaserDisc</a> and <a href="Capacitance%20Electronic%20Disc">CED</a> formats with <a href="closed%20captioning">closed captioning</a>. As part of a plan to support its push of <a href="8%20mm%20video%20format">8mm video cassette</a>, Sony partnered with Paramount Home Video to bring titles like "The Search for Spock" to the platform in 1986.

The film was given a "bare bones" <a href="DVD">DVD</a> release on May 11, 2000, with no extra features—the release was several months earlier than the release of "The Wrath of Khan". Two years later, a two disc "Collector's Edition" was released with supplemental material and the same video transfer as the original DVD release. It featured a text commentary by <a href="Michael%20Okuda">Michael Okuda</a> and audio commentary from Nimoy, Bennett, Correll, and Curtis.

The film was released on high-definition <a href="Blu-ray%20Disc">Blu-ray Disc</a> in May 2009 to coincide with the new "<a href="Star%20Trek%20%28film%29">Star Trek</a>" feature, along with the other five films featuring the original crew in "Star Trek: Original Motion Picture Collection". "The Search for Spock" was remastered in <a href="1080p">1080p</a> <a href="High-definition%20video">high-definition</a> from the 2000 DVD transfer. All six films in the set have new 7.1 <a href="Dolby%20TrueHD">Dolby TrueHD</a> audio. The disc features a new commentary track by former "", "", and "" television writers <a href="Ronald%20D.%20Moore">Ronald D. Moore</a> and <a href="Michael%20Taylor%20%28screenwriter%29">Michael Taylor</a>.

The film was briefly removed from Netflix in August 2013 because of inaccurately translated Klingon and Vulcan subtitles.

H II region

An H II region or HII region is a region of interstellar <a href="atomic%20hydrogen">atomic hydrogen</a> that is <a href="ionized">ionized</a>. It is typically a cloud of partially ionized <a href="gas">gas</a> in which <a href="star%20formation">star formation</a> has recently taken place, with a size ranging from one to hundreds of light years, and density from a few to about a million particles per cubic cm. The <a href="Orion%20Nebula">Orion Nebula</a>, now known to be an H II region, was observed in 1610 by <a href="Nicolas-Claude%20Fabri%20de%20Peiresc">Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc</a> by telescope, the first such object discovered.

They may be of any shape, because the distribution of the stars and gas inside them is irregular. <a href="Hertzsprung-Russell%20diagram">The short-lived blue stars</a> created in these regions emit copious amounts of <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> light that ionize the surrounding gas. H II regions—sometimes several hundred <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s across—are often associated with <a href="giant%20molecular%20clouds">giant molecular clouds</a>. They often appear clumpy and filamentary, sometimes showing intricate shapes such as the <a href="Horsehead%20Nebula">Horsehead Nebula</a>. H II regions may give birth to thousands of stars over a period of several million years. In the end, <a href="supernova">supernova</a> explosions and strong <a href="stellar%20wind">stellar wind</a>s from the most massive stars in the resulting <a href="star%20cluster">star cluster</a> will disperse the gases of the H II region, leaving behind a cluster of stars which have formed, such as the <a href="Pleiades">Pleiades</a>.

H II regions can be observed at considerable distances in the universe, and the study of extragalactic H II regions is important in determining the distance and chemical composition of <a href="galaxy">galaxies</a>. <a href="Spiral%20galaxy">Spiral</a> and <a href="irregular%20galaxy">irregular</a> galaxies contain many H II regions, while <a href="elliptical%20galaxy">elliptical</a> galaxies are almost devoid of them. In spiral galaxies, including our <a href="Milky%20Way%20%28galaxy%29">Milky Way</a>, H II regions are concentrated in the <a href="spiral%20arm">spiral arm</a>s, while in irregular galaxies they are distributed chaotically. Some galaxies contain huge H II regions, which may contain tens of thousands of stars. Examples include the <a href="30%20Doradus">30 Doradus</a> region in the <a href="Large%20Magellanic%20Cloud">Large Magellanic Cloud</a> and <a href="NGC%20604">NGC 604</a> in the <a href="Triangulum%20Galaxy">Triangulum Galaxy</a>.

The term H II is pronounced "H two" by astronomers. "H" is the chemical symbol for hydrogen, and "II" is the Roman numeral for 2. It is customary in <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a> to use the Roman numeral I for neutral atoms, II for singly-ionised—H II is H in other sciences—III for doubly-ionised, e.g. O III is O, etc. H II, or H, consists of free <a href="protons">protons</a>. An <a href="H%20I%20region">H I region</a> being <a href="electric%20charge">neutral</a> atomic hydrogen, and a <a href="molecular%20cloud">molecular cloud</a> being <a href="molecule">molecular</a> hydrogen, H. In spoken discussion with non-astronomers there is sometimes confusion between the identical spoken forms of "H II" and "H".

A few of the brightest H II regions are visible to the <a href="naked%20eye">naked eye</a>. However, none seem to have been noticed before the advent of the <a href="telescope">telescope</a> in the early 17th century. Even <a href="Galileo%20Galilei">Galileo</a> did not notice the <a href="Orion%20Nebula">Orion Nebula</a> when he first observed the <a href="star%20cluster">star cluster</a> within it (previously cataloged as a single star, θ Orionis, by <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a>). The French observer <a href="Nicolas-Claude%20Fabri%20de%20Peiresc">Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc</a> is credited with the discovery of the Orion Nebula in 1610. Since that early observation large numbers of H II regions have been discovered in the Milky Way and other galaxies.

<a href="William%20Herschel">William Herschel</a> observed the Orion Nebula in 1774, and described it later as "an unformed fiery mist, the chaotic material of future suns". In early days astronomers distinguished between "diffuse nebulae" (now known to be H II regions), which retained their fuzzy appearance under magnification through a large telescope, and nebulae that could be resolved into stars, now known to be galaxies external to our own.

Confirmation of Herschel's hypothesis of star formation had to wait another hundred years, when <a href="William%20Huggins">William Huggins</a> together with his wife <a href="Margaret%20Lindsay%20Huggins">Mary Huggins</a> turned his <a href="spectroscope">spectroscope</a> on various nebulae. Some, such as the <a href="Andromeda%20Galaxy">Andromeda Nebula</a>, had spectra quite similar to those of <a href="star">star</a>s, but turned out to be galaxies consisting of hundreds of millions of individual stars. Others looked very different. Rather than a strong continuum with absorption lines superimposed, the Orion Nebula and other similar objects showed only a small number of <a href="emission%20line">emission line</a>s. In <a href="planetary%20nebulae">planetary nebulae</a>, the brightest of these spectral lines was at a <a href="wavelength">wavelength</a> of 500.7 <a href="nanometre">nanometre</a>s, which did not correspond with a line of any known <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a>. At first it was hypothesized that the line might be due to an unknown element, which was named <a href="nebulium">nebulium</a>—a similar idea had led to the discovery of <a href="helium">helium</a> through analysis of the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>'s spectrum in 1868. However, while helium was isolated on earth soon after its discovery in the spectrum of the sun, nebulium was not. In the early 20th century, <a href="Henry%20Norris%20Russell">Henry Norris Russell</a> proposed that rather than being a new element, the line at 500.7 nm was due to a familiar element in unfamiliar conditions.

Interstellar matter, considered dense in an astronomical context, is at high vacuum by laboratory standards. Physicists showed in the 1920s that in gas at extremely low <a href="density">density</a>, <a href="electron">electron</a>s can populate excited <a href="metastable">metastable</a> <a href="energy%20level">energy level</a>s in <a href="atom">atom</a>s and <a href="ion">ion</a>s, which at higher densities are rapidly de-excited by collisions. Electron transitions from these levels in <a href="doubly%20ionized%20oxygen">doubly ionized oxygen</a> give rise to the 500.7 nm line. These <a href="spectral%20lines">spectral lines</a>, which can only be seen in very low density gases, are called <a href="forbidden%20line">forbidden line</a>s. Spectroscopic observations thus showed that planetary nebulae consisted largely of extremely rarefied ionised oxygen gas (OIII).

During the 20th century, observations showed that H II regions often contained <a href="OB%20star">hot, bright stars</a>. These stars are many times more massive than the Sun, and are the shortest-lived stars, with total lifetimes of only a few million years (compared to stars like the Sun, which live for several billion years). Therefore, it was surmised that H II regions must be regions in which new stars were forming. Over a period of several million years, a cluster of stars will form in an H II region, before <a href="radiation%20pressure">radiation pressure</a> from the hot young stars causes the nebula to disperse. The <a href="Pleiades">Pleiades</a> are an example of a cluster which has 'boiled away' the H II region from which it was formed. Only a trace of <a href="reflection%20nebula">reflection nebulosity</a> remains.

The precursor to an H II region is a <a href="giant%20molecular%20cloud">giant molecular cloud</a> (GMC). A GMC is a cold (10–20 <a href="Kelvin">K</a>) and dense cloud consisting mostly of <a href="molecular%20hydrogen">molecular hydrogen</a>. GMCs can exist in a stable state for long periods of time, but shock waves due to <a href="supernova">supernova</a>e, collisions between clouds, and magnetic interactions can trigger its collapse. When this happens, via a process of collapse and fragmentation of the cloud, stars are born (see <a href="stellar%20evolution">stellar evolution</a> for a lengthier description).

As stars are born within a GMC, the most massive will reach temperatures hot enough to <a href="ionisation">ionise</a> the surrounding gas. Soon after the formation of an ionising radiation field, energetic <a href="photon">photon</a>s create an ionisation front, which sweeps through the surrounding gas at <a href="supersonic">supersonic</a> speeds. At greater and greater distances from the ionising star, the ionisation front slows, while the pressure of the newly ionised gas causes the ionised volume to expand. Eventually, the ionisation front slows to <a href="Speed%20of%20sound">subsonic</a> speeds, and is overtaken by the shock front caused by the expansion of the material ejected from the nebula. The H II region has been born.

The lifetime of an H II region is of the order of a few million years. Radiation pressure from the hot young stars will eventually drive most of the gas away. In fact, the whole process tends to be very inefficient, with less than 10 percent of the gas in the H II region forming into stars before the rest is blown off. Contributing to the loss of gas are the supernova explosions of the most massive stars, which will occur after only 1–2 million years.

Stars form in clumps of cool molecular gas that hide the nascent stars. It is only when the radiation pressure from a star drives away its 'cocoon' that it becomes visible. The hot, blue stars that are powerful enough to ionize significant amounts of hydrogen and form H II regions will do this quickly, and light up the region in which they just formed. The dense regions which contain younger or less massive still-forming stars and which have not yet blown away the material from which they are forming are often seen in silhouette against the rest of the ionised nebula. <a href="Bart%20Bok">Bart Bok</a> and E. F. Reilly searched astronomical photographs in the 1940s for "relatively small dark nebulae", following suggestions that stars might be formed from condensations in the interstellar medium; they found several such "approximately circular or oval dark objects of small size", which they referred to as "globules", since referred to as <a href="Bok%20globule">Bok globule</a>s. Bok proposed at the December 1946 Harvard Observatory Centennial Symposia that these globules were likely sites of star formation. It was confirmed in 1990 that they were indeed stellar birthplaces. The hot young stars dissipate these globules, as the radiation from the stars powering the H II region drives the material away. In this sense, the stars which generate H II regions act to destroy stellar nurseries. In doing so, however, one last burst of star formation may be triggered, as radiation pressure and mechanical pressure from supernova may act to squeeze globules, thereby enhancing the density within them.

The young stars in H II regions show evidence for containing planetary systems. The <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> has revealed hundreds of "protoplanetary disks" (<a href="proplyd">proplyd</a>s) in the Orion Nebula. At least half the young stars in the Orion Nebula appear to be surrounded by disks of gas and dust, thought to contain many times as much matter as would be needed to create a planetary system like the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>.

H II regions vary greatly in their physical properties. They range in size from so-called "ultra-compact" (UCHII) regions perhaps only a <a href="light-year">light-year</a> or less across, to giant H II regions several hundred light-years across. Their size is also known as the <a href="Stromgren%20radius">Stromgren radius</a> and essentially depends on the intensity of the source of ionising photons and the density of the region. Their densities range from over a million particles per cm³ in the ultra-compact H II regions to only a few particles per cm³ in the largest and most extended regions. This implies total masses between perhaps 100 and 10 <a href="solar%20masses">solar masses</a>.

There are also "ultra-dense H II" regions (UDHII).

Depending on the size of an H II region there may be several thousand stars within it. This makes H II regions more complicated than planetary nebulae, which have only one central ionising source. Typically H II regions reach temperatures of 10,000 K. They are mostly ionised gases with weak <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a>s with strengths of several <a href="nanotesla">nanotesla</a>s. Nevertheless, H II regions are almost always associated with a cold molecular gas, which originated from the same parent GMC. Magnetic fields are produced by these weak moving electric charges in the ionised gas, suggesting that H II regions might contain <a href="electric%20field">electric field</a>s.

A number of H II regions also show signs of being permeated by a plasma with temperatures exceeding 10,000,000 K, sufficiently hot to emit X-rays. X-ray observatories such as <a href="Einstein%20Observatory">Einstein</a> and <a href="Chandra%20X-ray%20Observatory">Chandra</a> have noted diffuse X-ray emissions in a number of star-forming regions, notably the Orion Nebula, Messier 17, and the Carina Nebula. The hot gas is likely supplied by the strong stellar winds from O-type stars, which may be heated by supersonic shock waves in the winds, through collisions between winds from different stars, or through colliding winds channeled by magnetic fields. This plasma will rapidly expand to fill available cavities in the molecular clouds due to the high speed of sound in the gas at this temperature. It will also leak out through holes in the periphery of the H II region, which appears to be happening in Messier 17.

Chemically, H II regions consist of about 90% hydrogen. The strongest hydrogen emission line, the <a href="H-alpha">H-alpha</a> line at 656.3 nm, gives H II regions their characteristic red colour. (This emission line comes from excited unionized hydrogen.) Most of the rest of an H II region consists of <a href="helium">helium</a>, with trace amounts of heavier elements. Across the galaxy, it is found that the amount of heavy elements in H II regions decreases with increasing distance from the galactic centre. This is because over the lifetime of the galaxy, star formation rates have been greater in the denser central regions, resulting in greater enrichment of those regions of the <a href="interstellar%20medium">interstellar medium</a> with the products of <a href="nucleosynthesis">nucleosynthesis</a>.

H II regions are found only in <a href="spiral%20galaxy">spiral galaxies</a> like the Milky Way and <a href="irregular%20galaxy">irregular galaxies</a>. They are not seen in <a href="elliptical%20galaxy">elliptical galaxies</a>. In irregular galaxies, they may be dispersed throughout the galaxy, but in spirals they are most abundant within the spiral arms. A large spiral galaxy may contain thousands of H II regions.

The reason H II regions rarely appear in elliptical galaxies is that ellipticals are believed to form through galaxy mergers. In <a href="galaxy%20cluster">galaxy cluster</a>s, such mergers are frequent. When galaxies collide, individual stars almost never collide, but the GMCs and H II regions in the colliding galaxies are severely agitated. Under these conditions, enormous bursts of star formation are triggered, so rapid that most of the gas is converted into stars rather than the normal rate of 10% or less.
Galaxies undergoing such rapid star formation are known as <a href="starburst%20galaxy">starburst galaxies</a>. The post-merger elliptical galaxy has a very low gas content, and so H II regions can no longer form. Twenty-first century observations have shown that a very small number of H II regions exist outside galaxies altogether. These intergalactic H II regions may be the remnants of tidal disruptions of small galaxies, and in some cases may represent a new generation of stars in a galaxy's most recently accreted gas.

H II regions come in an enormous variety of sizes. They are usually clumpy and inhomogeneous on all scales from the smallest to largest. Each star within an H II region ionises a roughly spherical region—known as a "Strömgren sphere"—of the surrounding gas, but the combination of ionisation spheres of multiple stars within a H II region and the expansion of the heated nebula into surrounding gases creates sharp <a href="density%20gradient">density gradient</a>s that result in complex shapes. Supernova explosions may also sculpt H II regions. In some cases, the formation of a large star cluster within an H II region results in the region being hollowed out from within. This is the case for <a href="NGC%20604">NGC 604</a>, a giant H II region in the <a href="Triangulum%20Galaxy">Triangulum Galaxy</a>. For a H II region which cannot be <a href="Angular%20resolution">resolved</a>, some <a href="Laplace%20transform%23Inferring%20spatial%20structure%20from%20spectrum">information on the spatial structure</a> (the <a href="electron%20density">electron density</a> as a function of the distance from the center, and an estimate of the clumpiness) can be inferred by performing an <a href="inverse%20Laplace%20transform">inverse Laplace transform</a> on the frequency spectrum.

Notable Galactic H II regions include the Orion Nebula, the <a href="Carina%20Nebula">Eta Carinae Nebula</a>, and the <a href="NGC%207822">Berkeley 59 / Cepheus OB4 Complex</a>. The Orion Nebula, about 500 <a href="parsec">pc</a> (1,500 light-years) from Earth, is part of <a href="OMC-1">OMC-1</a>, a GMC that, if visible, would be seen to fill most of the constellation of <a href="Orion%20%28constellation%29">Orion</a>. The <a href="Horsehead%20Nebula">Horsehead Nebula</a> and <a href="Barnard%27s%20Loop">Barnard's Loop</a> are two other illuminated parts of this cloud of gas. The Orion Nebula is actually a thin layer of ionised gas on the outer border of the OMC-1 cloud. The stars in the <a href="Trapezium%20cluster">Trapezium cluster</a>, and especially <a href="Theta1%20Orionis%20C">θ Orionis</a>, are responsible for this ionisation.

The <a href="Large%20Magellanic%20Cloud">Large Magellanic Cloud</a>, a satellite galaxy of the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> at about 50 kpc (), contains a giant H II region called the <a href="Tarantula%20Nebula">Tarantula Nebula</a>. Measuring at about () across, this nebula is the most massive and the second-largest H II region in the <a href="Local%20Group">Local Group</a>. It is much bigger than the Orion Nebula, and is forming thousands of stars, some with masses of over 100 times that of the sun—<a href="OB%20star">OB</a> and <a href="Wolf-Rayet%20star">Wolf-Rayet star</a>s. If the Tarantula Nebula were as close to Earth as the Orion Nebula, it would shine about as brightly as the full moon in the night sky. The supernova <a href="SN%201987A">SN 1987A</a> occurred in the outskirts of the Tarantula Nebula.

Another giant H II region—<a href="NGC%20604">NGC 604</a> is located in <a href="Triangulum%20Galaxy">M33</a> spiral galaxy, which is at 817 kpc (2.66 million light years). Measuring at approximately () across, NGC 604 is the second-most-massive H II region in the Local Group after the Tarantula Nebula, although it is slightly larger in size than the latter. It contains around 200 hot OB and Wolf-Rayet stars, which heat the gas inside it to millions of degrees, producing bright <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> emissions. The total mass of the hot gas in NGC 604 is about 6,000 Solar masses.

As with planetary nebulae, estimates of the abundance of <a href="chemical%20element">elements</a> in H II regions are subject to some uncertainty. There are two different ways of determining the abundance of metals (metals in this case are elements other than hydrogen and helium) in nebulae, which rely on different types of spectral lines, and large discrepancies are sometimes seen between the results derived from the two methods. Some astronomers put this down to the presence of small temperature fluctuations within H II regions; others claim that the discrepancies are too large to be explained by temperature effects, and hypothesise the existence of cold knots containing very little hydrogen to explain the observations.

The full details of massive star formation within H II regions are not yet well known. Two major problems hamper research in this area. First, the distance from Earth to large H II regions is considerable, with the nearest H II (<a href="California%20Nebula">California Nebula</a>) region at 300 pc (1,000 light-years); other H II regions are several times that distance from Earth. Secondly, the formation of these stars is deeply obscured by dust, and <a href="visible%20light">visible light</a> observations are impossible. <a href="Radio">Radio</a> and <a href="infrared">infrared</a> light can penetrate the dust, but the youngest stars may not emit much light at these <a href="wavelength">wavelength</a>s.

Gray's Inn

The Honourable Society of Gray's Inn, commonly known as Gray's Inn, is one of the four <a href="Inns%20of%20Court">Inns of Court</a> (professional associations for <a href="barrister">barrister</a>s and judges) in London. To be <a href="called%20to%20the%20bar">called to the bar</a> and practise as a barrister in <a href="England%20and%20Wales">England and Wales</a>, a person must belong to one of these Inns. Located at the intersection of <a href="High%20Holborn">High Holborn</a> and <a href="Gray%27s%20Inn%20Road">Gray's Inn Road</a> in <a href="Central%20London">Central London</a>, the Inn is both a <a href="professional%20body">professional body</a> and a provider of office accommodation (<a href="chambers%20%28law%29">chambers</a>) for many barristers. It is ruled by a governing council called "Pension", made up of the Masters of the Bench (or "<a href="Bencher">Bencher</a>s"), and led by the <a href="Treasurer%23In%20the%20Inns%20of%20Court">Treasurer</a>, who is elected to serve a one-year term. The Inn is known for its gardens, or Walks, which have existed since at least 1597.

Gray's Inn does not claim a specific foundation date; there is a tradition that none of the Inns of Court claims to be any older than the others. <a href="Law%20clerk">Law clerk</a>s and their apprentices have been established on the present site since at least 1370, with records dating from 1381. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the Inn grew steadily with great prestige, reaching its pinnacle during the reign of <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I</a>. The Inn was home to many important barristers and politicians, most notably <a href="Francis%20Bacon">Francis Bacon</a>, and counted Elizabeth herself as a patron. Thanks to the efforts of prominent members such as <a href="William%20Cecil%2C%201st%20Baron%20Burghley">William Cecil</a> and <a href="Gilbert%20Gerard%20%28judge%29">Gilbert Gerard</a>, Gray's Inn became the largest of the four by number, with over 200 barristers recorded as members. During this period, the Inn became noted for the masques and revels that it threw, and <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> is believed to have first performed "<a href="The%20Comedy%20of%20Errors">The Comedy of Errors</a>" there.

The Inn continued to prosper during the reign of <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">James I</a> (1603–1625) and the beginning of that of <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a>, when over 100 students per year were recorded as joining. The outbreak of the <a href="First%20English%20Civil%20War">First English Civil War</a> in 1642 during the reign of Charles I disrupted the systems of legal education and governance at the Inns of Court, shutting down all calls to the Bar and new admissions, and Gray's Inn never fully recovered. Fortunes continued to decline after the <a href="English%20Restoration">English Restoration</a>, which saw the end of the traditional method of legal education. Although now more prosperous, Gray's Inn is today the smallest of the Inns of Court.

Gray's Inn and the other three Inns of Court remain the only bodies legally allowed to <a href="call%20to%20the%20Bar">call</a> a <a href="barrister">barrister</a> to the Bar, allowing him or her to practise in England and Wales. Although the Inn was previously a disciplinary and teaching body, these functions are now shared between the four Inns, with the <a href="Bar%20Standards%20Board">Bar Standards Board</a> (a division of the <a href="General%20Council%20of%20the%20Bar">General Council of the Bar</a>) acting as a disciplinary body and the Inns of Court and Bar Educational Trust providing education. The Inn remains a collegiate self-governing, unincorporated association of its members, providing within its precincts library, dining, residential and office accommodation (<a href="chambers%20%28law%29">chambers</a>), along with a chapel. Members of the Bar from other Inns may use these facilities to some extent.

During the 12th and early 13th centuries, the law was taught in the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a>, primarily by the clergy. Then two events happened which ended the Church's role in legal education: firstly, a <a href="papal%20bull">papal bull</a> that prohibited the clergy from teaching the <a href="common%20law">common law</a>, rather than <a href="canon%20law">canon law</a>; and secondly, a decree by <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">Henry III of England</a> on 2 December 1234 that no institutes of legal education could exist in the City of London. The common law began to be practiced and taught by laymen instead of clerics, and these lawyers migrated to the hamlet of <a href="Holborn">Holborn</a>, just outside the City and near to the law courts at <a href="Westminster%20Hall">Westminster Hall</a>.

The early records of all four <a href="Inns%20of%20Court">Inns of Court</a> have been lost, and it is not known precisely when each was founded. The records of Gray's Inn itself are lost until 1569, and the precise date of founding cannot therefore be verified. <a href="Lincoln%27s%20Inn">Lincoln's Inn</a> has the earliest surviving records. Gray's Inn dates from at least 1370, and takes its name from <a href="Reginald%20de%20Grey%2C%201st%20Baron%20Grey%20de%20Wilton">Baron Grey of Wilton</a>, as the Inn was originally Wilton's family <a href="Townhouse%20%28Great%20Britain%29">townhouse</a> (or inn) within the Manor of Portpoole. A lease was taken for various parts of the inn by practising lawyers as both residential and working accommodation, and their apprentices were housed with them. From this the tradition of dining in "commons", probably by using the inn's main hall, followed as the most convenient arrangement for the members. Outside records from 1437 show that Gray's Inn was occupied by "socii", or members of a society, at that date.

In 1456 Reginald de Gray, the owner of the Manor itself, sold the land to a group including <a href="Thomas%20Bryan%20%28Chief%20Justice%29">Thomas Bryan</a>. A few months later, the other members signed deeds of release, granting the property solely to Thomas Bryan. Bryan acted as either a <a href="feoffee">feoffee</a> or an owner representing the governing body of the Inn (there are some records suggesting he may have been a <a href="Bencher">Bencher</a> at this point) but in 1493 he transferred the ownership by charter to a group including <a href="Robert%20Brudenell%20%28Chief%20Justice%29">Sir Robert Brudenell</a> and Thomas Wodeward, reverting the ownership of the Inn partially back to the Gray family.

In 1506 the Inn was sold by the Gray family to <a href="Hugh%20Denys%20of%20Osterley">Hugh Denys</a> and a group of his feoffees including <a href="Roger%20Lupton">Roger Lupton</a>. This was not a purchase on behalf of the society and after a five-year delay, it was transferred under the will of Denys in 1516 to the <a href="Carthusian">Carthusian</a> House of Jesus of Bethlehem (<a href="Sheen%20Priory">Sheen Priory</a>), which remained the Society's landlord until 1539, when the <a href="Second%20Act%20of%20Dissolution">Second Act of Dissolution</a> led to the <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Monasteries">Dissolution of the Monasteries</a> and passed ownership of the Inn to the Crown.

During the reign of <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I</a>, Gray's Inn rose in prominence, and that period is considered the "golden age" of the Inn, with Elizabeth serving as the Patron Lady. This can be traced to the actions of <a href="Nicholas%20Bacon%20%28courtier%29">Nicholas Bacon</a>, <a href="William%20Cecil%2C%201st%20Baron%20Burghley">William Cecil</a> and <a href="Gilbert%20Gerard%20%28judge%29">Gilbert Gerard</a>, all prominent members of the Inn and confidantes of Elizabeth. Cecil and Bacon in particular took pains to find the most promising young men and get them to join the Inn. In 1574 it was the largest of all the Inns of Court by number, with 120 <a href="barrister">barrister</a>s, and by 1619 it had a membership of more than 200 barristers.

Gray's Inn, as well as the other Inns of Court, became noted for the parties and festivals it hosted. Students performed <a href="masque">masque</a>s and plays in court weddings, in front of Queen Elizabeth herself, and hosted regular festivals and banquets at <a href="Candlemas">Candlemas</a>, <a href="Halloween">All Hallows Eve</a> and Easter. At Christmas the students ruled the Inn for the day, appointing a <a href="Lord%20of%20Misrule">Lord of Misrule</a> called the "Prince of Purpoole", and organising a masque entirely on their own, with the Benchers and other senior members away for the holiday.

The Gray's Inn masque in 1588 with its centrepiece, "<a href="The%20Misfortunes%20of%20Arthur">The Misfortunes of Arthur</a>" by <a href="Thomas%20Hughes%20%28dramatist%29">Thomas Hughes</a>, is considered by <a href="Adolphus%20William%20Ward">A.W. Ward</a> to be the most impressive masque thrown at any of the Inns. <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> performed at the Inn at least once, as his patron, <a href="Henry%20Wriothesley%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Southampton">Lord Southampton</a>, was a member. For the Christmas of 1594, his play "<a href="The%20Comedy%20of%20Errors">The Comedy of Errors</a>" was performed by the <a href="Lord%20Chamberlain%27s%20Men">Lord Chamberlain's Men</a> before a riotous assembly of notables in such disorder that the affair became known as the "Night of Errors" and a mock trial was held to arraign the culprit.

Central to Gray's was the system shared across the Inns of Court of progress towards a <a href="call%20to%20the%20Bar">call to the Bar</a>, which lasted approximately 12 to 14 years. A student would first study at either <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a> or <a href="Cambridge%20University">Cambridge University</a>, or at one of the <a href="Inns%20of%20Chancery">Inns of Chancery</a>, which were dedicated legal training institutions. If he studied at Oxford or Cambridge he would spend three years working towards a degree, and be admitted to one of the Inns of Court after graduation. If he studied at one of the Inns of Chancery he would do so for one year before seeking admission to the Inn of Court to which his Inn of Chancery was tied—in the case of Gray's Inn, the attached Inns of Chancery were <a href="Staple%20Inn">Staple Inn</a> and <a href="Barnard%27s%20Inn">Barnard's Inn</a>.

The student was then considered an "inner barrister", and would study in private, take part in the <a href="moot%20court">moots</a> and listen to the readings and other lectures. After serving from six to nine years as an "inner barrister," the student was called to the Bar, assuming he had fulfilled the requirements of having argued twice at moots in one of the Inns of Chancery, twice in the Hall of his Inn of Court and twice in the Inn Library. The new "utter barrister" was then expected to supervise bolts ("arguments" over a single point of law between students and barristers) and moots at his Inn of Court, attend lectures at the Inns of Court and Chancery and teach students. After five years as an "utter" barrister he was allowed to practice in court—after 10 years he was made an Ancient.

The period saw the establishment of a regular system of legal education. In the early days of the Inn, the quality of legal education had been poor—readings were given infrequently, and the standards for call to the Bar were weak and varied. During the Elizabethan age readings were given regularly, moots took place daily and barristers who were called to the Bar were expected to play a part in teaching students, resulting in skilled and knowledgeable graduates from the Inn.

Many noted barristers, judges and politicians were members of the Inn during this period, including <a href="Gilbert%20Gerard%20%28judge%29">Gilbert Gerard</a>, <a href="Master%20of%20the%20Rolls">Master of the Rolls</a>, <a href="Edmund%20Pelham">Edmund Pelham</a>, <a href="Lord%20Chief%20Justice%20of%20Ireland">Lord Chief Justice of Ireland</a>, and <a href="Francis%20Bacon">Francis Bacon</a>, who served as Treasurer for eight years, supervising significant changes to the facilities of the Inn and the first proper construction of the gardens and walks for which the Inn is noted.

At the start of the <a href="Caroline%20era">Caroline era</a>, when Charles I came to the throne, the Inn continued to prosper. Over 100 students were admitted to the Inn each year, and except during the plague of 1636 the legal education of students continued. Masques continued to be held, including one in 1634 organised by all four Inns that cost £21,000—approximately £ in 2019 terms. Before 1685 the Inn counted as members five <a href="duke">duke</a>s, three <a href="Marquess">marquises</a>, twenty-nine <a href="earl">earl</a>s, five <a href="viscounts">viscounts</a> and thirty-nine <a href="baron">baron</a>s, and during that period "none can exhibit a more illustrious list of great men".

Many academics, including <a href="William%20Holdsworth">William Holdsworth</a>, a man considered to be one of the best legal academics in history, maintain that this period saw a decline in the standard of teaching at all the Inns. From 1640 onwards no readings were held, and barristers such as <a href="Edward%20Coke">Sir Edward Coke</a> remarked at the time that the quality of education at the Inns of Court had decreased. Holdsworth put this down to three things—the introduction of printed books, the disinclination of students to attend moots and readings and the disinclination of the Benchers and Readers to enforce attendance.

With the introduction of printing, written legal texts became more available, reducing the need for students to attend readings and lectures. However, this meant that the students denied themselves the opportunity to query what they had learnt or discuss it in greater detail. Eventually, as students now had a way to learn without attending lectures, they began to excuse themselves from lectures, meetings and moots altogether; in the early 17th century they developed a way of deputising other students to do their moots for them. The Benchers and Readers did little to arrest the decline of the practice of lecturers and readings, first because many probably believed (as the students did) that books were an adequate substitute, and secondly because many were keen to avoid the work of preparing a reading, which cut into their time as practising barristers. These problems were endemic to all the Inns, not just Gray's Inn.

The outbreak of the <a href="First%20English%20Civil%20War">First English Civil War</a> led to a complete suspension of legal education, and from November 1642 until July 1644 no Pension meetings were held. Only 43 students were admitted during the four years of the war, and none were called to the Bar. Meetings of Pension resumed after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Marston%20Moor">Battle of Marston Moor</a> but the education system remained dormant. Although Readers were appointed, none read, and no moots were held. In 1646, after the end of the war, there was an attempt to restore the old system of readings and moots, and in 1647 an order was made that students were required to moot at least once a day. This failed to work, with Readers refusing to read, and the old system of legal education completely died out.

The Caroline period saw a decline in prosperity for Gray's Inn. Although there were many notable members of the Inn, both legal (<a href="Dudley%20Digges">Sir Dudley Digges</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Bedingfield%20%28judge%29">Thomas Bedingfield</a> and <a href="Francis%20Bacon%20%28judge%29">Francis Bacon</a>, for example) and non-legal (including <a href="William%20Juxon">William Juxon</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>), the list could not compare to that of the Elizabethan period. Following the <a href="English%20Restoration">English Restoration</a>, admissions fell to an average of 57 a year.

The fortunes of Gray's Inn continued to decline after the <a href="English%20Restoration">English Restoration</a>, and by 1719 only 22 students were joining the Inn a year. This fall in numbers was partly because the landed gentry were no longer sending sons who had no intention of becoming barristers to study at the Inn. In 1615, 13 students joined the Inn for every student called to the Bar, but by 1713 the ratio had become 2.3 new members to every 1 call.

Over a 50-year period, the Civil War and high taxation under <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William III</a> economically crippled many members of the gentry, meaning that they could not afford to allow their sons to study at the Inns. David Lemmings considers it to have been more serious than that, for two reasons; firstly, <a href="Inner%20Temple">Inner Temple</a> and <a href="Middle%20Temple">Middle Temple</a> had actually shown an increase in membership following the Restoration, and secondly because Gray's Inn had previously had far more "common" members than the other Inns. The decrease in the number of gentry at the Inn could therefore not completely explain the large drop in members.

Gray's Inn was the venue for an early <a href="cricket">cricket</a> match in July 1730 between <a href="London%20Cricket%20Club">London</a> and <a href="Kent%20county%20cricket%20teams">Kent</a>. The original source reports "a cricket-match between the Kentish men and the Londoners for <a href="Pound%20sign">£50</a>, and won by the former", giving the precise location as "a field near the lower end of <a href="Gray%27s%20Inn%20Road">Gray's Inn Lane, London</a>".

In 1733 the requirements for a call to the Bar were significantly revised in a joint meeting between the Benchers of Inner Temple and Gray's Inn, revisions accepted by Lincoln's Inn and Middle Temple, although they were not represented. It is not recorded what these changes were, but after a further discussion in 1762 the Inns adopted a rule that any student with a Master of Arts or <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Laws">Bachelor of Laws</a> degree from the universities of <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a> or <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> could be called to the Bar after three years as a student, and any other student could be called after five years. An attempt was made to increase the quality of legal education at Gray's Inn; in 1753 a barrister, <a href="Danby%20Pickering">Danby Pickering</a>, was employed to lecture there, although this agreement ended in 1761 when he was called to the Bar.

The 18th century was not a particularly prosperous time for the Inn or its members, and few notable barristers were members during this period. Some noted members include <a href="Thomas%20Clarke%20%28jurist%29">Sir Thomas Clarke</a>, the <a href="Master%20of%20the%20Rolls">Master of the Rolls</a>, <a href="James%20Eyre%20%28judge%29">Sir James Eyre</a>, <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20Common%20Pleas">Chief Justice of the Common Pleas</a> and <a href="Samuel%20Romilly">Samuel Romilly</a>, a noted law reformer. In 1780 the Inn was involved in the case of "R v the Benchers of Gray's Inn", a test of the role of the Inns of Court as the sole authority to call students to the Bar. The case was brought to the <a href="Court%20of%20King%27s%20Bench%20%28England%29">Court of King's Bench</a> by William Hart, a student at the Inn, who asked the court (under <a href="Lord%20Mansfield">Lord Mansfield</a>) to order the Inn to call him to the Bar. Mansfield ruled that the Inns of Court were indeed the only organisations able to call students to the Bar, and refused to order the Inns to call Hart.

During the 19th century, the Inns began to stagnate; little had been changed since the 17th century in terms of legal education or practice, except that students were no longer bound to take the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Anglican</a> <a href="sacrament">sacrament</a> before their <a href="call%20to%20the%20Bar">call to the Bar</a>. In 1852 the <a href="Council%20of%20Legal%20Education">Council of Legal Education</a> was established by the Inns, and in 1872 a formal examination for the <a href="call%20to%20the%20Bar">call to the Bar</a> was introduced. Gray's Inn itself suffered more than most; as in the 18th century, the fortunes of its members declined, and many barristers who had been <a href="called%20to%20the%20Bar">called to the Bar</a> at the Inn transferred to others.

Gray's Inn was the smallest of the Inns during the early 20th century, and was noted for its connection to the <a href="Northern%20Circuit">Northern Circuit</a>. During the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, the Inn was badly damaged during <a href="the%20Blitz">the Blitz</a> in 1941, with the Hall, the Chapel, the Library and many other buildings hit and almost destroyed. The rebuilding of much of the Inn took until 1960 by the architect Sir <a href="Edward%20Maufe">Edward Maufe</a>. In 2008 Gray's Inn became the first Inn to appoint "fellows"—elected businesspeople, legal academics and others—with the intent of giving them a wider perspective and education than the other Inns would offer.

Gray's Inn's internal records date from 1569, at which point there were four types of member; those who had not yet been <a href="called%20to%20the%20Bar">called to the Bar</a>, Utter Barristers, Ancients and Readers. Utter Barristers were those who had been called to the Bar but were still studying, Ancients were those who were called to the Bar and were allowed to practise and Readers were those who had been called to the Bar, were allowed to practise and now played a part in educating law students at the <a href="Inns%20of%20Chancery">Inns of Chancery</a> and at Gray's Inn itself. At the time Gray's Inn was the odd one out amongst the Inns; the others did not recognise Ancients as a degree of barrister and had Benchers roughly corresponding to the Readers used at Gray's Inn (although the positions were not identical).

The Inn is run by Pension, its ultimate governing body. The name is peculiar to Gray's Inn—at <a href="Lincoln%27s%20Inn">Lincoln's Inn</a> the governing body is called the Council, and at the <a href="Inner%20Temple">Inner</a> and <a href="Middle%20Temple">Middle Temple</a>s it is called the Parliament. The name was used for the governing bodies of three of the Inns of Chancery—<a href="Barnard%27s%20Inn">Barnard's Inn</a>, <a href="Clement%27s%20Inn">Clement's Inn</a> and <a href="New%20Inn%20%28Inn%20of%20Chancery%29">New Inn</a>. In Gray's Inn the Readers, when they existed, were required to attend Pension meetings, and other barristers were at one point welcome to, although only the Readers would be allowed to speak. Pension at Gray's Inn is made up of the Masters of the Bench, and the Inn as a whole is headed by the Treasurer, a senior Bencher. The Treasurer has always been elected, and since 1744 the office has rotated between individuals, with a term of one year.

A <a href="Reader%20%28Inns%20of%20Court%29">Reader</a> was a person literally elected to read—he would be elected to the Pension (council) of Gray's Inn, and would take his place by giving a "reading", or lecture, on a particular legal topic. Two readers would be elected annually by Pension to serve a one-year term. Initially (before the rise of the Benchers) the Readers were the governing body of Gray's Inn, and formed Pension. The earliest certain records of Readers are from the 16th century—although the Inn's records only start at 1569 <a href="William%20Dugdale">William Dugdale</a> (himself a member) published a list in his "Origines Juridiciales" dating from 1514. S.E. Thorne published a list dating from 1430, but this is entirely conjectural and not based on any official records, only reports of "readings" that took place at Gray's Inn. By 1569 there had certainly been Readers for more than a century.

The <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a> marked the end of legal education at the Inns, and the class of Readers went into decline. The last Readers were appointed in 1677, and the position of the Readers as heads of the Inn and members of Pension was taken by the Benchers.

A Bencher, Benchsitter or (formally) Master of the Bench, is a member of Pension, the governing body of the Honourable Society of Gray's Inn. The term originally referred to one who sat on the benches in the main hall of the Inn which were used for dining and during moots, and the term originally had no significance. The position of Bencher developed during the 16th century when the Readers, for unknown reasons, decided that some barristers who were not Readers should be afforded the same rights and privileges as those who were, although without a voice in Pension. This was a rare practice and occurred a total of seven times within the 16th century, the first being Robert Flynt in 1549. The next was <a href="Nicholas%20Bacon%20%28courtier%29">Nicholas Bacon</a> in 1550, then <a href="Edward%20Stanhope%20%28disambiguation%29">Edward Stanhope</a> in 1580, who was afforded the privilege because, although a skilled attorney, an illness meant he could never fulfil the duties of a Reader.

The practice became more common during the 17th century—11 people were made Benchers between 1600 and 1630—and in 1614 one of the Benchers appointed was explicitly allowed to be a member of Pension. This became more common, creating a two-rank system in which both Readers and Benchers were members of Pension. However far more Readers were appointed than Benchers—50 between 1600 and 1630—and it appeared that Readers would remain the higher rank despite this change.

The <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a> marked the end of legal education at the Inns, although the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20England">government</a> attempted to persuade Readers to continue by threatening them with fines. The class of Readers went into decline and Benchers were called as members of Pension instead. In 1679 there was the first mass-call of Benchers (22 on one occasion, and 15 on another), with the Benchers paying a fine of 100 marks because they refused to read, and modern Benchers pay a "fine" in a continuation of this tradition.

Noted Benchers of Gray's Inn include <a href="F.%20E.%20Smith%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Birkenhead">Lord Birkenhead</a> and <a href="Francis%20Bacon">Francis Bacon</a>. Honorary Benchers can also be appointed, although they have no role in Pension, such as <a href="Lord%20Denning">Lord Denning</a>, who was appointed in 1979, and <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>. Today there are over 300 Benchers in Gray's Inn, mostly senior barristers and members of the judiciary.

Gray's Inn does not possess a <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a> as such, but instead uses a badge, often displayed on a shield, <a href="blazon">blazon</a>ed either "<a href="Azure%20%28heraldry%29">Azure</a> an Indian Griffin <a href="Tincture%20%28heraldry%29%23Proper">proper</a> <a href="Attitude%20%28heraldry%29%23Segreant">segreant</a>" or, more currently, "<a href="Sable%20%28heraldry%29">Sable</a> a griffin segreant <a href="Or%20%28heraldry%29">or</a>", i.e., a gold <a href="griffin">griffin</a> on a black background. The Inn originally used a form of the coat of arms of the de Grey family, but this was changed at some time around 1600 to the griffin. There is no direct record of why this was done, but it seems likely that the new device was adapted from the arms of the Treasurer Richard Aungier (d. 1597), for two probable reasons: firstly, because he was a particularly important and prestigious member of the Inn, and secondly, because the griffin would have looked more impressive on occasions such as masques and revels than the plain geometric arms of the de Greys.

The motto around the badge, the date of adoption of which is unknown, is "Integra Lex Aequi Custos Rectique Magistra Non Habet Affectus Sed Causas Gubernat", or "Impartial justice, guardian of equity, mistress of the law, without fear or favour rules men's causes aright".

The Inn is located at the intersection of <a href="High%20Holborn">High Holborn</a> and <a href="Gray%27s%20Inn%20Road">Gray's Inn Road</a>. It started as a single <a href="manor%20house">manor house</a> with a hall and chapel, although an additional wing had been added by the date of the <a href="Woodcut%20map%20of%20London">"Woodcut" map of London</a>, drawn probably in the early 1560s. Expansion continued over the following decades, and by 1586 the Pension had added another two wings around the central <a href="Courtyard">court</a>. Around these were several sets of <a href="chambers%20%28law%29">chambers</a> erected by members of the Inn under a <a href="leasehold">leasehold</a> agreement whereby ownership of the buildings would revert to the Inn at the end of the lease.

As the Inn grew it became necessary (for safety purposes) to wall off the land owned by the Inn, which had previously been open to everyone. In 1591 the "back field" was walled off, but little more was done until 1608, when under the supervision of <a href="Francis%20Bacon">Francis Bacon</a>, the Treasurer, more construction work was undertaken, particularly in walling off and improving the gardens and walks. In 1629 it was ordered that an architect supervise any construction and ensure that the new buildings were architecturally similar to the old ones, and the strict enforcement of this rule during the 18th century is given as a reason for the uniformity of the buildings at Gray's Inn.

During the late 17th century many buildings were demolished, either because of poor repair or to standardise and modernise the buildings at the Inn. Many more were built over the open land surrounding the Inn, although this was controversial at the time; in November 1672 the <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Most%20Honourable%20Privy%20Council">Privy Council</a> and <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> himself were petitioned to order that nothing should be built on the open land, and a similar request was sent to the <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a> in May 1673. From 1672 to 1674 additional buildings were constructed in the Red Lyon Fields by <a href="Nicholas%20Barbon">Nicholas Barebone</a>, and members of the Inn attempted to sue him to prevent this. After the lawsuits failed members of the Inn were seen to fight with Barebones' workmen, "wherein several were shrewdly hurt".

In February 1679 a fire broke out on the west side of Coney Court, necessitating the rebuilding of the entire row. Another fire broke out in January 1684 in Coney Court, destroying several buildings including the Library. A third fire in 1687 destroyed a large part of Holborn Court, and when the buildings were rebuilt after these fires they were constructed of brick to be more resistant to fire than the wood and plaster previously used in construction. As a result, the domestic <a href="Tudor%20style%20architecture">Tudor style architecture</a> which had dominated much of the Inn was replaced with more modern styles. Records show that prior to the rebuilding in 1687, the Inn had been "so incommodious" that the "ancients" were forced to work two to a chamber. More of the Inn was rebuilt during that period, and between 1669 and 1774 all of the Inn apart from parts of the Hall and Chapel had been rebuilt.

More buildings were constructed during the 18th and 19th centuries. In 1941 the Inn suffered under <a href="The%20Blitz">The Blitz</a>, which damaged or destroyed much of the Inn, necessitating the repair of many buildings and the construction of more. Today many buildings are let as professional offices for barristers and solicitors with between and of office space available. There are also approximately 60 residential apartments, rented out to barristers who are members of the Inn. The Inn also contains the <a href="Inns%20of%20Court%20School%20of%20Law">Inns of Court School of Law</a>, a joint educational venture between all four Inns of Court where the vocational training for barristers and solicitors is undertaken. The current Inn layout consists of two squares—South Square and Gray's Inn Square—with the remaining buildings arranged around the Walks.

The Hall was part of the original Manor of Portpoole, although it was significantly rebuilt during the reign of <a href="Mary%20I%20of%20England">Mary I</a>, and again during the reign of Elizabeth, with the rebuilding being finished on 10 November 1559. The rebuilt Hall measured in length, in width and in height, and remains about the same size today. It has a <a href="hammerbeam%20roof">hammerbeam roof</a> and a raised dais at one end with a grand table on it, where the Benchers and other notables would originally have sat.

The hall also contains a large carved screen at one end covering the entrance to the <a href="Vestibule%20%28architecture%29">Vestibule</a>. Legend says that the screen was given to the Inn by <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I</a> while she was the Inn's patron, and is carved out of the wood of a Spanish galleon captured from the <a href="Spanish%20Armada">Spanish Armada</a>. The Hall was lit with the aid of massive windows filled with the <a href="Coat%20of%20Arms">Coats of Arms</a> of those members who became Treasurers. The Benchers' table is also said to have been a gift from Elizabeth, and as a result the only public toast in the Inn until the late 19th century was "to the glorious, pious and immortal memory of Queen Elizabeth".

The walls of the Hall are decorated with paintings of noted patrons or members of the Inn, including <a href="Nicholas%20Bacon%20%28courtier%29">Nicholas Bacon</a> and Elizabeth I. During the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> the Hall was one of those buildings badly damaged during <a href="the%20Blitz">the Blitz</a>. The Treasurers' Arms and paintings had been moved to a place of safety and were not damaged; during the rebuilding after the War they were put back in the Hall, where they remain. The rebuilt hall was designed by Edward Maufe, and was formally opened in 1951 by the <a href="Prince%20Henry%2C%20Duke%20of%20Gloucester">Duke of Gloucester</a>.

The Chapel existed in the original manor house used by the Inn, and dates from 1315. In 1625 it was enlarged under the supervision of <a href="Eubule%20Thelwall%20%28politician%29">Eubule Thelwall</a>, but by 1698 it was "very ruinous", and had to be rebuilt. Little is known of the changes, except that the barrister's <a href="chambers%20%28law%29">chambers</a> above the Chapel were removed. The building was again rebuilt in 1893, and remained that way until its destruction during <a href="The%20Blitz">The Blitz</a> in 1941. The Chapel was finally rebuilt in 1960, and the original stained glass windows (which had been removed and taken to a safe location) were restored. The rebuilt Chapel contains "simple furnishings" made of Canadian <a href="maple">maple</a> donated by the <a href="Canadian%20Bar%20Association">Canadian Bar Association</a>.

The Inn has had a Chaplain since at least 1400, where a court case is recorded as being brought by the "Chaplain of Greyes Inn". During the 16th century the Inn began hiring full-time preachers to staff the Chapel—the first, John Cherke, was appointed in 1576. A radical <a href="Puritan">Puritan</a> in a time of religious conflict, Cherke held his post for only a short time before being replaced by a Thomas Crooke in 1580. After Crooke's death in 1598 Roger Fenton served as preacher, until his replacement by <a href="Richard%20Sibbes">Richard Sibbes</a>, later Master of <a href="Catherine%20Hall%2C%20Cambridge">Catherine Hall, Cambridge</a>, in 1616. Gray's Inn still employs a Preacher; <a href="Michael%20Doe%20%28bishop%29">Michael Doe</a>, former <a href="Bishop%20of%20Swindon">Bishop of Swindon</a> and more recently General Secretary of the <a href="USPG">United Society for the Propagation of the Gospel</a>, was appointed in 2011.

The Walks are the gardens within Gray's Inn, and have existed since at least 1597, when records show that <a href="Francis%20Bacon">Francis Bacon</a> was to be paid £7 for "planting of trees in the walkes". Prior to this the area (known as Green Court) was used as a place to dump waste and rubble, since at the time the Inn was open to any Londoner. In 1587 four Benchers were ordered by the Pension to "consider what charge a brick wall in the fields will draw unto And where the said wall shalbe fittest to be builded", and work on such a wall was completed in 1598, which helped keep out the citizens of London.

In 1599 additional trees were planted in the Walks, and stairs up to the Walks were also added. When Francis Bacon became treasurer in 1608 more improvements were made, since he no longer had to seek the approval of the Pension to make changes. In September 1608 a gate was installed on the southern wall, and various gardeners were employed to maintain the Walks. The gardens became commonly used as a place of relaxation, and <a href="James%20Howell">James Howell</a> wrote in 1621 that "I hold [Gray's Inn Walks] to be the pleasantest place about London, and that there you have the choicest society".

The Walks were well-maintained during the reign of <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William III</a>, although the Inn's lack of prosperity made more improvements impossible. In 1711 the gardener was ordered not to admit "any women or children into the Walkes", and in 1718 was given permission to physically remove those he found. At the end of the 18th century Charles Lamb said that the Walks were "the best gardens of any of the Inns of Court, their aspect being altogether reverend and law-abiding". In 1720 the old gate was replaced by "a pair of handsome iron gates with peers and other proper imbellishments". The 19th and 20th centuries saw few major changes, apart from the introduction of <a href="Platanus">plane trees</a> into the Walks.

The Walks are listed Grade II* on the <a href="Register%20of%20Historic%20Parks%20and%20Gardens%20of%20special%20historic%20interest%20in%20England">Register of Historic Parks and Gardens</a>.

The Library of Gray's Inn has existed since at least 1555, when the first mention of it was made in the will of Robert Chaloner, who left some money to buy law books for the Library. The Library was neither a big collection nor a dedicated one; in 1568 it was being housed in a single room in the chambers of <a href="Nicholas%20Bacon%20%28courtier%29">Nicholas Bacon</a>, a room that was also used for <a href="mooting">mooting</a> and to store the <a href="deed">deed</a> chest. The collection grew larger over the years as individual Benchers such as <a href="John%20Finch%2C%201st%20Baron%20Finch">Sir John Finch</a> and <a href="John%20Bankes">Sir John Bankes</a> left books or money to buy books in their wills, and the first Librarian was appointed in 1646 after members of the Inn had been found stealing books.

In 1669 books were bought by the Inn as an organisation for the first time, and a proper catalogue was drawn up to prevent theft. In 1684 a fire that broke out in Coney Court, where the Library was situated, and destroyed much of the collection. While some books were saved, most of the records prior to 1684 were lost. A "handsome room" was then built to house the Library.

The Library became more important during the 18th century; prior to that it had been a small, little-used collection of books. In 1725 it was proposed by the Pension that "a publick Library be sett up and kept open for ye use of ye society", and that more books be purchased. The first order of new books was on 27 June 1729 and consisted of "a collection of <a href="Francis%20Bacon">Lord Bacon</a>'s works". In 1750 the Under-Steward of the Inn made a new catalogue of the books, and in 1789 the Library was moved to a new room between the Hall and the Chapel. In 1840 another two rooms were erected in which to store books, and in 1883 a new Library was constructed with space to store approximately 11,000 books. This was rapidly found to be inadequate, and in 1929 a new Library, known as the Holker Library after the benefactor, <a href="John%20Holker">Sir John Holker</a>, was opened. The library, although impressive looking, was not particularly useful; Francis Cowper wrote that: Though impressive to look at, the new building was something less than a success as a library. The air of spaciousness was produced at the expense of shelf room, and though in the octagon [at the north end] the decorative effect of row upon row of books soaring upwards towards the cornice was considerable, the loftiest were totally inaccessible save to those who could scale the longest and dizziest ladders. Further, the appointments were of such surpassing mag-nificence that no ink-pots were allowed in the room for fear of accidents.

The building did not last very long—damage to the Inn during <a href="the%20Blitz">the Blitz</a> completely destroyed the Library and a large part of its collection, although the rare manuscripts, which had been moved elsewhere, survived. After the destruction of much of the Inn's collection, <a href="George%20VI%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George VI</a> donated replacements for many lost texts. A prefabricated building in the Walks was used to hold the surviving books while a new Library was constructed, and the new building (designed by <a href="Edward%20Maufe">Sir Edward Maufe</a>) was opened in 1958. It is similar in size to the old Holker Library, but is more workmanlike and designed to allow for easy access to the books.

Having existed for over 600 years, Gray's Inn has a long list of notable members and honorary members. Even as the smallest of the <a href="Inns%20of%20Court">Inns of Court</a> it has had members who have been particularly noted lawyers and judges, such as <a href="Francis%20Bacon">Francis Bacon</a>, <a href="F.%20E.%20Smith%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Birkenhead">The 1st Earl of Birkenhead</a>, <a href="Gordon%20Slynn%2C%20Baron%20Slynn%20of%20Hadley">Baron Slynn</a>, <a href="Lord%20Bingham%20of%20Cornhill">Lord Bingham of Cornhill</a>, <a href="Lord%20Hoffmann">Lord Hoffmann</a> and others. Outside the Bar and judiciary of England and Wales, members have included the clergy (including five <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishops of Canterbury</a>), industrialists like <a href="John%20Wynne%20%28industrialist%29">John Wynne</a>, astronomers such as <a href="John%20Lee%20%28astronomer%29">John Lee</a>, media figures, like <a href="Huw%20Thomas">Huw Thomas</a>, and members of the Bar and judiciary of other nations, such as <a href="Yang%20Ti-liang">Sir Ti-liang Yang</a> (former <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20of%20Hong%20Kong">Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Hong Kong</a>), <a href="B.%20R.%20Ambedkar">B.

Dick Turpin

Richard Turpin (bapt. 21 September 1705 – 7 April 1739) was an English <a href="highwayman">highwayman</a> whose exploits were romanticised following his execution in York for <a href="horse%20theft">horse theft</a>. Turpin may have followed his father's trade as a <a href="butcher">butcher</a> early in his life but, by the early 1730s, he had joined a gang of deer thieves and, later, became a <a href="poaching">poacher</a>, <a href="burglary">burglar</a>, horse thief and killer. He is also known for a fictional overnight ride from London to York on his horse Black Bess, a story that was made famous by the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> novelist <a href="William%20Harrison%20Ainsworth">William Harrison Ainsworth</a> almost 100 years after Turpin's death.

Turpin's involvement in the crime with which he is most closely associated—highway robbery—followed the arrest of the other members of his gang in 1735. He then disappeared from public view towards the end of that year, only to resurface in 1737 with two new accomplices, one of whom he may have accidentally shot and killed. Turpin fled from the scene and shortly afterwards killed a man who attempted his capture. 

Later that year, he moved to <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> and assumed the alias of John Palmer. While he was staying at an inn, local magistrates became suspicious of "Palmer" and made enquiries as to how he funded his lifestyle. Suspected of being a horse thief, "Palmer" was imprisoned in <a href="York%20Castle">York Castle</a>, to be tried at the next <a href="Assize%20Court">assizes</a>. Turpin's true identity was revealed by a letter he wrote to his brother-in-law from his prison cell, which fell into the hands of the authorities. On 22 March 1739, Turpin was found guilty on two charges of horse theft and sentenced to death; he was executed on 7 April 1739.

Turpin became the subject of legend after his execution, romanticised as dashing and heroic in English <a href="ballads">ballads</a> and popular theatre of the 18th and 19th centuries and in film and <a href="Dick%20Turpin%20%28TV%20series%29">television</a> of the 20th century.

Richard Turpin was born at the Blue Bell Inn (later the Rose and Crown) in <a href="Hempstead%2C%20Essex">Hempstead, Essex</a>, the fifth of six children to John Turpin and Mary Elizabeth Parmenter. He was <a href="baptised">baptised</a> on 21 September 1705, in the same parish where his parents had been married more than ten years earlier.

Turpin's father was a butcher and innkeeper. Several stories suggest that Dick Turpin may have followed his father into these trades; one hints that, as a teenager, he was <a href="apprentice">apprentice</a>d to a butcher in the village of <a href="Whitechapel">Whitechapel</a>, while another proposes that he ran his own butcher's shop in <a href="Thaxted">Thaxted</a>. Testimony from his trial in 1739 suggests that he had a rudimentary education and, although no records survive of the date of the union, that in about 1725 he married Elizabeth Millington. Following his apprenticeship they moved north to <a href="Buckhurst%20Hill">Buckhurst Hill</a>, Essex, where Turpin opened a butcher's shop.

Turpin most likely became involved with the Essex gang of deer thieves in the early 1730s. Deer poaching had long been endemic in the <a href="Waltham%20Forest">Royal Forest of Waltham</a>, and in 1723 the <a href="Black%20Act">Black Act</a> (so called because it outlawed the blackening or disguising of faces while in the forests) was enacted to deal with such problems. Deer stealing was a domestic offence that was judged not in civil courts, but before <a href="Justice%20of%20the%20peace">justices of the peace</a>; it was not until 1737 that the more severe penalty of seven years' <a href="Penal%20transportation">transportation</a> was introduced. However, in 1731 seven <a href="verderer">verderer</a>s became so concerned by the increase in activity that they signed an affidavit which demonstrated their worries. The statement was lodged with <a href="Thomas%20Pelham-Holles%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Newcastle">Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle</a>, who responded by offering a £10 reward to anyone who helped identify the thieves, plus a pardon for those thieves who gave up their colleagues. Following a series of nasty incidents, including the threatened murder of a keeper and his family, in 1733 the government increased the reward to £50 (about £ as of 2019).

The Essex gang (sometimes called the Gregory Gang), which included Samuel Gregory, his brothers Jeremiah and Jasper, Joseph Rose, Mary Brazier (the gang's <a href="Fence%20%28criminal%29">fence</a>), John Jones, <a href="Thomas%20Rowden">Thomas Rowden</a> and a young John Wheeler, needed contacts to help them to dispose of the deer. Turpin, a young butcher who traded in the area, almost certainly became involved with their activities. By 1733 the changing fortunes of the gang may have prompted him to leave the butchery trade, and he became the landlord of a public house, most likely the Rose and Crown at <a href="Clay%20Hill%2C%20London">Clay Hill</a>. Although there is no evidence to suggest that Turpin was directly involved in the thefts, by summer 1734 he was a close associate of the gang, which may indicate that he had been known to them for some time.

By October 1734 several in the gang had either been captured or had fled, and the remaining members moved away from poaching, raiding the home of a <a href="Candle">chandler</a> and <a href="grocer">grocer</a> named Peter Split, at <a href="Woodford%2C%20London">Woodford</a>. Although the identities of the perpetrators are unknown, Turpin may have been involved. Two nights later they struck again, at the Woodford home of a <a href="gentleman">gentleman</a> named Richard Woolridge, a Furnisher of Small Arms in the Office of Ordnance at the Tower of London. In December Jasper and Samuel Gregory, John Jones, and John Wheeler, attacked the home of John Gladwin (a <a href="higler">higler</a>) and John Shockley, in <a href="Chingford">Chingford</a>. On 19 December Turpin and five other men raided the home of Ambrose Skinner, a 73-year-old farmer from <a href="Barking%2C%20London">Barking</a>, leaving with an estimated £300.

Two days later, the gang—minus Turpin—attacked the home of a Keeper, William Mason, at <a href="Epping%20Forest">Epping Forest</a>. During the robbery Mason's servant managed to escape, and returned about an hour later with several neighbours, by which time the house was ransacked and the thieves long gone. On 11 January 1735 the gang raided the <a href="Charlton%2C%20London">Charlton</a> home of a Mr. Saunders. For the robbery of a gentleman named Sheldon, one week later at <a href="Croydon">Croydon</a>, Turpin arrived masked and armed with pistols, with four other members of the gang. In the same month two men, possibly from the same gang, raided the home of a Reverend Mr. Dyde. The clergyman was absent but the two cut his manservant around the face "in a barbarous manner". Another brutal attack occurred on 1 February 1735 at <a href="Loughton">Loughton</a>:

The gang lived in or around London. For a time Turpin stayed at <a href="Whitechapel">Whitechapel</a>, before moving to <a href="Millbank">Millbank</a>. On 4 February 1735 he met John Fielder, Samuel Gregory, Joseph Rose, and John Wheeler, at an inn along <a href="Broadway%2C%20London">The Broadway</a> in London. They planned to rob the house of Joseph Lawrence, a farmer at Earlsbury Farm in <a href="Edgware">Edgware</a>. Late that afternoon, after stopping twice along the way for food and drink, they captured a shepherd boy and burst into the house, armed with pistols. They bound the two maidservants, and brutally attacked the 70-year-old farmer. They pulled his <a href="breeches">breeches</a> around his ankles, and dragged him around the house, but Lawrence refused to reveal the whereabouts of his money. Turpin beat Lawrence's bare buttocks with his pistols, badly bruising him, and other members of the gang beat him around the head with their pistols. They emptied a kettle of water over his head, forced him to sit bare-buttocked on the fire, and pulled him around the house by his nose, and hair. Gregory took one of the maidservants upstairs and raped her. For their trouble, the gang escaped with a haul of less than £30.

Three days later Turpin, accompanied by the same men along with William Saunders and Humphrey Walker, brutally raided a farm in <a href="Marylebone">Marylebone</a>. The attack netted the gang just under £90. The next day the Duke of Newcastle offered a reward of £50 in exchange for information leading to the conviction of the "several persons" involved in the two Woodford robberies, and the robberies of the widow Shelley and Reverend Dyde. On 11 February Fielder, Saunders, and Wheeler, were apprehended. Two accounts of their capture exist. One claims that on their way to rob the Lawrence household the gang had stopped at an alehouse in Edgware, and that on 11 February, while out walking, the owner noticed a group of horses outside an alehouse in <a href="Bloomsbury">Bloomsbury</a>. He recognised these horses as those used by the same group of men who had stopped at his alehouse before the Lawrence attack, and called for the <a href="parish%20constable">parish constable</a>. Another account claims that two of the gang were spotted by a servant of Joseph Lawrence. Regardless, the three, who were drinking with a woman (possibly Mary Brazier) were promptly arrested and committed to prison. Wheeler, who may have been as young as 15, quickly betrayed his colleagues, and descriptions of those yet to be captured were circulated in the press. In the "<a href="London%20Gazette">London Gazette</a>", Turpin was described as "Richard Turpin, a butcher by trade, is a tall fresh coloured man, very much marked with the <a href="small%20pox">small pox</a>, about 26 years of age, about five feet nine inches high, lived some time ago in Whitechapel and did lately lodge somewhere about Millbank, Westminster, wears a blue grey coat and a natural wig".

Once Wheeler's confession became apparent, the other members of the gang fled their usual haunts. Turpin informed Gregory and the others of Wheeler's capture, and left <a href="Westminster">Westminster</a>. On 15 February 1735, while Wheeler was busy confessing to the authorities, "three or four men" (most likely Samuel Gregory, Herbert Haines, Turpin, and possibly Thomas Rowden) robbed the house of a Mrs St. John at <a href="Chingford">Chingford</a>. 

On the following day Turpin (and Rowden, if present) parted company with Gregory and Haines, and headed for Hempstead to see his family. Gregory and Haines may have gone looking for Turpin, because on 17 February they stopped at an alehouse in <a href="Debden%2C%20Epping%20Forest">Debden</a> and ordered a shoulder of mutton, intending to stay for the night. However, a man named Palmer recognised them, and called for the parish constable. A fracas ensued, during which the two thieves escaped. They rejoined Turpin, and along with Jones and Rowden may have travelled to <a href="Gravesend%2C%20Kent">Gravesend</a> before returning to Woodford. Another robbery was reported at Woodford toward the end of February—possibly by Gregory and his cohorts—but with most avenues of escape cut off, and with the authorities hunting them down, the remaining members of the Essex gang kept their heads down and remained under cover, probably in Epping Forest.

Six days after the arrest of Fielder, Saunders, and Wheeler, just as Turpin and his associates were returning from Gravesend, Rose, Brazier, and Walker were captured at a chandler's shop in Westminster, while drinking <a href="Punch%20%28drink%29">punch</a>. Fielder, Rose, Saunders and Walker were tried at the <a href="Middlesex%20Quarter%20Sessions">Middlesex General Session</a> between 26 February and 1 March 1735. Turpin and Gregory were also named on the indictments for burglary. Walker died while still in <a href="Newgate%20Prison">Newgate Prison</a>, but the remaining three were hanged at <a href="Tyburn%23Tyburn%20gallows">Tyburn gallows</a> on 10 March, before their bodies were hung to rot in <a href="gibbet">gibbet</a>s on <a href="Edgware%20Road">Edgware Road</a>. Walker's body was hung in chains. Two days before the hanging, a report of "four suspicious men" being driven away from an alehouse at <a href="East%20Sheen">East Sheen</a> appeared in a newspaper, and was likely describing Gregory and his companions, but the remaining members of the Essex gang were not reported again until 30 March, when three of them (unsuccessfully) tried to steal a horse from a servant of the Earl of Suffolk. 

Turpin was present with four of the gang at another robbery, reported on 8 March. Jasper Gregory meanwhile was captured, and then executed late in March. His brothers were arrested on 9 April in <a href="Rake%2C%20West%20Sussex">Rake, West Sussex</a>, after a struggle during which Samuel lost the tip of his nose to a sword, and Jeremy was shot in the leg. He died in <a href="Winchester%20gaol">Winchester gaol</a>; Samuel was tried in May, and executed on 4 June. His body was later moved, to hang in chains alongside those of his colleagues at Edgware. Mary Brazier was <a href="Penal%20transportation">transported</a> to the <a href="Thirteen%20Colonies">Thirteen Colonies</a>. Herbert Haines was captured on 13 April, and executed in August. John Wheeler, who had been instrumental in proving the cases against his former colleagues, and who was freed, died at <a href="Hackney%20%28parish%29">Hackney</a> in January 1738. The reason for his death is not recorded, but is assumed to be natural causes.

With the Essex gang now smashed by the authorities, Turpin turned instead to the crime he became most noted for – <a href="highway%20robbery">highway robbery</a>. Although he may have been involved in earlier highway robberies on 10 and 12 April, he was first identified as a suspect in one event on 10 July, as "Turpin the butcher", along with Thomas Rowden, "the pewterer". Several days later the two struck at Epping Forest, depriving a man from <a href="Southwark">Southwark</a> of his belongings. With a further bounty of £100 on their heads they continued their activities through the latter half of 1735. In August they robbed five people accompanying a coach on <a href="Barnes%2C%20London%23Barnes%20Common%20and%20Wetlands">Barnes Common</a>, and shortly after that they attacked another coach party, between <a href="Putney">Putney</a> and <a href="Kingston%20Vale">Kingston Hill</a>. On 20 August the pair relieved a Mr Godfrey of six <a href="guineas">guineas</a> and a pocket book, on <a href="Hounslow%20Heath">Hounslow Heath</a>. Fearing capture, they moved on to Blackheath in <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>, and then back to London. On 5 December the two were seen near <a href="Winchester">Winchester</a>, but in late December, following the capture of John Jones, they separated. Rowden had previously been convicted of <a href="Counterfeit%20money">counterfeiting</a>, and in July 1736 he was convicted of passing counterfeit coin, under the alias Daniel Crispe. Crispe's true name was eventually discovered and he was transported in June 1738. Jones also suffered transportation, to the <a href="Thirteen%20Colonies">Thirteen Colonies</a>.

Little is known of Turpin's movements during 1736. He may have travelled to <a href="Holland">Holland</a>, as various sightings were reported there, but he may also have assumed an alias and disappeared from public view. In February 1737 though, he spent the night at <a href="Puckeridge">Puckeridge</a>, with his wife, her maid and a man called Robert Nott. Turpin arranged the meeting by letter, which was intercepted by the authorities. While Turpin eluded his enemies, making his escape to <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a>, the others were arrested on charges of "violent suspicion of being dangerous rogues and robbing upon the highway". They were imprisoned at <a href="Hertford">Hertford</a> gaol, although the women were later acquitted (Nott was released at the next Assize). Although one report late in March suggests, unusually, that Turpin alone robbed a company of <a href="Peddler">higlers</a>, in the same month he was reported to be working alongside two other highwaymen, Matthew King (then, and since, incorrectly identified as <a href="Tom%20King%20%28highwayman%29">Tom King</a>), and Stephen Potter. The trio were responsible for a string of robberies between March and April 1737, which ended suddenly in an incident at Whitechapel, after King (or Turpin, depending upon which report is read) had stolen a horse near Waltham Forest. Its owner, Joseph Major, reported the theft to Richard Bayes, landlord of the Green Man public house at <a href="Leytonstone">Leytonstone</a>. Bayes (who later wrote a biography of Turpin), tracked the horse to the Red Lion at Whitechapel. Major identified the animal, but as it was late evening and the horses had not yet been collected by their "owners", they elected to hold a vigil. John King (Matthew King's brother) arrived late that night, and was quickly apprehended by the party, which included the local constable. John King told him the whereabouts of Matthew King, who was waiting nearby. During the resulting mêlée, Matthew King was wounded by gunfire, and died on 19 May. Potter was later caught, but at his trial was released for lack of evidence against him.

Bayes' statement regarding the death of Matthew King may have been heavily embellished. Several reports, including Turpin's own account, offer different versions of what actually happened on that night early in May 1737; early reports claimed that Turpin had shot King, however by the following month the same newspapers retracted this claim, and stated that Bayes had fired the fatal shot. The shooting of King, however, preceded an event that changed Turpin's life significantly. He escaped to a <a href="Turpin%27s%20Cave">hideaway</a> in Epping Forest, where he was seen by Thomas Morris, a servant of one of the Forest's Keepers. Turpin shot and killed Morris on 4 May with a <a href="carbine">carbine</a> when, armed with pistols, Morris attempted to capture him. The shooting was reported in "<a href="The%20Gentleman%27s%20Magazine">The Gentleman's Magazine</a>":

Several newspapers suggested that on 6 and 7 May, he committed two highway robberies near Epping. Turpin may also have lost his mount; on 7 May Elizabeth King, the wife of Turpin's accomplice, attempted to secure two horses left by Matthew King, at an inn called the Red Lion. The horses were suspected as belonging to "highwaymen" and Elizabeth King was arrested for questioning, but she was later released without charge. Morris's killing unleashed a flood of Turpin reports, and a reward of £200 was offered for his capture.

Sometime around June 1737 Turpin boarded at the Ferry Inn at <a href="Brough%2C%20East%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire">Brough</a>, under the alias of John Palmer (or Parmen). Travelling across the <a href="River%20Humber">River Humber</a> between the <a href="Historic%20counties%20of%20England">historic</a> counties of the <a href="East%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire">East Riding of Yorkshire</a> and <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>, he posed as a horse trader, and often hunted alongside local gentlemen. On 2 October 1738 Turpin shot another man's <a href="cockfighting">game cock</a> in the street. While being rebuked by John Robinson, he then threatened to shoot him also. Three East Riding <a href="Justice%20of%20the%20peace">justices</a> (JPs), <a href="George%20Crowle">George Crowle</a> (<a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> for <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Hull</a>), Hugh Bethell, and Marmaduke Constable, travelled to Brough and took written depositions about the incident. They threatened to <a href="Binding%20over">bind him over</a>, but Turpin refused to pay the required <a href="surety">surety</a>, and was committed to the <a href="House%20of%20Correction">House of Correction</a> at <a href="Beverley">Beverley</a>. Turpin was escorted to Beverley by the parish constable, Carey Gill. He made no attempt at escape; It has been suggested that Turpin may have been depressed about failures in his life.

Robert Appleton, <a href="Clerk%20of%20the%20Peace">Clerk of the Peace</a> for the East Riding, and the man whose account details the above incident, later reported that the three JPs made enquiries as to how "Palmer" had made his money, suspecting that his lifestyle was funded by criminal activities. Turpin claimed that he was a butcher who had fallen into debt, and that he had <a href="wiktionary%3Alevant">levanted</a> from his home in <a href="Long%20Sutton%2C%20Lincolnshire">Long Sutton, Lincolnshire</a>. When contacted, the JP at Long Sutton (a Mr Delamere) confirmed that John Palmer had lived there for about nine months, but that he was suspected of stealing sheep, and had escaped the custody of the local constable. Delamere also suspected that Palmer was a horse-thief and had taken several <a href="Deposition%20%28law%29">depositions</a> supporting his view, and told the three JPs that he would prefer him to be detained. The three JPs now presumed that the case was too serious for Palmer to remain at Beverley House of Correction, and demanded sureties for his appearance at York <a href="Assizes%20%28England%20and%20Wales%29">Assizes</a>. Turpin refused, and so on 16 October he was transferred to <a href="York%20Castle">York Castle</a> in handcuffs.

Horse theft became a <a href="Capital%20punishment">capital offence</a> in 1545, punishable by death. During the 17th and 18th centuries, crimes in violation of property rights were some of the most severely punished; most of the 200 capital statutes were property offences. Robbery combined with violence was "the sort of offence, second only to premeditated murder (a relatively uncommon crime), most likely to be prosecuted and punished to [the law's] utmost rigour". Turpin had stolen several horses while operating under the pseudonym of Palmer. In July 1737 he stole a horse from <a href="Pinchbeck%2C%20Lincolnshire">Pinchbeck</a> in Lincolnshire, and took it to visit his father at Hempstead. When Turpin returned to Brough (stealing three horses along the way) he left the <a href="gelding">gelding</a> with his father. The identity of John Turpin's son was well known, and the horse's identity was soon discovered. On 12 September 1738 therefore, John Turpin was committed to gaol in Essex on charges of horse theft, but following his help in preventing a gaolbreak, the charges were dropped on 5 March 1739. About a month after "Palmer" had been moved to York Castle, Thomas Creasy, the owner of the three horses stolen by Turpin, managed to track them down and recover them, and it was for these thefts that he was eventually tried.
From his cell, Turpin wrote to his brother-in-law, Pompr Rivernall, who also lived at Hempstead. Rivernall was married to Turpin's sister, Dorothy. The letter was kept at the local post office, but seeing the York post stamp Rivernall refused to pay the delivery charge, claiming that he "had no correspondent at York". Rivernall may not have wanted to pay the charge for the letter, or he may have wished to distance himself from Turpin's affairs, and so the letter was moved to the post office at <a href="Saffron%20Walden">Saffron Walden</a> where James Smith, who had taught Turpin how to write while the latter was at school, recognised the handwriting. He alerted JP Thomas Stubbing, who paid the postage and opened the letter. Smith travelled to York Castle and on 23 February identified Palmer as Turpin. He received the £200 (about £ as of 2019) reward originally offered by the Duke of Newcastle following Turpin's murder of Thomas Morris.

Although there was some question as to where the trial should be held—the Duke of Newcastle wanted him tried in London—Turpin was tried at York Assizes. Proceedings began three days after the winter Assizes opened, on 22 March. Turpin was charged with the theft of Creasy's horses: a mare worth three pounds, a foal worth 20 shillings, and a gelding worth three pounds. The <a href="indictment">indictment</a>s stated that the alleged offences had occurred at <a href="Welton%2C%20East%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire">Welton</a> on 1 March 1739, and described Turpin as "John Palmer alias Pawmer alias Richard Turpin ... late of the castle of York in the County of York labourer". Technically the charges were invalid—the offences had occurred at <a href="Heckington">Heckington</a>, not Welton, and the date was also incorrect; the offences were in August 1738.

Presiding over the trial was <a href="William%20Chapple%20%28judge%29">Sir William Chapple</a>, a senior and respected judge in his early sixties. The prosecution was directed by <a href="Queen%27s%20Counsel">King's Counsel</a> Thomas Place and Richard Crowle (brother of George), and proceedings were recorded by a York resident, Thomas Kyll. Turpin had no defence barrister; during this period of English history, those accused had no right to legal representation, and their interests were cared for by the presiding judge. Among the seven witnesses called to testify were Thomas Creasy, and James Smith, the man who had recognised Turpin's handwriting. Turpin offered little in the way of questioning his accusers; when asked if he had anything to ask of Creasy, he replied "I cannot say anything, for I have not any witnesses come this day, as I have expected, and therefore beg of your Lordship to put off my trial 'till another day", and when asked about Smith, he claimed not to know him. When questioned himself, Turpin told the court that he had bought the mare and foal from an inn-keeper near Heckington. He repeated his original story of how he had come to use the pseudonym Palmer, claiming that it was his mother's maiden name. When asked by the judge for his name before he came to Lincolnshire, he said "Turpin". Without leaving the courtroom the jury found Turpin guilty of the first charge of stealing the mare and foal, and following further proceedings, guilty of stealing the gelding. Throughout the trial Turpin had repeatedly claimed that he had not been allowed enough time to form his defence, that proceedings should be delayed until he could call his witnesses, and that the trial should be held at Essex. Before sentencing him, the judge asked Turpin if he could offer any reason why he should not be sentenced to death; Turpin said: "It is very hard upon me, my Lord, because I was not prepar'd for my Defence." The judge replied: "Why was you not? You knew the Time of the Assizes as well as any Person here." Despite Turpin's pleas that he had been told the trial would be held in Essex, the judge replied: "Whoever told you so were highly to blame; and as your country have found you guilty of a crime worthy of death, it is my office to pronounce sentence against you", sentencing him to death.

Before his execution, Turpin frequently received visitors (the gaoler was reputed to have earned £100 from selling drinks to Turpin and his guests), although he refused the efforts of a local clergyman who offered him "serious remonstrances and admonitions". John Turpin may have sent his son a letter, dated 29 March, urging him to "beg of God to pardon your many transgressions, which the thief upon the cross received pardon for at the last hour". Turpin bought a new frock coat and shoes, and on the day before his execution hired five mourners for three pounds and ten shillings (to be shared between them). 

On 7 April 1739, followed by his mourners, Turpin and John Stead (a horse thief) were taken through York by open cart to <a href="Knavesmire">Knavesmire</a>, which was then the city's equivalent of London's <a href="Tyburn%23Tyburn%20gallows">Tyburn gallows</a>. Turpin "behav'd himself with amazing assurance", and "bow'd to the spectators as he passed". He climbed a ladder to the gallows and spoke to his <a href="Hanging">executioner</a>. York had no permanent hangman, and it was the custom to pardon a prisoner on condition that he acted as executioner. On this occasion, the pardoned man was a fellow highwayman, Thomas Hadfield. An account in "The Gentleman's Magazine" for 7 April 1739 notes Turpin's brashness: "Turpin behaved in an undaunted manner; as he mounted the ladder, feeling his right leg tremble, he spoke a few words to the topsman, then threw himself off, and expir'd in five minutes."

The <a href="Hanging%23Short%20drop">short drop</a> method of hanging meant that those executed were killed by slow strangulation, and so Turpin was left hanging until late afternoon, before being cut down and taken to a tavern in Castlegate. The next morning, Turpin's body was buried in the graveyard of <a href="Medieval%20parish%20churches%20of%20York%23Demolished%20medieval%20churches">St George's Church, Fishergate</a>, opposite what is now the <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> <a href="St%20George%27s%20York">St George's Church</a>. On the Tuesday following the burial, the corpse was reportedly stolen by <a href="body-snatching">body-snatchers</a>. The <a href="Resurrectionists%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">theft of cadavers for medical research</a> was a common enough occurrence, and was likely tolerated by the authorities in York. The practice was however unpopular with the general public, and the body-snatchers, together with Turpin's corpse, were soon apprehended by a mob. The body was recovered and reburied, supposedly this time with <a href="quicklime">quicklime</a>. Turpin's body is purported to lie in St George's graveyard, although some doubt remains as to the grave's authenticity.

Some of the Turpin legend can be sourced directly to Richard Bayes' "The Genuine History of the Life of Richard Turpin" (1739), a mixture of fact and fiction hurriedly put together in the wake of the trial, to satisfy a gullible public. The speeches of the condemned, biographies of criminals, and trial literature, were popular genres during the late 17th and early 18th centuries; written for a mass audience and a precursor to the modern novel, they were "produced on a scale which beggars comparison with any period before or since". Such literature functioned as news and a "forum in which anxieties about crime, punishment, sin, salvation, the workings of providence and social and moral transgression generally could be expressed and negotiated."

Bayes' document contains elements of conjecture; for instance, his claim that Turpin was married to a Miss Palmer (and not Elizabeth Millington) is almost certainly incorrect, and the date of Turpin's marriage, for which no documentary evidence has been found, appears to be based solely on Bayes' claim that in 1739 Turpin had married 11 or 12 years earlier. His account of those present during the robberies committed by the Essex Gang often contains names that never appeared in contemporary newspaper reports, suggesting, according to author Derek Barlow, that Bayes embellished his story. Bayes' description of Turpin's relationship with "King the Highwayman" is almost certainly fictional. Turpin may have known Matthew King as early as 1734, and had an active association with him from February 1737, but the story of the "Gentleman Highwayman" may have been created only to link the end of the Essex gang with the author's own recollection of events. Barlow also views the account of the theft of Turpin's corpse, appended to Thomas Kyll's publication of 1739, as "handled with such delicacy as to amount almost to reverence", and therefore of suspect provenance.

No contemporary portrait exists of Turpin, who as a notorious but unremarkable figure was not considered sufficiently important to be immortalised. An engraving in one edition of Bayes' 1739 publication, of a man hiding in a cave, is sometimes supposed to be him, but the closest description that exists is that given by John Wheeler, of "a fresh coloured man, very much marked with the small pox, about five feet nine inches high ... wears a blue grey coat and a light coloured wig". An <a href="E-FIT">E-FIT</a> of Turpin, created from such reports, was published by the Castle Museum in York in 2009.

Turpin is best known for his exploits as a highwayman, but before his execution the only contemporary report of him as such was in June 1737, when a broadsheet entitled "News news: great and wonderful news from London in an uproar or a hue and cry after the Great Turpin, with his escape into Ireland" was published. Although some of his contemporaries became the subject of <a href="chapbook">chapbook</a>s, names such as <a href="James%20Hind">James Hind</a>, <a href="Claude%20Duval">Claude Duval</a> and <a href="John%20Nevison">William Nevison</a>, are not nearly as well-known today as the legend of Dick Turpin, whose fictionalised exploits first began to appear around the turn of the 19th century. It was, however, the story of a fabled ride from London to York that provided the impetus for 19th-century author <a href="William%20Harrison%20Ainsworth">William Harrison Ainsworth</a> to include and embellish the exploit in his 1834 novel "<a href="Rookwood%20%28novel%29">Rookwood</a>". Ainsworth used Turpin as a plot device, describing him in a manner that makes him more lively than the book's other characters. Turpin is introduced with the pseudonym Palmer, and is later forced to escape on his horse, Black Bess. Although fast enough to keep ahead of those in pursuit, Black Bess eventually dies under the stress of the journey. This scene appealed more to readers than the rest of the work, and as Turpin was depicted as a likeable character who made the life of a criminal seem appealing, the story came to form part of the modern legend surrounding Turpin. The artist <a href="Edward%20Hull%20%28watercolourist%29">Edward Hull</a> capitalised on Ainsworth's story, publishing six prints of notable events in Turpin's career.

Ainsworth's tale of Turpin's overnight journey from London to York on his mare Black Bess has its origins in an episode recorded by <a href="Daniel%20Defoe">Daniel Defoe</a>, in his 1727 work "<a href="A%20tour%20thro%27%20the%20whole%20island%20of%20Great%20Britain">A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain</a>". After committing a robbery in Kent in 1676, <a href="John%20Nevison">William Nevison</a> apparently rode to York to establish an alibi, and Defoe's account of that journey became part of folk legend. A similar ride was attributed to Turpin as early as 1808, and was being performed on stage by 1819, but the feat as imagined by Ainsworth (about 200 miles in less than a day) is impossible. Nevertheless, Ainsworth's legend of Black Bess was repeated in works such as "Black Bess or the Knight of the Road", a 254-part <a href="penny%20dreadful">penny dreadful</a> published in 1867–68. In these tales, Turpin was the hero, accompanied by his trusty colleagues Claude Duval, Tom King, and Jack Rann. These narratives, which transformed Turpin from a pockmarked thug and murderer into "a gentleman of the road [and] a protector of the weak", followed a popular cultural tradition of romanticising English criminals. This practice is reflected in the ballads written about Turpin, the earliest of which, "Dick Turpin", would appear to have been published in 1737. Later ballads presented Turpin as an 18th-century <a href="Robin%20Hood">Robin Hood</a> figure: "Turpin was caught and his trial was passed, and for a game cock he died at last. Five hundred pounds he gave so free, all to <a href="Jack%20Ketch">Jack Ketch</a> as a small legacy."

Stories about Turpin continued to be published well into the 20th century, and the legend was also transferred to the stage. In 1845 the playwright <a href="George%20Dibdin-Pitt">George Dibdin-Pitt</a> recreated the most notable "facts" of Turpin's life, and in 1846 <a href="Marie%20Tussaud">Marie Tussaud</a> added a wax sculpture of Turpin to her collection at <a href="Madame%20Tussauds">Madame Tussauds</a>. In 1906 actor <a href="Fred%20Ginnett">Fred Ginnett</a> wrote and starred in the film "Dick Turpin's Last Ride to York". Other silent versions appeared for the silver screen, and some adaptations even moulded Turpin into a figure styled on <a href="Robin%20Hood">Robin Hood</a>. <a href="Sid%20James">Sid James</a> appeared as Turpin in the 1974 <a href="Carry%20On%20%28film%20series%29">Carry On</a> film "<a href="Carry%20On%20Dick">Carry On Dick</a>" and <a href="London%20Weekend%20Television">LWT</a> cast <a href="Richard%20O%27Sullivan">Richard O'Sullivan</a> as Turpin in their eponymous series "<a href="Dick%20Turpin%20%28TV%20series%29">Dick Turpin</a>".

Japanese battleship Musashi

, named after <a href="Musashi%20Province">the former Japanese province</a>, was one of two s built for the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> (IJN), beginning in the late 1930s. The "Yamato"-class ships were the heaviest and most powerfully armed battleships ever constructed, displacing almost fully loaded and armed with nine main guns. Their <a href="Battleship%20secondary%20armament">secondary armament</a> consisted of four triple-<a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s formerly used by the s. They were equipped with six or seven <a href="floatplane">floatplane</a>s to conduct reconnaissance.

Commissioned in mid-1942, "Musashi" was modified to serve as the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of the <a href="Combined%20Fleet">Combined Fleet</a>, and spent the rest of the year <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23W">working up</a>. The ship was transferred to <a href="Chuuk%20Lagoon">Truk</a> in early 1943 and <a href="sortie">sortie</a>d several times that year with the fleet in unsuccessful searches for American forces. She was used to transfer forces and equipment between Japan and various occupied islands several times in 1944. Torpedoed in early 1944 by an American <a href="submarine">submarine</a>, "Musashi" was forced to return to Japan for repairs, during which the navy greatly augmented her <a href="anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft armament</a>. She was present during the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Philippine%20Sea">Battle of the Philippine Sea</a> in June, but did not come in contact with American surface forces. "Musashi" was sunk by an estimated 19 torpedo and 17 bomb hits from American <a href="carrier-based%20aircraft">carrier-based aircraft</a> on 24 October 1944 during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Leyte%20Gulf">Battle of Leyte Gulf</a>. Over half of her crew was rescued. Her wreck was located in March 2015 by a team of researchers employed by <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> co-founder <a href="Paul%20Allen">Paul Allen</a>.

Since the navy anticipated they would be unable to produce as many ships as the United States, the "Yamato"-class ships with their great size and heavy armament were designed to be individually superior to American battleships. "Musashi" had a length of <a href="Length%20between%20perpendiculars">between perpendiculars</a> and <a href="length%20overall">overall</a>. She had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draught</a> of at deep load. she <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> at <a href="Standard%20displacement%23Standard%20displacement">standard load</a> and at deep load. Her crew consisted of 2,500 officers and enlisted men in 1942, and about 2,800 in 1944.

The battleship had four sets of Kampon geared <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s, each of which drove one propeller shaft. The turbines were designed to produce a total of , using steam provided by 12 Kampon <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s, to give her a maximum speed of . She had a stowage capacity of of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a>, giving a range of at a speed of .

"Musashi"s <a href="main%20battery">main battery</a> consisted of nine 45-<a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">calibre</a> <a href="40%20cm/45%20Type%2094">46-centimetre Type 94</a> guns mounted in three triple gun turrets, numbered from front to rear. The guns had a rate of fire of 1.5 to 2 rounds per minute. The ship's <a href="battleship%20secondary%20armament">secondary battery</a> consisted of twelve 60-calibre <a href="15.5%20cm/60%203rd%20Year%20Type%20naval%20gun">15.5-centimetre 3rd Year Type guns</a> mounted in four triple turrets, one each fore and aft of the <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a> and one on each side <a href="amidships">amidships</a>. These had become available once the "Mogami"-class cruisers were rearmed with <a href="20%20cm/50%203rd%20Year%20Type%20naval%20gun"></a> guns. Heavy <a href="anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft defence</a> was provided by a dozen 40-calibre <a href="12.7%20cm/40%20Type%2089%20naval%20gun">127-millimetre (5 in) Type 89</a> <a href="dual-purpose%20gun">dual-purpose gun</a>s in six twin turrets, three on each side of the superstructure. "Musashi" also carried thirty-six <a href="Type%2096%2025%20mm%20AT/AA%20Gun">25-millimetre (1 in) Type 96</a> light <a href="Anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft (AA) guns</a> in triple-gun mounts, all mounted on the superstructure. The ship was also provided with two twin mounts for the <a href="licence-built">licence-built</a> <a href="13.2%20mm%20Hotchkiss%20machine%20gun">Type 93</a> anti-aircraft <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>s, one on each side of the <a href="bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a>.

While the ship was under repair in April 1944, the two 15.5 cm <a href="wing%20turret">wing turret</a>s were removed and replaced with three triple 25 mm gun mounts each. A total of twenty-one triple 25 mm mounts and 25 single mounts were added at that time, giving the ship a light AA armament that numbered one hundred and thirty 25 mm guns.

The ship's <a href="waterline">waterline</a> <a href="belt%20armor">armour belt</a> was negligibly thinner than the Yamato's at thick and angled outwards 20 degrees at the top. Below it was a <a href="strake">strake</a> of armour that ranged in thickness from over the <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a> and machinery spaces respectively; it tapered to a thickness of at its bottom edge. The <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> armour ranged in thickness from . The turrets were protected with an armour plate thick on the face, on the sides, and 270 millimetres on the roof. The <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s of the turrets were protected by armour thick, and the turrets of the 155 mm guns were protected by armour plates. The sides of the <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> were thick and it had a 200-millimetre thick roof. Underneath the magazines were armour plates to protect the ship from <a href="naval%20mine">mine</a> damage. "Musashi" contained 1147 watertight compartments (1065 underneath the armour deck, 82 above) to preserve buoyancy in the event of battle damage.

"Musashi" was fitted with two <a href="aircraft%20catapult">catapults</a> on her <a href="quarterdeck">quarterdeck</a> and could stow up to seven <a href="floatplane">floatplane</a>s in her below-decks <a href="hangar">hangar</a>. The ship operated <a href="Mitsubishi%20F1M">Mitsubishi F1M</a> <a href="biplane">biplane</a>s and <a href="Aichi%20E13A">Aichi E13A</a>1 monoplanes and used a , stern-mounted <a href="crane%20%28machine%29">crane</a> for recovery.

The ship was equipped with four <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a>s, one atop her forward superstructure and one each in her main gun turrets, and another unit atop her rear superstructure. Each gun turret was equipped with an rangefinder. Low-angle fire was controlled by two Type 98 <a href="fire-control%20director">fire-control director</a>s mounted above the rangefinders on the superstructure. Type 94 high-angle directors controlled the 127 mm AA guns, with Type 95 short-range directors for the 25 mm AA guns.

"Musashi" was built with a Type 0 <a href="hydrophone">hydrophone</a> system in her bow, usable only while stationary or at low speed. In September 1942 a <a href="List%20of%20Japanese%20World%20War%20II%20radar%23Shipborne%20radar">Type 21 air-search radar</a> was installed on the roof of the 15-metre rangefinder at the top of the forward superstructure. Two Type 22 surface-search radars were installed on the forward superstructure in July 1943. During repairs in April 1944, the Type 21 radar was replaced by a more modern version, and a Type 13 <a href="early-warning%20radar">early-warning radar</a> was fitted.

To cope with "Musashi"s great size and weight, the construction <a href="slipway">slipway</a> was reinforced, nearby workshops were expanded, and two <a href="Crane%20%28machine%29%23Floating%20crane">floating cranes</a> were built. The ship's <a href="keel">keel</a> was laid down on 29 March 1938 at <a href="Mitsubishi">Mitsubishi</a>'s <a href="Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a> shipyard, and was designated "Battleship No. 2". Throughout construction, a large curtain made of hemp rope weighing prevented outsiders from viewing construction.

<a href="Launch%20%28ship%29">Launching</a> the "Musashi" also presented problems. The ship's thick launch platform, made of nine <a href="Douglas%20fir">Douglas fir</a> planks bolted together, took two years to assemble (from keel-laying in March 1938) because of the difficulty in drilling perfectly straight bolt holes through 4m of fresh timber. The problem of slowing and stopping the massive hull once inside the narrow Nagasaki Harbour was met by attaching of heavy chains on both sides of the hull to create dragging resistance in the water. The launch was concealed by means including a citywide <a href="Civil%20defense">air-raid drill</a> staged on the launch day to keep people inside their homes. "Musashi" was launched on 1 November 1940, coming to a stop only in excess of the hull's expected travel distance across the harbour. The entry of such a large mass into the water caused a <a href="tsunami">tsunami</a>, which swept the harbour and local rivers, flooding homes and capsizing small fishing boats. "Musashi" was <a href="Fitting-out">fitted out</a> at nearby <a href="Sasebo%2C%20Nagasaki">Sasebo</a>, with <a href="Captain%20%28naval%29">Captain</a> <a href="Kaoru%20Arima">Kaoru Arima</a> assigned as her commanding officer.

Towards the end of fitting out, the ship's flagship facilities, including those on the <a href="Ship%27s%20bridge">bridge</a> and in the admiral's <a href="Cabin%20%28ship%29">cabins</a>, were modified to satisfy Combined Fleet's desire to have the ship equipped as the primary flagship of the commander-in-chief, as her sister "Yamato" was too far along for such changes. These alterations, along with improvements in the secondary battery armour, pushed back completion and pre-handover testing of "Musashi" by two months, to August 1942.

"Musashi" was commissioned at Nagasaki on 5 August 1942, and assigned to the 1st Battleship Division together with "Yamato", , and . Beginning five days later, the ship conducted machinery and aircraft-handling trials near <a href="Hashirajima">Hashirajima</a>. Her secondary armament of twelve 127 mm guns, 12 triple 25 mm gun mounts, and four anti-aircraft machine guns was fitted from 3–28 September 1942 at Kure, as well as a Type 21 radar. The ship was <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23W">working up</a> for the rest of the year. Captain Arima was promoted to <a href="rear%20admiral">rear admiral</a> on 1 November.

"Musashi" was assigned to the <a href="Japanese%20Combined%20Fleet">Combined Fleet</a>, commanded by Admiral <a href="Isoroku%20Yamamoto">Isoroku Yamamoto</a>, on 15 January 1943 and sailed for Truk three days later, arriving on 22 January. On 11 February, she replaced her sister ship "Yamato" as the fleet's flagship. On 3 April, Yamamoto left "Musashi" and flew to <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a>, <a href="New%20Britain">New Britain</a> to personally direct <a href="Operation%20I-Go">"Operation "I-Go""</a>, a Japanese aerial offensive in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>. His orders were intercepted and deciphered by <a href="Magic%20%28cryptography%29">Magic</a>, and American <a href="Lockheed%20P-38%20Lightning">Lockheed P-38 Lightning</a> fighters shot down his aircraft and killed him in <a href="Operation%20Vengeance">Operation Vengeance</a> while he was en route from New Britain to Ballale, <a href="Bougainville%20Island">Bougainville</a>. On 23 April, his cremated remains were flown back to Truk and placed in his cabin on board "Musashi".
On 17 May, in response to American <a href="Battle%20of%20Attu">attacks on Attu Island</a>, "Musashi"—together with the carrier , two <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a>s, and nine <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s—<a href="sortie">sortie</a>d to the northern Pacific. When no contact was made with American forces, the ships sailed to Kure on 23 May, where Yamamoto's ashes were taken from the vessel in preparation for a formal <a href="state%20funeral">state funeral</a>. Immediately afterwards, "Musashi"s task force was significantly reinforced to counterattack American naval forces off Attu, but the island was captured before the force could intervene. On 9 June Arima was relieved by captain <a href="Keiz%C5%8D%20Komura">Keizō Komura</a>. On 24 June, while being overhauled at <a href="Yokosuka%20Naval%20Arsenal">Yokosuka Naval Arsenal</a>, "Musashi" was visited by <a href="Emperor%20Hirohito">Emperor Hirohito</a> and high-ranking naval officers. From 1 to 8 July, the ship was fitted with a pair of Type 22 radars at Kure. She sailed for Truk on 30 July and arrived there six days later, where she resumed her position as fleet flagship for Admiral <a href="Mineichi%20Koga">Mineichi Koga</a>.

In mid-October, in response to suspicions of planned American raids on <a href="Wake%20Island">Wake Island</a>, "Musashi" led a large fleet—three carriers, six battleships, and 11 cruisers—to intercept American forces, but failed to make contact and returned to Truk on 26 October. She spent the remainder of 1943 in Truk Lagoon. Captain Komura was promoted to rear admiral on 1 November and transferred to the <a href="3rd%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">3rd Fleet</a> on 7 December as <a href="Chief%20of%20Staff">Chief of Staff</a>, Captain Bunji Asakura assuming command of "Musashi".
The ship remained in Truk Lagoon until 10 February 1944, when she returned to Yokosuka. On 24 February, "Musashi" sailed for <a href="Palau">Palau</a>, carrying one <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a> <a href="battalion">battalion</a> and another of <a href="Special%20Naval%20Landing%20Force">Special Naval Landing Force</a>s and their equipment. After losing most of her deck cargo during a <a href="typhoon">typhoon</a>, she arrived at Palau on 29 February and remained there for the next month. On 29 March, "Musashi" departed Palau under cover of darkness to avoid an expected air raid, and encountered the submarine , which fired six torpedoes at the battleship; five of them missed, but the sixth blew a hole in diameter near the bow, flooding her with 3000 tonnes of water. The torpedo hit killed seven crewmen and wounded another eleven. After temporary repairs, "Musashi" sailed for Japan later that night and arrived at <a href="Kure%20Naval%20Arsenal">Kure Naval Arsenal</a> on 3 April. From 10 to 22 April, she was repaired and her anti-aircraft armament was substantially increased. When she undocked on 22 April, the ship's secondary battery comprised six 15.5 cm guns, twenty-four 12.7 cm guns, one hundred and thirty 25 mm guns, and four 13.2 mm machine guns. She also received new radars (which were still primitive compared to American equipment), and <a href="depth%20charge">depth-charge</a> rails were installed on her <a href="Poop%20deck">fantail</a>.

In May 1944, captain Asakura was promoted to rear admiral and "Musashi" departed Kure for <a href="Okinawa">Okinawa</a> on 10 May, then for <a href="Tawi-Tawi">Tawi-Tawi</a> on 12 May. She was assigned to the <a href="1st%20Mobile%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">1st Mobile Fleet</a>, under the command of <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Jisabur%C5%8D%20Ozawa">Jisaburō Ozawa</a>, with her sister. On 10 June, the battleships departed Tawi-Tawi for <a href="Batjan">Batjan</a> under the command of Vice Admiral <a href="Matome%20Ugaki">Matome Ugaki</a>, in preparation for <a href="Operation%20Kon">Operation Kon</a>, a planned counterattack against the American <a href="Battle%20of%20Biak">invasion of Biak</a>. Two days later, when word reached Ugaki of American attacks on <a href="Saipan">Saipan</a>, his force was diverted to the <a href="Mariana%20Islands">Mariana Islands</a>. After they rendezvoused with Ozawa's main force on 16 June, the battleships were assigned to Vice Admiral <a href="Takeo%20Kurita">Takeo Kurita</a>'s <a href="2nd%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">2nd Fleet</a>. During the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Philippine%20Sea">Battle of the Philippine Sea</a>, "Musashi" was not attacked. Following Japan's disastrous defeat in the battle (also known as the "Great Marianas Turkey Shoot"), the Second Fleet returned to Japan. On 8 July, "Musashi" and her sister embarked 3,522 men and equipment of the Army's <a href="106th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28Japan%29">106th Infantry Regiment</a> of the <a href="49th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">49th Infantry Division</a> and sailed for <a href="Lingga%20Island">Lingga Island</a>, where they arrived on 17 July.

Captain <a href="Toshihira%20Inoguchi">Toshihira Inoguchi</a> relieved Asakura in command of "Musashi" on 12 August 1944 and was promoted to rear admiral on 15 October. Three days later, she sailed for <a href="Brunei%20Bay">Brunei Bay</a>, Borneo, to join the main Japanese fleet in preparation for "Operation "Sho"-1", the counterattack planned against the American landings at Leyte. The Japanese plan called for Ozawa's carrier forces to lure the American carrier fleets north of Leyte so that Kurita's 1st Diversion Force (also known as the Central Force) could enter <a href="Leyte%20Gulf">Leyte Gulf</a> and destroy American forces landing on the island. "Musashi", together with the rest of Kurita's force, departed Brunei for the Philippines on 22 October.

The following day, the submarine torpedoed and sank the heavy cruiser near <a href="Palawan%20%28island%29">Palawan</a>. The destroyer rescued 769 survivors and transferred them to "Musashi" later in the day. On 24 October, while transiting the <a href="Sibuyan%20Sea">Sibuyan Sea</a>, Kurita's ships were spotted by a reconnaissance aircraft from the <a href="fleet%20carrier">fleet carrier</a> . Just over two hours later, the battleship was attacked by eight <a href="Curtiss%20SB2C%20Helldiver">Curtiss SB2C Helldiver</a> <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s from "Intrepid" at 10:27. One bomb struck the roof of Turret No. 1, failing to penetrate. Two minutes later, "Musashi" was struck starboard amidships by a torpedo from a <a href="Grumman%20TBF%20Avenger">Grumman TBF Avenger</a>, also from "Intrepid". The ship took on of water and a 5.5 degree <a href="list%20%28watercraft%29">list</a> to starboard that was later reduced to 1 degree by counterflooding compartments on the opposite side. During this attack two Avengers were shot down.

An hour and a half later, another eight Helldivers from "Intrepid" attacked "Musashi" again. One bomb hit the upper deck and failed to detonate; another hit the port side of the deck and penetrated two decks before exploding above one of the engine rooms. Fragments broke a steam pipe in the engine room and forced its abandonment as well as that of the adjacent boiler room. Power was lost to the port inboard propeller shaft and the ship's speed dropped to . Anti-aircraft fire shot down two Helldivers during this attack. Three minutes later, nine Avengers attacked from both sides of the ship, scoring three torpedo hits on the port side. One hit abreast Turret No. 1, the second flooded a hydraulic machinery room forcing the main turrets to switch over to auxiliary hydraulic pumps, and the third flooded another engine room. More counterflooding reduced the list to one degree to port, but the degree of flooding reduced the ship's forward <a href="freeboard%20%28nautical%29">freeboard</a> by . During this attack, "Musashi" fired "<a href="Beehive%20%28anti-aircraft%20shell%29">sanshikidan</a>" anti-aircraft shells from her main armament; one shell detonated in the middle gun of Turret No. 1, possibly because of a bomb fragment in the barrel, and wrecked the turret's elevating machinery.
At 13:31, the ship was attacked by 29 aircraft from the fleet carriers and . Two <a href="Grumman%20F6F%20Hellcat">Grumman F6F Hellcat</a> fighters <a href="strafe">strafe</a>d the ship's deck and Helldivers scored four more bomb hits near her forward turrets. "Musashi" was hit by four more torpedoes, three of which were forward of Turret No. 1, causing extensive flooding. The ship was now listing one degree to starboard, and had taken on so much water that her bow was now down and her speed had been reduced to . Two hours later nine Helldivers from attacked with <a href="Armor-piercing%20shot%20and%20shell">armour-piercing bombs</a>, scoring four hits. The ship was hit by three more torpedoes, opening up her starboard bow and reducing her speed to . At 15:25, "Musashi" was attacked by 37 aircraft from "Intrepid", the fleet carrier and the <a href="light%20carrier">light carrier</a> . The ship was hit by 13 bombs and 11 more torpedoes during this attack for the loss of three Avengers and three Helldivers. Her speed was reduced to , her main <a href="steering%20engine">steering engine</a> was temporarily knocked out and her <a href="rudder">rudder</a> was briefly jammed 15 degrees to port. Counterflooding reduced her list to six degrees to port from its previous maximum of ten degrees. "Musashi" had been struck by an estimated total of 19 torpedoes and 17 bombs.

Kurita left "Musashi" to fend for herself at 15:30, and encountered her again at 16:21 after reversing course. The ship was headed north, with a list of 10 degrees to port, down at the bow with her <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a> awash. He detailed a heavy cruiser and two destroyers to escort her while frantic efforts were made to correct her list, including flooding another engine room and some boiler rooms. Her engines stopped before she could be <a href="Beaching%20%28nautical%29">beached</a>. At 19:15 her list reached 12 degrees and her crew was ordered to prepare to abandon ship, which they did fifteen minutes later when the list reached 30 degrees. "Musashi" capsized at 19:36 and sank in at . Inoguchi chose to go down with his ship; 1,376 of her 2,399-man crew were rescued. About half of her survivors were evacuated to Japan, and the rest took part in the defence of the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>. The destroyer rescued 635 of "Maya"s survivors from "Musashi".

On October 24, 2006, General Dominador Resos, Jr. (Ret), President of the <a href="Romblon">Romblon</a> Cultural Heritage Association, Inc. (ROCHAI), spearheaded The Commemoration of the Battle of Sibuyan Sea to honor the men who perished during the battle and to recognize the peace that the men had fought for. The event had become an annual multinational commemoration. It was reported that two years later, in 2008, Resos Jr. was in talks with Japanese personalities who were interested in locating the then-undiscovered remains of "Musashi". Believing that it had sunk in one piece, they had plans of refloating the battleship, towing it to a nearby island, and converting it into a <a href="Museum%20ship">war museum</a>. However, the discovery of the wreck and "Musashi"s scattered remains in 2015 would prove that this feat could never be realized.

During the more than 70 years since its sinking, various attempts have been made by shipwreck hunters to locate the wreck of the Japanese battleship but none of them succeeded. "Musashi", like other Japanese warships, did not have its name on its sides, thereby making it more difficult for divers and shipwreck hunters to find her. The research team sponsored by <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> co-founder <a href="Paul%20Allen">Paul Allen</a> eventually found her after eight years of searching for the wreck, going through various historical records in different countries, and deploying the high-tech <a href="yacht">yacht</a> and a <a href="remotely%20operated%20vehicle">remotely operated vehicle</a> to aid them in their search. Allen announced in March 2015 that the team had indeed found "Musashi" under the Sibuyan Sea in the Philippines, some beneath the surface.

The ship had been known to have sunk in one piece but exploded only once it was underwater. Debris was scattered across the ocean floor. The bow section from the number one barbette forward is upright while the stern is upside down. The forward superstructure and funnel is detached from the rest of the ship and lies on its port side. In the live streaming video tour conducted by the expedition team, a mount for the seal of the Imperial Japanese Navy – a <a href="chrysanthemum">chrysanthemum</a> made out of <a href="teak">teak</a>, long rotted away – can be seen amid the debris. The video also showed damage made by U.S. torpedoes, including a warped bow and hits under the ship's main gun. Other items found in the area of the wreck, as well as other features found in it led maritime experts to claim with 90% certainty that the wreck was "Musashi".

To further confirm that the wreck was indeed "Musashi", Shigeru Nakajima, an electrical technician on "Musashi" who claimed that he had survived by jumping overboard after the order to abandon ship, told the AP that he was "certain" of the wreck's identification upon seeing its anchor and the imperial seal mount. He also expressed his gratitude to the expedition team for having found the shipwreck.

The discovery of the wreck beneath the surface of the Sibuyan Sea raised issues when the local government of <a href="Romblon">Romblon</a> (which has jurisdiction over the area where the wreck was found), though Governor Eduardo Firmalo stated that while he welcomed the discovery of the ship, the provincial government, and even the <a href="Philippine%20Coast%20Guard">Philippine Coast Guard</a>, were not aware that Allen and his team had an ongoing expedition in the area. In response to this, the Philippine Coast Guard also stated that foreign-owned vessels need clearance from the Philippine Foreign Affairs Department, the Customs Bureau, and the Immigration Bureau before they can enter Philippine waters.

Although the discovery of the shipwreck is very important to the Japanese people because of the presence of more than 1,000 Japanese sailors' remains aboard the ship, the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20the%20Philippines">National Museum of the Philippines</a> supported the Romblon Government by giving a statement – "Any further activity (pertaining to the shipwreck) shall be governed by established rules and regulations." It pointed out that the wreck site of "Musashi", as stated by the law, is considered an archaeological site under the Philippine territory's jurisdiction, and it is "now giving priority to verifying the discovery, obtaining and sharing key information, facilitating the protection and preservation of the site, and formulating appropriate next steps."

History of the British penny (1714–1901)

The history of the penny of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> and the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> from 1714 to 1901, the period in which the <a href="House%20of%20Hanover">House of Hanover</a> reigned, saw the transformation of the <a href="Penny%20%28British%20pre-decimal%20coin%29">penny</a> from a little-used small silver coin to the bronze piece recognisable to modern-day Britons. All bear the portrait of the monarch on the <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a>; copper and bronze pennies have a depiction of <a href="Britannia">Britannia</a>, the female personification of Britain, on the reverse.

During most of the 18th century, the penny was a small silver coin rarely seen in circulation, and that was principally struck to be used for <a href="Maundy%20money">Maundy money</a> or other royal charity. Beginning in 1787, the chronic shortage of good money resulted in the wide circulation of <a href="conder%20token">private tokens</a>, including large coppers valued at one penny. In 1797 industrialist <a href="Matthew%20Boulton">Matthew Boulton</a> gained a contract to produce official pennies at his <a href="Soho%20Mint">Soho Mint</a> in Birmingham; he struck millions of pennies over the next decade. After that, it was not until 1825 that pennies were struck again for circulation, and the copper penny continued to be issued until 1860.

By the late 1850s, the state of the copper coinage was deemed unsatisfactory, with quantities of worn oversized pieces, some dating from Boulton's day, still circulating. They were replaced by lighter bronze coins beginning in 1860; the "Bun penny", named for the hairstyle of <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> on it, was issued from then until 1894. The final years of Victoria's reign saw the "Veiled head" or "Old head" pennies, which were coined from 1895 until her death in 1901.

At the start of King <a href="George%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain">George I</a>'s reign in 1714, the <a href="Penny%20%28English%20coin%29">English penny</a> had been struck from silver for about a thousand years. The Hanoverian dynasty in Britain began during the time that Sir <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a> was <a href="Master%20of%20the%20Mint">Master of the Mint</a>. Newton had in 1702 considered the issuance of a copper penny, but no action was taken. Silver at this time came to the <a href="Royal%20Mint">Royal Mint</a> only as the by-product of mining for other substances, and from chance deposits and windfalls—the scandal-plagued <a href="South%20Sea%20Company">South Sea Company</a> in 1723 was obliged to send a large quantity of silver bullion to the Mint's premises in the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>. Nevertheless, so little was sent overall that MP <a href="John%20Conduitt">John Conduitt</a>, Newton's successor as Master, wrote in 1730 that since December 1701, "no silver has been imported to the Mint but what was forced thither". Only small quantities of silver pennies were struck in the early years of George's reign; it and the silver twopence were unpopular in any case because of their small size.

The change in dynasty did not affect the form of the silver penny—a 12 mm diameter coin weighing 0.5 gram. George's pennies had the inscription continuing onto the other side with and the date, around the crowned "I". The representation of George was by <a href="John%20Croker%20%28engraver%29">John Croker</a> or his assistant Samuel Bull; they had designed the busts of <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William III</a> and of <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Queen Anne</a> that had appeared on earlier pennies. The Roman numeral I on the coins dated from the reign of <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James II</a>, and was at first intended to denote the King's initial in Latin (IACOBUS) but was kept a Roman numeral when the twopence, <a href="Threepence%20%28British%20coin%29">threepence</a>, and fourpence were given Arabic numerals under William III and <a href="Mary%20II%20of%20England">Mary</a>. Pennies were minted in 1716, 1718, 1720, 1723, 1725, 1726 and 1727, the last of these the date of George's death and of the accession of his son, <a href="George%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George II</a>.

The major purpose for the silver penny in the 18th century was as <a href="Maundy%20money">Maundy money</a>. Most silver pennies after 1727 were likely used for that purpose or for other royal largesse; the mintages were enough to provide for this, but not enough for general circulation. In some years, the Maundy money may have been composed entirely of pennies, though there are accounts of the twopence, threepence, and <a href="Groat%20%28coin%29">groat</a> being used as well. At times, there were gaps in the dating as enough for several years was struck at once, to be held against need. There were enough silver pennies in circulation that Maundy recipients could spend their gifts. By 1727, the price of silver guaranteed that pennies were struck at a loss. When other regal coins began use of a bust showing George II as an older man in 1740–1743, the penny remained unaltered. Brian Robinson, in his book on the Royal Maundy, suggested that a new bust for a coin issued only in small quantities would not have been worth the 12 weeks' work it would have taken a Mint engraver to create new dies. In any event, between 1727 and 1816, silver cost too much for there to be much coinage of it. George II's pennies had a left-facing bust of him and the inscription continuing onto the other side with and the date around the crowned "I". Pennies were minted in 1729, 1731, 1732, 1735, 1737, 1739, 1740, 1743, 1746 and 1750, and between 1752 and 1760. No pennies were issued dated 1733 or 1744, likely because the year in Britain <a href="Calendar%20%28New%20Style%29%20Act%201750">still began on 25 March</a>, and <a href="Maundy%20Thursday">Maundy Thursday</a> did not occur during those twelve-month periods.
Into the reign of King <a href="George%20III%20of%20Great%20Britain">George III</a> (1760–1820), the silver penny continued to be used mostly as a Maundy piece. Pennies similar to those of previous reigns, but bearing George III's head and the inscription , were struck in 1763, 1766, 1770, 1772, 1776, 1779, 1780, 1781, 1784 and 1786. A new bust of the King was introduced to the penny in 1792, and was struck dated that year, 1795, and 1800. The third, laureated bust of the king with an unchanged obverse inscription was on the silver penny in 1817, 1818 and 1820. George III's first reverse, used until 1780, showed the crowned "I" in high relief, with the inscription . A modification was made in 1781, with the relief of the central "I" on the reverse lowered, likely because part of the outline of the I had been visible on the King's head on the other side of the coin. This second reverse, used until 1786, was similar but in lower relief, the "I" being much flatter; the third reverse, used in 1792 only, was completely redesigned with a much smaller "I" under a smaller crown with the inscription running around the crown, with the same legend as before. The fourth reverse, used in 1795 and 1800 was similar to the first but with a redesigned crown. The fifth reverse, used from 1817, showed the crowned "I" with the inscription and the date. From 1817, the diameter of the coin was reduced from 12 to 11 millimetres, although the weight remained the same at .5 grams.

With little silver coined in the second half of the 18th century, the burden of small change fell on the copper coinage, of which the highest denomination before 1797 was the <a href="Halfpenny%20%28British%20pre-decimal%20coin%29">halfpenny</a>. Many official halfpennies were melted down clandestinely and lightweight counterfeits made with the copper. In 1787, the Mint found that at most eight percent of "halfpennies" in circulation were genuine. A withdrawal of the existing copper coinage was deemed impractical due to transport difficulties. The Government would not accept copper coinage for taxes, and the small merchants who accumulated large stocks of real and dubious copper coin sought relief. Areas of the country not near the capital were sometimes short of coppers, since new issues could only be purchased at the Mint's office at the Tower of London, in packets of 5 or 10 shillings. The small change shortage made it difficult, by the late 1780s, for employers to pay workers.
The gap was filled, beginning in 1787, by private minters and companies, who issued <a href="conder%20token">copper halfpenny and penny tokens</a>. Although not money in a legal sense, they served that purpose, and rapidly spread across the country. Many of the manufacturers of these tokens were found in Birmingham, where industrialist <a href="Matthew%20Boulton">Matthew Boulton</a> struck large numbers of tokens and also constructed the <a href="Soho%20Mint">Soho Mint</a>, the first to be powered by steam. He aggressively lobbied for a contract to strike official copper coins. In 1797, the government gave Boulton a contract to strike 480 tonnes of copper pennies and 20 tonnes of copper <a href="Twopence%20%28British%20pre-decimal%20coin%29">twopences</a>. The first official British coins of those denominations to be made of copper, they were also the first official British coins to be struck by steam rather than by muscle power.

The large size of the coins, combined with the thick rim where the inscription was incuse (i.e. punched into the metal rather than raised from it), led to the coins being nicknamed "cartwheels". The design was by Boulton's employee <a href="Conrad%20K%C3%BCchler">Conrad Küchler</a>. The obverse of the cartwheel coinage is a laureated right-facing bust of George III, with the inscription , while the reverse showed <a href="Britannia">Britannia</a> seated on a rock, facing left, holding an olive branch and trident with the inscription . Although Britannia had long appeared on the halfpenny and <a href="Farthing%20%28English%20coin%29">farthing</a>, the 1797 coinage was the first time she was depicted ruling the waves, an allegory for Britain's status as a maritime power. The word may be seen in fine print on the face of the rock just below the shield. Boulton's pennies and twopences were meant to contain their face value in copper, i.e. they weighed one and two ounces each (penny28.3 grams, diameter 36 millimetres). In English measure, the penny was just over 1.4 inches in diameter, so that 17 pennies side by side would measure two feet. Boulton obtained a copy of the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a>'s standard foot to get the measurement right. Even though pennies were struck first, reserving the twopences for later, the existing Soho Mint had trouble stamping such large pieces of copper, and Boulton built a new mint at Soho, where by 1799, each press was striking 60 pennies a minute. The 1,250 tonnes of "cartwheels" struck at Soho between 1797 and 1799 (all pieces were dated 1797) exceeded the total copper coinage by the Royal Mint in the 18th century.
Boulton was given a further contract in 1799, but only halfpennies and farthings were struck then. In 1805, Boulton gained another contract. By then, the price of copper had risen; in 1797, a pound of copper had coined 16 pence of coins, and in 1799 that amount of metal had made 18 pence-worth, but it took 24 of the 1806 pennies to weigh a pound. The pennies were issued dated 1806 or 1807; they weigh 18.9 grams ( ounces) and measure 34 millimetres (one-and-a-third inches) in diameter. These were more conventionally designed, also by Küchler, with a right-facing bust of the King and the same inscription as on the obverse of 1797 pennies. The reverse shows the seated Britannia facing left, with olive branch and trident and the inscription . There is one unique penny coin known which is dated 1808, but this is thought to have been a proof. A total of 150 tonnes of copper were used to make the 1806 and 1807 pennies.

Finding its premises at the Tower of London too cramped and unsuited to the new technology, the Mint moved to a new building on <a href="Tower%20Hill">Tower Hill</a>, and first struck coins there (for the <a href="East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a>) in 1811. The coinage was made by steam power, with equipment supplied by Boulton's firm. At the beginning of the <a href="Great%20Recoinage%20of%201816">Great Recoinage of 1816</a>, only gold and silver coins were produced; the <a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>, <a href="Nicholas%20Vansittart%2C%201st%20Baron%20Bexley">Nicholas Vansittart</a>, deemed there to be enough official coppers in commerce to serve. Thus, it was not until after the death of George III in 1820 and the accession of his son <a href="George%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George IV</a> that the copper coinage was recommenced. Coinage of pennies and halfpennies resumed in 1825 after the first farthings of the new reign were minted in 1821. The new pennies were authorised by an <a href="Order%20in%20Council">Order in Council</a> of 14 November 1825, and were made current by a proclamation of 30 January 1826. George IV's pennies were struck in only three years (1825, 1826, 1827) and most of the final year's mintage is believed to have been sent to Tasmania.
The obverse of George IV's pennies shows a left-facing laureated head engraved by <a href="William%20Wyon">William Wyon</a>. This was the second portrait of George IV, and was adopted after the King expressed a dislike for the one engraved by <a href="Benedetto%20Pistrucci">Benedetto Pistrucci</a>, which was never used on the penny. The penny is inscribed and the date, while the reverse shows a right-facing seated Britannia with a shield and trident, inscribed . The penny at this time weighed 18.8 grams and had a diameter of 34 millimetres, the same as Boulton's 1806–1807 pennies.

The pennies of King <a href="William%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">William IV</a> (1830–1837) are similar to those of his predecessor, also being engraved by William Wyon, based on a model by Sir <a href="Francis%20Chantrey">Francis Chantrey</a>. King William's head faces right, with the obverse inscribed , while the reverse is identical to the George IV penny. Pennies were minted in 1831, 1834 and 1837. An 1836 penny has been reported but not confirmed.

The pennies of <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> (1837–1901) form one of the most intricate denominations of British coinage, both before and after the transition from copper to bronze pennies in 1860. A number of specialist books have been published on the many <a href="Glossary%20of%20numismatics%23V">varieties</a> of Victorian pennies. The final years of the copper penny, from 1839 to 1860, saw a portrait of the Queen by William Wyon, usually dubbed the "Young Head". It had a reverse largely unchanged from King William's but for changing an X to a G, thus became , short for Regina (queen), denoting the fact that the monarch was now a woman. Thus, the legend on Victorian copper pennies was . Copper pennies were issued for all years between 1839 and 1860 except 1840, 1842, 1850, and 1852. The <a href="Birmingham%20Mint">Heaton Mint</a>, of Birmingham, had been founded with equipment from the wound-up Soho Mint. Beginning in the early 1850s, it supplied large quantities of blanks for pennies to the Royal Mint, and at times was called upon to strike pennies, though its <a href="mint%20mark">mint mark</a> H would not appear on pennies until 1874. These contracts were because of the needs of Ireland (where counterfeits and tokens were common) and the colonies; the large quantities struck between 1797 and 1807 by Boulton ensured there were no shortages in England, Scotland and Wales.

By 1857, both the Royal Mint and the public were dissatisfied by the state of the copper coinage. Much of it was worn or defaced by advertisements, and 14 percent of the pennies in commerce were Boulton's 1797 cartwheels. The fact that pennies of different specifications circulated side by side precluded the weighing of quantities of copper coin to ascertain the value. Both sorts of pennies were deemed too heavy for daily use. The copper coins were so heavy that <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> in "<a href="Nicholas%20Nickleby">Nicholas Nickleby</a>" had Mr Mantalini contemplate suicide by drowning himself in the <a href="River%20Thames">Thames</a>, his pockets filled with halfpennies.

<a href="Thomas%20Graham%20%28chemist%29">Thomas Graham</a>, the Master of the Mint, in 1859 persuaded <a href="William%20Gladstone">William Gladstone</a>, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that the state of the copper currency demanded a lighter, more durable replacement. Bronze was selected as harder and less subject to oxidation. It was a material with which the Mint had experience, having recently struck bronze coins for the Canadian colonies, and it had been used in France since 1852. Parliament passed legislation in 1860 that allowed the penny to be struck from an alloy of metals. The act required that Britannia appear on the coin, as the design was felt to symbolise Britain as ruler of the waves, and to omit her would be seen as abandoning that role. The Mint in 1860 awarded a contract for 1,720 tonnes of bronze pennies, halfpennies and farthings to James Watt & Co of Birmingham, a contract that would not be completed until 1863. Heaton's was also called upon to supply dies and coins, especially as Watt's prepared to execute its huge contract.
Although there were calls for a public competition, William Wyon's son, <a href="Leonard%20Charles%20Wyon">Leonard Charles Wyon</a> was chosen to execute the new design. Both the Queen and <a href="Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort">Prince Albert</a> took a keen interest in the work, and repeated visits by Wyon to <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> and <a href="Osborne%20House">Osborne House</a> were necessary before Victoria gave her approval. There is a tale that the Queen returned the penny sent her for final approval by post, but a postman opened the parcel, throwing away the coin in disgust when he realised all that was inside was a penny. The new bronze pieces were made current by a proclamation dated 17 December 1860, and public reaction was positive, both for Wyon's designs and for the weight, which had been halved. The new coins were widely distributed through post offices, and in 1861, the Mint began the recall of the old copper pieces, paying a small premium and for the transport. The old copper coins soon vanished from towns; progress in rural areas was more gradual. The pre-1860 copper penny was demonetised after 1869 in Britain (though accepted at full face value by the Mint until 1873) and in 1877 for the colonies.

The obverse of the new penny read . The Mint had intended to render it with the abbreviation , and some after the coins' release argued it should have done, but Gladstone had intervened to invoke the rule that the last letter of a Latin abbreviation should be doubled to indicate the plural. The coin is dubbed the "Bun Head penny" or "Bun penny" for the Queen's hairstyle. The reverse depicts Britannia, wearing flowing robes, a breastplate and helmet, and grasping a trident. Her right hand grips a shield, on which is seen the combined crosses of the <a href="Union%20Jack">Union Jack</a>. A ship sails out to sea on her right, and a lighthouse, supposedly the old <a href="Smeaton%27s%20Tower">Eddystone Lighthouse</a>, is seen behind her on her left. The denomination, , appears for the first time on the base-metal piece.

There are many varieties of the Bun penny, as several non-identical dies were prepared (especially in 1860) the design was tweaked a number of times over its 35 years, and the dies were sometimes used in different combinations. The 2017 edition of <a href="Spink%20%26amp%3B%20Son">Spink & Son</a>'s "Coins of England & the United Kingdom" chronicles 13 obverses, 14 reverses and a large number of die combinations. Differences include the number of leaves on Victoria's wreath and whether the border is beaded or toothed. An "H" below the date on 1874, 1875, 1876, 1881 and 1882 pennies indicates that the coin was produced at Heaton's in Birmingham. When production at the Royal Mint was stopped for a complete reconstruction in 1882, Heaton's, pursuant to contract, produced 50 tonnes of pennies, halfpennies and farthings. Pennies of the Bun type were issued in all years between 1860 and 1894.
<a href="Joseph%20Edgar%20Boehm">Joseph Edgar Boehm</a>'s "Jubilee head" of the Queen was placed on the gold and silver coinage in 1887 but was not adopted for the bronze, with the Bun head continuing. Boehm's rendering proved unpopular, and in 1893 was replaced with the "Veiled head" or "Old head", by <a href="Thomas%20Brock">Thomas Brock</a>, and engraved by <a href="Chief%20Engraver%20of%20the%20Royal%20Mint">Chief Engraver of the Royal Mint</a> <a href="George%20William%20de%20Saulles">George William de Saulles</a>. The new penny design was introduced in 1895, the new version being authorised by a proclamation dated 11 May of that year. Victoria is seen as an elderly woman, wearing a diadem partially eclipsed by a veil. She wears a necklace with a pendant, an earring, and the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter">Garter</a> Riband with Star. The inscription became , as the title of <a href="Empress%20of%20India">Empress of India</a> had been added to the Queen's titles in 1876. The reverse was modified by de Saulles, with the most significant change the deletion of the ship and lighthouse. The new design was struck each year from 1895 to 1901, the year in which Victoria died. Coins depicting her and dated 1901 continued to be struck until King <a href="Edward%20VII">Edward VII</a>'s coinage was ready in May 1902.

History of the British penny (1901–1970)

The <a href="Penny%20%28British%20pre-decimal%20coin%29">British penny</a> ( of a <a href="pound%20sterling">pound sterling</a>), a large, pre-decimal coin continuing the series of pennies that began about the year 700, was struck intermittently during the 20th century until its withdrawal after 1970. Throughout the period 1901 to 1970, the <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a> ("heads" side) of the bronze coin depicted the monarch who was reigning at the start of the year. The reverse featured an image of <a href="Britannia">Britannia</a> seated with shield, trident, and helm, originally created by <a href="Leonard%20Charles%20Wyon">Leonard Charles Wyon</a> and based on an earlier design for the penny by his father <a href="William%20Wyon">William Wyon</a>. The coins also were used in <a href="dominion">dominion</a>s and British colonies that had not issued their own coins.

The reverse design had in 1895 been modified by <a href="Chief%20Engraver%20of%20the%20Royal%20Mint">Engraver of the Royal Mint</a> <a href="George%20William%20de%20Saulles">George William de Saulles</a>. Following <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>'s death in 1901, de Saulles was called upon to create a design for the obverse featuring <a href="Edward%20VII">Edward VII</a>. This appeared on the penny in 1902, and remained in use until the year of King Edward's death, 1910. An obverse design by Sir <a href="Bertram%20Mackennal">Bertram Mackennal</a> depicting <a href="George%20V">George V</a> went into use in 1911, and remained with some modification until the year of the King's death, 1936. No pennies were produced for commerce in 1933, as there were a sufficient number in circulation. At least seven were struck that year, mostly for placement beneath foundation stones and in museums; they are valuable today. <a href="Edward%20VIII">Edward VIII</a>'s short reign is only represented by a single <a href="pattern%20coin">pattern coin</a>, dated 1937. That year, a new obverse design depicting <a href="George%20VI">George VI</a> by <a href="Humphrey%20Paget">Humphrey Paget</a> went into use. During the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> period of 1941 to 1943, pennies were struck only for the colonies; these are all dated 1940, the most recent year of production for the United Kingdom. After the war, demand for the penny began to diminish. Most of the 1950 and 1951 pieces were sent to Bermuda, with many retrieved from circulation and repatriated by British coin dealers because of their relative scarcity.

Although commerce did not require them, pennies bearing the likeness of <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a> were minted in 1953 in sets sold to the public, using an obverse design by <a href="Mary%20Gillick">Mary Gillick</a>. One 1954 penny was struck, for internal Mint purposes. By 1961, new pennies were needed again for circulation, and were produced in large numbers. The officials who planned decimalisation in the 1960s did not favour keeping the large bronze penny, whose value had been eroded by inflation. The last for circulation were dated 1967—a final <a href="proof%20set">proof set</a> was dated 1970. The old penny quickly went out of use after <a href="Decimal%20Day">Decimal Day</a>, 15 February 1971 - there was no exact decimal equivalent, and the slogan "use your old pennies in sixpenny lots" explained that pennies and "threepenny bits" were only accepted in shops if the total value was six old pence (exactly 2 1/2 new pence). The old penny was demonetised on 31 August of that year.

Following the death of <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> on 22 January 1901, officials at the Royal Mint planned for new coins, to bear the image of her son and successor, <a href="Edward%20VII">Edward VII</a>. New coin designs had been introduced in the 1890s, and Mint officials believed the British people wanted as few changes to the coinage as possible. Thus, it was decided not to alter the reverses of the three bronze coins (the penny, <a href="Halfpenny%20%28British%20pre-decimal%20coin%29">halfpenny</a> and <a href="Farthing%20%28British%20coin%29">farthing</a>), as a new portrait of the Queen had been introduced in 1895. At that time, the <a href="Chief%20Engraver%20of%20the%20Royal%20Mint">Engraver of the Royal Mint</a>, <a href="George%20William%20de%20Saulles">George William de Saulles</a>, had modified <a href="Leonard%20Charles%20Wyon">Leonard Charles Wyon</a>'s depiction of <a href="Britannia">Britannia</a> on the reverse of the bronze coins—the lighthouse and sailing ship that had flanked her were removed. De Saulles was tasked with creating a depiction of Edward for the King's new coinage. The Mint continued to strike coins depicting Victoria, dated 1901, until the King's coinage was ready in May 1902.

The King sat for de Saulles twice, in February and June 1901, and the engraver also used a drawing of Edward by court painter <a href="Emil%20Fuchs%20%28artist%29">Emil Fuchs</a>. The unadorned bust of the King that resulted is in low <a href="relief">relief</a>, as de Saulles sought a coin that would be easy for the Royal Mint to strike. Even so, the relatively large size of the head caused metal flow problems for the penny once issued, resulting in "ghosting", a faint outline of the obverse design visible on the reverse. On 20 August 1901, the Mint received confirmation that the de Saulles bust of Edward would be used on all coins. The new bronze coins were made current by a proclamation dated 10 December 1901, effective 1 January 1902.

Edward's pennies are to the same standard as the final Victorian issues: 95 percent copper, 4 percent tin and 1 percent zinc, and, like all bronze pennies from 1860 until 1970, they weigh an average of and have a diameter of 1.2 inches (30.81 mm). The head faces right on the Edward VII coins, with the inscription . The reverse shows the seated <a href="Britannia">Britannia</a> surrounded by , with the date at the bottom of the coin; this design remained largely unchanged until the coin's demise after 1970. Pennies were struck with Edward's bust from 1902 to 1910. There are two <a href="Glossary%20of%20numismatics%23V">varieties</a> on 1902-dated pennies, "high tide" and "low tide", due to a decision to raise the apparent water level around Britannia.

The death of de Saulles in 1903 had led to the abolition of the post of Engraver, and coins for George V, who took the throne on Edward's death in 1910, were subject to a design competition won by <a href="Bertram%20Mackennal">Bertram Mackennal</a>, who also prepared the medal for <a href="Coronation%20of%20George%20V%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">the Coronation</a>. The King apparently liked his work, as he was appointed a <a href="Member%20of%20the%20Royal%20Victorian%20Order">Member of the Royal Victorian Order</a> in 1911 and knighted in 1921. The inscription around the left-facing bust reads , while no significant change was made to the reverse design. The new bronze coins were made current by proclamation dated 28 November 1910, effective 1 January 1911.

In addition to those struck at the Royal Mint, in 1912, 1918 and 1919 some pennies were produced at the <a href="Birmingham%20Mint">Heaton Mint</a> in <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, and are identified by an "H" <a href="mint%20mark">mint mark</a> to the left of the date. In 1918 and 1919 some were produced at the Kings Norton Metal Co. Ltd, also in Birmingham, and have a "KN" there instead. Both firms also provided blanks to the Royal Mint for striking into pennies from 1912 to 1919. This was due to high demand for small change, initially caused by the 1911 implementation of the <a href="National%20Insurance%20Act">National Insurance Act</a> by the <a href="H.%20H.%20Asquith">Asquith</a> government, and thereafter by the war years. Also feeding the demand for pennies were automatic slot machines, a trend noticed as early as 1898. To reduce the number of worn pieces in commerce, the Royal Mint had in 1908 agreed to accept the return of worn pre-1895 pennies and halfpennies through banks and post offices, and from 1922, pieces dated 1860 to 1894 would be redeemed in any condition, though they remained acceptable in circulation. The pre-1860 copper penny had been demonetised after 1869 in Britain (though accepted at full face value by the Mint until 1873) and in 1877 for the colonies.

King George's pennies were produced in the same alloy as before until 1922, but the following year the composition of bronze coins was set at 95.5 percent copper, 3 percent tin, and 1.5 percent zinc, although the weight remained at and the diameter 1.2 inches (31 millimetres). This alloy was slightly more malleable; the lessened force needed to strike pennies helped minimise ghosting. No pennies were struck for the years 1923, 1924 or 1925; this was due to lack of demand as the interwar years saw alternating gluts and shortages of pennies. In 1928, the King's portrait was reduced in size, effectively eliminating the ghosting problem. The inscription around the three variations of the left-facing head remained , while Britannia remained on the reverse, as before, though that design was slightly modified in 1922.

By the end of George's reign, in 1936, the bronze penny, which had felt lighter in weight compared with older coppers when the alloy was first used for it in 1860, was regarded as weighty and cumbersome, the heaviest bronze coin in circulation in Europe. The weight when in bulk caused problems for business; the London Passenger Transport Board received 6,000 tonnes of pennies, halfpennies and farthings a year. A reduction of size for the penny was deemed impractical, given the time it would take to recoin the 3,000,000,000 pennies in circulation, and because many automatic machines that took pennies would have to be reconfigured. The major response would be the 1937 debut of the <a href="Threepence%20%28British%20coin%29%23Brass%20vs%20silver%20threepences">brass threepence coin</a>. This twelve-sided piece was introduced since threepence worth of pennies or halfpennies was heavy and inconvenient, and <a href="Threepence%20%28British%20coin%29%23Change%20of%20role">the silver threepenny bit</a> was deemed too small.
There was no need for the Mint to produce any pennies in 1933 because there was no commercial demand, and it possessed ample stocks from prior years in storage. There was a custom at that time for the King to place a set of coins of the current year under the foundation stone of important new buildings, and the Mint struck three 1933 pennies for this purpose, also one each for its own museum and for the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>, and at least two others. The result was a rarity that people thought might turn up in their pocket change, and that is probably the best-known British rare coin.
The precise number struck was not recorded at the time; seven are known to exist. One of the 1933 pennies sold in 2016 for US $193,875 (£149,364 at the time). The known 1933 pennies are to be found in the Royal Mint Museum, the British Museum, under the <a href="Senate%20House%2C%20London">Senate House</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20London">University of London</a> (placed there by King George in 1933), with three now in private collections, and one that was stolen, its whereabouts unknown. The missing coin was placed in 1933 under the foundation stone of <a href="St%20Cross%20Church%2C%20Middleton">Church of St Cross, Middleton</a>, <a href="Leeds">Leeds</a>; it was stolen in August 1970 during the church's reconstruction, by thieves who managed to remove the set of coins from beneath the church. To prevent possible further theft, <a href="John%20Moorman">John Moorman</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Ripon%20%28modern%20diocese%29">Bishop of Ripon</a>, ordered that the 1933 penny placed under St Mary's Church, Hawksworth Wood, Kirkstall, Leeds, be unearthed and sold, which it was. As far as is known, the penny under Senate House is still in place. Two others in private hands were sold at auctions in 1969 and 2016 respectively.

Four <a href="pattern%20coins">pattern coins</a> were also made, bearing similar designs to official coins but prepared by sculptor <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Lavrillier">André Lavrillier</a> at the Royal Mint's request. These were rejected by the Standing Committee on Coins, Medals and Decorations in December 1932. One sold at auction on 4 May 2016 for £72,000.

No coins of King <a href="Edward%20VIII%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Edward VIII</a> (1936) were officially issued, but a penny does exist, dated 1937. It is a pattern coin, one produced for royal approval which it would probably have been due to receive about the time that the King <a href="Abdication%20of%20Edward%20VIII">abdicated</a>. The obverse, by <a href="Humphrey%20Paget">Humphrey Paget</a>, shows a left-facing portrait of the King, who considered this to be his best side, and wished to break the tradition of alternating with each change of reign the direction in which the monarch faces on coins. The inscription on the obverse is .

When the Royal Mint's Advisory Committee were considering the question of new designs for King Edward's coinage, they did not favour a new look for the penny. Rather, they sought the return of the lighthouse and ship, seen in the distance on either side of Britannia on pre-1895 pennies, but with the sailing ship seen on Victorian pennies replaced with a modern warship. Officials felt this too aggressive at a delicate international time, and the ship was not restored, but the lighthouse was placed on Edward's patterns, and would be kept on the penny until its abolition after 1970.

King <a href="George%20VI%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George VI's</a> new coins were made current by a proclamation dated 18 March 1937, which went into force immediately. Although the customary Britannia motif was retained for the penny, the halfpenny and farthing were given their own designs.

George's pennies (1937–1952) have a left-facing bust of him, also by Paget, with the inscription (to 1948) , and (from 1949) , removing the Latin abbreviation for "Emperor of India" after that nation had gained independence. Pennies were produced for circulation dated 1937–1940, and 1944–1951, although when necessary pennies were produced for the colonies in 1941–1943 using the 1940 dies. These went principally to <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> and the <a href="British%20West%20Indies">British West Indies</a>.

Although the 2000 edition of the Coincraft catalogue of British coins says the wartime pause was due to a surplus of pennies, numismatist Kerry Rodgers, in his 2016 article on the currency emergency in Fiji during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, cited a colonial legislative record to the effect that it was to conserve copper for munitions. Beginning with the 1942 production of 1940-dated pennies, the composition was altered, as tin was a critical war material, rare because most of it came from <a href="Malay%20Peninsula">Malaya</a>, so pennies from then until later in 1945 are 97 percent copper, 0.5 percent tin, and 2.5 percent zinc. Such coins tarnish to a colour different than the prewar coins, and they were treated with <a href="sodium%20thiosulphate">sodium thiosulphate</a> to give them a darker tone. That substance, dubbed "hypo", had been used to darken all 1934 pennies before issue and most of the 1935 mintage, "Hypo" would be used again in 1946, discolouring the coins to discourage the hoarding of new pennies. Although the prewar alloy was restored in 1945, the Mint reversed itself in 1959, made pennies out of that wartime composition for the remainder of the coin's pre-decimal history without chemical treatment, and continued its use for the new decimal bronze pieces. 

By the late 1940s, demand for pennies was falling in Britain, likely due to the popularity of the lighter, more convenient, brass threepence coin. which weighed less than a quarter of the same value in bronze coins. The immediate aftermath of the war had seen a strong demand for pennies until January 1949, when it dropped off, and in May of that year, the Royal Mint stopped the coin's production. Officials concluded that the fall in demand was permanent due to inflation; its purchasing power was minimal, and many automatic machines no longer took it. The Royal Mint redeemed surplus coppers from the banks for melting beginning in 1951, and by the end of the decade, some £1.2 million worth had been removed from circulation.

The 1950 and 1951 circulation pennies were only produced for the colonies as none were needed in Britain. During 1956, the entire 1950 mintage (still held in stock in Britain) and three-quarters of the 1951 production were sent to Bermuda. Both mintages were low compared with earlier George VI pennies, and London dealers descended on the islands, offering a pound a coin. Collecting coins by date (especially the penny) became popular in the early 1960s; after many bold claims about the investment potential of the 1951 penny were made, the coin acquired something of a cult status. One 1952 penny believed to be unique was struck by the Royal Mint.

The series of pennies worth of a pound concludes with the pre-<a href="Decimal%20Day">decimalisation</a> issues for Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a>. No major change was made to the reverse designs of the penny or other bronze coins with the new reign, and her coins were made current by a proclamation of 25 November 1952, effective 1 January 1953. No pennies were struck for circulation in 1953, the only extant denomination between the farthing and <a href="half%20crown%20%28British%20coin%29">half crown</a> not to see a circulation issue. This was because of the large number of pennies in circulation. Specimen sets, including the penny, were issued for <a href="Coronation%20of%20Elizabeth%20II">the Queen's Coronation</a> that year, with the obverse of each coin inscribed around the right-facing bust of the Queen by <a href="Mary%20Gillick">Mary Gillick</a>. These were not issued for circulation, but as the specimen sets were sold for only a slight advance on face value, many were later broken open and spent. In all subsequent mintings of the penny, the inscription was . The deletion of the Latin for "Queen of all the Britains" in favour of designating her simply as "Queen" was due to the changing nature of the <a href="British%20Commonwealth">British Commonwealth</a>, which by then included some republics.

One 1954 penny is known, struck for die-testing purposes at the Royal Mint, and intended for melting, but recovered from circulation. By the end of the 1950s, the price of metal ensured that every bronze coin was struck at a loss; the Mint hoped for a reduction in size, and the demonetisation of the farthing at the end of 1960 helped clear the way for such a scheme. It was not until 1961 that there was a need for more pennies to be minted, and production continued each year in very large numbers until the final pre-decimal pennies for circulation, dated 1967, were coined.

The old bronze penny was slated for elimination as decimal currency was planned in the 1960s. It continued to be struck after 1967, still bearing that date. The 97 percent copper, 0.5 percent tin, 2.5 percent zinc alloy was used again for the 1960s pennies. Finally, there was an issue of proof quality coins dated 1970 for collectors, to bid farewell to a denomination which had served the country well for 1200 years. The longstanding depiction of Britannia on the penny was translated by sculptor <a href="Christopher%20Ironside">Christopher Ironside</a> to the post-decimal fifty-pence coin.

The <a href="Decimal%20Currency%20Board">Decimal Currency Board</a> had anticipated the need for a transition of up to 18 months after Decimal Day, 15 February 1971, but the "old penny" quickly vanished from circulation, and it was made no longer legal tender after 31 August 1971. It had been the last survivor of the three bronze coins, as the halfpenny had been withdrawn in 1969. With decimalisation the <a href="Penny%20%28British%20decimal%20coin%29">new penny</a> carried a value of 1/100 of a pound.

Weird Tales

Weird Tales is an American <a href="fantasy">fantasy</a> and <a href="horror%20fiction">horror fiction</a> <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a> founded by J. C. Henneberger and J. M. Lansinger in late 1922. The first issue, dated March 1923, appeared on newsstands February 18. The first editor, <a href="Edwin%20Baird">Edwin Baird</a>, printed early work by <a href="H.%20P.%20Lovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a>, <a href="Seabury%20Quinn">Seabury Quinn</a>, and <a href="Clark%20Ashton%20Smith">Clark Ashton Smith</a>, all of whom would go on to be popular writers, but within a year the magazine was in financial trouble. Henneberger sold his interest in the publisher, Rural Publishing Corporation, to Lansinger and refinanced "Weird Tales", with <a href="Farnsworth%20Wright">Farnsworth Wright</a> as the new editor. The first issue under Wright's control was dated November 1924. The magazine was more successful under Wright, and despite occasional financial setbacks it prospered over the next fifteen years. Under Wright's control the magazine lived up to its subtitle, "The Unique Magazine", and published a wide range of unusual fiction.

Lovecraft's <a href="Cthulhu%20Mythos">Cthulhu mythos</a> stories first appeared in "Weird Tales", starting with "<a href="The%20Call%20of%20Cthulhu">The Call of Cthulhu</a>" in 1928. These were well-received, and a group of writers associated with Lovecraft wrote other stories set in the same milieu. <a href="Robert%20E.%20Howard">Robert E. Howard</a> was a regular contributor, and published several of his <a href="Conan%20the%20Barbarian">Conan the Barbarian</a> stories in the magazine, and Seabury Quinn's series of stories about <a href="Jules%20de%20Grandin">Jules de Grandin</a>, a detective who specialized in cases involving the supernatural, was very popular with the readers. Other well-liked authors included <a href="Nictzin%20Dyalhis">Nictzin Dyalhis</a>, <a href="E.%20Hoffmann%20Price">E. Hoffmann Price</a>, <a href="Robert%20Bloch">Robert Bloch</a>, and <a href="H.%20Warner%20Munn">H. Warner Munn</a>. Wright published some <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a>, along with the fantasy and horror, partly because when "Weird Tales" was launched there were no magazines specializing in science fiction, but he continued this policy even after the launch of magazines such as "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>" in 1926. <a href="Edmond%20Hamilton">Edmond Hamilton</a> wrote a good deal of science fiction for "Weird Tales", though after a few years he used the magazine for his more fantastic stories, and submitted his <a href="space%20opera">space opera</a>s elsewhere.

In 1938 the magazine was sold to William Delaney, the publisher of "<a href="Short%20Stories%20%28magazine%29">Short Stories</a>", and within two years Wright, who was ill, was replaced by <a href="Dorothy%20McIlwraith">Dorothy McIlwraith</a> as editor. Although some successful new authors and artists, such as <a href="Ray%20Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a> and <a href="Hannes%20Bok">Hannes Bok</a>, continued to appear, the magazine is considered by critics to have declined under McIlwraith from its heyday in the 1930s. "Weird Tales" ceased publication in 1954, but since then numerous attempts have been made to relaunch the magazine, starting in 1973. The longest-lasting version began in 1988 and ran with an occasional hiatus for over 20 years under an assortment of publishers. In the mid-1990s the title was changed to "Worlds of Fantasy & Horror" because of licensing issues, with the original title returning in 1998. As of 2018, the most recent published issue was dated Spring 2014.

The magazine is regarded by historians of fantasy and science fiction as a legend in the field, with <a href="Robert%20Weinberg%20%28author%29">Robert Weinberg</a>, author of a history of the magazine, considering it "the most important and influential of all fantasy magazines". Weinberg's fellow historian, <a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28writer%29">Mike Ashley</a>, is more cautious, describing it as "second only to "<a href="Unknown%20%28magazine%29">Unknown</a>" in significance and influence", adding that "somewhere in the imagination reservoir of all U.S. (and many non-U.S.) genre-fantasy and horror writers is part of the spirit of "Weird Tales"".

In the late 19th century, popular magazines typically did not print fiction to the exclusion of other content; they would include non-fiction articles and poetry as well. In October 1896, the <a href="Frank%20Munsey">Frank A. Munsey</a> company's "<a href="Argosy%20%28magazine%29">Argosy</a>" magazine was the first to switch to printing only fiction, and in December of that year it changed to using cheap wood-pulp paper. This is now regarded by magazine historians as having been the start of the <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a> era. For years pulp magazines were successful without restricting their fiction content to any specific genre, but in 1906 Munsey launched "<a href="Railroad%20Magazine">Railroad Man's Magazine</a>", the first title that focused on a particular niche. Other titles that specialized in particular fiction genres followed, starting in 1915 with "<a href="Detective%20Story%20Magazine">Detective Story Magazine</a>," with "<a href="Western%20Story%20Magazine">Western Story Magazine</a>" following in 1919. <a href="Weird%20fiction">Weird fiction</a>, <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a>, and <a href="fantasy">fantasy</a> all appeared frequently in the pulps of the day, but by the early 1920s there was still no single magazine focused on any of these genres, though "<a href="The%20Thrill%20Book">The Thrill Book</a>", launched in 1919 by <a href="Street%20%26amp%3B%20Smith">Street & Smith</a> with the intention of printing "different", or unusual, stories, was a near miss.

In 1922, J. C. Henneberger, the publisher of "<a href="College%20Humor%20%28magazine%29">College Humor</a>" and "The Magazine of Fun", formed Rural Publishing Corporation of Chicago, in partnership with his former fraternity brother, J. M. Lansinger. Their first venture was "<a href="Detective%20Tales">Detective Tales</a>", a pulp magazine that appeared twice a month, starting with the October 1, 1922 issue. It was initially unsuccessful, and as part of a refinancing plan Henneberger decided to publish another magazine that would allow him to split some of his costs between the two titles. Henneberger had long been an admirer of <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>, so he created a fiction magazine that would focus on horror, and titled it "Weird Tales".

Henneberger chose <a href="Edwin%20Baird">Edwin Baird</a>, the editor of "Detective Tales", to edit "Weird Tales"; <a href="Farnsworth%20Wright">Farnsworth Wright</a> was <a href="first%20reader">first reader</a>, and <a href="Otis%20Adelbert%20Kline">Otis Adelbert Kline</a> also worked on the magazine, assisting Baird. Payment rates were low, usually between a quarter and a half cent per word; the budget went up to one cent per word for the most popular writers. Sales were initially poor, and Henneberger soon decided to change the format from the standard pulp size to <a href="bedsheet">large pulp</a>, to make the magazine more visible. This had little long-term effect on sales, though the first issue at the new size, dated May 1923, was the only one that first year to sell out completely—probably because it contained the first instalment of a popular serial, "The Moon Terror", by A.G. Birch.

The magazine lost a considerable amount of money under Baird's editorship: after thirteen issues, the total debt was over $40,000. In the meantime, "Detective Tales" had been retitled "Real Detective Tales" and was making a profit, as was "College Humor". Henneberger decided to sell both magazines to Lansinger and invest the money in "Weird Tales". This did not address the $40,000 in debts, much of which was owed to the magazine's printer. The printing company was owned by B. Cornelius, who agreed to Henneberger's suggestion that the debt should be converted to a majority interest in a new company, Popular Fiction Publishing. This did not eliminate all of the magazine's debts, but it meant that "Weird Tales" could continue to publish, and perhaps return to profitability. Cornelius agreed that if the magazine ever became profitable enough to repay him the $40,000 he had been owed, he would give up his shares in the company. Cornelius became the company treasurer; the business manager was William (Bill) Sprenger, who had been working for Rural Publishing. Henneberger had hopes of eventually refinancing the debt with the help of another printer, Hall Printing Company, owned by Robert Eastman.

Baird stayed with Lansinger, so Henneberger wrote to <a href="H.%20P.%20Lovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a>, who had sold some stories to "Weird Tales", to see if he would be interested in taking the job. Henneberger offered ten weeks advance pay, but made it a condition that Lovecraft move to Chicago, where the magazine was headquartered. Lovecraft described Henneberger's plans in a letter to <a href="Frank%20Belknap%20Long">Frank Belknap Long</a> as "a brand-new magazine to cover the field of Poe-Machen shudders". Lovecraft did not wish to leave New York, where he had recently moved with his new bride; his dislike of cold weather was another deterrent. He spent several months considering the offer in mid-1924 without making a final decision, with Henneberger visiting him in Brooklyn more than once, but eventually either he declined or Henneberger simply gave up. By the end of the year Wright had been hired as the new editor of "Weird Tales". The last issue under Baird's name was a combined May/June/July issue, with 192 pages—a much thicker magazine than the earlier issues. It was assembled by Wright and Kline, rather than Baird.

Henneberger gave Wright full control of "Weird Tales", and did not get involved with story selection. In about 1921, Wright had begun to suffer from <a href="Parkinson%27s%20disease">Parkinson's disease</a>, and over the course of his editorship the symptoms grew gradually worse. By the end of the 1920s he was unable to sign his name, and by the late 1930s Bill Sprenger was helping him get to work and back home. The first issue with Wright as editor was dated November 1924, and the magazine immediately resumed a regular monthly schedule, with the format changing back to pulp again. The pay rate was initially low, with a cap of half a cent per word until 1926, when the top rate was increased to one cent per word. Some of Popular Fiction Publishing's debts were paid off over time, and the highest pay rate eventually rose to one and a half cents per word. The magazine's cover price was high for the time. <a href="Robert%20Bloch">Robert Bloch</a> recalled that "in the late Twenties and Thirties of this century...at a time when most pulp periodicals sold for a dime, its price was a quarter". Although Popular Fiction Publishing continued to be based in Chicago, the editorial offices were in Indianapolis for a while, at two separate addresses, but moved to Chicago towards the end of 1926. After a short period on <a href="Broadway%20%28Chicago%29">North Broadway</a>, the office moved to 840 <a href="Michigan%20Avenue%20%28Chicago%29">North Michigan Avenue</a>, where it would remain until 1938.

In 1927, Popular Fiction Publishing issued Birch's "The Moon Terror", one of "Weird Tales" more popular serials, as a hardcover book, including three other stories from the magazine's first year. One of the stories, "An Adventure in the Fourth Dimension", was by Wright himself. The book sold poorly, and it remained on offer in the pages of "Weird Tales", at reduced prices, for twenty years. It was at one point provided as a bonus to readers who subscribed. In 1930 Cornelius launched a companion magazine, "<a href="Oriental%20Stories">Oriental Stories</a>", but the magazine was not a success, though it managed to last for over three years before Cornelius gave up. Another financial blow occurred in late 1930 when a bank failure froze most of the magazine's cash. Henneberger changed the schedule to bimonthly, starting with the February/March 1931 issue; six months later, with the August 1931 issue, the monthly schedule returned. Two years later "Weird Tales"' bank was still having financial problems, and payment to authors was being substantially delayed.

The <a href="Great%20Depression%20in%20the%20United%20States">Depression</a> also hit the Hall Printing Company, which Henneberger had been hoping would take over the debt from Cornelius; Robert Eastman, the owner of Hall, at one point was unable to meet payroll. Eastman died in 1934, and with him went Henneberger's plans for recovering control of "Weird Tales". The magazine advertised in the early science fiction pulps, usually highlighting one of the more science-fictional stories. Often the advertised story was by <a href="Edmond%20Hamilton">Edmond Hamilton</a>, who was popular in the sf magazines. Wright also sold hardcovers of books by some of his more popular authors, such as Kline, in the pages of "Weird Tales". Although the magazine was never greatly profitable, Wright was paid well. <a href="Robert%20Weinberg%20%28author%29">Robert Weinberg</a>, author of a history of "Weird Tales", records a rumor that Wright was unpaid for much of his work on the magazine, but according to <a href="E.%20Hoffman%20Price">E. Hoffmann Price</a>, a close friend of Wright's who occasionally read manuscripts for him, "Weird Tales" was paying Wright about $600 a month in 1927.

Cornelius retired in 1938, and Popular Fiction Publishing was sold to William J. Delaney, who was the publisher of "<a href="Short%20Stories%20%28magazine%29">Short Stories</a>", a successful general fiction pulp magazine based in New York. Sprenger and Wright both received a share of the stock from Cornelius; Sprenger did not remain with the company but Wright moved to New York and stayed on as editor. Henneberger's share of Popular Fiction Publishing was converted to a small interest in the new company, Weird Tales, Inc., a subsidiary of Delaney's Short Stories, Inc. Dorothy McIlwraith, the editor of "Short Stories," became Wright's assistant, and over the next two years Delaney tried to increase profits by adjusting the page count and price. An increase from 144 pages to 160 pages starting with the February 1939 issue, along with the use of cheaper (and hence thicker) paper, made the magazine thicker, but this failed to increase sales. In September 1939 the page count went down to 128, and the price was cut from 25 cents to 15 cents. From January 1940 the frequency was reduced to bimonthly, a change which stayed in effect until the end of the magazine's run fourteen years later. None of these changes had the intended effect, and sales continued to languish. In March 1940, Wright left and was replaced by McIlwraith as editor; histories of the magazine differ as to whether he was fired because of poor sales, or quit because of his health—he was by now suffering from Parkinson's so severely that he had trouble walking unassisted. Wright then had an operation to reduce the pain with which he suffered, but never fully recovered. He died in June of that year.

McIlwraith's first issue was dated April 1940. She was assisted by Lamont Buchanan, who worked for her as associate editor and art editor for both "Weird Tales" and "Short Stories". <a href="August%20Derleth">August Derleth</a> also provided assistance and advice, although he had no formal connection with the magazine. Most of McIlwraith's budget went to "Short Stories", since that was the more successful magazine; the payment rate for fiction in "Weird Tales" by 1953 was one cent per word, well below the top rates of other science fiction and fantasy magazines of the day. War shortages also caused problems, and the page count was reduced, first to 112 pages in 1943, and then to 96 pages the following year.

The price was increased to 20 cents in 1947, and again to 25 cents in 1949, but it was not only "Weird Tales" that was suffering—the entire pulp industry was in decline. Delaney switched the format to <a href="digest%20size">digest</a> with the September 1953 issue, but there was to be no reprieve. In 1954, "Weird Tales" and "Short Stories" ceased publication; in both cases the last issue was dated September 1954.

In the mid-1950s, <a href="Leo%20Margulies">Leo Margulies</a>, a well-known figure in the magazine publishing world, launched a new company, Renown Publications, with plans to publish several titles. He acquired the rights to both "Weird Tales" and "Short Stories", and hoped to bring both magazines back. He abandoned a plan to restart "Weird Tales" in 1962, using reprints from the original magazine, after being advised by <a href="Sam%20Moskowitz">Sam Moskowitz</a> that there was little market for weird and horror fiction at the time. Instead Margulies mined the "Weird Tales" backfile for four anthologies which appeared in the early 1960s: "The Unexpected", "The Ghoul-Keepers", "Weird Tales", and "Worlds of Weird". The latter two were ghost-edited by Moskowitz, who proposed to Margulies that when the time was right to start the magazine up again, it should include reprints from obscure sources that Moskowitz had found, rather than just stories reprinted from the first incarnation of "Weird Tales". These stories would be as good as new for most readers, and the money saved could be used for an occasional new story.

The new version of "Weird Tales" finally appeared from Renown Publications, in April 1973, edited by Moskowitz. It had weak distribution and sales were too low for sustainability; according to Moskowitz the average sales were 18,000 copies per issue, well short of the 23,000 that would have been needed for the magazine to survive. The fourth issue, dated Summer 1974, was the last, as Margulies closed down all his magazines except for "<a href="Mike%20Shayne%20Mystery%20Magazine">Mike Shayne Mystery Magazine</a>", which was the only one that was making a profit. <a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28writer%29">Mike Ashley</a>, a science fiction magazine historian, records that Moskowitz was unwilling to continue in any case, as he was annoyed by Margulies's detailed involvement in the day-to-day editorial tasks such as editing manuscripts and writing introductions.

Margulies died the following year, and his widow, Cylvia Margulies, decided to sell the rights to the title. <a href="Forrest%20J%20Ackerman">Forrest Ackerman</a>, a science fiction fan and editor, was one of the interested parties, but she chose instead to sell to Victor Dricks and Robert Weinberg. Weinberg in turn licensed the title to <a href="Lin%20Carter">Lin Carter</a>, who interested a publisher, <a href="Zebra%20Books">Zebra Books</a>, in the project. The result was a series of <a href="Weird%20Tales%20%28anthology%20series%29">four paperback anthologies</a>, edited by Lin Carter, appearing between 1981 and 1983; these were originally planned to be quarterly, but in fact the first two both appeared in December 1980 and were both dated Spring 1981. The next was dated Fall 1981; Carter's rights to the title were terminated by Weinberg in 1982 for non-payment, but the fourth issue was already in the works and finally appeared with a date of Summer 1983.

In 1982 <a href="Sheldon%20Jaffery">Sheldon Jaffery</a> and <a href="Roy%20Torgeson">Roy Torgeson</a> met with Weinberg to propose taking over as licensees, but Weinberg decided not to pursue the offer. The following year, Brian Forbes approached Weinberg with another offer. Forbes' company, the Bellerophon Network, was an imprint of a Los Angeles company named The Wizard. Ashley reports that Weinberg was only able to contact Forbes by phone, and even that was not always reliable, so negotiations were slow. Forbes' editorial director was Gordon Garb and the fiction editor was Gil Lamont; Forrest Ackerman also assisted, mainly by obtaining material to include. There was a good deal of confusion between the various participants in the project: according to "<a href="Locus%20%28magazine%29">Locus</a>", a science fiction trade journal, "Ackerman says he has had no contact with publisher Forbes, does not know what will happen to the material he put together, and is as much in the dark as everybody else. Lamont says that he is still renegotiating his contract and is not sure where he stands". The original plan was for the first issue to appear in August 1984, dated July/August, but before it appeared the decision was taken to change the contents, and a new, completely reset issue finally appeared at the end of the year, dated Fall 1984. Even with this delay a final agreement had not yet been reached with Weinberg over licensing. Only 12,500 copies were printed; these were sent to two distributors who both went into bankruptcy. As a result, few copies were sold, and Forbes was not paid by the distributors. Despite the financial setback, Forbes attempted to continue, and a second issue eventually appeared. Its cover date was Winter 1985 but it was not published until June 1986. Few copies were printed; reports vary between 1,500 and 2,300 in total. Mark Monsolo was the fiction editor, but Garb continued as editorial director; Lamont was no longer involved with the magazine.

"Weird Tales" was more lastingly revived at the end of the 1980s by <a href="George%20H.%20Scithers">George H. Scithers</a>, <a href="John%20Gregory%20Betancourt">John Gregory Betancourt</a> and <a href="Darrell%20Schweitzer">Darrell Schweitzer</a>, who formed Terminus Publishing, based in Philadelphia, and licensed the rights from Weinberg. Rather than focus on newsstand distribution, which was expensive and had become less effective in the 1980s, they planned to build a base of direct subscribers and distribute the magazine for sale through specialist stores. The first issue had a cover date of Spring 1988, but it was produced early enough to be available at the 1987 <a href="World%20Fantasy%20Convention">World Fantasy Convention</a> in <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a>. The size was the same as the original pulp version, though it was printed on better paper. There were also limited edition hardcover versions of each issue, signed by the contributors. A special <a href="World%20Fantasy%20Award">World Fantasy Award</a> "Weird Tales" received in 1992 made it apparent that the magazine was successful in terms of quality, but sales were insufficient to cover costs. To save money the format was changed to a larger flat size, starting with the Winter 1992/1993 issue, but the magazine remained in financial trouble, with issues becoming irregular over the next couple of years. The Summer 1993 issue was the last to have a hardcover edition; it was also the last, for a while, to bear the name "Weird Tales", as Weinberg did not renew the license. The magazine was retitled "Worlds of Fantasy & Horror", and the volume numbering was restarted at volume 1 number 1, but in every other way the magazine was unchanged, and the four issues under this title, issued between 1994 and 1996, are regarded by bibliographers as part of the overall "Weird Tales" run.

In April 1995, <a href="HBO">HBO</a> announced they had plans to turn "Weird Tales" into a three-episode anthology show similar to their "<a href="Tales%20from%20the%20Crypt%20%28TV%20series%29">Tales from the Crypt</a>" series. The deal for the rights was facilitated by screenwriters Mark Patrick Carducci and Peter Atkins. Directors <a href="Tim%20Burton">Tim Burton</a>, <a href="Francis%20Ford%20Coppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a>, and <a href="Oliver%20Stone">Oliver Stone</a> were executive producers, with each one expected to direct an episode. Stone was to be director of the pilot, but the series never came to fruition.
No issues appeared in 1997, but in 1998 Scithers and Schweitzer negotiated a deal with Warren Lupine of <a href="DNA%20Publications">DNA Publications</a> which allowed them to start publishing "Weird Tales" under license once again. The first issue was dated Summer 1998, and, other than the omission of the Winter 1998 issue, a regular quarterly schedule was maintained for the next four and a half years. Sales were weak, never rising above 6,000 copies, and DNA began to experience financial difficulties. Wildside Press, owned by John Betancourt, joined DNA and Terminus Publishing as co-publisher, starting with the July/August 2003 issue, and "Weird Tales" returned to a mostly regular schedule for a few months. A long hiatus ended with the December 2004 issue, which appeared in early 2005; this was the last issue under the arrangement with DNA. Wildside Press then bought "Weird Tales", and Betancourt again joined Scithers and Schweitzer as co-editor.

The first Wildside Press edition appeared in September 2005, and starting with the following issue, dated February 2006, the magazine was able to stay on a more or less bimonthly schedule for some time. In early 2007, Wildside announced a revamp of "Weird Tales", naming <a href="Stephen%20H.%20Segal">Stephen H. Segal</a> the editorial and creative director and later recruiting <a href="Ann%20VanderMeer">Ann VanderMeer</a> as the new fiction editor. In January 2010, the magazine announced Segal was leaving the top editorial post to become an editor at <a href="Quirk%20Books">Quirk Books</a>. VanderMeer was elevated to editor-in-chief, <a href="Mary%20Robinette%20Kowal">Mary Robinette Kowal</a> joined the staff as art director and Segal became senior contributing editor.

On August 23, 2011, John Betancourt announced that Wildside Press would be selling "Weird Tales" to Marvin Kaye and John Harlacher of Nth Dimension Media. Marvin Kaye took over chief editorial duties. Issue 359, the first under the new publishers, was published in late February 2012. Some months before the release of issue 359, a special World Fantasy Convention preview issue was given away for free to interested attendees. As of April 2018, the most recent issue to appear was dated Spring 2014. Despite this, Harlacher continues to sell 4-issue subscriptions to "Weird Tales," with no updates provided on the magazine's website regarding development of future issues of the magazine.

Henneberger gave "Weird Tales" the subtitle "The Unique Magazine" from the first issue. Henneberger had been hoping for submissions of "off-trail", or unusual, material. He later recalled talking to three well-known Chicago writers, <a href="Hamlin%20Garland">Hamlin Garland</a>, <a href="Emerson%20Hough">Emerson Hough</a>, and <a href="Ben%20Hecht">Ben Hecht</a>, each of whom had said they avoided writing stories of "fantasy, the bizarre, and the outré" because of the likelihood of rejection by existing markets. He added "I must confess that the main motive in establishing "Weird Tales" was to give the writer free rein to express his innermost feelings in a manner befitting great literature".

Edwin Baird, the first editor of "Weird Tales", was not an ideal choice for the job as he disliked horror stories; his expertise was in crime fiction, and most of the material he acquired was bland and unoriginal. The writers Henneberger had been hoping to publish, such as Garland and Hough, failed to submit anything to Baird, and the magazine published mostly traditional ghost fiction, with many of the stories narrated by characters in lunatic asylums, or told in diary format. The cover story for the first issue was "Ooze", by <a href="Anthony%20M.%20Rud">Anthony M. Rud</a>; there was also the first installment of a serial, "The Thing of A Thousand Shapes", by Otis Adelbert Kline, and 22 other stories. Ashley suggests that the better pulp writers from whom Baird did manage to acquire material, such as <a href="Gertrude%20Barrows%20Bennett">Francis Stevens</a> and Austin Hall, were sending Baird stories which had already been rejected elsewhere.

In the middle of the year Baird received five stories submitted by H. P. Lovecraft; Baird bought all five of them. Lovecraft, who had been persuaded by friends to submit the stories, included a cover letter that was so remarkably negative about the quality of the manuscripts that Baird published it in the September 1923 issue, with a note appended saying that he had bought the stories "despite the foregoing, or because of it". However, Baird insisted that the stories be resubmitted as typed double-spaced manuscripts; Lovecraft disliked typing, and initially decided to resubmit only one story, "<a href="Dagon%20%28short%20story%29">Dagon</a>". It appeared in the October 1923 issue, which was the most noteworthy of Baird's tenure, since it included stories by three writers who would become frequent contributors to "Weird Tales": as well as Lovecraft, it marked the first appearance in the magazine of <a href="Frank%20Owen%20%28author%29">Frank Owen</a> and <a href="Seabury%20Quinn">Seabury Quinn</a>.

Robert Weinberg, in his history of "Weird Tales", agrees with Ashley that the quality of Baird's issues was poor, but comments that some good stories were published: "it was just that the percentage of such stories was dismally small". Weinberg singles out "A Square of Canvas" by Rud, and "Beyond the Door" by Paul Suter as "exceptional"; both appeared in the April 1923 issue. Weinberg also regards "The Floor Above" by M. L. Humphries and "Penelope" by <a href="Vincent%20Starrett">Vincent Starrett</a>, both from the May 1923 issue, and "Lucifer" by John Swain, from the November 1923 issue, as memorable, and comments that "<a href="The%20Rats%20in%20the%20Walls">The Rats in the Walls</a>", in the March 1924 issue, was one of Lovecraft's finest stories. It is unclear whether Baird or Henneberger was responsible for buying Lovecraft's stories; in one of Lovecraft's letters he makes it clear that Baird was keen to acquire his stories, but Henneberger has said that he overrode Baird and that Baird did not like Lovecraft's writing. It was Henneberger who came up with another idea involving Lovecraft: Henneberger contacted <a href="Harry%20Houdini">Harry Houdini</a> and made arrangements to have Lovecraft ghost-write a story for him using a plot supplied by Houdini. The story, "<a href="Imprisoned%20with%20the%20Pharaohs">Imprisoned with the Pharaohs</a>", appeared under Houdini's name in the May/June/July 1924 issue, though it was nearly lost—Lovecraft left the typed manuscript on the train he took to New York to get married, and as a result spent much of his wedding day retyping the manuscript from the longhand copy he still had.

The May/June/July 1924 issue included another story by Lovecraft under another name: "<a href="The%20Loved%20Dead">The Loved Dead</a>", a story by <a href="C.%20M.%20Eddy%20Jr.">C. M. Eddy Jr.</a> which included a mention of <a href="necrophilia">necrophilia</a>. According to Eddy, this led to the magazine being removed from the newsstands in several cities, and beneficial publicity for the magazine, helping sales, but in his history of "Weird Tales" Robert Weinberg reports that he found no evidence of the magazine being banned, and the financial state of the magazine implies there was no benefit to sales either. However, S. T. Joshi has said the magazine was indeed removed from newsstands in Indiana.

The cover art during Baird's tenure was dull; Ashley calls it "unattractive", and Weinberg describes the color scheme of the first issue's cover as "less than inspired", though he considers the next month's cover to be an improvement. He adds that from the May 1923 issue "the covers plunged into a pit of mediocrity". In Weinberg's opinion the poor cover art, frequently by R. M. Mally, was probably partly to blame for the magazine's lack of success under Baird. Weinberg also regards the interior art during the magazine's first year as very weak; most of the interior drawings were small, and with little of the atmosphere one would expect from a horror magazine. All the illustrations were by Heitman, whom Weinberg describes as "... notable for his complete lack of imagination. Heitman's specialty was taking the "one" scene in a frightening story that featured nothing at all frightening or weird and illustrating that".

The new editor, Farnsworth Wright, was much more willing than Baird had been to publish stories that did not fit into any of the existing pulp categories. Ashley describes Wright as "erratic" in his selections, but under his guidance the magazine steadily improved in quality. His first issue, November 1924, was little better than those edited by Baird, although it included two stories by new writers, <a href="Frank%20Belknap%20Long">Frank Belknap Long</a> and <a href="Greye%20La%20Spina">Greye La Spina</a>, who became popular contributors. Over the following year, Wright established a group of writers as regulars, including Long and La Spina, and published many stories by writers who would be closely associated with the magazine for the next decade and more. In April 1925, <a href="Nictzin%20Dyalhis">Nictzin Dyalhis</a>'s first story, "When the Green Star Waned", appeared; although Weinberg regards it as very dated, it was highly regarded at the time, with Wright listing it in 1933 as the most popular story to appear in "Weird Tales". That issue also contained the first instalment of La Spina's novel "<a href="Invaders%20from%20the%20Dark">Invaders from the Dark</a>", which Baird had rejected as "too commonplace". It proved to be extremely popular with readers, and Weinberg comments that Baird's rejection was "just one of the many mistakes made by the earlier editor".

<a href="Arthur%20J.%20Burks">Arthur J. Burks</a>, who would go on to be a very successful pulp writer, appeared under both his real name and under a pseudonym, used for his first sale, in January 1925. <a href="Robert%20Spencer%20Carr">Robert Spencer Carr</a>'s first story appeared in March 1925; <a href="H.%20Warner%20Munn">H. Warner Munn</a>'s "The Werewolf of Ponkert" appeared in July 1925, and in the same issue Wright printed "Spear and Fang", the first professional sale of <a href="Robert%20E.%20Howard">Robert E. Howard</a>, who would become famous as the creator of <a href="Conan%20the%20Barbarian">Conan the Barbarian</a>. In late 1925 Wright added a ""Weird Tales" reprint" department, which showcased old weird stories, typically horror classics. Often these were translations, and in some cases the appearance in "Weird Tales" was the story's first appearance in English.

Wright initially rejected Lovecraft's "<a href="The%20Call%20of%20Cthulhu">The Call of Cthulhu</a>", but eventually bought it, and printed it in the February 1928 issue. This was the first tale of the <a href="Cthulhu%20Mythos">Cthulhu Mythos</a>, a fictional universe in which Lovecraft set several stories. Over time other writers began to contribute their own stories with the same shared background, including Frank Belknap Long, August Derleth, <a href="E.%20Hoffmann%20Price">E. Hoffmann Price</a>, and <a href="Donald%20Wandrei">Donald Wandrei</a>. Robert E. Howard and Clark Ashton Smith were friends of Lovecraft's, but did not contribute Cthulhu stories; instead Howard wrote <a href="sword%20and%20sorcery">sword and sorcery</a> fiction, and Smith produced a series of <a href="high%20fantasy">high fantasy</a> stories, many of which were part of his <a href="Hyperborean%20cycle">Hyperborean cycle</a>. <a href="Robert%20Bloch">Robert Bloch</a>, later to become well known as the writer of the movie "<a href="Psycho%20%281960%20film%29">Psycho</a>", began publishing stories in "Weird Tales" in 1935; he was a fan of Lovecraft's work, and asked Lovecraft's permission to include Lovecraft as a character in one of his stories, and to kill the character off. Lovecraft gave him permission, and reciprocated by killing off a thinly disguised version of Bloch in one of his own stories not long afterwards. Edmond Hamilton, a leading early writer of <a href="space%20opera">space opera</a>, became a regular, and Wright also published science fiction stories by <a href="Joseph%20Schlossel">J. Schlossel</a> and Otis Adelbert Kline. <a href="Tennessee%20Williams">Tennessee Williams</a>' first sale was to "Weird Tales", with a short story titled "<a href="The%20Vengeance%20of%20Nitocris">The Vengeance of Nitocris</a>". This was published in the August 1928 issue under the author's real name, Thomas Lanier Williams."Weird Tales"' subtitle was "The Unique Magazine", and Wright's story selections were as varied as the subtitle promised; he was willing to print strange or bizarre stories with no hint of the fantastic if they were unusual enough to fit in the magazine. Although Wright's editorial standards were broad, and although he personally disliked the restrictions that convention placed on what he could publish, he did exercise caution when presented with material that might offend his readership. E. Hoffmann Price records that his story "Stranger from Kurdistan" was held after purchase for six months before Wright printed it in the July 1925 issue; the story includes a scene in which Christ and Satan meet, and Wright was worried about the possible reader reaction. The story nevertheless proved to be very popular, and Wright reprinted it in the December 1929 issue. He also published "The Infidel's Daughter" by Price, a satire of the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>, which drew an angry letter and a cancelled subscription from a Klan member. Price later recalled Wright's response: "a story that arouses controversy is good for circulation ... and anyway it would be worth a reasonable loss to rap bigots of that caliber". Wright also printed <a href="George%20Fielding%20Eliot">George Fielding Eliot</a>'s "The Copper Bowl", a story about a young woman being tortured; she dies when her torturer forces a rat to eat through her body. Weinberg suggests that the story was so gruesome that it would have been difficult to place in a magazine even fifty years later.

On several occasions Wright rejected a story of Lovecraft's only to reconsider later; de Camp suggests that Wright's rejection at the end of 1925 of Lovecraft's "<a href="In%20the%20Vault">In the Vault</a>", a story about a mutilated corpse taking revenge on the undertaker responsible, was because it was "too gruesome", but Wright changed his mind a few years later, and the story eventually appeared in April 1932. Wright also rejected Lovecraft's "<a href="Through%20the%20Gates%20of%20the%20Silver%20Key">Through the Gates of the Silver Key</a>" in mid-1933. Price had revised the story before passing it to Wright, and after Wright and Price discussed the story, Wright bought it, in November of that year. Wright turned down Lovecraft's novel "<a href="At%20the%20Mountains%20of%20Madness">At the Mountains of Madness</a>" in 1935, though in this case it was probably because of the story's length—running a serial required paying an author for material that would not appear until two or three issues later, and "Weird Tales" often had little cash to spare. In this case he did not change his mind.

Quinn was "Weird Tales"' most prolific author, with a long-running sequence of stories about a detective, <a href="Jules%20de%20Grandin">Jules de Grandin</a>, who investigated supernatural events, and for a while he was the most popular writer in the magazine. Other regular contributors included <a href="Paul%20Ernst%20%28American%20writer%29">Paul Ernst</a>, <a href="David%20H.%20Keller">David H. Keller</a>, Greye La Spina, <a href="Hugh%20B.%20Cave">Hugh B. Cave</a>, and Frank Owen, who wrote fantasies set in an imaginary version of the Far East. <a href="C.%20L.%20Moore">C.L. Moore</a>'s story "<a href="Shambleau">Shambleau</a>", her first sale, appeared in "Weird Tales" in November 1933; Price visited the "Weird Tales" offices shortly after Wright read the manuscript for it, and recalls that Wright was so enthusiastic about the story that he closed the office, declaring it "C.L. Moore day". The story was very well received by readers, and Moore's work, including her stories about <a href="Jirel%20of%20Joiry">Jirel of Joiry</a> and <a href="Northwest%20Smith">Northwest Smith</a>, appeared almost exclusively in "Weird Tales" over the next three years.As well as fiction, Wright printed a substantial amount of poetry, with at least one poem included in most issues. Originally this often included reprints of poems such as <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>'s "<a href="Eldorado%20%28poem%29">El Dorado</a>", but soon most of the poetry was original, with contributions coming from Lovecraft, Howard, and Clark Ashton Smith, among many others. Lovecraft's contributions included ten of his "<a href="Fungi%20from%20Yuggoth">Fungi from Yuggoth</a>" poems, a series of sonnets on weird themes that he wrote in 1930.
The artwork was an important element of the magazine's personality, with <a href="Margaret%20Brundage">Margaret Brundage</a>, who painted many covers featuring nudes for "Weird Tales", perhaps the best known artist. Many of Brundage's covers were for stories by Seabury Quinn, and Brundage later commented that once Quinn realized that Wright always commissioned covers from Brundage that included a nude, "he made sure that each de Grandin story had at least one sequence where the heroine shed all her clothes". For over three years in the early 1930s, from June 1933 to August/September 1936, Brundage was the only cover artist "Weird Tales" used. Another prominent cover artist was <a href="J.%20Allen%20St.%20John">J. Allen St. John</a>, whose covers were more action-oriented, and who designed the title logo used from 1933 until 2007. <a href="Hannes%20Bok">Hannes Bok</a>'s first professional sale was to "Weird Tales", for the cover of the December 1939 issue; he became a frequent contributor over the next few years.

<a href="Virgil%20Finlay">Virgil Finlay</a>, one of the most important figures in the history of science fiction and fantasy art, made his first sale to Wright in 1935; Wright only bought one interior illustration from Finlay at that time because he was concerned that Finlay's delicate technique would not reproduce well on pulp paper. After a test print on pulp stock demonstrated that the reproduction was more than adequate, Wright began to buy regularly from Finlay, who became a regular cover artist for "Weird Tales" starting with the December 1935 issue. Demand from readers for Finlay's artwork was so high that in 1938 Wright commissioned a series of illustrations from Finlay for lines taken from famous poems, such as "O sweet and far, from cliff and scar/The horns of Elfland faintly blowing", from Tennyson's "<a href="The%20Princess%20%28Tennyson%20poem%29">The Princess</a>". Not every artist was as successful as Brundage and Finlay: Price suggested that <a href="Curtis%20Senf">Curtis Senf</a>, who painted 45 covers early in Wright's tenure, "was one of Sprenger's bargains", meaning that he produced poor art, but worked fast for low rates.

During the 1930s, Brundage's rate for a cover painting was $90. Finlay received $100 for his first cover, which appeared in 1937, over a year after his first interior illustrations were used; Weinberg suggests that the higher fee was partly to cover postage, since Brundage lived in Chicago and delivered her artwork in person, but it was also because Brundage's popularity was beginning to decline. When Delaney acquired the magazine in late 1938, the fee for a cover painting was cut to $50, and in Weinberg's opinion the quality of the artwork declined immediately. Nudes no longer appeared, though it is not known if this was a deliberate policy on Delaney's part. In 1939 a campaign by <a href="Fiorello%20H.%20La%20Guardia">Fiorello LaGuardia</a>, the mayor of New York, to eliminate sex from the pulps led to milder covers, and this may also have had an effect.In 1936, Howard committed suicide, and the following year Lovecraft died. There was so much unpublished work by Lovecraft that Wright was able to use that he printed more material under Lovecraft's byline after his death than before. In Howard's case, there was no such trove of stories available, but other writers such as Henry Kuttner provided similar material. By the end of Wright's tenure as editor, many of the writers who had become strongly associated with the magazine were gone; Kuttner, and others such as Price and Moore, were still writing, but "Weird Tales"' rates were too low to attract submissions from them. Clark Ashton Smith had stopped writing, and two other writers who were well-liked, G.G. Pendarves and Henry Whitehead, had died.
Except for a couple of short-lived magazines such as "<a href="Strange%20Tales%20%28pulp%20magazine%29">Strange Tales</a>" and "<a href="Tales%20of%20Magic%20and%20Mystery%20%28magazine%29">Tales of Magic and Mystery</a>", and a weak challenge from "<a href="Ghost%20Stories%20%28magazine%29">Ghost Stories</a>", all between the late 1920s and the early 1930s, "Weird Tales" had little competition for most of Wright's sixteen years as editor. In the early 1930s, a series of pulp magazines began to appear that became known as "<a href="weird%20menace">weird menace</a>" magazines. These lasted until the end of the decade, but despite the name there was little overlap in subject matter between them and "Weird Tales": the stories in the weird menace magazines appeared to be based on occult or supernatural events, but at the end of the tale the mystery was always revealed to have a logical explanation. In 1935 Wright began running weird detective stories to try to attract some of the readers of these magazines to "Weird Tales", and asked readers to write in with comments. Reader reaction was uniformly negative, and after a year he announced that there would be no more of them.

In 1939 two more serious threats appeared, both launched to compete directly for "Weird Tales"' readers. "<a href="Strange%20Stories">Strange Stories</a>" appeared in February 1939 and lasted for just over two years; Weinberg describes it as "top-quality", though Ashley is less complimentary, describing it as largely unoriginal and imitative. The following month the first issue of "<a href="Unknown%20%28magazine%29">Unknown</a>" appeared from Street & Smith. <a href="Fritz%20Leiber">Fritz Leiber</a> submitted several of his "<a href="Fafhrd%20and%20the%20Gray%20Mouser">Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser</a>" stories to Wright, but Wright rejected all of them (as did McIlwraith when she took over the editorship). Leiber subsequently sold them all to John W. Campbell for "Unknown;" Campbell commented each time to Leiber that "these would be better in "Weird Tales"". The stories grew into a very popular sword and sorcery series, but none of them ever appeared in "Weird Tales". Leiber did eventually sell several stories to "Weird Tales", beginning with "The Automatic Pistol", which appeared in May 1940.

"Weird Tales" included a letters column, titled "The Eyrie", for most of its existence, and during Wright's time as editor it was usually filled with long and detailed letters. When Brundage's nude covers appeared, a lengthy debate over whether they were suitable for the magazine was fought out in the Eyrie, with the two sides divided about equally. For years it was the most discussed topic in the magazine's letter column. Many of the authors Wright published wrote letters too, including Lovecraft, Howard, Kuttner, Bloch, Smith, Quinn, Wellman, Price, and Wandrei. In most cases these letters praised the magazine, but occasionally a critical comment was raised, as when Bloch repeatedly expressed his dislike for Howard's stories of Conan the Barbarian, referring to him as "Conan the Cimmerian Chipmunk". Another debate that was aired in the letter column was the question of how much science fiction the magazine should include. Until "Amazing Stories" was launched in April 1926, science fiction was popular with "Weird Tales"' readers, but after that point letters began to appear asking Wright to exclude science fiction, and only publish weird fantasy and horror. The pro-science fiction readers were in the majority, and as Wright agreed with them, he continued to include science fiction in "Weird Tales". Hugh B. Cave, who sold half-a-dozen stories to Wright in the early 1930s, commented on "The Eyrie" in a letter to a fellow writer: "No other magazine makes such a point of discussing past stories, and letting the authors know how their stuff is received".

McIlwraith was an experienced magazine editor, but she knew little about weird fiction, and unlike Wright she also had to face real competition from other magazines for "Weird Tales"' core readership. Although "Unknown" folded in 1943, in its four years of existence it transformed the field of fantasy and horror, and "Weird Tales" was no longer regarded as the leader in its field. "Unknown" published many successful humorous fantasy stories, and McIlwraith responded by including some humorous material, but "Weird Tales" rates were less than "Unknown", with predictable effects on quality. In 1940 the policy of reprinting horror and weird classics ceased, and "Weird Tales" began using the slogan "All Stories New – No Reprints". Weinberg suggests that this was a mistake, as "Weird Tales" readership appreciated getting access to classic stories "often mentioned but rarely found". Without the reprints "Weird Tales" was left to survive on the rejects from "Unknown", with the same authors selling to both markets. In Weinberg's words, "only the quality of the stories [separated] their work between the two pulps".

Delaney's personal taste also reduced McIlwraith's latitude. In an interview with Robert A. Lowndes in early 1940, Delaney spoke about his plans for "Weird Tales". After saying that the magazine would still publish "all types of weird and fantasy fiction", Lowndes reported that Delaney did not want "stories which center about sheer repulsiveness, stories which leave an impression not to be described by any other word than 'nasty. Lowndes later added that Delaney had told him he found some of Clark Ashton Smith's stories on the "disgusting side".

McIlwraith continued to publish many of "Weird Tales"' most popular authors, including Quinn, Derleth, Hamilton, Bloch, and <a href="Manly%20Wade%20Wellman">Manly Wade Wellman</a>. She also added new contributors; as well as publishing many of <a href="Ray%20Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a>'s early stories, "Weird Tales" regularly featured <a href="Fredric%20Brown">Fredric Brown</a>, <a href="Mary%20Elizabeth%20Counselman">Mary Elizabeth Counselman</a>, <a href="Fritz%20Leiber">Fritz Leiber</a>, and <a href="Theodore%20Sturgeon">Theodore Sturgeon</a>. As Wright had done, McIlwraith continued to buy Lovecraft stories submitted by August Derleth, though she abridged some of the longer pieces, such as "<a href="The%20Shadow%20over%20Innsmouth">The Shadow over Innsmouth</a>". Sword and sorcery stories, a genre which Howard had made much more popular with his stories of Conan, <a href="Solomon%20Kane">Solomon Kane</a> and <a href="Bran%20Mak%20Morn">Bran Mak Morn</a> in "Weird Tales" in the early 1930s, had continued to appear under Farnsworth Wright; they all but disappeared during McIlwraith's tenure. McIlwraith also focused more on short fiction, and serials and long stories were rare.

In May 1951 "Weird Tales" once again began to include reprints, in an attempt to reduce costs, but by that time the earlier issues of "Weird Tales" had been extensively mined for reprints by August Derleth's publishing venture, <a href="Arkham%20House">Arkham House</a>, and as a result McIlwraith often reprinted lesser-known stories. They were not advertised as reprints, which led in a couple of cases to letters from readers asking for more stories from H. P. Lovecraft, whom they believed to be a new author.In Weinberg's opinion, the magazine lost variety under McIlwraith's editorship, and "much of the uniqueness of the magazine was gone". In Ashley's view, the magazine became more consistent in quality, rather than worse; Ashley comments that though the issues edited by McIlwraith "seldom attain[ed] Wright's highpoints, they also omitted the lows". L. Sprague de Camp, towards the end of McIlwraith's time as editor, agreed that the 1930s were the magazine's heyday, citing Wright's death and the departure for other, better-paying, markets of several of its contributors as factors in the magazine's decline.

The quality of "Weird Tales" artwork suffered when Delaney cut the rates. Bok, whose first cover had appeared in December 1939, moved to New York and joined the office art staff for a while; he eventually left because of the low pay. <a href="Boris%20Dolgov">Boris Dolgov</a> began contributing in the 1940s; he was a friend of Bok's and the two occasionally collaborated, signing the result "Dolbokgov". Weinberg regards Dolgov's illustration for Robert Bloch's "Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper" as one of his best works. "Weird Tales" paper was of very poor quality, which meant that the reproductions were poor, and along with the low pay rate for art this meant that many artists treated "Weird Tales" as a last resort for their work. <a href="Damon%20Knight">Damon Knight</a>, who sold some interior artwork to "Weird Tales" in the early 1940s, recalled later that he was paid $5 for a single-page drawing, and $10 for a double-page spread; he worked slowly and the low pay meant "Weird Tales" was not a viable market for him.

The art editor, Lamont Buchanan, was able to establish five artists as regulars by the mid-1940s; they remained regular contributors until 1954, when the magazine's first incarnation ceased publication. The five were Dolgov, <a href="John%20Giunta">John Giunta</a>, Fred Humiston, <a href="Vincent%20Napoli">Vincent Napoli</a>, and <a href="Lee%20Brown%20Coye">Lee Brown Coye</a>. In Weinberg's review of "Weird Tales" interior art, he describes Humiston's work as ranging "from bad to terrible", but he is more positive about the others. Napoli had worked for "Weird Tales" from 1932 to the mid-1930s, when he began selling to the science fiction pulps, but his work for "Short Stories" brought him back to "Weird Tales" in the 1940s. Weinberg speaks highly of both Napoli and Coye, whom Weinberg describes as "the master of the weird and grotesque illustration". Coye did a series of full-page illustrations for "Weird Tales" called "Weirdisms", which ran intermittently from November 1948 to July 1951.

The letter column, "The Eyrie", was much reduced in size during McIlwraith's tenure, but as a gesture to the readers a ""Weird Tales" Club" was started. Joining the Club simply meant writing in to receive a free membership card; the only other benefit was that the magazine listed all the members' names and addresses, so that members could contact each other. Among the names listed in the January 1943 issue was that of <a href="Hugh%20Hefner">Hugh Hefner</a>, later to become famous as the founder of "<a href="Playboy">Playboy</a>".

Towards the end of McIlwraith's time as editor a couple of new writers appeared, including <a href="Richard%20Matheson">Richard Matheson</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Payne%20Brennan">Joseph Payne Brennan</a>. Brennan had already sold over a dozen stories to other pulps when he finally made a sale to McIlwraith, but he had always wanted to sell to "Weird Tales", and three years after the magazine folded he launched a small-press horror magazine named "<a href="Macabre%20%28magazine%29">Macabre</a>", which he published for some years, in imitation of "Weird Tales".

The four issues edited by Sam Moskowitz in the early 1970s were mostly notable for a detailed biography of <a href="William%20Hope%20Hodgson">William Hope Hodgson</a>, serialized over three issues, along with some rare stories of Hodgson's that Moskowitz had unearthed. Many of the other stories were reprints, either from "Weird Tales" or from other early pulps such as "<a href="The%20Black%20Cat%20%28magazine%29">The Black Cat</a>" or "<a href="Blue%20Book%20%28magazine%29">Blue Book</a>". In Ashley's opinion, the magazine "had the feel of a museum piece with nothing new or progressive", though Weinberg describes the magazine as having "an interesting jumble of contents". The subsequent paperback series edited by Lin Carter was criticized in similar terms: Weinberg regards it as having "too much reliance ... on the old names like Lovecraft, Howard and Smith by reprinting mediocre material ... New writers were not sufficiently encouraged", though Weinberg does add that <a href="Ramsey%20Campbell">Ramsey Campbell</a>, <a href="Tanith%20Lee">Tanith Lee</a> and <a href="Steve%20Rasnic%20Tem">Steve Rasnic Tem</a> were among the newer writers who contributed good material. Ashley's opinion of the two Bellerophon issues is low: he describes them as lacking "any clear editorial direction or acumen".

The April/May 2007 edition featured the magazine's first all-new design in almost seventy-five years. During the next few years, "Weird Tales" published works by a wide range of strange-fiction authors including <a href="Michael%20Moorcock">Michael Moorcock</a> and Tanith Lee, as well as newer writers such as <a href="Jay%20Lake">Jay Lake</a>, <a href="Cat%20Rambo">Cat Rambo</a>, and <a href="Rachel%20Swirsky">Rachel Swirsky</a>. The period also saw the addition of a broader range of content, ranging from narrative essays to comics to features on weird culture. The magazine won its first <a href="Hugo%20Award">Hugo Award</a> in August 2009, in the <a href="Hugo%20Award%20for%20Best%20Semiprozine">semiprozine</a> category, two Hugo Award nominations in subsequent years, and its first World Fantasy Award nomination, for editors Segal and Vandermeer, in more than seventeen years.

In August 2012, "Weird Tales" became involved in a media altercation after the editor announced the magazine was going to publish an excerpt from <a href="Victoria%20Foyt">Victoria Foyt</a>'s controversial novel "<a href="Save%20the%20Pearls">Save the Pearls</a>", which many critics accused of featuring racist <a href="stereotyping">stereotyping</a>. The decision was made despite the protests of VanderMeer, and prompted her to end her association with the magazine. The publisher subsequently overruled the editor, and announced that "Weird Tales" no longer had plans to run the excerpt.

"Weird Tales" was one of the most important magazines in the fantasy field; in Ashley's view, it is "second only to "Unknown" in significance and influence". Weinberg goes further, calling it "the most important and influential of all fantasy magazines". Weinberg argues that much of the material "Weird Tales" published would never have appeared if the magazine had not existed. It was through "Weird Tales" that Lovecraft, Howard, and Clark Ashton Smith became widely known, and it was the first and one of the most important markets for weird and science fantasy artwork. Many of the horror stories adapted for early radio shows such as "<a href="Stay%20Tuned%20for%20Terror%20%28radio%20show%29">Stay Tuned for Terror</a>" originally appeared in "Weird Tales". The magazine's "Golden Age" was under Wright, and de Camp argues that one of Wright's accomplishments was to create a ""Weird Tales" school of writing". Justin Everett and Jeffrey H. Shanks, the editors of a recent scholarly collection of literary criticism focused on the magazine, argue that ""Weird Tales" functioned as a nexus point in the development of speculative fiction from which emerged the modern genres of fantasy and horror".

The magazine was, unusually for a pulp, included by the editors of the annual Year in Fiction anthologies, and was generally regarded with more respect than most of the pulps. This remained true long after the magazine's first run ended, as it became the main source of fantasy short stories for anthologists for several decades. Weinberg argues that the fantasy pulps, of which, in his opinion, "Weird Tales" was the most influential, helped to form the modern fantasy genre, and that Wright, "if he was not a perfect editor ... was an extraordinary one, and one of the most influential figures in modern American fantasy fiction", adding that "Weird Tales" and its competitors "served as the bedrock upon which much of modern fantasy rests". Everett and Shanks agree, and regard "Weird Tales" as the venue where writers, editors and an engaged readership "elevated speculated fiction to new heights" with influence that "reverberates through modern popular culture". In Ashley's words, "somewhere in the imagination reservoir of all U.S. (and many non-U.S.) genre-fantasy and horror writers is part of the spirit of "Weird Tales"".

The editorial succession at "Weird Tales" was as follows:

The publisher for the first year was Rural Publishing Corporation; this changed to Popular Fiction Publishing with the November 1924 issue, and to Weird Tales, Inc. with the December 1938 issue. The four issues in the early 1970s came from Renown Publications, and the four paperbacks in the early 1980s were published by Zebra Books. The next two issues were from Bellerophon, and then from Spring 1988 to Winter 1996 the publisher was Terminus. From Summer 1998 to July/August 2003 the publisher was DNA Publications and Terminus, listed either as DNA Publications/Terminus or just as DNA Publications. The September/October 2003 issue listed the publisher as DNA Publications/Wildside Press/Terminus, and through 2004 this remained the case, with one issue dropping Terminus from the masthead. Thereafter Wildside Press was the publisher, sometimes with Terminus listed as well, until the September/October 2007 issue, after which only Wildside Press were listed. The issues published from 2012 through 2014 were from Nth Dimension Media.

"Weird Tales" was in pulp format for its entire first run except for the issues from May 1923 to April 1924, when it was a large pulp, and the last year, from September 1953 to September 1954, when it was a digest. The four 1970s issues were in pulp format. The two Bellerophon issues were <a href="bookbinding">quarto</a>. The Terminus issues reverted to pulp format until the Winter 1992/1993 issue, which was large pulp. A single pulp issue appeared in Fall 1998, and then the format returned to large pulp until the Fall 2000 issue, which was quarto. The format varied between large pulp and quarto until January 2006, which was large pulp, as were all issues after that date until Fall 2009, except for a quarto-sized November 2008. From Summer 2010 the format was quarto.

The first run of the magazine was priced at 25 cents for the first fifteen years of its life except for the oversized May/June/July 1924 issue, which was 50 cents. In September 1939 the price was reduced to 15 cents, where it stayed until the September 1947 issue, which was 20 cents. The price went up again to 25 cents in May 1949; the digest-sized issues from September 1953 to September 1954 were 35 cents. The first three paperbacks edited by Lin Carter were priced at $2.50; the fourth was $2.95. The two Bellerophon issues were $2.50 and $2.95. The Terminus "Weird Tales" began in Spring 1988 priced at $3.50; this went up to $4.00 with the Fall 1988 issue, and to $4.95 with the Summer 1990 issue. The next price increase was to $5.95, in Spring 2003, and then to $6.99 with the January 2008 issue. The first two issues from Nth Dimension Media were priced at $7.95 and $6.99; the last two were $9.99 each.

Some of the early Terminus editions of "Weird Tales" were also printed in hardcover format, in limited editions of 200 copies. These were signed by the contributors, and were available at $40 as part of a subscription offer. Issues produced in this format include Summer 1988, Spring/Fall 1989, Winter 1989/1990, Spring 1991, and Winter 1991/1992.

Starting in 1925, <a href="Christine%20Campbell%20Thomson">Christine Campbell Thomson</a> edited a series of horror story anthologies, published by <a href="Selwyn%20and%20Blount">Selwyn and Blount</a>, titled "Not at Night". These were considered an unofficial U.K. edition of the magazine, with the stories sometimes appearing in the anthology before the magazine's U.S. version appeared. The ones which drew a substantial fraction of their contents from "Weird Tales" were:

There was also a 1937 anthology titled "Not at Night Omnibus", which selected 35 stories from the "Not at Night" series, of which 20 had originally appeared in "Weird Tales". In the U.S. an anthology titled "Not at Night!", edited by Herbert Asbury, appeared from <a href="Macy-Macius">Macy-Macius</a> in 1928; this selected 25 stories from the series, with 24 of them drawn from "Weird Tales."

Numerous other anthologies of stories from "Weird Tales" have been published, including:

A Canadian edition of "Weird Tales" appeared from June 1935 to July 1936; all fourteen issues are thought to be identical to the U.S. issues of those dates, though "Printed in Canada" appeared on the cover, and in at least one case another text box was placed on the cover to conceal part of a nude figure. Another Canadian series began in 1942, as a result of import restrictions placed on U.S. magazines. Canadian editions from 1942 up to January 1948 were not identical to the U.S. editions, but they match closely enough that the originals are easily identified. From the May 1942 to January 1945 issues, they correspond to the U.S. editions two issues earlier, that is, from January 1942 to September 1944. There was no Canadian issue corresponding to the November 1944 U.S. issue, so from that point the Canadian issues were only one behind the U.S. ones: the issues from March 1945 to January 1948 correspond to the U.S. issues from January 1945 to November 1947. There was no Canadian issue of the January 1948 U.S. issue, and from the next issue, March 1948, till the end of the Canadian run in November 1951, the issues were identical to the U.S. versions.

There were numerous differences between the Canadian issues from May 1942 to January 1948 and the corresponding U.S. issues. All the covers were repainted by Canadian artists until the January 1945 issue; thereafter the artwork from the original issues was used. Initially the fiction content of the Canadian issues was unchanged from the U.S., but starting in September 1942 the Canadian "Weird Tales" dropped some of the original stories in each issue, replacing them with either stories from other issues of "Weird Tales", or, occasionally, material from "Short Stories".

In a couple of instances a story appeared in the Canadian edition of the magazine before its appearance in the U.S. version, or simultaneously with it, so it is evident that whoever assembled the issues had access to the "Weird Tales" pending story file. Because of the reorganization of material, it often happened that one of the Canadian issues would have more than a single story by the same author. In these cases a pseudonym was invented for one of the stories.

There were four separate editions of "Weird Tales" distributed in the United Kingdom. In early 1942, three issues abridged from the September 1940, November 1940, and January 1941 U.S. issues were published in the U.K. by Gerald Swan; they were undated, and had no volume numbers. The middle issue was 64 pages long; the other two were 48 pages. All were priced at 6<a href="%C2%A3sd">d</a>. A single issue was released in late 1946 by William Merrett; it also was undated and unnumbered. It was 36 pages long, and was priced at 1/6. The three stories included came from the October 1937 U.S. issue.

A longer run of 23 issues appeared between November 1949 and December 1953, from Thorpe and Porter. These were all undated; the first issue had no volume or issue number but subsequent issues were numbered sequentially. Most were priced at 1/-; issues 11 to 15 were 1/6. All were 96 pages long. The first issue corresponds to the July 1949 U.S. issue; the next 20 issues correspond to the U.S. issues from November 1949 to January 1953, and the final two issues correspond to May 1953 and March 1953, in that order. Another five bimonthly issues appeared from Thorpe and Porter dated November 1953 to July 1954, with the volume numbering restarted at volume 1 number 1. These correspond to the U.S. issues from September 1953 to May 1954.

"Weird Tales" is widely collected, and many issues command very high prices. In 2008, Mike Ashley estimated the first issue to be worth £3,000 in excellent condition, and added that the second issue is much rarer and commands higher prices. Issues with stories by Lovecraft or Howard are very highly sought-after, with the October 1923 issue, containing "Dagon", Lovecraft's first appearance in "Weird Tales", fetching comparable prices to the first two issues. The first few volumes are so rare that very few academic collections have more than a handful of these issues: <a href="Eastern%20New%20Mexico%20University">Eastern New Mexico University</a>, the holder of a remarkably complete early science fiction archive, has "only a few scattered issues" from the early years, and the librarian recorded in 1983 that "dealers laugh when Eastern enquires about these".

Prices of the magazine drop over the succeeding decades, with the McIlwraith issues worth far less than the ones edited by Wright. Ashley quotes the digest-sized issues from the end of McIlwraith's tenure as fetching £8 to £10 each as of 2008. The revived editions are not particularly scarce, with two exceptions. The two Bellerophon issues received such poor distribution that they fetch high prices: Ashley quotes a 2008 price of £40 to £50 for the first one, and twice that for the second one. The other valuable recent issues are the hardback versions of the Terminus "Weird Tales"; Ashley gives prices of between £40 and £90, with some of the special author issues fetching a premium.

South of Heaven

South of Heaven is the fourth studio album by American <a href="thrash%20metal">thrash metal</a> band <a href="Slayer">Slayer</a>. Released on July 5, 1988, the album was the band's second collaboration with record producer <a href="Rick%20Rubin">Rick Rubin</a>, whose production skills on Slayer's previous album "<a href="Reign%20in%20Blood">Reign in Blood</a>" had helped the band's sound evolve.

"South of Heaven" was Slayer's second album to enter the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> and its last to be released by <a href="Def%20Jam%20Recordings">Def Jam Recordings</a>, although the album became an <a href="American%20Recordings%20%28US%29">American Recordings</a> album after Rubin ended his partnership with <a href="Russell%20Simmons">Russell Simmons</a>. It was one of only two Def Jam titles to be distributed by <a href="Geffen%20Records">Geffen Records</a> through <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Records">Warner Bros. Records</a> because of original distributor <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a>' refusal to release work by the band. The release peaked at number 57 and in 1992 was awarded a <a href="RIAA%20Certification">gold certification</a> by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a>.

In order to offset the pace of the group's previous album, Slayer deliberately slowed down the album's <a href="tempo">tempo</a>. In contrast to their previous albums, the band utilized undistorted guitars and toned-down vocals. While some critics praised this musical change, others—more accustomed to the style of earlier releases—were disappointed. The songs "Mandatory Suicide" and the title track, however, have become permanent features of the band's live setlist.

The album was recorded in Los Angeles, California with "<a href="Reign%20in%20Blood">Reign in Blood</a>" producer Rick Rubin. "<a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>" reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin's production "shoves [Dave] <a href="Dave%20Lombardo">Lombardo</a>'s drumming right up front in the mix". Guitarist <a href="Jeff%20Hanneman">Jeff Hanneman</a> has since said that "South of Heaven" was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music. Aware that they "couldn't top "<a href="Reign%20in%20Blood">Reign in Blood</a>"", and that whatever they recorded would be "compared to that album", he believed they "had to slow down", something Slayer had never done on albums before, or since. Guitarist <a href="Kerry%20King">Kerry King</a> cited the need to "keep people guessing" as another reason for the musical shift. "In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on "Reign in Blood", Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole", according to Slayer's official biography. "They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums."

King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his "most lackluster". King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona">Phoenix, Arizona</a>. Describing himself as "probably the odd man out at that point", he stated he "didn't participate as much because of that". Hanneman said: "We go through dry spells sometimes, but the good thing about having two guitar players that can write music is that you are never gonna go without. I guess at that time, Kerry was hitting a dry spell." King has also been critical of the album in general, describing it as one of his least favorite Slayer albums. He feels vocalist <a href="Tom%20Araya">Tom Araya</a> moved too far away from his regular vocal style, and "added too much singing". Drummer Dave Lombardo has since observed: "There was fire on all the records, but it started dimming when "South of Heaven" came into the picture. And that's me personally. Again, I was probably wanting something else."

<a href="Judas%20Priest">Judas Priest</a>'s "<a href="Dissident%20Aggressor">Dissident Aggressor</a>" is the first <a href="cover%20version">cover version</a> to appear on a Slayer studio album. The song was chosen due to its war-themed lyrics. Hanneman described the track as "more just like one of those odd songs that a lot of people didn't know, but it was a favorite of Kerry and I, so we just picked that one". Meanwhile, "Cleanse the Soul" has been heavily criticized by King who said that he hates the track: "That's one of the black marks in our history, in my book. I just fucking think it's horrible. [Laughs] I hate the opening riff. It's what we call a 'happy riff.' It's just like 'la-lala-la-la-la.' I can't see myself playing it, but after that, where it gets heavier, I like that section. If we ever did a medley, I'd put part of that in there." The Slayer boxset "<a href="Soundtrack%20to%20the%20Apocalypse">Soundtrack to the Apocalypse</a>" featured, along with four songs of the album, an early version of the title track, recorded at Hanneman's home.

Artist <a href="Larry%20Carroll%20%28artist%29">Larry Carroll</a> and illustrator Howard Schwartzberg designed the cover artwork for "South of Heaven", having designed the artwork for Slayer's previous album "Reign in Blood". Photographer <a href="Glen%20E.%20Friedman">Glen E. Friedman</a> took the promotional shot which surfaced as the back cover of "South of Heaven" around the time of 1986's "<a href="Reign%20in%20Blood">Reign in Blood</a>". Lombardo felt it made Slayer seem as though they "had matured a little bit", while Friedman himself deemed it "a really cool back cover" and "one of the most classic shots of them [Slayer] ever".

"South of Heaven" was released on July 5, 1988, and was the final Slayer album distributed via <a href="Def%20Jam%20Records">Def Jam Records</a>. When label co-founders <a href="Russell%20Simmons">Russell Simmons</a> and Rubin parted ways, Slayer signed to Rubin's newly founded <a href="American%20Recordings%20%28US%29">Def American Recordings</a> label. The album peaked at number 57 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> album chart, and on November 20, 1992, became Slayer's second album to be certified gold in the United States. "South of Heaven" was awarded silver certification in the United Kingdom on January 1, 1993, Slayer's first record to do so in that country. Slayer's official biography states that "some critics praised the album as demonstrating Slayer's desire to grow musically and avoid repeating themselves." Alex Henderson of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> described the record as "disturbing and powerful," while <a href="Joe%20Matera">Joe Matera</a> of "<a href="Ultimate%20Guitar">Ultimate Guitar</a>" deemed the album a slight departure; he wrote that while the pace was slowed down, it "didn't sacrifice any of the heaviness inherent in Slayer's music".

Reviewing the 2003 Slayer box set "<a href="Soundtrack%20to%20the%20Apocalypse">Soundtrack to the Apocalypse</a>", Adrien Begrand of <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> described the album as "their most underrated, and on this set, its five selections show how highly the band thinks of the record". "<a href="KNAC.com">KNAC.com</a>"'s Peter Atkinson was also positive, saying the album has a "grandiosity and imposing presence" which makes the record "so magnificent". <a href="Grave%20%28band%29">Grave</a>'s Ola Lindgren and <a href="Bolt%20Thrower">Bolt Thrower</a>'s <a href="Karl%20Willetts">Karl Willetts</a> both rate "South of Heaven" as amongst the top five albums of all time, while <a href="Max%20Kolesne">Max Kolesne</a> of Brazilian death metal group <a href="Krisiun">Krisiun</a> remembers hearing the song "Silent Scream" for the first time: "It just blew me away. It was like fast double-bass, fast kicks during the whole song. That was very inspiring for me." When discussing Slayer in an October 2007 interview, <a href="Evile">Evile</a> frontman Matt Drake stated that while "Reign in Blood" "was just speed", "South of Heaven" proved that the group could write "slow material as well". "<a href="Metal%20Forces">Metal Forces</a>" reviewer gives "the band credit for at least making an effort to try something new and not being afraid to experiment at such a crucial stage of their career", creating "one of the more original sounding thrash / speed metal albums he heard in a long while". He remarks, however, that "if you're expecting to hear "Reign in Blood" Part Two, you'll be in for a major disappointment".

Kim Neely of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" dismissed the album as "genuinely offensive satanic drivel". However, the magazine would later rank the album 47th on their 2017 "100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time" list. Slayer's official biography states: "The new sounds disappointed some of the band's fans who were more accustomed to the style of earlier releases." Michael Roberts of Westworld Online said this was due to some of the numbers moving "at the sludgier speed of <a href="Black%20Sabbath">Black Sabbath</a>". Araya commented that the "album was a late bloomer—it wasn't really received well, but it kind of grew on everybody later". <a href="Decibel%20%28magazine%29">Decibel</a> inducted "South of Heaven" into the Decibel Magazine Hall of Fame in January 2013. Due to <a href="Jeff%20Hanneman">Jeff Hanneman</a>'s passing in May of the same year, "South of Heaven" would be the second and final classic <a href="Slayer">Slayer</a> album to receive an induction into Decibel's Hall of Fame.

The title track and the song "Mandatory Suicide" have received various cover interpretations, particularly on Slayer tribute albums. Toni Ferguson recorded string quartet adaptations of both tracks on the album "The String Quartet Tribute to Slayer: The Evil You Dread", with "South of Heaven" being described as having "menacing chord shifts" by <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>'s Johnny Loftus.

1995 Slayer tribute album "Slatanic Slaughter" featured three songs which originally appeared on "South of Heaven", with "South of Heaven", "Mandatory Suicide" and "Spill the Blood" interpreted by <a href="Cemetary%20%28band%29">Cemetary</a>, <a href="Crown%20of%20Thorns%20%28band%29">Crown of Thorns</a> and Grope, respectively. Its 1998 follow up "Slatanic Slaughter, Vol. 2" only featured two tracks originally from the album: "Silent Scream", arranged by <a href="Vader%20%28band%29">Vader</a>, and "Read Between the Lies", interpreted by <a href="Anathema%20%28band%29">Anathema</a>. 1999's "Straight to Hell: A Tribute to Slayer" collected four Slayer renditions which originated on the album, with versions of "South of Heaven" performed by Abaddon, (<a href="Venom%20%28band%29">Venom</a>) and <a href="Electric%20Hellfire%20Club">Electric Hellfire Club</a>, "Mandatory Suicide" cut by Chapter 7 and "Behind the Crooked Cross" adapted by Gigantor. The 2006 Argentine tribute album "Al Sur Del Abismo (Tributo Argentino A Slayer)" saw Nafak and Climatic Terra also respectively cover "South of Heaven" and "Mandatory Suicide".

Two songs taken from the album ("Mandatory Suicide" and "South of Heaven") have become near constant fixtures in the band's live setlist, notching up appearances on the following: the live DVDs "<a href="Live%20Intrusion">Live Intrusion</a>", "<a href="War%20at%20the%20Warfield">War at the Warfield</a>", "<a href="Still%20Reigning">Still Reigning</a>", "<a href="Soundtrack%20to%20the%20Apocalypse">Soundtrack to the Apocalypse</a>"'s deluxe edition's bonus live disc, and the live double album "<a href="Decade%20of%20Aggression">Decade of Aggression</a>". Lombardo guested with <a href="Finland">Finnish</a> cellist group <a href="Apocalyptica">Apocalyptica</a> on a live medley of the two tracks at 1998's Headbanger's Heaven festival in the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>. Adrien Begrand of "<a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>" described "South of Heaven" as "an unorthodox set opener in theory", noting "the song went over like a megaton bomb detonating the place: dozens of inverted crosses projected behind the high drum riser, the sinewy opening notes kicked in, followed by an overture of bass, cymbal crashes, and tom fills, leading up to the slowly building crescendo" in a concert review. Lombardo remembers listening to a live rendition of "South of Heaven" and thinking, Man! There's just so much groove in that song.' To my kids I was saying, 'Listen to that! Listen to how groovy that is!' And it's heavy." A live version of the track featured on the "JÄGERMUSIC Rarities 2004" promotional CD, given away to attendees at the Spring 2004 Jägermeister Music Tour.
A live rendition of "South of Heaven" was also included on a bonus DVD which came with the group's 2007 re-release of ninth studio album "<a href="Christ%20Illusion">Christ Illusion</a>", shot in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, British Columbia during 2006's <a href="The%20Unholy%20Alliance%20%28tour%29">Unholy Alliance</a> tour.

"Behind the Crooked Cross" is rarely played live as Hanneman hates the track, though King has always wanted to play it "because it's got a cool intro" despite it not being his favorite song. King said "that's fine" when speaking of the situation, noting "there are songs that he wants to play that I always shoot down". "Ghosts of War" isn't King's favorite song either, which he attests "everybody always wants to hear" performed live. He confessed; "I like the ending, you know, I like the big heavy part and I always say, 'Let's put the heavy ending at the end of "Chemical Warfare" and just do the last half.' But I could never make that fly."

Slayer has toyed with the idea of creating a live set mixed with selections from the album and 1990's "<a href="Seasons%20in%20the%20Abyss">Seasons in the Abyss</a>", though Hanneman said it's something which hasn't been "seriously considered". "<a href="Metal%20Maniacs">Metal Maniacs</a>" asked Slayer in a 2006 interview whether they would consider playing "South of Heaven" in the footsteps of the "Still Reigning" tour, to which Araya replied, "It's becoming a trendy thing now. I don't know. We have some really cool albums, but I don't think we'll ever do that again." King was equally unsure, commenting, "Probably not. And I just don't like enough songs off "South of Heaven"."

"South of Heaven" was released as a downloadable song for "<a href="Rock%20Band%203">Rock Band 3</a>" in April 10, 2012 along with "Raining Blood" and "Seasons In The Abyss".

"South of Heaven"'s drum and bass beats were covered for a <a href="MIDI">MIDI</a> track known as "Shawn's Got the Shotgun" on various maps for the popular PC computer game "<a href="Doom%20II">Doom II</a>".

Florin (British coin)

The British florin, or two shilling coin, was issued from 1849 until 1967, with a final issue for collectors dated 1970. Valued at one tenth of a <a href="Pound%20sterling">pound</a> (24 old pence), it was the last coin circulating immediately prior to <a href="Decimal%20Day">decimalisation</a> to be demonetised, in 1993, having for a quarter of a century circulated alongside the <a href="ten%20pence%20piece">ten pence piece</a>, identical in specifications and value.

The florin was introduced as part of an experiment in decimalisation that went no further at that time. The original florins, dated 1849, attracted controversy for omitting a reference to God from <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>'s titles; that type is accordingly known as the "Godless florin", and was in 1851 succeeded by the "Gothic florin", for its design and style of lettering. Throughout most of its existence, the florin bore some variation of either the shields of the United Kingdom, or the emblems of its constituent nations on the <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">reverse</a>, a tradition broken between 1902 and 1910, when the coin featured a windswept figure of a standing <a href="Britannia">Britannia</a>.

In 1911, following the accession of <a href="George%20V">George V</a>, the florin regained the shields and sceptres design it had in the late <a href="Victorian%20Era">Victorian Era</a>, and kept that motif until 1937, when the national emblems were placed on it. The florin retained such a theme for the remainder of its run, though a new design was used from 1953, following the accession of <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a>. In 1968, prior to decimalisation, the Royal Mint began striking the ten pence piece. The old two shilling piece remained in circulation until the ten pence piece was made smaller, and earlier coins, including the florin, were demonetised.

The drive for <a href="decimalisation">decimalisation</a> of the currency in Britain dates as far back as 1682. Although nothing was done regarding early proposals, the adoption of a decimal currency in the United States, France and other nations in the late 18th and early 19th centuries renewed the call, and commissions in 1841 and 1843 called for its adoption. In 1847, a motion was introduced in Parliament by Sir <a href="John%20Bowring">John Bowring</a> calling for the introduction of a decimal currency and the striking of coins of one-tenth and one-hundredth of a <a href="Pound%20Sterling">pound</a>. Bowring obtained surprisingly strong support for his motion, and the <a href="Whig%20government%2C%201846%E2%80%931852">Russell government</a> promised that a coin valued at one-tenth of a pound (two shillings) would be produced to test public opinion, with consideration in future to be given to the introduction of other decimal coins.

There was much discussion about what the coin should be called—"centum", "decade", and "dime" being among the suggestions—before "florin" was eventually settled upon, not because of the old English coin of that name, but because the Netherlands had a florin, or gulden, of about that size and value.

 The first florins were struck in 1849. They were in the <a href="Gothic%20art">Gothic style</a>, and featured a portrait of <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> as a very young woman, with the crowned cruciform shields of the United Kingdom shown on the reverse, and the nations' emblems in the angles. The new florin closely resembles the Gothic crown of 1847; the obverse for both was designed by the <a href="Chief%20Engraver%20of%20the%20Royal%20Mint">Chief Engraver of the Royal Mint</a>, <a href="William%20Wyon">William Wyon</a>, while the reverse of both was designed by <a href="William%20Dyce">William Dyce</a>. Unlike the crown's Gothic script, the 1849 florin has Roman lettering. The 1849 florin, issued in silver, weighed 11.3 <a href="gram">gram</a>s and had a diameter of 28 millimetres. The new coin made clear its value with the inscription on the reverse. To aid in the decimal experiment, the half crown (two shillings and sixpence, or one-eighth of a pound), near to the florin in size and value, was not issued between 1850 and 1874, when it was struck again at the request of the banks, and surveys found that both coins played useful parts in commerce. Each would continue to be struck, and would circulate together, until decimalisation.

These first coins were probably a shock to the public, as for the first time in nearly 200 years a British coin featured a portrait of the monarch wearing a crown. Even more of a shock, including (allegedly) to Queen Victoria herself, was the inscription on the obverse, , omitting the usual for "Dei Gratia" (By the Grace of God) from the coin's inscription. This resulted in it being known as the "Godless florin". Further controversy was caused by the omission of the usual abbreviation for "Fidei Defensor" (Defender of <a href="Church%20of%20England">the Faith</a>): the <a href="Master%20of%20the%20Mint">Master of the Mint</a>, <a href="Richard%20Lalor%20Sheil">Richard Lalor Sheil</a>, an Irishman and a Roman Catholic, was suspected by some of plotting to overthrow the Protestant regime. The inscription had in fact been suggested by <a href="Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort">Albert, Prince Consort</a>, Victoria's husband. Sheil stated in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a> that the inscription had been a mistake, and the florin was redesigned for its next issue in 1851.

The revised florin's diameter was increased to 30 millimetres (the weight was unchanged), and all the lettering on the coin was in <a href="Blackletter">Gothic script</a>, resulting in it being known as the Gothic florin. The coin was by the same designers; its date was rendered in <a href="Roman%20numerals">Roman numerals</a>. The bust of Victoria and the heraldry on the reverse were largely unchanged. The Latin inscription on the obverse read with the date, while the reverse read . Despite a <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a>, the drive for decimalisation soon died out; there was only lukewarm support for an 1855 motion in the Commons applauding the issuance of the florin and seeking further decimal coins. The Gothic Florin was produced each year until 1887, excepting 1861 and 1882. From 1864 until 1879, many florins were struck with <a href="Coining%20%28mint%29">die</a> numbers on the obverse (found to the right of Victoria's brooch, possibly part of a Mint investigation into how long it took coinage dies to wear out. Beginning with some 1867 issues, on the obverse was rendered , following the Latin practice in abbreviations of doubling a final consonant for a plural. Thus, Victoria's title changed from "Queen of Britain" to "Queen of the Britains", including the colonies and other territories.

In 1887, as part of a coinage redesign for <a href="Golden%20Jubilee%20of%20Queen%20Victoria">Victoria's Golden Jubilee</a>, a new obverse design, showing the queen as an older woman, debuted on the gold and silver coinage. This was dubbed the "Jubilee Head" and was by Sir <a href="Joseph%20Boehm">Joseph Boehm</a>. The various flora were removed from the florin's reverse and were replaced by sceptres between the shields with a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter">Garter Star</a> in the centre. The Jubilee Head quickly proved unpopular, due in part to the crown worn by the Queen, which was deemed ridiculously small. The Jubilee florin shared its reverse with the short-lived <a href="double%20florin">double florin</a>, which Gertrude Rawlings in 1898 described as "radiating kitchen pokers and tea trays". The reverse design was created and engraved by <a href="Leonard%20Charles%20Wyon">Leonard Charles Wyon</a> (who also engraved the obverse), though it was probably influenced by the gold coinage of <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> designed by <a href="John%20Roettier">John Roettier</a>. The diameter was reduced to 29.5 millimetres. All the inscriptions were in Latin letters and <a href="Arabic%20numerals">Arabic numerals</a>. The inscription on the obverse read , while the reverse read , with no indication of the value. The Jubilee florin was struck each year between 1887 and 1892.
Given the unpopularity of the Jubilee bust, a committee was set up in February 1891 to recommend new designs. An obverse designed by <a href="Thomas%20Brock">Thomas Brock</a> was selected, and the committee also recommended some new reverses. This advisory committee recommended a different bust (also by Brock) be used on the florin to distinguish it from the half crown. The recommendation was not accepted, and the florin used the same "Veiled Head" or "Old Head" obverse that was introduced to the silver and gold coinage in 1893. To better distinguish it from the half crown, the diameter was reduced from 29 to 28.5 mm. The obverse was inscribed , together with a new reverse showing three shields separated by a rose, shamrock, and thistle (symbolising England, Scotland and Ireland) under a crown, and the inscription . This reverse was created by Sir <a href="Edward%20Poynter">Edward Poynter</a>, and was issued each year between 1893 and 1901, the year of Victoria's death.

Both sides of the florin were redesigned following the accession of Victoria's son, <a href="Edward%20VII">Edward VII</a>, each design being created by the Chief Engraver of the Royal Mint, <a href="George%20William%20de%20Saulles">George William de Saulles</a>. The florin of King Edward VII was minted every year from 1902 to 1910. Its specifications remained at 11.3 grams weight and 28.5 millimetres diameter. The obverse shows the right-facing head of the King, inscribed , while the other side features what "Coincraft's Standard Catalogue of English and UK Coins" deems "a most unusual and original reverse". It shows a windswept figure of <a href="Britannia">Britannia</a> standing holding a shield with her left hand and a trident with her right, and inscribed , with the date below. Peter Seaby, in his history of British coinage, described the figure of Britannia as "standing on some mythical ancient ship which could hardly be sea-worthy under her weight", but "a pleasing composition".

De Saulles created the new florin in this manner to distinguish the coin from the half crown, as there had been complaints of confusion. He probably based the design on his <a href="British%20trade%20dollar">British trade dollar</a> (1895). The sitter for the design was Susan Hicks-Beach, the daughter of <a href="Michael%20Hicks-Beach%2C%201st%20Earl%20St%20Aldwyn">Michael Hicks-Beach, 1st Earl St Aldwyn</a> who had served as Chancellor of the Exchequer and "ex officio" Master of the Mint. The modern-day Britannia coinage, bullion pieces struck by the Royal Mint for investors and collectors, has a reverse that strongly resembles that of the Edwardian florin.

Florins bearing a left-facing effigy of <a href="George%20V">George V</a> by Sir <a href="Bertram%20Mackennal">Bertram Mackennal</a> were minted in each year of the King's reign (1910–1936) except 1910 and 1934. The initial reverse design (1911–1926) was developed internally at the Royal Mint, and is intended to be that of the 1887 double florin, to which the Jubilee florin is very similar. The weight and diameter of the coin were unchanged but, because of rises in the price of silver, the metallic composition was changed in 1920 from 0.925 silver to 50% silver, 40% copper, 10% nickel, then again in 1922 to 50% silver, 50% copper, and again in 1927 to 50% silver, 40% copper, 5% nickel, 5% zinc. The changes in alloy after 1920 were due to the Mint trying to find a silver alloy that would remain attractive as it wore. The inscriptions on the obverse of the original version of the George V florin were and on the reverse were and the year of striking.

The modified florin, dated 1927 to 1936, was designed by <a href="George%20Kruger%20Gray">George Kruger Gray</a> and did not greatly alter the design of shields and sceptres, but removed the crowns from the shields and placed them on the sceptres. A "G", the King's initial, is at the centre of the design. The obverse inscription became and the reverse one was with the date and denomination . The bust of the King on the obverse was slightly modified in 1927.

Throughout 1936, the year in which <a href="Edward%20VIII">Edward VIII</a> reigned, coins of all denominations continued to be struck using the designs of George V, pending preparation of the new monarch's coinage. No coins depicting Edward VIII were officially released to circulation. A pattern florin exists for King Edward, which would have been due to receive approval around the time that the King abdicated in December 1936. Although there is a tradition of alternating the direction the monarch faces with each reign, and George V had faced left, Edward believed that side more flattering. Thus, the obverse depicts the left-facing effigy of the King by <a href="Thomas%20Humphrey%20Paget">Thomas Humphrey Paget</a> inscribed . The reverse, by Kruger Gray, shows a crowned rose flanked by a thistle and shamrock, with E below the thistle and R below the shamrock, and the inscription and .

<a href="George%20VI">King George VI</a>'s florin, produced each year between 1937 and 1951, looks very much like the one planned for his brother Edward VIII. Like on the patterns for King Edward, the words are omitted; they would remain absent for the coin's remaining existence. The obverse, by Thomas Humphrey Paget, shows the left-facing effigy of the King inscribed . The reverse, by Kruger Gray, depicts a crowned rose with a thistle and shamrock on either side. There is a G below the thistle and R below the shamrock, and the inscription until 1948. From 1949, the coins were struck without the , in acknowledgement of <a href="India">India</a>'s independence. From 1947, the metal content was changed, as for all British silver circulating coins, to 75% copper, 25% nickel. This was due to the need for Britain to return <a href="Lend-Lease">Lend-Lease</a> silver to the United States. The florin's diameter and weight remained unchanged at 11.3 grams and 28.5 millimetres, despite the change of alloy.

Florins were produced for <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> each year between 1953 and 1967, with proof coins struck that were dated 1970. The obverse shows the <a href="Mary%20Gillick">Mary Gillick</a> head of Queen Elizabeth, inscribed (1953 only) or (all other years). This change was made to acknowledge the evolving <a href="British%20Commonwealth">British Commonwealth</a>, which by then contained some republics. The reverse, by Edgar Fuller and Cecil Thomas, depicts a <a href="Tudor%20rose">Tudor rose</a> in the centre surrounded by thistles, shamrocks and leeks, with the Latin phrase , the denomination and the date. The designs were selected by the Royal Mint Advisory Committee following a public competition. The artists' initials appear either side of the Welsh leek at the bottom of the reverse. When the reverse of the new coin was illustrated in the press, there was no consensus as to which way was up; <a href="Numismatist%20%28specialist%29">numismatist</a> H.W.A. Linecar has noted that the second in marks the bottom of the coin.

In accordance with the plan for decimalisation of the currency (120 years after this denomination was first introduced in the initial plan to introduce a decimal currency), from 1968 the <a href="Ten%20pence%20%28British%20coin%29">ten pence</a> coin was introduced of the same size, weight and metal composition as the florin. Thus, the florin ceased to be struck for circulation after the 1967-dated pieces. The new and the old circulated side by side as florins prior to <a href="Decimal%20Day">Decimal Day</a> (15 February 1971) and as ten pence pieces after.

Florins (usually dated 1947 or later) remained in circulation after Decimal Day. In 1987, following a study of the currency, the <a href="Third%20Thatcher%20ministry">Thatcher government</a> announced its intent to issue a new ten pence piece, reduced in size. A smaller ten pence piece was issued in 1992, after which the old florin was demonetised on 30 June 1993. The florin, the first decimal coin, was the last coin in general circulation just prior to decimalisation to be withdrawn.

Achtung Baby

Achtung Baby () is the seventh studio album by Irish <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="U2">U2</a>. It was produced by <a href="Daniel%20Lanois">Daniel Lanois</a> and <a href="Brian%20Eno">Brian Eno</a>, and was released on 18 November 1991 on <a href="Island%20Records">Island Records</a>. Stung by criticism of their 1988 release, "<a href="Rattle%20and%20Hum">Rattle and Hum</a>", U2 shifted their musical direction to incorporate influences from <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a>, <a href="industrial%20music">industrial music</a>, and <a href="electronic%20dance%20music">electronic dance music</a> into their sound. Thematically, "Achtung Baby" is darker, more introspective, and at times more flippant than their previous work. The album and the subsequent multimedia-intensive <a href="Zoo%20TV%20Tour">Zoo TV Tour</a> were central to the group's 1990s reinvention, by which they abandoned their earnest public image for a more lighthearted and self-deprecating one.

Seeking inspiration from <a href="German%20reunification">German reunification</a>, U2 began recording "Achtung Baby" at Berlin's <a href="Hansa%20Studios">Hansa Studios</a> in October 1990. The sessions were fraught with conflict, as the band argued over their musical direction and the quality of their material. After tensions and slow progress nearly prompted the group to disband, they made a breakthrough with the improvised writing of the song "<a href="One%20%28U2%20song%29">One</a>". Morale and productivity improved during subsequent recording sessions in Dublin, where the album was completed in 1991. To confound the public's expectations of the band and their music, U2 chose the record's facetious title and colourful multi-image sleeve.

"Achtung Baby" is one of U2's most successful records; it received favourable reviews and debuted at number one on the US <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200 Top Albums</a>, while topping the charts in many other countries. Five songs were released as commercial singles, all of which were chart successes, including "One", "<a href="Mysterious%20Ways%20%28song%29">Mysterious Ways</a>", and "<a href="The%20Fly%20%28song%29">The Fly</a>". The album has sold 18 million copies worldwide and won a <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a> in <a href="35th%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">1993</a> for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Rock%20Performance%20by%20a%20Duo%20or%20Group%20with%20Vocal">Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal</a>. "Achtung Baby" has since been acclaimed by writers and music critics as one of the greatest albums of all time. The record was <a href="reissue">reissue</a>d in October 2011 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of its original release.

After U2's 1987 album "<a href="The%20Joshua%20Tree">The Joshua Tree</a>" and the supporting <a href="Joshua%20Tree%20Tour">Joshua Tree Tour</a> brought them critical acclaim and commercial success, their 1988 album and film "<a href="Rattle%20and%20Hum">Rattle and Hum</a>" precipitated a critical backlash. Although the record sold 14 million copies and performed well on music charts, critics were dismissive of it and the film, labelling the band's exploration of early <a href="American%20popular%20music">American music</a> as "pretentious" and "misguided and bombastic". U2's high exposure and their reputation for being overly serious led to accusations of grandiosity and self-righteousness.

Despite their commercial popularity, the group were dissatisfied creatively; lead vocalist <a href="Bono">Bono</a> believed they were musically unprepared for their success, while drummer <a href="Larry%20Mullen%2C%20Jr.">Larry Mullen, Jr.</a> said, "We were the biggest, but we weren't the best." By the band's 1989 <a href="Lovetown%20Tour">Lovetown Tour</a>, they had become bored with playing their greatest hits. U2 believe that audiences misunderstood the group's collaboration with <a href="blues">blues</a> musician <a href="B.B.%20King">B.B. King</a> on "Rattle and Hum" and the Lovetown Tour, and they described it as "an excursion down a dead-end street". Bono said that, in retrospect, listening to <a href="African-American%20music">black music</a> enabled the group to create a work such as "Achtung Baby", while their experiences with <a href="folk%20music">folk music</a> helped him to develop as a lyricist. Towards the end of the Lovetown Tour, Bono announced on-stage that it was "the end of something for U2", and that "we have to go away and ... dream it all up again". Following the tour, the group began, what was at the time, their longest break from public performances and album releases.

Reacting to their own sense of musical stagnation and to their critics, U2 searched for new musical ground. They wrote "<a href="God%20Part%20II">God Part II</a>" from "Rattle and Hum" after realising they had excessively pursued nostalgia in their songwriting. The song had a more contemporary feel that Bono said was closer to "Achtung Baby"s direction. Further indications of change were two recordings they made in 1990: the first was a cover version of "<a href="Night%20and%20Day%20%28song%29">Night and Day</a>" for the first "<a href="Red%20Hot%20%2B%20Blue">Red Hot + Blue</a>" release, in which U2 used <a href="electronic%20dance%20music">electronic dance</a> beats and <a href="Hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a> elements for the first time; the second indication of change was contributions made by Bono and guitarist <a href="the%20Edge">the Edge</a> to the original score of "<a href="A%20Clockwork%20Orange%20%28novel%29">A Clockwork Orange</a>"s stage adaptation. Much of the material they wrote was experimental, and according to Bono, "prepar[ed] the ground for "Achtung Baby"". Ideas deemed inappropriate for the play were put aside for the band's use. During this period, Bono and the Edge began increasingly writing songs together without Mullen or bassist <a href="Adam%20Clayton">Adam Clayton</a>.

In mid-1990, Bono reviewed material he had written in Australia on the Lovetown Tour, and the group recorded <a href="Demo%20%28music%29">demo</a>s at STS Studios in Dublin. The demos later evolved into the songs "<a href="Who%27s%20Gonna%20Ride%20Your%20Wild%20Horses">Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses</a>", "<a href="Until%20the%20End%20of%20the%20World%20%28song%29">Until the End of the World</a>", "<a href="Even%20Better%20Than%20the%20Real%20Thing">Even Better Than the Real Thing</a>", and "<a href="Mysterious%20Ways%20%28song%29">Mysterious Ways</a>". After their time at STS Studios, Bono and the Edge were tasked with continuing to work on lyrics and melodies until the group reconvened. Going into the album sessions, U2 wanted the record to completely deviate from their past work, but they were unsure how to achieve this. The emergence of the <a href="Madchester">Madchester</a> scene in the UK left them confused about how they would fit into any particular musical scene.
U2 hired <a href="Daniel%20Lanois">Daniel Lanois</a> and <a href="Brian%20Eno">Brian Eno</a> to <a href="record%20producer">produce</a> the album, based on the duo's prior work with the band on "<a href="The%20Unforgettable%20Fire">The Unforgettable Fire</a>" and "The Joshua Tree". Lanois was principal producer, with <a href="Flood%20%28producer%29">Mark "Flood" Ellis</a> as <a href="Audio%20engineer">engineer</a>. Eno took on an assisting role, working with the group in the studio for a week at a time to review their songs before leaving for a month or two. Eno said his role was "to come in and erase anything that sounded too much like U2". By distancing himself from the work, he believed he provided the band with a fresh perspective on their material each time he rejoined them. As he explained, "I would deliberately not listen to the stuff in between visits, so I could go in cold". Since U2 wanted the record to be harder-hitting and live-sounding, Lanois "push[ed] the performance aspect very hard, often to the point of recklessness". The Lanois–Eno team used <a href="lateral%20thinking">lateral thinking</a> and a philosophical approach—popularised by Eno's <a href="Oblique%20Strategies">Oblique Strategies</a>—that contrasted with the direct and retro style of "Rattle and Hum" producer <a href="Jimmy%20Iovine">Jimmy Iovine</a>.

The band believed that "domesticity [w]as the enemy of rock 'n' roll" and that to work on the album, they needed to remove themselves from their normal family-oriented routines. With a "<a href="New%20Europe%20%28political%20expression%29">New Europe</a>" emerging at the end of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, they chose Berlin, in the centre of the reuniting continent, as a source of inspiration for a more European musical aesthetic. They chose to record at <a href="Hansa%20Studios">Hansa Studios</a> in <a href="West%20Berlin">West Berlin</a>, near the recently opened <a href="Berlin%20Wall">Berlin Wall</a>. Several acclaimed records were made at Hansa, including two from <a href="David%20Bowie">David Bowie</a>'s "Berlin Trilogy" with Eno, and <a href="Iggy%20Pop">Iggy Pop</a>'s "<a href="The%20Idiot%20%28album%29">The Idiot</a>". U2 arrived on 3 October 1990 on the last flight into <a href="East%20Berlin">East Berlin</a> on the eve of <a href="German%20reunification">German reunification</a>. While looking for public celebrations, they mistakenly ended up joining an anti-unification protest by <a href="Communism">Communists</a>. Expecting to be inspired in Berlin, U2 instead found the city to be depressing and gloomy. The collapse of the Berlin Wall had resulted in a state of malaise in Germany. The band found their East Berlin hotel to be dismal and the winter inhospitable, while Hansa Studios' location in an <a href="Schutzstaffel">SS</a> ballroom added to the "bad vibe". Complicating matters, the studios had been neglected for years, forcing Eno and Lanois to import recording equipment.
Morale worsened once the sessions commenced, as the band worked long days but could not agree on a musical direction. The Edge had been listening to electronic dance music and to <a href="industrial%20music">industrial</a> bands like <a href="Einst%C3%BCrzende%20Neubauten">Einstürzende Neubauten</a>, <a href="Nine%20Inch%20Nails">Nine Inch Nails</a>, <a href="the%20Young%20Gods">the Young Gods</a>, and <a href="KMFDM">KMFDM</a>. He and Bono advocated new musical directions along these lines. In contrast, Mullen was listening to <a href="classic%20rock">classic rock</a> acts such as <a href="Blind%20Faith">Blind Faith</a>, <a href="Cream%20%28band%29">Cream</a>, and <a href="Jimi%20Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a>, and he was learning how to "play around the beat". Like Clayton, he was more comfortable with a sound similar to U2's previous work and was resistant to the proposed innovations. Further, the Edge's interest in dance club mixes and <a href="drum%20machine">drum machine</a>s made Mullen feel that his contributions as a drummer were being diminished. Lanois was expecting the "textural and emotional and cinematic U2" of "The Unforgettable Fire" and "The Joshua Tree", and he did not understand the "throwaway, trashy kinds of things" on which Bono and the Edge were working. Compounding the divisions between the two camps was a change in the band's longstanding songwriting relationship; Bono and the Edge were working more closely together, writing material in isolation from the rest of the group.

U2 found that they were neither prepared nor well-rehearsed, and that their ideas were not evolving into completed songs. The group were unable to reach consensus during their disagreements and felt that they were not making progress. Bono and Lanois, in particular, had an argument that almost came to blows during the writing of "Mysterious Ways". During one tense session, Clayton removed his bass guitar and held it out to Bono, saying, "You tell me what to play and I'll play it. You want to play it yourself? Go ahead." With a sense of going nowhere, the band considered breaking up. Eno visited for a few days, and understanding their attempts to deconstruct the band, he assured them that their progress was better than they thought. By adding unusual effects and sounds, he showed that the Edge's pursuit for new sonic territory was not incompatible with Mullen's and Lanois' "desire to hold on to solid song structures". Ultimately, a breakthrough was achieved with the writing of the song "<a href="One%20%28U2%20song%29">One</a>". While working on "Sick Puppy"—an early version of "Mysterious Ways"—The Edge played two separate <a href="chord%20progression">chord progression</a>s sequentially on guitar at Lanois' encouragement, and finding inspiration, the group quickly improvised a new song that became "One". It provided reassurance and validated their long-standing "blank page approach" to writing and recording together.

U2 returned to Dublin for Christmas, where they discussed their future together and all recommitted to the group. Listening to the tapes, they agreed their material sounded better than they originally thought. They briefly returned to Berlin in January 1991 to finish their work at Hansa. Reflecting on their time in Berlin, Clayton called the sessions a "<a href="baptism%20of%20fire">baptism of fire</a>" and said, "It was something we had to go through to realize what we were trying to get to was not something you could find physically, outside of ourselves, in some other city—that there was not magic to it and that we actually had to put the work in and figure out the ideas and hone those ideas down." Although just two songs were delivered during their two months in Berlin, the Edge said that in retrospect, working there had been more productive and inspirational than the output had suggested. The band had been removed from a familiar environment, providing what they described as a certain "texture and cinematic location", and many of their incomplete ideas would be revisited in the subsequent Dublin sessions with success.

In February 1991, U2 moved the album's recording sessions to the seaside manor Elsinore in the Dublin suburb of <a href="Dalkey">Dalkey</a>, renting the house for ₤10,000 per month. The band nicknamed the house "Dog Town" for the "tackiness" of its exterior dog kennels, and the location was credited as such in the album notes. Lanois' strategy to record in houses, mansions, or castles was something he believed brought atmosphere to the recordings. Dublin audio services company Big Bear Sound installed a recording studio in the house, with the recording room in a converted garage diagonally beneath the control room. Video cameras and TV monitors were used to monitor and communicate between the spaces. With Elsinore located within walking distance of Bono's and the Edge's homes, the sessions there were more relaxed and productive. The band struggled with one particular song—later released as the B-side "Lady With the Spinning Head"—but three separate tracks, "<a href="The%20Fly%20%28song%29">The Fly</a>", "<a href="Ultraviolet%20%28Light%20My%20Way%29">Ultraviolet (Light My Way)</a>" and "<a href="Zoo%20Station%20%28song%29">Zoo Station</a>", were derived from it. During the writing of "The Fly", Bono created a <a href="persona">persona</a> based on an oversized pair of black sunglasses that he wore to lighten the mood in the studio. The character, also named "The Fly", evolved into a leather-clad egomaniac meant to parody rock stardom. Bono assumed this alter ego for the band's subsequent public appearances and live performances on the <a href="Zoo%20TV%20Tour">Zoo TV Tour</a>.

In April, tapes from the earlier Berlin sessions were stolen after the band reportedly left them in a hotel room, and they were subsequently leaked before the album was finished. The tapes' demos were <a href="Bootleg%20recording">bootlegged</a> into a three-disc collection dubbed the "Salome - The [Axtung Beibi] Outtakes", named for a song that was prominently featured in the collection but did not make the album's final cut. The release is considered the most famous bootleg of U2 material. Bono dismissed the leaked demos as "<a href="gobbledygook">gobbledygook</a>", and the Edge likened the situation to "being violated". The leak shook U2's confidence and soured their collective mood for a few weeks.

Staffing schedules led to the band having a surplus of engineers at one point, and as a result, they split recording between Elsinore and the Edge's home studio to increase productivity. Engineer Robbie Adams said the approach raised morale and activity levels: "There was always something different to listen to, always something exciting happening." To record all of the band's material and test different arrangements, the engineers utilised a technique they called "fatting", which allowed them to achieve more than 48 tracks of audio by using a 24-track <a href="analogue%20recording">analogue recording</a>, a <a href="Digital%20Audio%20Tape">DAT</a> machine, and a synchroniser. The focus on capturing the band's material and encouraging the best performances meant that little attention was paid to combating <a href="Spill%20%28audio%29">audio spill</a>. In issue 14 of U2's fan magazine "Propaganda", Lanois said that he believed some of the in-progress songs would become worldwide hits, despite lyrics and vocal takes being unfinished.

During the Dublin sessions, Eno was sent tapes of the previous two months' work, which he called a "total disaster". Joining U2 in the studio, he stripped away what he thought to be excessive <a href="overdubbing">overdubbing</a>. The group believes his intervention saved the album. Eno theorised that the band was too close to their music, explaining, "if you know a piece of music terribly well and the mix changes and the bass guitar goes very quiet, you still hear the bass. You're so accustomed to it being there that you compensate and remake it in your mind." Eno also assisted them through a crisis point one month before the recording deadline; he recalled that "everything seemed like a mess", and he insisted the band take a two-week holiday. The break gave them a clearer perspective and added decisiveness.

After work at Elsinore finished in July, the sessions moved to <a href="Windmill%20Lane%20Studios">Windmill Lane Studios</a> where Eno, Flood, Lanois, and previous U2 producer <a href="Steve%20Lillywhite">Steve Lillywhite</a> <a href="audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mixed</a> the tracks. Each producer created his own mixes of the songs, and the band either picked the version they preferred or requested that certain aspects of each be combined. Additional recording and mixing continued at a frenetic pace until the 21 September deadline, including last-minute changes to "The Fly", "One", and "Mysterious Ways". The Edge estimated that half of the sessions' work was done in the last three weeks to finalise songs. The final night was spent devising a running order for the record. The following day, the Edge travelled to Los Angeles with the album's tapes for <a href="Audio%20mastering">mastering</a>.

U2 is credited with composing the music for all of "Achtung Baby"s tracks, despite periods of separated songwriting. They wrote the music primarily through <a href="jam%20session">jam session</a>s, a common practice for them. The album represents a deviation from the sound of their past work; the songs are less anthemic in nature, and their musical style demonstrates a more European aesthetic, introducing influences from <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a>, industrial music, and electronic dance music. The band referred to the album's musical departure as "the sound of four men chopping down The Joshua Tree". Accordingly, the distorted <a href="introduction%20%28music%29">introduction</a> to the opening track "<a href="Zoo%20Station%20%28song%29">Zoo Station</a>" was intended to make listeners think the record was broken or was mistakenly not the new U2 album. Author Susan Fast said that with the group's use of technology in the song's opening, "there can be no mistake that U2 has embraced sound resources new to them".

For the album, the Edge often <a href="wikt%3Aeschew">eschewed</a> his normally minimalistic approach to guitar playing and his trademark chiming, <a href="Delay%20%28audio%20effect%29">delay</a>-heavy sound, in favour of a style that incorporated more <a href="guitar%20solo">solos</a>, <a href="Consonance%20and%20dissonance">dissonance</a>, and <a href="audio%20feedback">feedback</a>. Industrial influences and guitar effects, particularly <a href="distortion%20%28music%29">distortion</a>, contributed to a "metallic" style and "harder textures". Music journalist Bill Wyman said the Edge's guitar playing on the closing track "<a href="Love%20Is%20Blindness">Love Is Blindness</a>" sounded like a "dentist's drill". The Edge achieved breakthroughs in the writing of songs such as "<a href="Even%20Better%20Than%20the%20Real%20Thing">Even Better Than the Real Thing</a>" and "<a href="Mysterious%20Ways%20%28song%29">Mysterious Ways</a>" by toying with various <a href="Effects%20unit">effects pedals</a>.

The rhythm section is more pronounced in the mix on "Achtung Baby", and hip hop-inspired electronic dance beats are featured on many of the album's tracks, most prominently "<a href="The%20Fly%20%28song%29">The Fly</a>". Elysa Gardner of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" compared the layering of dance beats into guitar-heavy mixes to songs by British bands <a href="Happy%20Mondays">Happy Mondays</a> and <a href="Jesus%20Jones">Jesus Jones</a>. "Mysterious Ways" combines a funky guitar riff with a danceable, <a href="conga">conga</a>-laden beat, for what Bono called "U2 at our funkiest... <a href="Sly%20and%20The%20Family%20Stone">Sly and The Family Stone</a> meets Madchester <a href="baggy">baggy</a>." Amidst layers of distorted guitars, "The Fly" and "Zoo Station" feature industrial-influenced percussion—the <a href="timbre">timbre</a> of Mullen's drums exhibits a "cold, processed sound, something like beating on a tin can", according to author Albin Zak.

Whereas Bono exhibited a full-throated vocal delivery on the group's previous releases, for "Achtung Baby" he extended his range into a lower <a href="vocal%20register">register</a> and used what Fast described as "breathy and subdued colors". On many tracks, including "The Fly" and "Zoo Station", he sang as a character; one technique used is what Fast called "double voice", in which the vocals are doubled but sung in two different <a href="octave">octave</a>s. This octave differentiation was sometimes done with vocals simultaneously, while at other times, it distinguishes voices between the verses and choruses. According to Fast, the technique introduces "a contrasting lyrical idea and vocal character to deliver it", leading to both literal and ironic interpretations of Bono's vocals. For several tracks, his vocals were treated with <a href="Audio%20signal%20processing">processing</a>. These techniques were used to give his voice a different emotional feel and distinguish it from his past vocals.

As is often the case on U2 albums, Bono is credited as the sole lyricist. In contrast to U2's previous records, whose lyrics were politically and socially charged, "Achtung Baby" is more personal and introspective, examining love, sexuality, spirituality, faith, and betrayal. The lyrics are darker in tone, describing troubled personal relationships and exuding feelings of confusion, loneliness, and inadequacy. Central to these themes was the Edge's separation from his wife (the mother of his three children), which occurred halfway through the album's recording. The pain not only focused him on the record and led him to advocate more personal themes, but it also affected Bono's lyrical contributions. Bono found inspiration from his own personal life, citing the births of his two daughters in 1989 and 1991 as major influences. This is reflected in "Zoo Station", which opens the album as a statement of intent with lyrics suggesting new anticipations and appetites.

Of the album's personal nature, Bono said that there were a lot of "blood and guts" in it. His lyrics to the ballad "<a href="One%20%28U2%20song%29">One</a>" were inspired by the band members' struggling relationships and the German reunification. The Edge described the song on one level as a "bitter, twisted, vitriolic conversation between two people who've been through some nasty, heavy stuff". Similarly, "<a href="Ultraviolet%20%28Light%20My%20Way%29">Ultraviolet (Light My Way)</a>" describes a strained relationship and unease over obligations, and on "<a href="Acrobat%20%28song%29">Acrobat</a>", Bono sings about weakness, hypocrisy, and inadequacy. The <a href="torch%20songs">torch songs</a> of <a href="Roy%20Orbison">Roy Orbison</a>, <a href="Scott%20Walker%20%28singer%29">Scott Walker</a>, and <a href="Jacques%20Brel">Jacques Brel</a> were major influences, evidenced by tracks such as: "<a href="Who%27s%20Gonna%20Ride%20Your%20Wild%20Horses">Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses</a>", a description of a couple's argument; "<a href="So%20Cruel">So Cruel</a>", about unrequited love, obsession, and possessiveness; and the closing track, "Love Is Blindness", a bleak account of a failing romance.

U2 biographer <a href="Bill%20Flanagan">Bill Flanagan</a> credits Bono's habit of keeping his lyrics "in flux until the last minute" with providing a narrative coherence to the album. Flanagan interpreted "Achtung Baby" as using the moon as a metaphor for a dark woman seducing the singer away from his virtuous love, the sun; he is tempted away from domestic life by an exciting nightlife and tests how far he can go before returning home. For Flanagan, "<a href="Tryin%27%20to%20Throw%20Your%20Arms%20Around%20the%20World">Tryin' to Throw Your Arms Around the World</a>" on the album's latter third describes the character stumbling home in a drunken state, and the final three songs—"Ultraviolet (Light My Way)", "Acrobat", and "Love Is Blindness"—are about how the couple deal with the suffering they have forced on each other.

Despite the record's darker themes, many lyrics are more flippant and sexual than those from the band's previous work. This reflects the group's revisiting some of the <a href="Dada">Dada</a>ist characters and stage antics they dabbled with in the late 1970s as teenagers but abandoned for more literal themes in the 1980s. While the band had previously been opposed to <a href="materialism">materialism</a>, they examined and flirted with this value on the album and the Zoo TV Tour. The title and lyrics of "Even Better Than the Real Thing" are "reflective of the times [the band] were living in, when people were no longer looking for the truth, [they] were all looking for instant gratification". "Trashy" and "throwaway" were among the band's buzzwords during recording, leading to many tracks in this vein. The chorus of "Ultraviolet (Light My Way)" features the pop lyrical cliché "baby, baby, baby", juxtaposed against the dark lyrics in the verses. Bono wrote the lyrics to "The Fly" in character as the song's eponymous persona by composing a sequence of <a href="aphorism">aphorism</a>s. He called the song "like a crank call from Hell... but [the caller] likes it there".

Religious imagery is present throughout the record. "<a href="Until%20the%20End%20of%20the%20World%20%28song%29">Until the End of the World</a>" is an imagined conversation between <a href="Jesus%20Christ">Jesus Christ</a> and his betrayer, <a href="Judas%20Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a>. On "Acrobat", Bono sings about feelings of spiritual alienation in the line "I'd <a href="Eucharist">break bread and wine</a> / If there was a church I could receive in". In many tracks, Bono's lyrics about women carry religious connotations, describing them as spirits, life, light, and idols to be worshipped. Religious interpretations of the album are the subject of the book "Meditations on Love in the Shadow of the Fall" from the "<a href="33%E2%85%93">33⅓</a>" series.

The sleeve artwork for "Achtung Baby" was designed by <a href="Steve%20Averill">Steve Averill</a>, who had created the majority of U2's album covers, along with Shaughn McGrath. To parallel the band's change in musical direction, Averill and McGrath devised sleeve concepts that used multiple colour images to contrast with the seriousness of the individual, mostly monochromatic images from previous U2 album sleeves. Rough sketches and designs were created early during the recording sessions, and some experimental designs were conceived to closely resemble, as Averill put it, "dance-music oriented sleeves. We just did them to show how extreme we could go and then everyone came back to levels that they were happy with. But if we hadn't gone to these extremes it may not have been the cover it is now."

An initial photo shoot with the band's long-time photographer <a href="Anton%20Corbijn">Anton Corbijn</a> was done near U2's Berlin hotel in late 1990. Most of the photos were black-and-white, and the group felt they were not indicative of the spirit of the new album. They recommissioned Corbijn for an additional two-week photo shoot in <a href="Tenerife">Tenerife</a> in February 1991, for which they dressed up and mingled with the crowds of the annual <a href="Carnival%20of%20Santa%20Cruz%20de%20Tenerife">Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife</a>, presenting a more playful side of themselves. It was during the group's time in Tenerife and during a four-day shoot in <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a> in July that they were photographed in <a href="drag%20%28clothing%29">drag</a>. Additional photos were taken in Dublin in June, including a shot of a naked Clayton. The images were intended to confound expectations of U2, and their full colour contrasted with the monochromatic imagery on past sleeves.
Several photographs were considered as candidates for a single cover image, including shots of: a cow on an Irish farm in <a href="County%20Kildare">County Kildare</a>; the nude Clayton; and the band driving a <a href="Trabant">Trabant</a>, an East German automobile they became fond of as a symbol for a changing Europe. Ultimately, a multiple image scheme was used, as U2, Corbijn, Averill, and the producers thought that "the sense of flux expressed by both the music and the band's playing with alter egos was best articulated by the lack of a single viewpoint". The resulting front sleeve is a 4×4 squared montage. A mix of Corbijn's original images from Berlin and the later photo shoots was used, as the band wanted to balance the "colder European feel of the mainly black-and-white Berlin images with the much warmer exotic climates of Santa Cruz and Morocco". Some photographs were used because they were striking on their own, while others were used because of their ambiguity. Images of the band with Trabants, several of which were painted bright colours, appear on the sleeve and throughout the album booklet. These vehicles were later incorporated into the Zoo TV Tour set design as part of the lighting system. The nude photo of Clayton was placed on the rear cover of the record. On the US <a href="compact%20disc">compact disc</a> and <a href="Compact%20Cassette">cassette</a> sleeves, Clayton's genitals are censored with a black "X" or a <a href="four-leaf%20clover">four-leaf clover</a>, while <a href="vinyl%20record">vinyl</a> editions feature the photo uncensored. The label of the physical CD and vinyl record features an image of a "babyface" <a href="graffiti">graffiti</a>ed by artist Charlie Whisker onto an external wall of Windmill Lane Studios. The babyface image was later adopted as a logo for Zoo TV Tour memorabilia and was incorporated into the "<a href="Zooropa">Zooropa</a>" album cover. In 2003, music television network <a href="VH1">VH1</a> ranked "Achtung Baby"s sleeve at number 39 on its list of the "50 Greatest Album Covers". Bono has called the sleeve his favourite U2 cover artwork.

The German word "Achtung" () in the album title translates into English as "attention" or "watch out". U2's sound engineer Joe O'Herlihy used the phrase "achtung baby" during recording, reportedly taking it from the <a href="Mel%20Brooks">Mel Brooks</a> film "<a href="The%20Producers%20%281968%20film%29">The Producers</a>". The title was selected in August 1991 near the end of the album sessions. According to Bono, it was an ideal title, as it was attention-grabbing, referenced Germany, and hinted at either romance or birth, both of which were themes on the album. The band were determined not to highlight the seriousness of the lyrics and instead sought to "erect a mask" with the title, a concept that was further developed on the Zoo TV Tour, particularly through Bono's characters such as "The Fly". Of the title, he said in 1992, "It's a con, in a way. We call it "Achtung Baby", grinning up our sleeves in all the photography. But it's probably the heaviest record we've ever made... It tells you a lot about packaging, because the press would have killed us if we'd called it anything else."

U2 considered several other titles for the album, including "Man" (in contrast to the group's debut, "<a href="Boy%20%28album%29">Boy</a>"), "69", "Zoo Station", and "Adam", the latter of which would have been paired with the nude photo of Clayton. Other titles in consideration included "Fear of Women" and "Cruise Down Main Street", the latter a reference to <a href="the%20Rolling%20Stones">the Rolling Stones</a>' record "<a href="Exile%20on%20Main%20St.">Exile on Main St.</a>" and the cruise missiles launched on <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> during the <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a>. Most of the proposed titles were rejected out of the belief that people would see them as pretentious and "another Big Statement from U2".
As early as December 1990, the music press reported that U2 would be recording a dance-oriented album and that it would be released in mid-1991. In August 1991, <a href="sound%20collage">sound collage</a> artists <a href="Negativland">Negativland</a> released an <a href="Extended%20play">EP</a> entitled "<a href="U2%20%28EP%29">U2</a>" that parodied U2's song "<a href="I%20Still%20Haven%27t%20Found%20What%20I%27m%20Looking%20For">I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For</a>". <a href="Island%20Records">Island Records</a> objected to the release, believing consumers would confuse the EP for a new U2 record. Island successfully sued for copyright infringement but were criticised in the music press, as were U2, although they were not involved in the litigation. "<a href="Uncut%20%28magazine%29">Uncut</a>"s Stephen Dalton believes that the negative headlines were tempered by the success of "Achtung Baby"s first single, "The Fly", released on 21 October 1991 a month before the album. Sounding nothing like U2's typical style, it was selected as the lead single to announce the group's new musical direction. It became their second song to top the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a>, while reaching number one on the singles charts in Ireland and Australia. The single was less successful in the US, peaking at number 61 on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a>.

Island Records and U2 refused to make <a href="advance%20copy">advance copies</a> of the album available to the press until just a few days before the release date, preferring that fans listen to the record before reading reviews. The decision came amid rumours of tensions within the band, and journalist <a href="David%20Browne%20%28journalist%29">David Browne</a> compared it to the Hollywood practice of withholding pre-release copies of films from reviewers whenever they receive poor word-of-mouth press. "Achtung Baby" was released on 18 November 1991 in the UK and 19 November in the US on compact disc, tape cassette, and vinyl record, with an initial shipment of more than 1.4 million copies in the US. The album was the first release by a major act to use two so-called "<a href="eco-friendly">eco-friendly</a>" packages—the cardboard <a href="Digipak">Digipak</a>, and the <a href="shrinkwrap">shrinkwrap</a>ped <a href="jewel%20case">jewel case</a> without the <a href="longbox">longbox</a> cardboard attachment. Island encouraged record stores to order the jewel case packaging by offering a four-percent discount.

"Achtung Baby" was U2's first album in three years and their first comprising entirely new material in over four years. The group maintained a low profile after the record's release, avoiding interviews and allowing critics and the public to make their own assessments. Instead of participating in an article with "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine, U2 asked Eno to write one for them. The marketing plan for the album focused on retail and press promotions. In addition to television and radio advertisements being produced, posters featuring the sleeve's 16 images were distributed to record stores and through <a href="alternative%20newspaper">alternative newspaper</a>s in major cities. Compared to the large hype of other 1991 year-end releases, the marketing for "Achtung Baby" was relatively understated, as Island general manager Andy Allen explained: "U2 will not come out with that kind of fanfare in terms of outside media. We feel the fan base itself creates that kind of excitement."

"Mysterious Ways" was released as the second single five days after the release of "Achtung Baby". On the US <a href="Billboard%20charts">"Billboard" charts</a>, the song topped the <a href="Alternative%20Songs">Modern Rock Tracks</a> and <a href="Hot%20Mainstream%20Rock%20Tracks">Album Rock Tracks</a> charts, and it reached number nine on the Hot 100. Elsewhere, it reached number one in Canada and number three in Australia. In addition to the success of the first two singles, the album performed well commercially; in the US, "Achtung Baby" debuted at number one on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200 Top Albums</a> on 7 December 1991, having sold 295,000 copies in its first week. The album fell to number three the following week, but spent its first 13 weeks on the chart within the top ten. In total, it spent 101 weeks on the "Billboard" 200 Top Albums. On 21 January 1992, the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA) <a href="RIAA%20certification">certified</a> it double-platinum. "Achtung Baby" peaked at number two on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a>, spending 92 weeks on the chart. In other regions, it topped the <a href="RPM%20%28magazine%29">"RPM" 100</a> in Canada, the <a href="ARIA%20Charts">ARIA Albums Chart</a> in Australia, and the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20New%20Zealand">RIANZ Top 40 Albums</a> in New Zealand. The record sold seven million copies in its first three months on sale.

Three additional commercial singles were released in 1992. "One", released in March at the beginning of the Zoo TV Tour, reached number seven in the UK and number ten in the US charts. Like its predecessor, it topped the Modern Rock Tracks chart, and the singles charts in Canada and Ireland. The song has since become regarded as one of the greatest of all time, ranking highly on many critics' lists. The fourth single from "Achtung Baby", "Even Better Than the Real Thing", was released in June. The album version of the song peaked at number 12 on the UK Singles Chart, while reaching number one on the US Album Rock Tracks chart. A "<a href="Perfecto%20Mix">Perfecto</a>" remix of the song by <a href="DJ">DJ</a> <a href="Paul%20Oakenfold">Paul Oakenfold</a> performed better in the UK than the album version did, peaking at number eight. "Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses" followed in August 1992 as the fifth and final single. It peaked at number 14 on the UK Singles Chart, and number two on the US Album Rock Tracks chart. All five commercial singles charted within the top 20 in Ireland, Australia, Canada, and UK. <a href="Promotional%20recording">Promotional singles</a> for "Until the End of the World", "Salomé", and "Zoo Station" were also released. By the end of 1992, "Achtung Baby" had sold 10 million copies worldwide.

In October 1992, U2 released "Achtung Baby: The Videos, the Cameos, and a Whole Lot of Interference from Zoo TV", a <a href="VHS">VHS</a> and <a href="LaserDisc">LaserDisc</a> compilation of nine <a href="music%20video">music video</a>s from the album. Running for 65 minutes, it was produced by Ned O'Hanlon and released by Island and <a href="PolyGram">PolyGram</a>. It included three music videos each for "One" and "Even Better than the Real Thing", along with videos for "The Fly", "Mysterious Ways", and "Until the End of the World". Interspersed between the music videos were clips of so-called "interference", comprising documentary footage, media clips, and other video similar to what was displayed at Zoo TV Tour concerts. The release was certified platinum in the US, and gold in Canada.

"Achtung Baby" received acclaim from critics. Elysa Gardner of "Rolling Stone" said U2 had "proven that the same penchant for epic musical and verbal gestures that leads many artists to self-parody can, in more inspired hands, fuel the unforgettable fire that defines great rock & roll." The review said that the album, like its predecessor "Rattle and Hum", was an attempt by the band to "broaden its musical palette, but this time its ambitions are realized". Bill Wyman from "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" called it a "pristinely produced and surprisingly unpretentious return by one of the most impressive bands in the world". Steve Morse of "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" echoed these sentiments, stating that the album "not only reinvigorates their sound, but drops any self-righteousness. The songs focus on personal relationships, not on saving the world." Morse commended the album's "clanging, knob-twisting sound effects" and the Edge's "metallic, head-snapping guitar". In the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>", <a href="Robert%20Hilburn">Robert Hilburn</a> stated, "the arty, guitar-driven textures are among the band's most confident and vigorous ever". He said the album is a difficult one for listeners because of the dark, introspective nature of the songs, which contrasts with the group's uplifting songs of the past. Parry Gettelmen of the "<a href="Orlando%20Sentinel">Orlando Sentinel</a>" said that "Achtung Baby" "shows U2 still has the power to surprise", highlighting the warmth of Bono's vocals, the imagery of his lyrics, and the producers for helping the Edge "achieve a spacious sound without getting anthemic". He commended the band's musical transformation, saying, "U2 proves much more adept at the dance-trance thing than the Happy Roses or Stone Carpets or other indistinguishable haircut bands". <a href="Jon%20Pareles">Jon Pareles</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" lauded the record not only for featuring "noisy, vertiginous arrangements", but also for the group's ability to "maintain its pop skills". The review concluded, "Stripped-down and defying its old formulas, U2 has given itself a fighting chance for the 1990s."

"<a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">Q</a>"s <a href="Mat%20Snow">Mat Snow</a> called "Achtung Baby" U2's "heaviest album to date. And best." Snow praised the band and its production team for making "music of drama, depth, intensity and, believe it, funkiness". <a href="Greg%20Kot">Greg Kot</a> of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" felt the record "shows the band in a grittier light: disrupting, rather than fulfilling, expectations". He praised Lanois' production and said that due to the Edge's guitar playing, "U2 sounds punkier than it has since its 1980 debut, "Boy"". Kot concluded his review by calling the album "a magnificent search for transcendence made all the more moving for its flaws". <a href="Niall%20Stokes">Niall Stokes</a> of "<a href="Hot%20Press">Hot Press</a>" wrote, "Ostensibly decadent, sensual and dark, it is a record of, and for, these times." "<a href="The%20New%20Zealand%20Herald">The New Zealand Herald</a>" found it "pretty damn good" and its sound "subdued, tightly controlled, [and] introverted". However, it said that too many "downbeat moments where songs seem to be going nowhere" prevented it from being a "truly wondrous affair". In "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>", <a href="James%20Greer%20%28writer%29">Jim Greer</a> was more critical of the album, calling it an "ambitious failure"; the review welcomed its experimentation but judged that when the group "strays from familiar territory, the results are hit-and-miss". "<a href="Village%20Voice">Village Voice</a>" critic <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> rated it a dud, and in 1994, he reflected on this sentiment: "After many, many tries, "Achtung Baby" still sounded like a damnably diffuse U2 album to me, and I put it in the hall unable to describe a single song." In a retrospective review for <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>, <a href="Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine</a> praised the band's musical transformation as "thorough", "effective", and "endlessly inventive". Erlewine concluded that few artists at that stage in their career could have "recorded an album as adventurous or fulfilled their ambitions quite as successfully as U2 [did]".

The success of "Achtung Baby" and the Zoo TV Tour re-established U2 as one of the most popular and critically acclaimed musical acts in the world. The group nearly swept "Rolling Stone"s 1992 end-of-year readers' polls, winning honours for "Best Single" ("One"), "Artist of the Year", "Best Album", "Best Songwriter" (Bono), "Best Album Cover", and "Comeback of the Year", among others. Critics at several newspapers, such as "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>", "The Boston Globe", and the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>", ranked the album among the year's best. The album placed fourth on the "Best Albums" list from "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>"s 1991 <a href="Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop</a> critics' poll. At the <a href="35th%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">35th Annual Grammy Awards</a>, "Achtung Baby" won the award for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Rock%20Performance%20by%20a%20Duo%20or%20Group%20with%20Vocal">Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal</a>, and it earned Lanois and Eno the award for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Producer%20of%20the%20Year%2C%20Non-Classical">Producer of the Year (Non-Classical)</a>. The record was also nominated for the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Album%20of%20the%20Year">Grammy Award for Album of the Year</a>, and was shortlisted for the 1992 <a href="Mercury%20Prize%23Winners%20and%20shortlisted%20nominees">Mercury Music Prize</a>.

Following the release of "Achtung Baby", U2 staged a worldwide <a href="concert%20tour">concert tour</a>, titled the Zoo TV Tour. Like "Achtung Baby", the tour was intended to deviate from the band's past. In contrast to the austere stage setups of previous U2 tours, Zoo TV was an elaborately staged multimedia event. It satirised television and the viewing public's over-stimulation by attempting to instill "<a href="sensory%20overload">sensory overload</a>" in its audience. The stage featured large video screens that showed visual effects, random video clips from <a href="popular%20culture">pop culture</a>, and flashing text phrases. Live satellite link-ups, <a href="channel%20surfing">channel surfing</a>, <a href="crank%20call">crank call</a>s, and video <a href="confessional">confessional</a>s were incorporated into the shows.

Whereas the group were known for their earnest live act in the 1980s, their Zoo TV performances were intentionally ironic and self-deprecating; on stage, Bono portrayed several characters he conceived, including "The Fly", "Mirror Ball Man", and "MacPhisto". The majority of the album's songs were played at each show, and the <a href="set%20list">set list</a>s began with up to eight consecutive "Achtung Baby" songs as a further sign that they were no longer the U2 of the 1980s.

The tour began in February 1992 and comprised 157 shows over almost two years. During a six-month break, the band recorded the album "<a href="Zooropa">Zooropa</a>", which was released in July 1993. It was inspired by Zoo TV and expanded on its themes of technology and media oversaturation. By the time the tour concluded in December 1993, U2 had played to approximately 5.3 million fans. In 2002, "Q" magazine said the Zoo TV Tour was "still the most spectacular rock tour staged by any band". The tour's 27 November 1993 concert in Sydney was filmed and commercially released as "" by PolyGram in May 1994.

"Achtung Baby" is certified 8× platinum in the US by the RIAA, and according to <a href="Nielsen%20Soundscan">Nielsen Soundscan</a>, the album had sold 5.5 million copies in the country by March 2009. The record has been certified 5× platinum in Australia, 4× platinum in the UK, and diamond in Canada, the highest certification award. Overall, 18 million copies have been sold worldwide. It is U2's second-highest-selling record after "The Joshua Tree", which has sold 25 million copies. For the band, "Achtung Baby" was a watershed that secured their creative future, and its success led to the group's continued musical experimentation during the 1990s. "Zooropa", released in 1993, was a further departure for the band, incorporating additional dance music influences and electronic effects into their sound. In 1995, U2 and Brian Eno collaborated on the <a href="experimental%20music">experimental</a>/<a href="ambient%20music">ambient</a> album "<a href="Original%20Soundtracks%201">Original Soundtracks 1</a>" under the pseudonym "Passengers". For "<a href="Pop%20%28U2%20album%29">Pop</a>" in 1997, the group's experiences with <a href="dance%20club">dance club</a> culture and their usage of <a href="tape%20loop">tape loop</a>s, <a href="programming%20%28music%29">programming</a>, rhythm <a href="Music%20sequencer">sequencing</a>, and <a href="Sampling%20%28music%29">sampling</a> resulted in their most dance-oriented album.

The record is highly regarded among the members of U2. Mullen said: "I thought it was a great record. I was very proud of it. Its success was by no means preordained. It was a real break from what we had done before and we didn't know if our fans would like it or not." Bono called the album a "pivot point" in the band's career, saying, "Making "Achtung Baby" is the reason we're still here now." Clayton concurred, saying: "If we hadn't done something we were excited about, that made us apprehensive and challenged everything we stood for, then there would really have been no reason to carry on... If it hadn't been a great record by our standards, the existence of the band would have been threatened." The group's reinvention occurred at the peak of the alternative rock movement, when the genre was achieving widespread mainstream popularity. Bill Flanagan pointed out that many of U2's 1980s contemporaries struggled commercially with albums released after the turn of the decade. He argued that U2, however, were able to take advantage of the alternative rock movement and ensure a successful future by "set[ting] themselves up as the first of the new groups rather than the last of the old". <a href="Toby%20Creswell">Toby Creswell</a> echoed these sentiments in his 2006 music reference book "<a href="1001%20Songs">1001 Songs</a>", writing that the album helped U2 avoid "becoming parodies of themselves and being swept aside by the <a href="grunge">grunge</a> and techno revolutions". <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> called the album "a pivotal moment for <a href="dance-rock">dance-rock</a>, happening late in the game but showing that even the biggest young band in the world had an eye on the dancefloor", while "<a href="Uncut%20%28magazine%29">Uncut</a>" wrote that U2 "blithely ignored both grunge and <a href="Britpop">Britpop</a> and reinvented themselves with the post-modern dance-rock of "Achtung Baby"". A 2010 retrospective by "Spin" said that "U2 became the emblematic band of the alternative-rock era with "Achtung Baby"."

"Achtung Baby" has been acclaimed by writers and music critics as one of the greatest albums of all time; according to <a href="Acclaimed%20Music">Acclaimed Music</a>, it is the 80th-highest-ranked record on critics' lists. In 1997, "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" collated worldwide data from a range of renowned critics, artists, and radio DJs, who placed the record at number 71 on a list of the "100 Best Albums Ever". In 2003, the <a href="Music%20Business%20Association">National Association of Recording Merchandisers</a> ranked it at number 45 on its "Definitive 200" list, while "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" featured it on their list of the top 40 albums of all time. Three years later, the album appeared on a number of all-time lists, including "Hot Press"s "100 Greatest Albums Ever" at number 21, "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>"s list of "The All-Time 100 Albums", and the book "<a href="1001%20Albums%20You%20Must%20Hear%20Before%20You%20Die">1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die</a>". VH1 ranked it 65th on the "100 Greatest Albums of Rock & Roll" episode of its series "<a href="The%20Greatest%20%28TV%20series%29">The Greatest</a>". "Rolling Stone" placed the record at number 63 on its 2012 list of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone%27s%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time</a>", calling it "a prescient mix of sleek rock and pulsing Euro grooves" while saying "the emotional turmoil made U2 sound more human than ever". "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>"s 2013 list of the "All-Time Greatest" albums ranked the record 23rd, saying that instead of "coast[ing] forever on the cinematic storytelling they mastered on the excellently righteous "The Joshua Tree"", the group "ripped up the rule book" with "Achtung Baby". The record topped "Spin"s list of the 125 most influential albums from 1985 to 2010; writer Charles Aaron said: "Unlike <a href="Radiohead">Radiohead</a> with "<a href="OK%20Computer">OK Computer</a>" and "<a href="Kid%20A">Kid A</a>", U2 took their post-industrial, trad-rock disillusionment not as a symbol of overall cultural malaise, but as a challenge to buck up and transcend... Struggling to simultaneously embrace and blow up the world, they were never more inspirational."

The 20th anniversary of "Achtung Baby" was marked by several releases in 2011. At the band's request, a <a href="documentary%20film">documentary film</a> about the album entitled "<a href="From%20the%20Sky%20Down">From the Sky Down</a>" was produced. It was directed by <a href="Davis%20Guggenheim">Davis Guggenheim</a>, who previously collaborated with the Edge for the documentary "<a href="It%20Might%20Get%20Loud">It Might Get Loud</a>" in 2008. "From the Sky Down" documents the album's difficult recording period, the band members' relationships, and U2's creative process. Archival footage and stills from the recording sessions appear in the film, along with unreleased scenes from "Rattle and Hum". For the documentary, the band were filmed during a return visit to Hansa Studios and during rehearsals for the <a href="Glastonbury%20Festival%202011">Glastonbury Festival 2011</a>. The film premiered at the <a href="2011%20Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival">2011 Toronto International Film Festival</a>, becoming the first documentary to open the festival, and in October, it was broadcast on multiple television networks worldwide.

On 31 October 2011, "Achtung Baby" was <a href="reissue">reissue</a>d in five formats. In addition to a single-disc release of the album, a deluxe edition included a bonus disc of remixes and <a href="B-side">B-side</a>s from the album's five singles, and a vinyl edition included the album on two <a href="LP%20record">LPs</a> with two additional LPs of remixes. The 10-disc "Super Deluxe" and "Über Deluxe" editions included: the "Zooropa" album; three additional CDs with remixes, B-sides, and outtakes; a "kindergarten" disc with nascent versions of "Achtung Baby"s 12 songs; four DVDs containing "From the Sky Down", the "Zoo TV: Live from Sydney" concert film, music videos, and other bonus material; 16 art prints; and a hardback book. The "Über Deluxe" edition also contains a double-vinyl copy of the album, five 7-inch vinyl singles, a copy of U2's fan club magazine "Propaganda", and a replica of Bono's "Fly" sunglasses. The media initially reported that the reissue was a <a href="remaster">remaster</a>ed release. However, the reissue's official website initially excluded any mention of "remastering" before adding it and then removing it. The Edge confirmed that the album was not fully remastered since "the original was so right" and so much "artistry had gone into the original <a href="Equalization%20%28audio%29">EQ'ing</a>" but did say said that they were able to "optimize it... tweak the levels, give it a bit of a polish". "Blow Your House Down", an outtake included in the deluxe editions, was released as a promotional single in October 2011.

"Q" commissioned an "Achtung Baby" <a href="tribute%20album">tribute album</a>, entitled "<a href="AHK-toong%20BAY-bi%20Covered">AHK-toong BAY-bi Covered</a>", that was included in the magazine's December 2011 issue.

Continuing a campaign by U2 to reissue all of their records on vinyl, "Achtung Baby" was re-released on two 180-gram vinyl records on 27 July 2018. Unlike the 2011 reissue, the album was remastered for its 2018 reissue, with direction from the Edge. Each copy includes a download card that can be used to redeem a digital copy of the album.

Kill 'Em All

Kill 'Em All is the debut studio album by the American <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a> band <a href="Metallica">Metallica</a>, released on July 25, 1983, by the independent record label <a href="Megaforce%20Records">Megaforce Records</a>. "Kill 'Em All" is regarded as a groundbreaking album for <a href="thrash%20metal">thrash metal</a> because of its precise musicianship, which fuses <a href="new%20wave%20of%20British%20heavy%20metal">new wave of British heavy metal</a> riffs with <a href="hardcore%20punk">hardcore punk</a> <a href="tempo">tempo</a>s. The album's musical approach and lyrics were markedly different from rock's mainstream of the early 1980s and inspired a number of bands who followed in similar manner. The album did not enter the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> until 1986, when it peaked at number 155, following Metallica's commercial success with its third studio album "<a href="Master%20of%20Puppets">Master of Puppets</a>"; the 1988 <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra</a> reissue peaked at number 120. "Kill 'Em All" was critically praised at the time of its release and in retrospect, and was placed on a few publications' best album lists. It was certified <a href="RIAA%20certification">3× Platinum</a> by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA) in 1999 for shipping three million copies in the United States. The album generated two singles, "<a href="Whiplash%20%28Metallica%20song%29">Whiplash</a>" and "<a href="Jump%20in%20the%20Fire">Jump in the Fire</a>".

Metallica began by playing shows in local clubs in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. They recorded several <a href="demo%20%28music%29">demos</a> to gain attention from club owners, and eventually relocated to <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> to secure the services of bassist <a href="Cliff%20Burton">Cliff Burton</a>. The group's "<a href="No%20Life%20%27til%20Leather">No Life 'til Leather</a>" demo tape (1982) was noticed by Megaforce label head <a href="Jon%20Zazula">Jon Zazula</a>, who signed them and provided a budget of $15,000 for recording. The album was recorded in May with producer Paul Curcio at the Music America Studios in <a href="Rochester%2C%20New%20York">Rochester, New York</a>. It was originally intended to be titled "Metal Up Your Ass", with cover art featuring a hand clutching a dagger emerging from a toilet bowl. The band was asked to change the name because distributors feared that releasing an album with such an offensive title and artwork would diminish its chances of commercial success. Metallica promoted the album on the two-month co-headlining <a href="Kill%20%27Em%20All%20for%20One">Kill 'Em All for One</a> tour with English heavy metal band <a href="Raven%20%28British%20band%29">Raven</a> in the U.S. Although the initial shipment was 15,000 copies in the U.S., the album sold 60,000 copies worldwide by the end of Metallica's Seven Dates of Hell European tour in 1984.

Metallica was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles by drummer <a href="Lars%20Ulrich">Lars Ulrich</a> and by vocalist and guitarist <a href="James%20Hetfield">James Hetfield</a>. Before settling on a definitive lineup, <a href="Metal%20Blade%20Records">Metal Blade Records</a> owner <a href="Brian%20Slagel">Brian Slagel</a> asked Metallica to record a song for the first edition of his "<a href="Metal%20Massacre">Metal Massacre</a>" compilation. Hetfield and Ulrich chose "Hit the Lights" from Hetfield's previous band <a href="Leather%20Charm">Leather Charm</a>, and recorded it with Hetfield on vocals, his childhood friend <a href="Ron%20McGovney">Ron McGovney</a> on bass, and temporary guitarist Lloyd Grant. The band's first lineup featured Hetfield, Ulrich, McGovney, and guitarist <a href="Dave%20Mustaine">Dave Mustaine</a>, who was acquired through a newspaper advertisement. The band practiced in McGovney's garage and looked for gigs at local clubs. Metallica's first show was on March 14, 1982, at the Radio City in <a href="Anaheim%2C%20California">Anaheim</a>. The nine-song setlist consisted of two originals ("Hit the Lights" and an unfinished version of "<a href="Jump%20in%20the%20Fire">Jump in the Fire</a>" from Mustaine's earlier band Panic) and covers of <a href="new%20wave%20of%20British%20heavy%20metal">new wave of British heavy metal</a> (NWOBHM) bands such as <a href="Diamond%20Head%20%28band%29">Diamond Head</a>, <a href="Blitzkrieg%20%28band%29">Blitzkrieg</a>, <a href="Savage%20%28band%29">Savage</a>, and <a href="Sweet%20Savage">Sweet Savage</a>. The gig turned out to be notorious, because Mustaine had problems with the guitar <a href="distortion%20%28music%29">distortion pedal</a>, and broke a string during a song. Metallica's second gig was on March 27, 1982 at <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>'s <a href="Whisky%20a%20Go%20Go">Whisky a Go Go</a>, opening for <a href="Saxon%20%28band%29">Saxon</a>. Although <a href="M%C3%B6tley%20Cr%C3%BCe">Mötley Crüe</a> was originally scheduled to open the show, the group canceled because of its growing popularity. Metallica recorded a three-song demo to persuade the venue's management to allow the band to open for Saxon. Metallica's third concert was in April 1982, at which was premiered "The Mechanix", written by Mustaine during his tenure with Panic. Mustaine interacted with the fans at Metallica's earliest shows because Hetfield was shy.

To draw attention from club owners, Metallica recorded the "Power Metal" demo in April 1982 which featured "Motorbreath" in addition to the already-performed originals. The logo, displaying the band's name with the first and last letter drawn larger with sharp <a href="serif">serif</a>s and italicized, was designed by Hetfield. The "<a href="No%20Life%20%27til%20Leather">No Life 'til Leather</a>" demo was recorded in July 1982, and it created a buzz in the underground <a href="tape%20trading">tape trading</a> circles. "No Life 'til Leather" featured a re-recorded version of "Hit the Lights", which appeared on the second pressing of "Metal Massacre", in addition to new songs such as "Phantom Lord", "Seek & Destroy", and "Metal Militia". The recording and <a href="audio%20mastering">mastering</a> was financed by Kenny Kane, owner of the punk label High Velocity, and distributed by Ulrich and his friend Pat Scott. Because of tensions with Mustaine, McGovney left the band in December. Ulrich was impressed by <a href="Cliff%20Burton">Cliff Burton</a>'s performance with <a href="Trauma%20%28band%29">Trauma</a> at <a href="The%20Troubadour%2C%20West%20Hollywood">The Troubadour</a> in West Hollywood, and offered to let him join the group. Burton joined on the condition that Metallica would relocate to the San Francisco area. Moving to <a href="El%20Cerrito%2C%20California">El Cerrito</a> in February 1983, the band stayed and rehearsed at <a href="Exodus%20%28American%20band%29">Exodus</a> manager <a href="Mark%20Whitaker%20%28record%20producer%29">Mark Whitaker</a>'s house, which they called the "Metallica Mansion". Metallica intended to record its debut in Los Angeles on Slagel's independent label on an $8,000 budget. Slagel could not afford the record, and Ulrich contacted <a href="Jon%20Zazula">Jon Zazula</a>, a New Jersey record store owner and promoter of heavy metal bands on the East Coast who had already heard "No Life 'til Leather". Metallica rented a <a href="U-Haul">U-Haul</a> truck and drove to New Jersey in late March, and upon arrival, allowed Zazula to sell copies of "No Life 'til Leather" to help him found <a href="Megaforce%20Records">Megaforce Records</a>, because no label wanted to finance the album's recording.

Hetfield and Ulrich fired Mustaine on the morning of April 11 after a gig in New York, because of his drug and alcohol problems, overly aggressive behavior, and clashes with bandmates. On Whitaker's recommendation, Metallica recruited <a href="Kirk%20Hammett">Kirk Hammett</a>, who played in Exodus and was a one-time student of <a href="Joe%20Satriani">Joe Satriani</a>. Hammett learned the songs on his flight to New York, and started recording the album with Metallica barely a month later. Metallica met producer Paul Curcio at Music America studios in <a href="Rochester%2C%20New%20York">Rochester</a>, and recorded the album in two weeks. Unable to afford a hotel during the recording sessions, the band members lived in people's houses in Rochester and at the Music Factory in <a href="Jamaica%2C%20Queens">Jamaica, Queens</a>, where <a href="Anthrax%20%28American%20band%29">Anthrax</a> held rehearsals. Curcio had set the studio equipment as if he were recording an ordinary rock band. He thought the initial tapes sounded very distorted, and tried to compensate by turning down the knobs. Metallica resented Curcio's involvement, because he seemed uninterested, and had little impact on the sound. Although Zazula wanted Hammett to replicate Mustaine's solos, Hammett's guitar solos on the album were partially based on Mustaine's original solos, with the first four bars of most solos written by Mustaine before his departure. Despite their differences, Mustaine's contributions to the early years of Metallica were still acknowledged, and he received four co-writing credits on "Kill 'Em All". Zazula was not satisfied with the initial <a href="audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mix</a> because he thought the drums were too loud, and the guitars were too low in the mix. The remix was done by sound engineer Chris Bubacz, according to Zazula's instructions. The final cost for the record rounded to an estimated $15,000, which nearly caused Zazula to go bankrupt. "This was mortgage money I'm spending, not something I've got put by I'm going to invest," he said later. Zazula had a hard time finding a distributor for the record, but he eventually convinced <a href="Relativity%20Records">Relativity Records</a> to distribute the album in the U.S. and Canada, and <a href="Music%20for%20Nations">Music for Nations</a> in Europe.
The band initially intended to title the album "Metal Up Your Ass" with the cover featuring a hand clutching a dagger emerging from a toilet bowl. However, Zazula convinced them to change this as he thought distributors would not stock it as it was too explicit to display. The final cover featured the shadow of a hand letting go of a bloodied hammer. Burton was credited with coming up with the name "Kill 'Em All"—referring to timid record distributors, saying, "Those record company fuckers ... kill 'em all!"—as a response to the situation. Ulrich thought "Kill 'Em All" was a good name, and Zazula agreed. Burton suggested to Gary L. Heard, also responsible for the Metallica photograph on the back cover, to feature a bloodied hammer on the album art. According to Hammett, "Cliff carried a hammer with him everywhere he went. He always had a hammer in his luggage, and he would take it out occasionally and start destroying things." Even though the original title was unused, the band did later release a "Metal Up Your Ass" T-shirt with the proposed artwork. A live <a href="bootleg%20recording">bootleg recording</a> of a 1982 performance at the <a href="Old%20Waldorf">Old Waldorf</a>, titled "Metal Up Your Ass (Live)", featured the original cover artwork. Original pressings of the album came with an inner <a href="record%20sleeve">sleeve</a> that included pictures and lyrics as well as a silver label on the vinyl. Subsequent pressings had a blank white sleeve and standard album label. The 1988 reissue re-introduced the lyrics and photos. The original release can be distinguished by the words "Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang" at the top of the back cover. This was dropped from the reissue. The phrase "Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang" was dedicated to San Francisco fan Ray Burch, known for his <a href="headbanging">headbanging</a> at the band's early shows.

"Kill 'Em All" features intricate riffing reminiscent of the NWOBHM bands played at high velocity. The album is considered crucial in the <a href="thrash%20metal">thrash metal</a> genesis because it introduced fast percussion, low-register chords, and <a href="shred%20guitar">shredding</a> leads to the genre. Hammett played some <a href="pentatonic%20scale">pentatonic</a> patterns in addition to his breakneck solos. Ulrich adopted a <a href="double%20time">double time</a> snare pattern that would become a mainstay on Metallica's subsequent albums. Hetfield's vocals evolved from the melodic wail on "No Life 'til Leather" to a rough-edged bark, and the entire band played faster and more accurately on "Kill 'Em All". Music writer <a href="Joel%20McIver">Joel McIver</a> said Burton's and Hetfield's performances were nearly virtuosic, because of the smooth-sounding bass of the former and the precise picking skills of the latter. According to journalist <a href="Chuck%20Eddy">Chuck Eddy</a>, the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare, violence and life on the road gives the album a "naive charm". The musical approach on "Kill 'Em All" was in contrast to the <a href="glam%20metal">glam metal</a> bands who dominated the charts in the early 1980s. Because of its rebellious nature and Metallica's street appearance, it appealed to fans who were not into the mainstream of hard rock.

"Hit the Lights" was based on an unfinished Leather Charm song written by Hetfield and Hugh Tanner. Hetfield had brought the majority of the song to Ulrich, and the two worked out different arrangements. Performed at 160 <a href="beats%20per%20minute">beats per minute</a>, "Hit the Lights" opens with fade-in distorted guitars and a short shriek by Hetfield. The song is driven by the <a href="16th%20note">16th note</a> repeated main riff and the continuous <a href="eighth%20note">eighth note</a> snare drum hits. The lyrics celebrate heavy metal itself and are sung with short and high pitched vocals. The song ends with several lengthy guitar solos by Hammett, who performed cleaner and more melodic versions of Mustaine's leads. "The Four Horsemen" is a revamp of the Mustaine-penned "The Mechanix", which originally had lyrics about having sex at a gas station. A modified version of his composition with the original lyrics appeared on <a href="Megadeth">Megadeth</a>'s debut "<a href="Killing%20Is%20My%20Business...%20and%20Business%20Is%20Good%21">Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!</a>" (1985). Although Mustaine told Metallica not to use any of his music, Hetfield wrote lyrics about the <a href="Four%20Horsemen%20of%20the%20Apocalypse">Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse</a> and added a <a href="bridge%20%28music%29">bridge</a> and cleanly picked guitar solo in the middle. Mustaine said the bridge was inspired by the main riff in <a href="Lynyrd%20Skynyrd">Lynyrd Skynyrd</a>'s "<a href="Sweet%20Home%20Alabama">Sweet Home Alabama</a>".
"Motorbreath" was written by Hetfield during his time in Leather Charm and tells about life on the road. The song is based on a four-chord verse and a stop-and-start chorus. The most recognizable parts are Ulrich's <a href="drum%20roll">drum roll</a>s in each chorus and the riff that accompanies Hammett's solos. Because of its speed, the song requires fast picking by the bassist. "Jump in the Fire" was originally written by Mustaine, with lyrics about teenage sexual experience. Hetfield's revised lyrics for the album were written from <a href="Satan">Satan</a>'s point of view, describing how the devil watches people killing each other, and is sure they will go to <a href="hell">hell</a> for their actions. "Jump in the Fire" was released as a single in the UK in February 1984 to promote a UK tour with <a href="Venom%20%28band%29">Venom</a>. The single featured "Phantom Lord" and "Seek & Destroy" as live tracks, although they are actually studio recordings with fake crowd noise dubbed over them. The single's cover art features an oil painting titled "The Devils of D-Day", created by artist <a href="Les%20Edwards">Les Edwards</a> in 1978.
"(Anesthesia)—Pulling Teeth" is a bass solo by Burton, accompanied on drums by Ulrich. A staple of Burton's live performances since his high school days in the band Agents of Misfortune, the instrumental track featured Burton's distinctive "lead-bass" style of playing, incorporating heavy distortion, use of <a href="wah-wah%20pedal">wah-wah pedal</a> and <a href="tapping">tapping</a>. Bubacz introduces the track as "Bass solo, take one", informing listeners that the song was recorded in one take. "(Anesthesia)—Pulling Teeth" was the bass solo that Burton was playing when Hetfield and Ulrich first saw him at a gig. Hetfield stated: "We heard this wild solo going on and thought, 'I don't see any guitar player up there.' We were both counting the strings and I finally turned to Lars and said, 'Dude, that's a bass!' Cliff was up there on stage with his band Trauma with a wah-wah pedal and his huge mop of red hair. He didn't care whether people were there. He was looking down at his bass, playing." "<a href="Whiplash%20%28Metallica%20song%29">Whiplash</a>" was the album's first single, issued on August 8, 1983. It features a swift rhythm line of straight 16th notes played at about 200 beats per minute. Hetfield and Burton performed with <a href="palm%20mute">palm mute</a>d technique and precise metronomic control. The lyrics celebrate crowd energy and headbanging. Rock journalist <a href="Mick%20Wall">Mick Wall</a> wrote that "Whiplash" signified the birth of thrash metal, stating: "If one wishes to identify the very moment thrash metal arrived spitting and snarling into the world, 'Whiplash' is indisputably it."

"Phantom Lord" is a lyrical nod to devilry. The song begins with synthesized bass drone and contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords. Written by Mustaine, its central riff is in NWOBHM fashion. "No Remorse" is a mid-tempo song which suddenly accelerates its tempo in the fifth minute. The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle. "<a href="Seek%20%26amp%3B%20Destroy">Seek & Destroy</a>" was inspired by Diamond Head's "Dead Reckoning" and is the first song Metallica recorded during the "Kill 'Em All" sessions. Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working. Because of its simple, one-line chorus, the song became a permanent setlist fixture and a crowd singalong. "Metal Militia", one of the fastest songs on the album, is about heavy metal's way of life and <a href="nonconformity%20%28quality%29">nonconformity</a>. Mustaine composed the main riff, which emulates a marching army. The song ends with tramping feet and bullet ricochet in a fade-out.

"Kill 'Em All" received critical acclaim. Bernard Doe of "<a href="Metal%20Forces">Metal Forces</a>" described "Kill 'Em All" as one of the fastest and heaviest albums ever recorded, and remarked that the album is not for the faint-hearted. <a href="Greg%20Kot">Greg Kot</a> of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" acknowledged it as the "<a href="speed%20metal">speed metal</a> prototype", but felt the lyrical replication of <a href="Judas%20Priest">Judas Priest</a> and the <a href="Misfits%20%28band%29">Misfits</a> kept the album short from becoming a classic. In a retrospective review, "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" praised "Kill 'Em All" for changing the face of popular music with its unique combination of punk and metal. <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>'s Steve Huey called it "the true birth of thrash". He praised Hetfield's highly technical rhythm guitar style and said that the band was "playing with tightly controlled fury even at the most ridiculously fast tempos". Rob Kemp, writing in "<a href="The%20Rolling%20Stone%20Album%20Guide">The Rolling Stone Album Guide</a>", credited the album for consolidating the punk rock and heavy metal scenes, but felt that apart from "Seek & Destroy" and "(Anesthesia)—Pulling Teeth", most of the album had the band "trying to look tough" over enthusiastic but unfinished riff-based songs. Journalist <a href="Martin%20Popoff">Martin Popoff</a> said "Kill 'Em All" differentiated from the debuts by Metallica's <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay%20Area">Bay Area</a> contemporaries because the fans could identify with Hetfield's lyrics and the band's appearance. "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>"s Chuck Eddy considered "Kill 'Em All" the inception of the "<a href="extreme%20metal">extreme metal</a> mania" of the early 1980s. He noted the album did not receive much critical praise at the time of its release, but said it aged well and opened the doors for the less commercially successful bands. Although McIver credits Venom's "<a href="Welcome%20to%20Hell">Welcome to Hell</a>" (1981) as the first thrash metal album, he acknowledged "Kill 'Em All" as a major influence on the flourishing American heavy metal scene. Despite its "less-than-perfect" production, "<a href="Loudwire">Loudwire</a>"s Jon Wiederhorn said that "Kill 'Em All" sounds like an "influential slice of history" and stands on the same level as classic albums by <a href="Black%20Sabbath">Black Sabbath</a>, <a href="Iron%20Maiden">Iron Maiden</a>, and Judas Priest.
"Kill 'Em All" was released on July 25, 1983 by Megaforce with an initial pressing of 15,000 copies. Because of the label's financial restrictions, the album was pressed in batches of 500 copies. "Kill 'Em All" had sold 17,000 copies in the U.S. by the end of the year. Similarly to punk rock acts, Metallica promoted its material through the tape trading network and independent music magazines such as "Metal Forces" in the UK and "Metal Mania" in the U.S. The album did not enter the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> chart until 1986, when it peaked at number 155 following Metallica's commercial success with its third studio album "<a href="Master%20of%20Puppets">Master of Puppets</a>". The 1988 re-issue on <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra Records</a> also charted on the "Billboard" 200, peaking at number 120. It was certified <a href="RIAA%20certification">3× Platinum</a> by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA) in 1999 for shipping three million copies in the United States. Despite being the lowest selling Metallica studio album, it helped the band establish its image and build a fanbase in its inaugural years.
"Kill 'Em All", as the first thrash metal album released in the U.S., had substantial impact on the emerging scene and inspired numerous bands with its aggression and austere seriousness. Guitarist <a href="Kerry%20King">Kerry King</a> acknowledged <a href="Slayer">Slayer</a> was still finding its sound while Metallica had already determined its image and musical identity. Anthrax guitarist <a href="Scott%20Ian">Scott Ian</a> was impressed by the album's heaviness and songwriting, and said it influenced him as much as the albums by Iron Maiden. <a href="Dream%20Theater">Dream Theater</a>'s drummer <a href="Mike%20Portnoy">Mike Portnoy</a> observed that "Kill 'Em All" surpassed the NWOBHM bands in terms of sheer velocity and cited Burton's bass solo as the album's peak. Guitarist Ulf Cederlund of Swedish <a href="black%20metal">black metal</a> band <a href="Morbid%20%28band%29">Morbid</a> cited "Motorbreath" and "Metal Militia" as songs that influenced him as a young musician. "Kill 'Em All" was ranked at number 35 on "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>"'s list of The 100 Greatest Albums of the '80s. Additionally, the album placed at number 54 on "The 100 Best Debut Albums of All Time" and again at number 35 on "100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time", two lists compiled by the same magazine. "<a href="Kerrang%21">Kerrang!</a>" listed the album at number 29 among the "100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time". In 2010, <a href="Consequence%20of%20Sound">Consequence of Sound</a> ranked it number 94 among its "Top 100 Albums Ever".

In late July 1983, Metallica embarked on the two-month <a href="Kill%20%27Em%20All%20for%20One">Kill 'Em All for One</a> tour with British co-headliners <a href="Raven%20%28British%20band%29">Raven</a>. The tour name melded the titles of the albums the two bands were promoting: Metallica's "Kill 'Em All" and Raven's "<a href="All%20for%20One%20%28Raven%20album%29">All for One</a>", both released on Megaforce. The two groups met in Zazula's home two days before the tour began, and traveled in the same vehicle throughout the tour with five <a href="road%20crew">roadies</a> and sound engineer Whitaker. The tour was set to conclude with three shows in San Francisco, thus Hetfield painted "No Life 'til Frisco" on the Winnebago tour bus. The tour had a few poorly attended gigs, such as a performance at the Cheers club in <a href="Babylon%2C%20New%20York">Babylon, New York</a>, attended by some 50 people. After the conclusion of Kill 'Em All for One in early September, Metallica returned to El Cerrito to work on new material. Seven weeks after the tour ended, Metallica booked a number of performances at Bay Area clubs, the first a Halloween gig at the Keystone in <a href="Palo%20Alto%2C%20California">Palo Alto</a>. At the Country Club in <a href="Reseda%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Reseda</a>, the group debuted "Fight Fire with Fire" and "<a href="Creeping%20Death">Creeping Death</a>", along with an early version of "The Call of Ktulu", then titled "When Hell Freezes Over". Three days later, at a gig at The Stone in San Francisco, Metallica premiered "Ride the Lightning", the title track from the upcoming album. In December, Metallica went on a short tour in the Midwest and eastern United States with a three-man road crew: Whitaker, guitar technician <a href="John%20Marshall%20%28guitarist%29">John Marshall</a>, and drum technician Dave Marrs. The January 14, 1984 concert in Boston was canceled because the band's equipment was stolen the night before.
In February, Metallica embarked on its first European trek with <a href="Twisted%20Sister">Twisted Sister</a>, supporting Venom's Seven Dates of Hell tour. The tour was sponsored by Metallica's UK distributor, Music for Nations, who released the "Jump in the Fire" EP for that occasion. The first show was at the <a href="Volkshaus">Volkshaus</a> in Zurich on February 3. At the Aardschok Festival in <a href="Zwolle">Zwolle</a> on February 11, Metallica played in front of 7,000 people, its largest audience at the time. The tour stretched through countries such as <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="France">France</a>, and <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>, culminating in two sold-out shows at the <a href="Marquee%20Club">Marquee Club</a> in London. After concluding the Seven Dates Of Hell tour, Metallica headed to <a href="Sweet%20Silence%20Studios">Sweet Silence Studios</a> in Copenhagen to record its sophomore album "<a href="Ride%20the%20Lightning">Ride the Lightning</a>". By the end of the tour, "Kill 'Em All" had sold 60,000 copies worldwide and Metallica began to gain international recognition.
On June 8, 2013, at the <a href="Orion%20Festival">Orion Festival</a>, billed as the fictional band Dehaan, Metallica played the album in its entirety for the first time ever to mark the 30 year anniversary of the album.

All lyrics written by <a href="James%20Hetfield">James Hetfield</a>, except where noted. The bonus tracks on the 1988 re-release were originally recorded as B-sides for the "<a href="Creeping%20Death">Creeping Death</a>" single in 1984, later known as "Garage Days Revisited", and would later appear on the compilation album "<a href="Garage%20Inc.">Garage Inc.</a>" (1998).

New wave of British heavy metal

The new wave of British heavy metal (commonly abbreviated as NWOBHM) was a nationwide musical movement that started in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> in the late 1970s and achieved international attention by the early 1980s. Journalist <a href="Geoff%20Barton">Geoff Barton</a> coined the term in a May 1979 issue of the British music newspaper "<a href="Sounds%20%28magazine%29">Sounds</a>" to describe the emergence of new <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a> bands in the mid to late 1970s, during the period of <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a>'s decline and the dominance of <a href="new%20wave%20music">new wave music</a>.

Although encompassing diverse mainstream and underground styles, the music of the NWOBHM is best remembered for drawing on the heavy metal of the 1970s and infusing it with the intensity of punk rock to produce fast and aggressive songs. The <a href="DIY%20ethic">DIY</a> attitude of the new metal bands led to the spread of raw-sounding, self-produced recordings and a proliferation of <a href="independent%20record%20label">independent record label</a>s. Song lyrics were usually about escapist themes such as mythology, fantasy, horror and the rock lifestyle.

The NWOBHM began as an <a href="underground%20culture">underground</a> phenomenon growing in parallel to punk and largely ignored by the media. It was only through the promotion of rock DJ <a href="Neal%20Kay">Neal Kay</a> and "Sounds"' campaigning that it reached the public consciousness and gained radio airplay, recognition and success in the UK. The movement involved mostly young, white, male and working-class musicians and fans, who suffered the hardships brought on by rising unemployment for years after the <a href="1973%E2%80%9375%20recession">1973–75 recession</a>. As a reaction to their bleak reality, they created a community separate from mainstream society to enjoy each other's company and their favourite loud music. The NWOBHM was heavily criticised for the excessive hype generated by local media in favour of mostly talentless musicians. Nonetheless, it generated a renewal in the genre of heavy metal music and furthered the progress of the <a href="heavy%20metal%20subculture">heavy metal subculture</a>, whose updated behavioural and visual codes were quickly adopted by metal fans worldwide after the spread of the music to continental Europe, North America and Japan.

The movement spawned perhaps a thousand heavy metal bands, but only a few survived the advent of <a href="MTV">MTV</a> and the rise of the more commercial <a href="glam%20metal">glam metal</a> in the second half of the 1980s. Among them, <a href="Iron%20Maiden">Iron Maiden</a> and <a href="Def%20Leppard">Def Leppard</a> became international stars, and <a href="Mot%C3%B6rhead">Motörhead</a> and <a href="Saxon%20%28band%29">Saxon</a> had considerable success. Other groups, such as <a href="Diamond%20Head%20%28band%29">Diamond Head</a>, <a href="Venom%20%28band%29">Venom</a> and <a href="Raven%20%28British%20band%29">Raven</a>, remained underground, but were a major influence on the successful <a href="extreme%20metal">extreme metal</a> subgenres of the late 1980s and 1990s. Many bands from the NWOBHM reunited in the 2000s and remained active through live performances and new studio albums.

In the second half of the 1970s, the United Kingdom was in a state of social unrest and widespread poverty as a result of the ineffective social politics of both <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> and <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> governments during a three-year period of economic <a href="recession">recession</a>. As a consequence of <a href="Social%20history%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20%281945%E2%80%93present%29%23Deindustrialization">deindustrialization</a>, the unemployment rate was exceptionally high, especially among working class youth. It continued to rise in the early 1980s, peaking in February 1983. The discontent of so many people caused social unrest with frequent strikes, and culminated in a series of riots (see <a href="1981%20Brixton%20riot">1981 Brixton riot</a>, <a href="1981%20Toxteth%20riots">1981 Toxteth riots</a>). During this period, the mass of young people, deprived of the prospect of even relatively low-skill jobs that were available to the previous generations, searched for different ways to earn money in the music and entertainment businesses. The explosion of new bands and new musical styles coming from the UK in the late 1970s was a result of their efforts to make a living in the economic depression that hit the country before the governments of Prime Minister <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>.

The desperation and the violent reaction of a generation robbed of a safe future are well-represented by the British <a href="Punk%20subculture">punk</a> movement of 1977–1978, whose <a href="anti-establishment">rebellion against the establishment</a> continued diluted in the <a href="New%20wave%20music">new wave</a> and <a href="post-punk">post-punk</a> music of the 1980s. These self-proclaimed punks were politically militant, relishing their <a href="Anarchism%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom%23Contemporary%20times">anarchic attitude</a> and stage practices like <a href="Pogo%20%28dance%29">pogo dancing</a>. They wore short and spiked hairstyles or shaved heads, often with safety pins and ripped clothes, and considered musical prowess unimportant as long as the music was simple and loud. However, not all working-class male youths embraced the punk movement; some preferred to escape from their grim reality in <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a>, which was equally effective in providing fun, stress relief, and peer companionship – otherwise denied because of their unemployment.

The UK was a cradle of the first wave of heavy metal, which was born at the end of the 1960s and flowered in the early 1970s. Of the many British bands that came to prominence during that period, <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>, <a href="Black%20Sabbath">Black Sabbath</a> and <a href="Deep%20Purple">Deep Purple</a> achieved worldwide success and critical acclaim. The success of the music genre, usually called heavy rock at the time, generated a community of UK fans with strong ties to <a href="psychedelia">psychedelia</a>, <a href="hippie">hippie</a> doctrines and <a href="Rocker%20%28subculture%29">biker subculture</a>. Each of these bands was in crisis in the mid-to-late 1970s: Led Zeppelin were plagued by discord and personal tragedies and had drastically reduced their activities, Black Sabbath finally fired their charismatic but unreliable frontman <a href="Ozzy%20Osbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</a>, and Deep Purple disbanded. As a consequence, the whole movement lost much of its momentum and media interest, which were refocused on what British writer Malc Macmillan calls "the more fashionable or lucrative markets of the day" such as <a href="disco">disco</a>, <a href="glam%20rock">glam</a>, <a href="mod%20revival">mod revival</a>, new wave and <a href="electronic%20music">electronic music</a>. Just like <a href="progressive%20rock">progressive rock</a> acts and other mainstream music groups of the 1970s, heavy rock bands were viewed as – in the words of journalist <a href="Garry%20Bushell">Garry Bushell</a> – "lumbering dinosaurs" by a music press infatuated with <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> and new wave. Some writers even declared the premature demise of heavy metal altogether.

The crisis of British heavy rock giants left space for the rise of other rock bands in the mid-1970s, including <a href="Queen%20%28band%29">Queen</a>, <a href="Hawkwind">Hawkwind</a>, <a href="Budgie%20%28band%29">Budgie</a>, <a href="Bad%20Company">Bad Company</a>, <a href="Status%20Quo%20%28band%29">Status Quo</a> and <a href="Nazareth%20%28band%29">Nazareth</a>, all of which had multiple chart entries in the UK and had conducted successful international tours. The British chart results of the period show that there was still a vast audience for heavy metal in the country, and upcoming bands <a href="Thin%20Lizzy">Thin Lizzy</a>, <a href="UFO%20%28band%29">UFO</a> and <a href="Judas%20Priest">Judas Priest</a>, also had tangible success and media coverage in the late 1970s. Foreign <a href="hard%20rock">hard rock</a> acts, such as <a href="Blue%20%C3%96yster%20Cult">Blue Öyster Cult</a> and <a href="Kiss%20%28band%29">Kiss</a> from the US, <a href="Rush%20%28band%29">Rush</a> from Canada, <a href="Scorpions%20%28band%29">Scorpions</a> from Germany, and especially <a href="AC/DC">AC/DC</a> from Australia, climbed the British charts in the same period.

The band <a href="Mot%C3%B6rhead">Motörhead</a> was founded in 1975 by already experienced musicians. Their leader <a href="Lemmy">Ian "Lemmy" Kilmister</a> was a former member of the <a href="space%20rock">space rock</a> band Hawkwind, <a href="Larry%20Wallis">Larry Wallis</a> had played with <a href="Pink%20Fairies">Pink Fairies</a>, and <a href="Eddie%20Clarke%20%28musician%29">Eddie Clarke</a> had been a member of <a href="Curtis%20Knight">Curtis Knight</a>'s Zeus. Their previous experience is one element which divides critics and fans over whether the band belongs to the new wave of British heavy metal. Some believe that the band should be considered an inspiration for the movement, but not part of it, because they had signed recording contracts, toured the country, and had chart success before any NWOBHM band had stepped out of their local club scene. Motörhead were also the only metal band of the period recording songs with veteran <a href="BBC">BBC</a> radio DJ <a href="John%20Peel">John Peel</a> for his "Peel Sessions" program and the first to reach No. 1 in the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a> with the live album "<a href="No%20Sleep%20%27til%20Hammersmith">No Sleep 'til Hammersmith</a>" in June 1981. Lemmy himself said, "the NWOBHM ... didn't do us much good", because Motörhead "came along a bit too early for it".

Other critics view Motörhead as the first significant exponent of the movement and the first band to fully implement a crossover between punk rock and heavy metal. Their fast music, the renunciation of technical virtuosity in favour of sheer loudness, and their uncompromising attitude were welcomed equally by punks and heavy metal fans. Motörhead were supported by many NWOBHM bands on tour, and they also shared the stage with Lemmy's friends punk band <a href="The%20Damned%20%28band%29">The Damned</a>. Motörhead's musical style became very popular during the NWOBHM, making them a fundamental reference for the nascent movement and for musicians of various metal subgenres in the following decades.

The NWOBHM involved both musicians and fans who were largely young, male and white and shared class origin, ethic and aesthetic values. American sociologist <a href="Deena%20Weinstein">Deena Weinstein</a>, in her book "Heavy Metal: The Music and Its Culture", describes the rise and growth of the movement as the achievement of maturity for heavy metal, after its birth in the early 1970s and before branching out into various subgenres in the following years. British heavy metal fans, commonly known as muthas, metalheads or <a href="headbanging">headbangers</a> for the violent, rhythmic shaking of their heads in time to the music, dismissed the simplistic image of rebellious youth inherited from the <a href="counterculture%20of%20the%201960s">counterculture of the 1960s</a> and the psychedelic attachments characteristic of heavy rock in the 1970s, updating the shared principles and codes of the <a href="heavy%20metal%20subculture">heavy metal subculture</a> and definitely separating it from mainstream society.
Towards the end of the 1970s, British metalheads coalesced into a closed community of peers that exalted <a href="Power%20%28social%20and%20political%29">power</a> and celebrated <a href="masculinity">masculinity</a>. According to Deena Weinstein's analysis, their male camaraderie and the general absence of women in their ranks did not turn into <a href="machismo">machismo</a> and <a href="misogyny">misogyny</a>. In the same article, she wrote that British heavy metal: "is not racist, despite its uniformly white performers, and its lyrics are devoid of racial references." Another characteristic of the subculture was its latent <a href="homophobia">homophobia</a>, less violent, but not dissimilar to British <a href="skinhead">skinhead</a>s' disposition; in his book "Running with the Devil: Power, Gender and Madness in Heavy Metal Music", <a href="Robert%20Walser%20%28musicologist%29">Robert Walser</a> calls it a "collective affirmation of heterosexuality", and in a journal British sociologist John Clarke regards it as "a reaction against the erosion of traditionally available stereotypes of masculinity".

Headbangers showed little interest in political and social problems, finding in each other's company, in the consumption of <a href="Beer%23Society%20and%20culture">beer</a> and in the music, the means to escape their bleak reality; for this reason they were often accused of <a href="nihilism">nihilism</a> or <a href="escapism">escapism</a>. In contrast with punks, they loved musicianship and made idols of <a href="virtuoso">virtuoso</a> guitarists and vocalists, viewing the live show as the full realisation of their status. The fans were very loyal to the music, to each other and to the bands with whom they shared origins and from whom they required coherence with their values, <a href="Authenticity%20%28philosophy%29">authenticity</a> and continuous accessibility. To depart from this strict code meant being marked as a "<a href="selling%20out">sell out</a>" or "<a href="Poseur%23Heavy%20metal%20subculture">poseur</a>" and being somewhat excluded from the community. The lyrics of the song "Denim and Leather" by <a href="Saxon%20%28band%29">Saxon</a> reflect precisely the condition of British metalheads in those years of great enthusiasm. Access to this male-dominated world for female musicians and fans was not easy, and only women who adapted to their male counterparts' standards and codes were accepted, as attested by <a href="Girlschool">Girlschool</a> and <a href="Rock%20Goddess">Rock Goddess</a>, the only notable all-female heavy metal bands of that era.
The music, philosophy and lifestyle of heavy metal bands and fans were often panned by both left-wing critics and conservative public opinion, described as senseless, ridiculous to the limit of self-parody, and even dangerous for the young generation. The 1984 <a href="mockumentary">mockumentary</a> "<a href="This%20Is%20Spinal%20Tap">This Is Spinal Tap</a>" addressed many idiosyncrasies of British metal bands, showing comic sides of that world which external observers would judge absurd. Instead metal musicians regarded the movie's content as much too real.

The dress code of the British headbangers reflected the newly found cohesion of the movement and recalled the look of 1960s <a href="Rocker%20%28subculture%29">rockers</a> and <a href="Outlaw%20motorcycle%20club">American bikers</a>. The common elements were long hair and jeans, black or white T-shirts with band logos and cover art and leather jackets or denim vests adorned with patches. Following the example of Judas Priest, elements of <a href="Leather%20subculture">S&M</a> fashion entered the metal wardrobe of the 1980s and it became typical to show off metallic studs and ornaments, or for metal musicians to wear <a href="spandex">spandex</a> or leather trousers. Elements of <a href="militaria">militaria</a>, such as bullet belts and insignia, were also introduced at this time. This style of dress quickly became the uniform of metalheads worldwide.

Most bands of the NWOBHM had the same look as their fans and produced rock shows without special visual effects. A notable exception was <a href="Iron%20Maiden">Iron Maiden</a>, which created the grisly character <a href="Eddie%20%28mascot%29">Eddie the Head</a> as a stage prop to enrich their performances very early in their career. Other exceptions were <a href="Demon%20%28band%29">Demon</a>, <a href="Cloven%20Hoof%20%28band%29">Cloven Hoof</a> and <a href="Samson%20%28band%29">Samson</a>, which used various props, costumes and tricks in their shows, while <a href="Pagan%20Altar">Pagan Altar</a> and <a href="Venom%20%28band%29">Venom</a> became well known for their elaborate <a href="scenography">scenography</a> inspired by <a href="shock%20rock">shock rock</a> and <a href="Satanism">Satanism</a>.

The NWOBHM – comprising bands with very different influences and styles – was promoted as both a movement and a distinct music genre only in its formative years during the mid-to-late 1970s. Especially in those early years, what characterised the flood of new music was its raw sound, due in large part to low-budget productions, but also to the amateurish talents of many young bands. Those young musicians were also linked by a shared inspiration from the works of the aforementioned successful heavy rock bands of the late 1960s and 1970s, and kept a sort of continuity with the earlier acts, whose music had temporarily gone out of fashion, but was still thriving underground. However, the media of the 1980s and the promotional literature of record labels typically placed rock music that employed loud guitars, but was not classifiable as "punk" under the <a href="blanket%20term">blanket term</a> "heavy metal", subsuming the entire spectrum of NWOBHM bands within a single music genre.

Following a largely organic and uncalculated impulse, many of these new bands infused <a href="Traditional%20heavy%20metal">classic heavy metal</a> with the immediacy of <a href="Pub%20rock%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">pub rock</a> and the intensity of punk rock, implementing to various degrees the crossover of genres started by Motörhead; in general they shunned ballads, de-emphasised harmonies and produced shorter songs with fast tempos and a very aggressive sound based on <a href="Ostinato%23Riff">riffs</a> and <a href="power%20chord">power chord</a>s, featuring vocals ranging from high pitched wails to gruff and low growls. Iron Maiden, <a href="Angel%20Witch">Angel Witch</a>, Saxon, <a href="Holocaust%20%28band%29">Holocaust</a>, <a href="Tygers%20of%20Pan%20Tang">Tygers of Pan Tang</a>, Girlschool, <a href="Tank%20%28band%29">Tank</a> and <a href="More%20%28British%20band%29">More</a> are notable performers of this style, which bands such as <a href="Atomkraft">Atomkraft</a>, <a href="Jaguar%20%28band%29">Jaguar</a>, <a href="Raven%20%28British%20band%29">Raven</a> and Venom stretched to produce even more extreme results. Critics consider this new approach to heavy metal the greatest musical accomplishment of the NWOBHM and an important evolutionary step for the genre.
A style more melodic and more akin to the hard rock of bands like <a href="Rainbow%20%28rock%20band%29">Rainbow</a>, <a href="Magnum%20%28band%29">Magnum</a>, UFO, Thin Lizzy and <a href="Whitesnake">Whitesnake</a> was equally represented during the NWOBHM. The music of <a href="Def%20Leppard">Def Leppard</a>, <a href="Praying%20Mantis%20%28band%29">Praying Mantis</a>, <a href="White%20Spirit%20%28band%29">White Spirit</a>, Demon, <a href="Shy%20%28band%29">Shy</a>, Gaskin, <a href="Dedringer">Dedringer</a> and many others, contained <a href="Hook%20%28music%29">hooks</a> as much as riffs, often retained a closer link with <a href="blues%20rock">blues rock</a>, included <a href="power%20ballad">power ballad</a>s and featured keyboards, acoustic instruments and melodic and soaring vocals. After the peak of the movement in 1981, this style was favoured by the media and gained greater acceptance among the British audience; it became prevalent when bands usually playing the more aggressive style of metal adapted to the more popular sound, which resembled that of mainstream American acts. These changes in musical direction disoriented some fans and led them to reject those bands which were perceived as having compromised key elements of their musical identity in the pursuit of success.

These two styles do not exhaust all of the musical influences found in the British heavy metal music of the early 1980s, because many bands were also inspired by progressive rock (Iron Maiden, <a href="Diamond%20Head%20%28band%29">Diamond Head</a>, <a href="Blitzkrieg%20%28heavy%20metal%20band%29">Blitzkrieg</a>, Demon, Saracen, Shiva, <a href="Witchfynde">Witchfynde</a>), <a href="boogie%20rock">boogie rock</a> (Saxon, <a href="Vardis">Vardis</a>, <a href="Spider%20%28British%20band%29">Spider</a>, Le Griffe) and <a href="glam%20rock">glam rock</a> (<a href="Girl%20%28band%29">Girl</a>, <a href="Wrathchild">Wrathchild</a>). <a href="Doom%20metal">Doom metal</a> bands Pagan Altar and <a href="Witchfinder%20General%20%28band%29">Witchfinder General</a> were also part of the NWOBHM and their albums are considered among the best examples of that already established subgenre.

British writer John Tucker writes that NWOBHM bands were in general fuelled by their first experiences with adult life and "their lyrics rolled everything into one big youthful fantasy". They usually avoided social and political themes in their lyrics, or treated them in a shallow "street-level" way, preferring topics from <a href="mythology">mythology</a>, the <a href="occult">occult</a>, <a href="fantasy">fantasy</a>, <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> and <a href="horror%20film">horror film</a>s. Songs about romance and lust were rare, but the frequent lyrics about <a href="male%20bonding">male bonding</a> and the rock lifestyle contain many <a href="sexism">sexist</a> allusions. <a href="Christian%20symbolism">Christian symbolism</a> is often present in the lyrics and cover art, as is the figure of <a href="Satan">Satan</a>, used more as a shocking and <a href="macabre">macabre</a> subject than as the <a href="antireligion">antireligious</a> device of 1990s' <a href="black%20metal">black metal</a> subculture.

Thin Lizzy, UFO and Judas Priest were already playing international arenas, when new heavy metal bands, composed of very young people, debuted in small venues in many cities in the UK. The country's larger venues were usually reserved for chart-topping disco music, because their use as rock music clubs was considered much less profitable. Like most British bands in the past, the new groups spent their formative years playing live in clubs, pubs, dance halls and social circles for low wages; this training honed their skills, created a local fan base and enabled them to come in contact with managers and record label agents.

Angel Witch, Iron Maiden, Praying Mantis and Samson from London, Son of a Bitch (later Saxon) from <a href="Barnsley">Barnsley</a>, Diamond Head from <a href="Stourbridge">Stourbridge</a>, <a href="Marseille%20%28band%29">Marseille</a> from <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, White Spirit from <a href="Hartlepool">Hartlepool</a>, Witchfynde from <a href="Derbyshire">Derbyshire</a>, Vardis from <a href="Wakefield">Wakefield</a>, Def Leppard from <a href="Sheffield">Sheffield</a>, Raven and Tygers of Pan Tang from around <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle</a>, and Holocaust from <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> were the most important metal bands founded between 1975 and 1977 that animated the club scene in their respective cities and towns. The first bands of the newborn musical movement competed for space in venues with punk outfits, often causing clubs to specialise, presenting only punk or only rock and hard rock. Differences in ideology, attitude and looks also caused heated rivalries between the two audiences. What punk and NWOBHM musicians had in common was their <a href="DIY%20ethic">"do-it-yourself"</a> attitude toward the music business and the consequent practice of self-production and self-distribution of recorded material in the form of <a href="Compact%20Cassette">audio cassette</a> <a href="Demo%20%28music%29">demos</a>, or privately pressed singles, aimed initially at local supporters.

It also led to the birth and diffusion of small <a href="independent%20record%20labels">independent record labels</a>, often an extension of record shops and independent recording studios, which sometimes produced both punk and metal releases. Indie labels are considered important to the movement's evolution, because they removed the intrusion of corporate business which had hindered rock music in the late 1970s, giving local bands the chance to experiment with more extreme forms of music.
While British and international media covered punk intensively, the new <a href="grassroots">grassroots</a> metal movement remained underground until 1978, largely ignored by popular music magazines such as "<a href="NME">New Musical Express</a>", "<a href="The%20Face%20%28magazine%29">The Face</a>" and "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>" and by radio stations. News about the bands and music circulated by word-of-mouth and <a href="fanzine">fanzine</a>s, or through interested DJs, who travelled the country from club to club. <a href="Neal%20Kay">Neal Kay</a> was one of those DJs; he started to work in 1975 at a called The Bandwagon in Kingsbury, North West London, housed in the back-room of the Prince of Wales pub and equipped with a massive sound system. He transformed his nights at The Bandwagon into The Heavy Metal Soundhouse, a spot specialising in hard rock and heavy metal music and a place to listen to albums of established acts and to demos of new bands, which circulated among fans through <a href="Cassette%20culture%23United%20Kingdom">cassette trading</a>.

Besides participating in <a href="air%20guitar">air guitar</a> competitions and watching live shows, the audience could also vote for Kay's selections. The DJ made a weekly Heavy Metal Top 100 list of the most requested songs at The Soundhouse, by both newcomers and established bands and sent it to record shops and to the music journal "<a href="Sounds%20%28magazine%29">Sounds</a>", the only paper that showed interest in the developing scene. Many young musicians realised that they were not alone in playing metal only through that weekly list, which included bands from all over the country. At the time, <a href="Geoff%20Barton">Geoff Barton</a> was a staffer at "Sounds" who wrote features on the new up-and-coming metal bands and was pivotal in directing the developing subculture of metalheads with his articles. At the suggestion of his editor Alan Lewis and in an attempt to find a common stylistic element in the bands' music, he used the term "New Wave of British Heavy Metal" for the first time in his review of a gig on the "Metal Crusade" tour featuring Angel Witch, Iron Maiden and Samson at <a href="KOKO%20%28music%20venue%29">The Music Machine</a> in London on 8 May 1979. The term soon became the identifier for the whole movement.

<a href="Compilation%20album">Compilation album</a>s featuring bands from the nascent movement started to circulate, issued by <a href="Neat%20Records">Neat Records</a>, Heavy Metal Records and Ebony Records, companies that became leaders in the independent metal label market during the 1980s. The fresh outlet of Neal Kay's chart, the attention of "Sounds" and the many compilations issued by independent labels, focused the efforts of the new bands on producing demos and singles. Iron Maiden's "<a href="The%20Soundhouse%20Tapes">The Soundhouse Tapes</a>" is one of the best known collections of such demos. As Barton recalled: "There were hundreds of these bands. Maybe even thousands. Barely a day would go by without a clutch of new NWOBHM singles arriving in the "Sounds" office."

<a href="Tommy%20Vance">Tommy Vance</a>, a BBC radio host, took notice of the phenomenon and played singles by the new metal bands on his late night "<a href="Friday%20Rock%20Show">Friday Rock Show</a>" on <a href="BBC%20Radio%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B1">BBC Radio 1</a>. Along with John Peel's broadcast, Vance's was the only mainstream radio show to feature songs from underground metal acts, many of whom were invited to play live at BBC studios under the supervision of long-time collaborator and producer, Tony Wilson. <a href="Alice%27s%20Restaurant%20Rock%20Radio">Alice's Restaurant Rock Radio</a>, a <a href="Pirate%20radio">pirate FM radio</a> station in London, also championed the new bands on air and with their own "roadshow" in rock pubs and clubs.

Despite the transition of the young bands from being local attractions to touring extensively in the UK, <a href="major%20record%20labels">major record labels</a>' <a href="A%26amp%3BR">A&R</a> agents still did not recognise the rising new trend. Thus, most new bands signed contracts with small independent labels, which could afford only limited printings of singles and albums and usually offered only national distribution. Many other bands, including Iron Maiden, Def Leppard and Diamond Head, self-produced their first releases and sold them through mail order or at concerts. Saxon were the first to sign with an internationally distributed label, the French <a href="Carrere%20Records">Carrere Records</a>, followed by Def Leppard with <a href="Phonogram%20Records">Phonogram</a> in August 1979, and Iron Maiden with <a href="EMI">EMI</a> in December 1979. In early 1980, EMI tested the market with the Neal Kay-compiled album "<a href="Metal%20for%20Muthas">Metal for Muthas</a>" and a UK tour of the bands that had contributed to the compilation, eventually signing Angel Witch (who were dropped after the release of their first single) and <a href="Ethel%20the%20Frog%20%28band%29">Ethel the Frog</a>.

"Sounds" gave "Metal for Muthas" a poor review, but the album was nevertheless a commercial success and may have been instrumental in encouraging major labels to sign a few more bands. <a href="A%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BZ">A II Z</a>, <a href="Fist%20%28band%29">Fist</a>, White Spirit and Praying Mantis were dropped after the release of their debut albums, while Tygers of Pan Tang, Samson, More, Demon and Girlschool had more success and lasted longer on major labels' line-ups. The new releases by these bands were better produced and some of them, with the support of intensive tours in the UK and Europe, obtained good chart results. The best chart performances of that period were for Iron Maiden's debut album "<a href="Iron%20Maiden%20%28album%29">Iron Maiden</a>" and for "<a href="Wheels%20of%20Steel">Wheels of Steel</a>" by Saxon, which reached No. 4 and No. 5 on the UK Albums Chart respectively, while their singles "<a href="Running%20Free">Running Free</a>", "Wheels of Steel" and "<a href="747%20%28Strangers%20in%20the%20Night%29">747 (Strangers in the Night)</a>" entered the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a> Top 50. The immediate consequence of that success was increased media coverage for metal bands, which included appearances on the British music TV shows "<a href="Top%20of%20the%20Pops">Top of the Pops</a>" and "<a href="The%20Old%20Grey%20Whistle%20Test">The Old Grey Whistle Test</a>". The emergence of many new bands in the period between 1978 and 1980 was another remarkable effect of the promotion of the movement to a relevant national phenomenon.

The momentum behind the NWOBHM also benefited already established bands, which reclaimed the spotlight with new and acclaimed releases. Ex-Deep Purple singer <a href="Ian%20Gillan">Ian Gillan</a> returned to sing heavy metal with the album "<a href="Mr.%20Universe%20%28album%29">Mr. Universe</a>" in 1979 and was on the forefront of the British metal scene with his band <a href="Gillan%20%28band%29">Gillan</a> in the following years. His former Deep Purple bandmate <a href="Ritchie%20Blackmore">Ritchie Blackmore</a> also climbed the UK charts with his hard rock group Rainbow's releases "<a href="Down%20to%20Earth%20%28Rainbow%20album%29">Down to Earth</a>" (1979) and "<a href="Difficult%20to%20Cure">Difficult to Cure</a>" (1981). Black Sabbath recovered and returned to success with the albums "<a href="Heaven%20and%20Hell%20%28Black%20Sabbath%20album%29">Heaven and Hell</a>" (1980) and "<a href="Mob%20Rules%20%28album%29">Mob Rules</a>" (1981), featuring the ex-Rainbow singer <a href="Ronnie%20James%20Dio">Ronnie James Dio</a>. 1980 saw several other entries by hard rock and heavy metal bands in the top 10 of the British charts: <a href="Michael%20Schenker%20Group">MSG</a>'s <a href="The%20Michael%20Schenker%20Group%20%28album%29">first album</a> peaked at No. 8, Whitesnake's "<a href="Ready%20an%27%20Willing">Ready an' Willing</a>" at No. 6, Judas Priest's best-seller "<a href="British%20Steel%20%28album%29">British Steel</a>" and Motörhead's "<a href="Ace%20of%20Spades%20%28album%29">Ace of Spades</a>" at No. 4, while "<a href="Back%20in%20Black">Back in Black</a>" by AC/DC reached number one.

As proof of the successful revival of the British hard rock and metal scene, tours and gigs of old and new acts were sold out, both at home and in other European countries, where the movement had spread. Groups arising from the NWOBHM were no longer precluded from world tours and were often chosen as opening acts for major bands in arenas and stadiums. Iron Maiden supported Kiss in Europe in 1980, embarking on their first world tour as headliners in 1981, as well as opening for Judas Priest and UFO in the US. Def Leppard visited the US for the first time in 1980 for a three-month trek supporting <a href="Pat%20Travers">Pat Travers</a>, Judas Priest, <a href="Ted%20Nugent">Ted Nugent</a>, AC/DC and <a href="Sammy%20Hagar">Sammy Hagar</a>. Saxon opened for Judas Priest in Europe and for Rush and AC/DC in the US in 1981. NWOBHM bands were already present on the roster of the famous <a href="Reading%20and%20Leeds%20Festivals">Reading Festival</a> in 1980, and were quickly promoted to headliners for the 1981 and 1982 events. The 1980 edition was also remarkable for the violent protests against Def Leppard, whose declared interest in the American market was received badly by British fans. In addition to Reading, a new festival called <a href="Monsters%20of%20Rock">Monsters of Rock</a> was created in 1980 at <a href="Castle%20Donington">Castle Donington</a>, England, to showcase only hard rock and heavy metal acts.

The NWOBHM eventually found space in newspapers and music magazines other than "Sounds", as journalists caught up with the "next big thing" happening in the UK. "Melody Maker" even published a weekly heavy metal chart based on record shop sales. "Sounds" publisher exploited his support of the movement to launch the first issue of "<a href="Kerrang%21">Kerrang!</a>", a colour magazine directed by Geoff Barton devoted exclusively to hard rock and heavy metal, in June 1981. "Kerrang!" was an unexpected success and soon became the reference magazine for metalheads worldwide, followed shortly by the American "<a href="Circus%20%28magazine%29">Circus</a>" and "<a href="Hit%20Parader">Hit Parader</a>", the German "<a href="Metal%20Hammer">Metal Hammer</a>" and the British "<a href="Metal%20Forces">Metal Forces</a>". The attention of international media meant more record sales and more world tours for NWOBHM bands, whose albums entered many foreign charts. Their attempts to climb the British charts culminated in Iron Maiden's "<a href="The%20Number%20of%20the%20Beast%20%28album%29">The Number of the Beast</a>" topping the UK Albums Chart on 10 April 1982 and staying at number 1 for two weeks. The album charted at number 33 in the US, where the band acquired a reputation as Devil-worshippers due to the album cover's depiction of a hellish scene.

The success of the music produced by the movement and its passage from underground phenomenon to mainstream genre, prompted its main promoter Geoff Barton to declare the NWOBHM finished in 1981. He felt disappointed by the low quality of the new bands and frustrated by the ease with which record labels exploited enthusiasm for heavy metal. Coincidentally, in the same year, the Bandwagon was closed and the Prince of Wales pub was subsequently demolished to build a restaurant. Although the movement had lost some of its appeal for diehard fans, as evidenced by the increased popularity of American-influenced <a href="Album-oriented%20rock">AOR</a> releases on sales-based national polls, it retained enough vitality to launch a second wave of bands, which rose from the underground and released their first albums in 1982 and 1983.

NWOBHM bands had been touring steadily in the United States, but had not yet received enough FM radio airplay there to make a significant impression on American charts. Def Leppard remedied that, releasing "<a href="Pyromania%20%28album%29">Pyromania</a>" at the beginning of 1983, an album with a more melodic and FM-friendly approach in comparison with the more aggressive sound of their earlier music. The band's goal of reaching a wider international audience, which included many female fans, was attained completely in the US, where "Pyromania" peaked at No. 2 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> chart behind <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>'s "<a href="Thriller%20%28Michael%20Jackson%20album%29">Thriller</a>". Thanks to a string of hit singles and the heavy rotation of their <a href="music%20videos">music videos</a> on the recently launched <a href="MTV">MTV</a>, the album had sold more than six millions copies in the US by 1984 and made Def Leppard superstars. The overwhelming international success of "Pyromania" induced both American and British bands to follow Def Leppard's example, giving a decisive boost to the more commercial and melodic <a href="glam%20metal">glam metal</a> and heralding the end of the NWOBHM.

The UK had been a home for <a href="music%20video">music video</a> pioneers. When the music video cable channel <a href="MTV">MTV</a> started broadcasting in 1982, the importance of videos abruptly grew, changing the video from an occasional promotional tool to an indispensable means of reaching an audience. MTV filled its programs with many hard rock and heavy metal videos, but these were too expensive for bands who either had no recording contract or had signed to small, independent labels. Moreover, music videos exalted the visual appeal of a band, an area where some British metal groups were deficient. So the NWOBHM suffered the same decline as other musical phenomena that were based on low-budget productions and an underground following. Many of its leaders, such as Diamond Head, Tygers of Pan Tang, Angel Witch and Samson, were unable to follow up on their initial success; their attempts to update their look and sound to match new expectations of the wider audience not only failed, but also alienated their original fans.

By the mid-1980s, image-driven, sex-celebrating glam metal emanating from Hollywood's <a href="Sunset%20Strip">Sunset Strip</a>, spearheaded by <a href="Van%20Halen">Van Halen</a> and followed by bands such as <a href="M%C3%B6tley%20Cr%C3%BCe">Mötley Crüe</a>, <a href="Quiet%20Riot">Quiet Riot</a>, <a href="Dokken">Dokken</a>, <a href="Great%20White">Great White</a>, <a href="Ratt">Ratt</a> and <a href="W.A.S.P.%20%28band%29">W.A.S.P.</a>, quickly replaced other styles of metal in the tastes of many British rock fans. New Jersey act <a href="Bon%20Jovi">Bon Jovi</a> and the Swedish <a href="Europe%20%28band%29">Europe</a>, thanks to their successful fusion of hard rock and romantic pop, also became very popular in the UK, with the former even headlining the 1987 Monsters of Rock Festival. Record companies latched on to the more polished glam metal subgenre over the NWOBHM bands, which maintained a fan base elsewhere in Europe, but found themselves crowded out of the UK and US markets by the success of these American groups. While the attention devoted to the NWOBHM bands waned, a new succession of far less mainstream metal subgenres began to emerge and attract many British metalheads. <a href="Power%20metal">Power metal</a> and <a href="thrash%20metal">thrash metal</a>, both stemming from the NWOBHM and maintaining much of its ethos, were gaining critical acclaim and commercial success in the second half of the 1980s with their even faster and heavier sound. Bands such as <a href="Helloween">Helloween</a>, <a href="Savatage">Savatage</a>, <a href="Metallica">Metallica</a>, <a href="Slayer">Slayer</a>, <a href="Megadeth">Megadeth</a>, and <a href="Anthrax%20%28American%20band%29">Anthrax</a> captured much of the market share of those metalheads who were not content with the sound or style of more mainstream, pop-oriented metal bands.

"The N.W.O.B.H.M. Encyclopedia" by Malc Macmillan lists more than 500 recording bands established in the decade between 1975 and 1985 and related to the movement. Probably as many bands launched in the same period, but never emerged from their local club scene, or recorded nothing more than demo tapes or limited pressings of self-produced singles. The disinterest of record labels, poor management of bands, internal struggles and musical choices that turned off much of their original fan base, resulted in most groups disbanding and disappearing by the end of the decade. A few of the best known groups, such as Praying Mantis in Japan and Saxon, Demon and <a href="Tokyo%20Blade">Tokyo Blade</a> in mainland Europe, survived in foreign markets. Some others, namely Raven, Girlschool and <a href="Grim%20Reaper%20%28band%29">Grim Reaper</a>, tried to break through in the US market signing with American labels, but their attempts were unsuccessful. Two of the more popular bands of the movement, however, went on to considerable, lasting success. Iron Maiden has since become one of the most commercially successful and influential heavy metal bands of all time, even after adopting a more progressive style. Def Leppard became even more successful, targeting the American <a href="mainstream%20rock">mainstream rock</a> market with their more refined hard rock sound.

The widespread popularity of the Internet in the late 1990s/early 2000s helped NWOBHM fans and musicians to reconnect and rekindle their shared enthusiasm. The NWOBHM experienced a minor revival, highlighted by the good sales of old vinyl and collectibles and by the demand for new performances. Statements of appreciation by metal bands of the 1990s, the success of <a href="tribute%20band">tribute band</a>s, the re-issues of old albums and the production of new thoroughly edited compilations, attracted the media's attention and encouraged many of the original groups to reunite for festival appearances and tours. According to Macmillan and <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia, probably the most important of those compilation albums was "<a href="New%20Wave%20of%20British%20Heavy%20Metal%20%2779%20Revisited">New Wave of British Heavy Metal '79 Revisited</a>", compiled by Metallica's drummer <a href="Lars%20Ulrich">Lars Ulrich</a> and former "Sounds" and "Kerrang!" journalist Geoff Barton. It was released in 1990 as a double CD, featuring bands as obscure as <a href="Hollow%20Ground%20%28band%29">Hollow Ground</a> right through to the major acts of the era.

A new publication called "<a href="Classic%20Rock%20%28magazine%29">Classic Rock</a>", featuring Barton and many of the writers from "Kerrang!"'s first run, championed the NWOBHM revival and continues to focus much of its attention on rock acts from the 1980s. Starting in the 2000s, many reunited bands recorded new albums and revisited their original styles, abandoned in the second half of the 1980s. Their presence, at metal festivals and on the international rock club circuit, has been constant ever since.

The NWOBHM triggered a renaissance in a stagnant rock genre, but took on heavy criticism for the excessive local media hype surrounding a legion of typically mediocre musicians. Detractors think that, unlike heavy metal of the preceding decades, their music was unoriginal and included no classic rock recordings. Nevertheless, these bands and their diverse output offered a blueprint that counterparts across the Western world would later emulate and expand. The collision of styles that characterised the NWOBHM is now seen as key to the diversification of heavy metal in the second half of the 1980s into various subgenres that came to the fore in the 1990s. The stardom of Def Leppard in the US provided a catalyst for the growth of glam metal, just as bands like Angel Witch, Witchfynde, Cloven Hoof and especially Venom generated the music, lyrics, cover art and attitude that sparked black metal in its various forms in Europe and America. Motörhead, Iron Maiden, Raven, Tank, Venom and other minor groups are viewed as precursors of <a href="speed%20metal">speed metal</a> and thrash metal, two subgenres which carried forward the crossover with punk, incorporating elements of <a href="hardcore%20punk">hardcore</a> while amplifying volume, velocity and aggressive tone.

Starting around 1982, distant points such as North America, West Germany, and Brazil each became the locus of its own distinctive thrash metal scenes – East Coast and <a href="Bay%20Area%20thrash%20metal">Bay Area</a>, <a href="Teutonic%20thrash%20metal">Teutonic</a>, and <a href="Brazilian%20thrash%20metal">Brazilian thrash metal</a>. Their debt to the NWOBHM was acknowledged for example by Metallica's Lars Ulrich, an active fan and avid collector of NWOBHM recordings and memorabilia. Under his influence, the setlists of Metallica's early shows were filled with covers of British metal groups. The sound of the NWOBHM even "cross-pollinated" a subgenre of punk, as <a href="Street%20punk%23UK%2082">UK 82 street punk</a> bands like <a href="Discharge%20%28band%29">Discharge</a> blended punk music with elements of metal. The birth of speed metal in the early 1980s was also pivotal for the evolution of power metal in the latter half of the decade, as exemplified by Helloween from Germany, and <a href="Manowar">Manowar</a>, Savatage, and <a href="Virgin%20Steele">Virgin Steele</a> from the US.
Since the beginning of the NWOBHM, North American bands like <a href="Anvil%20%28band%29">Anvil</a>, <a href="Riot%20%28band%29">Riot</a>, <a href="Twisted%20Sister">Twisted Sister</a>, Manowar, Virgin Steele, <a href="The%20Rods">The Rods</a>, <a href="Hellion%20%28band%29">Hellion</a>, <a href="Cirith%20Ungol%20%28band%29">Cirith Ungol</a>, and <a href="Exciter%20%28band%29">Exciter</a> had a continuous exchange with the other side of the Atlantic, where their music was appreciated by British metalheads. In this climate of reciprocity, Manowar and Virgin Steele initially signed with the British indie label <a href="Music%20for%20Nations">Music for Nations</a>, while Twisted Sister recorded their first two albums in London.

The sound of Japanese bands <a href="Earthshaker%20%28band%29">Earthshaker</a>, <a href="Loudness%20%28band%29">Loudness</a>, <a href="Anthem%20%28band%29">Anthem</a> and other minor groups was also influenced by the NWOBHM, whose British sound engineers were used for their early albums. The Japanese band <a href="Bow%20Wow%20%28band%29">Bow Wow</a> even transferred to England to be part of the British metal scene. Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands, France and Spain promptly welcomed the new British bands and spawned imitators almost immediately. Acts like <a href="Accept%20%28band%29">Accept</a>, <a href="Grave%20Digger%20%28band%29">Grave Digger</a>, <a href="Sinner%20%28band%29">Sinner</a> and <a href="Warlock%20%28band%29">Warlock</a> from Germany, <a href="E.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BF.%20Band">E. F. Band</a> from Sweden, <a href="Mercyful%20Fate">Mercyful Fate</a> from Denmark, <a href="Killer%20%28Belgian%20band%29">Killer</a> and <a href="Ostrogoth%20%28band%29">Ostrogoth</a> from Belgium, <a href="Picture%20%28band%29">Picture</a> and <a href="Bodine%20%28band%29">Bodine</a> from the Netherlands, <a href="Trust%20%28French%20band%29">Trust</a> and <a href="Nightmare%20%28French%20band%29">Nightmare</a> from France, and <a href="Bar%C3%B3n%20Rojo">Barón Rojo</a> and <a href="%C3%81ngeles%20del%20Infierno">Ángeles del Infierno</a> from Spain, formed between 1978 and 1982 and were heavily influenced by the sound of the NWOBHM. Many of these bands signed with the Dutch <a href="Roadrunner%20Records">Roadrunner Records</a> or with the Belgian <a href="Mausoleum%20Records">Mausoleum Records</a>, independent labels that also published recordings of British NWOBHM acts.

Catopsbaatar

Catopsbaatar is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="multituberculate">multituberculate</a>, an <a href="extinct">extinct</a> <a href="Order%20%28biology%29">order</a> of <a href="rodent">rodent</a>-like <a href="mammals">mammals</a>. It lived in what is now <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a> during the late <a href="Campanian">Campanian</a> age of the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> <a href="Period%20%28geology%29">Period</a>, about 72 million years ago. The first fossils were collected in the early 1970s, and the animal was named as a new species of the genus "<a href="Djadochtatherium%20">Djadochtatherium </a>" in 1974, "D. catopsaloides". The <a href="Specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> refers to the animal's similarity to the genus "<a href="Catopsalis">Catopsalis</a>". The species was moved to the genus "Catopsalis" in 1979, and received its own genus ("Catopsbaatar", Greek and Mongolian for "visible hero") in 1994. Five skulls, one molar, and one skeleton with a skull are known; the latter is the genus' most complete specimen. "Catopsbaatar" was a member of the family <a href="Djadochtatheriidae">Djadochtatheriidae</a>.

The skull of "Catopsbaatar" was up to long and, as in other multituberculates, proportionally large. The external appearance of their heads may have been similar to those of rodents. The skull was heavy-set and wide, with the <a href="zygomatic%20arches">zygomatic arches</a> strongly expanded to the sides. The eye sockets were smaller and placed further back than in its relatives, and the snout was more elongated. "Catopsbaatar" had semicircular ridges on the side of the skull, to which the jaw muscles were attached. The <a href="mandible">mandible</a> was strong and very elongated. It had very robust <a href="incisors">incisors</a>, and cheek teeth with multiple <a href="Cusp%20%28anatomy%29">cusps</a> (for which multituberculates are named). The <a href="pelvic%20bones">pelvic bones</a> differed from those of other multituberculates in that they were not fused to each other. "Catopsbaatar" had <a href="Spur%20%28zoology%29">spurs</a> on its ankles, like those of the male <a href="platypus">platypus</a> and <a href="echidna">echidna</a>, without evidence of a <a href="venom">venom</a> canal (present in the former).

The spurs of "Catopsbaatar" and other <a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> mammals may have been used for protection against <a href="theropod">theropod</a> <a href="dinosaurs">dinosaurs</a> and other predators. Multituberculates are thought to have given <a href="Viviparity">live birth</a>, and the fact that they had hair indicates that they were <a href="homeothermic">homeothermic</a> ("warmblooded"). Multituberculates would have been <a href="omnivorous">omnivorous</a>; "Catopsbaatar" had powerful jaw muscles, and its incisors were well adapted for gnawing hard seeds, using a backwards chewing stroke. Multituberculates are thought to have had a sprawling posture, and "Catopsbaatar" may have been able to jump. "Catopsbaatar" is known from the <a href="Red%20Beds%20of%20Hermiin%20Tsav">Red Beds of Hermiin Tsav</a> and the <a href="Barun%20Goyot%20Formation">Barun Goyot Formation</a> in Mongolia, which are thought to be the same geologic age (about 72 million years old).

In 1970 and 1971, the Polish-Mongolian Palaeontological Expeditions collected mammalian fossils from the <a href="Red%20Beds%20of%20Hermiin%20Tsav">Red Beds of Hermiin Tsav</a> formation in Mongolia's <a href="Gobi%20Desert">Gobi Desert</a>. About 100 specimens, recovered from four localitions, are housed at the <a href="Polish%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Polish Academy of Sciences</a> in Warsaw. Two-thirds of the collected specimens were <a href="multituberculates">multituberculates</a>: an extinct <a href="Order%20%28biology%29">order</a> of mammals with <a href="rodent">rodent</a>-like dentition, named for the numerous <a href="Cusp%20%28anatomy%29">cusps</a> (or <a href="tubercles">tubercles</a>) on their <a href="Molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a>. In 1974, Polish palaeontologist <a href="Zofia%20Kielan-Jaworowska">Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska</a> named a new species of the Mongolian multituberculate genus "<a href="Djadochtatherium">Djadochtatherium</a>" as "D. catopsaloides", with specimen ZPAL MgM−I/78 from the Polish collection as the <a href="holotype">holotype</a>. The <a href="Specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> refers to the animal's similarity to the North American species "<a href="Catopsalis">Catopsalis</a> joyneri", which Kielan-Jaworowska thought was a possible descendant. The specimen, collected at the Hermiin Tsav I location, is an almost-complete skull of a juvenile with portions of the cranium damaged. Kielan-Jaworowska also assigned other specimens to the species: a damaged skull missing lower jaws (ZPAL MgM−I/79, an adult), a skull with partial lower jaws (ZPAL MgM−I/80), and a molar with a fragment of jaw (ZPAL MgM−I/159 from the <a href="Barun%20Goyot%20Formation">Barun Goyot Formation</a> of Khulsan, the only specimen not from Hermiin Tsav).

Kielan-Jaworowska and American palaeontologist Robert E. Sloan considered the genus "Djadochtatherium" a <a href="junior%20synonym">junior synonym</a> of "Catopsalis", and created the <a href="new%20combination">new combination</a> "C. catopsaloides" in 1979. American palaeontologists Nancy B. Simmons and Miao Desui conducted a 1986 <a href="cladistic%20analysis">cladistic analysis</a> which indicated that "Catopsalis" was a <a href="paraphyletic">paraphyletic</a> <a href="taxon">taxon</a> (an unnatural grouping of species), and "C. catopsaloides" required its own generic name. Kielan-Jaworowska followed Simmons and Miao's suggestion, moving "C. catopsaloides" to its own <a href="monotypic">monotypic</a> genus ("Catopsbaatar") in 1994. "Catops" is derived from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> word "katoptos" ("visible" or "evident"); "baatar" is Mongolian for "hero", and the name refers to "Catopsbaatar"'s similarity to the genus "Catopsalis" (as is the case for the specific name). The name "Catopsalis" itself consists of the Greek words for "visible" and "cutting shears" ("psalis").
Later in 1994, Kielan-Jaworowska and the Russian palaeontologist Petr P. Gambaryan mentioned caudal (tail) vertebrae which may have belonged to "Catopsbaatar"; this attribution is uncertain, since they may instead belong to the related "<a href="Tombaatar">Tombaatar</a>" (named in 1997). A fourth skull (PIN 4537/4, a juvenile), discovered during the 1975 Soviet−Mongolian Expedition, was mentioned by Gambaryan and Kielan-Jaworowska in 1995. Canadian palaontologist <a href="Phillip%20J.%20Currie">Phillip J. Currie</a> found a new "Catopsbaatar" specimen during the 1999 Dinosaurs of the Gobi expedition, organised by the American Nomadic Expeditions Company. Housed at the <a href="Mongolian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Mongolian Academy of Sciences</a> in <a href="Ulaanbaatar">Ulaanbaatar</a> as PM120/107, this most completely preserved known specimen consists of the complete skull (which may be slightly flattened) and partial skeleton of an adult individual. The specimen has rather complete fore- and hind limbs, which were unknown for the genus until then and which are generally rarely preserved in multituberculates. Its <a href="pelvis">pelvic</a> <a href="Ilium%20%28bone%29">ilia</a> were stolen and destroyed by a schoolboy on tour at the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%20of%20Oslo">Natural History Museum of Oslo</a>, when it was prepared in 2000. The specimen was reported in 2002 by Kielan-Jaworowska, Norwegian palaeontologist <a href="J%C3%B8rn%20Hurum">Jørn Hurum</a>, Currie and Mongolian palaeontologist <a href="Rinchen%20Barsbold">Rinchen Barsbold</a>, who also mentioned another skull (PIN 4537/5, a juvenile) found during the 1975 expedition. "Catopsalis joyneri", the basis of the name "C. catopsaloides", was moved to the new genus "<a href="Valenopsalis">Valenopsalis</a>" in 2015.

"Catopsbaatar" belonged to the order Multituberculata, a group within <a href="Allotheria">Allotheria</a> (an infraclass of <a href="mammals">mammals</a> outside <a href="Theria">Theria</a>, the group that contains modern <a href="placentals">placentals</a> and <a href="marsupials">marsupials</a>). Multituberculates are characterized by having <a href="premolars">premolars</a> and molars with multiple low cusps, arranged in longitudal rows. Multituberculates are the best-known group of mammals from the <a href="Mesozoic%20Era">Mesozoic Era</a>, when the <a href="dinosaurs">dinosaurs</a> dominated; although the earliest multituberculate remains are from the <a href="Jurassic%20Period">Jurassic Period</a>, the group is known as recently as the <a href="Eocene%20Epoch">Eocene Epoch</a> (thereby surviving the <a href="Cretaceous%E2%80%93Palaeogene%20extinction%20event">Cretaceous–Palaeogene extinction event</a>). The group may have become extinct due to competition with <a href="eutheria">eutheria</a>n mammals, such as rodents. Multituberculates were mainly known from teeth and jaws until the 1920s, when more complete specimens were discovered—first in Asia, and then elsewhere. <a href="Postcranial">Postcranial</a> bones (the rest of the skeleton, other than the skull) remain rare.

Kielan-Jaworowska originally classfied "Catopsbaatar" as a member of the multituberculate family <a href="Taeniolabididae">Taeniolabididae</a> in 1974. In 1994, she suggested that "Djadochtatherium" was close to "Catopsbaatar" ancestry. She and Hurum named a new family of multituberculates, <a href="Djadochtatheriidae">Djadochtatheriidae</a> (which they placed in the new suborder <a href="Djadochtatheria">Djadochtatheria</a>), in 1997. The family included the genera "Djadochtatherium", "Catopsbaatar", "<a href="Kryptobaatar">Kryptobaatar</a>", and "Tombaatar", all from the Gobi Desert. The family differs from other multituberculates (and other mammals) in that the front margins of its snout were confluent with the <a href="zygomatic%20arches">zygomatic arches</a> (cheekbones), giving the snout a <a href="trapezoid">trapezoid</a> shape when seen from above. In general, other mammals have snouts where the side margins are curved inward in front of the zygomatic arches. Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum revised the higher ranks within Multituberculata in 2001, replacing the suborder Djadochtatheria with the superfamily Djadochtatherioidea (placed in the suborder <a href="Cimolodonta">Cimolodonta</a>).
The following <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> shows the placement of "Catopsbaatar" among other multituberculates according to Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum, 1997:
The most complete adult "Catopsbaatar" skull (specimen PM 120/107) is long and wide, with a lower jaw. By comparison, the skull of the juvenile holotype (ZPAL MgM−I/78) is about long and wide, with a lower jaw. The largest adult skull (ZPAL MgM−I/79) is long but, since it is incomplete, its other measurements are unknown. "Catopsbaatar" was larger than its relatives, "Kryptobaatar" and "Djadochtatherium". Multituberculates had relatively large skulls and short necks; their skulls were proportionally longer and wider than those of similarly sized rodents and marsupials. The external appearance of their heads may have been similar to those of rodents.

The skull of "Catopsbaatar" was heavy-set, with a wide margin across the front. It was shorter along the midline than at the sides, because the <a href="nuchal%20crest">nuchal crest</a> at the back of the head curved inwards at the middle, creating an indention at the hind margin of the skull when viewed from above. The zygomatic arches were strongly expanded to the sides, with the skull width (across the arches) about 85 percent of the skull length. The front of the <a href="orbits">orbits</a> (eye sockets) were further back than in other djadochtatheriids, resulting in a more elongated snout (65 percent of the skull length) and small orbits. The <a href="premaxilla">premaxilla</a> (front bone of the upper jaw) extended less than two-thirds of the length of the snout in front of the eyes, shorter than that of "Kryptobaatar". The premaxilla consisted of parts of the face and the palate; djadochtatheriids had a premaxillary ridge on the boundary between the two (visible when viewing the skull from below). The palatal part of the premaxilla was concave, with many randomly arranged nutrient <a href="foramina">foramina</a> (openings). The <a href="nasal%20bone">nasal bone</a>—which formed the upper part of the snout—was relatively wide (becoming wider towards the back), and its front was covered with irregularly spaced vascular foramina. The <a href="Suture%20%28anatomy%29">suture</a> between the nasal and <a href="frontal%20bones">frontal bones</a> was less pointed forwards in the middle than were those of "Catopsbaatar"'s relatives. 
The <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a> (the main part of the upper jaw) was extensive, and formed most of the side of the snout. It contained all the upper teeth, except the <a href="incisors">incisors</a>. The <a href="infraorbital%20foramina">infraorbital foramina</a> (openings at the lower front of the maxilla) were slit-like in some specimens and rounded in others, and varied in number from one to three. One of the most characteristic features of the face of "Catopsbaatar" was the very large anterior zygomatic ridge on the sides of the upper jaw (a site for jaw-muscle attachment). It was much higher than in other djadochtatheriids except for "Djadochtatherium", from which it differed in that the ridge was semicircular rather than roughly trapezoidal (other genera have elliptical ridges). The front margin of the anterior zygomatic ridge was thickened, which produced a bulge on the side margin of the snout when viewed from the side and above. The lower part of the suture between the maxilla and the <a href="squamosal%20bone">squamosal bone</a> extended along the hind border of the anterior zygomatic ridge. The palatal processes of the maxilla formed most of the palate. The <a href="major%20palatine%20foramina">major palatine foramina</a> had shallow grooves extending forward. The <a href="Torus%20palatinus">postpalatine torus</a> (a bony protrusion on the palate) of "Catopsbaatar" was less prominent than was that of "Tombaatar". The frontal bone was large, and formed most of the cranial roof. The suture between the frontal and <a href="parietal%20bone">parietal bone</a>s formed a U-shaped part in the middle which pointed backwards—similar to the condition in "Kryptobaatar" but less deep, with smaller U-shaped structures at the sides. This differed from "Djadochtatherium", which had a narrower V-shaped suture between the frontal and parietal bones.
The intermediate zygomatic ridge on the squamosal bone (also for jaw-muscle attachment) was much smaller and lower than the anterior zygomatic ridge in front of it. "Catopsbaatar" differed from other djadochtatheriids in that the intermediate ridge contacted the anterior ridge with its front edge. The posterior zygomatic ridge at the lower back of the squamosal bone was the weakest of the three ridges, and only marked by a depression. The <a href="postorbital">postorbital</a> processes behind the orbit on the parietal bone were very long, and the parietal ridges extended from the hind margin of the postorbital processes towards each other (but without reaching). The nuchal crest was very prominent, and extended to the sides to form "wings". The <a href="occipital">occipital</a> plate was almost vertical and slightly concave, and was obscured by the nuchal crest when the skull was viewed from above. Though incompletely preserved, it is assumed that the occipital plate sloped back and upwards from the <a href="occipital%20condyles">occipital condyles</a> (as in some relatives). The orbito-temporal <a href="vascular%20system">vascular system</a> inside the skull of "Catopsbaatar" did not differ much from those of related genera.

"Catopsbaatar" <a href="mandible">mandible</a> was robust and very elongated. The <a href="diastema">diastema</a> (gap between the front and cheek teeth) was concave, and extended for 20 percent of the <a href="dentary%20bone">dentary bone</a> (the main bone of the lower jaw). Seen from above, the diastema formed a wide shelf which sloped downwards on the inner side of the jaw. The small <a href="mental%20foramen">mental foramen</a> was close to the upper middle margin of the diastema. The <a href="coronoid%20process%20of%20the%20mandible">coronoid process of the mandible</a> appears to have been relatively longer and narrower than in other djadochtatherioideans. It was separated from the <a href="alveolar%20process">alveolar process</a> (where the teeth are contained) by a wide groove. The <a href="mandibular%20condyle">mandibular condyle</a> (which articulated with the skull) was slightly above the level of the molars. The front part of the masseretic crest was very prominent, forming a bulge known as a masseretic protuberance. The robustness of this crest and the presence of the protuberance varies among related genera. The masseteric <a href="wikt%3Afovea%23Noun">fovea</a> (pit) in front of the masseteric fossa was probably more distinct than in other djadochtatherioids. Each half of the <a href="mandibular%20symphysis">mandibular symphysis</a> (where the two halves of the mandible connect) was shaped like an upside-down teardrop. The <a href="pterygoid%20fossa">pterygoid fossa</a> on the inner side of the mandible was very large, and occupied most of the hind part of the dentary. The lower part of this fossa had a boundary, known as the pterygoideus shelf.

The <a href="dental%20formula">dental formula</a> (the number of teeth of each type in the tooth row of a mammal) of "Catopsbaatar" was (two incisors, no <a href="Canine%20tooth">canines</a>, three premolars and two molars in half of the upper tooth row, and one incisor, no canines, two premolars and two molars in half of the lower). By comparison, the dental formula of humans is . Each tooth in a mammal is designated with a letter and number by position (I for incisor, C for canine, P for premolar, M for molar); the letters are capitalised for the teeth of the upper jaw, but not for those in the lower jaw. The cusp formula shows the arrangement and number of cusps in consecutive rows of a tooth, from the outer to the inner side; each row is separated by a colon.

Being a cimolodont, "Catopsbaatar" did not have I1 incisors. The I2 upper-front incisors of "Catopsbaatar" were very robust and had a sharply limited band of <a href="Tooth%20enamel">enamel</a>. The two incisors converged slightly towards the middle, touching each other. The smaller I3 incisor behind was cone-shaped. The <a href="Dental%20alveolus">alveolus</a> (tooth socket) of "Catopsbaatar"'s I3 incisor was formed by the premaxilla, rather than the premaxilla and maxilla (unlike in "Tombaatar"). The front upper premolars P1 and P3 were only present in juveniles (<a href="Deciduous%20teeth">deciduous</a>), disappearing (with their alveoli) in older individuals. P1 appears to have had two cusps, was single-rooted, and had a cone-like, blunt <a href="Crown%20%28tooth%29">crown</a>. P3 was single-rooted and smaller than P1. The cusp formula of the P4 premolar was 5−4:1, the central cusp being the largest. The P4 of "Catopsbaatar" was almost trapezoidal in shape (unlike in "Djadochtatherium" and "Kryptobaatar", where it is crescent-shaped), smaller, and lacking ridges. "Catopsbaatar" also differed by only having three upper premolars, lacking the P2 (a feature shared with "Tombaatar"). Other mammals usually evolve the loss of teeth at the beginning or end of a tooth row, not in the middle (as in multituberculates). The cusp formula of the M1 molar was 5−6:5−6:4, with the inner ridge extending about 75 percent of the tooth's length. The cusps of M1 were sharp and unworn in juveniles, but worn and concave in older animals. The cusp formula of the M2 molar was 2:2−3:2−3.

"Catopsbaatar" had a single lower pair of incisors, characteristic of multituberculates, which was very strong and compressed sideways. It had a sharply limited band of enamel, and grew continually. The p3 premolar was very small, and adhered entirely to the lower diastema under the larger p4. The blade-like p4 was roughly trapezoidal in side view, and had three cusps along the horizontal upper margin and one cusp on the outer back side. The p4 did not have the ridges on the outer and inner side, as are present in other multituberculates. The m1 molar was almost symmetrical, and its cusp formula was 4:4, the size of the cusps decreasing towards the back. The m2 had a cusp formula of 2−3:2, most specimens being 2:2. The cusps on the inner side were wider than those on the outer side, the inner row of cusps was shorter than the outer one, and the hind margin of the tooth was arranged obliquely.

The only "Catopsbaatar" specimen which preserves the postcranial skeleton is PM120/107, which is fragmentary. It includes elements which are unknown, or incompletely preserved, in other multituberculates. One <a href="lumbar%20vertebra">lumbar vertebra</a> (the fifth or sixth, from between the rib cage and the pelvis) had a spinous process which was stout in side view and long when seen from above. The <a href="clavicle">clavicle</a> was slightly less curved than that of "Kryptobaatar" (resembling a bent rod which widened at each end), and measured about . The upper part of the <a href="scapulocoracoid">scapulocoracoid</a> was relatively wide in side view, and the lower part was very narrow. It was probably about long when complete. The preserved part of the <a href="humerus">humerus</a> (upper arm bone) was about long. Its shaft was triangular in cross-section, relatively narrow when seen from above, and most of its width was occupied by the <a href="intertubercular%20groove">intertubercular groove</a>. This groove was delimited on the side by the crest of the <a href="greater%20tubercle">greater tubercle</a>, whose middle part formed the deltopectoral crest. The ulnar condyle, where the <a href="ulna">ulna</a> of the lower arm articulated with the humerus, was more prominent than the radial condyle (where the radius articulated), oval, and delimited from the radial condyle by a groove. The radius was about long, with a prominent head. Its shaft was smooth, compressed from top to bottom, and oval in cross-section. The ulna was compressed sideways, flatter than the radius, and about long as preserved.
The contact from the <a href="ischium">ischium</a> to the ilium and <a href="pubis%20%28bone%29">pubis</a> of the pelvis was not fused, and the front end of the ischium formed a rugose suture. The pubis was roughly triangular, with a rough suture for the ilium above and a deep groove for the ischium at the lower front. Specimen PM120/107's pelvic bones differed from those of other multituberculates in not being fused together. The presence of sutures in the pelvis of PM120/107 indicates that it was a juvenile, although the skull appears adult; the meaning of this discrepancy is unknown. The femur (thigh bone) was proportionally similar to that of "<a href="Eucosmodon">Eucosmodon</a>" and "Nemegtbaatar"—smaller than the former, but larger than the latter. The femur was stout relative to its length, and it may have been about long. The <a href="tibia">tibia</a> of the lower leg was about long. Seen from behind the upper side, the tibia had a deep excavation (cavity) which may be characteristic of multituberculates.

Unlike most other multituberculates and other mammals, the <a href="calcaneus%20bone">calcaneus bone</a> at the back of the foot had a short tuber calcanei (like some <a href="tree%20kangaroos">tree kangaroos</a>), with an expanded, anvil-shaped proximal process strongly bent downwards and to the side. "Catopsbaatar" had an os calcaris bone on the inner side of its ankle, a feature also seen in modern male <a href="monotremes">monotremes</a> (the <a href="platypus">platypus</a> and the <a href="echidna">echidna</a>) and other Mesozoic mammals. The os calcaris bone was plate-like and rectangular in outline; as in monotremes, it supported the cornu calcaris in forming a <a href="Spur%20%28zoology%29">spur</a> on the outer side of the <a href="Tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsus</a> (cluster of foot bones). Unlike with other Mesozoic mammals, these two elements were not fused together in multituberculates. The cornu calcaris was triangular, with a concavity in the middle, and was long. The spur was flattened, and was thicker at its conjunction with the os calcaris (where they connected via several ridges). As the spur of PM120/107 may have been moved from its original position, it is unknown whether it faced inwards (like in the platypus). Unlike in the platypus, there was no impression of a canal for <a href="venom">venom</a>. The cornu calcaris of "Catopsbaatar" was <a href="ossified">ossified</a> (turned into bone) and would have been covered in <a href="keratin">keratin</a> (the horny covering seen in nails and hoofs). The cornu calcaris of the platypus consists only of keratin, and is hollow.

Hurum, Zhe-Xi Luo, and Kielan-Jaworowska suggested in 2006 that the spurs on the ankles of Mesozoic mammals (such as "Catopsbaatar") were <a href="Homology%20%28biology%29">homologous</a> with those of monotremes, and were a <a href="basal%20%28anatomy%29">basal</a> (or "primitive") feature lost by later therian mammals. The male platypus uses the spur to <a href="Platypus%20venom">deliver venom</a> from a gland, but it is unknown if the extinct groups were venomous as well. Mesozoic mammals were mostly small (with exceptions such as the fox-sized "<a href="Repenomamus">Repenomamus</a>") and, although they were too small to be prey for large <a href="theropod">theropod</a> dinosaurs, smaller theropods, large lizards, crocodiles, and birds could have fed on them. For example, mammal jaws have been found in the abdomen of a specimen of the small theropod "<a href="Sinosauropteryx">Sinosauropteryx</a>"; the jaws belonged to "<a href="Zhangheotherium">Zhangheotherium</a>", which also had spurs, and the multituberculate "<a href="Sinobaatar">Sinobaatar</a>". Since dinosaurs dominated Earth during the Mesozoic, this period has been called the "<a href="Dark%20Ages%20%28historiography%29">dark ages</a>" of mammalian history. The spur, which would have been more effective if venomous, was probably used as a defensive weapon by small, early mammals. It could also have been used during <a href="intraspecific%20competition">intraspecific competition</a> or predation.
The pelvic bones of "Catopsbaatar" specimen PM120/107 may not have been fused because fusion occurred late in development, because it was a <a href="sexually%20dimorphic">sexually dimorphic</a> feature only occurring in males (unfused pelvic bones might have enabled expansion of the <a href="birth%20canal">birth canal</a> in females), or pelvic fusion may be a taxonomic difference between "Catopsbaatar" and other multituberculates. Unlike with other mammals, the pelvis of multituberculates was very narrow; in other genera where the pelvis is known, each half of the pubis and ischium were fused together, forming a keel. The length and rigidity of the keel indicate that the pelvis could not have spread during birth. Because there would be little space for the passage of an egg (egg-laying monotremes have wide ischial archs), Kielan-Jaworowska suggested in 1979 that multituberculates were <a href="viviparous">viviparous</a> (gave live birth) and that the newborns were extremely small—similar to those of marsupials.

Hair, structurally similar to that of modern mammals and associated with bones of the Mongolian multituberculate "<a href="Lambdopsalis">Lambdopsalis</a>", has been identified in <a href="coprolites">coprolites</a> (fossilised feces) of carnivorous mammals from the <a href="Palaeocene%20Epoch">Palaeocene Epoch</a>. This indicates that multituberculates had hair for insulation, similar to modern mammals (and possibly fossil mammals), a feature probably related to <a href="homeothermy">homeothermy</a> (warm-bloodedness).

Although multituberculates were thought to have been carnivores or herbivores, since American palaeontologist <a href="William%20A.%20Clemens">William A. Clemens</a> and Kielan-Jaworowska suggested modern <a href="rat%20kangaroos">rat kangaroos</a> as analogues for the group in 1979 they have been considered <a href="omnivores">omnivores</a> (feeding on both plants and animals). Uniquely among mammals, multituberculates employed a backward chewing stroke which resulted in the <a href="masticatory%20muscles">masticatory muscles</a>—the muscles which move the mandible—being inserted more to the front than in other groups (including rodents). Gambaryan and Kielan-Jaworowska reconstructed the masticatory musculature of various multituberculates in 1995, and found that "Catopsbaatar" and its relatives had very powerful masticatory musculature, due to their high zygomatic arches and large anterior and intermediate zygomatic ridges and coronoid processes. Their powerful incisors, with limited bands of enamel, would have been well adapted to gnawing and to cutting hard seeds (similar to rodents). Since it was larger than some other multituberculates, "Catopsbaatar" would only have to open its mouth 25 degrees to crush hard seeds in diameter; a 40-degree gape would have caused dislocation. After the incisors cut, the premolars and molars would begin to grind with a "power stroke".
According to Gambaryan and Kielan-Jaworowska, the adaptation for crushing hard seeds sometimes—as in "Catopsbaatar"—opposed the benefit of a low condylar process (which discourages mandibular dislocation). The anterior and intermediate zygomatic ridges of the skull were the origin of the superficial <a href="masseter%20muscle">masseter muscle</a>, which facilitates chewing. The separation of the origin of this muscle into two parts and the rounded muscle scars left by them are unique among mammals to multituberculates. The masticatory muscles of multituberculates <a href="independently%20evolved">independently evolved</a> features shared with rodents and small herbivorous marsupials. As with rodents, multituberculates may have been capable of bilateral mastication—where both rows of teeth in the mandible perform the same function simultaneously—and unilateral mastication (where the rows on one side are used).

The limb posture of multituberculates has been debated. According to some researchers, they employed a parasagittal stance with the erect limbs under the body; others consider a sprawling stance more likely. Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum supported the latter theory in 2006 based on the presence of hind-leg spurs, a feature they considered present only in sprawling mammals. They pointed out that all early mammals preserved in <a href="lacustrine">lacustrine</a> (lake) deposits were compressed from top to bottom, suggesting a sprawling stance, whereas later mammals were preserved on their flanks. Earlier arguments for a sprawling stance include deep pelvises and features of the legs. They also suggested that the feet of multituberculates would have been <a href="plantigrade">plantigrade</a> (the sole touching the ground) at rest, but <a href="digitigrade">digitigrade</a> (the sole not touching the ground) when jumping and running quickly; they dismissed the idea that the forelimbs of multituberculates and other early mammals were more parasagittal than their hindlimbs. Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum depicted "Catopsbaatar" with plantigrade, sprawling legs, with mobile spurs which pointed inward when preparing for attack.

In 2008, Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum suggested that the long spinous process on a "Catopsbaatar" vertebra and the long transverse processes in "Nemegtbaatar" may indicate that some multituberculates were saltatorial (had the ability to jump). "Catopsbaatar" probably had strong muscles attaching to the tuber calcanei, which further supports the jumping hypothesis. Although it has been suggested that multituberculates were <a href="arboreal">arboreal</a> (lived in trees), most Asian taxa were probably terrestrial; some others were <a href="fossorial">fossorial</a>, digging and living underground.

All specimens of "Catopsbaatar" are known from the Red Beds of Hermiin Tsav formation, except for one molar from the Barun Goyot Formation. The formations are considered coeval (of the same geological age), contain many of the same animals, and probably date to the late <a href="Campanian">Campanian</a> age of the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> Period (about 72 million years ago). The rock <a href="facies">facies</a> of the Red Beds of Hermiin Tsav formation consist of orange-coloured, thick-bedded <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>, with a thin <a href="interbedding">interbedding</a> of light-coloured <a href="silt%20stones">silt stones</a> and <a href="claystones">claystones</a>. The rock facies of the Barun Goyot Formation are considered to be the result of an arid or semi-arid environment, with <a href="Aeolian%20processes">aeolian</a> (deposited by wind) beds.

Other known mammals from the Red Beds of Hermiin Tsav include the multituberculates "<a href="Nemegtbaatar">Nemegtbaatar</a>", "<a href="Chulsanbaatar">Chulsanbaatar</a>" and "<a href="Nessovbaatar">Nessovbaatar</a>", and the therians "<a href="Deltatheridium">Deltatheridium</a>", "<a href="Asioryctes">Asioryctes</a>", and "<a href="Barunlestes">Barunlestes</a>". Dinosaurs include "<a href="Ajancingenia">Ajancingenia</a>", "<a href="Velociraptor">Velociraptor</a>", "<a href="Saichania">Saichania</a>", "<a href="Platyceratops">Platyceratops</a>", "<a href="Gobiceratops">Gobiceratops</a>", and some indeterminate <a href="Theropoda">theropods</a>.

Perseus (constellation)

Perseus is a <a href="constellation">constellation</a> in the <a href="northern%20sky">northern sky</a>, being named after the <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythological</a> hero <a href="Perseus">Perseus</a>. It is one of the 48 ancient constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>, and among the <a href="88%20modern%20constellations">88 modern constellations</a> defined by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> (IAU). It is located near several other constellations named after ancient Greek legends surrounding Perseus, including <a href="Andromeda%20%28constellation%29">Andromeda</a> to the west and <a href="Cassiopeia%20%28constellation%29">Cassiopeia</a> to the north. Perseus is also bordered by <a href="Aries%20%28constellation%29">Aries</a> and <a href="Taurus%20%28constellation%29">Taurus</a> to the south, <a href="Auriga%20%28constellation%29">Auriga</a> to the east, <a href="Camelopardalis">Camelopardalis</a> to the north, and <a href="Triangulum">Triangulum</a> to the west. Some <a href="Celestial%20cartography">star atlases</a> during the early 19th century also depicted Perseus holding the disembodied head of Medusa, whose <a href="Asterism%20%28astronomy%29">asterism</a> was named together as "Perseus et Caput Medusae", however, this never came into popular usage.

The <a href="galactic%20plane">galactic plane</a> of the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> passes through Perseus, whose brightest star is the yellow-white <a href="supergiant">supergiant</a> <a href="Alpha%20Persei">Alpha Persei</a> (also called Mirfak), which shines at <a href="apparent%20magnitude">magnitude</a> 1.79. It and many of the surrounding stars are members of an <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a> known as the <a href="Alpha%20Persei%20Cluster">Alpha Persei Cluster</a>. The best-known star, however, is <a href="Algol">Algol</a> (Beta Persei), linked with ominous legends because of its <a href="variable%20star">variability</a>, which is noticeable to the naked eye. Rather than being an intrinsically variable star, it is an <a href="eclipsing%20binary">eclipsing binary</a>. Other notable star systems in Perseus include <a href="X%20Persei">X Persei</a>, a binary system containing a <a href="neutron%20star">neutron star</a>, and <a href="GK%20Persei">GK Persei</a>, a <a href="nova">nova</a> that peaked at magnitude 0.2 in 1901. The <a href="Double%20Cluster">Double Cluster</a>, comprising two open clusters quite near each other in the sky, was known to the ancient Chinese. The constellation gives its name to the <a href="Perseus%20cluster">Perseus cluster</a> (Abell 426), a massive galaxy cluster located 250 million <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s from Earth. It hosts the <a href="radiant%20%28meteor%20shower%29">radiant</a> of the annual <a href="Perseids">Perseids</a> <a href="meteor%20shower">meteor shower</a>—one of the most prominent meteor showers in the sky.

The constellation of Perseus may be derived from the Babylonian Old Man (MUL.SHU.GI) constellation, then associated with East in the <a href="MUL.APIN">MUL.APIN</a>an astronomical compilation dating to around 1000 BCE. In Greek mythology, Perseus was the son of <a href="Dana%C3%AB">Danaë</a>, who was sent by King <a href="Polydectes">Polydectes</a> to bring the head of <a href="Medusa">Medusa</a> the <a href="Gorgon">Gorgon</a> — whose visage caused all who gazed upon her to turn to stone. Perseus slew Medusa in her sleep, and <a href="Pegasus">Pegasus</a> and <a href="Chrysaor">Chrysaor</a> appeared from her body. Perseus continued to the realm of <a href="Cepheus%2C%20King%20of%20Aethiopia">Cepheus</a> whose daughter <a href="Andromeda%20%28mythology%29">Andromeda</a> was to be sacrificed to <a href="Cetus%20%28mythology%29">Cetus</a> the sea monster.

Perseus rescued Andromeda from the monster by killing it with his diamond sword. He turned Polydectes and his followers to stone with Medusa's head and appointed <a href="Dictys">Dictys the fisherman</a> king. Perseus and Andromeda married and had six children. In the sky, Perseus lies near the constellations Andromeda, Cepheus, <a href="Cassiopeia%20%28Queen%20of%20Ethiopia%29">Cassiopeia</a> (Andromeda's mother), Cetus, and Pegasus.

Four <a href="Chinese%20constellations">Chinese constellations</a> are contained in the area of the sky identified with Perseus in the West. "Tiānchuán" (天船), the Celestial Boat, was the third paranatellon (A star or constellation which rises at the same time as another star or object) of the third house of the <a href="White%20Tiger%20of%20the%20West">White Tiger of the West</a>, representing the boats that Chinese people were reminded to build in case of a catastrophic flood season. Incorporating stars from the northern part of the constellation, it contained Mu, Delta, Psi, Alpha, Gamma and Eta Persei. "Jīshuǐ" (積水), the Swollen Waters, was the fourth paranatellon of the aforementioned house, representing the potential of unusually high floods during the end of August and beginning of September at the beginning of the flood season. Lambda and possibly Mu Persei lay within it. "Dàlíng" (大陵), the Great Trench, was the fifth paranatellon of that house, representing the trenches where criminals executed en masse in August were interred. It was formed by Kappa, Omega, Rho, 24, 17 and 15 Persei. The pile of corpses prior to their interment was represented by "Jīshī" (積屍, <a href="Pi%20Persei">Pi Persei</a>), the sixth paranatellon of the house. The <a href="Double%20Cluster">Double Cluster</a>, h and Chi Persei, had special significance in <a href="Chinese%20astronomy">Chinese astronomy</a>.

In Polynesia, Perseus was not commonly recognized as a separate constellation; the only people that named it were those of the <a href="Society%20Islands">Society Islands</a>, who called it "Faa-iti", meaning "Little Valley". Algol may have been named "Matohi" by the <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">Māori people</a>, but the evidence for this identification is disputed. "Matohi" ("Split") occasionally came into conflict with "Tangaroa-whakapau" over which of them should appear in the sky, the outcome affecting the tides. It matches the Maori description of a blue-white star near <a href="Aldebaran">Aldebaran</a> but does not disappear as the myth would indicate.

Perseus is bordered by <a href="Aries%20%28constellation%29">Aries</a> and <a href="Taurus%20%28constellation%29">Taurus</a> to the south, <a href="Auriga%20%28constellation%29">Auriga</a> to the east, <a href="Camelopardalis">Camelopardalis</a> and <a href="Cassiopeia%20%28constellation%29">Cassiopeia</a> to the north, and <a href="Andromeda%20%28constellation%29">Andromeda</a> and <a href="Triangulum">Triangulum</a> to the west. Covering 615 <a href="square%20degree">square degree</a>s, it ranks twenty-fourth of the 88 constellations in size. It appears prominently in the northern sky during the Northern Hemisphere's spring. Its main <a href="asterism%20%28astronomy%29">asterism</a> consists of 19 stars. The constellation's boundaries, as set by <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Joseph%20Delporte">Eugène Delporte</a> in 1930, are defined by a 26-sided polygon. In the <a href="equatorial%20coordinate%20system">equatorial coordinate system</a>, the <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the <a href="declination">declination</a> coordinates are between and . The <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> (IAU) adopted the three-letter abbreviation "Per" for the constellation in 1922.

<a href="Algol">Algol</a> (from the Arabic رأس الغول "Ra's al-Ghul", which means "The Demon's Head"), also known by its <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a> Beta Persei, is the best-known star in Perseus. Representing the head of the Gorgon Medusa in Greek mythology, it was called <a href="Horus">Horus</a> in Egyptian mythology and "Rosh ha Satan" ("<a href="Satan">Satan</a>'s Head") in Hebrew. Located 92.8 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s from Earth, it varies in <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> from a minimum of 3.5 to a maximum of 2.3 over a period of 2.867 days.
The star system is the prototype of a group of <a href="Eclipsing%20binary">eclipsing binary stars</a> named <a href="Algol%20variable">Algol variable</a>s, though it has a third member to make up what is actually a <a href="triple%20star">triple star</a> system. The brightest component is a <a href="B-type%20main-sequence%20star">blue-white main-sequence star</a> of <a href="Stellar%20classification">spectral type</a> B8V, which is 3.5 times as massive and 180 times as luminous as the Sun. The secondary component is an orange subgiant star of type K0IV that has begun cooling and expanding to 3.5 times the radius of the Sun, and has 4.5 times the luminosity and 80% of its mass. These two are separated by only 0.05 <a href="astronomical%20unit">astronomical unit</a>s (AU)—five percent of the distance between the Earth and Sun; the main dip in brightness arises when the larger fainter companion passes in front of the hotter brighter primary. The tertiary component is a main sequence star of type A7, which is located on average 2.69 AU from the other two stars. <a href="AG%20Persei">AG Persei</a> is another Algol variable in Perseus, whose primary component is a B-type main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of 6.69. <a href="Phi%20Persei">Phi Persei</a> is a double star, although the two components do not eclipse each other. The primary star is a <a href="Be%20star">Be star</a> of spectral type B0.5, possibly a giant star, and the secondary companion is likely a stellar remnant. The secondary has a similar spectral type to O-type <a href="subdwarf">subdwarf</a>s.

With the historical name Mirfak (Arabic for "elbow") or Algenib, <a href="Alpha%20Persei">Alpha Persei</a> is the brightest star of this constellation with an apparent magnitude of 1.79. A <a href="supergiant">supergiant</a> of spectral type F5Ib located around 590 light-years away from Earth, Mirfak has 5,000 times the <a href="luminosity">luminosity</a> and 42 times the diameter of our Sun. It is the brightest member of the <a href="Alpha%20Persei%20Cluster">Alpha Persei Cluster</a> (also known as "<a href="Melotte%20Catalogue">Melotte</a> 20" and "<a href="Collinder%20catalog">Collinder</a> 39"), which is an <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a> containing many luminous stars. Neighboring bright stars that are members include the Be stars <a href="Delta%20Persei">Delta</a> (magnitude 3.0), <a href="Psi%20Persei">Psi</a> (4.3), and <a href="48%20Persei">48 Persei</a> (4.0); the <a href="Beta%20Cephei%20variable">Beta Cephei variable</a> <a href="Epsilon%20Persei">Epsilon Persei</a> (2.9); and the stars <a href="29%20Persei">29</a> (5.2), <a href="30%20Persei">30</a> (5.5), <a href="31%20Persei">31</a> (5.0), and <a href="34%20Persei">34 Persei</a> (4.7). Of magnitude 4.05, nearby <a href="Iota%20Persei">Iota Persei</a> has been considered a member of the group, but is actually located a mere 34 light-years distant. This star is very similar to our Sun, shining with 2.2 times its luminosity. It is a yellow main sequence star of spectral type G0V. Extensive searches have failed to find evidence of it having a planetary system.

<a href="Zeta%20Persei">Zeta Persei</a> is the third-brightest star in the constellation at magnitude 2.86. Around 750 light-years from Earth, it is a blue-white supergiant 26–27 times the radius of the Sun and 47,000 times its luminosity. It is the brightest star (as seen from Earth) of a <a href="moving%20group">moving group</a> of bright blue-white giant and supergiant stars, the Perseus OB2 Association or Zeta Persei Association. Zeta is a triple star system, with a companion blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B8 and apparent magnitude 9.16 around 3900 AU distant from the primary, and a white main sequence star of magnitude 9.90 and spectral type A2, some 50,000 AU away, that may or may not be gravitationally bound to the other two. <a href="X%20Persei">X Persei</a> is a double system in this association; one component is a hot, bright star and the other is a <a href="neutron%20star">neutron star</a>. With an apparent magnitude of 6.72, it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye even in perfectly dark conditions. The system is an <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> source and the primary star appears to be undergoing substantial mass loss. Once thought to be a member of the Perseus OB2 Association, <a href="Omicron%20Persei">Omicron Persei</a> (Atik) is a multiple star system with a combined visual magnitude of 3.85. It is composed of two blue-white starsa giant of spectral class B1.5 and main sequence star of B3which orbit each other every 4.5 days and are distorted into ovoids due to their small separation. The system has a third star about which little is known. At an estimated distance of 1475 light-years from Earth, the system is now thought to lie too far from the center of the Zeta Persei group to belong to it.

<a href="GRO%20J0422%2B32">GRO J0422+32</a> (V518 Persei) is another X-ray binary in Perseus. One component is a <a href="red%20dwarf">red dwarf</a> star of spectral type M4.5V, which orbits a mysterious dense and heavy object—possibly a <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a>—every 5.1 hours. The system is an X-ray nova, meaning that it experiences periodic outbursts in the X-ray band of the <a href="electromagnetic%20spectrum">electromagnetic spectrum</a>. If the system does indeed contain a black hole, it would be the smallest one ever recorded. Further analysis in 2012 calculated a mass of 2.1 solar masses, which raises questions as to what the object actually is as it appears to be too small to be a black hole.

<a href="GK%20Persei">GK Persei</a>, also known as Nova Persei 1901, is a bright nova that appeared halfway between Algol and Delta Persei. Discovered on 21 February 1901 by Scottish amateur astronomer <a href="Thomas%20David%20Anderson">Thomas David Anderson</a>, it peaked at magnitude 0.2almost as bright as <a href="Capella">Capella</a> and <a href="Vega">Vega</a>. It faded to <a href="Apparent%20magnitude%23Table%20of%20notable%20celestial%20objects">magnitude 13</a> around 30 years after its peak brightness. <a href="Xi%20Persei">Xi Persei</a>, traditionally known as Menkhib, a blue giant of spectral type O7III, is one of the hottest bright stars in the sky, with a surface temperature of 37,500 K. It is one of the more massive stars, being between 26 and 32 solar masses, and is 330,000 times as luminous as our Sun.

Named Gorgonea Tertia, <a href="Rho%20Persei">Rho Persei</a> varies in brightness like Algol, but is a pulsating rather than eclipsing star. At an advanced stage of stellar evolution, it is a red giant that has expanded for the second time to have a radius around 150 times that of our Sun. Its helium has been fused into heavier elements and its core is composed of carbon and oxygen. It is a <a href="semiregular%20variable%20star">semiregular variable star</a> of the <a href="Mu%20Cephei">Mu Cephei</a> type, whose <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> varies between 3.3 and 4.0 with periods of 50, 120 and 250 days. The Double Cluster contains three even larger stars, each over 700 <a href="solar%20radius">solar radii</a>: <a href="S%20Persei">S</a>, <a href="RS%20Persei">RS</a>, and <a href="SU%20Persei">SU Persei</a> are all semiregular pulsating <a href="Red%20supergiant">M-type supergiants</a>. The stars are not visible to the naked eye; SU Persei, the brightest of the three, has an apparent magnitude of 7.9 and thus is visible through binoculars. <a href="AX%20Persei">AX Persei</a> is another binary star, the primary component is a <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a> in an advanced phase of <a href="stellar%20evolution">stellar evolution</a>, which is transferring material onto an <a href="accretion%20disc">accretion disc</a> around a smaller star. The star system is one of the few eclipsing <a href="symbiotic%20binary">symbiotic binaries</a>, but is unusual because the secondary star is not a white dwarf, but an <a href="A-type%20star">A-type star</a>. <a href="DY%20Persei">DY Persei</a> is a variable star that is the prototype of <a href="DY%20Persei%20variable">DY Persei variable</a>s, which are carbon-rich <a href="R%20Coronae%20Borealis%20variable">R Coronae Borealis variable</a>s that exhibit the variability of <a href="asymptotic%20giant%20branch">asymptotic giant branch</a> stars. DY Persei itself is a <a href="carbon%20star">carbon star</a> that is too dim to see through binoculars, with an apparent magnitude of 10.6.

Seven stars in Perseus have been found to have planetary systems. <a href="V718%20Persei">V718 Persei</a> is a star in the young open cluster <a href="IC%20348">IC 348</a> that appears to be periodically eclipsed by a giant planet every 4.7 years. This has been inferred to be an object with a maximum mass of 6 times that of <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> and an orbital radius of 3.3 AU.

The <a href="galactic%20plane">galactic plane</a> of the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> passes through Perseus, but is much less obvious than elsewhere in the sky as it is mostly obscured by <a href="molecular%20cloud">molecular cloud</a>s. The <a href="Perseus%20Arm">Perseus Arm</a> is a spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy and stretches across the sky from the constellation <a href="Cassiopeia%20%28constellation%29">Cassiopeia</a> through Perseus and <a href="Auriga%20%28constellation%29">Auriga</a> to <a href="Gemini%20%28constellation%29">Gemini</a> and <a href="Monoceros">Monoceros</a>. This segment is towards the rim of the galaxy.

Within the Perseus Arm lie two open clusters (<a href="NGC%20869">NGC 869</a> and <a href="NGC%20884">NGC 884</a>) known as the Double Cluster. Sometimes known as h and Chi (χ) Persei respectively, they are easily visible through binoculars and small telescopes. Both lie more than 7,000 light-years from Earth and are several hundred light-years apart. Both clusters are of approximately magnitude 4 and 0.5 degrees in diameter. The two are <a href="Trumpler%20class">Trumpler class</a> I 3 r clusters, though NGC 869 is a <a href="Shapley%E2%80%93Sawyer%20Concentration%20Class">Shapley class</a> f and NGC 884 is a Shapley class e cluster. These classifications indicate that they are both quite rich (dense); NGC 869 is the richer of the pair. The clusters are both distinct from the surrounding star field and are clearly concentrated at their centers. The constituent stars, numbering over 100 in each cluster, range widely in brightness.

<a href="Messier%2034">M34</a> is an open cluster that appears at magnitude 5.5, and is approximately 1,500 light-years from Earth. It contains about 100 stars scattered over a field of view larger than that of the full moon. M34 can be resolved with good eyesight but is best viewed using a telescope at low magnifications. IC 348 is a somewhat young open cluster that is still contained within the nebula from which its stars formed. It is located about 1,027 light-years from Earth, is about 2 million years old, and contains many stars with <a href="circumstellar%20disk">circumstellar disk</a>s. Many <a href="brown%20dwarf">brown dwarf</a>s have been discovered in this cluster due to its age; since brown dwarfs cool as they age, it is easier to find them in younger clusters.

There are many nebulae in Perseus. <a href="Little%20Dumbbell%20Nebula">M76</a> is a <a href="planetary%20nebula">planetary nebula</a>, also called the Little Dumbbell Nebula. It appears two <a href="arc-minute">arc-minute</a>s by one arc-minute across and has an apparent brightness of magnitude 10.1. <a href="California%20Nebula">NGC 1499</a>, also known as the California Nebula, is an <a href="emission%20nebula">emission nebula</a> that was discovered in 1884–85 by American astronomer <a href="Edward%20Emerson%20Barnard">Edward E. Barnard</a>. It is very difficult to observe visually because its low surface brightness makes it appear dimmer than most other emission nebulae. <a href="NGC%201333">NGC 1333</a> is a <a href="reflection%20nebula">reflection nebula</a> and a <a href="star-forming%20region">star-forming region</a>. Perseus also contains a <a href="giant%20molecular%20cloud">giant molecular cloud</a>, called the <a href="Perseus%20molecular%20cloud">Perseus molecular cloud</a>; it belongs to the <a href="Orion%20Arm">Orion Spur</a> and is known for its low rate of star formation compared to similar clouds.

Perseus contains some notable galaxies. <a href="NGC%201023">NGC 1023</a> is a <a href="barred%20spiral%20galaxy">barred spiral galaxy</a> of magnitude 10.35, around 11.6 million pc (38 million ly) from Earth. It is the principal member of the <a href="NGC%201023%20group">NGC 1023 group</a> of galaxies and is possibly interacting with another galaxy. <a href="NGC%201260">NGC 1260</a> is either a <a href="Lenticular%20galaxy">lenticular</a> or tightly-wound <a href="spiral%20galaxy">spiral galaxy</a> about 76.7 million pc (250 million ly) from Earth. It was the host galaxy of the supernova <a href="SN%202006gy">SN 2006gy</a>, one of the brightest ever recorded. It is a member of the <a href="Perseus%20cluster">Perseus cluster</a> (Abell 426), a massive <a href="galaxy%20cluster">galaxy cluster</a> located 76.6 million pc (250 million ly) from Earth. With a <a href="redshift">redshift</a> of 0.0179, Abell 426 is the closest major cluster to the Earth. <a href="NGC%201275">NGC 1275</a>, a component of the cluster, is a <a href="Seyfert%20galaxy">Seyfert galaxy</a> containing an <a href="active%20galactic%20nucleus">active nucleus</a> that produces jets of material, surrounding the galaxy with massive bubbles. These bubbles create sound waves that travel through the Perseus Cluster, sounding a <a href="B%E2%99%AD%20%28musical%20note%29">B flat</a> 57 <a href="octave">octave</a>s below <a href="middle%20C">middle C</a>. This galaxy is a <a href="cD%20galaxy">cD galaxy</a> that has undergone many <a href="galactic%20merger">galactic merger</a>s throughout its existence, as evidenced by the "high velocity system"the remnants of a smaller galaxysurrounding it. Its active nucleus is a strong source of radio waves.

The <a href="Perseids">Perseids</a> are a prominent annual <a href="meteor%20shower">meteor shower</a> that appear to radiate from Perseus from mid-July, peaking in activity between 9 and 14 August each year. Associated with <a href="Comet%20Swift%E2%80%93Tuttle">Comet Swift–Tuttle</a>, they have been observed for about 2,000 years. The September Epsilon Perseids, discovered in 2012, are a meteor shower with an unknown parent body in the <a href="Oort%20cloud">Oort cloud</a>.

Auriga (constellation)

Auriga is one of the <a href="List%20of%20constellations">88 modern constellations</a>; it was among the 48 <a href="constellation">constellation</a>s listed by the 2nd-century astronomer <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>. Located north of the <a href="celestial%20equator">celestial equator</a>, its name is the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word for “the charioteer”, associating it with various mythological beings, including <a href="Erichthonius%20of%20Athens">Erichthonius</a> and <a href="Myrtilus">Myrtilus</a>. Auriga is most prominent during winter evenings in the <a href="northern%20Hemisphere">northern Hemisphere</a>, along with the five other constellations that have stars in the <a href="Winter%20Hexagon">Winter Hexagon</a> <a href="asterism%20%28astronomy%29">asterism</a>. Because of its northern <a href="declination">declination</a>, Auriga is only visible in its entirety as far as 34° south; for observers farther south it lies partially or fully below the horizon. A large constellation, with an area of 657 square degrees, it is half the size of the largest constellation, <a href="Hydra%20%28constellation%29">Hydra</a>.

Its brightest star, <a href="Capella%20%28star%29">Capella</a>, is an unusual <a href="Star%20system">multiple star system</a> among the brightest stars in the night sky. <a href="Beta%20Aurigae">Beta Aurigae</a> is an interesting <a href="variable%20star">variable star</a> in the constellation; <a href="Epsilon%20Aurigae">Epsilon Aurigae</a>, a nearby eclipsing binary with an unusually long period, has been studied intensively. Because of its position near the winter <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>, Auriga has many bright <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a>s in its borders, including <a href="Messier%2036">M36</a>, <a href="Messier%2037">M37</a>, and <a href="Messier%2038">M38</a>, popular targets for amateur astronomers. In addition, it has one prominent <a href="nebula">nebula</a>, the <a href="Flaming%20Star%20Nebula">Flaming Star Nebula</a>, associated with the variable star <a href="AE%20Aurigae">AE Aurigae</a>.

In Chinese mythology, Auriga's stars were incorporated into several constellations, including the celestial emperors' chariots, made up of the modern constellation's brightest stars. Auriga is home to the <a href="radiant%20%28meteor%20shower%29">radiant</a> for the <a href="Aurigids">Aurigids</a>, <a href="Zeta%20Aurigids">Zeta Aurigids</a>, <a href="Delta%20Aurigids">Delta Aurigids</a>, and the hypothesized <a href="Iota%20Aurigids">Iota Aurigids</a>.

The first record of Auriga's stars was in <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> as a constellation called GAM, representing a <a href="scimitar">scimitar</a> or crook. However, this may have represented just Capella (Alpha Aurigae) or the modern constellation as a whole; this figure was alternatively called Gamlum or MUL.GAM in the <a href="MUL.APIN">MUL.APIN</a>. The crook of Auriga stood for a goat-herd or shepherd. It was formed from most of the stars of the modern constellation; all of the bright stars were included except for <a href="Beta%20Tauri">Elnath</a>, traditionally assigned to both Taurus and Auriga. Later, <a href="Bedouin">Bedouin</a> astronomers created constellations that were groups of animals, where each star represented one animal. The stars of Auriga comprised a herd of goats, an association also present in Greek mythology. The association with goats carried into the Greek astronomical tradition, though it later became associated with a charioteer along with the shepherd.

In <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, Auriga is often identified as the mythological Greek hero <a href="Erichthonius%20of%20Athens">Erichthonius of Athens</a>, the <a href="chthonic">chthonic</a> son of <a href="Hephaestus">Hephaestus</a> who was raised by the goddess <a href="Athena">Athena</a>. Erichthonius was generally credited to be the inventor of the <a href="quadriga">quadriga</a>, the four-horse chariot, which he used in the battle against the usurper <a href="Amphictyon">Amphictyon</a>, the event that made Erichthonius the king of <a href="Athens">Athens</a>. His chariot was created in the image of the Sun's chariot, the reason Zeus placed him in the heavens. The Athenian hero then dedicated himself to Athena and, soon after, Zeus raised him into the night sky in honor of his ingenuity and heroic deeds.
Auriga, however, is sometimes described as <a href="Myrtilus">Myrtilus</a>, who was <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a>'s son and the charioteer of <a href="Oenomaus">Oenomaus</a>. The association of Auriga and Myrtilus is supported by depictions of the constellation, which rarely show a chariot. Myrtilus's chariot was destroyed in a race intended for suitors to win the heart of Oenomaus's daughter <a href="Hippodamia">Hippodamia</a>. Myrtilus earned his position in the sky when Hippodamia's successful suitor, <a href="Pelops">Pelops</a>, killed him, despite his complicity in helping Pelops win her hand. After his death, Myrtilus's father Hermes placed him in the sky. Yet another mythological association of Auriga is <a href="Theseus">Theseus</a>'s son <a href="Hippolytus%20%28mythology%29">Hippolytus</a>. He was ejected from Athens after he refused the romantic advances of his stepmother <a href="Phaedra%20%28mythology%29">Phaedra</a>, who committed suicide as a result. He was killed when his chariot was wrecked, but revived by <a href="Asclepius">Asclepius</a>. Regardless of Auriga's specific representation, it is likely that the constellation was created by the ancient Greeks to commemorate the importance of the chariot in their society.

An incidental appearance of Auriga in Greek mythology is as the limbs of <a href="Medea">Medea</a>'s brother. In the myth of <a href="Jason">Jason</a> and the <a href="Argonauts">Argonauts</a>, as they journeyed home, Medea killed her brother and dismembered him, flinging the parts of his body into the sea, represented by the Milky Way. Each individual star represents a different limb.

<a href="Capella%20%28star%29">Capella</a> is associated with the mythological she-goat <a href="Amalthea%20%28mythology%29">Amalthea</a>, who breast-fed the infant Zeus. It forms an <a href="Asterism%20%28astronomy%29">asterism</a> with the stars <a href="Epsilon%20Aurigae">Epsilon Aurigae</a>, <a href="Zeta%20Aurigae">Zeta Aurigae</a>, and <a href="Eta%20Aurigae">Eta Aurigae</a>, the latter two of which are known as the "Haedi" (the <a href="Goat">Kids</a>). Though most often associated with Amalthea, Capella has sometimes been associated with Amalthea's owner, a <a href="nymph">nymph</a>. The myth of the nymph says that the goat's hideous appearance, resembling a Gorgon, was partially responsible for the <a href="Titan%20%28mythology%29">Titans</a>' defeat, because Zeus skinned the goat and wore it as his <a href="aegis">aegis</a>. The asterism containing the three goats had been a separate constellation; however, <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> merged the Charioteer and the Goats in the 2nd-century <a href="Almagest">Almagest</a>. Before that, Capella was sometimes seen as its own constellation—by <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> and <a href="Marcus%20Manilius">Manilius</a>—called "Capra", "Caper", or "Hircus", all of which relate to its status as the "goat star". Zeta Aurigae and Eta Aurigae were first called the "Kids" by <a href="Cleostratus">Cleostratus</a>, an ancient Greek astronomer.
Traditionally, illustrations of Auriga represent it as a chariot and its driver. The charioteer holds a goat over his left shoulder and has two <a href="Goat%23Reproduction">kids</a> under his left arm; he holds the reins to the chariot in his right hand. However, depictions of Auriga have been inconsistent over the years. The reins in his right hand have also been drawn as a whip, though Capella is almost always over his left shoulder and the Kids under his left arm. The 1488 atlas "<a href="Hyginus">Hyginus</a>" deviated from this typical depiction by showing a four-wheeled cart driven by Auriga, who holds the reins of two oxen, a horse, and a zebra. <a href="Jacob%20Micyllus">Jacob Micyllus</a> depicted Auriga in his "Hyginus" of 1535 as a charioteer with a two-wheeled cart, powered by two horses and two oxen. Arabic and Turkish depictions of Auriga varied wildly from those of the European Renaissance; one Turkish atlas depicted the stars of Auriga as a <a href="mule">mule</a>, called "Mulus clitellatus" by <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a>. One unusual representation of Auriga, from 17th-century France, showed Auriga as <a href="Adam">Adam</a> kneeling on the Milky Way, with a goat wrapped around his shoulders.

Occasionally, Auriga is seen not as the Charioteer but as <a href="Bellerophon">Bellerophon</a>, the mortal rider of <a href="Pegasus">Pegasus</a> who dared to approach <a href="Mount%20Olympus">Mount Olympus</a>. In this version of the tale, <a href="Jupiter%20%28mythology%29">Jupiter</a> pitied Bellerophon for his foolishness and placed him in the stars.

Some of the stars of Auriga were incorporated into a <a href="former%20constellations">now-defunct constellation</a> called <a href="Telescopium%20Herschelii">Telescopium Herschelii</a>. This constellation was introduced by <a href="Maximilian%20Hell">Maximilian Hell</a> to honor <a href="William%20Herschel">William Herschel</a>'s discovery of <a href="Uranus">Uranus</a>. Originally, it included two constellations, Tubus Hershelii Major ', in <a href="Gemini%20%28constellation%29">Gemini</a>, <a href="Lynx%20%28constellation%29">Lynx</a>, and Auriga, and Tubus Hershelii Minor ' in <a href="Orion%20%28constellation%29">Orion</a> and <a href="Taurus%20%28constellation%29">Taurus</a>; both represented Herschel's telescopes. <a href="Johann%20Bode">Johann Bode</a> combined Hell's constellations into Telescopium Herschelii in 1801, located mostly in Auriga.

Since the time of Ptolemy, Auriga has remained a constellation and is officially recognized by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a>, although like all modern constellations, it is now defined as a specific region of the sky that includes both the ancient pattern and the surrounding stars. In 1922, the IAU designated its recommended three-letter abbreviation, "Aur". The official boundaries of Auriga were created in 1930 by <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Delporte">Eugène Delporte</a> as a polygon of 21 segments. Its <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> is between 4 37.5 and 7 30.5 and its <a href="declination">declination</a> is between 27.9° and 56.2° in the <a href="equatorial%20coordinate%20system">equatorial coordinate system</a>.

The stars of Auriga were incorporated into several Chinese constellations. "Wuche", the five chariots of the celestial emperors and the representation of the grain harvest, was a constellation formed by Alpha Aurigae, Beta Aurigae, Beta Tauri, Theta Aurigae, and Iota Aurigae. "Sanzhu" or "Zhu" was one of three constellations which represented poles for horses to be tethered. They were formed by the triplets of Epsilon, Zeta, and Eta Aurigae; Nu, Tau, and Upsilon Aurigae; and Chi and 26 Aurigae, with one other undetermined star. "Xianchi", the pond where the sun set and "Tianhuang", a pond, bridge, or pier, were other constellations in Auriga, though the stars that composed them are undetermined. "Zuoqi", representing chairs for the emperor and other officials, was made up of nine stars in the east of the constellation. "Bagu", a constellation mostly formed from stars in <a href="Camelopardalis">Camelopardalis</a> representing different types of crops, included the northern stars of Delta and Xi Aurigae.

In ancient <a href="Hindu%20astronomy">Hindu astronomy</a>, Capella represented the heart of <a href="Brahma">Brahma</a> and was important religiously. Ancient Peruvian peoples saw Capella, called "Colca", as a star intimately connected to the affairs of shepherds.

In Brazil, the <a href="Bororo%20%28Brazil%29">Bororo people</a> incorporate the stars of Auriga into a massive constellation representing a <a href="caiman">caiman</a>; its southern stars represent the end of the animal's tail. The eastern portion of <a href="Taurus%20%28constellation%29">Taurus</a> is the rest of the tail, while <a href="Orion%20%28constellation%29">Orion</a> is its body and <a href="Lepus%20%28constellation%29">Lepus</a> is the head. This constellation arose because of the prominence of caymans in daily Amazonian life. There is evidence that Capella was significant to the <a href="Aztec%20people">Aztec people</a>, as the <a href="Mesoamerica%23Late%20Classic">Late Classic</a> site <a href="Monte%20Alb%C3%A1n">Monte Albán</a> has a marker for the star's <a href="heliacal%20rising">heliacal rising</a>. <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Indigenous peoples</a> of <a href="California">California</a> and <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a> also noticed the bright pattern of Auriga's stars. To them, the constellation's bright stars formed a curve that was represented in crescent-shaped <a href="petroglyph">petroglyph</a>s. The indigenous <a href="Pawnee%20people">Pawnee</a> of North America recognized a constellation with the same major stars as modern Auriga: Alpha, Beta, Gamma (Beta Tauri), Theta, and Iota Aurigae.

The people of the <a href="Marshall%20Islands">Marshall Islands</a> featured Auriga in the myth of <a href="D%C3%BCmur">Dümur</a>, which tells the story of the creation of the sky. <a href="Antares">Antares</a> in <a href="Scorpius%20%28constellation%29">Scorpius</a> represents Dümur, the oldest son of the stars' mother, and the <a href="Pleiades">Pleiades</a> represent her youngest son. The mother of the stars, <a href="Ligedaner">Ligedaner</a>, is represented by Capella; she lived on the island of <a href="Alinablab">Alinablab</a>. She told her sons that the first to reach an eastern island would become the King of the Stars, and asked Dümur to let her come in his canoe. He refused, as did each of her sons in turn, except for Pleiades. Pleiades won the race with the help of Ligedaner, and became the King of the Stars. Elsewhere in the central <a href="Caroline%20Islands">Caroline Islands</a>, Capella was called "Jefegen uun" (variations include "efang alul", "evang-el-ul", and "iefangel uul"), meaning "north of Aldebaran". Different names were noted for Auriga and Capella in Eastern Pacific societies. On <a href="Pukapuka">Pukapuka</a>, the figure of modern Auriga was called "Te Wale-o-Tutakaiolo" ("The house of Tutakaiolo"); in the <a href="Society%20Islands">Society Islands</a>, it was called "Faa-nui" ("Great Valley"). Capella itself was called "Tahi-anii" ("Unique Sovereign") in the Societies. "Hoku-lei" was the name for Capella but may have been the name for the whole constellation; the name means "Star-wreath" and refers to one of the wives of the Pleiades, called "Makalii".

The stars of Auriga feature in <a href="Inuit%20astronomy">Inuit constellations</a>. <a href="Quturjuuk">Quturjuuk</a>, meaning "collar-bones", was a constellation that included Capella (Alpha Aurigae), Menkalinan (Beta Aurigae), <a href="Pollux%20%28star%29">Pollux</a> (Beta Geminorum), and <a href="Castor%20%28star%29">Castor</a> (Alpha Geminorum). Its rising signalled that the constellation <a href="Aagjuuk">Aagjuuk</a>, made up of <a href="Altair">Altair</a> (Alpha Aquilae), <a href="Tarazed">Tarazed</a> (Gamma Aquilae), and sometimes <a href="Alshain">Alshain</a> (Beta Aquilae), would rise soon. Aagjuuk, which represented the dawn following the winter solstice, was an incredibly important constellation in the Inuit mythos. It was also used for navigation and time-keeping at night.

<a href="Capella%20%28star%29">Alpha Aurigae</a> (Capella), the brightest star in Auriga, is a <a href="G-type%20star">G8III class star</a> (G-type <a href="giant%20star">giant</a>) 43 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s away and the sixth-brightest star in the night sky at magnitude 0.08. Its traditional name is a reference to its mythological position as Amalthea; it is sometimes called the "Goat Star". Capella's names all point to this mythology. In Arabic, Capella was called "al-'Ayyuq", meaning "the goat", and in Sumerian, it was called mul.ÁŠ.KAR, "the goat star". On <a href="Ontong%20Java">Ontong Java</a>, Capella was called "ngahalapolu". Capella is a <a href="spectroscopic%20binary">spectroscopic binary</a> with a period of 104 days; the components are both <a href="yellow%20giant">yellow giant</a>s, more specifically, the primary is a G-type star and the secondary is between a G-type and F-type star in its evolution. The secondary is formally classified as a G0III class star (G-type giant). The primary has a radius of 11.87 <a href="solar%20radii">solar radii</a> () and a mass of 2.47 <a href="solar%20mass">solar mass</a>es (); the secondary has a radius of and a mass of . The two components are separated by 110 million kilometers, almost 75% of the distance between the Earth and the Sun. The star's status as a binary was discovered in 1899 at the <a href="Lick%20Observatory">Lick Observatory</a>; its period was determined in 1919 by <a href="John%20August%20Anderson">J.A. Anderson</a> at the 100-inch <a href="Mt.%20Wilson%20Observatory">Mt. Wilson Observatory</a> telescope. It appears with a golden-yellow hue, though Ptolemy and <a href="Giovanni%20Battista%20Riccioli">Giovanni Battista Riccioli</a> both described its color as red, a phenomenon attributed not to a change in Capella's color but to the idiosyncrasies of their color sensitivities. Capella has an <a href="absolute%20magnitude">absolute magnitude</a> of 0.3 and a <a href="luminosity">luminosity</a> of 160 times the <a href="solar%20luminosity">luminosity of the Sun</a>, or (the primary is and the secondary is ). It may be loosely associated with the <a href="Hyades%20%28star%20cluster%29">Hyades</a>, an <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a> in <a href="Taurus%20%28constellation%29">Taurus</a>, because of their similar <a href="proper%20motion">proper motion</a>. Capella has one more companion, Capella H, which is a pair of <a href="red%20dwarf">red dwarf</a> stars located 11,000 <a href="astronomical%20unit">astronomical unit</a>s (0.17 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s) from the main pair.

<a href="Beta%20Aurigae">Beta Aurigae</a> (Menkalinan, Menkarlina) is a bright <a href="A-type%20star">A2IV class star</a> (A-type <a href="subgiant">subgiant</a>). Its Arabic name comes from the phrase "mankib dhu al-'inan", meaning "shoulder of the charioteer" and is a reference to Beta Aurigae's location in the constellation. Menkalinan is 81 light-years away and has a magnitude of 1.90. Like Epsilon Aurigae, it is an <a href="eclipsing%20binary">eclipsing binary</a> star that varies in magnitude by 0.1. The two components are blue-white stars that have a period of 3.96 days. Its double nature was revealed <a href="spectroscopy">spectroscopically</a> in 1890 by <a href="Antonia%20Maury">Antonia Maury</a>, making it the second spectroscopic binary discovered, and its variable nature was discovered <a href="photometry%20%28astronomy%29">photometrically</a> 20 years later by <a href="Joel%20Stebbins">Joel Stebbins</a>. Menkalinan has an absolute magnitude of 0.6 and a luminosity of . The component of its motion in the direction of Earth is per second. Beta Aurigae may be associated with a stream of about 70 stars including <a href="Delta%20Leonis">Delta Leonis</a> and <a href="Alpha%20Ophiuchi">Alpha Ophiuchi</a>; the <a href="proper%20motion">proper motion</a> of this group is comparable to that of the <a href="Ursa%20Major%20Moving%20Group">Ursa Major Moving Group</a>, though the connection is only hypothesized. Besides its close eclipsing companion, Menkalinan has two other stars associated with it. One is an unrelated <a href="optical%20binary">optical companion</a>, discovered in 1783 by <a href="William%20Herschel">William Herschel</a>; it has a magnitude of 10.5 and has a separation of 184 <a href="arcsecond">arcsecond</a>s. The other is likely associated gravitationally with the primary, as determined by their <a href="common%20proper%20motion">common proper motion</a>. This 14th-magnitude star was discovered in 1901 by <a href="Edward%20Emerson%20Barnard">Edward Emerson Barnard</a>.

It evolved from a B-type star to a K-type star over the estimated 30–45 million years since its birth. Iota Aurigae has an absolute magnitude of −2.3 and a luminosity of . It is classed as a particularly luminous <a href="bright%20giant">bright giant</a>, but appears dimmer than it should because dust clouds in the Milky Way block some of its light; astronomers estimate that it appears 0.6 magnitudes fainter. It is also a <a href="hybrid%20star">hybrid star</a>, an <a href="x-ray">x-ray</a> producing giant star that emits x-rays from its <a href="corona">corona</a> and has a cool <a href="stellar%20wind">stellar wind</a>. Though its proper motion is just 0.02 arcseconds per year, it has a radial velocity of per second in recession. The traditional name Kabdhilinan, sometimes shortened to "Alkab", comes from the Arabic phrase "al-kab dh'il inan", meaning "shoulder of the rein holder". Iota Aurigae may end as a <a href="supernova">supernova</a>, but because it is close to the mass limit for such stars, it may instead become a <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a>.

<a href="Delta%20Aurigae">Delta Aurigae</a>, the northernmost bright star in Auriga, is a K0III-type star (K-type giant), 126 light-years from Earth and approximately 1.3 billion years old. It has a magnitude of 3.72, an absolute magnitude of 0.2, and a luminosity of . About 12 times the radius of the Sun, Delta Aurigae weighs only two solar masses and rotates with a period of almost one year. Though it is often listed as a single star, it actually has three very widely spaced optical companions. One is a double star of magnitude 11, two arcminutes from Delta, and the other is a star of magnitude 10, three arcminutes from Delta.

<a href="Lambda%20Aurigae">Lambda Aurigae</a> (Al Hurr) is a G1.5IV-V-type star (G-type star intermediate between a subgiant and <a href="main-sequence%20star">main-sequence star</a>) of magnitude 4.71. It has an absolute magnitude of 4.4 and is located 41 light-years from Earth. It has very weak emissions in the <a href="infrared">infrared</a> spectrum, like Epsilon Aurigae. In <a href="photometry%20%28astronomy%29">photometric</a> observations of Epsilon, an unusual variable, Lambda Aurigae is commonly used as a comparison star. It is reaching the end of its <a href="hydrogen%20fusion">hydrogen-fusing</a> <a href="stellar%20evolution">lifespan</a> at an age of 6.2 billion years. It also has an unusually high <a href="radial%20velocity">radial velocity</a> at 83 km/second.

Nu Aurigae is a giant star with a radius of 20–21 solar radii and a mass of approximately 3 solar masses. It may technically be a binary star; its companion, sometimes listed as optical and separated by 56 arcseconds, is a dwarf star of spectral type K6 and magnitude 11.4. Its period is more than 120,000 years and it orbits at least 3,700 AU from the primary.

The most prominent variable star in Auriga is <a href="Epsilon%20Aurigae">Epsilon Aurigae</a> (Al Maz, Almaaz), an <a href="F-type%20star">F0 class</a> <a href="eclipsing%20binary%20star">eclipsing binary star</a> with an unusually long period of 27 years; its last minima occurred in 1982–1984 and 2009–2011. The distance to the system is disputed, variously cited as 4600 and 2,170 light-years. The primary is a <a href="white%20supergiant">white supergiant</a>, and the secondary may be itself a binary star within a large dusty disk. Its maximum magnitude is 3.0, but it stays at a minimum magnitude of 3.8 for around a year; its most recent eclipse began in 2009. The primary has an absolute magnitude of −8.5 and an unusually high luminosity of , the reason it appears so bright at such a great distance. Epsilon Aurigae is the longest-period eclipsing binary currently known. The first observed eclipse of Epsilon Aurigae occurred in 1821, though its variable status was not confirmed until the eclipse of 1847–48. From that time forward, many theories were put forth as to the nature of the eclipsing component. Epsilon Aurigae has a noneclipsing component, which is visible as a 14th magnitude companion separated from the primary by 28.6 arcseconds. It was discovered by <a href="Sherburne%20Wesley%20Burnham">Sherburne Wesley Burnham</a> in 1891 at the <a href="Dearborn%20Observatory">Dearborn Observatory</a>, and is about 0.5 light-years from the primary.

Another eclipsing binary in Auriga, part of the "Haedi" asterism with Eta Aurigae, is <a href="Zeta%20Aurigae">Zeta Aurigae</a> (Sadatoni), an eclipsing binary star at a distance of 776 light-years with a period of 2 years and 8 months. It has an absolute magnitude of −2.3. The primary is an orange-hued K5II-type star (K-type bright giant) and the secondary is a smaller blue star similar to <a href="Regulus">Regulus</a>; its period is 972 days. The secondary is a B7V-type star, a B-type main-sequence star. Zeta Aurigae's maximum magnitude is 3.7 and its minimum magnitude is 4.0.

<a href="T%20Aurigae">T Aurigae</a> (Nova Aurigae 1891) was a nova discovered at magnitude 5.0 on January 23, 1892, by <a href="Thomas%20David%20Anderson">Thomas David Anderson</a>. It became visible to the naked eye by December 10, 1891, as shown on photographic plates examined after the nova's discovery. It then brightened by a factor of 2.5 from December 11 to December 20, when it reached a maximum magnitude of 4.4. T Aurigae faded slowly in January and February 1892, then faded quickly during March and April, reaching a magnitude of 15 in late April. However, its brightness began to increase in August, reaching magnitude 9.5, where it stayed until 1895. Over the subsequent two years, its brightness decreased to 11.5, and by 1903, it was approximately 14th magnitude. By 1925, it had reached its current magnitude of 15.5. When the nova was discovered, its spectrum showed material moving at a high speed towards Earth. However, when the spectrum was examined again in August 1892, it appeared to be a planetary nebula. Observations at the Lick Observatory by Edward Emerson Barnard showed it to be disc-shaped, with clear nebulosity in a diameter of 3 arcseconds. The shell had a diameter of 12 arcseconds in 1943. T Aurigae is classified as a <a href="slow%20nova">slow nova</a>, similar to <a href="DQ%20Herculis">DQ Herculis</a>. Like DQ Herculis, <a href="WZ%20Sagittae">WZ Sagittae</a>, <a href="Nova%20Persei%201901">Nova Persei 1901</a> and <a href="Nova%20Aquilae%201918">Nova Aquilae 1918</a>, it is a very close binary with a very short period. T Aurigae's period of 4.905 hours, comparable to DQ Herculis's period of 4.65 hours, and has a partial eclipse period of 40 minutes.

There are many other variable stars of different types in Auriga. <a href="Psi1%20Aurigae">ψ Aurigae</a> (Dolones) is an orange-hued <a href="supergiant">supergiant</a>, which ranges between magnitudes 4.8 and 5.7, though not with a regular period.

A yellow-white supergiant, it lies at a distance of 1,600 light-years. It was discovered to be variable by English amateur T.H. Astbury in 1905. It has a spectral class of F81bv, meaning that it is an F-type supergiant star. <a href="RX%20Aurigae">RX Aurigae</a> is a Cepheid variable as well; it varies in magnitude from a minimum of 8.0 to a maximum of 7.3; its spectral class is G0Iabv. It has a period of 11.62 days. <a href="RW%20Aurigae">RW Aurigae</a> is the prototype of its class of irregular variable stars. Its variability was discovered in 1906 by <a href="Lydia%20Ceraski">Lydia Ceraski</a> at the <a href="Moscow%20Observatory">Moscow Observatory</a>.

Its spectral type is G5V:e. <a href="SS%20Aurigae">SS Aurigae</a> is an <a href="SS%20Cygni">SS Cygni</a>-type variable star, classified as an explosive dwarf. Discovered by <a href="Emil%20Silbernagel">Emil Silbernagel</a> in 1907, it is almost always at its minimum magnitude of 15, but brightens to a maximum up to 60 times brighter than the minimum an average of every 55 days, though the period can range from 50 days to more than 100 days. It takes about 24 hours for the star to go from its minimum to maximum magnitude. SS Aurigae is a very close binary star with a period of 4 hours and 20 minutes. Both components are small subdwarf stars; there has been dispute in the scientific community about which star originates the outbursts. <a href="UU%20Aurigae">UU Aurigae</a> is a variable <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a> star at a distance of 2,000 light-years. It has a period of approximately 234 days and ranges between magnitudes 5.0 and 7.0.

<a href="AE%20Aurigae">AE Aurigae</a> is a blue-hued main-sequence variable star. It is normally of magnitude 6.0, but its magnitude varies irregularly. AE Aurigae is associated with the 9-light-year-wide <a href="Flaming%20Star%20Nebula">Flaming Star Nebula</a> (IC 405), which it illuminates. However, AE Aurigae likely entered the nebula only recently, as determined through the discrepancy between the radial velocities of the star and the nebula, per second and per second, respectively. It has been hypothesized that AE Aurigae is a "<a href="runaway%20star">runaway star</a>" from the young cluster in the <a href="Orion%20Nebula">Orion Nebula</a>, leaving the cluster approximately 2.7 million years ago. It is similar to <a href="53%20Arietis">53 Arietis</a> and <a href="Mu%20Columbae">Mu Columbae</a>, other runaway stars from the Orion cluster. Its spectral class is O9.5Ve, meaning that it is an <a href="O-type%20star">O-type</a> main-sequence star. The Flaming Star Nebula, is located near IC 410 in the <a href="celestial%20sphere">celestial sphere</a>. IC 410 obtained its name from its appearance in long exposure astrophotographs; it has extensive filaments that make AE Aurigae appear to be on fire.

The <a href="galactic%20anticenter">galactic anticenter</a> is located about 3.5° to the east of Beta Aurigae. This marks the point on the celestial sphere opposite the location of the <a href="Galactic%20Center">Galactic Center</a>; hence, this region marks a less extensive and less luminous part of the dust band that forms the spiral arms of the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>. Auriga has many <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a>s and other objects because the Milky Way runs through it. The three brightest open clusters are <a href="Messier%2036">M36</a>, <a href="Messier%2037">M37</a> and <a href="Messier%2038">M38</a>, all of which are visible in binoculars or a small telescope in suburban skies. A larger telescope resolves individual stars. Three other open clusters are <a href="NGC%202281">NGC 2281</a>, lying close to <a href="Psi7%20Aurigae">ψ Aurigae</a>, <a href="NGC%201664">NGC 1664</a>, which is close to <a href="Epsilon%20Aurigae">ε Aurigae</a>, and <a href="IC%20410">IC 410</a> (surrounding <a href="NGC%201893">NGC 1893</a>), a cluster with nebulosity next to <a href="IC%20405">IC 405</a>, the Flaming Star Nebula, found about midway between M38 and ι Aurigae. <a href="AE%20Aurigae">AE Aurigae</a>, a <a href="runaway%20star">runaway star</a>, is a bright variable star currently located within the Flaming Star Nebula.

M36 (NGC 1960) is a young galactic open cluster with approximately 60 stars, most of which are relatively bright; however, only about 40 stars are visible in most amateur instruments. It is at a distance of 3,900 light-years and has an overall magnitude of 6.0; it is 14 light-years wide. Its apparent diameter is 12.0 arcminutes. Of the three open clusters in Auriga, M36 is both the smallest and the most concentrated, though its brightest stars are approximately 9th magnitude. It was discovered in 1749 by <a href="Guillaume%20Le%20Gentil">Guillaume Le Gentil</a>, the first of Auriga's major open clusters to be discovered. M36 features a 10-arcminute-wide knot of bright stars in its center, anchored by <a href="Struve%20737">Struve 737</a>, a double star with components separated by 10.7 arcseconds. Most of the stars in M36 are <a href="B%20type%20main-sequence%20star">B type stars</a> with rapid rates of rotation. M36's <a href="Trumpler%20class">Trumpler class</a> is given as both I 3 r and II 3 m. Besides the central knot, most of the cluster's other stars appear in smaller knots and groups.

M37 (NGC 2099) is an open cluster, larger than M36 and at a distance of 4,200 light-years. It has 150 stars, making it the richest cluster in Auriga; the most prominent member is an orange star that appears at the center. M37 is approximately 25 light-years in diameter. It is the brightest open cluster in Auriga with a magnitude of 5.6; it has an apparent diameter of 23.0 arcminutes. M37 was discovered in 1764 by <a href="Charles%20Messier">Charles Messier</a>, the first of many astronomers to laud its beauty. It was described as "a virtual cloud of glittering stars" by <a href="Robert%20Burnham%2C%20Jr.">Robert Burnham, Jr.</a> and <a href="Charles%20Piazzi%20Smyth">Charles Piazzi Smyth</a> commented that the star field was "strewed ...with sparkling gold-dust". The stars of M37 are older than those of M36; they are approximately 200 million years old. Most of the constituent stars are <a href="A%20type%20main-sequence%20star">A type stars</a>, though there are at least 12 <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a>s in the cluster as well. M37's Trumpler class is given as both I 2 r and II 1 r. The stars visible in a telescope range in magnitude from 9.0 to 13.0; there are two 9th magnitude stars in the center of the cluster and an east to west chain of 10th and 11th magnitude stars.

M38 is a diffuse open cluster at a distance of 3,900 light-years, the least concentrated of the three main open clusters in Auriga; it is classified as a Trumpler Class II 2 r or III 2 r cluster because of this. It appears as a cross-shaped or <a href="pi%20%28letter%29">pi</a>-shaped object in a telescope and contains approximately 100 stars; its overall magnitude is 6.4. M38, like M36, was discovered by Guillaume Le Gentil in 1749. It has an apparent diameter of approximately 20 arcseconds and a true diameter of about 25 light-years. Unlike M36 or M37, M38 has a varied stellar population. The majority of the population consists of A and B type main sequence stars, the B type stars being the oldest members, and a number of <a href="G%20type%20stars">G type giant stars</a>. One yellow-hued G type star is the brightest star in M38 at a magnitude of 7.9. The brightest stars in M38 are magnitude 9 and 10. M38 is accompanied by <a href="NGC%201907">NGC 1907</a>, a smaller and dimmer cluster that lies half a degree south-southwest of M38; it is at a distance of 4,200 light-years. The smaller cluster has an overall magnitude of 8.2 and a diameter of 6.0 arcminutes, making it about a third the size of M38. However, NGC 1907 is a rich cluster, classified as a Trumpler Class I 1 m n cluster. It has approximately 12 stars of magnitude 9–10, and at least 25 stars of magnitude 9–12.

IC 410, a faint nebula, is accompanied by the bright open cluster NGC 1893. The cluster is thin, with a diameter of 12 arcminutes and a population of approximately 20 stars. Its accompanying nebula has very low <a href="surface%20brightness">surface brightness</a>, partially because of its diameter of 40 arcminutes. It appears in an amateur telescope with brighter areas in the north and south; the brighter southern patch shows a pattern of darker and lighter spots in a large instrument. NGC 1893, of magnitude 7.5, is classified as a Trumpler Class II 3 r n or II 2 m n cluster, meaning that it is not very large and is somewhat bright. The cluster possesses approximately 30 stars of magnitude 9–12. In an amateur instrument, IC 410 is only visible with an Oxygen-III filter. <a href="NGC%202281">NGC 2281</a> is a small open cluster at a distance of 1,500 light-years. It contains 30 stars in a crescent shape. It has an overall magnitude of 5.4 and a fairly large diameter of 14.0 arcseconds, classified as a Trumpler Class I 3 m cluster. The brightest star in the cluster is magnitude 8; there are approximately 12 stars of magnitude 9–10 and 20 stars of magnitude 11–13.

<a href="NGC%201931">NGC 1931</a> is a nebula in Auriga, slightly more than one degree to the west of M36. It is considered to be a difficult target for an amateur telescope. NGC 1931 has an approximate integrated magnitude of 10.1; it is 3 by 3 arcminutes. However, it appears to be elongated in an amateur telescope. Some observers may note a green hue in the nebula; a large telescope will easily show the nebula's "peanut" shape, as well as the quartet of stars that are engulfed by the nebula. The open cluster portion of NGC 1931 is classed as a I 3 p n cluster; the nebula portion is classed as both an <a href="emission%20nebula">emission</a> and <a href="reflection%20nebula">reflection nebula</a>. NGC 1931 is approximately 6,000 light-years from Earth and could easily be confused with a <a href="comet">comet</a> in the <a href="eyepiece">eyepiece</a> of a telescope.

NGC 1664 is a fairly large open cluster, with a diameter of 18 arcminutes, and moderately bright, with a magnitude of 7.6, comparable to several other open clusters in Auriga. One open cluster with a similar magnitude is <a href="NGC%201778">NGC 1778</a>, with a magnitude of 7.7. This small cluster has a diameter of 7 arcminutes and contains 25 stars. <a href="NGC%201857">NGC 1857</a>, a small cluster, is slightly brighter at magnitude 7.0. It has a diameter of 6 arcminutes and contains 40 stars, making it far more concentrated than the similar-sized NGC 1778. Far dimmer than the other open clusters is <a href="NGC%202126">NGC 2126</a> at magnitude 10.2. Despite its dimness, NGC 2126 is as concentrated as NGC 1857, having 40 stars in a diameter of 6 arcminutes.

Auriga is home to two meteor showers. The <a href="Aurigids">Aurigids</a>, named for the entire constellation and formerly called the "Alpha Aurigids", are renowned for their intermittent outbursts, such as those in 1935, 1986, 1994, and 2007. They are associated with the comet <a href="Kiess%20%28C/1911%20N1%29">Kiess (C/1911 N1)</a>, discovered in 1911 by <a href="Carl%20Clarence%20Kiess">Carl Clarence Kiess</a>. The association was discovered after the outburst in 1935 by <a href="Cuno%20Hoffmeister">Cuno Hoffmeister</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Teichgraeber">Arthur Teichgraeber</a>. The Aurigid outburst on September 1, 1935 prompted the investigation of a connection with Comet Kiess, though the 24-year delay between the comet's return caused doubt in the scientific community. However, the outburst in 1986 erased much of this doubt. Istvan Teplickzky, a Hungarian amateur meteor observer, observed many bright meteors <a href="radiant%20%28meteor%20shower%29">radiating</a> from Auriga in a fashion very similar to the confirmed 1935 outburst. Because the position of Teplickzky's observed radiant and the 1935 radiant were close to the position of Comet Kiess, the comet was confirmed as the source of the Aurigid meteor stream.

The Aurigids had a spectacular outburst in 1994, when many <a href="grazing%20meteors">grazing meteors</a>—those that have a shallow angle of entry and seem to rise from the horizon—were observed in California. The meteors were tinted blue and green, moved slowly, and left trails at least 45° long. Because they had such a shallow angle of entry, some 1994 Aurigids lasted up to 2 seconds. Though there were only a few visual observers for part of the outburst, the 1994 Aurigids peak, which lasted less than two hours, was later confirmed by Finnish amateur radio astronomer Ilkka Yrjölä. The connection with Comet Kiess was finally confirmed in 1994. The 2007 outburst of the Aurigids was predicted by <a href="Peter%20Jenniskens">Peter Jenniskens</a> and was observed by astronomers worldwide. Despite some predictions that there would be no Alpha Aurigid outburst, many bright meteors were observed throughout the shower, which peaked on September 1 as predicted. Much like in the 1994 outburst, the 2007 Aurigids were very bright and often colored blue and green. The maximum <a href="zenithal%20hourly%20rate">zenithal hourly rate</a> was 100 meteors per hour, observed at 4:15 am, California time (12:15 UTC) by a team of astronomers flying on NASA planes.

The Aurigids are normally a placid Class II meteor shower that peaks in the early morning hours of September 1, beginning on August 28 every year. Though the maximum <a href="zenithal%20hourly%20rate">zenithal hourly rate</a> is 2–5 meteors per hour, the Aurigids are fast, with an entry velocity of /sec. The annual Aurigids have a radiant located about two degrees north of <a href="Theta%20Aurigae">Theta Aurigae</a>, a third-magnitude star in the center of the constellation. The Aurigids end on September 4. Some years, the maximum rate has reached 9–30 meteors per hour.

The other meteor showers radiating from Auriga are far less prominent and capricious than the Alpha Aurigids. The <a href="Zeta%20Aurigids">Zeta Aurigids</a> are a weak shower with a northern and southern branch lasting from December 11 to January 21. The shower peaks on January 1 and has very slow meteors, with a maximum rate of 1–5 meteors per hour. It was discovered by <a href="William%20Denning">William Denning</a> in 1886 and was discovered to be the source of rare <a href="meteoroid%23Fireball">fireballs</a> by <a href="Alexander%20Stewart%20Herschel">Alexander Stewart Herschel</a>. There is another faint stream of meteors called the "Aurigids", unrelated to the September shower. This shower lasts from January 31 to February 23, peaking from February 5 through February 10; its slow meteors peak at a rate of approximately 2 per hour. The <a href="Delta%20Aurigids">Delta Aurigids</a> are a faint shower radiating from Auriga. It was discovered by a group of researchers at <a href="New%20Mexico%20State%20University">New Mexico State University</a> and has a very low peak rate. The Delta Aurigids last from September 22 through October 23, peaking between October 6 and October 15. They may be related to the <a href="September%20Epsilon%20Perseids">September Epsilon Perseids</a>, though they are more similar to the <a href="Coma%20Berenicids">Coma Berenicids</a> in that the Delta Aurigids last longer and have a dearth of bright meteors. They too have a hypothesized connection to an unknown short period retrograde comet. The <a href="Iota%20Aurigids">Iota Aurigids</a> are a hypothesized shower occurring in mid-November; its parent body may be the asteroid <a href="2000%20NL10">2000 NL10</a>, but this connection is highly disputed. The hypothesized Iota Aurigids may instead be a faint stream of <a href="Taurids">Taurids</a>.

Terns are <a href="seabird">seabird</a>s in the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> Laridae that have a worldwide distribution and are normally found near the <a href="sea">sea</a>, <a href="river">river</a>s, or <a href="wetland">wetland</a>s. Terns are treated as a subgroup of the family Laridae which includes <a href="gull">gull</a>s and <a href="skimmer">skimmer</a>s and consist of eleven <a href="genus">genera</a>. They are slender, lightly built birds with long, forked tails, narrow wings, long bills, and relatively short legs. Most species are pale grey above and white below, with a contrasting black cap to the head, but the <a href="marsh%20tern">marsh tern</a>s, the <a href="Inca%20tern">Inca tern</a>, and some <a href="Noddy%20%28tern%29">noddies</a> have dark <a href="plumage">plumage</a> for at least part of the year. The sexes are identical in appearance, but young birds are readily distinguishable from adults. Terns have a non-breeding plumage, which usually involves a white forehead and much-reduced black cap.

The terns are birds of open habitats that typically breed in noisy <a href="bird%20colony">colonies</a> and lay their eggs on bare ground with little or no nest material. Marsh terns construct floating nests from the vegetation in their wetland habitats, and a few species build simple nests in trees, on cliffs or in crevices. The <a href="white%20tern">white tern</a>, uniquely, lays its single egg on a bare tree branch. Depending on the species, one to three eggs make up the <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a>. Most species feed on fish caught by diving from flight, but the marsh terns are insect-eaters, and some large terns will supplement their diet with small land <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s. Many terns are long-distance <a href="bird%20migration">migrants</a>, and the <a href="Arctic%20tern">Arctic tern</a> may see more daylight in a year than any other animal.

Terns are long-lived birds and are relatively free from natural predators and <a href="Parasitism">parasites</a>; most species are declining in numbers due directly or indirectly to human activities, including habitat loss, pollution, disturbance, and predation by <a href="introduced%20species">introduced mammals</a>. The <a href="Chinese%20crested%20tern">Chinese crested tern</a> is in a <a href="Critically%20endangered">critical</a> situation and three other species are classed as <a href="endangered%20species">endangered</a>. International agreements provide a measure of protection, but adults and eggs of some species are still used for food in the tropics. The eggs of two species are eaten in the <a href="Caribbean">West Indies</a> because they are believed to have <a href="aphrodisiac">aphrodisiac</a> properties.

The <a href="Charadriiformes">Charadriiformes</a> <a href="order%20%28biology%29">order</a> of birds contains 18 <a href="seabird">coastal seabird</a> and <a href="wader">wader</a> <a href="family%20%28biology%29">families</a>. Within the order, the terns form a lineage with the <a href="gull">gull</a>s, and, less closely, with the <a href="skimmer">skimmer</a>s, <a href="skua">skua</a>s, and <a href="auk">auk</a>s. Early authors such as <a href="Conrad%20Gessner">Conrad Gessner</a>, <a href="Francis%20Willughby">Francis Willughby</a>, and <a href="William%20Turner%20%28naturalist%29">William Turner</a> did not clearly separate terns from gulls, but <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> recognised the distinction in his 1758 "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>", placing the gulls in the genus " <a href="Larus">Larus</a>" and the terns in "Sterna". He gave "Sterna" the description "rostrum subulatum", "<a href="bradawl">awl-shaped</a> bill", referring to the long, pointed bills typical of this group of birds, a feature that distinguishes them from the thicker-billed gulls. Behaviour and <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> suggest that the terns are more closely related to the gulls than to the skimmers or skuas, and although <a href="Charles%20Lucien%20Bonaparte">Charles Lucien Bonaparte</a> created the family Sternidae for the terns in 1838, for many years they were considered to be a subfamily, Sterninae, of the gull family, Laridae. Relationships between various tern species, and between the terns and the other Charadriiformes, were formerly difficult to resolve because of a poor <a href="fossil">fossil</a> record and the misidentification of some finds.

Following <a href="gene">gene</a>tic research in the early twenty-first century, the terns were historically treated as a separate family: Sternidae. Most terns were formerly treated as belonging to one large genus, "<a href="Sterna">Sterna</a>", with just a few dark species placed in other genera; in 1959, only the <a href="Noddy%20%28tern%29">noddies</a> and the <a href="Inca%20tern">Inca tern</a> were excluded from "Sterna". A recent analysis of <a href="Nucleic%20acid%20sequence">DNA sequences</a> supported the splitting of "Sterna" into several smaller genera. One study of part of the <a href="cytochrome%20b">cytochrome b</a> gene sequence found a close relationship between terns and a group of waders in the suborder <a href="Thinocori">Thinocori</a>. These results are in disagreement with other molecular and morphological studies, and have been interpreted as showing either a large degree of molecular <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent evolution</a> between the terns and these waders, or the retention of an ancient <a href="genotype">genotype</a>.

The word "stearn" was used for these birds in <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> as early as the eighth century, and appears in the poem "<a href="The%20Seafarer%20%28poem%29">The Seafarer</a>", written in the ninth century or earlier. Variants such as "tearn" occurred by the eleventh century, although the older form lingered on in <a href="Norfolk%20dialect">Norfolk dialect</a> for several centuries. As now, the term was used for the inland <a href="black%20tern">black tern</a> as well as the marine species. Some authorities consider "tearn" and similar forms to be variants of "stearn", while others derive the English words from Scandinavian equivalents such as Danish and Norwegian "terne" or Swedish "tärna", and ultimately from <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a> "þerna". Linnaeus adopted "stearn" or "sterna" (which the naturalist <a href="William%20Turner%20%28naturalist%29">William Turner</a> had used in 1544 as a Latinisation of an English word, presumably "stern", for the black tern) or a <a href="North%20Germanic%20languages">North Germanic</a> equivalent for his genus name "Sterna".

The <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> shows the relationships between the tern genera, and the currently recognised species, based on <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> studies, are listed below:


In addition to extant species, the fossil record includes a <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> <a href="chronospecies">palaeospecies</a>, "<a href="Sterna%20milne-edwardsii">Sterna milne-edwardsii</a>".

The genera "Anous", "Procelsterna" and "Gygis" are collectively known as noddies, the "Chlidonias" species are the marsh terns, and all other species comprise the sea terns.

Terns range in size from the <a href="least%20tern">least tern</a>, at in length and weighing , to the <a href="Caspian%20tern">Caspian tern</a> at , . They are longer-billed, lighter-bodied, and more streamlined than gulls, and their long tails and long narrow wings give them an elegance in flight. Male and female plumages are identical, although the male can be 2–5% larger than the female and often has a relatively larger bill. Sea terns have deeply forked tails, and at least a shallow "V" is shown by all other species. The noddies (genera "Anous", "Procelsterna" and "Gygis") have unusual notched-wedge shaped tails, the longest tail feathers being the middle-outer, rather than the central or outermost. Although their legs are short, terns can run well. They rarely swim, despite having webbed feet, usually landing on water only to bathe.

The majority of sea terns have light grey or white body <a href="plumage">plumage</a> as adults, with a black cap to the head. The legs and bill are various combinations of red, orange, yellow, or black depending on species. The pale plumage is conspicuous from a distance at sea, and may attract other birds to a good feeding area for these fish-eating species. When seen against the sky, the white underparts also help to hide the hunting bird from its intended prey. The Inca tern has mainly dark plumage, and three species that mainly eat insects, the black tern, <a href="white-winged%20tern">white-winged tern</a>, and <a href="black-bellied%20tern">black-bellied tern</a>, have black underparts in the breeding season. The "Anous" noddies have dark plumage with a pale head cap. The reason for their dark plumage is unknown, but it has been suggested that in tropical areas, where food resources are scarce, the less conspicuous colouration makes it harder for other noddies to detect a feeding bird. Plumage type, especially the head pattern, is linked to the <a href="Phylogenetics">phylogeny</a> of the terns, and the pale-capped, dark-bodied noddies are believed to have diverged earlier than the other genera from an ancestral white-headed gull, followed by the partially black-headed "<a href="Onychoprion">Onychoprion</a>" and "<a href="Sternula">Sternula</a>" groupings.

Juvenile terns typically have brown- or yellow-tinged upperparts, and the feathers have dark edges that give the plumage a scaly appearance. They have dark bands on the wings and short tails. In most species, the subsequent <a href="moulting">moult</a> does not start until after migration, the plumage then becoming more like the adult, but with some retained juvenile feathers and a white forehead with only a partial dark cap. By the second summer, the appearance is very like the adult, and full mature plumage is usually attained by the third year. After breeding, terns moult into a winter plumage, typically showing a white forehead. Heavily worn or aberrant plumages such as <a href="melanism">melanism</a> and <a href="albinism">albinism</a> are much rarer in terns than in gulls.

Terns have a wide repertoire of vocalisations. For example, the <a href="common%20tern">common tern</a> has a distinctive <a href="alarm%20signal">alarm</a>, "kee-yah", also used as a warning to intruders, and a shorter "kyar", given as an individual takes flight in response to a more serious threat; this quietens the usually noisy colony while its residents assess the danger. Other calls include a down-slurred "keeur" given when an adult is approaching the nest with a fish, and a "kip" uttered during social contact. Parents and chicks can locate one another by call, and <a href="sibling">sibling</a>s also recognise each other's vocalisations from about the twelfth day after hatching, which helps to keep the brood together.

Vocal differences reinforce species separation between closely related birds such as the least and <a href="little%20tern">little tern</a>s, and can help humans distinguish similar species, such as common and <a href="Arctic%20tern">Arctic tern</a>s, since flight calls are unique to each species.

Terns have a worldwide distribution, breeding on all continents including Antarctica. The northernmost and southernmost breeders are the Arctic tern and <a href="Antarctic%20tern">Antarctic tern</a> respectively. Many terns breeding in temperate zones are long-distance <a href="bird%20migration">migrants</a>, and the Arctic tern probably sees more annual daylight than any other animal as it migrates from its northern breeding grounds to Antarctic waters, a return journey of more than . A common tern that hatched in Sweden and was found dead five months later on <a href="Stewart%20Island%20/%20Rakiura">Stewart Island</a>, <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, must have flown at least . Actual flight distances are, of course, much greater than the shortest possible route. Arctic terns from Greenland were shown by radio <a href="geolocation">geolocation</a> to average on their annual migrations.

Most terns breed on open sandy or rocky areas on coasts and islands. The <a href="yellow-billed%20tern">yellow-billed</a>, <a href="Large-billed%20tern">large-billed</a>, and <a href="black-fronted%20tern">black-fronted tern</a>s breed only on rivers, and common, least and little terns also sometimes use inland locations. The <a href="marsh%20tern">marsh tern</a>s, <a href="Trudeau%27s%20tern">Trudeau's tern</a> and some <a href="Forster%27s%20tern">Forster's tern</a>s nest in inland marshes. The <a href="black%20noddy">black noddy</a> and the <a href="white%20tern">white tern</a> nest above ground level on cliffs or in trees. Migratory terns move to the coast after breeding, and most species winter near land, although some marine species, like the <a href="Aleutian%20tern">Aleutian tern</a>, may wander far from land. The <a href="sooty%20tern">sooty tern</a> is entirely oceanic when not breeding, and healthy young birds are not seen on land for up to five years after fledging until they return to breed. They lack waterproof plumage, so they cannot rest on the sea. Where they spend the years prior to breeding is unknown.

Terns are normally <a href="monogamy">monogamous</a>, although trios or female-female pairings have been observed in at least three species. Most terns breed annually and at the same time of year, but some tropical species may nest at intervals shorter than 12 months or <a href="synchronization">asynchronously</a>. Most terns become sexually mature when aged three, although some small species may breed in their second year. Some large sea terns, including the sooty and <a href="bridled%20tern">bridled tern</a>s, are four or older when they first breed. Terns normally breed in <a href="Bird%20colony">colonies</a>, and are <a href="philopatry">site-faithful</a> if their habitat is sufficiently stable. A few species nest in small or dispersed groups, but most breed in colonies of up to a few hundred pairs, often alongside other seabirds such as gulls or skimmers. Large tern species tend to form larger colonies, which in the case of the sooty tern can contain up to two million pairs. Large species nest very close together and sit tightly, making it difficult for aerial predators to land among them. Smaller species are less closely packed and <a href="Mobbing%20%28animal%20behavior%29">mob</a> intruders. <a href="Peruvian%20tern">Peruvian</a> and <a href="Damara%20tern">Damara tern</a>s have small dispersed colonies and rely on the <a href="crypsis">cryptic</a> plumage of the eggs and young for protection.

The male selects a <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">territory</a>, which he defends against <a href="conspecificity">conspecifics</a>, and re-establishes a <a href="pair%20bond">pair bond</a> with his mate or attracts a new female if necessary. Courtship involves ritualised flight and ground displays, and the male often presents a fish to his partner. Most species have little or no nest, laying the eggs onto bare ground, but Trudeau's tern, Forster's tern and the marsh terns construct floating nests from the vegetation in their wetland habitats. Black and <a href="lesser%20noddy">lesser noddies</a> build nests of twigs, feathers and excreta on tree branches, and <a href="brown%20noddy">brown</a>, <a href="Blue%20noddy">blue</a>, and <a href="Grey%20noddy">grey noddies</a> make rough platforms of grass and seaweed on cliff ledges, in cavities or on other rocky surfaces. The Inca tern nests in crevices, caves and disused burrows, such as that of a <a href="Humboldt%20penguin">Humboldt penguin</a>. The white tern is unique in that it lays its single egg on a bare tree branch.

Tropical species usually lay just one egg, but two or three is typical in cooler regions if there is an adequate food supply. The time taken to complete the <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> varies, but for temperate species <a href="egg%20incubation">incubation</a> takes 21–28 days. The eggs of most gulls and terns are brown
with dark splotches, so they are difficult for predators to spot on the beach. The <a href="precocial">precocial</a> chicks <a href="fledge">fledge</a> in about four weeks after hatching. Tropical species take longer because of the poorer food supply. Both parents incubate the eggs and feed the chicks, although the female does more incubating and less fishing than her partner. Young birds migrate with the adults. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with individuals typically returning for 7–10 breeding seasons. Maximum known ages include 34 for an Arctic tern and 32 for a sooty. Although several other species are known to live in captivity for up to 20 years, their greatest recorded ages are underestimates because the birds can outlive their <a href="bird%20ringing">rings</a>. Interbreeding between tern species is rare, and involves closely related species when it occurs. Hybrids recorded include common tern with roseate, Sandwich with lesser-crested, and black with white-winged.

Most terns hunt fish by diving, often hovering first, and the particular approach technique used can help to distinguish similar species at a distance. Sea terns often hunt in association with <a href="porpoise">porpoise</a>s or predatory fish, such as <a href="bluefish">bluefish</a>, <a href="tuna">tuna</a> or <a href="bonito">bonito</a>s, since these large marine animals drive the prey to the surface. Sooty terns feed at night as the fish rise to the surface, and are believed to sleep on the wing since they become waterlogged easily. Terns of several species will feed on <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s, following the plough or hunting on foot on <a href="mudflat">mudflat</a>s. The marsh terns normally catch insects in the air or pick them off the surface of fresh water. Other species will sometimes use these techniques if the opportunity arises. An individual tern's foraging efficiency increases with its age.

The <a href="gull-billed%20tern">gull-billed tern</a> is an opportunist predator, taking a wide variety of prey from marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats. Depending on what is available it will eat small crabs, fish, <a href="crayfish">crayfish</a>, <a href="grasshopper">grasshopper</a>s and other large insects, lizards and <a href="amphibian">amphibian</a>s. <a href="Warm-blooded">Warm-blooded</a> prey includes <a href="mouse">mice</a> and the eggs and chicks of other beach-breeding birds; least terns, little terns and members of its own species may be victims. The <a href="greater%20crested%20tern">greater crested tern</a> will also occasionally catch unusual <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a> species such as <a href="Agamidae">agamid lizards</a> and <a href="green%20sea%20turtle">green sea turtle</a> hatchlings, and follows trawlers for discards.

The eyes of terns cannot <a href="Accommodation%20%28eye%29">accommodate</a> under water, so they rely on accurate sighting from the air before they plunge-dive. Like other seabirds that feed at the surface or dive for food, terns have red oil droplets in the <a href="cone%20%28eye%29">cones</a> of their <a href="retina">retina</a>s; birds that have to look through an air/water interface have more deeply coloured <a href="carotenoid">carotenoid</a> <a href="pigment">pigment</a>s in the oil drops than other species. The pigment also improves visual contrast and sharpens distance vision, especially in hazy conditions, and helps terns to locate shoals of fish, although it is uncertain whether they are sighting the <a href="phytoplankton">phytoplankton</a> on which the fish feed, or other feeding birds. The red colouring reduces <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> sensitivity, which in any case is an adaptation more suited to terrestrial feeders like the gulls, and this protects the eye from UV damage.

The inaccessibility of many tern colonies gave them a measure of protection from <a href="mammal">mammal</a>ian predators, especially on islands, but <a href="introduced%20species">introduced species</a> brought by humans can seriously affect breeding birds. These can be predators such as <a href="fox">fox</a>es, <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a>s, <a href="cat">cat</a>s and <a href="rat">rat</a>s, or animals that destroy the habitat, including <a href="rabbit">rabbit</a>s, <a href="goat">goat</a>s and <a href="pig">pig</a>s. Problems arise not only on formerly mammal-free islands, as in New Zealand, but also where an alien <a href="carnivore">carnivore</a>, such as the <a href="American%20mink">American mink</a> in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, presents an unfamiliar threat.

Adult terns may be hunted by <a href="owl">owl</a>s and <a href="bird%20of%20prey">raptor</a>s, and their chicks and eggs may be taken by <a href="heron">heron</a>s, <a href="crow">crow</a>s or gulls. Less obvious nest predators include <a href="ruddy%20turnstone">ruddy turnstone</a>s in the Arctic, and gull-billed terns in little tern colonies. Adults may be robbed of their catch by avian <a href="Kleptoparasitism">kleptoparasites</a> such as <a href="frigatebird">frigatebird</a>s, skuas, other terns or large gulls.

External <a href="parasitism">parasite</a>s include <a href="Mallophaga">chewing lice</a> of the genus "<a href="Saemundssonia">Saemundssonia</a>", <a href="Bird%20louse">feather lice</a> and fleas such as "<a href="Ceratophyllus%20borealis">Ceratophyllus borealis</a>". Lice are often host specific, and the closely related common and Arctic terns carry quite different species. Internal parasites include the <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a> "<a href="Reighardia%20sternae">Reighardia sternae</a>", and <a href="cestoda">tapeworms</a> such as "<a href="Ligula%20intestinalis">Ligula intestinalis</a>" and members of the genera "<a href="Diphyllobothrium">Diphyllobothrium</a>" and "<a href="Schistocephalus">Schistocephalus</a>". Terns are normally free of blood parasites, unlike gulls that often carry "<a href="Haemoproteus">Haemoproteus</a>" species. An exception is the brown noddy, which sometimes harbours <a href="protozoa">protozoa</a> of that genus. In 1961 the common tern was the first wild bird species identified as being infected with avian influenza, the <a href="Influenza%20A%20virus%20subtype%20H5N3">H5N3</a> variant being found in an outbreak involving South African birds. Several species of terns have been implicated as carriers of <a href="West%20Nile%20virus">West Nile virus</a>.

Terns and their eggs have long been eaten by humans and island colonies were raided by sailors on long voyages since the eggs or large chicks were an easily obtained source of <a href="protein">protein</a>. Eggs are still illegally harvested in southern Europe, and adults of wintering birds are taken as food in West Africa and South America. The roseate tern is significantly affected by this hunting, with adult survival 10% lower than would otherwise be expected. In the West Indies, the eggs of roseate and sooty terns are believed to be <a href="aphrodisiac">aphrodisiac</a>s, and are disproportionately targeted by egg collectors. Tern skins and feathers have long been used for making items of clothing such as capes and hats, and this became a large-scale activity in the second half of the nineteenth century when it became fashionable to use feathers in <a href="hatmaking">hatmaking</a>. This trend started in Europe but soon spread to the Americas and Australia. White was the preferred colour, and sometimes wings or entire birds were used.

Terns have sometimes benefited from human activities, following the plough or fishing boats for easy food supplies, although some birds get trapped in nets or swallow plastic. Fishermen looked for feeding tern flocks, since the birds could lead them to fish shoals. <a href="Overfishing">Overfishing</a> of small fish such as <a href="sand%20eel">sand eel</a>s can lead to steep declines in the colonies relying on these prey items. More generally, the loss or disruption to tern colonies caused by human activities has caused declines in many species. Pollution has been a problem in some areas, and in the 1960s and 1970s <a href="DDT">DDT</a> caused egg loss through thinning of the shells. In the 1980s, <a href="organochloride">organochloride</a>s caused severe declines in the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a> area of the US. Because of their sensitivity to pollutants, terns are sometimes used as indicators of contamination levels.

Habitat enhancements used to increase the breeding success of terns include floating nest platforms for black, common and Caspian terns, and artificial islands created for a number of different species. More specialised interventions include providing nest boxes for roseate terns, which normally nest in the shelter of tallish vegetation, and using artificial <a href="zostera">eelgrass</a> mats to encourage common terns to nest in areas not vulnerable to flooding.

A number of terns face serious threats, and the <a href="Chinese%20crested%20tern">Chinese crested tern</a> is classed as "<a href="critically%20endangered">critically endangered</a>" by <a href="BirdLife%20International">BirdLife International</a>. It has a population of fewer than 50 birds and a breeding range of just 9 km (3.5 mi). It is declining due to egg collection, human disturbance and the loss of coastal wetlands in China. Three other species are categorised as "<a href="Endangered%20species">endangered</a>", with declining populations of less than 10,000 birds. The South Asian black-bellied tern is threatened by habitat loss, egg collecting for food, pollution and predation. In New Zealand, the black-fronted tern is facing a rapid fall in numbers due to predation by introduced mammals and <a href="Australian%20magpie">Australian magpie</a>s. Disturbance by cattle and sheep and by human activities is also a factor. The Peruvian tern was initially damaged by the collapse of <a href="Peruvian%20anchoveta">anchoveta</a> stocks in 1972, but breeding colonies have subsequently been lost due to building, disturbance and pollution in their coastal wetlands.

The <a href="Australasia">Australasia</a>n <a href="fairy%20tern">fairy tern</a> is described as "<a href="Vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a>". Disturbance by humans, dogs and vehicles, predation by introduced species and inappropriate water level management in <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> are the main reasons for its decline. Five species are "<a href="near%20threatened">near threatened</a>", indicating less severe concerns or only potential vulnerability. The <a href="elegant%20tern">elegant tern</a> is so categorised because 95% of the population breeds on one island, <a href="San%20Lorenzo%20Marine%20Archipelago%20National%20Park">Isla Rasa</a> in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20California">Gulf of California</a>, and the <a href="Kerguelen%20tern">Kerguelen tern</a> has a population of less than 5,000 adults breeding on small and often stormy Pacific islands. Three species, the Inca, Damara, and <a href="river%20tern">river tern</a>s, are expected to decline in the future due to habitat loss and disturbance. Some tern <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> are endangered, including the <a href="California%20least%20tern">California least tern</a> and the <a href="Easter%20Island">Easter Island</a> race of the grey noddy.

Most tern species are declining in numbers due to the loss or disturbance of breeding habitat, pollution and increased predation. Gull populations have increased over the last century because of reduced persecution and the availability of food from human activities, and terns have been forced out of many traditional nesting areas by the larger birds. A few species are defying the trend and showing local increases, including the Arctic tern in <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>, Forster's tern around the Great Lakes, the <a href="Sandwich%20tern">Sandwich tern</a> in eastern North America and its yellow-billed subspecies, the Cayenne tern, in the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>.

Terns are protected by international legislation such as the <a href="Agreement%20on%20the%20Conservation%20of%20African-Eurasian%20Migratory%20Waterbirds">Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</a> (AEWA) and the US-Canada <a href="Migratory%20Bird%20Treaty%20Act%20of%201918">Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918</a>. Parties to the AWEA agreement are required to engage in a wide range of conservation strategies described in a detailed action plan. The plan is intended to address key issues such as species and habitat conservation, management of human activities, research, education, and implementation. The North American legislation is similar, although there is a greater emphasis on protection.

Kingdom Hearts (video game)

The game was a departure from Square's standard role-playing games, introducing a substantial <a href="action-adventure%20game">action</a> and <a href="hack%20and%20slash">hack and slash</a> element to the gameplay. "Kingdom Hearts" has an <a href="all-star">all-star</a> <a href="voice%20acting">voice cast</a> and includes many of the Disney characters' official voice actors. It was longtime Square character designer <a href="Tetsuya%20Nomura">Tetsuya Nomura</a>'s first time in a directorial position.

"Kingdom Hearts" was praised for its unusual combination of action and role-playing, as well as its unexpectedly harmonious mix of Square and Disney elements. It was a large presence in the 2002 <a href="Christmas%20and%20holiday%20season">holiday season</a>, receiving numerous year-end game awards, and went on to achieve <a href="List%20of%20Sony%20Greatest%20Hits%20games">Sony "Greatest Hits"</a> status. The game prompted numerous sequels, and the "Kingdom Hearts" series has gone on to ship over 30 million copies worldwide. "Kingdom Hearts" is the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20PlayStation%202%20video%20games">tenth best-selling PlayStation 2 game of all time</a>, and is considered by some gaming publications to be <a href="List%20of%20video%20games%20considered%20the%20best">one of the greatest video games of all time</a>. The game's success resulted in a Japan-exclusive re-release of the game featuring extra content, "Kingdom Hearts Final Mix", released in December 2002. 

The "Final Mix" version of the game was re-mastered in high definition and released globally in 2013 as a part of the "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20HD%201.5%20Remix">Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix</a>" collection for the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a>.

"Kingdom Hearts" is influenced by its parent franchise, "Final Fantasy", and carries gameplay elements over into its own action-based, <a href="hack%20and%20slash">hack and slash</a> system. The main battle party consists of three characters: Sora, Donald Duck, and Goofy. Sora is directly controlled by the player from a third person camera angle. All other party members are computer-controlled, though the player can customize their behavior to an extent through the pause menu. Donald and Goofy comprise the party in most areas, but nearly every level features a character who may replace them. For instance, <a href="Jack%20Skellington">Jack Skellington</a> can join Sora's party in Halloween Town, but cannot accompany the player elsewhere. In some worlds, the party changes its appearance, has abilities unique to that world or both; the characters can fly in Neverland, acquire aquatic forms in Atlantica which enable them to survive underwater, and gain Halloween costumes in Halloween Town to blend in with the locals.

Like traditional role-playing games, "Kingdom Hearts" features an <a href="experience%20point">experience point</a> system that determines character development. As enemies are defeated, the <a href="player%20character">player character</a>s gain experience and grow stronger, gaining access to new <a href="Statistic%20%28role-playing%20games%29%23Skills">abilities</a>. Unlike other games of its type, "Kingdom Hearts" allows a degree of character development customization through a short tutorial found at the beginning of the game. The tutorial allows the player to select from one of three main attributes―strength, defense, or magic―for Sora to excel in and one to lack in. By choosing certain options, the player may manipulate how Sora learns abilities, <a href="Attribute%20%28role-playing%20games%29">grows statistically</a>, and gains levels. Donald, Goofy, and any other additional party members are assigned specific areas of strength from the outset. Donald excels in magic, while Goofy excels in defense and special attacks.

The game progresses linearly from one story event to the next, usually presented as a <a href="cutscene">cutscene</a>, though there are numerous <a href="Quest%20%28gaming%29">side quests</a> available that provide benefits to the characters. Players may also choose the order in which they tackle some areas. Most of the gameplay occurs on interconnected field maps where battles take place. Combat in "Kingdom Hearts" occurs in real time and involves pressing buttons to initiate attacks by the on-screen character. An action menu, similar to those found in "Final Fantasy" games, found at the bottom left of the screen provides other combat options such as using magic and items, although players can also assign selected magic spells that can be instantly used whilst holding the shoulder button. As players progress through the game, they can receive certain Disney characters as summons, such as <a href="Dumbo">Dumbo</a> and <a href="Tinker%20Bell">Tinker Bell</a>, each with their own unique abilities. There is also a context-sensitive option at the bottom of the menu, usually used for interacting with the environment or performing special attacks. This menu is manipulated by using the right analog stick or digital pad, while movement is controlled by the left analog stick, allowing the player to navigate the menu while avoiding or approaching enemies.

Sora, along with his allies, both possess a Hit Point (HP) meter and a Magic Point (MP) meter, which increase as they gain experience and level up. The MP meter is divided into various sections that are used up whenever that character performs magic, with more powerful magic using more MP. MP can be replenished by performing melee attacks or using items. The HP meter determines the character's health, reducing whenever a character takes damage, although it can be replenished by using healing items or spells. If one of Sora's allies runs out of health, they will be knocked out temporarily until someone heals them. However, if Sora loses all of his health, the game ends and the player must resume play from the beginning of an area or boss. Defeating enemies causes various orbs to fall; green orbs which replenish health, blue orbs which restore MP, and yellow orbs which represent Munny, the game's currency, which can be used to purchase new items.

The Gummi Ship is the mode of travel between the various worlds in the game. The gameplay for piloting the vessel is different from the rest of the game as it switches to a <a href="Shoot%20%27em%20up%23Types">rail shooter</a> format. The player controls the Gummi Ship from a rear third-person perspective as it travels in an outer space setting. While traveling, the player must avoid obstacles and defend against enemy ships that attempt to destroy the player's vessel by firing missiles or ramming it. Surviving the route allows access to the next world. Once the player's gummi ship is destroyed, it will have the option to either return to the world selection menu or retry the level. At the beginning of the game, there are few options available to customize the vessel, but as the game progresses, new weapons, engines, and armor become available. Different pre-designed blueprints can be found throughout the game that can be used to quickly construct Gummi Ships. Geppetto also gives the player different Gummi Ship designs based on the number of Heartless defeated. From the start, the player can travel between worlds by using "Normal Drive", which initiates the rail shooter-like minigame. Later in the game, Sora can acquire a "Warp Drive," which allows instant travel between previously-visited worlds without having to play the minigame. However, worlds that have not been visited cannot be accessed with Warp Drive, and must be discovered normally first.

The universe of "Kingdom Hearts" is a collection of various <a href="Level%20%28computer%20and%20video%20games%29">levels</a>, referred to as "worlds," through which the player must progress. Thirteen can be accessed in the game and one, Disney Castle, is shown in cutscenes. Additional worlds are mentioned by various characters, but are inaccessible because they have been destroyed by the <a href="Universe%20of%20Kingdom%20Hearts%23Heartless%20and%20Nobodies">Heartless</a>. Ten Disney worlds are based on fiction, primarily from the <a href="List%20of%20Disney%20theatrical%20animated%20features">Disney animated features canon</a>, and the other four were created by Square specifically for the game.

The graphics and characters of each worlds were designed to resemble the artwork style of each Disney films. Each Disney world is inhabited by characters from the film: including <a href="Hercules%20%28Disney%20character%29">Hercules</a> and <a href="List%20of%20Disney%27s%20Hercules%20characters%23Phil">Philoctetes</a> in Olympus Coliseum, and <a href="Aladdin%20%28Disney%20character%29">Aladdin</a>, <a href="Princess%20Jasmine">Princess Jasmine</a> and <a href="Jafar%20%28Aladdin%29">Jafar</a> in Agrabah. Each world is disconnected from the others and exists separately. Most characters in the worlds are unaware of other ones, with few exceptions. Players travel from one world to another via Gummi Ship.

The worlds created specifically for the game mirror the overall appearance of the other worlds and feature either new characters or ones from several "Final Fantasy" games. The new worlds include: the Destiny Islands, where the story opens; Traverse Town, which serves as a launching point for most of the game; Hollow Bastion, which many of the "Final Fantasy" characters call home; and the End of the World, a large, dark world created from the remnants of various worlds consumed by the Heartless. The main characters travel from world to world to seal each "Keyhole"; this protects the world from the Heartless and ultimately from destruction. They also try to minimize their interaction with characters of other worlds to maintain a balance of separation. This sometimes requires Sora, Donald and Goofy to blend in with the world inhabitants by changing their physical appearance.

The collaboration between Disney and Square resulted in a mixture of familiar Disney and Square characters, as well as several new characters created and designed by Tetsuya Nomura. The primary protagonist of the game is <a href="Sora%20%28Kingdom%20Hearts%29">Sora</a>, a 14-year-old boy chosen to wield the Keyblade—a weapon which is a cross between a key and a sword—for battling darkness. The game also features two friends from his home world, <a href="Characters%20of%20Kingdom%20Hearts%23Riku">Riku</a> and <a href="Characters%20of%20Kingdom%20Hearts%23Kairi">Kairi</a>. For most of the game, Sora is joined by <a href="Donald%20Duck">Donald Duck</a> and <a href="Goofy">Goofy</a>. Donald, the court wizard, and Goofy, captain of the royal guard, are sent from Disney Castle to find the Keyblade. The three join forces to search for King <a href="Mickey%20Mouse">Mickey Mouse</a>, Kairi, and Riku. The primary antagonist is <a href="Characters%20of%20Kingdom%20Hearts%23Xehanort">Ansem</a>, who seeks power and knowledge by using dark beings called the <a href="Universe%20of%20Kingdom%20Hearts%23Heartless%20and%20Nobodies">Heartless</a>. The Heartless, hearts corrupted by darkness, serve as most of the enemies encountered in the game and come in a variety of shapes and sizes. <a href="Maleficent">Maleficent</a>, from the 1959 film "<a href="Sleeping%20Beauty%20%281959%20film%29">Sleeping Beauty</a>", leads a group of <a href="Disney%20villains">Disney villains</a> that seeks to use the Heartless for their own gain.

As a game meant to explore the fictional universes of various Disney films, over one hundred Disney characters are featured in various capacities. While many serve as major characters in the story, others appear in cameo roles, such as the <a href="One%20Hundred%20and%20One%20Dalmatians">One Hundred and One Dalmatians</a> playing a part in a side-quest. Most worlds also feature a Disney villain whom the player must defeat. The player can summon various Disney characters to fight alongside Sora in battle, causing Donald and Goofy to withdraw from the battlefield for the duration of the summon. Available summoned characters include the <a href="Genie%20%28Aladdin%29">Genie</a> from "<a href="Aladdin%20%281992%20Disney%20film%29">Aladdin</a>", <a href="Tinker%20Bell">Tinker Bell</a> from "<a href="Peter%20Pan%20%281953%20movie%29">Peter Pan</a>", and <a href="Simba">Simba</a> from "<a href="The%20Lion%20King">The Lion King</a>", among others.

Square also incorporated several characters from the "Final Fantasy" series into the game, though the characters were slightly altered to fit the game's back-story. On the Destiny Islands, the player meets younger versions of <a href="Tidus">Tidus</a> and <a href="Characters%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%20X%20and%20X-2%23Wakka">Wakka</a> from "Final Fantasy X", and <a href="Characters%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%20VIII%23Selphie%20Tilmitt">Selphie</a> from "Final Fantasy VIII". In Traverse Town, the player encounters <a href="Squall%20Leonhart">Squall Leonhart</a> (also known as "Leon") from "Final Fantasy VIII", as well as <a href="Aerith%20Gainsborough">Aerith</a>, <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Final%20Fantasy%20VII%20series%23Cid%20Highwind">Cid</a>, and <a href="Yuffie%20Kisaragi">Yuffie</a> from "Final Fantasy VII". <a href="Rikku">Rikku</a> from "Final Fantasy X" was originally set to appear, but was replaced by Yuffie. <a href="Cloud%20Strife">Cloud</a> and <a href="Sephiroth%20%28Final%20Fantasy%29">Sephiroth</a>, both from "Final Fantasy VII", make appearances in Olympus Coliseum, where the player can fight them in tournaments. The emphasis on characters from later "Final Fantasy" installments stems from Nomura's hesitation to use characters he did not design. The game also uses other "Final Fantasy" icons such as the <a href="Character%20design%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%23Moogle">Moogles</a> who mediate item synthesis.

Sora, Riku, and Kairi build a raft with the intent to leave the Destiny Islands and explore new worlds. On the night before the planned voyage, the islands are attacked by the Heartless, and Riku and Kairi disappear. Before the Heartless consume the islands, Sora obtains the Keyblade, a weapon effective against the Heartless. Meanwhile, King Mickey has left his own world to deal with the increasing number of Heartless, leaving instructions for Donald and Goofy to find the "key" that will protect the worlds from the encroaching darkness. Donald and Goofy use the Gummi Ship to reach Traverse Town, where they find Sora after he has drifted there from his destroyed world. The three decide to travel together – Donald and Goofy to find Mickey, and Sora to find Kairi and Riku – traveling to various worlds and "Keyholes" in the worlds that, when sealed, prevent the "heart" of those worlds from being consumed by the Heartless. Meanwhile, a group of Disney villains led by Maleficent seek out the seven <a href="Characters%20of%20Kingdom%20Hearts%23Princesses%20of%20Heart">Princesses of Heart</a> to unlock the final keyhole that leads to Kingdom Hearts, a repository of knowledge and power, and the source of all hearts. Maleficent also finds Riku and recruits him into her services, convincing him that Sora abandoned him and a comatose Kairi while offering her aid to him.

Sora and his friends eventually arrive at Hollow Bastion, Maleficent's headquarters, where Riku takes the Keyblade from Sora, revealing himself to be its intended user while Sora only received it in his absence; Donald and Goofy reluctantly leave Sora as per their orders. Sora later challenges Riku, stating that his heart derives strength from his friends, inspiring Donald and Goofy to return to him and regaining control of the Keyblade. After the three defeat Maleficent, Sora finds Kairi's body and confronts Riku, who is now possessed by Ansem, a figure who has been manipulating Maleficent from the beginning to open the way to Kingdom Hearts. Ansem reveals Kairi as the seventh Princess of Heart, her heart having transferred into Sora's body when the Destiny Islands were destroyed. After defeating the possessed Riku, Sora impales himself with Ansem's Keyblade, which is designed to unlock hearts, releasing both his and Kairi's hearts; Kairi's heart returns to her body, in turn completing the final Keyhole, while Sora becomes a Heartless. Kairi later recognizes Sora's Heartless, and the light in her heart restores him to human form.

After Kairi gives him a good luck charm, Sora and his group venture to the End of the World to fight Ansem as he reaches the door to Kingdom Hearts, which Ansem believes to be the ultimate reservoir of darkness before being obliterated by the light that bursts through the door. Also beyond the door are Mickey and Riku, who help Sora and his friends close the door before Sora and Mickey lock it with their Keyblades from both sides. The worlds lost to the Heartless reconstruct themselves; as the Destiny Islands reform, Kairi returns there while Sora is forced to part with her. Transported to a winding road, Sora, Donald, and Goofy resolve to find Riku and Mickey.

The initial idea for "Kingdom Hearts" began with a discussion between <a href="Shinji%20Hashimoto">Shinji Hashimoto</a> and <a href="Hironobu%20Sakaguchi">Hironobu Sakaguchi</a> about "<a href="Super%20Mario%2064">Super Mario 64</a>". They were planning to make a game with freedom of movement in three dimensions like "Super Mario 64" but lamented that only characters as popular as Disney's could rival a Mario game. <a href="Tetsuya%20Nomura">Tetsuya Nomura</a>, overhearing their conversation, volunteered to lead the project and the two producers agreed to let him direct. A chance meeting between Hashimoto and a Disney executive in an elevator—Square and Disney had previously worked in the same building in Japan—allowed Hashimoto to pitch the idea directly to Disney. Nomura struck down a number of proposals from Disney in order to pursue his own concept featuring an original character not based on a Disney property. The production team consisted of over one hundred members from both Square and <a href="Disney%20Interactive">Disney Interactive</a>. The game began development in February 2000 and originally focused more on the gameplay with a simple story to appeal to Disney's target age range. After executive producer <a href="Hironobu%20Sakaguchi">Hironobu Sakaguchi</a> told director Tetsuya Nomura the game would be a failure if it did not aim for the same level as the "Final Fantasy" series, Nomura began to develop the story further. When choosing the Disney worlds to include in the game, Nomura and his team tried to pick worlds that had distinctively different looks. They also tried to take into account worlds with Disney characters that would be interesting. Thanks to support from Disney's then-president and current chairman and chief executive <a href="Bob%20Iger">Bob Iger</a>, the team had few restrictions on which worlds they could use from the Disney franchises. However, they tried to remain within each character's boundaries set by their respective Disney films. In a June 2013 interview, Nomura stated the name of the game was inspired by <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Parks%20and%20Resorts">Disney Theme Parks</a>, particularly <a href="Disney%27s%20Animal%20Kingdom">Animal Kingdom</a>, which had recently opened when development on the game began. However, Nomura could not secure the <a href="Intellectual%20property">IP</a> as just "Kingdom". Later on, when the development team began to think about "hearts" as a core part of the story, it was decided to combine the two to form the title "Kingdom Hearts".

Additional content was added to the North American release that was absent in the initial Japanese release: new optional bosses, one of which was named after the winner of the official website's "Name-In-Game" sweepstakes, an extra difficulty level, and a teaser of "Kingdom Hearts II" accessible by meeting certain criteria. Nomura included the teaser in order to gauge fan reaction to the possibility of a sequel; he felt that if the idea was unpopular, then it would be best to leave certain events in the game unexplained. The new content was later added to the Japanese re-release "Kingdom Hearts Final Mix". "Final Mix" included further additional content such as new items, cutscenes, and enemies, such as a new secret boss that sets up the sequel. The new content further hinted at plotlines that would be explained in sequels. Some content omitted from "Kingdom Hearts" was later added into "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20II">Kingdom Hearts II</a>". A world based on "<a href="The%20Lion%20King">The Lion King</a>", for instance, was unfeasible because an additional program was required to process movement on four legs—a necessity since Sora would become a lion in that world. Due to time constraints, the developers left out an optional boss battle, similar to the Sephiroth battle, against <a href="Tifa%20Lockhart">Tifa Lockhart</a>. She was later included in "Kingdom Hearts II" as a more developed character.

<a href="Yoko%20Shimomura">Yoko Shimomura</a> composed and produced the music of "Kingdom Hearts". While there are <a href="Arrangement">arranged</a> melodies derived from previous Disney films, most of the soundtrack consists of original themes written specifically for the game by Shimomura. The opening orchestration and ending credits theme were arranged and orchestrated by <a href="Kaoru%20Wada">Kaoru Wada</a> and performed by the <a href="New%20Japan%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">New Japan Philharmonic Orchestra</a>. The main vocal theme for the original Japanese release is titled . The English version of "Hikari," "<a href="Simple%20and%20Clean">Simple and Clean</a>," was used in the Western releases and the Japanese re-release, "Final Mix". Both versions were composed and performed by <a href="Hikaru%20Utada">Hikaru Utada</a>. Her involvement, along with the Japanese song title, was announced in January 2002. Utada was the only singer Nomura had in mind for the "Kingdom Hearts" theme song. This marked the first time Utada had produced a song for a video game. The single, "Hikari," was released in Japan on March 20, 2002 and proved to be very popular; by August 2002, it had sold over 860,000 copies in Japan. The "Kingdom Hearts" soundtrack was released on a two CD set on March 27, 2002 in Japan and a year later in the United States. The soundtrack was later included in the "<a href="Music%20of%20Kingdom%20Hearts%23Kingdom%20Hearts%20Original%20Soundtrack%20Complete">Kingdom Hearts Original Soundtrack Complete</a>", which was released in Japan on March 28, 2007. Music from "Kingdom Hearts" was also included in Shimomura's best works compilation album "Drammatica".

"Kingdom Hearts" featured well-known voice actors for both the Japanese and English versions. The Japanese version featured <a href="Miyu%20Irino">Miyu Irino</a> as Sora, <a href="Risa%20Uchida">Risa Uchida</a> as Kairi, and <a href="Mamoru%20Miyano">Mamoru Miyano</a> as Riku. Other notable voice actors included <a href="K%C5%8Dichi%20Yamadera">Kōichi Yamadera</a>, <a href="Hideo%20Ishikawa">Hideo Ishikawa</a>, and <a href="Maaya%20Sakamoto">Maaya Sakamoto</a>. A special effort was made to preserve the official voice actors of characters from the Disney movies used in "Kingdom Hearts". Some of the voice actors from the related television series or direct-to-video sequels were chosen over the original voice actors from films, where applicable (e.g. <a href="Dan%20Castellaneta">Dan Castellaneta</a> as Genie, rather than <a href="Robin%20Williams">Robin Williams</a>). The English version featured <a href="Haley%20Joel%20Osment">Haley Joel Osment</a> as Sora, <a href="David%20Gallagher">David Gallagher</a> as Riku, and <a href="Hayden%20Panettiere">Hayden Panettiere</a> as Kairi. Other notable voice actors included <a href="Billy%20Zane">Billy Zane</a>, <a href="Christy%20Carlson%20Romano">Christy Carlson Romano</a>, <a href="David%20Boreanaz">David Boreanaz</a>, <a href="James%20Woods">James Woods</a>, and <a href="Mandy%20Moore">Mandy Moore</a>.

"Kingdom Hearts" was announced at the <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> in May 2001. Initial details were that it would be a collaboration between Square and Disney Interactive and would feature worlds developed by both companies and Disney characters. New characters were designed by Nomura and included Sora, Riku, Kairi, and the Heartless. A playable demo was available at the <a href="Tokyo%20Game%20Show">Tokyo Game Show</a> in 2001. The gameplay of the demo showcased many action role-playing game elements that would be included in the final product. To help market the English release of the game, Square launched the official website in April 2002, which featured trailers, a "Name-In-Game" sweepstakes, and other Internet content. On May 14, 2002, a press release announced a list of the English voice actors. The list included Haley Joel Osment, David Gallagher, and Hayden Panettiere as the three new characters introduced in the game. It also announced that many of the Disney characters would be voiced by the official voice actors from their respective Disney films. Other marketing efforts included auctions of the game and related items before the North American release and a Consumer Demo Day in <a href="San%20Francisco%2C%20California">San Francisco, California</a>.

"Kingdom Hearts" received positive reviews and sales figures. During the first two months of its North American release it was one of the top three highest-selling video games and was among the top selling titles during the 2002 Christmas and holiday season. In November 2002, <a href="UBS%20AG">UBS Warburg</a> listed it as the 6th highest console game in terms of sales during the week of November 5. At the end of April 2003, Square announced that "Kingdom Hearts" had sold its millionth copy in the United States, which made it eligible for PlayStation's "Greatest Hits" status, and over 3.0 million worldwide. Sales reached 1.2 million in Japan in the first quarter of 2004, and broke 4.0  million worldwide. In December 2005, the <a href="NPD%20Group">NPD Group</a> listed it as "one of the top ten best-selling PlayStation 2 titles of all time in North America." By July 2006, "Kingdom Hearts" had <a href="Sell-through">sold through</a> 2.6 million copies and earned $100 million in the United States alone. "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>" ranked it as the seventh highest-selling game launched for the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a>, <a href="Xbox%20%28console%29">Xbox</a> or <a href="GameCube">GameCube</a> between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. As of December 2006, "Kingdom Hearts" had shipped over 5.6 million copies worldwide with 1.1 million in <a href="PAL%20region">PAL region</a>s, 1.5 million in Japan, and 3.0 million in North America. As of 2006, the original game and the "Final Mix" version had sold 6 million copies on PS2. As of February 2019 , the "Kingdom Hearts" series has shipped more than 30 million copies worldwide.

The game received critical acclaim among reviewers. In <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Best of 2002 awards, it was nominated for "PS2's Best Game of 2002 Editor's Choice Award" and was a runner up for "PS2's Best Game of 2002 Reader's Choice Award." In 2007, the website listed "Kingdom Hearts" as the 22nd best PlayStation 2 game of all time. Critics commended the visuals, orchestral score, voice acting, and hybrid action-adventure and role-playing feel to the game. IGN named it "Best Art Style/Direction," runner-up for "Best CG Graphics," and honorable mention for "Best Animation" in IGN's 2003 list of "Best Looking Games on PS2." <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a> listed "Kingdom Hearts" twice in its "Top 25 Video Game Cinematic Moments." "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" stated that the graphics were "gorgeous," giving them high marks. The audio was also praised, particularly the quality of the voice-overs and musical score. "GamePro" had positive comments on the overall audio and gave that aspect a perfect score.

Criticism about the gameplay was mixed. Many reviews complained that the camera was at times frustrating and the Gummi Ship portions were out of place. GameSpot cited "tedious" gameplay and Gummi Ship sections as "pale imitations of the <a href="Star%20Fox%20%28series%29">"Star Fox" series</a>," but stated that the combat was fun, particularly the boss fights. <a href="MediaWorks%20%28publisher%29">Dengeki Online</a> commented on the camera controls, saying that the camera would often run into objects while being rotated by the player. "GamePro" compared the battle system to "old <a href="Nintendo%2064">N64</a> <a href="The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda">"Zelda" games</a>" and had positive comments about Donald and Goofy's <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>.

GameSpot commented that the concept of mixing the serious elements of "Final Fantasy" with the lighter elements of Disney seemed impossible, but was pulled off quite well. Because of that they awarded "Kingdom Hearts" "Best Crossover Since "<a href="SNK%20vs.%20Capcom%20%28series%29">Capcom vs. SNK</a>"" in their 2002 Best and Worst of the Year awards. GameSpy noted that the periodic departure from the main plot into the Disney side stories was disappointing, and when the original plot builds to a climax, "the story fails to gel thanks to a confusing mish-mash of vague terms and symbolism that probably made more sense in the director's head than in this final product." Aside from the plot, they stated that the overall package was worth playing through to the end. <a href="G4%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29">G4TV</a> awarded it "Best Story" at their 2003 <a href="G-Phoria">G-Phoria</a> awards show. Fan response was also positive; "Kingdom Hearts" was voted as the 19th best game of all-time by readers of the Japanese magazine "<a href="Famitsu">Famitsu</a>", 16th by the users of website <a href="GameFAQs">GameFAQs</a>, and 92nd by IGN users. "Kingdom Hearts" ranked ninth on IGN's most recent "Top 25 PS2 Games of All Time" list. It was also a nominee for the Best Game Award from the for 2001-2002. In the making of the 2004 video game "<a href="Fullmetal%20Alchemist%20and%20the%20Broken%20Angel">Fullmetal Alchemist and the Broken Angel</a>" the developers, <a href="Racjin">Racjin</a>, looked at other titles for inspiration, particularly "Kingdom Hearts" when making the game.

Multiple versions of "Kingdom Hearts" have been released. The first was the original Japanese release, followed by the North American and PAL releases, which includes additional content. The game was later <a href="international%20version">re-released</a> in Japan as "Kingdom Hearts Final Mix", which features the content of the North American/PAL release, as well as more new content.

Both Square and Disney also released numerous types of merchandise before and after the release of the game. Merchandise ranged from toys and figurines to clothing items and books. Like the "Final Fantasy" games, Square released an "<a href="Ultimania">Ultimania</a>" book on "Kingdom Hearts" in Japan following the release of the game and a revised edition following the release of "Final Mix". In North America, a strategy guide was released by <a href="Brady%20Games">Brady Games</a>. It featured a comprehensive walkthrough and a sticker activity journal. A <a href="List%20of%20Kingdom%20Hearts%20media%23Manga">manga series</a> based on the game was released in Japan and the United States. A novel series also based on the game was released in Japan. It was authored by Tomoco Kanemaki and illustrated by Shiro Amano. The novel series consists of two volumes and was released in North America on March 25, 2008.

Originally released only in Japan on December 26, 2002, "Kingdom Hearts Final Mix" has several events and a number of gameplay tweaks that are not in previous releases. Spoken dialogue is in English, with Japanese subtitles. New scenes, clarifying certain plot points, such as Riku's journey and foreshadowing of "Kingdom Hearts II", were included, but no new dialogue was recorded. A gameplay option allows the player to skip cutscenes after seeing them once. The optional bosses first included in the English version were introduced to Japanese players for the first time, along with a new fight against "<a href="Organization%20XIII%23Xemnas">Unknown Man</a>," in an attempt to raise interest for the sequel.

In another attempt at foreshadowing, a video titled "Another Side, Another Story 【 deep dive 】" plays at the ending if the player accomplishes certain tasks. New music tracks incorporated were "Disappeared" and "Another Side." The "Night on Bald Mountain" and "One-Winged Angel" tracks from the English version were included as well. Other changes include new abilities, new weapons, new items, additional and recolored enemies, and gameplay tweaks to make the game easier for the player, along with two new levels of difficulty. When first released, "Final Mix" included either a deck of "Kingdom Hearts" cards or special music CD. A limited "Platinum Edition" version of "Kingdom Hearts Final Mix" was later released with an action figure of Sora, a sticker set, and sketches of some of the main characters.

It was released for the first time in North America, Europe and Australia as part of "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20HD%201.5%20Remix">Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix</a>".

The game was adapted into a manga by <a href="Shiro%20Amano">Shiro Amano</a>. The story follows the events that took place in the game with a few minor differences to account for the loss of interactivity a video game provides. Some events that took place in the "Final Mix" version were also included. The manga was originally serialized in Japan by <a href="Enterbrain">Enterbrain</a>'s "Famitsū PS2", but has since been released worldwide in four volumes. The volumes have been published in English in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> by <a href="Tokyopop">Tokyopop</a>. The first volume was released on October 11, 2005, and the fourth volume was released on July 10, 2006. The entire series was later released in a boxed set on October 10, 2006.

The manga series has had moderate success. The first volume was ranked 95th in "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>"s "Top 150 best sellers" during the week of its release. IGN praised Amano's artwork and commented on wanting to replay the game after reading. They criticized the lack of new content and stated the transition from game to print lost most of the story's appeal. The series was followed by others based on the game's sequels: "" and "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20II">Kingdom Hearts II</a>".

During August 2011, Nomura expressed desire to release a high definition rerelease of the game though he had yet to confirm such plans. In September 2012, Square Enix announced "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20HD%201.5%20Remix">Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix</a>", a compilation for the PlayStation 3, that includes both "Kingdom Hearts Final Mix" and "" in HD and trophy support. The character models from "" were used as a base for the game's characters. The gameplay of the original "Kingdom Hearts" was modified to play more like "Kingdom Hearts II". Additionally, the collection includes HD cinematic scenes from "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20358/2%20Days">Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days</a>". It was released in Japan on March 14, 2013, in North America on September 10, 2013, on September 12, 2013 for Australia, and September 13, 2013 for Europe.

In June 2013, Nomura stated that the original game assets for "Kingdom Hearts" had been lost some time ago. He explained, "[The game data] was lost, so we had to research, and we had to dig out from the actual game what was available and recreate everything for HD. We had to recreate all the graphics and it was actually not that easy."

In October 2016, Square Enix announced a single-disc compilation release of "Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix" and "Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix" for the PlayStation 4. It was released on March 9, 2017, in Japan, and was released on March 28, 2017, in North America, and March 31, 2017, in Europe. An additional piece of free <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable content</a> for the PS4 version released in June 2017 added a Theater mode for "Kingdom Hearts Final Mix".

"Kingdom Hearts" was followed by several sequels, becoming the first game in the "Kingdom Hearts" series. It was followed by a direct sequel, "", on the Nintendo <a href="Game%20Boy%20Advance">Game Boy Advance</a>, which was released in Japan on November 11, 2004. "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20II">Kingdom Hearts II</a>" is the third game in the series, set one year after "Chain of Memories", and was released in Japan on December 22, 2005 for Sony PlayStation 2. Like the first game it was re-released as "Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix" alongside a PS2 remake of "Chain of Memories". A "Kingdom Hearts" game was developed exclusively for <a href="V%20CAST">V CAST</a>, <a href="Verizon%20Wireless">Verizon Wireless</a>'s broadband service, and was released on October 1, 2004 in Japan and on February 4, 2005 in the United States. In November 2008, "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20coded">Kingdom Hearts coded</a>" was released for mobile phones in Japan, the game takes place after the events of "Kingdom Hearts II". A followup, "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20358/2%20Days">Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days</a>", was developed for the <a href="Nintendo%20DS">Nintendo DS</a> and released in Japan on May 30, 2009 and in North America on September 29, 2009. A prequel was released in Japan on January 9, 2010, entitled "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20Birth%20by%20Sleep">Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep</a>", for the <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a>, which takes place 10 years before the events of "Kingdom Hearts". The following title in the series was "" for the <a href="Nintendo%203DS">Nintendo 3DS</a>, released in 2012. At <a href="E3%202013">E3 2013</a>, "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20III">Kingdom Hearts III</a>" was announced to be in development for the <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a>.

Australian raven

The Australian raven ("Corvus coronoides") is a <a href="passerine">passerine</a> <a href="bird">bird</a> in the genus "<a href="Corvus%20%28genus%29">Corvus</a>" native to much of southern and northeastern Australia. Measuring in length, it has all-black plumage, beak and mouth, as well as strong grey-black legs and feet. The upperparts are glossy, with a purple, blue, or green sheen, and its black feathers have grey bases. The Australian raven is distinguished from the <a href="Australian%20crow">Australian crow</a> species by its throat hackles, which are prominent in adult birds. Older adult individuals have white <a href="iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a>es, younger adults have white irises with an inner blue rim, while younger birds have dark brown irises until fifteen months of age, and hazel irises with an inner blue rim around each <a href="pupil">pupil</a> until age two years and ten months. <a href="Nicholas%20Aylward%20Vigors">Nicholas Aylward Vigors</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Horsfield">Thomas Horsfield</a> described the Australian raven in 1827, its species name ("coronoides") highlighting its similarity with the <a href="carrion%20crow">carrion crow</a> ("C. corone"). Two <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> are recognized, which differ slightly in calls and are quite divergent genetically.

The preferred habitat is open woodland and transitional zones. It has adapted well to urban environments and is a common city bird in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>, and <a href="Perth">Perth</a>. An <a href="omnivorous">omnivorous</a> and opportunistic feeder, it eats a wide variety of plant and animal material, as well as food waste from urban areas. In eastern Australia, its range is strongly correlated with the presence of sheep, and it has been blamed for killing lambs. However, this is very rare, and the raven most often scavenges for afterbirth and stillborn animals as well as newborn lamb faeces. The Australian raven is territorial, with pairs generally bonding for life. Breeding takes place between July and September, with almost no variation across its range. The nest is a bowl-shaped structure of sticks sited high in a tree, or occasionally in a man-made structure such as a windmill or other building.

The Australian raven was first described by <a href="Nicholas%20Aylward%20Vigors">Nicholas Aylward Vigors</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Horsfield">Thomas Horsfield</a> in 1827, when they reported <a href="George%20Caley">George Caley</a>'s early notes on the species from the Sydney district. Its specific epithet "coronoides" "crow-shaped" is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> "corone"/κορόνη "crow" and "eidos"/είδος "shape" or "form". The two naturalists regarded the Australian raven as very similar in appearance to the <a href="carrion%20crow">carrion crow</a> ("C. corone") of Europe, though they noted it was larger with a longer bill. They did not give it a common name. The location where the <a href="Type%20%28biology%29">type specimen</a> was collected is not recorded, but thought to be in the <a href="Parramatta">Parramatta</a> district. <a href="Christian%20Ludwig%20Brehm">Christian Ludwig Brehm</a> described "Corvus affinis" in 1845, later determined to be this species. In his 1865 "<a href="Handbook%20to%20the%20Birds%20of%20Australia">Handbook to the Birds of Australia</a>", <a href="John%20Gould">John Gould</a> recognised only one species of corvid in Australia, "Corvus australis", which he called the white-eyed crow. He used <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20Gmelin">Johann Friedrich Gmelin</a>'s 1788 name, which predated Vigors and Horsfield's description. In 1877 <a href="Richard%20Bowdler%20Sharpe">Richard Bowdler Sharpe</a> recognised two species, but recorded that the feather bases of the type specimen of "C. coronoides" were white. He named "C. coronoides" as the "crow" and "C. australis" (as "Corone australis") the "raven". Scottish naturalist <a href="William%20Robert%20Ogilvie-Grant">William Robert Ogilvie-Grant</a> corrected this in 1912 after re-examining the type specimen, clarifying the species as "C. coronoides" (raven, and incorporating little and forest ravens) and "C. cecilae" (<a href="Torresian%20crow">Torresian crow</a>).

<a href="Gregory%20Mathews">Gregory Mathews</a> described the western subspecies "perplexus" in 1912, naming it the southwestern crow and noting that it was smaller than the nominate subspecies. He called "C. coronoides coronoides" the eastern crow, listing its range as New South Wales, and described what is now the <a href="Australian%20crow">Australian crow</a> as another subspecies, "C. coronoides cecilae", calling it the north-western crow and recording its range as northwestern Australia. In the same work he listed the raven as "Corvus marianae", with a type specimen from Gosford and listing its range as New South Wales. He listed the <a href="little%20raven">little raven</a> and <a href="forest%20raven">forest raven</a> as subspecies. Mathews had erected "C. marianae" in 1911 as the name after declaring "Corvus australis" Gould to be preoccupied; French-American ornithologist <a href="Charles%20Vaurie">Charles Vaurie</a> acted as <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Zoological%20Nomenclature%23Principle%20of%20the%20First%20Reviser">First Revisor</a> under Article 24 of the <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Zoological%20Nomenclature">International Code of Zoological Nomenclature</a> (ICZN) Code and discarded "C. australis" as a junior homonym—in 1788, Gmelin had used the same binomial name to describe the <a href="black%20nunbird">black nunbird</a>—to preserve the stability of the name. This has been followed by later authors.

German ornithologist <a href="Erwin%20Stresemann">Erwin Stresemann</a> lumped all Australian corvids plus other species as far as India into a single species, "C. coronoides", as he believed there was intergradation between all characteristics such as iris colour, colour of feather bases and plumage. This was hotly disputed by Mathews. The official <a href="Royal%20Australasian%20Ornithologists%20Union">RAOU</a> checklist listed three species (Australian raven, Torresian crow and little crow), with the little raven recognised as a fourth species in 1967 and forest raven in 1970. Stresemann described "C. difficilis" in 1943 from a single specimen, now thought to have been an unusual Australian raven or an Australian raven/Torresian crow hybrid.

Alternative names sometimes seen include southern raven, southern crow and Kelly, the last thought to have alluded to <a href="Ned%20Kelly">the Kelly Gang</a>, though did not appear until the 1920s. Southern crow was considered by the RAOU before Australian raven was adopted as the official name for the species in 1926. The term "crow" is colloquially applied to any or all species of Australian corvid. The Australian raven was called "wugan" by the local <a href="Eora">Eora</a> and <a href="Darug%20people">Darug</a> inhabitants of the <a href="Sydney%20Basin">Sydney Basin</a>.

The Australian raven's closest relatives are the other two species of raven occurring in Australia: the <a href="little%20raven">little raven</a> and <a href="forest%20raven">forest raven</a>. The Australian raven is also somewhat closely related to the Torresian and little crow, although not as closely related as it is to the other raven species. Initial single gene genetic analysis of the genus using mitochondrial DNA showed the three raven species to belong to one lineage and the two crows to another. The genetic separation between species is small and there was a suggestion the little raven may be nested within the Australian raven, though the authors conceded more genetic work was needed. Subsequent multigene analysis using <a href="nuclear%20DNA">nuclear DNA</a> by Jønsson and colleagues in 2012 showed the eastern and western subspecies of the Australian raven to form two clades, almost as genetically distinct as the forest and little raven are to each other. This led the authors to propose that the subspecies be recognised as separate species.
Ian Rowley proposed that the common ancestor of the five species diverged into a tropical crow and temperate raven sometime after entering Australia from the north, which molecular evidence indicates occurred in the early <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a> epoch around 4 million years ago. The raven diverged into the ancestor of the forest and little ravens in the east and Australian raven in the west, this split occurring around 2 million years ago in the early <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>. As the climate became cooler and drier, the aridity of central Australia split them entirely. Furthermore, the eastern birds diverged into nomadic little ravens and, in forested refuges, forest ravens. As the climate eventually became warmer, the western birds spread eastwards and almost outcompeted forest ravens on mainland Australia. Rowley noted that the western subspecies of the Australian raven had features intermediate between the eastern subspecies of Australian and little ravens.

Two subspecies are recognised:

Measuring in length with a wingspan and weighing around , the adult Australian raven is an all black-bird with a black beak, mouth and tongue and sturdy black or grey-black legs and feet. The <a href="Tibiotarsus">tibia</a> is fully feathered and the <a href="Tarsometatarsus">tarsus</a> is long, and the feet large and strong. It has white <a href="Iris%20%28anatomy%29">irises</a>. The plumage is glossy with a blue-purple to a blue-green sheen, greenish over the ear coverts, depending on the light. The underparts are not glossy. The Australian raven has throat feathers (hackles) that are <a href="wikt%3Alanceolate">lanceolate</a> with rounded tips, while the other four species of Australian corvids have bifurcate tips, though this can be difficult to see in the field. The hackles are also longer than those of the other four species; when they are raised (such as when the bird is calling), they give the bird an unusual bearded appearance. The upper third of the upper mandible, including the nares and nasal groove, is covered with bristles, which can be up to long. The heavy-set beak is tipped with a slight hook, and is longer than the bird's head. The wings are long and broad, with the longest of its ten <a href="Flight%20feather%23Primaries">primary feathers</a> (usually the seventh but occasionally the eighth) almost reaching the end of the tail when the bird is at rest. The tail is rounded or wedge-shaped. The Australian raven can be distinguished from the two species of crow occurring in Australia by the grey base of the feathers, which is white in the latter species. The demarcation between pale and black regions on the feather is gradual in the ravens and sharply delineated in the crows. Feather bases are not normally visible when observing birds in the field, but can sometimes be seen on a windy day if the feathers are ruffled. Unlike the other four species, the Australian raven has a bare patch of skin under and extending to beside, the bill. This can be hard to discern in the field. The three species of raven are more heavily set with a broader chest than the two crow species, with the forest raven the stockiest of all. Relative size of species is only useful when two species can be seen side by side, as the overlap in size is large and the difference in size small.

Juveniles resemble adults, but lack throat hackles, and sometimes have a pink fleshy <a href="gape">gape</a>. The bill is shorter and shallower; its base can be pinkish and the tip can be light grey. The plumage is more ruffled and softer in appearance, lacks the glossy highlights and often having a brown tinge. The bare skin on the throat is pink in birds that have recently left the nest. Eye colour varies with age, gradually lightening from juvenile to adult. Nestlings up to four months old have blue-grey irises, juveniles aged from four to fifteen months have dark brown irises, and immature birds have hazel irises with an inner blue rim around each pupil until age two years and ten months. Immature birds older than one year develop hackles, while some pink remains in the gape until the bird is two or three years of age.

The territorial call of the Australian raven is a slow, high "ah-ah-aaaah" with the last note drawn out. It uses this call to communicate with other Australian ravens in the area. When giving this call, the species has a horizontal posture, holding its head forward and body parallel to the ground, while perched on a prominent position. It ruffles its hackles and lowers its tail, and sometimes holds its beak open between calls. In contrast, the little raven and forest raven hold their bodies in an upright posture. This call becomes louder if trespassers encroach upon the Australian raven's territory. The five Australian species are very difficult to tell apart, with the call being the easiest way to do so, although the drawing-out of the final note—long held to be solely recorded for the Australian raven—has been recorded for the other species and is hence not diagnostic.

The volume, pitch, tempo and order of notes can be changed depending on the message the Australian raven intends to convey. There is a variety of <a href="contact%20call">contact call</a>s: a pair often makes a low murmuring sound when preening each other while roosting, and members of a flock carry on with a quiet chattering while at rest. Birds make a call and answer sequence if temporarily out of sight of one another while foraging. Birds in flocks make a single high-pitched "caa" while flying over another territory as a transit call to signify they are just passing through. An Australian raven will give a longer "caa" with a downward inflection to signify its return to the nest to its mate.

The Australian raven is common throughout eastern Australia, and southern <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a> (the populations being connected by a narrow strip across the <a href="Nullarbor%20Plain">Nullarbor Plain</a>), but it is rarer and more scattered in the north, with isolated sightings in Cape York at <a href="Coen%2C%20Queensland">Coen</a>, Windmill Creek and the <a href="Mitchell%20River%20%28Queensland%29">Mitchell River</a>, and becoming more common south of <a href="Rockhampton">Rockhampton</a> in central Queensland. It is found throughout New South Wales, though is uncommon in the northeast of the state. It is rare in the <a href="Australian%20Alps">Australian Alps</a>, being replaced there by the little raven. It occurs across Victoria and eastern South Australia, through the <a href="Eyre%20Peninsula">Eyre Peninsula</a> and <a href="Nullarbor%20Plain">Nullarbor Plain</a> into Western Australia, across the state north to the <a href="Wooramel%20River">Wooramel River</a>. It is found on some offshore islands such as <a href="Rottnest%20Island">Rottnest Island</a> and <a href="Kangaroo%20Island">Kangaroo Island</a>. It is a rare vagrant to <a href="Lord%20Howe%20Island">Lord Howe Island</a>., though it was recorded as a vagrant in <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> in the 1870s, this has not been confirmed.

The Australian raven can be found in a wide range of natural and modified habitats. It requires available water and trees (or buildings) to roost in or perch on. Preferred habitats include <a href="eucalypt">eucalypt</a>-dominated <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forest, and farmland adjacent to trees. It is also found in heath and mangroves. In areas where it occurs with the little raven, namely over much of central New South Wales, Victoria and into South Australia, the Australian raven is restricted to more forested areas while the latter species prefers more open areas. Similarly, in inland Australia it can share a range with the little crow, as the two do not appear to compete. However, the ranges of similar-sized forest raven and Torresian crow only narrowly overlap with the Australian raven as all three compete with each other. In central and western regions, Australian ravens and Torresian crows vie for the scattered uncommon trees and outcrops, and only one or the other are found there. It co-occurs with the forest raven in northeastern New South Wales from <a href="Port%20Stephens%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Port Stephens</a> northwards. The Australian raven has adapted very well to human habitation in some cities and is the most common <a href="Corvidae">corvid</a> in <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>, <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> and <a href="Perth">Perth</a>; in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> and <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a> it is replaced by the little raven, and by the Torresian crow in <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>. Its large range, abundance and increasing population mean it is classified as "Least Concern" on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>.

Difficulties in distinguishing Australian corvids has hampered understanding of seasonal movements. The Australian raven is thought to be largely sedentary, with most movement of over due to flocks of non-breeding subadult birds. Juvenile birds leave their parents and join flocks when they are four or five months old. Smaller flocks of 8–30 birds stay within an area of around 260 square kilometres, while larger flocks of up to 300  birds may travel hundreds of kilometres seeking food.

A single breeding pair and their brood can occupy a territory of up to around and remains there year-round, though groups of ravens may enter this area to forage. Australian ravens will defend their territory by chasing, dive-bombing and occasionally striking the backs of birds of prey, foxes or even people. They generally mate for life, though occasionally one male has been found to be mated with two females in adjacent territories. If the female dies, the male Australian raven maintains the territory and finds another mate, while if the male bird is lost, the female abandons the territory. No courtship behaviour has been observed, and species that mate for life often lack elaborate courting displays. Once they begin breeding at three years of age, they live another four to five years on average. During this time they produce two surviving young each year on average. The longest-lived Australian raven recorded is an adult (of at least 3 years of age) that was banded and recaptured alive 12 years and 5 months later.

Australian ravens generally walk when moving around on the ground, though do hop when hurrying. They preen themselves frequently, particularly when roosting in the middle of the day. They also engage in allopreening, where birds will preen each other's head and neck. This takes place particularly in autumn, winter and spring, and is important in pair bonding. Either member may initiate it, generally by landing near the other bird, shuffling next to its mate, then bending its head forward and presenting its nape.

Australian ravens begin breeding once they are three years old. Breeding season is from July to September, with no substantial difference in timing across its range around the country despite it inhabiting a range of diverse climates and habitats across 19 degrees of latitude. Rowley has pointed out this is unusual for a bird species with a wide range and has postulated that breeding is initiated by day length. Rarely, breeding can take place in May, June or October. Australian ravens generally nest in tall trees, never near to the ground as some species do. The nest also functions as a lookout post and so tall or emergent trees are selected. The ravens occasionally nest on buildings, telegraph poles, or tall windmills which allow the species to occupy areas lacking in tall trees. Windmills may have assisted the spread of the species in North Queensland and the Northern Territory. The highest recorded corvid nest in Australia was found atop the <a href="AWA%20Tower">AWA Tower</a> in Sydney.

Nests are generally large and untidy, consisting of a bowl or platform of sticks lined with grasses, barks, and feathers that can be up to thick. As they are relatively heavy, they are built on larger forks in trees rather than out in the canopy. Building the nest is often time-consuming initially as the birds try (and often fail) to wedge sticks, which are long and thick, into the tree fork to make a platform. Thinner sticks and rootlets are used to make the bowl before the bowl is lined with feathers. Both birds build the nest, with the female taking over the lining of the nest while the male brings her material. New nests are built each year generally, as the re-use of old ones might spread disease or parasites—nests become caked with faeces as the nestlings grow and the parents cannot keep up with its removal. Furthermore, old nests often disintegrate within twelve months due to their exposed locations. The female develops a <a href="brood%20patch">brood patch</a>—a patch of bare skin on the bird's underparts that reddens and becomes much more extensive from around three weeks before the first egg is laid. The skin itself is oedematous and wrinkled, and does not get re-feathered until December after the breeding season has finished.

Their lofty locations makes monitoring of Australian raven nests difficult. A clutch can comprise up to six eggs, though usually four or five are laid, with five being the most common number. Measuring , eggs are pale green or bluish-green and splotched with darker olive, brown and blackish markings. Eggs are quite variable, and thus which Australian corvid laid them cannot be reliably identified. <a href="Avian%20incubation">Incubation</a> of the eggs is done solely by the female over roughly 20 days. Incubation is intermittent initially, becoming constant by the time the third or fourth egg is laid. Only one brood is raised per year, though a second clutch may be laid if the first clutch is lost early in the season. Late clutches have poor survival rates, possibly due to chicks getting dehydrated on hot days as the year progresses or being eaten by wedge-tailed eagles. The chicks are <a href="altricial">altricial</a> and <a href="nidicolous">nidicolous</a>; that is, they are born helpless, naked and blind, and remain in the nest for an extended period. They have pink skin until 5 days of age, when feathers under the skin turn it grey. They lose their <a href="egg%20tooth">egg tooth</a> at the same time. Their eyes begin opening at 5 to 6 days of age and are fully open by 11 to 12 days, by which time their feathers begin emerging. At 14 days, their primary feathers begin emerging, and they are fully feathered by 35–36 days old. They leave the nest at 40–45 days of age, and stay with the parents for three to four months after that. They follow their parents and beg for food for the first month outside the nest but are feeding themselves by the third month. Young birds are often attacked when they enter neighbouring territories, and melees ensue as their parents try to defend them and herd them back.

The Australian raven is omnivorous, though eats more meat than smaller corvids. Its diet in summer contains a high proportion of insects, while more plant items are eaten in autumn. Flesh makes up over half its diet in winter. Invertebrates commonly eaten include <a href="spider">spider</a>s, <a href="millipede">millipede</a>s, <a href="centipede">centipede</a>s (which ravens behead before eating), <a href="grasshopper">grasshopper</a>s, <a href="cicada">cicada</a>s and <a href="caterpillar">caterpillar</a>s (especially of the family <a href="Noctuidae">Noctuidae</a>), which are important in feeding nestlings. Australian ravens sometimes eat <a href="Common%20yabby">yabbies</a> ("Cherax destructor") from the edges of dams. Unusually for a ground-feeding omnivore, <a href="earthworm">earthworm</a>s are rarely eaten. Australian ravens have been reported killing birds of such size as young <a href="galah">galah</a>s ("Eolophus roseicapillus") and <a href="common%20starling">starlings</a> ("Sturnus vulgaris"). Most mammals are eaten as carrion, as many species are too large for the raven to kill, though young rabbits are a frequent prey item. Australian ravens drink water frequently, up to ten times a day in hot weather. Birds have been observed dunking pieces of meat in water before eating them, as well as doing the same with hard biscuits to make them soggy and soft.

Australian ravens are intelligent birds, and like many other corvids have innovative methods of seeking out food. Foraging takes place in the early morning or late afternoon; birds rest in the hotter part of the day. Food is taken mainly from the ground, birds either finding objects while flying overhead or by walking along and looking. However, they occasionally feed in trees—Australian ravens forage eucalypt foliage for <a href="Christmas%20beetle">Christmas beetle</a>s ("Anoplognathus"), and devote a substantial amount of time to look for nests and eggs to eat. They have also been known to take golf balls from fairways, possibly mistaking them for eggs. Ravens use their bill rather than their feet to explore or turn items on the ground (rocks or sticks) over or hold or snatch food while flying. They have also been recorded using fence posts as anvils to bash snails against before eating them. Australian ravens most often eat food where they find it unless taking food back for nestlings. Occasionally they have been observed caching carrion or a killed animal in a hole nearby to store it. They can pack shredded meat in their mouth under their tongue. Australian ravens have adapted well to eating food scraps in urban areas, such as school playgrounds, rubbish tips, bins outside supermarkets or restaurants, abattoirs, piggeries and farmyards. In one isolated study, they were observed feeding on nectar from eucalypt flowers. Australian ravens sometimes forage in <a href="mixed-species%20foraging%20flock">mixed-species flocks</a> with any of the other four species of Australian corvids. Sometimes they are aggressive with little ravens if both are at a food source and drive them off, though not if the smaller species greatly outnumber the larger.

A <a href="circovirus">circovirus</a>—given the name raven circovirus or RaCV—was isolated from an Australian raven suffering from feather lesions in 2006. It has affinities with canary circovirus (CaCV) and pigeon circovirus (PiCV). Its clinical significance is unknown. Tick infestation is rare in the Australian raven, with "<a href="Ixodes%20holocyclus">Ixodes holocyclus</a>" and "<a href="Amblyomma%20triguttatum">Amblyomma triguttatum</a>" recorded. Lice and <a href="Hippoboscidae">hippoboscid</a> flies have been recorded yet little-researched, and an infestation by the fly "<a href="Passeromyia%20longicornis">Passeromyia longicornis</a>" was recorded in one nest.

The <a href="wedge-tailed%20eagle">wedge-tailed eagle</a> ("Aquila audax") preys on adult, nestling, and fledgling Australian ravens, while the <a href="little%20eagle">little eagle</a> ("Hieraaetus morphnoides") also takes nestlings, and <a href="powerful%20owl">powerful owl</a> ("Ninox strenua") has been recorded killing adults; other birds of prey are seen as threats, yet there is no evidence they have successfully preyed on the ravens. The introduced <a href="red%20fox">red fox</a> ("Vulpes vulpes") competes with the Australian raven for carrion and can drive it off. It may also kill young birds that it catches on the ground. The <a href="channel-billed%20cuckoo">channel-billed cuckoo</a> ("Scythrops novaehollandiae") has been recorded as a <a href="brood%20parasite">brood parasite</a>.

Australian ravens sometimes die by being shot or poisoned—generally by farmers. Despite their fondness for roadkill, fewer ravens are hit by vehicles than <a href="Australian%20magpie">Australian magpie</a>s. Research in the 1950s and 60s showed that 64% of Australian ravens perished in their first year of life. Immature birds are most at risk of dying. The Australian raven is a peaceful bird, showing no aggression toward humans or other birds without reason. However, the Australian raven is frequently blamed for the loss of young lambs. Scientific observation in the country's southeast showed that the killing of healthy lambs was rare, but that sick animals were predisposed to being attacked. Australian ravens mostly eat faeces (often from the lamb's anus), afterbirth or stillborn lambs. Newborn lamb faeces is nutritious, containing around 21–44% protein, 9–37% fat and 10–30% carbohydrate. It has the consistency of treacle and often sticks to the lamb's hindquarters or tail. The raven bites a sleeping lamb's tail, holding on and walking behind it when it wakes up. A healthy lamb would respond by running away or butting the bird, but a sick one might not respond and be attacked further as it alerts the bird that it is vulnerable. Wounded lambs can also succumb to "<a href="Clostridium">Clostridium</a>" infection as these bacteria are present on raven bills. Ravens bring some benefits to agricultural areas as they clean away carrion and eat insects that are potentially damaging to crops. In areas of Western Australia, the species is classified as a Declared Pest of Agriculture under the provisions of the "Agriculture and Related Resources Protection Act 1976", meaning that shooting on private land in rural areas is legal, although should be considered only after other options have been exhausted.

In Australian <a href="Australian%20Aborigines">Aboriginal</a> <a href="Australian%20Aboriginal%20mythology">mythology</a>, <a href="Crow%20%28Australian%20Aboriginal%20mythology%29">Crow</a> is a <a href="trickster">trickster</a>, <a href="culture%20hero">culture hero</a> and ancestral being. In the <a href="Kulin">Kulin</a> nation in central <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> he was known as "Waa" (also "Wahn" or "Waang") and was regarded as one of two <a href="Australian%20Aboriginal%20kinship">moiety ancestors</a>, the other being the more sombre <a href="eaglehawk">eaglehawk</a> "<a href="Bunjil">Bunjil</a>".

Aldwych tube station

Aldwych is a <a href="List%20of%20former%20and%20unopened%20London%20Underground%20stations">closed station</a> on the <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a>, located in the <a href="City%20of%20Westminster">City of Westminster</a> in <a href="Central%20London">Central London</a>. It was opened in 1907 with the name Strand, after <a href="Strand%2C%20London">the street</a> on which it is located, and was the terminus of the short <a href="Piccadilly%20line">Piccadilly line</a> branch from <a href="Holborn%20tube%20station">Holborn</a> that was a relic of the merger of two railway schemes. The station building is close to the Strand's junction with Surrey Street, near <a href="Aldwych">Aldwych</a>. During its lifetime, the branch was the subject of a number of unrealised extension proposals that would have seen the tunnels through the station extended southwards, usually to <a href="Waterloo%20tube%20station">Waterloo</a>.

Served mostly by a <a href="shuttle%20train">shuttle train</a> and having low passenger numbers, the station and branch were considered for closure several times. Service was offered only during weekday peak hours from 1962 and discontinued in 1994, when the cost of replacing the <a href="elevator">lifts</a> was considered too high for the income generated.

Disused parts of the station and the running tunnels were used during both world wars to shelter artworks from London's public galleries and museums from bombing. The station has long been popular as a filming location and has appeared as itself and as other London Underground stations in a number of films. In recognition of its historical significance, the station is a Grade II <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a>.

The station is surrounded by <a href="King%27s%20College%20London">King's College</a> buildings today, including purpose-built floors above dating to 1930.

The <a href="Great%20Northern%20and%20Strand%20Railway">Great Northern and Strand Railway</a> (GN&SR) first proposed a station in the Strand area in a <a href="private%20bill">private bill</a> presented to Parliament in November 1898. The station was to be the southern terminus of an underground railway line planned to run from <a href="Alexandra%20Palace%20railway%20station">Wood Green</a> station (now Alexandra Palace) via <a href="Finsbury%20Park%20station">Finsbury Park</a> and <a href="King%27s%20Cross%20St.%20Pancras%20tube%20station">King's Cross</a> and was originally to be located at the corner of Stanhope Street and Holles Street, north of the Strand. When the two streets were scheduled for demolition as part of the <a href="London%20County%20Council">London County Council</a>'s plans for the construction of <a href="Kingsway%2C%20London">Kingsway</a> and <a href="Aldwych">Aldwych</a>, the GN&SR moved the location to the junction of the two new roads. <a href="Royal%20Assent">Royal Assent</a> to the bill was given and the "Great Northern and Strand Railway Act 1899" was enacted on 1 August. 

In September 1901, the GN&SR was taken over by the <a href="Brompton%20and%20Piccadilly%20Circus%20Railway">Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway</a> (B&PCR), which planned to build an underground line from <a href="South%20Kensington%20tube%20station">South Kensington</a> to <a href="Piccadilly%20Circus%20tube%20station">Piccadilly Circus</a> via <a href="Knightsbridge%20tube%20station">Knightsbridge</a>. Both were under the control of <a href="Charles%20Yerkes">Charles Yerkes</a> through his Metropolitan District Electric Traction Company and, in June 1902, were transferred to Yerkes' new <a href="holding%20company">holding company</a>, the <a href="Underground%20Electric%20Railways%20Company%20of%20London">Underground Electric Railways Company of London</a> (UERL). Neither of the railways had carried out any construction, but the UERL obtained permission for new tunnels between Piccadilly Circus and Holborn to connect the two routes. The companies were formally merged as the <a href="Great%20Northern%2C%20Piccadilly%20and%20Brompton%20Railway">Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway</a> (GNP&BR) following parliamentary approval in November 1902. Prior to confirmation of the merger, the GN&SR had sought permission to extend its line southwards from the future junction of Kingsway and Aldwych, under Norfolk Street to a new interchange under the <a href="District%20Railway">Metropolitan District Railway's</a> station at <a href="Temple%20tube%20station">Temple</a>. The extension was rejected following objections from the <a href="Henry%20Fitzalan-Howard%2C%2015th%20Duke%20of%20Norfolk">Duke of Norfolk</a> under whose land the last part of the proposed tunnels would have run.

In 1903, the GNP&BR sought permission for a branch from Piccadilly Circus to run under <a href="Leicester%20Square">Leicester Square</a>, Strand, and <a href="Fleet%20Street">Fleet Street</a> and into the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a>. The branch would have passed and interchanged with the already approved Strand station, allowing travel on the GNP&BR from Strand in three directions. The deliberations of a <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a> on traffic in London prevented parliamentary consideration of the proposal, which was withdrawn.

In 1905, with the Royal Commission's report about to be published, the GNP&BR returned to Parliament with two bills for consideration. The first bill revived the 1903 proposal for a branch from Piccadilly Circus to the City of London, passing and interchanging with Strand station. The second proposed an extension and relocation of Strand station to the junction of Strand and Surrey Street. From there the line was to continue as a single tunnel under the River Thames to <a href="Waterloo%20tube%20station">Waterloo</a>. The first bill was again delayed and withdrawn. Of the second, only the relocation of Strand station was permitted.
The linking of the GN&SR and B&PCR routes meant that the section of the GN&SR south of Holborn became a branch from the main route. The UERL began constructing the main route in July 1902. Progress was rapid, so that it was largely complete by the Autumn of 1906. Construction of the Holborn to Strand section was delayed while the London County Council constructed Kingsway and the <a href="Kingsway%20tramway%20subway">tramway subway</a> running beneath it and while the UERL decided how the junction between the main route and the branch would be arranged at Holborn.

Strand station was built on the site of the <a href="Royal%20Strand%20Theatre">Royal Strand Theatre</a>, which had closed on 13 May 1905 and been demolished. Construction of the station began on 21 October 1905, to a design by the UERL's architect <a href="Leslie%20Green">Leslie Green</a> in the UERL house style of a two-storey steel-framed building faced with red glazed <a href="glazed%20architectural%20terra-cotta">terracotta</a> blocks, with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. The station building is L-shaped, with two façades separated by the building on the corner of Strand and Surrey Street. The Strand façade is narrow with a single semi-circular window above the entrance. The façade in Surrey Street is wider with a separate entrance and exit and a shop unit. In anticipation of a revival of the extension to Waterloo and the City route, the station was built with three circular lift shafts able to accommodate six <a href="trapezoid">trapezium</a>-shaped lifts. Only one of the shafts was fitted out, with two lifts. The other two shafts rose from the lower concourse to the basement of the station, but could have been extended upwards into the space of the shop unit when required. A fourth smaller-diameter shaft accommodated an emergency spiral stair.

The platforms are below street level and are long; shorter than the GNP&BR's standard length of . As with other UERL stations, the platform walls were tiled with distinctive patterns, in this case cream and dark green. Only parts of the platform walls were decorated because it was planned to operate the branch with short trains. Owing to the reduced lift provision, a second route between the platforms and lifts was never brought into use and was left in an unfinished condition without tiling.

The GNP&BR's main route opened on 15 December 1906, but the Strand branch was not opened until 30 November 1907. Initially, shuttle trains operated to Holborn from the eastern platform into the through platform at Holborn. At peak times, an additional train operated alternately in the branch's western tunnel into the bay platform at Holborn. During the first year of operation, a train for theatregoers operated late on Monday to Saturday evenings from Strand through Holborn and northbound to Finsbury Park; this was discontinued in October 1908.

In March 1908, the off-peak shuttle service began to use the western platform at Strand and the through platform at Holborn, crossing between the two branch tunnels south of Holborn. Low usage led to the withdrawal of the second peak-hour shuttle and the eastern tunnel was taken out of use in 1914. On 9 May 1915, three of the Underground stations in the area were renamed and Strand station became Aldwych. Sunday services ended in April 1917 and, in August of the same year, the eastern tunnel and platform at Aldwych and the bay platform at Holborn were formally closed. A German bombing campaign in September 1917 led to the disused platform being used as storage for around 300 paintings from the <a href="National%20Gallery">National Gallery</a> from then until December 1918.
In October 1922, the ticket office was replaced by a facility in the lifts. Passenger numbers remained low: when the station was one of a number on the network considered for closure in 1929, its annual usage was 1,069,650 and takings were £4,500. The branch was again considered for closure in 1933, but remained open.

Wartime efficiency measures led to the branch being closed temporarily on 22 September 1940, shortly after the start of <a href="The%20Blitz">The Blitz</a>, and it was partly fitted out by the <a href="City%20of%20Westminster">City of Westminster</a> as an <a href="air-raid%20shelter">air-raid shelter</a>. The tunnels between Aldwych and Holborn were used to store items from the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>, including the <a href="Elgin%20Marbles">Elgin Marbles</a>. The branch reopened on 1 July 1946, but patronage did not increase. In 1958, the station was one of three that <a href="London%20Transport%20Executive">London Transport</a> announced would be closed. Again it survived, but the service was reduced in June 1958 to run during Monday to Friday peak hours and Saturday morning and early afternoons. The Saturday service was withdrawn in June 1962.

After operating only during peak hours for more than 30 years, the closure announcement came on 4 January 1993. The original 1907 lifts required replacement at a cost of £3 million. This was not considered justifiable in relation to the passenger numbers using the station and it was losing <a href="London%20Regional%20Transport">London Regional Transport</a> £150,000 per year. The <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Transport">Secretary of State for Transport</a> granted permission on 1 September 1994 to close the station and the branch closed on 30 September. Recognising the station's historical significance as a mostly unaltered station from the early 20th century, the station was given Grade II <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> status in 2011.

Although the Piccadilly Circus to City of London branch proposal of 1905 was never revisited after its withdrawal, the early plan to extend the branch south to Waterloo was revived a number of times during the station's life. The extension was considered in 1919 and 1948, but no progress towards constructing the link was made.

In the years after the Second World War, a series of preliminary plans for relieving congestion on the London Underground had considered various east-west routes through the Aldwych area, although other priorities meant that these were never proceeded with. In March 1965, a <a href="British%20Railways%20Board">British Rail</a> and <a href="London%20Transport%20Board">London Transport</a> joint planning committee published "A Railway Plan for London", which proposed a new tube railway, the <a href="Fleet%20line">Fleet line</a> (later renamed the <a href="Jubilee%20line">Jubilee line</a>), to join the <a href="Bakerloo%20line">Bakerloo line</a> at then run via , , , Aldwych and into the City of London via , and before heading into south-east London. An interchange was proposed at Aldwych and a second recommendation of the report was the revival of the link from Aldwych to Waterloo. London Transport had already sought parliamentary approval to construct tunnels from Aldwych to Waterloo in November 1964, and in August 1965, parliamentary powers were granted. Detailed planning took place, although public spending cuts led to postponement of the scheme in 1967 before tenders were invited.

Planning of the Fleet line continued and parliamentary approval was given in July 1969 for the first phase of the line, from Baker Street to Charing Cross. Tunnelling began on the £35 million route in February 1972 and the Jubilee line opened north from Charing Cross in May 1979. The tunnels of the approved section continued east of Charing Cross under Strand almost as far as Aldwych station, but no work at Aldwych was undertaken and they were used only as sidings. Funding for the second phase of the work was delayed throughout the 1970s whilst the route beyond Charing Cross was reviewed to consider options for serving anticipated development in the <a href="London%20Docklands">London Docklands</a> area. By 1979, the cost was estimated as £325 million, a six-fold increase from the £51 million estimated in 1970. A further review of alternatives for the Jubilee line was carried out in 1980, which led to a change of priorities and the postponement of any further effort on the line. When the extension was eventually constructed in the late 1990s it took a different route, south of the River Thames via , and to provide a rapid link to , leaving the tunnels between and Aldwych redundant.

In July 2005, <a href="Arup%20Group%20Limited">Ove Arup & Partners</a> produced a report, "DLR Horizon 2020 Study", for the <a href="Docklands%20Light%20Railway">Docklands Light Railway</a> (DLR) examining "pragmatic development schemes" to expand and improve the DLR network between 2012 and 2020. One of the proposals was an extension of the DLR from to via and Aldwych. The disused Jubilee line tunnels would be enlarged to accommodate the larger DLR trains and Aldwych station would form the basis for a new station on the line, although requiring considerable reconstruction to accommodate escalators. The estimated cost in 2005 was £232 million for the infrastructure works and the scheme was described as "strongly beneficial" as it was expected to attract passengers from the London Underground's existing east-west routes and from local buses and reduce overcrowding at Bank station. The <a href="business%20case">business case</a> assessment was that the proposal offered high value, although similar values were calculated for other extension proposals from Bank. Further detailed studies were proposed.

In 2015, a scheme was proposed by the design firm <a href="Gensler">Gensler</a> to convert disused London Underground tunnels into subterranean <a href="rail%20trail">rail trail</a>s, enabling the disused branches of the Piccadilly line and Jubilee line to be used as cycle paths. The scheme, which would involve re-opening Aldwych station as an access point for cyclists, has not been officially approved.

Because it was a self-contained section of the London Underground that was closed outside weekday peak hours, Aldwych station and the branch line from Holborn were popular locations for filming scenes set on the Tube even before their closure. Since the branch's closure in 1994, its use in film productions has continued, with the station appearing as itself and, with appropriate signage, as other stations on the network. The track and infrastructure are maintained in operational condition, and a train of ex-<a href="Northern%20line">Northern line</a> <a href="London%20Underground%201972%20Stock">1972 tube stock</a> is permanently stabled on the branch. This train can be driven up and down the branch for filming. The physical connection with the <a href="Piccadilly%20line">Piccadilly line</a> northbound tracks remains, but requires manual operation.

Films and television productions that have been shot at Aldwych include:


The pre-war operation of the station features in a pivotal scene in <a href="Geoffrey%20Household">Geoffrey Household</a>'s novel "<a href="Rogue%20Male%20%28novel%29">Rogue Male</a>", when the pursuit of the protagonist by an enemy agent sees them repeatedly using the shuttle service on the branch line. A chase through Aldwych station ends with the agent's death by electrocution on the track. A much modified and expanded version of the station appears as a <a href="level%20%28video%20gaming%29">level</a> in the video game "<a href="Tomb%20Raider%20III">Tomb Raider III</a>". The music video for <a href="The%20Prodigy">The Prodigy</a>'s song "<a href="Firestarter%20%28The%20Prodigy%20song%29">Firestarter</a>" was filmed in the disused eastern tunnel and one of the unused lift shafts. The station was the subject of an episode of "<a href="Most%20Haunted">Most Haunted</a>" in 2002.
