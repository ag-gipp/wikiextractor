Norodom Ranariddh

Norodom Ranariddh (; born 2 January 1944) is a <a href="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>n royal politician and law academic. He is the second son of <a href="Norodom%20Sihanouk">Norodom Sihanouk</a> of Cambodia and a half-brother of the current king, <a href="Norodom%20Sihamoni">Norodom Sihamoni</a>. Ranariddh is the president of <a href="FUNCINPEC">FUNCINPEC</a>, a Cambodian royalist party. He was also the First <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Cambodia">Prime Minister of Cambodia</a> following the restoration of the <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Cambodia">monarchy</a>, serving between 1993 and 1997, and subsequently as the President of the <a href="National%20Assembly%20%28Cambodia%29">National Assembly</a> between 1998 and 2006.

Ranariddh was a graduate of the <a href="University%20of%20Provence">University of Provence</a> and started his career as a law researcher and lecturer in <a href="France">France</a>. In 1983, he joined FUNCINPEC and in 1986 became the chief of staff and commander-in-chief of <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Cambodia">Armée nationale sihanoukiste</a>. Ranariddh became Secretary-General of FUNCINPEC in 1989, and its president in 1992. When FUNCINPEC won the <a href="Cambodian%20general%20election%2C%201993">1993 Cambodian general election</a>, it formed a coalition government with the <a href="Cambodian%20People%27s%20Party">Cambodian People's Party</a> (CPP), which was jointly headed by two concurrently serving prime ministers. Ranariddh became the First Prime Minister of Cambodia while <a href="Hun%20Sen">Hun Sen</a>, who was from the CPP, became the Second Prime Minister. As the First Prime Minister, Ranariddh promoted business interests in Cambodia to leaders from regional countries and established the Cambodian Development Council (CDC).

From early 1996, relations between Ranariddh and Hun Sen deteriorated as Ranariddh complained of unequal distribution of government authority between FUNCINPEC and the CPP. Subsequently, both leaders publicly argued over issues such as the implementation of construction projects, signing of property development contracts, and their rival alliances with the <a href="Khmer%20Rouge">Khmer Rouge</a>. In July 1997, a major clash between troops separately aligned to FUNCINPEC and the CPP took place, forcing Ranariddh into exile. The following month, Ranariddh was ousted from his position as First Prime Minister. He returned to Cambodia in March 1998, and led his party in the <a href="Cambodian%20general%20election%2C%201998">1998 Cambodian general election</a>. When FUNCINPEC lost the elections to the CPP, Ranariddh, after initially challenging the results, became President of the National Assembly in November 1998. He was seen as a potential successor to Sihanouk as the King of Cambodia, until in 2001 he renounced his interest in the succession. As the President of the National Assembly, Ranariddh was one of the nine members of the <a href="Royal%20Council%20of%20the%20Throne">throne council</a> which in 2004 selected Sihamoni as Sihanouk's successor.

In March 2006, Ranariddh resigned as the President of the National Assembly and in October 2006 was ousted as President of FUNCINPEC. The following month, he founded the <a href="Norodom%20Ranariddh%20Party">Norodom Ranariddh Party</a> (NRP). After accusations of embezzlement and adultery he went into exile again, and in March 2007 was convicted "in absentia" of embezzlement and sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment. After being pardoned in September 2008 and returning to Cambodia, Ranariddh announced his retirement from politics, but resumed the NRP leadership in December 2010. He failed to merge the NRP and FUNCINPEC, and retired again, but in March 2014 re-emerged to launch the <a href="Community%20of%20Royalist%20People%27s%20Party">Community of Royalist People's Party</a> (CRPP). In January 2015, Ranariddh dissolved the CRPP and returned to FUNCINPEC. He was subsequently re-elected to the FUNCINPEC presidency.

Ranariddh was born in Phnom Penh to Sihanouk and his first wife, Phat Kanhol, who was a ballet dancer attached to the royal court. Ranariddh was separated from his mother at three years of age when she remarried, and subsequently grew up mostly under the care of his aunt, Norodom Ketkanya and grandaunt, Norodom Sobhana. Ranariddh attended primary education at Norodom School and completed part of his high school studies at Lycee Descartes in Phnom Penh. During his childhood, he developed a close relationship with his grandparents, <a href="Norodom%20Suramarit">Norodom Suramarit</a> and <a href="Sisowath%20Kossamak">Sisowath Kossamak</a>, but was distanced from his father. In 1958, Ranariddh was sent to a boarding school in <a href="Marseille">Marseille</a> together with his half-brother <a href="Norodom%20Chakrapong">Norodom Chakrapong</a>. Ranariddh initially planned to pursue medical studies as he did well in science subjects, but was persuaded by Kossamak to study law. After finishing high school in 1961, he enrolled in the undergraduate programme of law at the <a href="University%20of%20Paris">University of Paris</a>. He struggled to focus on his studies in Paris, which he attributed to the social distractions that he encountered in the city.

In 1962, Ranariddh enrolled in the law faculty at the University of Provence (now part of <a href="Aix-Marseille%20University">Aix-Marseille University</a>). He obtained his bachelor's and master's degrees in 1968 and 1969 respectively, specialising in <a href="public%20law">public law</a>. After completing his master's, Ranariddh took the PhD qualifying examinations in 1969. He returned to Cambodia in January 1970, and worked briefly as a secretary at the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Interior%20%28Cambodia%29">Interior Ministry</a>. When <a href="Lon%20Nol">Lon Nol</a> staged a successful coup against Sihanouk in March 1970, Ranariddh was dismissed from his job and fled into the jungle where he was a close associate of resistance leaders. In 1971, Ranariddh was captured, along with several members of the royal family, and was held in prison for six months before being released. He was rearrested the following year, and spent a further three months in detention. In 1973, Ranariddh returned to the University of Provence, where he completed his PhD in 1975. Between 1976 and 1979, he worked as a research fellow at the <a href="Centre%20national%20de%20la%20recherche%20scientifique">CNRS</a>, and was awarded a diploma of higher studies in air transport. In 1979 Ranariddh went back to the University of Provence as an <a href="Academic%20rank%20in%20France">associate professor</a>, teaching courses in <a href="constitutional%20law">constitutional law</a> and <a href="political%20sociology">political sociology</a>.

When Sihanouk formed FUNCINPEC in 1981, Ranariddh declined his father's invitation to join the party as he disagreed with its association with the <a href="Khmer%20Rouge">Khmer Rouge</a>. In June 1983, Sihanouk urged Ranariddh to leave his teaching career in France and join FUNCINPEC, and this time he agreed. Ranariddh was appointed as a personal representative to Sihanouk, and relocated to <a href="Bangkok%2C%20Thailand">Bangkok, Thailand</a>, where he took charge of the party's diplomatic and political activities in Asia. In March 1985, Ranariddh was appointed inspector-general of the Armee Nationale Sihanoukiste (ANS), the armed force of FUNCINPEC, and in January 1986 became ANS commander-in-chief and chief-of-staff.

Ranariddh became secretary-general of FUNCINPEC in August 1989, when Sihanouk stepped down as its president. On 10 September 1990, Ranariddh joined the Supreme National Council of Cambodia (SNC), an interim <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> administrative body tasked with overseeing sovereign affairs of Cambodia. When the <a href="1991%20Paris%20Peace%20Accords">1991 Paris Peace Accords</a> were signed in October of that year, officially ending the <a href="Cambodian%E2%80%93Vietnamese%20War">Cambodian–Vietnamese War</a>, Ranariddh was one of the SNC signatories. In February 1992, he was elected to the presidency of FUNCINPEC.

When the <a href="United%20Nations%20Transitional%20Authority%20in%20Cambodia">United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia</a> (UNTAC) – a parallel administrative body with the SNC – was formed in February 1992, Ranariddh was appointed as one of its council members. He spent time travelling between Bangkok and Phnom Penh, and while in Phnom Penh led efforts in opening FUNCINPEC party offices across Cambodia. At the same time, FUNCINPEC began to criticise the ruling CPP, which retaliated with violent attacks by police against low-level FUNCINPEC officials. The attacks prompted Ranariddh's close aides, Norodom Sirivudh and <a href="Sam%20Rainsy">Sam Rainsy</a>, to advise him against registering the party for the 1993 general elections. However, the chef-de-mission for UNTAC, <a href="Yasushi%20Akashi">Yasushi Akashi</a>, encouraged Ranariddh to run in the elections. Persuaded by Akashi, he registered the party and the election campaign began in April 1993. Ranariddh, as well as other FUNCINPEC officials, wore T-shirts depicting Sihanouk on the campaign trail. This nominally complied with an election rule by the UNTAC administration not to use Sihanouk's name during the campaign, who now served as the politically neutral head of the SNC. Voting took place in May 1993; FUNCINPEC secured about 45 percent of the valid votes, winning 58 out of a total of 120 parliamentary seats. The CPP refused to recognise the election results and complained of <a href="electoral%20fraud">electoral fraud</a>.

On 3 June 1993, CPP leaders <a href="Chea%20Sim">Chea Sim</a> and Hun Sen met with Sihanouk and persuaded him to head an interim government with the CPP and FUNCINPEC as joint coalition partners. That evening, Sihanouk announced the formation of the interim government over national radio. Ranariddh, who had not been consulted, expressed surprise. At the same time, the United States and China declared their opposition to the plan, prompting Sihanouk to rescind his announcement the following day. On 10 June 1993, CPP leaders led by General Sin Song and Chakrapong threatened to secede eight eastern provinces from Cambodia. Ranariddh feared a civil war with the CPP, which had a much larger army than the ANS. Accordingly, he accepted the idea of FUNCINPEC working with the CPP, and both parties agreed to a dual prime minister arrangement in the new government. On 14 June, Ranariddh presided over a parliamentary meeting which made Sihanouk the Head of State, with Hun Sen and Ranariddh serving as co-Prime Ministers in an interim government. A new constitution was drafted over the next three months, and was adopted in early September. On 24 September 1993, Sihanouk resigned as the head of state and was reinstated as King of Cambodia. In the new government, Ranariddh and Hun Sen were appointed as the First Prime Minister and Second Prime Minister, respectively.

<a href="Benny%20Widyono">Benny Widyono</a>, the UN secretary-general's representative in Cambodia from 1994 to 1997, has observed that although Ranariddh was nominally senior to Hun Sen, he held less executive power. Ranariddh initially viewed Hun Sen with suspicion, but the pair soon developed a close working relationship, agreeing on most policy decisions made until early 1996. In August 1993, while Cambodia was still under the administration of an interim government, Ranariddh and Hun Sen jointly applied to make the country a member in the <a href="International%20Organization%20of%20the%20Francophonie">International Organization of the Francophonie</a>. The decision to enter the Francophonie sparked a debate among students in higher educational institutes, particularly those from the <a href="Institute%20of%20Technology%20of%20Cambodia">Institute of Technology of Cambodia</a> who called for French to be replaced with English as the language of instruction. In response, Ranariddh encouraged students to simultaneously learn both English and French.

In August 1995, Ranariddh expressed admiration for the political and economic systems of Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. As he saw it, these countries, characterised by <a href="Illiberal%20democracy">hybrid regimes</a>, active <a href="economic%20interventionism">economic interventionism</a> and limited <a href="Freedom%20of%20the%20press">press freedom</a>, served as good models to propel Cambodia's socio-economic growth. Ranariddh espoused the view that economic development should take precedence over democratic and human rights. In the initial months of the administration, he actively courted political leaders from various regional countries, including Indonesia, <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> and Malaysia, with a view to encouraging investment in Cambodia. In early 1994, Ranariddh established the Cambodian Development Council (CDC) to encourage foreign investment, and served as its chairperson. The Malaysian Prime Minister, <a href="Mahathir%20Mohamad">Mahathir Mohamad</a>, supported Ranariddh's plans, and encouraged Malaysian businessmen to invest and assist in developing the tourism, infrastructural development and telecommunications industries.

As the chairman of the CDC, Ranariddh gave his approval to at least 17 business contracts submitted by Malaysian businessmen between August 1994 and January 1995. The projects mostly covered infrastructural development, and included construction of a racing track, power plants and petrol stations. In November 1994, the CDC opened a tender to build a casino near <a href="Sihanoukville%20%28city%29">Sihanoukville</a> and proposals submitted by three companies were shortlisted; Ariston Berhad from Malaysia, Unicentral Corporation from Singapore and Hyatt International from the US. Ariston's proposal was valued at USD 1.3 billion, and included bringing a luxury <a href="cruise%20ship">cruise ship</a> with casino to Cambodia, to be used to accommodate tourists until the Sihanoukville resort was built. Before the tender was even concluded, Ariston's ship was brought to Phnom Penh in early December. The Tourism Minister, <a href="Veng%20Sereyvuth">Veng Sereyvuth</a> suspected that there was backroom dealing activities between CDC and Ariston, who were nevertheless awarded the contract, which Ranariddh signed in January 1995.

In 1992, the UNTAC administration had banned forest logging and timber exports, a major industry and source of foreign earnings. In October 1993, Ranariddh issued an order to lift the ban on a temporary basis so as to allow trees that were already <a href="Felling">felled</a> to be exported for timber. The <a href="Khmer%20Rouge">Khmer Rouge</a> still controlled large tracts of forests in the regions of western and northern Cambodia bordering Thailand, and helped finance its operations by selling timber to Thai forestry companies. The Cambodian government was unable to impose its will in Khmer Rouge territory, and was eager to regain the logging revenues. In January 1994, Ranariddh and Hun Sen signed a <a href="bilateral%20agreement">bilateral agreement</a> with Thai Prime Minister <a href="Chuan%20Leekpai">Chuan Leekpai</a>. The agreement provided for felled trees to be legally exported to Thailand on a temporary basis until 31 March 1994. The agreement also arranged for specially-designated customs zones to be created within Thai territory, which allowed Cambodian custom officials to inspect the logs and collect export duties.

The logging ban went into force on 31 March 1994, but trees continued to be felled and a new stockpile of timber was created. Ranariddh and Hun Sen gave special authorisation for the lumber to be exported to <a href="North%20Korea">North Korea</a>. They would continue the practice of periodically lifting export bans and granting special approvals to clear stocks of fallen timber on an on-and off-basis until Ranariddh's ouster in 1997. According to Canadian geographer <a href="Philippe%20Le%20Billon">Philippe Le Billon</a>, Ranariddh and Hun Sen tacitly supported continued Khmer Rouge logging activities as it provided a lucrative backdoor source of cash revenue to finance their own political activities. Under Ranariddh's co-administration, Malaysia's Samling Berhad and Indonesia's Macro-Panin were among the largest beneficiaries of government contracts, as these two logging companies, in 1994–1995, secured rights to log 805,000 <a href="hectare">hectare</a>s and 1.4 million hectares of forests, respectively.

In October 1994, Ranariddh and Hun Sen dropped <a href="Sam%20Rainsy">Sam Rainsy</a> as Finance Minister during a cabinet reshuffle. Rainsy had been appointed by Ranariddh in 1993, but both prime ministers became uncomfortable working with Rainsy, because of his pursuit of allegations of government corruption. Rainsy's dismissal upset Norodom Sirivudh, who resigned as Foreign Minister the following month. In March 1995, during an academic forum on corruption in Cambodia, Rainsy publicly questioned Ranariddh's acceptance of a <a href="Fokker%20F28%20Fellowship">Fokker 28 airplane</a> and a US$108 million commission from Ariston Berhad. This angered Ranariddh, who expelled him from FUNCINPEC in May 1995. The following month, Ranariddh introduced a <a href="Motion%20%28parliamentary%20procedure%29">parliamentary motion</a> to remove Rainsy as a member of parliament (MP).

In 1995, Ranariddh made calls for <a href="Capital%20punishment">Capital punishment</a> by calling for murderers and drug traffickers to be killed by the State. 

From January 1996 onwards, Ranariddh's relations with Hun Sen began to show signs of tension. Hun Sen submitted a government circular to reinstate 7 January as a national holiday, the anniversary of Phnom Penh's liberation from the Khmer Rouge by Vietnamese forces. Ranariddh added his signature to the circular, which incurred the ire of Sihanouk and several FUNCINPEC leaders. A few days later, apparently to tone down dissatisfaction from party members, Ranariddh publicly accused the <a href="People%27s%20Army%20of%20Vietnam">Army of Vietnam</a> of encroaching into the territories of four Cambodian provinces bordering it. As Widyono saw it, Ranariddh intended to test Hun Sen's response to his accusations, of which the latter chose to remain quiet. During a closed-door FUNCINPEC meeting in the later part of January 1996, party members criticised Hun Sen and the CPP for monopolizing government power, and also chided Ranariddh for being too subservient to Hun Sen.

In February 1996, Ranariddh expressed concern over repeated delays in the construction of the resort-cum-casino complex at Sihanoukville, for which he had signed an agreement with Ariston in January 1995. Ariston blamed the lack of a governmental authority in Sihanoukville for the delay. At the end of April 1996, the government formed the Sihanoukville Developmental Authority (SDA) to oversee regulatory affairs and facilitate development. At a conference in May 1996, Ranariddh charged that CPP-controlled ministries were deliberately delaying the paperwork needed to complete the approval of Ariston's project. According to <a href="Tioulong%20Saumura">Tioulong Saumura</a>, the former deputy governor of Cambodia's Central Bank (and Sam Rainsy's wife), the delays were part of Hun Sen's strategy to undermine projects associated with Ranariddh. In an apparent act of retaliation, Ranariddh directed FUNCINPEC's co-minister of the interior, <a href="You%20Hockry">You Hockry</a> to close down all casinos in the country, citing the absence of authorising legislation. Ranariddh also proposed the cancellation of Ariston's contracts due to the delays. Hun Sen responded by meeting with Mahathir, and assured him that agreements which Ranariddh had previously approved would be honoured.

At a FUNCINPEC congress in March 1996, Ranariddh expressed unhappiness over his relationship with Hun Sen and the CPP. He likened his position as prime minister, and those of the FUNCINPEC ministers, to "puppets". He also questioned the CPP over their delays in appointing FUNCINPEC local officials as district chiefs. Ranariddh threatened to dissolve the National Assembly before the end of 1996, should FUNCINPEC's concerns remain unresolved. Several FUNCINPEC MPs, including Loy Sim Chheang and Ahmad Yahya, called on Ranariddh to reconcile with Sam Rainsy and work with the newly formed <a href="Sam%20Rainsy%20Party">Khmer Nation Party</a> (KNP) in the forthcoming general election. On 27 April Ranariddh, while vacationing in Paris, attended a meeting with Sihanouk, Rainsy, Chakrapong and Sirivudh. A few days later, Sihanouk issued a declaration praising Hun Sen and the CPP, while also stating that FUNCINPEC had no intention of leaving the coalition government. According to Widyono, Sihanouk's statement was an attempt to defuse the tension between Ranariddh and Hun Sen. Hun Sen rejected the king's conciliatory overtures, and responded by publishing several public letters attacking Sihanouk, Ranariddh and FUNCINPEC. At a CPP party meeting on 29 June 1996, Hun Sen chided Ranariddh for not following through on his March threat to leave the coalition government and called him a "real dog". At the same time, Hun Sen urged provincial governors from the CPP not attend Ranariddh's rallies.

In August 1996, Khmer Rouge leaders <a href="Pol%20Pot">Pol Pot</a> and <a href="Ieng%20Sary">Ieng Sary</a> publicly split, with the former denouncing the latter in a radio broadcast. Ieng Sary responded by disassociating himself from the Khmer Rouge and went on to form his own political party, the <a href="Democratic%20National%20Union%20Movement">Democratic National Union Movement</a>. Pol Pot's announcement prompted Ranariddh and Hun Sen to briefly set their political differences aside to jointly seek a royal pardon for Ieng Sary, who had been sentenced to death by the <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Kampuchea">People's Republic of Kampuchea</a> (PRK) government in 1979. Subsequently, in October and December 1996, both Ranariddh and Hun Sen competed to win Ieng Sary's favour by separately visiting the leader at his fiefdom in <a href="Pailin">Pailin</a>. Hun Sen gained the upper hand, when he announced at the end of his visit that he had managed to convince Khmer Rouge soldiers under Ieng Sary's charge to join the CPP. When Ranariddh announced plans for a follow-up to visit <a href="Samlout%20District">Samlout</a>, another town located within Ieng Sary's fiefdom, his soldiers threatened to shoot down Ranariddh's helicopter if he went there, prompting Ranariddh to cancel his visit.

In September 1996 Ariston Berhad signed three agreements with CPP's minister <a href="Sok%20An">Sok An</a>, without Ranariddh's knowledge or that of other FUNCINPEC ministers. The agreements provided for the leasing of land to Ariston to develop a golf course, holiday resort and an airport in Sihanoukville. These actions angered Ranariddh, who in a February 1997 letter to Ariston's president Chen Lip Keong, declared the agreements null and void. Subsequently, Ariston claimed that they had tried unsuccessfully to contact FUNCINPEC officials, with a view to getting them to jointly sign the agreements. Hun Sen was offended by Ranariddh's actions, and in April 1997 wrote to Mahathir assuring him of the validity of the agreements.

Ranariddh forged a political coalition by bringing FUNCINPEC to work together with the KNP, the <a href="Buddhist%20Liberal%20Democratic%20Party">Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party</a> and the Khmer Neutral Party. On 27 January 1997, the four political parties formalised their alliance, which became known as the "National United Front" (NUF). Ranariddh was nominated as the president of the NUF, and stated his intent to lead the alliance against the CPP, in the general elections scheduled to be held in 1998. The CPP issued a statement condemning NUF's formation, and formed a rival coalition consisting of political parties ideologically aligned to the former <a href="Khmer%20Republic">Khmer Republic</a>.

Meanwhile, Ranariddh stepped up his attacks against Hun Sen, accusing him of harbouring plans to restore a Communist regime should the CPP win the next general election. At the same time Ranariddh attempted to persuade moderate leaders of the Khmer Rouge, including <a href="Khieu%20Samphan">Khieu Samphan</a> and Tep Kunnal, to join the NUF. Khieu Samphan accepted Ranariddh's overtures, and on 21 May 1997, he announced that his party, the <a href="Khmer%20National%20Solidarity%20Party">Khmer National Solidarity Party</a> (KNSP) would support the NUF. Ranariddh welcomed Samphan's announcement, and on 4 June 1997, both leaders signed a communiqué pledging mutual support. Five days later, customs officials at Sihanoukville discovered a three-ton shipment of rocket launchers, assault rifles and handguns, labelled "spare parts" and consigned to Ranariddh. The rocket launchers were seized by <a href="Royal%20Cambodian%20Air%20Force">Cambodian Air Force</a> officers aligned to the CPP, while <a href="Royal%20Cambodian%20Armed%20Forces">Royal Cambodian Armed Forces</a> (RCAF) officials aligned to FUNCINPEC were allowed to keep the light weapons. In mid-June, Khmer Rouge radio, controlled by Khieu Samphan, broadcast a speech praising the KNSP-NUF alliance and calling for an armed struggle against Hun Sen. Fighting subsequently broke out between Ranariddh's and Hun Sen's bodyguards.

In response Hun Sen issued an ultimatum, calling for Ranariddh to make a choice between siding with the Khmer Rouge or with the coalition government. Eleven days later, he followed up by announcing that he would stop working with Ranariddh altogether. On 3 July 1997, while travelling to Phnom Penh, Ranariddh encountered troops aligned to the CPP. These troops persuaded his bodyguards to surrender their weapons, which prompted him to flee Cambodia the following day. On 5 July, fighting broke out between RCAF troops separately aligned to CPP and FUNCINPEC, after CPP-aligned generals unsuccessfully attempted to coax FUNCINPEC-aligned troops into surrendering their weapons. The FUNCINPEC-aligned units suffered major casualties the following day, and subsequently fled from Phnom Penh to the border town of <a href="O%20Smach">O Smach</a> in <a href="Oddar%20Meanchey%20Province">Oddar Meanchey Province</a>.

The defeat of FUNCINPEC-aligned troops in the military clashes on 6 July 1997 amounted to the effective ouster of Ranariddh. On 9 July 1997, the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20and%20International%20Cooperation%20%28Cambodia%29">Cambodian Foreign Ministry</a> issued a <a href="white%20paper">white paper</a> labelling Ranariddh a "criminal" and a "traitor", as well as accusing him of conspiring with the Khmer Rouge to destabilise the government. Ranariddh travelled to the Philippines, Singapore and Indonesia, where he met with <a href="Fidel%20Ramos">Fidel Ramos</a>, <a href="Goh%20Chok%20Tong">Goh Chok Tong</a> and <a href="Suharto">Suharto</a> to seek their help in his restoration. During his absence, at a party meeting on 16 July 1997, Ung Huot was nominated by FUNCINPEC MPs loyal to Hun Sen to replace Ranariddh as First Prime Minister. Huot was subsequently endorsed as First Prime Minister during a National Assembly sitting on 6 August 1997. A few days later, Sihanouk expressed his unhappiness over the clashes, and threatened to abdicate the throne and take over the premiership. Sihanouk also claimed that Ranariddh's ouster was unconstitutional, and initially refused to endorse Ung Huot's appointment, but later relented when <a href="Association%20of%20Southeast%20Asian%20Nations">Association of Southeast Asian Nations</a> (ASEAN) member states supported Ung Huot's appointment. In September 1997, the UN secretary general, <a href="Kofi%20Annan">Kofi Annan</a> met separately with Ranariddh and Hun Sen, to mediate the return of FUNCINPEC politicians and prepare for the <a href="Cambodian%20general%20election%2C%201998">1998 Cambodian general elections</a>. The UN proposed that its representatives monitor the elections, to which both Ranariddh and Hun Sen agreed, but Hun Sen insisted that Ranariddh be prepared to face court charges, to which Ranariddh responded with a threat to boycott the election.

At O Smach, FUNCINPEC-aligned troops fought along with the Khmer Rouge forces against CPP-aligned troops until February 1998, when a ceasefire brokered by the Japanese government came into effect. In March 1998, Ranariddh was convicted in absentia by a military court of illegally smuggling ammunitions in May 1997, and of colluding with the Khmer Rouge to cause instability in the country. He was sentenced to a total of 35 years' imprisonment, but this was nullified by a pardon from Sihanouk. Ranariddh returned to Cambodia at the end of March 1998 to lead FUNCINPEC's election campaign, which focused on pro-monarchical sentiments and anti-Vietnamese rhetoric. FUNCINPEC faced numerous obstacles, including lack of access to television and radio channels which had come under CPP's exclusive control following the 1997 clashes, and the difficulties of its supporters in getting to party rallies. In the vote on 26 July 1998, FUNCINPEC polled 31.7 percent and secured 43 out of a total of 122 parliamentary seats. The CPP won the elections by polling 41.4 percent of all votes and securing 64 parliamentary seats. The <a href="Sam%20Rainsy%20Party">Sam Rainsy Party</a> (SRP), Rainsy's renamed KNP, was in third place with 14.3 percent of the vote and 15 parliamentary seats.

Both Ranariddh and Rainsy protested against the election results, claiming that the CPP-led government had intimidated voters and tampered with ballot boxes. They filed petitions with the National Election Commission (NEC) and Constitutional Court; when these were rejected in August 1998, Ranariddh and Rainsy organised street protests to demand that Hun Sen relinquish power. The government responded on 7 September 1998, by banning street protests and cracking down on participants. At this point Sihanouk intervened, and arranged a summit meeting on 24 September 1998 in Siem Reap. He summoned Hun Sen, Ranariddh and Rainsy for discussions aimed at ending the political impasse. On the day of the summit meeting, a <a href="RPG-2">B40</a> rocket was fired from an <a href="RPG-2">RPG-2</a> rocket launcher at the direction of Hun Sen's motorcade, who was travelling en route to Siem Reap. The rocket missed the motorcade, and Hun Sen escaped unhurt. The police accused FUNCINPEC and SRP leaders of plotting the attack, with Rainsy as its ringleader. Both Ranariddh and Rainsy denied any involvement, but fled to Bangkok the following day, fearing government crackdowns on their parties.

Following Ranariddh's departure, Sihanouk urged him to return with a view to joining the CPP in a coalition government, reckoning that FUNCINPEC faced the prospect of breaking up if Ranariddh refused. Ranariddh returned to Cambodia on 12 November 1998 to attend a summit meeting hosted by Sihanouk, at which Ranariddh negotiated with Hun Sen and Chea Sim over the structure of a new government. An agreement was reached whereby FUNCINPEC would be given the National Assembly presidency together with several low and mid-level cabinet posts, in exchange for its support for the creation of the <a href="Senate%20%28Cambodia%29">Cambodian Senate</a>. On 25 November 1998, Ranariddh was nominated as the President of the National Assembly. According to Mehta, the creation of the Senate was to provide an alternative platform to pass legislation in the event that Ranariddh exerted his influence as the President of the National Assembly to block legislation.

After his appointment, Ranariddh worked with Hun Sen to re-integrate the FUNCINPEC-aligned troops into the RCAF. He also participated in efforts to foster better relations with Vietnam, and liaised with the <a href="National%20Assembly%20%28Vietnam%29">Vietnamese National Assembly president</a> <a href="N%C3%B4ng%20%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c%20M%E1%BA%A1nh">Nông Đức Mạnh</a> to develop friendship and cooperation initiatives. This led to several mutual visits between Cambodian and Vietnamese political leaders, between 1999 and 2000, but relations between Cambodia and Vietnam deteriorated from September 2000 onwards amid renewed border clashes. Ranariddh steered FUNCINPEC towards political rapprochement with the CPP, and actively discouraged FUNCINPEC ministers and MPs from criticising their CPP counterparts. During the party's congress in March 2001, Ranariddh declared the CPP an "eternal partner".

As early as 1999, a sizeable minority of FUNCINPEC's politicians were unhappy with Ranariddh's leadership, as rumours began to circulate that he had accepted bribes from the CPP. In February 2002, FUNCINPEC performed poorly in the <a href="Commune%20council">commune elections</a>, winning 10 out of 1,600 commune seats. As a result of FUNCINPEC's poor performance in the commune elections, rifts within the party boiled into the open. In March 2002, the Deputy Commander-in-chief of the RCAF – Khan Savoeun, accused You Hockry, the co-Minister of the Interior, of corruption and nepotism, acts which Savoeun claimed had alienated voters. When Ranariddh expressed support for Savoeun in May 2002, Hockry resigned. Around the same time, two new political parties, splintered from FUNCINPEC, were formed: the Khmer Soul Party, led by Norodom Chakrapong, and the Hang Dara Democratic Party, led by Hang Dara. Both new parties attracted sizeable numbers of FUNCINPEC defectors, who were apparently unhappy with Ranariddh's leadership. The defections caused Ranariddh to fear that FUNCINPEC would fare poorly in the 2003 general elections.

When <a href="Cambodian%20general%20election%2C%202003">general elections</a> were held in July 2003, the CPP won, while FUNCINPEC polled 20.8 percent of the popular vote and secured 26 out of a total of 120 parliamentary seats. This marked an 11 percentage point drop in FUNCINPEC's share of the popular vote compared with 1998. Both Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, whose SRP had also participated in the elections, expressed unhappiness with the outcome of the election, and once again accused the CPP of winning through fraud and voter intimidation. They also refused to support a CPP-led government, which needed the joint support of more MPs from FUNCINPEC or SRP to attain the <a href="Supermajority%23Two-thirds%20vote">two-thirds majority</a> in forming a new government. Subsequently, in August 2003, Ranariddh and Rainsy formed a new political alliance, the "Alliance of Democrats" (AD), and together they lobbied upon the CPP to form a three-party government consisting of the CPP, FUNCINPEC and the SRP. At the same time, they also called for Hun Sen to step down and a reform of the NEC, which they claimed was stacked with pro-CPP appointees. Hun Sen rejected their demands, bringing several months of political stalemate.

In March 2004, Ranariddh privately proposed to Hun Sen that FUNCINPEC should join CPP in the new government as a junior coalition partner. Discussions between CPP and FUNCINPEC began on the composition of the coalition government and legislative procedures. An agreement was reached in June 2004, when Ranariddh walked out of his alliance with Rainsy, dropped his demands to reform the NEC and once again pledged to support Hun Sen as Prime Minister. Hun Sen also pressured Ranariddh into supporting a constitutional amendment known as a "package vote", which required MPs to support legislation and ministerial appointments by an open show of hands. While Ranariddh acquiesced to Hun Sen's demand, the "package vote" amendment was opposed by Sihanouk, Chea Sim, the SRP as well as several senior leaders within FUNCINPEC. After the "package vote" amendment was passed in July 2004, several FUNCINPEC leaders resigned in protest. Ranariddh, who remained as President of the National Assembly as part of the agreement, attempted to lure SRP leaders into defecting to FUNCINPEC with the promise of jobs within the government. At least one senior SRP leader, Ou Bun Long, caved into Ranariddh's enticements.

On 2 March 2006, the National Assembly passed a constitutional amendment which required only a <a href="Majority">simple majority</a> of parliamentarians to support a government, instead of the two-thirds majority that was previously stipulated. Rainsy had first proposed the amendment in February 2006, who had hoped that a simple majority would make it easier for his party to form a government should they win in future elections. The following day after the constitutional amendment was passed, Hun Sen relieved Norodom Sirivudh and Nhek Bun Chhay of their posts as FUNCINPEC's co-minister of interior and co-minister of defense respectively. Ranariddh protested against the dismissals, and resigned as the President of the National Assembly on 14 March. He then left Cambodia, to reside in France. Shortly after his departure, local tabloids published stories that Ranariddh had had an affair with Ouk Phalla, an <a href="Apsara">Apsara</a> dancer.

In early September 2006, a new law was passed to outlaw adultery, and Ranariddh responded by accusing the government of attempting to undermine FUNCINPEC. On 18 September 2006, Hun Sen and Nhek Bun Chhay called for Ranariddh to be replaced as FUNCINPEC's president, after party reports suggested that Phalla had lobbied Ranariddh to appoint her relatives to government posts. On 18 October 2006, Nhek Bun Chhay convened a party congress which dismissed Ranariddh from his position as FUNCINPEC's president. In turn, he was given the titular position of "Historic President". At the congress, Nhek Bun Chhay justified Ranariddh's ouster on the grounds of his deteriorating relations with Hun Sen as well as his practice of spending prolonged periods of time overseas.

Following Ranariddh's exit from FUNCINPEC, Nhek Bun Chhay filed a lawsuit in November 2006, accusing Ranariddh of pocketing $3.6 million from the sale of its headquarters to the French embassy in 2005. In mid-November, Ranariddh returned to Cambodia, announced the formation of the <a href="Norodom%20Ranariddh%20Party">Norodom Ranariddh Party</a> (NRP) and became its president. The following month, the National Assembly expelled Ranariddh as an MP. Within days his wife, Eng Marie, sued him for adultery. Ranariddh's half-brother Chakrapong was also expelled from the party, and joined the NRP as the party's deputy president. In March 2007, Ranariddh was convicted by the Phnom Penh Municipal Court for embezzlement of the sale proceeds of FUNCINPEC headquarters, and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. To avoid imprisonment, Ranariddh sought asylum in Malaysia shortly before the sentencing.

While living in exile in Malaysia, Ranariddh communicated to NRP party members and supporters through telephone and video conferencing. In November 2007, he proposed a merger between the NRP, SRP and the <a href="Human%20Rights%20Party%20%28Cambodia%29">Human Rights Party</a>, to better their prospects against the CPP in the <a href="Cambodian%20general%20election%2C%202008">2008 general elections</a>. Rainsy, the leader of the SRP, rejected his proposal. When the election campaign began in June 2008, Ranariddh, though not able to enter the country, raised issues such as border disputes with Cambodia's neighbours, illegal logging, and promised to lower petrol prices. When voting took place in July, the NRP won two parliamentary seats. Immediately after the election, the NRP joined the SRP and the HRP in charging the Election Commission with irregularities. The NRP subsequently dropped their accusations, after Hun Sen brokered a secret deal with Ranariddh which allowed the latter to return from exile, in exchange for the NRP's recognition of the election results.

In September 2008, Ranariddh received a royal pardon from <a href="Norodom%20Sihamoni">Sihamoni</a> (who had succeeded to the throne in October 2004) for his embezzlement conviction, allowing him to return to Cambodia without risking imprisonment. Following his return, Ranariddh announced his retirement from politics and pledged to support the CPP-led government. After his retirement, Ranariddh dedicated most of his time to philanthropic work and supporting royal activities. In late 2010, NRP and FUNCINPEC leaders including Nhek Bun Chhay publicly called for Ranariddh to return to politics. Ranariddh initially resisted the calls, but changed his mind and announced his return in December 2010. For the next one-and-a-half years, Ranariddh and Nhek Bun Chhay negotiated for a merger between NRP and FUNCINPEC. An agreement was formalised in May 2012, whereby Ranariddh would be made the president of FUNCINPEC, while Nhek Bun Chhay would become its vice-president. The merger agreement was rescinded a month later, when Nhek Bun Chhay accused Ranariddh of supporting other opposition parties. Two months later, Ranariddh declared his retirement from politics for a second time, and tendered his resignation as the president of NRP.

In March 2014, Ranariddh renounced his retirement and launched a new political party, the <a href="Community%20of%20Royalist%20People%27s%20Party">Community of Royalist People's Party</a> (CRPP). <a href="Sam%20Rainsy">Sam Rainsy</a>, now president of the <a href="Cambodian%20National%20Rescue%20Party">Cambodian National Rescue Party</a> (CNRP), accused Ranariddh of intending to split the opposition vote to favour the ruling CPP in future elections. Ranariddh responded by accusing the CNRP of harbouring republican sentiments, while also stating that his motivation in launching CRPP was to reunite royalist supporters within the Cambodian electorate. The CRPP attracted support from some senior FUNCINPEC party members; in December 2014 an ex-secretary of state, a senator and a deputy police chief declared their support for the CRPP. Hun Sen then proposed to Ranariddh that he return to FUNCINPEC.

In early January 2015, Ranariddh announced his intention to dissolve the CRPP and return to FUNCINPEC. At a party congress on 19 January 2015, he was reappointed as FUNCINPEC president; his half-sister and previous FUNCINPEC president, <a href="Norodom%20Arunrasmy">Norodom Arunrasmy</a> became the first vice-president, while Nhek Bun Chhay was appointed as second vice-president. In March 2015, Ranariddh held another party congress where he appointed four more vice-presidents to the FUNCINPEC executive committee. He also convinced the congress to adopt a new party logo, which had a design almost identical that of the now-defunct CRPP. Ranariddh supported the formation of the Cambodian Royalist Youth Movement in July 2015, a youth organisation aimed at garnering electoral support for FUNCINPEC from <a href="Youth%20politics">younger voters</a>, which he was appointed as its honorary president. In November 2017, he returned to the National Assembly as a member of parliament, following the dissolution of the <a href="Cambodia%20National%20Rescue%20Party">Cambodia National Rescue Party</a>, after which the FUNCINPEC received 41 of the 55 vacated seats. The party performed poorly in the <a href="Cambodian%20general%20election%2C%202018">2018 general election</a>, failing to win a single seat in the National Assembly. Though they were runners-up behind the <a href="Cambodian%20People%27s%20Party">Cambodian People's Party</a>, their tally of popular vote was fewer than the 594,659 invalid ballots cast by disenfranchised supporters of the former opposition.

In June 1993 Ranariddh was granted the Cambodian royal title of "Sdech Krom Luong" (<a href="Khmer%20language">Khmer</a>: ស្ដេចក្រុមលួង), which translates as "Senior Prince" in English. Five months later, in November 1993, he was elevated to the rank of "Samdech Krom Preah" (<a href="Khmer%20language">Khmer</a>: សម្ដេចក្រុមព្រះ), or "Leading Senior Prince" in English, in recognition of his efforts to re-instate Sihanouk as the <a href="King%20of%20Cambodia">King of Cambodia</a>. Ranariddh has been a recipient of several awards from the palace; in December 1992 he was decorated as the Grand Officer of the Royal Order of Cambodia. In May 2001 he received the <a href="Grand%20Order%20of%20National%20Merit%20%28Cambodia%29">Grand Order of National Merit</a> and in October 2001 was awarded the Order of Sovatara, with the class of Mohasereivadh. He was also awarded the Grand Officer de l'Ordre de la Pleaide by the <a href="Organisation%20internationale%20de%20la%20Francophonie">La Francophonie</a> in March 2000.

In December 2008, Sihamoni appointed Ranariddh as President of the Supreme Privy Council of Cambodia, equivalent in rank to that of prime minister, and, during an interview in December 2010 Ranariddh revealed that this royal appointment entitles him to a monthly salary of three million riels (about <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US</a>$750).

Debates on the succession to the throne began in November 1993, shortly after Sihanouk was diagnosed with cancer. In a 1995 poll of 700 people conducted by the Khmer Journalists' Associations, 24 percent of respondents preferred Ranariddh to take the throne, although a larger proportion indicated no preference over any members of the royal family. In a March 1996 interview with the "<a href="Cambodia%20Daily">Cambodia Daily</a>", Sihanouk encouraged Ranariddh to succeed him as king, but also expressed concern that a leadership vacuum within FUNCINPEC would occur, should Ranariddh accede. Sihanouk repeated these concerns in an interview with the "Phnom Penh Post" in February 1997. Sihanouk mentioned Sihamoni as another potential candidate, despite the latter's view that the responsibilities attached to the throne were "frightening". Sihamoni's candidacy found favour with Hun Sen and <a href="Chea%20Sim">Chea Sim</a>, because of his non-involvement in politics.

In two reports from 1993 and 1996, Ranariddh rejected the notion of becoming the next king. In November 1997, Ranariddh suggested that his outspoken and passionate personality made him an unsuitable candidate for the throne. However, by March 1999 Ranariddh became more receptive to the idea of succeeding his father. In early 2001, in an interview to Harish Mehta, Ranariddh discussed his conflicting desires between taking the throne and staying in politics. In November 2001, Ranariddh told the "<a href="Cambodia%20Daily">Cambodia Daily</a>" that he had decided to prioritize his political career over the throne. In the same interview, he added that Sihamoni had in the past supported him to become the next king. In September 2004, Ranariddh revealed that although he had been offered the throne by both Sihanouk and <a href="Norodom%20Monineath">Monineath</a>, who was Sihamoni's mother, he would prefer to see Sihamoni take the throne. When the <a href="Royal%20Council%20of%20the%20Throne">throne council</a> convened in October 2004 to select Sihanouk's successor, Ranariddh was part of the council which unanimously chose Norodom Sihamoni to be the next king.

Ranariddh is known for his <a href="Heredity">physical resemblance</a> to his father Sihanouk, inheriting his facial features, high-pitched <a href="Vocal%20register">voice</a> and mannerisms. Contemporaries including Harish Mehta, <a href="Lee%20Kuan%20Yew">Lee Kuan Yew</a> and Benny Widyono have so stated after meeting with him. An opinion poll conducted in July 1997 by the Cambodian Information Centre also supports similar observations of Ranariddh's physical resemblance to Sihanouk. Journalists such as those from the "<a href="Phnom%20Penh%20Post">Phnom Penh Post</a>" have observed that Ranariddh had used his resemblance to canvass support for FUNCINPEC during the 1993 and 1998 general elections. Ranariddh acknowledged these observations during an interview with Mehta in 2001, saying:

"People adore the king and I look like him. It is not my achievement they are remembering, but the deeds of my father. On the contrary, if I fail the people would say 'Oh, you are the son, but you are not like your father'. It's rather a burden."

Ranariddh speaks <a href="Khmer%20language">Khmer</a>, French and English fluently. He also holds dual Cambodian and French citizenship, having obtained the latter in 1979. He enjoys listening to music and watching films, though in a 2001 interview he described himself as lacking the artistic talent which Sihanouk possessed. In 2002, Ranariddh produced and directed a 90-minute film, titled "Raja Bori", which was shot at <a href="Angkor%20Wat">Angkor Wat</a>.

Ranariddh has 12 half-siblings from his father by different wives; <a href="Norodom%20Buppha%20Devi">Norodom Buppha Devi</a> is his only full-sibling. Buppha Devi became a ballet dancer, like her mother Phat Kanhol had been during her younger days. Kanhol remarried in 1947 to a military officer, Chap Huot, and had five children with him. Phat Kanhol died from cancer in February 1969 at the age of 49, while Chap Huot was killed in an explosion a year later. Four of Ranariddh's half-siblings by his mother and Chap Huot were killed during the Khmer Rouge years, while one of them, Chap Nhalyvoud, survived. Chap Nhalyvoud served as the governor of Siem Reap Province between 1998 and 2004.

Ranariddh met his first wife, <a href="Norodom%20Marie">Eng Marie</a>, in early 1968. Marie was the eldest child of Eng Meas, an Interior Ministry official of <a href="Chinese%20Cambodian">Sino-Khmer</a> descent, and Sarah Hay, a Muslim of <a href="Cham%20people">Cham</a> ethnicity. Marie had nine younger siblings, and among them was <a href="Roland%20Eng">Roland Eng</a>, the former ambassador to Thailand and the United States. The couple married in September 1968 at the royal palace, and had three children: Chakravuth (born 1970), Sihariddh (born 1972) and Rattana Devi (born 1974). The couple separated, and Marie filed for divorce in March 2006 when Ranariddh's relationship with Ouk Phalla became known. The divorce was not finalised until June 2010. Ranariddh had two sons with Ouk Phalla: Sothearidh (born 2003) and Ranavong (born 2011). Phalla was a descendant of King <a href="Sisowath">Sisowath</a> and was a classical dancer. She met Ranariddh when the latter was producing and directing the film "Raja Bori".

On 17 June 2018, Ranariddh and Ouk Phalla were both seriously injured in a car accident en route to <a href="Sihanoukville%20Province">Sihanoukville Province</a>. Ouk Phalla died hours later as a result of her injuries.

Hurricane Iris

Hurricane Iris was a small, but powerful tropical cyclone that caused widespread destruction in <a href="Belize">Belize</a>. Iris was the second-strongest storm of the <a href="2001%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">2001 Atlantic hurricane season</a>, behind <a href="Hurricane%20Michelle">Hurricane Michelle</a>. It was the ninth <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20naming">named storm</a>, fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the year, forming from a <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a> on October 4 just southeast of <a href="Barbados">Barbados</a>. It moved westward through the Caribbean, intensifying into a tropical storm on October 5 south of Puerto Rico, and into a hurricane on the following day. While passing south of the Dominican Republic, Iris dropped heavy rainfall that caused landslides, killing eight people. Later, the hurricane passed south of Jamaica, where it destroyed two houses. On reaching the western Caribbean Sea, Iris <a href="rapid%20deepening">rapidly intensified</a> into a Category 4 on the <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20hurricane%20wind%20scale">Saffir–Simpson scale</a>. A small hurricane with an eye of only 7 mi (11 km) in diameter, Iris reached peak winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) before making <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> in southern Belize near <a href="Monkey%20River%20Town">Monkey River Town</a> on October 9. The hurricane quickly dissipated over Central America, although its remnants contributed to the formation of <a href="2001%20Pacific%20hurricane%20season%23Tropical%20Storm%20Manuel">Tropical Storm Manuel</a> in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The hurricane caused severe damage—destroying homes, flooding streets, and leveling trees—in coastal towns south of Belize City.

Destruction was heaviest in Belize and totaled $250 million (2001 <a href="United%20States%20dollar">USD</a>). Because Iris was compact, the damage was largely confined to 72% of the houses in the <a href="Toledo%20District">Toledo district</a> and 50% of the houses in the <a href="Stann%20Creek%20District">Stann Creek</a> <a href="Districts%20of%20Belize">district</a>. The hurricane damaged or destroyed 3,718 homes nationwide, and wrecked more than 95% of the homes in 35 villages in the poorest parts of the country. Iris left about 15,000 people homeless, many receiving assistance from the government and the local <a href="International%20Federation%20of%20Red%20Cross%20and%20Red%20Crescent%20Societies">Red Cross</a> chapter. High winds also damaged large swaths of forest and crops, mostly affecting the banana industry. Iris killed 24 people in Belize, including 20 who died when a scuba diving boat capsized near <a href="Big%20Creek%2C%20Belize">Big Creek</a>. The storm also killed eight people and damaged about 2,500 homes in neighboring Guatemala, and later dropped heavy rainfall in southern Mexico, where two people died.

Toward the end of September 2001, a poorly-defined <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a> moved westward across the tropical Atlantic Ocean, through an area of hostile <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a>, which was caused by a large <a href="cold-core%20low">upper-level low</a> within a <a href="trough%20%28meteorology%29">trough</a>, to the northeast of the <a href="Lesser%20Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a>. A few days later, the upper-level low detached from the trough and moved southwestward over the Caribbean Sea, allowing for an upper-level <a href="ridge%20%28meteorology%29">ridge</a>, or high-pressure area, to form over the tropical wave. The change provided a favorable environment for <a href="Tropical%20cyclogenesis">tropical development</a>, and an area of <a href="convection%20%28meteorology%29">convection</a> soon blossomed along the wave's axis. As the tropical wave approached the Lesser Antilles, a mid-level <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%23physical%20structure">wind circulation</a> formed within the deepest part of the convection, and a low-level circulation became gradually more pronounced on satellite imagery. Although its low-level circulation was small and poorly defined, the system increased in organization enough to be classified as Tropical Depression Eleven at 12:00 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a> on October 4, located about 100 mi (160 km) southeast of <a href="Barbados">Barbados</a>. Operationally, however, <a href="Hurricane%20Hunters">Hurricane Hunters</a> did not confirm the depression's formation until nine hours later.

In its early stages, the depression moved west-northwestward between the islands of <a href="St.%20Vincent%20%28island%29">St. Vincent</a> and <a href="St.%20Lucia">St. Lucia</a> under the influence of a strong ridge to its north. Compared to its appearance 24 hours before forming, the depression exhibited improved <a href="outflow%20%28meteorology%29">outflow</a> and more distinct convection, although its lower circulation remained very poorly organized. This was confirmed by a Hurricane Hunters flight into the system, which failed to report a closed circulation despite the depression's well-organized appearance on satellite imagery. At 21:00 UTC on October 5, they reported a strengthening circulation with flight-level winds of 74 mph (119 km/h), corresponding to a surface wind intensity of 60 mph (95 km/h). Based on these data, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Iris, situated about 155 mi (250 km) south of the southern coast of Puerto Rico. In post-season analysis, the <a href="National%20Hurricane%20Center">National Hurricane Center</a> (NHC) estimated that Iris had attained tropical storm status about nine hours earlier.
Despite the storm's intensification and well-organized satellite appearance, the circulation failed to become better defined. In their first discussion on Iris, the NHC mentioned the potential for the system to degenerate into a tropical wave if it maintained its fast forward speed. One forecaster noted that the center was fragile and that the cyclone could dissipate quickly if it encountered stronger wind shear to its south. Although its overall appearance did not change significantly, the Hurricane Hunters reported a closed <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a> with a diameter 23 mi (37 km) and a <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">stadium effect</a> (eyewall curvature) on October 6. Later that day, Iris reached hurricane strength just southwest of the southern tip of the <a href="Dominican%20Republic">Dominican Republic</a>, and the NHC remarked that land interaction with the Greater Antilles was the only factor impeding further development. After Iris reached winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) early on October 7, its intensity remained steady for about 24 hours. During that time, the satellite appearance became slightly ragged as its outflow became restricted, possibly due to an <a href="cold-core%20low">upper-level low</a>. By late on October 7, the area of hurricane force winds associated with Iris extended only 25 mi (35 km) from its 16 mi (22 km) wide eye.

Early on October 8, after turning west-southwestward away from the Greater Antilles, Iris began strengthening again, with warm waters and an absence of significant wind shear. The NHC predicted peak winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) before the storm would hit Belize. It <a href="rapid%20deepening">rapidly intensified</a> with the favorable conditions, intensifying from 95 mph (150 km/h) to 140 mph (225 km/h) in a 12-hour period on October 8, making Iris a <a href="List%20of%20Category%204%20Atlantic%20hurricanes">Category 4 hurricane</a> on the <a href="Saffir-Simpson%20Hurricane%20Scale">Saffir-Simpson scale</a>; in the same duration, the <a href="Atmospheric%20pressure">minimum central pressure</a> dropped 38 <a href="bar%20%28unit%29">mbar</a> (1.12 <a href="Inch%20of%20mercury">inHg</a>). While intensifying, the hurricane developed <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29%23Eyewall%20replacement%20cycles">concentric eyewalls</a>, with an innermost eye having a diameter of 7 mi (11 km). For comparison, the smallest known eye diameter on record for an Atlantic hurricane was about 3 mi (5 km), during <a href="Hurricane%20Wilma">Hurricane Wilma</a> in 2005. With such a small eye, a Hurricane Hunters flight could not deploy a <a href="dropsonde">dropsonde</a> into the center of Iris, and shortly after the flight, the innermost eye collapsed as the core paralleled the Honduras coastline just offshore. This resulted in a temporary and slight weakening during an <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29%23Eyewall%20replacement%20cycles">eyewall replacement cycle</a>, but within a few hours Iris re-intensified to attain peak winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) just off Belize. At 02:00 UTC on October 9, it made <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> at peak intensity in <a href="Monkey%20River%20Town">Monkey River Town</a> in the southern portion of Belize. Operationally, it was assessed as having made landfall with winds of 150 mph (240 km/h), though for an unknown reason this was lowered in post-analysis. 

Initially, Hurricane Iris was forecast to remain a tropical cyclone while crossing <a href="Central%20America">Central America</a> and to re-intensify in the eastern Pacific Ocean; had it done so, it would have retained the name Iris. Instead, the hurricane rapidly weakened after moving into the mountainous terrain of Guatemala, and within six hours of landfall, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm. Late on October 9, within sixteen hours of landfall, the storm's circulation dissipated over extreme southeastern Mexico. As the remnants approached the Pacific Ocean, a new area of convection developed south of the original circulation of Iris. It gradually organized while continuing westward, developing into <a href="2001%20Pacific%20hurricane%20season%23Tropical%20Storm%20Manuel">Tropical Storm Manuel</a>; the new storm ultimately lasted until October 18, before succumbing to cooler waters and wind shear.

Over a stretch of four days, sixteen <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20watches%20and%20warnings">tropical cyclone watches and warnings</a> were issued in association with Iris, affecting the Dominican Republic, the <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>n provinces of <a href="Granma%20Province">Granma</a> and <a href="Santiago%20de%20Cuba%20Province">Santiago de Cuba</a>, Jamaica, <a href="Cayman%20Islands">Cayman Islands</a>, the <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20Peninsula">Yucatán Peninsula</a>, <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>, <a href="Honduras">Honduras</a> and <a href="Belize">Belize</a>. The threat from Iris prompted the Jamaica National Emergency Operations Center to be activated. Shelters were opened in the country but were ultimately unused.

In Belize, a hurricane warning was issued about 23 hours before Iris moved ashore. A state of national emergency was declared on October 8 as Hurricane Iris neared landfall. All emergency response committees were activated to quickly begin recovery efforts. A mandatory evacuation was issued for Stann Creek and Toledo coastal villages and all offshore islands. The main hospital in Belize City was evacuated as a precaution and the city itself was placed under a voluntary evacuation order. Overall, 11,380 people evacuated their homes in Belize, including many in <a href="Belize%20City">Belize City</a>. These evacuations were later credited for limiting the death toll. <a href="Hurricane%20Keith">Hurricane Keith</a> had struck the nation a year prior, preparing some citizens for what to expect. Disaster response teams arrived the day after Iris was projected to make landfall. Pan American Health Organization staff were on standby in Belize, Guatemala and Honduras and were ready to respond to any post-storm disease outbreaks.

On October 8, the Government of Honduras declared a red alert for all northern regions, advising residents to expect "extreme weather conditions". About 5,000 people in the country evacuated from their homes. To the north of Belize, officials in Mexico evacuated people from fishing villages and closed ports.

While Iris was in its development stages, residents as far north as <a href="Saint%20Thomas%2C%20U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands">Saint Thomas</a> reported rain and thunderstorms. In the Dominican Republic, Iris dropped around of rainfall along the coast, forcing 35 families to evacuate their homes after rivers exceeded their banks. The rains triggered a landslide outside of <a href="Santo%20Domingo">Santo Domingo</a> that destroyed a home, killing a family of three. There was another landslide in the region that injured two people. Iris's passage near Jamaica destroyed two houses and damaged the roofs of two others, causing one injury. Otherwise, damage in the country was minimal.

A <a href="scuba%20diving">scuba diving</a> boat overturned during the hurricane near <a href="Big%20Creek%2C%20Belize">Big Creek, Belize</a>, possibly hit by a tornado. The boat, named the "Wave Dancer", had 28 people on board, including 20 from the Richmond Dive Club out of <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a>; most of them were upstairs in the boat, and none were diving. The captain had delayed returning to shore, and the passengers waited for the storm to pass along a dock, not anticipating the ferocity. Iris cut the ropes connecting the boat to the dock, causing it to overturn in waters. Eight people survived, and 11 bodies were recovered; it was presumed that 20 people died during the wreck, including 15 from the Richmond area and three crew members.

Another boat, the "Vendera", also reportedly capsized with people on board.

Hurricane Iris moved ashore in Belize with winds of , although the highest measured winds were at a station in Big Creek. Because of its small diameter, Iris produced heavy damage only in a area of southern Belize. In that region, the hurricane produced a <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a> of up to , with waves of over in height, causing street flooding and some damage to the offshore cayes.

As it moved ashore, Iris damaged houses and schools in dozens of villages. In 35 villages, the storm destroyed more than 95% of the buildings. Its small size confined the worst damage largely to <a href="Toledo%20District">Toledo</a> and <a href="Stann%20Creek%20District">Stann Creek</a> <a href="Districts%20of%20Belize">districts</a>, which are the two southernmost and poorest districts of the country. The percentage of damaged houses was 72% in Toledo district and about 50% in Stann Creek, leaving about 15,000 people homeless. In both districts, the storm caused power outages and contaminated water supplies. In the worst-affected areas, poor Mayan people living on farms lost much of what they owned. At <a href="Placencia">Placencia</a> near the coast, about 80% of the homes were destroyed and many of the remaining buildings had roof damage, with downed power poles in the streets. About 90% of the houses in nearby Seine Bight were destroyed, and where Iris made landfall, over 90% of the homes were destroyed throughout Monkey River Town. The storm damaged several roads and fishing piers in southern Belize. Iris also damaged tourism facilities, including minor impact to the <a href="Maya%20ruins%20of%20Belize">Maya ruins of Belize</a>, and damaged 20% of the hotel rooms in the country, accounting for $37 million in losses. The remainder of the country remained generally unaffected during the storm.

In southern Belize, the storm's strong winds left crop damage, in some cases where the harvest had just begun. About of bananas were destroyed, along with over of rice, of corn, and other crops to a lesser degree. The storm also flooded fields and killed several livestock. The shrimp industry lost 25% of its catch, partly due to contaminated waters. Crop damage in Belize was estimated at $103 million, mostly from banana losses. Iris's strong winds also damaged large swaths of forest, with upwards of 40% of trees affected in some areas. This disrupted the habitats of several animals, and it is likely that many of the <a href="howler%20monkey">howler monkey</a>s near Monkey River were killed. The storm's strong waves eroded the beach, although marine effects were much less than those of Hurricane Keith in the previous year. Nevertheless, there were reports of <a href="Fish%20kill">fish die-offs</a> after the storm, possibly from low oxygen due to too much decaying matter.

Nationwide, Iris damaged or destroyed 3,718 homes, directly affecting a total of 21,568 people, or 8.5% of the total population. The storm damaged or destroyed 31 schools and 17 health facilities, along with 21 government buildings. There was about $25 million in damage to the transportation sector, including highways and bridges. Iris killed 24 people in and around the country, including the victims of the "Wave Dancer" shipwreck. Overall damage was estimated at $250 million, making it the most damaging storm in the country since <a href="Hurricane%20Hattie">Hurricane Hattie</a> in 1961.

High tides and heavy rainfall caused power outages across both Guatemala and Honduras. In the former, the hurricane's rainfall generally amounted to , triggering flash flooding and landslides that injured nearly 100 people. The damage was heaviest in <a href="Pet%C3%A9n%20Department">Petén Department</a> in the northern portion of the country. The storm damaged 26 schools and 2,500 homes in the country's interior. An estimated 27,500 people were affected by the storm throughout Guatemala. There were eight deaths in the country, two of them the result of falling trees.

The remnants of Iris dropped heavy rainfall over southern Mexico, accumulating 4.80 in (122 mm) in the southern state of <a href="Chiapas">Chiapas</a>. In <a href="Oaxaca">Oaxaca</a>, the storm produced heavy rains and damaged a total of 120 houses. A mudslide in one village demolished 20 homes and killed a child, while elsewhere in the state a man drowned after being swept away in a flooded river.

On October 9, the government of Belize issued the "all clear" signal, indicating that the storm had fully passed, and began reconstruction efforts and damage assessment. The government declared Stann Creek and Toledo districts as disaster areas, and officials declared a nighttime curfew. By the day after the storm struck, the airport in Belize City had been reopened, and transportation in all but the southern portion of the country returned to normal. Residents in the southern part of the country lost access to fresh water, forcing them to drink unclean water. Officials sent medical teams to southern Belize in the most affected areas. The <a href="Belmopan">Belmopan</a> Red Cross issued an appeal for residents to donate money, clothing, and food for storm victims. The Red Cross also set up shelters and gave food to more than 7,000 people. By October 19, most roads in southern Belize were reopened. The Belize government printed a new postage stamp to help pay for reconstruction costs, and officials authorized spending $1.2 million to rebuild damaged homes. To assist the farmers who lost crops, the Belize government provided of maize seeds, as well as fertilizer. After the storm, the World Food Programme and the Belize Red Cross collectively provided food for the 9,000 families in need of subsidence. By October 31, the Red Cross had provided blankets, tarps, and hygienic supplies to 4,800 people severely affected by the storm. Homes were gradually repaired, and crop production returned to normal by early 2002. Around Christmas of 2001, the Belize Red Cross provided presents to school children in 14 villages affected by the storm. The lost banana crop caused sales to decrease by 22% in 2002, although sales gradually recovered.

The government of Belize issued an appeal to the international community for assistance in the days following Iris's landfall, and various countries provided aid. The United Kingdom sent a helicopter to assist in damage assessment and a crew to clean the water. The United States also sent a crew for damage assessment and donated plastic sheeting. Although sustaining significant damage, the Government of Guatemala deployed a working team with members from throughout the country to assist in recovery in Belize. Mexico sent blankets, mattresses, food, and water, as well as a medical team. The Japanese government sent tents and blankets, and the Chinese government donated of rice and dried fruits. Various United Nations departments donated about $225,000.

The American victims of the "Wave Dancer" boat wreck were flown back to the Richmond, Virginia area following the storm. The insurance company covering the boat reached a $4 million settlement, which was disbursed among the survivors and the victims' families. The boat operator remained in business following the accident.

Following the major damage in Belize, the name "Iris" was retired in the spring of 2002 by the <a href="World%20Meteorological%20Organization">World Meteorological Organization</a> and will never again be used for an <a href="North%20Atlantic%20tropical%20cyclone">Atlantic hurricane</a>. The name was subsequently replaced by the name "<a href="Hurricane%20Ingrid">Ingrid</a>" and was first used during the <a href="2007%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">2007 season</a>.

Japanese battleship Ise

Despite the expensive reconstruction, the ship was considered obsolete by the eve of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a>, and did not see significant action in the early years of the war. Following the loss of most of the IJN's large <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a> in mid-1942, she was rebuilt with a <a href="flight%20deck">flight deck</a> replacing the rear pair of <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s to give her the ability to operate an air group of <a href="floatplane">floatplane</a>s; lack of aircraft and qualified pilots meant that "Ise" never actually operated her aircraft in combat. She participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Leyte%20Gulf%23Battle%20off%20Cape%20Enga%C3%B1o%20%2825%E2%80%9326%20October%201944%29">Battle off Cape Engaño</a> in late 1944, where she was one of the ships that decoyed the American carrier fleet supporting the <a href="Battle%20of%20Leyte">invasion of Leyte</a> away from the landing beaches. Afterwards the ship was transferred to <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>; in early 1945 "Ise" participated in <a href="Operation%20Kita">Operation Kita</a>, where she transported <a href="petrol">petrol</a> and other strategic materials to Japan. The ship was then reduced to <a href="Reserve%20fleet">reserve</a> until she was sunk by American airstrikes in July. After the war "Ise" was <a href="ship%20breaking">scrapped</a> in 1946–1947.

The "Ise" class was designed as an improved version of the preceding . The ships had a length of <a href="length%20overall">overall</a>, a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draught</a> of at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>. They displaced at <a href="Displacement%20%28ship%29%23Standard%20displacement">standard</a> load and at deep load, roughly more than the earlier ships. Their crew consisted of 1,360 officers and <a href="naval%20rating">ratings</a>.

During the ships' modernisation in the 1930s, their forward <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a> was enlarged with multiple platforms added to their <a href="tripod%20mast">tripod mast</a>s to create a pagoda mast. Both ships were also given <a href="torpedo%20bulge">torpedo bulge</a>s to improve their underwater protection and to compensate for the weight of the extra armour. These changes increased their overall length to , their beam to and their draught to . Their displacement increased by over to at deep load. The crew now numbered 1,376 officers and enlisted men.

The "Ise"-class ships had two sets of direct-drive <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s, each of which drove two <a href="propeller%20shaft">propeller shaft</a>s, using steam provided by 24 <a href="Kampon">Kampon</a> Ro Gō <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s. The turbines were designed to produce a total of and give the ships a speed of . "Ise" reached from during her <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s. Each of the boilers consumed a mixture of coal and oil and the ships carried enough of both to give them a range of at a speed of .

During their 1930s modernisation, the boilers on each ship were replaced by eight new Kampon oil-fired boilers. The turbines were replaced by four geared Kampon turbines with a designed output of intended to increase their speed to . On her trials, "Ise" reached a top speed of from . The fuel storage of the ships was increased, which gave them a range of at a speed of , despite the additional weight.

The twelve <a href="Vickers%2014%20inch/45%20naval%20gun">Type 41</a> guns of the "Ise" class were mounted in three pairs of twin-gun, <a href="superfire">superfiring</a> turrets that were numbered one through six from front to rear. The first pair was forward of the main superstructure, the second pair was <a href="amidships">amidships</a>, and the last ones were aft of the rear superstructure. The ships' <a href="Battleship%20secondary%20armament">secondary armament</a> consisted of twenty <a href="14%20cm/50%203rd%20Year%20Type%20naval%20gun">Type 3 guns</a> in single mounts. Eighteen of these were mounted in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s in the <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a> and superstructure and the remaining pair were mounted on the deck above them and protected by <a href="gun%20shield">gun shield</a>s. <a href="Anti-aircraft%20defence">Anti-aircraft defence</a> was provided by four <a href="8%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bcm/40%203rd%20Year%20Type%20naval%20gun">3rd Year Type 8-centimetre (3 in)</a> <a href="anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft (AA) guns</a> in single mounts. The ships were also fitted with six submerged <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, three on each <a href="broadside">broadside</a>.

In 1931–1933 the AA guns were replaced with eight <a href="12.7%20cm/40%20Type%2089%20naval%20gun">Type 89</a> <a href="dual-purpose%20gun">dual-purpose gun</a>s, placed beside the forward superstructure in four twin-gun mounts. Two twin-gun mounts for licence-built <a href="Vickers">Vickers</a> <a href="QF%202%20pounder%20naval%20gun">two-pounder ()</a> light AA guns were also added, while the pair of 14 cm guns on the upper deck were removed.

During the mid-1930s reconstruction, the torpedo tubes were removed and the Vickers two-pounders were replaced by twenty licence-built <a href="25%20mm%20Hotchkiss%20anti-aircraft%20gun">Hotchkiss</a> <a href="Type%2096%2025%20mm%20AT/AA%20Gun">Type 96</a> light AA guns in 10 twin-gun mounts. This was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II, but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon. According to historian Mark Stille, the twin and triple mounts "lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets; the gun exhibited excessive vibration; the magazine was too small, and, finally, the gun produced excessive muzzle blast". During the reconstruction the forward pair of 14-centimetre guns in the forecastle were removed and the maximum elevation of the remaining guns was increased to +30 degrees.

The "Ise"-class ships' <a href="waterline">waterline</a> <a href="belt%20armor">protective belt</a> had a maximum thickness of of <a href="Vickers%20cemented%20armour">Vickers cemented armour</a> amidships; below it was a <a href="strake">strake</a> of armour. The upper armoured <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> consisted of two layers of <a href="high-tensile%20steel">high-tensile steel</a> totaling thick and the lower armoured deck also consisted of two layers of high-tensile steel, but only thick in total. The turrets were protected with an armour thickness of on the face and 76 mm on the roof. The casemate armour was thick and that of the <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s was 299 mm thick rather than the originally planned 305 mm.

While the details of the ship's fire-control instruments are not fully available, it is known that "Ise" was fitted with a <a href="Director%20%28military%29">gunnery director</a> after completion. In the late 1920s the <a href="fire-control%20system">fire-control system</a>s were upgraded and additional platforms were added to the foremast to accommodate them. A pair of directors for the 12.7 cm AA guns were added in the early 1930s, one on each side of the forward superstructure. The fire-control systems were again upgraded in the mid-1930s and directors were added for the 2.5 cm AA guns. The ship had a <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a> installed at the top of the pagoda mast at that time. <a href="List%20of%20Japanese%20World%20War%20II%20radar%23Shipborne%20radar">Type 21</a> air-search <a href="radar">radar</a>s were installed aboard the ship in mid-1942.

"Ise" was briefly fitted with an aircraft <a href="flight%20deck">flying-off platform</a> for a <a href="Mitsubishi%201MF">Mitsubishi 1MF</a>3 fighter on Turret No. 2 in 1927. It was replaced by a platform on Turret No. 5 for a <a href="Yokosuka%20E1Y">Yokosuka E1Y</a> <a href="reconnaissance%20aircraft">reconnaissance</a> <a href="floatplane">floatplane</a> in 1928–1929. A <a href="aircraft%20catapult">catapult</a> and a collapsible <a href="crane%20%28machine%29">crane</a> were fitted on the stern during the mid-1930s modernisation, and the ship was equipped to operate three floatplanes, although no <a href="hangar">hangar</a> was provided. The initial <a href="Nakajima%20E4N">Nakajima E4N2</a> biplanes were replaced by <a href="Nakajima%20E8N">Nakajima E8N2</a> biplanes in 1938.

"Ise", <a href="Japanese%20ship-naming%20conventions">named</a> after <a href="Ise%20Province">Ise Province</a>, one of the traditional provinces of Japan, was <a href="laid%20down">laid down</a> at the <a href="Kawasaki%20Heavy%20Industries">Kawasaki Heavy Industries</a> shipyard in <a href="Kobe">Kobe</a> on 5 May 1915 and <a href="Ceremonial%20ship%20launching">launched</a> on 12 November 1916. <a href="Captain%20%28naval%29">Captain</a> <a href="Akizawa%20Yoshima">Akizawa Yoshima</a> assumed command on 1 December and the ship was completed on 15 December 1917, too late for service in World War I. "Ise" was assigned to the 1st <a href="Division%20%28naval%29">Division</a> of the <a href="1st%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">1st Fleet</a> in 1917–1918. Captain <a href="Kuwashima%20Shozo">Kuwashima Shozo</a> relieved Akizawa on 1 December 1918 and he was relieved in his turn by Captain <a href="Furukawa%20Hiroshi">Furukawa Hiroshi</a> on 20 November 1919. On 29 August 1920, the ship began the first of numerous patrols off the <a href="Siberian">Siberian</a> coast and in northern waters in support of Japan's <a href="Siberian%20Intervention">Siberian Intervention</a> against the <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a> <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a>. Captain <a href="Yokoo%20Hisashi">Yokoo Hisashi</a> replaced Furukawa on 20 November and he was replaced by Captain Nagasawa Naotaro in his turn on 1 December 1921.

On 12 April 1922, while at <a href="Yokohama">Yokohama</a>, "Ise" hosted a delegation which included the <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a> (the future <a href="King%20Edward%20VIII">King Edward VIII</a>), who was accompanied by his <a href="second%20cousin">second cousin</a>, the future <a href="Louis%20Mountbatten%2C%201st%20Earl%20Mountbatten%20of%20Burma">Lord Mountbatten of Burma</a>. Captain Kanna Norikazu relieved Nagasawa on 1 December. The ship aided survivors of the <a href="1923%20Great%20Kant%C5%8D%20earthquake">Great Kantō earthquake</a> in September 1923. From the early 1920s through the late 1930s, "Ise" mostly cruised off the coast of <a href="Republic%20of%20China%20%281912%E2%80%931949%29">China</a>. Little detailed information is available about her activities during the 1920s, although she helped sink the obsolete <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> during gunnery training on 10 August 1926. The ship was <a href="wikt%3Aoverhaul">overhauled</a> in 1928–1929, during which her forward superstructure was enlarged and her aviation facilities improved.

Between 20 November 1931 and 10 February 1932, "Ise" had her anti-aircraft armament entirely replaced, her forward superstructure was further enlarged so that it became a <a href="pagoda%20mast">pagoda mast</a>, and her stern was modified in preparation for a catapult and crane at <a href="Kure%20Naval%20Arsenal">Kure Naval Arsenal</a>. These were installed between 14 May and 6 June 1933. On 15 November, she became a training ship. "Ise"s crew participated in the state funeral of <a href="Gensui%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">Marshal-Admiral</a> The <a href="Marquis">Marquis</a> <a href="T%C5%8Dg%C5%8D%20Heihachir%C5%8D">Tōgō Heihachirō</a>, victor of the 1905 <a href="Battle%20of%20Tsushima">Battle of Tsushima</a>, on 15 June 1934.
Beginning on 1 August 1935, "Ise" was <a href="drydock">drydock</a>ed at Kure Naval Arsenal and underwent an extensive reconstruction and modernisation that lasted until 23 March 1937. On 9 April 1938, the ship began the first of her patrols off the southern Chinese coast during the <a href="Second%20Sino-Japanese%20War">Second Sino-Japanese War</a> that lasted until early 1941. She was transferred to the 2nd Division of the 1st Fleet on 15 November 1940 and became its flagship on 15 November 1941. Captain <a href="Takeda%20Isamu">Takeda Isamu</a> assumed command of "Ise" on 25 September 1941.

To provide distant support for the <a href="1st%20Air%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">1st Air Fleet</a> attacking <a href="Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a> on 8 December, the division, reinforced by the battleships and and the <a href="light%20carrier">light carrier</a> , <a href="sortie">sortie</a>d from <a href="Hashirajima">Hashirajima</a> to the <a href="Bonin%20Islands">Bonin Islands</a> and returned six days later. "Ise" had a minor refit at the Kure Naval Arsenal in 19–25 February 1942. Together with the rest of the division, she pursued, but did not catch, the American carrier force that had launched the <a href="Doolittle%20Raid">Doolittle Raid</a> on 18 April. On 11 May "Ise" had an accident which flooded her No. 2 <a href="engine%20room">engine room</a>. While under repair, the ship was fitted with one of the first experimental Type 21 <a href="early-warning%20radar">early-warning radar</a> sets in the IJN, but it was removed shortly afterwards.

"Ise" and the rest of the 2nd Battleship Division set sail on 28 May with the Aleutian Support Group at the same time that most of the Imperial Fleet began an attack on <a href="Midway%20Island">Midway Island</a> (<a href="Operation%20MI">Operation MI</a>). Commanded by <a href="Vice-Admiral">Vice-Admiral</a> <a href="Shir%C5%8D%20Takasu">Shirō Takasu</a>, the division was composed of Japan's four oldest battleships, including "Ise", accompanied by two <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a>s, 12 destroyers, and two <a href="oiler%20%28ship%29">oiler</a>s. Official records do not show the division as part of the larger Midway operation, known as <a href="Operation%20AL">Operation AL</a>; they were to accompany the fleet under Admiral <a href="Isoroku%20Yamamoto">Isoroku Yamamoto</a>, but were only to provide support to the Aleutian task force if needed.

The loss of four Japanese aircraft carriers during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a> in June severely limited the ability of the IJN to conduct operations and alternatives were sought. Plans for full conversions of battleships into aircraft carriers were rejected on the grounds of expense and, most critically, time, so the IJN settled on removing the rear pair of turrets from the "Ise"-class ships and replacing them with a flight deck equipped with two rotating catapults. "Ise" began her conversion on 23 February 1943 and Takeda was relieved by Captain Hase Shinzaburo on 25 April. The ship's No. 5 and No. 6 turrets were replaced by a hangar surmounted by a flight deck. This was not long enough to permit the launch of aircraft or their recovery. Two catapults were installed and the existing crane was moved to the flight deck. The deck was fitted with an extensive system of rails to link each catapult, the storage positions on the deck and the "T"-shaped aircraft <a href="elevator">lift</a> that moved aircraft between the flight deck and the hangar. It had a capacity of nine aircraft, the remainder being stowed on deck and one on each catapult for a total of 22–24. The ship's air group was intended to consist of a dozen each <a href="Yokosuka%20D4Y">Yokosuka D4Y</a> "Suisei" <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s (<a href="World%20War%20II%20Allied%20names%20for%20Japanese%20aircraft">Allied reporting name</a> "Judy"), modified for catapult launching, and <a href="Aichi%20E16A">Aichi E16A</a> reconnaissance aircraft (Allied reporting name "Paul"). The former had to land either on a conventional carrier or on land bases, whereas the E16A could be hoisted back aboard using a crane, after landing on the water near the ship.

During the conversion, all of the 14 cm guns were removed and the ship's anti-aircraft suite was heavily reinforced. The eight 12.7 cm Type 89 guns were supplemented with four additional twin mounts and the existing 2.5 cm Type 96 AA twin-gun mounts were replaced by 19 triple-gun mounts for a total of 57 weapons.

These changes increased the ship's overall length to and the removal of the heavy gun turrets and their barbettes reduced her displacement to at deep load, despite the addition of more <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> storage. The extra fuel increased "Ise"s range to . The weight reductions decreased her draught to . The crew now numbered 1,463 officers and enlisted men.
The rebuild was officially completed on 8 October 1943 and "Ise" made a sortie to <a href="Chuuk%20Lagoon">Truk</a> later that month, conveying a detachment of the <a href="52nd%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">52nd Division</a> and supplies. Hase was promoted to <a href="rear%20admiral">rear admiral</a> on 1 November and the ship began formally <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23W">working up</a> 10 days later. Captain Nakase Noboru relieved Hase on 25 December.

On 25 February 1944, Battleship Division 2 was assigned to the direct control of the <a href="Combined%20Fleet">Combined Fleet</a>. "Ise" and her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a> were transferred to the <a href="Third%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">Third Fleet</a> and assigned to the newly reformed <a href="Fourth%20Carrier%20Division">Fourth Carrier Division</a> on 1 May, commanded by Rear Admiral <a href="Chiaki%20Matsuda">Chiaki Matsuda</a>. That same day the <a href="634th%20Naval%20Air%20Group">634th Naval Air Group</a> was formed and assigned to the Fourth Carrier Division. On 24 May, a pair of <a href="Type%2022%20radar">Type 22</a> surface-search radars were installed aboard the ship. From 31 May to 7 June, "Ise"s light anti-aircraft armament was reinforced with 47 additional Type 96 AA guns in 12 triple and 11 single mounts, which brought her total to 104 guns. Two <a href="Identification%20friend%20or%20foe">Type 2 IFF</a> units were also installed.

On 23 June, the sisters conducted their first catapult training, each with four D4Ys and six E16As aboard; subsequent sessions were conducted on 21 July and 31 August. A pair of <a href="Type%2013%20radar">Type 13</a> early-warning radars and an E27 <a href="radar%20detector">radar detector</a> were installed from 22 to 26 July. From 28 September to 10 October, six racks of 30-tube 12.7 cm anti-aircraft <a href="rocket%20launcher">rocket launcher</a>s were added. Training of the D4Y and E16A aircrew was slowed by technical problems and was generally conducted from land bases. By 1 October the 634th had on strength 17 D4Ys, of which 6 were serviceable, and 18 E16As, of which 16 were operable.

After the Americans began attacking Japanese installations in the Bonin Islands on 10 October 1944, the aircraft of the Fourth Carrier Division were ordered to prepare for combat by the commander of the Combined Fleet, Admiral <a href="Soemu%20Toyoda">Soemu Toyoda</a>. Two days later, the 634th Naval Air Group was reassigned to the <a href="Second%20Air%20Fleet">Second Air Fleet</a> and began flying to bases in southern <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a>, among these were nine D4Ys and a dozen E16As assigned to "Ise" and "Hyūga". On 14 October they attacked the aircraft carriers of <a href="Task%20Force%2038">Task Force 38</a> <a href="Formosa%20Air%20Battle">near Formosa with little effect and heavy losses</a>. The following day Nakase was promoted to rear admiral.

The ships of the Fourth Carrier Division were assigned to the Main Body of the <a href="1st%20Mobile%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">1st Mobile Fleet</a>, commanded by Vice-Admiral <a href="Jisabur%C5%8D%20Ozawa">Jisaburō Ozawa</a>. The Main Body's role was to act as a decoy to attract attention away from the two other forces approaching from the south and west. All forces were to converge on <a href="Leyte%20Gulf">Leyte Gulf</a> on 25 October and the Main Body left Japan on 20 October. By the morning of 24 October, the Main Body was within range of the northernmost American carriers of Task Force 38 and Ozawa ordered an air strike launched by the <a href="Third%20Carrier%20Division">Third Carrier Division</a> ("Ise" and "Hyūga" had no aircraft aboard) to attract the attention of the Americans. This accomplished little else as the Japanese aircraft failed to penetrate past the defending fighters; the survivors landed at airfields on the Philippine island of <a href="Luzon">Luzon</a>. The Americans were preoccupied dealing with the other Japanese naval forces and defending themselves from air attacks launched from Luzon and Leyte and could not spare any aircraft to search for the Japanese carriers until the afternoon. They finally found them, but Admiral <a href="William%20Halsey%2C%20Jr.">William Halsey, Jr.</a>, commander of Task Force 38, decided that it was too late in the day to mount an effective strike. He did, however, turn all of his ships north to position himself for a dawn attack on the Japanese carriers the next day.
On the morning of 25 October, "Ise" was positioned astern of the carriers and to protect them with her anti-aircraft guns. Her radar picked up American aircraft at a range of at 07:39, but the first attack did not begin until 08:20. The battleship engaged them with <a href="San%20Shiki%20%28anti-aircraft%20shell%29">San Shiki anti-aircraft shells</a> from her main guns with unknown effect. She was not heavily attacked at that time and was near missed by two bombs. The second wave of aircraft attacked at 10:05 and the ship's gunners claimed to have shot down five out of ten attacking dive bombers. "Ise" was near missed eight times, although one small bomb struck No. 2 turret. The third wave was detected by her radar at 12:28, but it did not attack the battleship, sinking the damaged "Zuikaku" and "Zuihō" instead. "Ise" rescued 98 survivors from "Zuihō" before the next attack began around 17:26. She was the primary focus of this wave and was attacked by about 85 dive bombers and at least 11 <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a>s. Saved by heavy anti-aircraft fire and expert manoeuvring, the battleship dodged all of the torpedoes, and was only struck once, near the port catapult. Roughly 34 near misses damaged her hull plating near the waterline and started a small leak that contaminated a small oil tank and caused minor damage to the port boiler rooms. Splinters from the near misses and the single hit killed 5 crewmen and wounded 71.

The American submarine spotted the Fourth Carrier Division at 17:42 and manoeuvred to attack, missing with six torpedoes at 18:43. At 19:00 Ozawa ordered Matsuda to take his ships south to defend the light cruiser and her escorting destroyers that were attempting to rescue survivors of the crippled light carrier despite gunfire from a group of four American <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s. Unable to locate either group of ships, Ozawa ordered Matsuda to reverse course at 23:30 and head for <a href="Amami%20%C5%8Cshima">Amami Ōshima</a> to refuel. Despite being spotted by American submarines en route, the division arrived safely on 27 October. After leaving the island the following day, they were unsuccessfully attacked by the submarine before their arrival at <a href="Kure%2C%20Hiroshima">Kure</a> on the 29th.

Between 29 October and 8 November, the catapults were removed to improve the firing arcs of No. 3 and No. 4 turrets. "Ise" and "Hyūga" departed on 11 November, loaded with troops and munitions for <a href="Manila">Manila</a>, capital of the Philippines, but news was received of heavy American air attacks on Manila and they were diverted to the <a href="Spratly%20Islands">Spratly Islands</a>. They arrived on 14 November and their cargo was unloaded so it could be transshipped to the Philippines. The 4th Carrier Division was transferred to the <a href="2nd%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">2nd Fleet</a> the following day. Reinforced by the battleship and three cruisers, the sisters proceeded on to <a href="Lingga%20Island">Lingga Island</a>, near <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>, on 20 November. They arrived two days later and remained there until 12 December when they departed for <a href="Cam%20Ranh%20Bay">Cam Ranh Bay</a>, <a href="French%20Indochina">French Indochina</a>, where they were on standby for an attack on an American supply convoy bound for the island of <a href="Mindanao">Mindanao</a> in the Philippines. The attack was cancelled on the 30th and the ships sailed for Singapore where they arrived on 1 January 1945 before continuing on to Lingga. That same day the Fourth Carrier Division was transferred to the <a href="Southwest%20Area%20Fleet">Southwest Area Fleet</a>.

On 6 February, the division sailed for Singapore to participate in <a href="Operation%20Kita">Operation Kita</a>. While approaching Singapore, "Ise" was slightly damaged by a <a href="naval%20mine">mine</a>. Given temporary repairs at the former British naval base there, "Ise", "Hyūga", and the light cruiser were loaded with critically needed strategic war supplies (oil, <a href="rubber">rubber</a>, <a href="tin">tin</a>, <a href="zinc">zinc</a>, and <a href="Mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a>) and 1,150 surplus <a href="Roughneck">oil workers</a> to be ferried back to Japan.

The division sailed from Singapore on 10 February and was spotted by the British submarine the following day. It was forced to submerge by a <a href="maritime%20patrol%20aircraft">maritime patrol aircraft</a> and was unable to attack. On 13 February the submarine unsuccessfully attacked the ships as did the submarine . One of "Ise"s AA guns caused one of "Blower"s torpedoes to detonate prematurely. Later that afternoon, "Oyodo" launched one of her floatplanes which spotted the submarine on the surface about ahead of the convoy. "Hyūga" opened fire with her main guns and forced "Bashaw" to submerge when one of her shells landed within of the submarine. The convoy reached the <a href="Matsu%20Islands">Matsu Islands</a>, off the Chinese coast, on the 15th and was unsuccessfully attacked by the submarine before they reached <a href="Zhoushan%20Island">Zhoushan Island</a>, near <a href="Shanghai">Shanghai</a> that night. The convoy reached Kure on 20 February, having evaded or escaped pursuit by twenty-three <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> submarines along the way. Nakase was relieved by Captain Mutaguchi Kakuro five days later.
The 4th Carrier Division was disbanded on 1 March and "Ise" was reduced to first-class reserve. From this time until the <a href="surrender%20of%20Japan">surrender of Japan</a>, "Ise" remained docked at Kure, without fuel or aircraft, and repainted in an olive green <a href="camouflage">camouflage</a> with vari-coloured splotches. The camouflage was not effective against American carrier-based aircraft from <a href="Task%20Force%2058">Task Force 58</a> (TF 58) on 19 March, when more than 240 aircraft <a href="Attack%20on%20Kure%20%28March%201945%29">attacked Kure</a> and "Ise" was hit by two bombs. Re-designated as a fourth-class reserve ship on 20 April, "Ise" was towed to the island of Ondo Seto (between Kure and <a href="Kurahashijima">Kurahashijima</a>) to serve as a floating anti-aircraft battery. She was <a href="Bombing%20of%20Kure%20%28July%201945%29">attacked again on 24 July</a> by 60 carrier-based aircraft, whose bombs hit the starboard bow, flight deck, main deck, No. 3 turret and <a href="bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a>, killing Mutaguchi, other bridge personnel, and around 50 crewmen; many other crewmen were wounded. The ship settled by the bow and it took three days to pump her dry and the IJN planned to drydock her for repairs. On 28 July she was struck by five bombs dropped by <a href="F4U%20Corsair">F4U Corsair</a> fighters from , and eleven more bombs dropped by other aircraft from TF 58. Later that day an attack by 18 <a href="USAAF">USAAF</a> <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">Consolidated B-24 Liberator</a> <a href="heavy%20bomber">heavy bomber</a>s was unsuccessful. "Ise" took on a 15° <a href="list%20%28watercraft%29">list</a> to starboard and sank in shallow water. <a href="Marine%20salvage">Salvage</a> efforts were abandoned that same day, although some AA guns were stripped from her wreck. The ship was struck from the <a href="Navy%20list">Navy list</a> on 20 November. The underwater portion of "Ise"s wreck was ignored until the following year and she was scrapped in place by the Kure Dockyard of the <a href="IHI%20Corporation">Harima Zōsen Corporation</a> from 9 October 1946 to 4 July 1947.

Japanese battleship Yamashiro

"Yamashiro" was modernized between 1930 and 1935, with improvements to her armor and machinery and a rebuilt superstructure in the <a href="pagoda%20mast">pagoda mast</a> style. Nevertheless, with only <a href="Vickers%2014%20inch/45%20naval%20gun">14-inch guns</a>, she was outclassed by other Japanese battleships at the beginning of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, and played auxiliary roles for most of the war.

By 1944, though, she was forced into front-line duty, serving as the flagship of <a href="Vice-Admiral">Vice-Admiral</a> <a href="Sh%C5%8Dji%20Nishimura">Shōji Nishimura</a>'s Southern Force at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Surigao%20Strait">Battle of Surigao Strait</a>, the southernmost action of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Leyte%20Gulf">Battle of Leyte Gulf</a>. During fierce night fighting in the early hours of 25 October against a superior American force, "Yamashiro" was sunk by <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>es and naval gunfire. Nishimura went down with his ship, and only 10 crewmembers survived.

The ship had a length of <a href="Length%20between%20perpendiculars">between perpendiculars</a> and <a href="length%20overall">overall</a>. She had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draft</a> of . "Yamashiro" <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> at <a href="Standard%20displacement%23Standard%20displacement">standard load</a> and at <a href="Full-load%20displacement">full load</a>. Her crew consisted of 1,198 officers and enlisted men in 1915 and about 1,400 in 1935.

During the ship's modernization during 1930–35, her forward superstructure was enlarged with multiple platforms added to her tripod foremast. Her rear superstructure was rebuilt to accommodate mounts for <a href="anti-aircraft">anti-aircraft</a> (AA) guns and additional <a href="Fire-control%20system%23Naval%20fire%20control">fire-control directors</a>. "Yamashiro" was also given <a href="torpedo%20bulge">torpedo bulge</a>s to improve her underwater protection and to compensate for the weight of the additional armor. In addition, her stern was lengthened by . These changes increased her overall length to , her beam to and her draft to . Her displacement increased nearly to at deep load.

The ship had two sets of <a href="John%20Brown%20and%20Company">Brown-Curtis</a> direct-drive <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s, each of which drove two propeller shafts. The turbines were designed to produce a total of , using steam provided by 24 Miyahara-type <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s, each of which consumed a mixture of coal and oil. "Yamashiro" had a stowage capacity of of coal and of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a>, giving her a range of at a speed of . The ship exceeded her designed speed of during her <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s, reaching at .

During her modernization, the Miyahara boilers were replaced by six new Kanpon oil-fired boilers fitted in the former aft boiler room, and the forward <a href="funnel%20%28ship%29">funnel</a> was removed. The Brown-Curtis turbines were replaced by four geared Kanpon turbines with a designed output of . On her trials, "Yamashiro"s <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a> "Fusō" reached a top speed of from . The fuel storage of the ship was increased to a total of of fuel oil that gave her a range of at a speed of .

The twelve 45-<a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">calibre</a> <a href="Vickers%2014%20inch/45%20naval%20gun">14-inch</a> guns of "Yamashiro" were mounted in six twin-gun turrets, numbered one through six from front to rear, each with an elevation range of −5 to +30 degrees. The turrets were arranged in an unorthodox 2-1-1-2 style with <a href="superfire">superfiring</a> pairs of turrets fore and aft; the middle turrets were not superfiring, and had a funnel between them. The main guns and their turrets were modernized during the ship's 1930 reconstruction; the maximum elevation of the main guns was increased to +43 degrees, increasing their maximum range from . Initially, the guns could fire at a rate of 1.5 <a href="Cartridge%20%28firearms%29">rounds</a> per minute, and this was also improved during her first modernization.

Originally, "Yamashiro" was fitted with a secondary armament of sixteen 50-caliber <a href="15%20cm/50%2041st%20Year%20Type">6-inch guns</a> mounted in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s on the upper sides of the hull. Each gun could fire a <a href="Shell%20%28projectile%29%23High-explosive">high-explosive projectile</a> to a maximum range of at up to six shots per minute. She was later fitted with six high-angle 40-caliber <a href="8%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bcm/40%203rd%20Year%20Type%20naval%20gun">three-inch</a> AA guns, in single mounts on both sides of the forward superstructure and both sides of the second funnel, as well as on both sides of the aft superstructure. These guns had a maximum elevation of +75 degrees, and could fire a shell at a rate of 13 to 20 rounds per minute to a maximum height of . The ship was also fitted with six submerged <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, three on each <a href="broadside">broadside</a>.
During "Yamashiro"s modernization in the early 1930s, all six three-inch guns were removed and replaced with eight 40-caliber <a href="12.7%20cm/40%20Type%2089%20naval%20gun">127-millimeter</a> <a href="dual-purpose%20gun">dual-purpose gun</a>s, fitted on both sides of the fore and aft superstructures in four twin-gun mounts. When firing at surface targets, the guns had a range of ; they had a maximum ceiling of at their maximum elevation of +90 degrees. Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute, but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute.

The improvements made during the reconstruction increased "Yamashiro"s draft by ; the two foremost six-inch guns were removed, as the same guns on her sister ship had gotten soaked in high seas after that ship's reconstruction. The ship's light-AA armament was augmented by eight <a href="Type%2096%2025%20mm%20AT/AA%20Gun">25 mm Type 96</a> light AA guns in twin-gun mounts. Four of these mounts were fitted on the forward superstructure, one on each side of the funnel and two on the rear superstructure. This was the standard Japanese light-AA gun during World War II, but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon. According to historian Mark Stille, the twin and triple mounts "lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets; the gun exhibited excessive vibration; the magazine was too small, and, finally, the gun produced excessive muzzle blast". The configuration of the AA guns varied significantly over time; in 1943, 17 single and two twin-mounts were added for a total of 37. In July 1944, the ship was fitted with another 17 single, 15 twin and eight triple-mounts, for a total of 92 anti-aircraft guns in her final configuration. The gun had an effective range of , and an effective ceiling of at an elevation of 85 degrees. The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the fifteen-round magazines.

Also in July 1944, the ship was provided with three twin-gun and 10 single mounts for the license-built <a href="13.2%20mm%20Hotchkiss%20machine%20gun">13.2 mm Hotchkiss machine gun</a>. The maximum range of these guns was , but the effective range against aircraft was only . The cyclic rate was adjustable between 425 and 475 rounds per minute, but the need to change 30-round <a href="magazine%20%28firearms%29">magazines</a> reduced the effective rate to 250 rounds per minute.

The ship's <a href="waterline">waterline</a> <a href="belt%20armor">armor belt</a> was thick; below it was a <a href="strake">strake</a> of armor. The <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> armor ranged in thickness from . The turrets were protected with an armor thickness of on the face, on the sides, and on the roof. The <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s of the turrets were protected by armor 305 mm thick, while the casemates of the 152 mm guns were protected by 152 mm armor plates. The sides of the <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> were thick. Additionally, the vessel contained 737 watertight compartments (574 underneath the armor deck, 163 above) to preserve buoyancy in the event of battle damage.

During her first reconstruction "Yamashiro"s armor was substantially upgraded. The deck armor was increased to a maximum thickness of . A longitudinal <a href="bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkhead</a> of of high-tensile steel was added to improve the underwater protection.

"Yamashiro" was briefly fitted with an aircraft <a href="flight%20deck">flying-off platform</a> on Turret No. 2 in 1922. She successfully launched <a href="Gloster%20Sparrowhawk">Gloster Sparrowhawk</a> and <a href="Sopwith%20Camel">Sopwith Camel</a> <a href="fighter%20%28aircraft%29">fighters</a> from it, the first Japanese ship to do so. During her modernization in the 1930s, a <a href="aircraft%20catapult">catapult</a> and a collapsible <a href="crane%20%28machine%29">crane</a> were fitted on the stern, and the ship was equipped to operate three <a href="floatplane">floatplane</a>s, although no <a href="hangar">hangar</a> was provided. The initial <a href="Nakajima%20E4N">Nakajima E4N2</a> biplanes were replaced by <a href="Nakajima%20E8N">Nakajima E8N2</a> biplanes in 1938 and then by <a href="Mitsubishi%20F1M">Mitsubishi F1M</a> biplanes, from 1942 on.

The ship was originally fitted with two and two <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a>s in her forward superstructure, a rangefinder on the roof of Turret No. 2, and 4.5-meter rangefinders in Turrets 3, 4, and 5.

While in <a href="drydock">drydock</a> in July 1943, a <a href="List%20of%20Japanese%20World%20War%20II%20radar%23Shipborne%20Radar">Type 21</a> air search <a href="radar">radar</a> was installed on the roof of the 10-meter rangefinder at the top of the pagoda mast. In August 1944, two Type 22 surface search radar units were installed on the pagoda mast and two Type 13 <a href="early%20warning%20radar">early warning radar</a> units were fitted on her mainmast.

"Yamashiro", named for <a href="Yamashiro%20Province">Yamashiro Province</a>, the former province of <a href="Kyoto">Kyoto</a>, was <a href="Keel">laid down</a> at the <a href="Yokosuka%20Naval%20Arsenal">Yokosuka Naval Arsenal</a> on 20 November 1913 and <a href="Ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 3 November 1915. She was completed on 31 March 1917 with <a href="Captain%20%28naval%29">Captain</a> <a href="Suketomo%20Nakajima">Suketomo Nakajima</a> in command, and was assigned to the 1st Division of the <a href="1st%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">1st Fleet</a> in 1917–1918. She did not take part in any combat during World War I, as there were no longer any forces of the <a href="Central%20Powers">Central Powers</a> in East Asia by the time she was completed, but she did patrol off the coast of China briefly during the war. On 29 March 1922, a Gloster Sparrowhawk fighter successfully took off from the ship. She aided survivors of the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake in September 1923. Little detailed information is available about "Yamashiro"s activities during the 1920s, although she did make a port visit to <a href="Ryojun%20Guard%20District">Ryojun Guard District</a>, in <a href="Manchuria">Manchuria</a>, on 5 April 1925 and also conducted training off the coast of China.

The ship's reconstruction began on 18 December 1930 at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal where her machinery was replaced, her armor was reinforced, and torpedo bulges were fitted. "Yamashiro"s armament was also upgraded and her torpedo tubes were removed. Captain <a href="Chuichi%20Nagumo">Chuichi Nagumo</a> assumed command of the ship on 15 November 1934, her modernization was completed on 30 March 1935, and she became flagship of the Combined Fleet. Captain <a href="Masakichi%20Okuma">Masakichi Okuma</a> relieved Nagumo on 15 November and he, in turn, was replaced by Captain <a href="Masami%20Kobayashi">Masami Kobayashi</a> on 1 December 1936. "Yamashiro" began a lengthy refit on 27 June 1937 and Captain <a href="Kasuke%20Abe">Kasuke Abe</a> assumed command on 20 October. Her refit was completed on 31 March 1938 and Captain <a href="Kakuji%20Kakuta">Kakuji Kakuta</a> relieved Abe on 15 November. In early 1941, the ship experimentally launched radio-controlled <a href="Kawanishi%20E7K">Kawanishi E7K2</a> floatplanes. Captain <a href="Chozaemon%20Obata">Chozaemon Obata</a> assumed command on 24 May 1941 and "Yamashiro" was assigned to the 1st Fleet's 2nd Division, consisting of the two "Fusō"-class and the two s.

"Yamashiro" and her sister ship "Fusō" spent most of the war around Japan, mostly at the anchorage at Hashirajima in Hiroshima Bay. When the war started for Japan on 8 December, the division, reinforced by the battleships and and the light carrier , <a href="sortie">sortie</a>d from <a href="Hashirajima">Hashirajima</a> to the Bonin Islands as distant support for the <a href="1st%20Air%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">1st Air Fleet</a> attacking <a href="Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a>, and returned six days later. On 18 April 1942, "Yamashiro" chased the <a href="Doolittle%20Raid">Doolittle Raid</a>er force that had just launched an air raid on Tokyo, but returned four days later without having made contact. On 28 May, she set sail, commanded by Captain <a href="Gunji%20Kogure">Gunji Kogure</a>, with the rest of the 2nd Battleship Division and the Aleutian Support Group at the same time that most of the Imperial Fleet began an attack on <a href="Midway%20Island">Midway Island</a> (<a href="Operation%20MI">Operation MI</a>). Commanded by Vice-Admiral <a href="Shir%C5%8D%20Takasu">Shirō Takasu</a>, the division was composed of Japan's four oldest battleships, including "Yamashiro", accompanied by two <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a>s, 12 <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s, and two <a href="oiler%20%28ship%29">oiler</a>s. Official records do not show the squadron as part of the larger Midway operation, known as <a href="Operation%20AL">Operation AL</a>; they were to accompany the fleet under Admiral <a href="Isoroku%20Yamamoto">Isoroku Yamamoto</a>, but were only to provide support to the Aleutian task force if needed. They were not needed, and "Yamashiro" returned to home waters where she was employed mostly for training duties, in the Inland Sea till 1 February 1943 and at Yokosuka until September, when she became a training ship for midshipmen.

In an effort to replace the aircraft carriers lost at the Battle of Midway, the Navy made plans to convert the two "Fusō"-class ships to hybrid battleship/carriers, but the two "Ise"-class battleships were chosen instead. In July 1943, "Yamashiro" was at the Yokosuka drydock for fitting of a radar and additional 25 mm AA guns. The ship was briefly assigned as a training ship on 15 September before loading troops on 13 October bound for <a href="Chuuk%20Lagoon">Truk</a> Naval Base, arriving with the battleship on the 20th. The two battleships sailed for Japan, accompanied by the carriers and , on 31 October. On 8 November, the submarine fired torpedoes at "Jun'yo" that missed, but hit "Yamashiro" with a torpedo that failed to detonate. "Yamashiro" resumed her training duties in Japan, and Captain <a href="Yoshioki%20Tawara">Yoshioki Tawara</a> assumed command. He was promoted to Rear Admiral on 1 May, but died of natural causes four days later, and Captain <a href="Katsukiyo%20Shinoda">Katsukiyo Shinoda</a> was appointed to replace him.

During the <a href="invasion%20of%20Saipan">US invasion of Saipan</a> in June 1944, Japanese troop ships attempting to reinforce the defenses were sunk by submarines. <a href="Shigenori%20Kami">Shigenori Kami</a>, chief of operations of the Navy Staff, volunteered to command "Yamashiro" to carry troops and equipment to Saipan. If the ship actually reached the island, he intended to deliberately beach the ship before it could be sunk and to use its artillery to defend the island. After <a href="Ry%C5%ABnosuke%20Kusaka">Ryūnosuke Kusaka</a>, <a href="Chief%20of%20staff%20%28military%29">Chief of Staff</a> of the <a href="Combined%20Fleet">Combined Fleet</a>, also volunteered to go, <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Japan">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Hideki%20T%C5%8Dj%C5%8D">Hideki Tōjō</a> approved the plan, known as Operation "Y-GO", but the operation was cancelled after the decisive defeat in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Philippine%20Sea">Battle of the Philippine Sea</a> on 19 and 20 June.

The ship was refitted in July at Yokosuka, where additional radar systems and light AA guns were fitted. "Yamashiro" and her sister ship were transferred to Battleship Division 2 of the <a href="2nd%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">2nd Fleet</a> on 10 September. The ship briefly became the division's <a href="flagship">flagship</a> under Vice Admiral Shōji Nishimura until 23 September when he transferred his flag to "Fusō". They departed Kure on 23 September for <a href="Lingga%20Island">Lingga Island</a>, carrying the Army's <a href="25th%20Independent%20Mixed%20Regiment">25th Independent Mixed Regiment</a>, and escaped an attack by the submarine the next day. They arrived on 4 October, where Nishimura transferred his flag back to "Yamashiro". The ships then transferred to Brunei to offload their toops and refuel in preparation for Operation "Shō-Gō", the attempt to destroy the American fleet conducting the <a href="invasion%20of%20Luzon">invasion of Luzon</a>.

As flagship of Nishimura's Southern Force, "Yamashiro" left <a href="Brunei">Brunei</a> at 15:30 on 22 October 1944, heading east into the <a href="Sulu%20Sea">Sulu Sea</a> and then to the northeast into the <a href="Mindanao%20Sea">Mindanao Sea</a>. Intending to join Vice-Admiral <a href="Takeo%20Kurita">Takeo Kurita</a>'s force in <a href="Leyte%20Gulf">Leyte Gulf</a>, they passed west of <a href="Mindanao%20Island">Mindanao Island</a> into Surigao Strait, where they met a large force of battleships and cruisers lying in wait. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Surigao%20Strait">Battle of Surigao Strait</a> would become the southernmost action in the Battle of Leyte Gulf.

At 09:08 on 24 October, "Yamashiro", "Fusō" and the <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a> <a href="Japanese%20cruiser%20Mogami%20%281934%29">"Mogami"</a> were spotted by a group of 27 planes, including <a href="Grumman%20TBF%20Avenger">Grumman TBF Avenger</a> <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a>s and <a href="Curtiss%20SB2C%20Helldiver">Curtiss SB2C Helldiver</a> <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s escorted by <a href="Grumman%20F6F%20Hellcat">Grumman F6F Hellcat</a> fighters, coming from the carrier . Around 20 sailors on "Yamashiro" were killed by strafing and rocket attacks, and the ship <a href="list%20%28watercraft%29">listed</a> by almost 15 degrees after a bomb's near miss damaged the hull and flooded the starboard <a href="bilge">bilge</a>, until counter-flooding in the port bilge righted the ship.

Nishimura issued a telegram to Admiral <a href="Soemu%20Toyoda">Soemu Toyoda</a> at 20:13: "It is my plan to charge into Leyte Gulf to [reach] a point off Dulag at 04:00 hours on the 25th." At 22:52, his force opened fire, damaging and and forcing them to retreat before they could launch their torpedoes. Three American destroyers launched torpedoes at 03:00 that morning, hitting "Fusō" at 03:08 and forcing her to fall out of formation. "Yamashiro" opened fire with her secondary battery seven minutes later. Around 03:11, the destroyers <a href="USS%20Monssen%20%28DD-798%29">"Monssen"</a> and <a href="USS%20Killen%20%28DD-593%29">"Killen"</a> fired their torpedoes, one or two of which hit "Yamashiro" <a href="amidships">amidships</a>. The resulting damage temporarily slowed the ship down, gave her a list to port and forced the flooding of the <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a>s for the two aft turrets. "Yamashiro" may have been hit a third time near the bow at 03:40.

At 03:52, the battleship was attacked by a large formation to the north commanded by Rear Admiral <a href="Jesse%20Oldendorf">Jesse Oldendorf</a>. First came 6- and shells from three heavy cruisers, , , and , and four light cruisers, , , and . Six battleships formed a battle line; the Pearl Harbor veteran was the first to open fire a minute later, scoring at least one hit with shells in the first salvo, followed by and . Hampered by older radar equipment, joined the fight late, never fired, and managed to fire exactly one salvo—the last of the engagement. The Australian heavy cruiser <a href="HMS%20Shropshire%20%2883%29">HMAS "Shropshire"</a> also had radar problems and did not begin firing until 03:56.

The main bombardment lasted 18 minutes, and "Yamashiro" was the only target for seven of them. The first rounds hit the <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a> and pagoda mast, and soon the entire battleship appeared to be ablaze. "Yamashiro" two forward turrets targeted her assailants, and the secondary armament targeted the American destroyers plaguing "Mogami" and the destroyer <a href="Japanese%20destroyer%20Asagumo%20%281938%29">"Asagumo"</a>. The ship continued firing in all directions, but was not able to target the battleships with the other four operable 14-inch guns of her amidships turrets until almost 04:00, after turning west. There was a big explosion at 04:04, possibly from one of the middle turrets. "Yamashiro" increased her firing rate between 04:03 and 04:09, despite the widespread fires and damage, and was hit during this time near the starboard engine room by a torpedo. By 04:09, her speed was back up to 12 knots, and Nishimura wired to Kurita: "We proceed till totally annihilated. I have definitely accomplished my mission as pre-arranged. Please rest assured." At the same time, Oldendorf issued a brief cease-fire order to the entire formation after hearing that the destroyer <a href="USS%20Albert%20W.%20Grant%20%28DD-649%29">"Albert W. Grant"</a> was taking <a href="friendly%20fire">friendly fire</a>, and the Japanese ships also ceased fire.

"Yamashiro" increased speed to 15 knots in an attempt to escape the trap, but she had already been hit by two to four torpedoes, and after two more torpedo hits near the starboard engine room, likely fired by the <a href="USS%20Bennion">USS Bennion</a>, she was listing 45 degrees to port. Shinoda gave the command to abandon ship, but neither he nor Nishimura made any attempt to leave the conning tower as the ship capsized within five minutes and quickly sank, stern first, vanishing from radar between 04:19 and 04:21. Only 10 crewmembers of the estimated 1,636 officers and crew on board survived.

<a href="John%20Bennett%20%28diver%29">John Bennett</a> claimed to have discovered "Yamashiro"s wreck in April 2001, but confirmation of the wreck's identity could not be made. On 26 November 2017, <a href="Paul%20Allen">Paul Allen</a> and his crew aboard the research ship R/V "Petrel", discovered the wreck of "Yamashiro" and confirmed her identity. The ship was found upside down and mostly intact, with the forward bow folded over the hull and the area around the engine rooms partially collapsed.

Japanese battleship Nagato

, named for <a href="Nagato%20Province">Nagato Province</a>, was a <a href="super-dreadnought">super-dreadnought</a> <a href="battleship">battleship</a> built for the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> (IJN). Completed in 1920 as the <a href="lead%20ship">lead ship</a> of <a href="Nagato-class%20battleship">her class</a>, she carried supplies for the survivors of the <a href="1923%20Great%20Kant%C5%8D%20earthquake">Great Kantō earthquake</a> in 1923. The ship was modernized in 1934–1936 with improvements to her armor and machinery and a rebuilt superstructure in the <a href="pagoda%20mast">pagoda mast</a> style. "Nagato" briefly participated in the <a href="Second%20Sino-Japanese%20War">Second Sino-Japanese War</a> in 1937 and was the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of <a href="Admiral">Admiral</a> <a href="Isoroku%20Yamamoto">Isoroku Yamamoto</a> during the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>. She covered the withdrawal of the attacking ships and did not participate in the attack itself.

Other than participating in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a> in June 1942, where she did not see combat, the ship spent most of the first two years of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a> training in home waters. She was transferred to <a href="Chuuk%20Lagoon">Truk</a> in mid-1943, but did not see any combat until the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Philippine%20Sea">Battle of the Philippine Sea</a> in mid-1944 when she was attacked by American aircraft. "Nagato" did not fire her main armament against enemy vessels until the <a href="Battle%20of%20Leyte%20Gulf">Battle of Leyte Gulf</a> in October. She was lightly damaged during the battle and returned to Japan the following month. The IJN was running out of fuel by this time and decided not to fully repair her. "Nagato" was converted into a floating <a href="anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> platform and assigned to coastal defense duties. <a href="Attack%20on%20Yokosuka">She was attacked in July 1945</a> as part of the American campaign to destroy the IJN's last remaining <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>s, but was only slightly damaged and went on to be the only Japanese battleship to have survived <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. In mid-1946, the ship was a target for <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a> tests during <a href="Operation%20Crossroads">Operation Crossroads</a>. She survived the first test with little damage, but was sunk by the second.

"Nagato" had a length of <a href="Length%20between%20perpendiculars">between perpendiculars</a> and <a href="length%20overall">overall</a>. She had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draft</a> of . The ship <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> at <a href="Standard%20displacement%23Standard%20displacement">standard load</a> and at <a href="Full-load%20displacement">full load</a>. Her crew consisted of 1,333 officers and enlisted men as built and 1,368 in 1935. The crew totaled around 1,734 men in 1944.

In 1930, "Nagato"s bow was remodeled to reduce the amount of spray produced when steaming into a <a href="head%20sea">head sea</a>. This increased her overall length by to . During her 1934–1936 reconstruction, the ship's stern was lengthened by to improve her speed and her forward superstructure was rebuilt into a <a href="pagoda%20mast">pagoda mast</a>. She was given <a href="torpedo%20bulge">torpedo bulge</a>s to improve her underwater protection and to compensate for the weight of the additional armor and equipment. These changes increased her overall length to , her beam to and her draft to . Her displacement increased over to at deep load. The ship's <a href="metacentric%20height">metacentric height</a> at deep load was . In November 1944, the tops of "Nagato"s mainmast and funnel were removed to improve the effective arcs of fire for her anti-aircraft guns.

"Nagato" was equipped with four Gihon geared <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s, each of which drove one propeller shaft. The turbines were designed to produce a total of , using steam provided by 21 Kampon <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s; 15 of these were oil-fired while the remaining half-dozen consumed a mixture of coal and oil. The ship could carry of coal and of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a>, giving her a range of at a speed of . The ship exceeded her designed speed of during her <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s, reaching at .

<a href="Funnel%20%28ship%29">Funnel</a> smoke would often choke and blind crewmen on the <a href="bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a> and in the <a href="fire-control%20system">fire-control system</a>s so a "fingernail"-shaped deflector was installed on the fore funnel in 1922 to direct the exhaust away from them. It was less than effective and the fore funnel was rebuilt in a serpentine shape in an unsuccessful effort during a refit in 1924. That funnel was eliminated during the ship's 1930s reconstruction when all of her boilers were replaced by ten oil-fired <a href="Kampon">Kampon</a> boilers, which had a working pressure of and temperature of . In addition her turbines were replaced by lighter, more modern, units. When "Nagato" conducted her post-reconstruction trials, she reached a speed of with . Additional fuel oil was stored in the bottoms of the newly added torpedo bulges, which increased her capacity to and thus her range to at 16 knots.

"Nagato"s eight 45-<a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">caliber</a> <a href="41%20cm/45%203rd%20Year%20Type%20naval%20gun">41-centimeter</a> (16 inch) guns were mounted in two pairs of twin-gun, <a href="superfire">superfiring</a> turrets fore and aft. Numbered one through four from front to rear, the hydraulically powered turrets gave the guns an elevation range of −2 to +35 degrees. The rate of fire for the guns was around two rounds per minute. The turrets aboard the "Nagato"-class ships were replaced in the mid-1930s with the turrets stored from the unfinished s. While in storage the turrets had been modified to increase their range of elevation to –3 to +43 degrees, which increased the gun's maximum range from .

The ship's secondary armament of twenty 50-caliber <a href="14%20cm/50%203rd%20Year%20Type%20naval%20gun">14-centimeter</a> guns was mounted in casemates on the upper sides of the hull and in the superstructure. The manually operated guns had a maximum range of and fired at a rate of six to 10 rounds per minute. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by four 40-caliber <a href="8%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bcm/40%203rd%20Year%20Type%20naval%20gun">3rd Year Type three-in</a>ch AA guns in single mounts. The high-angle guns had a maximum elevation of +75 degrees, and had a rate of fire of 13 to 20 rounds per minute. The ship was also fitted with eight <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, four on each <a href="broadside">broadside</a>, two above water and two submerged.
Around 1926, the four above-water torpedo tubes were removed and the ship received three additional 76 mm AA guns that were situated around the base of the foremast. They were replaced by eight 40-caliber <a href="12.7%20cm/40%20Type%2089%20naval%20gun">12.7-centimeter Type 89 dual-purpose</a> (DP) guns in 1932, fitted on both sides of the fore and aft superstructures in four twin-gun mounts. When firing at surface targets, the guns had a range of ; they had a maximum ceiling of at their maximum elevation of +90 degrees. Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute, but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute. Two twin-gun mounts for license-built <a href="Vickers">Vickers</a> <a href="QF%202%20pounder%20naval%20gun">two-pounder</a> light AA guns were also added to the ship that same year. These guns had a maximum elevation of +80 degrees which gave them a ceiling of . They had a maximum rate of fire of 200 rounds per minute.

When the ship was reconstructed in 1934–1936, the remaining torpedo tubes and the two forward 14 cm (5-1/2 inch) guns were removed from the hull. The remaining 14 cm guns had their elevation increased to +35 degrees which increased their range to . An unknown number of license-building <a href="Hotchkiss%20M1929%20machine%20gun">Hotchkiss M1929 machine gun</a> in twin mounts were added. The maximum range of these guns was , but the effective range against aircraft was . The cyclic rate was adjustable between 425 and 475 rounds per minute, but the need to change 30-round <a href="magazine%20%28firearms%29">magazines</a> reduced the effective rate to 250 rounds per minute.

The unsatisfactory two-pounders were replaced in 1939 by twenty license-built Type 96 Hotchkiss <a href="Type%2096%2025%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bmm%20AT/AA%20Gun">Type 96</a> light AA guns in a mixture of twin-gun and single mounts. This was the standard Japanese light <a href="AA%20gun">AA gun</a> during World War II, but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon. According to historian Mark Stille, the twin and triple mounts "lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets; the gun exhibited excessive vibration; the magazine was too small, and, finally, the gun produced excessive muzzle blast". These 25 mm guns had an effective range of , and an effective ceiling of at an elevation of 85 degrees. The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the fifteen-round magazines. Additional Type 96 guns were installed during the war; on 10 July 1944, the ship was reported to have 98 guns on board. An additional 30 guns were added during a refit in Yokosuka in November. Two more twin 12.7 cm (5 inch) gun mounts were added at the same time abreast the funnel and her 14 cm guns were removed as she was by then a floating anti-aircraft battery.

The ship's <a href="waterline">waterline</a> <a href="belt%20armor">armor belt</a> was thick and tapered to a thickness of at its bottom edge; above it was a <a href="strake">strake</a> of armor. The main <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> armor was while the lower deck was thick. The turrets were protected with an armor thickness of 305 mm on the face, on the sides, and on the roof. The <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s of the turrets were protected by armor 305 mm thick, while the casemates of the 1<a href="QF%202-pounder%20naval%20gun"></a> guns were protected by <a href="Type%2096%2025%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bmm%20AT/AA%20Gun">Type 96</a> armor plates. The sides of the <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> were thick.

The new 41 cm turrets installed during "Nagato"s reconstruction were more heavily armored than the original ones. Face armor was increased to , the sides to , and the roof to . The armor over the machinery and magazines was increased by 38 mm on the upper deck and <a href="Type%2096%2025%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bmm%20AT/AA%20Gun">Type 96</a> on the upper armored deck. These additions increased the weight of the ship's armor to , 32.6 percent of her displacement. In early 1941, as a preparation for war, "Nagato"s barbette armor was reinforced with armor plates above the main deck and plates below it.

When completed in 1920, the ship was fitted with a rangefinder in the forward superstructure; and anti-aircraft rangefinders were added in May 1921 and 1923, respectively. The rangefinders in the second and third turrets were replaced by 10-meter units in 1932–1933.

"Nagato" was initially fitted with a Type 13 fire-control system derived from Vickers equipment received during World War I, but this was replaced by an improved Type 14 system around 1925. It controlled the main and secondary guns; no provision was made for anti-aircraft fire until the Type 31 <a href="fire-control%20director">fire-control director</a> was introduced in 1932. A modified Type 14 fire-control system was tested aboard the ship in 1935 and later approved for service as the Type 34. A new anti-aircraft director called the Type 94 that was used to control the 127 mm AA guns was introduced in 1937, although when "Nagato" received hers is unknown. The <a href="Type%2096%2025%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bmm%20AT/AA%20Gun">Type 96</a> AA guns were controlled by a Type 95 director that was also introduced in 1937.

While in <a href="drydock">drydock</a> in May 1943, a <a href="List%20of%20Japanese%20World%20War%20II%20radar%23Shipborne%20Radar">Type 21</a> air search <a href="radar">radar</a> was installed on the roof of the 10-meter rangefinder at the top of the pagoda mast. On 27 June 1944, two Type 22 surface search radars were installed on the pagoda mast and two Type 13 <a href="early%20warning%20radar">early warning radar</a>s were fitted on her mainmast.

"Nagato" was fitted with an aircraft <a href="Flight%20deck%23Early%20flight%20decks">flying-off platform</a> on Turret No. 2 in August 1925. <a href="Yokosuka%20Ro-go%20Ko-gata">Yokosuka Ro-go Ko-gata</a> and <a href="Heinkel%20HD%2025">Heinkel HD 25</a> <a href="floatplane">floatplane</a>s were tested from it before it was removed early the following year. An additional boom was added to the <a href="mainmast">mainmast</a> in 1926 to handle the <a href="Yokosuka%20E1Y">Yokosuka E1Y</a> now assigned to the ship. A <a href="Hansa-Brandenburg%20W.33">Hansa-Brandenburg W.33</a> floatplane was tested aboard "Nagato" that same year. A <a href="aircraft%20catapult">catapult</a> was fitted between the mainmast and Turret No. 3 in mid-1933, a collapsible <a href="crane%20%28machine%29">crane</a> was installed in a portside <a href="sponson">sponson</a>, and the ship was equipped to operate two or three floatplanes, although no <a href="hangar">hangar</a> was provided. The ship now operated <a href="Nakajima%20E4N">Nakajima E4N2</a> biplanes until they were replaced by <a href="Nakajima%20E8N">Nakajima E8N2</a> biplanes in 1938. A more powerful catapult was installed in November 1938 to handle heavier aircraft, such as the one <a href="Kawanishi%20E7K">Kawanishi E7K</a> that was added in 1939–1940. <a href="Mitsubishi%20F1M">Mitsubishi F1M</a> biplanes replaced the E8Ns on 11 February 1943.

"Nagato", named for <a href="Nagato%20Province">Nagato Province</a>, was ordered on 12 May 1916 and <a href="Keel">laid down</a> at the <a href="Kure%20Naval%20Arsenal">Kure Naval Arsenal</a> on 28 August 1917 as the lead ship of her class. She was <a href="Ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 9 November 1919 by Admiral <a href="Kat%C5%8D%20Tomosabur%C5%8D">Katō Tomosaburō</a>, completed on 15 November 1920 and <a href="Ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> 10 days later with <a href="Captain%20%28naval%29">Captain</a> <a href="Nobutaro%20Iida">Nobutaro Iida</a> in command. "Nagato" was assigned to the 1st Battleship Division and became the flagship of <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="S%C5%8Djir%C5%8D%20Tochinai">Sōjirō Tochinai</a>. On 13 February 1921, the ship was inspected by the <a href="Crown%20Prince">Crown Prince</a>, <a href="Hirohito">Hirohito</a>. Captain <a href="Kanari%20Kabayama">Kanari Kabayama</a> relieved Iida on 1 December 1921. The ship hosted <a href="Marshal%20of%20France">Marshal</a> <a href="Joseph%20Joffre">Joseph Joffre</a> on 18 February 1922 and <a href="Edward%20VIII">Edward</a>, <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a>, and his <a href="aide-de-camp">aide-de-camp</a> <a href="Lieutenant%20%28naval%29">Lieutenant</a> <a href="Louis%20Mountbatten">Louis Mountbatten</a> on 12 April during the prince's visit to Japan.

After the <a href="1923%20Great%20Kant%C5%8D%20earthquake">1923 Great Kantō earthquake</a>, "Nagato" loaded supplies from <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a> for the victims on 4 September. Together with her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a> , she sank the <a href="hulk%20%28ship%29">hulk</a> of the obsolete battleship on 7 September 1924 during gunnery practice in <a href="Tokyo%20Bay">Tokyo Bay</a> in accordance with the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a>. The ship was transferred to the <a href="reserve%20fleet">reserve</a> of the 1st Division on 1 December and became a gunnery training ship. In August 1925, aircraft handling and take-off tests were conducted aboard "Nagato". She was reassigned as the flagship of the Combined Fleet on 1 December, flying the flag of Admiral <a href="Keisuke%20Okada">Keisuke Okada</a>. Captain <a href="Kiyoshi%20Hasegawa%20%28admiral%29">Kiyoshi Hasegawa</a> assumed command of the ship on 1 December 1926.

"Nagato" was again placed in reserve on 1 December 1931 and her anti-aircraft armament was upgraded the following year. In August 1933 the ship participated in fleet maneuvers north of the <a href="Marshall%20Islands">Marshall Islands</a> and she began her first modernization on 1 April 1934. This was completed on 31 January 1936 and "Nagato" was assigned to the 1st Battleship Division of the <a href="1st%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">1st Fleet</a>. During the attempted <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a> on 26 February by <a href="February%2026%20Incident">disgruntled Army officers</a>, the ship was deployed in Tokyo Bay and some of her sailors were landed in support of the government. In August, she transported 1,749 men of the <a href="43rd%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">43rd Infantry Regiment</a> of the <a href="11th%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">11th Infantry Division</a> from <a href="Shikoku">Shikoku</a> to <a href="Shanghai">Shanghai</a> during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Her floatplanes bombed targets in Shanghai on 24 August before she returned to <a href="Sasebo%20Naval%20Base">Sasebo</a> the following day. "Nagato" became a training ship on 1 December until she again became the flagship of the Combined Fleet on 15 December 1938. The ship participated in an Imperial Fleet Review on 11 October 1940. She was refitted in early 1941 in preparation for war.

Admiral <a href="Isoroku%20Yamamoto">Isoroku Yamamoto</a> issued the code phrase ""Niitaka yama nobore"" (Climb <a href="Mount%20Niitaka">Mount Niitaka</a>) on 2 December 1941 from "Nagato" at anchor at <a href="Hashirajima">Hashirajima</a> to signal the <a href="1st%20Air%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29%23Kido%20Butai">1st Air Fleet</a> ("Kido Butai") in the North Pacific to proceed with its attack on <a href="Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a>. When the war started for Japan on 8 December, she <a href="sortie">sortie</a>d for the <a href="Bonin%20Islands">Bonin Islands</a>, along with "Mutsu", the battleships , , , of Battleship Division 2, and the light carrier as distant cover for the withdrawal of the fleet attacking Pearl Harbor, and returned six days later. Yamamoto transferred his flag to the new battleship on 12 February 1942. "Nagato" was briefly refitted 15 March – 9 April at Kure Naval Arsenal.

In June 1942 "Nagato", commanded by Captain <a href="Hideo%20Yano">Hideo Yano</a>, was assigned to the Main Body of the 1st Fleet during the Battle of Midway, together with "Yamato", "Mutsu", "Hosho", the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> , nine destroyers and four auxiliary ships. Following the loss of all four carriers of the 1st Air Fleet on 4 June, Yamamoto attempted to lure the American forces west to within range of the Japanese air groups at <a href="Wake%20Island">Wake Island</a>, and into a night engagement with his surface forces, but the American forces withdrew and "Nagato" saw no action. After rendezvousing with the remnants of the 1st Air Fleet on 6 June, survivors from the aircraft carrier were transferred to "Nagato". On 14 July, the ship was transferred to Battleship Division 2 and she became the flagship of the 1st Fleet. Yano was promoted to Rear Admiral on 1 November and he was replaced by Captain Yonejiro Hisamune nine days later. Nagato remained in Japanese waters training until August 1943. On 2 August Captain <a href="Mikio%20Hayakawa">Mikio Hayakawa</a> assumed command of the ship.

That month, "Nagato", "Yamato", "Fusō" and the <a href="escort%20carrier">escort carrier</a> , escorted by two heavy cruisers and five destroyers transferred to Truk in the <a href="Caroline%20Islands">Caroline Islands</a>. In response to the carrier raid on <a href="Tarawa">Tarawa</a> on 18 September, "Nagato" and much of the fleet sortied for <a href="Eniwetok">Eniwetok</a> to search for the American forces before they returned to Truk on 23 September, having failed to locate them. The Japanese had intercepted some American radio traffic that suggested an attack on Wake Island, and on 17 October, "Nagato" and the bulk of the 1st Fleet sailed for Eniwetok to be in a position to intercept any such attack. The fleet arrived on 19 October, departed four days later, and arrived back at Truk on 26 October. Hayakawa was promoted to Rear Admiral on 1 November and he was relieved on 25 December by Captain <a href="Yuji%20Kobe">Yuji Kobe</a>.
On 1 February 1944, "Nagato" departed Truk with "Fusō" to avoid an American air raid, and arrived at <a href="Palau">Palau</a> on 4 February. They left on 16 February to escape another air raid. The ships arrived on 21 February at <a href="Lingga%20Island">Lingga Island</a>, near <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>, and the ship became the flagship of Vice Admiral <a href="Matome%20Ugaki">Matome Ugaki</a>, commander of Battleship Division 1, on 25 February until he transferred his flag to "Yamato" on 5 May. Aside from a brief refit at Singapore, the ship remained at Lingga training until 11 May when she was transferred to <a href="Tawitawi">Tawitawi</a> on 12 May. The division was now assigned to the <a href="1st%20Mobile%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">1st Mobile Fleet</a>, under the command of Vice Admiral <a href="Jisabur%C5%8D%20Ozawa">Jisaburō Ozawa</a>.

On 10 June, Battleship Division 1 departed Tawitawi for <a href="Batjan">Batjan</a> in preparation for <a href="Operation%20Kon">Operation Kon</a>, a planned counterattack against the American <a href="Battle%20of%20Biak">invasion of Biak</a>. Three days later, when Admiral <a href="Soemu%20Toyoda">Soemu Toyoda</a>, commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet, was notified of American attacks on <a href="Saipan">Saipan</a>, Operation Kon was canceled and Ugaki's force was diverted to the <a href="Mariana%20Islands">Mariana Islands</a>. The battleships rendezvoused with Ozawa's main force on 16 June. During the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Philippine%20Sea">Battle of the Philippine Sea</a>, "Nagato" escorted the aircraft carriers , and the light carrier . She fired 41 cm Type 3 "Sankaidan" incendiary anti-aircraft <a href="shrapnel%20shell">shrapnel shell</a>s at aircraft from the light carrier that were attacking "Jun'yō" and claimed to have shot down two <a href="Grumman%20TBF%20Avenger">Grumman TBF Avenger</a> <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a>s. The ship was <a href="strafe">strafe</a>d by American aircraft during the battle, but was not damaged and suffered no casualties. During the battle "Nagato" rescued survivors from "Hiyō" that were transferred to the carrier once the ship reached Okinawa on 22 June. She continued on to Kure where she was refitted with additional radars and light AA guns. Undocked on 8 July, "Nagato" loaded a <a href="regiment">regiment</a> of the <a href="28th%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">28th Infantry Division</a> the following day and delivered them to Okinawa on 11 July. She arrived at Lingga via <a href="Manila">Manila</a> on 20 July.

Kobe was promoted to Rear Admiral on 15 October. Three days later, "Nagato" sailed for <a href="Brunei%20Bay">Brunei Bay</a>, <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a>, to join the main Japanese fleet in preparation for "Operation "Sho"-1", the counterattack planned against the American landings at Leyte. The Japanese plan called for Ozawa's carrier forces to lure the American carrier fleets north of Leyte so that Vice Admiral <a href="Takeo%20Kurita">Takeo Kurita</a>'s 1st Diversion Force (also known as the Center Force) could enter <a href="Leyte%20Gulf">Leyte Gulf</a> and destroy American forces landing on the island. "Nagato", together with the rest of Kurita's force, departed Brunei for the Philippines on 22 October.

In the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Sibuyan%20Sea">Battle of the Sibuyan Sea</a> on 24 October, "Nagato" was attacked by multiple waves of American <a href="dive%20bombers">dive bombers</a> and <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighters</a>. At 14:16 she was hit by two bombs dropped by planes from the <a href="fleet%20carrier">fleet carrier</a> and the light carrier . The first bomb disabled five of her casemate guns, jammed one of her Type 89 gun mounts, and damaged the air intake to No. 1 boiler room, immobilizing one propeller shaft for 24 minutes until the boiler was put back on line. Damage from the second bomb is unknown. The two bombs killed 52 men between them; the number of wounded is not known.
On the morning of 25 October, the 1st Diversion Force passed through the <a href="San%20Bernardino%20Strait">San Bernardino Strait</a> and headed for Leyte Gulf to attack the American forces supporting the invasion. In the <a href="Battle%20off%20Samar">Battle off Samar</a>, "Nagato" engaged the escort carriers and destroyers of <a href="Task%20Group">Task Group</a> 77.4.3, codenamed "Taffy 3". At 06:01 she opened fire on three escort carriers, the first time she had ever fired her guns at an enemy ship, but missed. At 06:54 the destroyer fired a spread of torpedoes at the <a href="fast%20battleship">fast battleship</a> ; the torpedoes missed "Haruna" and headed for "Yamato" and "Nagato" which were on a parallel course. The two battleships were forced 10 miles (16 km) away from the engagement before the torpedoes ran out of fuel. Turning back, "Nagato" engaged the American escort carriers and their screening ships, claiming to have damaged one <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a> with forty-five 410 mm and ninety-two 14 cm shells. The ineffectiveness of her shooting was the result of the poor visibility caused by numerous rain <a href="squall">squall</a>s and by <a href="smoke%20screen">smoke screen</a>s laid by the defending escorts. At 09:10 Kurita ordered his ships to break off the engagement and head north. At 10:20 he ordered the fleet south once more, but as they came under increasingly severe air attack he ordered a retreat again at 12:36. At 12:43 "Nagato" was hit in the bow by two bombs, but the damage was not severe. Four <a href="gunner%20%28artillery%29">gunners</a> were washed overboard at 16:56 as the ship made a sharp turn to avoid dive-bomber attacks; a destroyer was detached to rescue them, but they could not be found. As it retreated back to Brunei on 26 October, the Japanese fleet came under repeated air attacks. "Nagato" and "Yamato" used "Sankaidan" shells against them and claimed to have shot down several bombers. Over the course of the last two days she fired ninety-nine 410 mm and six hundred fifty-three 14 cm shells, suffering 38 crewmen killed and 105 wounded during the same time.

On 15 November the ship was assigned to Battleship Division 3 of the <a href="2nd%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">2nd Fleet</a>. After an aerial attack at Brunei on 16 November, "Nagato", "Yamato", and the fast battleship left the following day, bound for Kure. En route, "Kongō" and one of the escorting destroyers was sunk by on 21 November. On 25 November, she arrived at <a href="Yokosuka%20%28city%29">Yokosuka</a>, Japan, for repairs. Lack of fuel and materials meant that she could not be brought back into service and she was turned into a <a href="floating%20battery">floating anti-aircraft battery</a>. Her funnel and mainmast were removed to improve the arcs of fire of her AA guns, which were increased by two Type 89 mounts and nine triple Type 96 gun mounts. Her forward secondary guns were removed in compensation. Captain Kiyomi Shibuya relieved Kobe in command of "Nagato" on 25 November. Battleship Division 3 was disbanded on 1 January 1945 and the ship was reassigned to Battleship Division 1. That formation was disbanded on 10 February and she was assigned to the <a href="Yokosuka%20Naval%20District">Yokosuka Naval District</a> as a <a href="coastal%20defense%20ship">coastal defense ship</a>. <a href="wikt%3Amoor">Moored</a> alongside a <a href="pier">pier</a>, a coal-burning <a href="donkey%20boiler">donkey boiler</a> was installed on the pier for heating and cooking purposes and a converted <a href="submarine%20chaser">submarine chaser</a> was positioned alongside to provide steam and electricity; her anti-aircraft guns lacked full power and were only partially operational. On 20 April, "Nagato" was reduced to reserve and retired Rear Admiral <a href="Miki%20Otsuka">Miki Otsuka</a> assumed command a week later.

In June 1945, all of her secondary guns and about half of her anti-aircraft armament was moved ashore, together with her rangefinders and <a href="searchlight">searchlight</a>s. Her crew was accordingly reduced to less than 1,000 officers and enlisted men. On 18 July 1945, the heavily camouflaged ship <a href="Attack%20on%20Yokosuka">was attacked</a> by fighter bombers and torpedo bombers from five American carriers as part of Admiral <a href="William%20Halsey%2C%20Jr.">William Halsey, Jr.</a>'s campaign to destroy the IJN's last surviving <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>s. "Nagato" was hit by two bombs, the first bomb struck the bridge and killed Otsuka, the <a href="executive%20officer">executive officer</a>, and twelve sailors when it detonated upon hitting the roof of the conning tower. The second 500-pound bomb struck the deck aft of the mainmast and detonated when it hit No. 3 barbette. It failed to damage the barbette or the turret above it, but blew a hole nearly in diameter in the deck above the officer's lounge, killing 21 men and damaging four Type 96 guns on the deck above. A <a href="dud">dud</a> <a href="rocket">rocket</a> of uncertain size hit the ship's fantail, but failed to do any significant damage. To convince the Americans that "Nagato" had been badly damaged by the attack, her damage was left unrepaired and some of her <a href="ballast%20tank">ballast tank</a>s were pumped full of seawater to make her sit deeper in the water as if she had sunk to the harbor bottom.
Captain Shuichi Sugino was appointed as "Nagato"s new captain on 24 July, but he was unable to take up his appointment until 20 August. Retired Rear Admiral <a href="Masamichi%20Ikeguchi">Masamichi Ikeguchi</a> was assigned as the ship's interim captain until Sugino arrived. The Yokosuka Naval District received an alarm on the night of 1/2 August that a large convoy was approaching <a href="Sagami%20Bay">Sagami Bay</a> and "Nagato" was ordered to attack immediately. The ship was totally unprepared for any attack, but Ikeguchi began the necessary preparations. The water in the ballast compartments was pumped out and her crew began reloading the propellant charges for her 16-inch guns. The ship received more fuel from a barge later that morning, but no order to attack ever came as it had been a false alarm. Sailors from the battleship , <a href="Underwater%20Demolition%20Team">Underwater Demolition Team</a> 18, and the high-speed transport secured the battleship on 30 August after the <a href="Japanese%20surrender">occupation began</a> and Captain Cornelius Flynn, executive officer of the "Iowa", assumed command. By the time the war ended, "Nagato" was the only Japanese battleship still afloat. She was stricken from the <a href="Navy%20List">Navy List</a> on 15 September.

The ship was selected to participate as a target ship in <a href="Operation%20Crossroads">Operation Crossroads</a>, a series of nuclear weapon tests held at <a href="Bikini%20Atoll">Bikini Atoll</a> in mid-1946. In mid-March, "Nagato" departed Yokosuka for Eniwetok under the command of Captain W. J. Whipple with an American crew of about 180 men supplementing her Japanese crew. The ship was only capable of a speed of from her two operating <a href="propeller%20shaft">propeller shaft</a>s. Her hull had not been repaired from the underwater damage sustained during the attack on 18 July and she leaked enough that her pumps could not keep up. Her consort, the light cruiser , broke down on 28 March and "Nagato" attempted to take her in tow, but one of her boilers malfunctioned and the ship ran out of fuel in bad weather. The ship had a <a href="list%20%28watercraft%29">list</a> of seven degrees to port by the time <a href="tugboat">tugboat</a>s from Eniwetok arrived on 30 March. Towed at a speed of , the ship reached Eniwetok on 4 April where she received temporary repairs. On her trip to Bikini in May, "Nagato" reached .
Operation Crossroads began with the first blast (Test Able), an <a href="air%20burst">air burst</a> on 1 July; she was from <a href="ground%20zero">ground zero</a> and was only lightly damaged. A <a href="skeleton%20crew">skeleton crew</a> boarded "Nagato" to assess the damage and prepare her for the next test on 25 July. As a test, they operated one of her boilers for 36 hours without any problems. For Test Baker, an <a href="underwater%20explosion">underwater explosion</a>, the ship was positioned from ground zero. "Nagato" rode out the <a href="tsunami">tsunami</a> from the explosion with little apparent damage; she had a slight starboard list of two degrees after the tsunami dissipated. A more thorough assessment could not be made because she was dangerously <a href="radioactive">radioactive</a>. Her list gradually increased over the next five days and she capsized and sank during the night of 29/30 July.

The wreck is upside down and her most prominent features are her four propellers, at a depth of below the surface. She has become a <a href="scuba%20diving">scuba diving</a> destination in recent years and "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" named "Nagato" as one of the top ten <a href="wreck%20diving">wreck diving</a> sites in the world in 2007.

Japanese battleship Mutsu

Mutsu was the second and last <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a> built for the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> (IJN) at the end of World War I. It was named after the <a href="Mutsu%20Province">province</a>, In 1923 she carried supplies for the survivors of the <a href="1923%20Great%20Kant%C5%8D%20earthquake">Great Kantō earthquake</a>. The ship was modernized in 1934–1936 with improvements to her armour and machinery, and a rebuilt superstructure in the <a href="pagoda%20mast">pagoda mast</a> style.

Other than participating in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Eastern%20Solomons">Battle of the Eastern Solomons</a> in 1942, where she did not see any significant combat, "Mutsu" spent most of the first year of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a> in training. She returned to Japan in early 1943. That June, one of her aft <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a>s detonated while she was at anchor, sinking the ship with the loss of 1,121 crew and visitors. The IJN investigation into the cause of her loss concluded that it was the work of a disgruntled crew member. The navy dispersed the survivors in an attempt to conceal the sinking in the interest of morale in Japan. Much of the wreck was <a href="marine%20salvage">scrapped</a> after the war, but some artefacts and relics are on display in Japan, and a small portion of the ship remains where it was sunk. 

"Mutsu" had a length of <a href="length%20between%20perpendiculars">between perpendiculars</a> and <a href="length%20overall">overall</a>. She had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draught</a> of . The ship <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> at <a href="Standard%20displacement%23Standard%20displacement">standard load</a> and at <a href="Full-load%20displacement">full load</a>. Her crew consisted of 1,333 officers and enlisted men as built and 1,368 in 1935. The crew totalled around 1,475 men in 1942.

In 1927, "Mutsu"s <a href="bow%20%28ship%29">bow</a> was remodelled to reduce the amount of spray produced when steaming into a <a href="head%20sea">head sea</a>. This increased her overall length by to . During her 1934–1936 reconstruction, the ship's <a href="stern">stern</a> was lengthened by to improve her speed, and her forward superstructure was rebuilt into a <a href="pagoda%20mast">pagoda mast</a>. She was given <a href="torpedo%20bulge">torpedo bulge</a>s to improve her underwater protection and to compensate for the weight of the additional armour and equipment. These changes increased her overall length to , her beam to and her draught to . Her displacement increased over to at deep load.

"Mutsu" was equipped with four Gihon geared <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s, each of which drove one <a href="propeller">propeller</a> shaft. The turbines were designed to produce a total of , using steam provided by 21 Kampon <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s; 15 of these were oil-fired, and the remaining half-dozen consumed a mixture of coal and oil. The ship had a stowage capacity of of coal and of fuel oil, giving her a range of at a speed of . The ship exceeded her designed speed of during her <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s, reaching at .

During a <a href="refit">refit</a> in 1924 the fore <a href="funnel%20%28ship%29">funnel</a> was rebuilt in a serpentine shape in an unsuccessful effort to prevent smoke interference with the <a href="bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a> and <a href="fire-control%20system">fire-control system</a>s. That funnel was eliminated during the ship's 1930s reconstruction when all of her existing boilers were replaced by ten lighter and more powerful oil-fired Kampon boilers, which had working pressures of and temperatures of . In addition her turbines were replaced by lighter, more modern, units. When "Mutsu" conducted her post-reconstruction trials, she reached a speed of with . Additional fuel oil was stored in the bottoms of the newly added torpedo bulges, which increased her capacity to and thus her range to at 16 <a href="knot%20%28unit%29">knots</a>.

"Mutsu"s eight 45-<a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">calibre</a> <a href="41%20cm/45%203rd%20Year%20Type%20naval%20gun">41-centimetre</a> guns were mounted in two pairs of twin-gun, <a href="superfire">superfiring</a> turrets fore and aft. Numbered one to four from front to rear, the hydraulically powered turrets gave the guns an elevation range of −2 to +35 degrees. The rate of fire for the guns was around two rounds per minute. A special <a href="San%20Shiki%20%28anti-aircraft%20shell%29">Type 3 "Sankaidan"</a> incendiary <a href="shrapnel%20shell">shrapnel shell</a> was developed in the 1930s for anti-aircraft use. The turrets aboard the "Nagato"-class ships were replaced in the mid-1930s using those stored from the unfinished s. While in storage the turrets were modified to increase their range of elevation to −3 degrees to +43 degrees, which increased the guns' maximum range from .

The ship's secondary armament of twenty 50-calibre <a href="14%20cm/50%203rd%20Year%20Type%20naval%20gun">14-centimetre guns</a> was mounted in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s on the upper sides of the hull and in the superstructure. The manually operated guns had a maximum range of and fired at a rate of six to ten rounds per minute. <a href="Anti-aircraft%20defence">Anti-aircraft defence</a> was provided by four 40-calibre <a href="8%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bcm/40%203rd%20Year%20Type%20naval%20gun">8-centimetre 3rd Year Type</a> <a href="AA%20gun">AA gun</a>s in single mounts. These guns had a maximum elevation of +75 degrees, and a rate of fire of 13 to 20 rounds per minute. The ship was also fitted with eight <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, four on each <a href="broadside">broadside</a>, two above water and two submerged.
Around 1926, the four above-water torpedo tubes were removed and the ship received three additional 76 mm AA guns that were situated around the base of the foremast. The 76 mm AA guns were replaced by eight 40-calibre <a href="12.7%20cm/40%20Type%2089%20naval%20gun">127-millimeter</a> <a href="dual-purpose%20gun">dual-purpose gun</a>s in 1932, fitted on both sides of the fore and aft superstructures in four twin-gun mounts. When firing at surface targets, the guns had a range of ; they had a maximum ceiling of at their maximum elevation of +90 degrees. Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute, but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute. Two twin-gun mounts for licence-built <a href="Vickers">Vickers</a> <a href="QF%202%20pounder%20naval%20gun">two-pounder</a> light AA guns were also added to the ship in 1932. These guns had a maximum elevation of +80 degrees, which gave them a ceiling of . They had a maximum rate of fire of 200 rounds per minute.

The two-pounders were replaced by 1941 by 20 licence-built <a href="25%20mm%20Hotchkiss%20anti-aircraft%20gun">Hotchkiss</a> <a href="Type%2096%2025%20mm%20AT/AA%20Gun">25 mm Type 96</a> light AA guns in five twin-gun mounts. This was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II, but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon. According to historian Mark Stille, the twin and triple mounts "lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets; the gun exhibited excessive vibration; the magazine was too small, and, finally, the gun produced excessive muzzle blast". These guns had an effective range of , and an effective ceiling of at an elevation of 85 degrees. The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the 15-round magazines.

The ship's waterline <a href="belt%20armor">armour belt</a> was thick and tapered to a thickness of at its bottom edge; above it was a <a href="strake">strake</a> of armour. The main <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> armour was while the lower deck was thick. The turrets were protected with an armour thickness of 305 mm on the face, on the sides, and on the roof. The <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s of the turrets were protected by armour 305 mm thick, and the casemates of the 140 mm guns were protected by 25 mm armour plates. The sides of the <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> were thick.

The new 41 cm turrets installed during "Mutsu"s reconstruction were more heavily armoured than the original ones. Face armour was increased to , the sides to , and the roof to . The armour over the machinery and magazines was increased by 38 mm on the upper deck and 25 mm on the upper armoured deck. These additions increased the weight of the ship's armour to , 32.6 percent of her displacement. In early 1941, in preparation for war, "Mutsu"s barbette armour was reinforced with armour plates above the main deck and plates below it.

"Mutsu" had an additional <a href="crane%20%28machine%29">boom</a> added to the <a href="mainmast">mainmast</a> in 1926 to handle the <a href="Yokosuka%20E1Y">Yokosuka E1Y</a> <a href="floatplane">floatplane</a> recently assigned to the ship. In 1933 a <a href="aircraft%20catapult">catapult</a> was fitted between the mainmast and Turret No. 3, and a collapsible <a href="crane%20%28machine%29">crane</a> was installed in a port-side <a href="sponson">sponson</a> the following year; the ship was equipped to operate two or three seaplanes, although no <a href="hangar">hangar</a> was provided. The ship was operating <a href="Nakajima%20E4N">Nakajima E4N2</a> biplanes until they were replaced by <a href="Nakajima%20E8N">Nakajima E8N2</a> biplanes in 1938. A more powerful catapult was installed in November 1938 to handle heavier aircraft like the single <a href="Kawanishi%20E7K">Kawanishi E7K</a>, added in 1939–40. <a href="Mitsubishi%20F1M">Mitsubishi F1M</a> biplanes replaced the E8Ns on 11 February 1943.

The ship was fitted with a rangefinder in the forward superstructure. Additional and anti-aircraft rangefinders were also fitted, although the date is unknown. The rangefinders in No. 2 and 3 turrets were replaced by 10-metre units in 1932–33.

"Mutsu" was initially fitted with a Type 13 fire-control system derived from Vickers equipment received during World War I, but this was replaced by an improved Type 14 system around 1925. It controlled the main and secondary guns; no provision was made for anti-aircraft fire until the Type 31 <a href="fire-control%20director">fire-control director</a> was introduced in 1932. A modified Type 14 fire-control system was tested aboard her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a> in 1935 and later approved for service as the Type 94. A new anti-aircraft director, also called the Type 94, used to control the 127 mm AA guns, was introduced in 1937, although when "Mutsu" received hers is unknown. The 25 mm AA guns were controlled by a Type 95 director that was also introduced in 1937.

"Mutsu", named for <a href="Mutsu%20Province">Mutsu Province</a>, was <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> at the <a href="Yokosuka%20Naval%20Arsenal">Yokosuka Naval Arsenal</a> on 1 June 1918 and <a href="Ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 31 May 1920. Funding for the ship had partly come from donations from schoolchildren. While "Mutsu" was still <a href="fitting%20out">fitting out</a>, the American government called a conference in Washington, D.C. late in 1921 to forestall the expensive naval arms race that was developing between the United States, the United Kingdom and the Empire of Japan. The <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Conference">Washington Naval Conference</a> convened on 12 November and the Americans proposed to <a href="ship%20breaking">scrap</a> virtually every <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a> under construction or being fitted out by the participating nations. "Mutsu" was specifically listed among those to be scrapped even though she had been commissioned a few weeks earlier. This was unacceptable to the Japanese delegates; they agreed to a compromise that allowed them to keep "Mutsu" in exchange for scrapping the obsolete <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a> , with a similar arrangement for several American dreadnoughts that were fitting out. "Mutsu" was <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> on 24 October 1921 with <a href="captain%20%28naval%29">Captain</a> <a href="Shizen%20Komaki">Shizen Komaki</a> in command. Captain <a href="Seiichi%20Kurose">Seiichi Kurose</a> assumed command on 18 November and the ship was assigned to the 1st Battleship Division on 1 December. "Mutsu" hosted <a href="Edward%20VIII">Edward</a>, <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a>, and his <a href="aide-de-camp">aide-de-camp</a> and second cousin, <a href="lieutenant%20%28naval%29">Lieutenant</a> <a href="Louis%20Mountbatten%2C%201st%20Earl%20Mountbatten%20of%20Burma">Louis Mountbatten</a>, on 12 April 1922 during the prince's visit to Japan.

On 4 September 1923, "Mutsu" loaded supplies at <a href="Uchinoura%20Bay">Uchinoura Bay</a>, <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a>, for the victims of the <a href="1923%20Great%20Kant%C5%8D%20earthquake">Great Kantō earthquake</a>. With her sister "Nagato", she sank the <a href="hulk%20%28ship%29">hulk</a> of the obsolete battleship on 7 September 1924 during gunnery practice in <a href="Tokyo%20Bay">Tokyo Bay</a>, in accordance with the Washington Naval Treaty. Captain <a href="Mitsumasa%20Yonai">Mitsumasa Yonai</a>, later <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Japan">Prime Minister of Japan</a>, assumed command on 10 November. The ship was transferred to the <a href="reserve%20fleet">reserve</a> on 1 December 1925. "Mutsu" served as flagship of <a href="Emperor%20of%20Japan">Emperor</a> <a href="Hirohito">Hirohito</a> during the 1927 naval manoeuvres and fleet review. Captain <a href="Zengo%20Yoshida">Zengo Yoshida</a> relieved Captain <a href="Teikichi%20Hori">Teikichi Hori</a> on 10 December 1928. On 29 March 1929, the ship was assigned to Battleship Division 3, together with three <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a>s.

"Mutsu"s anti-aircraft armament was upgraded during 1932. Upon completion, she was assigned to Battleship Division 1 of the <a href="1st%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">1st Fleet</a>, and again served as the Emperor's flagship during the annual maneuvers and fleet review in 1933. The ship was placed in reserve on 15 November and began her lengthy reconstruction. This was completed on 30 September 1936 and "Mutsu" rejoined the 1st Battleship Division on 1 December 1936. In August 1937, she transported 2,000 men of the <a href="11th%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">11th Infantry Division</a> to <a href="Shanghai">Shanghai</a> during the <a href="Second%20Sino-Japanese%20War">Second Sino-Japanese War</a>. Her seaplanes bombed targets in Shanghai on 24 August before she returned to <a href="Sasebo%20Naval%20District">Sasebo</a> the following day. On 15 November 1938, Captain <a href="Aritomo%20Got%C5%8D">Aritomo Gotō</a> assumed command of the ship. "Mutsu" was placed in reserve from 15 December 1938 to 15 November 1939. She was refitted in early 1941 in preparation for war; as part of this work, she was fitted with external <a href="degaussing">degaussing</a> coils and additional armour for her barbettes.

During the war "Mutsu" saw limited action, spending much of her time in home waters. On 8 December 1941, she <a href="sortie">sortie</a>d for the <a href="Bonin%20Islands">Bonin Islands</a>, along with "Nagato", the battleships , , , of Battleship Division 2, and the light carrier as distant support for the fleet <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attacking Pearl Harbor</a>, and returned six days later. On 18 January 1942, "Mutsu" towed the obsolete <a href="armoured%20cruiser">armoured cruiser</a> as a target for the new battleship , which promptly sank "Nisshin".

In June 1942 "Mutsu", commanded by <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Gunji%20Kogure">Gunji Kogure</a>, was assigned to the Main Body of the 1st Fleet during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a>, together with "Yamato", "Nagato", "Hōshō", the light cruiser <a href="Japanese%20cruiser%20Sendai">"Sendai"</a>, nine destroyers and four auxiliary ships. Following the loss of all four carriers on 4 June, Yamamoto attempted to lure the American forces west to within range of the Japanese air groups at <a href="Wake%20Island">Wake Island</a>, and into a night engagement with his surface forces, but the American forces withdrew and "Mutsu" saw no action. After rendezvousing with the remnants of the striking force on 6 June, about half of the survivors from the sunken aircraft carriers of the <a href="1st%20Air%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29%23Kido%20Butai">1st Air Fleet</a> were transferred to "Mutsu". She arrived at <a href="Hashirajima">Hashirajima</a> on 14 June.

On 14 July, "Mutsu" was transferred to Battleship Division 2 and then to the advance force of the <a href="2nd%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">2nd Fleet</a> on 9 August. Two days later, the ship departed <a href="Yokosuka">Yokosuka</a> accompanied by the cruisers , , , , , , the seaplane tender and escorting destroyers to support operations during the <a href="Guadalcanal%20Campaign">Guadalcanal Campaign</a>. They arrived at <a href="Chuuk%20State">Truk</a> on 17 August. On 20 August, while sailing from Truk to rendezvous with the main body of <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Ch%C5%ABichi%20Nagumo">Chūichi Nagumo</a>'s <a href="3rd%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">3rd Fleet</a>, "Mutsu", the heavy cruiser "Atago", and escorting destroyers unsuccessfully attempted to locate the <a href="escort%20carrier">escort carrier</a> in response to a flying boat detecting the American ship.

During the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Eastern%20Solomons">Battle of the Eastern Solomons</a> on 27 August, "Mutsu", assigned to the support force, fired four shells at enemy <a href="reconnaissance%20aircraft">reconnaissance aircraft</a> during what was her first and only time her guns were fired in anger during the war. Following her return to Truk on 2 September, a group of skilled AA gunnery officers and men were detached to serve as instructors to ground-based naval anti-aircraft gunners stationed in <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a>. During October "Mutsu" off-loaded surplus fuel oil to the fleet oil tanker "<a href="Kenyo%20Maru">Kenyo Maru</a>", allowing the tanker to refuel other ships involved in Guadalcanal operations. On 7 January 1943, "Mutsu" steamed from Truk via <a href="Saipan">Saipan</a> to return to Japan together with the carrier , the heavy cruiser and four destroyers. "Mutsu" left Hashirajima for <a href="Kure">Kure</a> on 13 April, where she prepared to sortie to reinforce the Japanese garrisons in the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian Islands</a> in response to the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Komandorski%20Islands">Battle of the Komandorski Islands</a>. The operation was cancelled the next day and the ship resumed training.

On 8 June 1943, "Mutsu" was moored in the Hashirajima fleet anchorage, with 113 <a href="flying%20cadet">flying cadet</a>s and 40 instructors from the Tsuchiura Naval Air Group aboard for familiarisation. At 12:13 the magazine of her No. 3 turret exploded, destroying the adjacent structure of the ship and cutting her in half. A massive influx of water into the machinery spaces caused the forward section of the ship to <a href="capsize">capsize</a> to starboard and sink almost immediately. The stern section upended and remained floating until about 02:00 hours on 9 June before sinking, coming to rest a few hundred feet south of the main wreck at coordinates .

The nearby "Fusō" immediately launched two boats which, together with the destroyers and and the cruisers and , rescued 353 survivors from the 1,474 crew members and visitors aboard "Mutsu"; 1,121 men were killed in the explosion. Only 13 of the visiting aviators were among the survivors.

After the explosion, as the rescue operations commenced, the fleet was alerted and the area was searched for <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> submarines, but no traces were found. To avert the potential damage to morale from the loss of a battleship so soon after the string of recent setbacks in the war effort, "Mutsu"s destruction was declared a state secret. Mass <a href="Japanese%20funeral">cremations</a> of recovered bodies began almost immediately after the sinking. Captain Teruhiko Miyoshi's body was recovered by divers on 17 June, but his wife was not officially notified until 6 January 1944. Both he and his second in command, Captain Ono Koro, were posthumously promoted to rear admiral, as was normal practice. To further prevent rumours from spreading, healthy and recovered survivors were reassigned to various garrisons in the Pacific Ocean. Some of the survivors were sent to Truk in the <a href="Caroline%20Islands">Caroline Islands</a> and assigned to the 41st Guard Force. Another 150 were sent to Saipan in the <a href="Mariana%20Islands">Mariana Islands</a>, where most were killed in 1944 during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Saipan">battle for the island</a>.

At the time of the explosion, "Mutsu"s magazine contained some 16-inch Type 3 "Sanshikidan" incendiary shrapnel shells, which had caused a fire at the <a href="Sagami%20General%20Depot">Sagami arsenal</a> several years earlier due to improper storage. Because they might have been the cause of the explosion, the minister of the navy, Admiral <a href="Shigetar%C5%8D%20Shimada">Shimada Shigetaro</a>, immediately ordered the removal of Type 3 shells from all IJN ships carrying them, until the conclusion of the investigation into the loss.

A commission led by Admiral <a href="K%C5%8Dichi%20Shiozawa">Kōichi Shiozawa</a> was convened three days after the sinking to investigate the loss. The commission considered several possible causes:


The commission issued its preliminary conclusions on 25 June, well before the divers had completed their investigation of the wreck, and concluded that the explosion was the result of a disgruntled seaman. Historian Mike Williams put forward an alternative theory of fire:

A number of observers noted smoke coming from the vicinity of No. 3 turret and the aircraft area just forward of it, just before the explosion. Compared with other nations' warships in wartime service, Japanese battleships contained a large amount of flammable materials including wooden decking, furniture, and insulation, as well as cotton and wool bedding. Although she had been modernized in the 1930s, some of the "Mutsu"s original electrical wiring may have remained in use. While fire in the secure magazines was a very remote possibility, a fire in an area adjacent to the No. 3 magazine could have raised the temperature to a level sufficient to ignite the highly sensitive <a href="black%20powder">black-powder</a> <a href="primer%20%28firearm%29">primer</a>s stored in the magazine and thus cause the explosion.

Divers were brought into the area to retrieve bodies and to assess the damage to the ship. Prior to diving on the wreck they were allowed to familiarize themselves on board "Mutsu"s sister ship, "Nagato". The Navy leadership initially gave serious consideration to raising the wreck and rebuilding her, although these plans were dropped after the divers completed their survey of the ship on 22 July. Thus "Mutsu" was struck from the <a href="Navy%20List">Navy List</a> on 1 September. As part of the investigation, Dive-boat No. 3746, a small "Nishimura"-class <a href="combat%20search%20and%20rescue">search and rescue</a> submarine, explored the wreck on 17 June with a crew of seven officers. While crawling on the harbour bottom, it became snagged on the wreckage and its crew nearly suffocated before they could free themselves and surface. In July 1944, the oil-starved IJN recovered of fuel from the wreck.

The diameter <a href="chrysanthemum">chrysanthemum</a> crest, symbol of the <a href="Chrysanthemum%20Throne">Imperial Throne</a>, was raised in 1953 but lost or scrapped shortly thereafter. One of the 140 mm casemate guns was raised in 1963 and donated to the <a href="Yasukuni%20Shrine">Yasukuni Shrine</a>. In 1970, the Fukada Salvage Company began <a href="marine%20salvage">salvage</a> operations that lasted until 1978 and scrapped about 75% of the ship. The two aft turrets were raised in 1970 and 1971. Despite the fact that the salvaged components were remarkably preserved, in particular the two gun turrets, bow (including chrysanthemum mount) and stern (with every propeller, and intact rudders and steering gear), the entirety of the ship was broken up to farm low-radiation steel and sold to an anonymous "research institute." The salvagers retrieved 849 bodies of crewmen lost during the explosion. In 1995, the Mutsu Memorial Museum declared that no further salvage operations were planned.

The only significant portion of the ship that remains is a long section running from the bridge structure forward to the vicinity of No. 1 turret. The highest portion of the ship is below the surface.

In addition to the 140 mm gun donated to the Yasukuni Shrine, now on display at the <a href="Y%C5%ABsh%C5%ABkan">Yasukuni Museum</a>, the following items recovered over the years can be viewed at various museums and memorials in Japan:

Sandringham House

Sandringham House is a <a href="English%20country%20house">country house</a> in the parish of <a href="Sandringham%2C%20Norfolk">Sandringham, Norfolk</a>, England. It is the private home of <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a>, whose father, <a href="George%20VI">George VI</a>, and grandfather, <a href="George%20V">George V</a>, both died there. The house stands in a estate in the <a href="Norfolk%20Coast%20AONB">Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</a>. The house is listed as <a href="listed%20building">Grade II*</a> along with its landscaped gardens, park, and woodlands.

The site has been occupied since <a href="Elizabethan%20era">Elizabethan</a> times, when a large <a href="manor">manor</a> was constructed. This was replaced in 1771 by a <a href="Georgian%20architecture">Georgian</a> mansion for the owners, the Hoste Henleys. In 1836, Sandringham was bought by John Motteux, a London merchant, who already owned property in Norfolk and <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a>. Motteux had no direct heir, and on his death in 1843, his entire estate was left to Charles Spencer Cowper, the son of Motteux's close friend <a href="Emily%20Temple%2C%20Viscountess%20Palmerston">Emily Temple, Viscountess Palmerston</a>. Cowper sold the Norfolk and the Surrey estates and embarked on rebuilding at Sandringham. He led an extravagant life, and by the early 1860s, the estate was mortgaged and he and his wife spent most of their time on the Continent.

In 1862, Sandringham and just under 8,000 acres of land were purchased for <a href="Edward%20VII">Albert Edward</a>, <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a>, later Edward VII, as a country home for him and his fiancée, Princess <a href="Alexandra%20of%20Denmark">Alexandra of Denmark</a>. Between 1870 and 1900, the house was almost completely rebuilt in a style described by <a href="Pevsner%20Architectural%20Guides">Pevsner</a> as "<a href="Jacobethan">frenetic Jacobean</a>". Edward also developed the estate, creating one of the finest <a href="hunting%23Shooting%20traditions">shoots</a> in England. Following his death in 1910, the estate passed to Edward's son and heir, George V, who described the house as "dear old Sandringham, the place I love better than anywhere else in the world". It was the setting for the first <a href="Royal%20Christmas%20Message">Christmas broadcast</a> in 1932. George died at the house on 20 January 1936. The estate passed to his son <a href="Edward%20VIII">Edward VIII</a>; and at the <a href="Edward%20VIII%20abdication%20crisis">abdication</a>, as the private property of the monarch, it was purchased by Edward's brother, George VI. George was as devoted to the house as his father, writing to his mother <a href="Mary%20of%20Teck">Queen Mary</a>, "I have always been so happy here and I love the place". He died at Sandringham on 6 February 1952.

On the King's death, Sandringham passed to his daughter Elizabeth II. The Queen spends most of the winter at the house, including the anniversary of her father's death and of her own accession. In 1957 she broadcast her first televised Christmas message from Sandringham. In the 1960s, plans were drawn up to demolish the house and replace it with a modern building, but these were not carried out. In 1977, for her <a href="Silver%20Jubilee%20of%20Queen%20Elizabeth%20II">Silver Jubilee</a>, the Queen opened the house and grounds to the public for the first time. Unlike the royal palaces, such as <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> and <a href="Windsor%20Castle">Windsor Castle</a>, Sandringham and <a href="Balmoral%20Castle">Balmoral Castle</a> are the Queen's private homes.

Sandringham is recorded in the <a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a> as "sant-Dersingham" and the land was awarded to a <a href="House%20of%20Normandy">Norman</a> knight, Robert Fitz-Corbun after the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Conquest</a>. The local antiquarian Claude Messent, in his study "The Architecture on the Royal Estate of Sandringham", records the discovery of evidence of the pavements of a Roman villa. In the <a href="Elizabethan%20era">Elizabethan era</a> a manor was built on the site of the present house, which, by the 18th century, came into the possession of the Hoste Henley family, descendants of Dutch refugees. In 1771 Cornish Henley cleared the site to build a Georgian mansion, Sandringham Hall. In 1834, Henry Hoste Henley died without issue, and the estate was bought at auction by John Motteux, a London merchant. Motteux was also without heirs and bequeathed Sandringham, together with another Norfolk estate and a property in Surrey, to the third son of his close friend, Emily Lamb, the wife of <a href="Henry%20John%20Temple%2C%203rd%20Viscount%20Palmerston">Lord Palmerston</a>. At the time of his inheritance in 1843, Charles Spencer Cowper was a bachelor diplomat, resident in Paris. On succeeding to Motteux's estates, he sold the other properties and based himself at Sandringham. He undertook extensions to the hall, employing <a href="Samuel%20Sanders%20Teulon">Samuel Sanders Teulon</a> to add an elaborate porch and conservatory. Cowper's style of living was extravagant—he and his wife spent much of their time on the Continent—and within 10 years the estate was mortgaged for £89,000. The death of their only child, Mary Harriette, from cholera in 1854 led the couple to spend even more time abroad, mainly in Paris, and by the early 1860s Cowper was keen to sell the estate.

In 1861 Queen Victoria's eldest son and heir, <a href="Edward%20VII">Albert Edward</a>, was approaching his twenty-first birthday. Edward's dissipated lifestyle had been disappointing to his parents, and his father, <a href="Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort">Prince Albert</a>, thought that marriage and the purchase of a suitable establishment were necessary to ground the Prince in country life and pursuits and lessen the influence of the <a href="Royal%20baccarat%20scandal">"Marlborough House set"</a> with which he was involved. Albert had his staff investigate eighteen possible country estates that might be suitable, including <a href="Newstead%20Abbey">Newstead Abbey</a> in Nottinghamshire and <a href="Houghton%20Hall">Houghton Hall</a> in Norfolk. The need to act quickly was reinforced by the <a href="Nellie%20Clifden">Nellie Clifden</a> affair, when Edward's fellow officers smuggled the actress into his quarters. The possibility of a scandal was deeply concerning to his parents. Sandringham Hall was on the list of the estates considered, and a personal recommendation to the Prince Consort from the <a href="Prime%20Minister">Prime Minister</a> Lord Palmerston, stepfather to the owner, swayed Prince Albert. Negotiations were only slightly delayed by Albert's death in December 1861—his widow declared, "His wishes – his plans – about everything are to be my law". The Prince visited in February 1862, and a sale was agreed for the house and just under 8,000 acres of land, which was finalised that October. Queen Victoria only twice visited the house she had paid for. Over the course of the next forty years, and with considerable expenditure, Edward was to create a house and country estate that his friend <a href="Charles%20Wynn-Carington%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Lincolnshire">Charles Carington</a> called "the most comfortable in England".

The price paid for Sandringham, £220,000, has been described as "exorbitant". This is questioned by Helen Walch, author of the estate's recent (2012) history, who shows the detailed analysis undertaken by the Prince Consort's advisers and suggests that the cost was reasonable. The house was soon found to be too small to accommodate the Prince of Wales's establishment following his marriage in March 1863 and the many guests he was required, and desired, to entertain. In 1865, two years after moving in, the Prince commissioned <a href="A.%20J.%20Humbert">A. J. Humbert</a> to raze the original hall and create a much larger building. Humbert was an architect favoured by the royal family—"for no good reason", according to the architectural historian <a href="Mark%20Girouard">Mark Girouard</a>—and had previously undertaken work for Queen Victoria at <a href="Osborne%20House">Osborne House</a> and at <a href="Frogmore%20House">Frogmore House</a>. The new red-brick house was complete by late 1870; the only element of the original house of the Henley Hostes and the Cowpers that was retained was the elaborate conservatory designed by Teulon in the 1830s. Edward had this room converted into a billiard room. A plaque in the entrance hall records that "This house was built by Albert Edward Prince of Wales and <a href="Alexandra%20of%20Denmark">Alexandra</a> his wife in the year of our Lord 1870". The building was entered through a large <a href="porte-coch%C3%A8re">porte-cochère</a> straight into the main living room (the saloon), an arrangement that was subsequently found to be inconvenient. The house provided living and sleeping accommodation over three storeys, with attics and a basement. The Norfolk countryside surrounding the house appealed to Alexandra, as it reminded her of her native Denmark.
Within a decade, the house was again found to be too small, and in 1883 a new extension, the Bachelors' Wing, was constructed to the designs of a Norfolk architect, <a href="Robert%20William%20Edis">Colonel R. W. Edis</a>. Edis also built a new billiard room and converted the old conservatory into a bowling alley. The Prince of Wales had been impressed by one he had seen at <a href="Trentham%20Estate">Trentham Hall,</a> and the alley at Sandringham was modelled on an example from <a href="Offenbach%20am%20Main">Rumpelheim</a>, Germany. In 1891, during preparations for the Prince of Wales's fiftieth birthday, a serious fire broke out when maids lit all the fires in the second-floor bedrooms to warm them in advance of the Prince's arrival. Edis was recalled to undertake rebuilding and further construction. As he had with the Bachelors' Wing, Edis tried to harmonise these additions with Humbert's house by following the original <a href="Jacobethan">Jacobethan</a> style, and by using matching brickwork and <a href="Ketton%20stone">Ketton stone</a>.

The house was up to date in its facilities, the modern kitchens and lighting running on gas from the estate's own plant and water being supplied from the <a href="Appleton%20Water%20Tower">Appleton Water Tower</a>, constructed at the highest <a href="Flitcham%20with%20Appleton">point</a> on the estate. The tower was designed in an <a href="Italianate%20architecture">Italianate</a> style by Robert Rawlinson, and Alexandra laid the foundation stone in 1877. The Prince's efforts as a country gentleman were approved by the press of the day; a contemporary newspaper expressed a wish to ""Sandringhamize" Marlborough House – as a landlord, agriculturist and country gentleman, the Prince sets an example which might be followed with advantage".

The royal couple's developments at Sandringham were not confined to the house; over the course of their occupation, the wider estate was also transformed. Ornamental and kitchen gardens were established, employing over 100 gardeners at their peak. Many estate buildings were constructed, including cottages for staff, kennels, a school, a rectory and a staff clubhouse, the Babingley. Edward also made Sandringham one of the best sporting estates in England to provide a setting for the elaborate weekend shooting parties that became Sandringham's defining rationale. To increase the amount of daylight available during the shooting season, which ran from October to February, the Prince introduced the tradition of <a href="Sandringham%20Time">Sandringham Time</a>, whereby all the clocks on the estate were set half an hour ahead of <a href="Greenwich%20Mean%20Time">GMT</a>. This tradition was maintained until 1936. Edward's entertaining was legendary, and the scale of the slaughter of <a href="Game%20%28hunting%29">game birds</a>, predominantly pheasants and partridges, was colossal. The meticulously maintained game books recorded annual bags of between 6,000 and 8,000 birds in the 1870s, rising to bags of over 20,000 a year by 1900. The game larder, constructed for the storage of the carcasses, was inspired by that at <a href="Holkham%20Hall">Holkham Hall</a> and was the largest in Europe.

Guests for Sandringham house parties generally arrived at <a href="Wolferton%20railway%20station">Wolferton railway station</a>, 2.5 miles from the house, travelling in royal trains that ran from <a href="St%20Pancras%20Station">St Pancras Station</a> to <a href="King%27s%20Lynn">King's Lynn</a> and then on to Wolferton. The station served the house from 1862 until its closure in 1969. Thereafter, the Queen travelled by car from King's Lynn. Edward VII established the Sandringham <a href="stud%20farm">stud</a> in 1897, achieving considerable success with the racehorses <a href="Persimmon%20%28horse%29">Persimmon</a> and <a href="Diamond%20Jubilee%20%28horse%29">Diamond Jubilee</a>. Neither his son nor his grandsons evinced as much interest in horses, although the stud was maintained; but his great-granddaughter, Elizabeth II, has sought to match Edward's equestrian achievements and has bred several winners at the Sandringham Stud.

On 14 January 1892, Edward's eldest son and heir, <a href="Prince%20Albert%20Victor%2C%20Duke%20of%20Clarence%20and%20Avondale">Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale</a>, died of pneumonia at the house. He is commemorated in the clock tower, which bears an inscription in Latin that translates as "the hours perish and will be charged to our account". Edward fell ill at Sandringham in early 1910 and died at <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> on 6 May.

In his will Edward VII left his widow £200,000 and a lifetime interest in the Sandringham estate. Queen Alexandra's continued occupancy of the "big house" compelled George V, his wife, Queen Mary, and their expanding family to remain at York Cottage in the grounds, in rather "cramped" conditions. Suggestions from courtiers that Queen Alexandra might move out were firmly rebuffed by the King; "It is my mother's house, my father built it for her". The King also lacked the sociability of his father, and the shortage of space at York Cottage enabled him to limit the entertaining he undertook, with the small rooms reportedly reminding him of the onboard cabins of his naval career.
The new King's primary interests, aside from his constitutional duties, were shooting and stamp collecting. He was considered one of the best shots in England, and his collections of shotguns and stamps were among the finest in the world. Deeply conservative by nature, George sought to maintain the traditions of Sandringham estate life established by his father, and life at York Cottage provided respite from the constitutional and political struggles that overshadowed the early years of George's reign. Even greater upheaval was occasioned by the outbreak of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, a dynastic struggle that involved many of his relatives, including the <a href="Wilhelm%20II%2C%20German%20Emperor">German Kaiser</a> and the <a href="Nicholas%20II%20of%20Russia">Russian Emperor</a>, both of whom had previously been guests at Sandringham. The estate and village of Sandringham suffered a major loss when all but two members of the King's Own Sandringham Company, a <a href="Territorial%20Force">territorial</a> unit of the Fifth Battalion of the <a href="Royal%20Norfolk%20Regiment">Royal Norfolk Regiment</a>, were killed at <a href="Landing%20at%20Suvla%20Bay">Sulva Bay</a> during the <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli Campaign</a>. The story of the battalion was the subject of a <a href="BBC">BBC</a> drama, "<a href="All%20the%20King%27s%20Men%20%281999%20film%29">All the King's Men</a>". A memorial to the dead was raised on the estate; the names of those killed in the Second World War were added subsequently.

Following Queen Alexandra's death at Sandringham on 20 November 1925, the King and his family moved to the main house. In 1932, George V gave the first of the <a href="Royal%20Christmas%20Message">royal Christmas messages</a> from a studio erected at Sandringham. The speech, written by <a href="Rudyard%20Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>, began, "I speak now from my home and from my heart to you all". George V died in his bedroom at Sandringham at 11.55 p.m. on 20 January 1936, his death hastened by injections of morphine and cocaine, to maintain the King's dignity and to enable the announcement of his death to be made in the following day's "<a href="The%20Times">Times</a>". The King's body was moved to <a href="St.%20Mary%20Magdalene%20Church%2C%20Sandringham">St Mary Magdalene's Church</a>, a scene described by the late King's assistant private secretary, <a href="Alan%20Lascelles">"Tommy" Lascelles</a>. "Next evening we took him over to the little church at the end of the garden. We saw the lych-gate brilliantly lit (and) the guardsmen slung the coffin on their shoulders and laid it before the altar. After a brief service, we left it, to be watched over by the men of the Sandringham Estate." Two days later, George's body was transported by train from Wolferton to London, and to its lying in state at Westminster Hall.

On the night of his father's death, Edward VIII summarily ordered that the clocks at Sandringham be returned to <a href="Greenwich%20Mean%20Time">Greenwich Mean Time</a>, ending the tradition of Sandringham Time begun by his grandfather over 50 years earlier. Edward had rarely enjoyed his visits to Sandringham, either in his father's time or that of his grandfather. He described a typical dinner at the house in a letter to his then mistress <a href="Freda%20Dudley%20Ward">Freda Dudley Ward</a>, dated 26 December 1919; "it's too dull and boring for words. Christ how any human beings can ever have got themselves into this pompous secluded and monotonous groove I just can't imagine". In another letter, evenings at the "big house" – Edward stayed at York Cottage with his father – were recorded as "sordidly dull and boring". His antipathy to the house was unlikely to have been lessened by his late father's will, which was read to the family in the saloon at the house. His brothers were each left £750,000 while Edward was bequeathed no monetary assets beyond the revenues from the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Cornwall">Duchy of Cornwall</a>. A codicil also prevented him from selling the late King's personal possessions; Lascelles described the inheritance as "the Kingship without the cash".

Edward's concerns regarding his income led him immediately to focus on the expense associated with running his late father's private homes. Sandringham he described as a "voracious <a href="white%20elephant">white elephant</a>", and he asked his brother George to undertake a review of the management of the estate, which had been costing his father £50,000 annually in subsidies at the time of his death. The review recommended significant retrenchments, and its partial implementation caused considerable resentment among the dismissed staff. Edward spent a single night of his reign at the house, bringing <a href="Wallis%20Simpson">Wallis Simpson</a> for a shooting party in October 1936. The party was interrupted by a request to meet with prime minister <a href="Stanley%20Baldwin">Stanley Baldwin</a>, and having arrived on a Sunday, the King returned to <a href="Fort%20Belvedere%2C%20Surrey">Fort Belvedere</a> the next day. He never returned to Sandringham; and, his attention diverted by the <a href="Edward%20VIII%20abdication%20crisis">impending crisis</a> arising from his attachment to Simpson, within two months of his only visit to the house as King, he had abdicated. On his abdication, as Sandringham and <a href="Balmoral%20Castle">Balmoral Castle</a> were the private property of the monarch, it was necessary for King George VI to purchase both properties. The price paid, £300,000, was a cause of friction between the new King and his brother.

George VI had been born at Sandringham on 14 December 1895. A keen follower of country pursuits, he was as devoted to the estate as his father, writing to his mother, Queen Mary, "I have always been so happy here". The deep retrenchment planned by his brother was not enacted, but economies were still made. His mother was at church at Sandringham on Sunday 3 September 1939, when the outbreak of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> was declared. The house was shut up during the war, but occasional visits were made to the estate, with the family staying at outlying cottages. After the war the King made improvements to the gardens surrounding the house; but, as traditionalist as his father, he made few other changes. December 1945 saw the first celebration of Christmas at the house since 1938. Lady Airlie recorded her impressions at dinner: "I sat next to the King. His face was tired and strained and he ate practically nothing. Looking at him I felt the cold fear of the probability of another short reign".

George was a heavy smoker throughout his life and had an operation to remove part of his lung in September 1951. He was never fully well again and died at Sandringham during the early morning of 6 February 1952. He had gone out after hares on 5 February, "shooting conspicuously well", and had planned the next day's shoot before retiring at 10.30 p.m. He was discovered at 7.30 a.m. in his bedroom by his valet, having died of a <a href="coronary%20thrombosis">coronary thrombosis</a> at the age of 56. His body was placed in the <a href="St.%20Mary%20Magdalene%20Church%2C%20Sandringham">Church of St Mary Magdalene</a>, before being taken to Wolferton Station and transported by train to London, to lie in state at Westminster Hall.

Since King George VI's death, Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a>'s custom has been to spend the anniversary of that and of her own <a href="Proclamation%20of%20accession%20of%20Elizabeth%20II%23United%20Kingdom">accession</a> privately with her family at Sandringham House, and, more recently, to use it as her official base from <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a> until February. In celebrating Christmas at Sandringham, the Queen follows the tradition of her last three predecessors, whereas her great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, held her celebrations at <a href="Windsor%20Castle">Windsor Castle</a>. The taxation arrangements of the monarch meant that no <a href="Inheritance%20Tax%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">inheritance tax</a> was paid on the Sandringham or Balmoral estates when they passed to the Queen, at a time when it was having a deleterious effect on other country estates. On her accession, the Queen asked her husband, the <a href="Duke%20of%20Edinburgh">Duke of Edinburgh</a>, to take on the responsibility for the management of the estate. The Duke has worked to move towards self-sufficiency, generating additional income streams, taking more of the land in hand, and amalgamating many of the smaller tenant farms.

In January 1957 the Queen received the resignation of the Prime Minister <a href="Anthony%20Eden">Anthony Eden</a> at the house. Eden's wife, <a href="Clarissa%20Eden">Clarissa</a>, recorded the event in her diary, "8 January – Anthony has to go through a Cabinet and listening to <a href="Harold%20Macmillan">Harold</a> prosing for half an hour. Then by train to Sandringham. Many photographers. We arrive into the hall where everyone is looking at the television." At the end of that year, the Queen made her first televised Christmas broadcast from Sandringham. In the 1960s, plans were initiated to demolish the house and replace it with a modern residence by <a href="David%20Roberts%20%28architect%29">David Roberts</a>, an architect who worked mainly at the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>. The plans were not taken forward, but modernisation of the interior of the house and the removal of a range of ancillary buildings were carried out by <a href="Hugh%20Casson">Hugh Casson</a>, who also decorated the <a href="HMY%20Britannia">Royal Yacht, "Britannia"</a>. In 1977, for her silver jubilee, the Queen opened the house to the public.

Sandringham continues to operate as a sporting estate. The pheasants and partridge are no longer reared for this purpose, and Sandringham is now one of the few wild shoots in England. Along with her equestrian interest in the Sandringham Stud, where she has bred several winning horses, the Queen has developed a successful <a href="gun%20dog">gun dog</a> breeding programme at Sandringham. Following the tradition of a kennels at Sandringham established by her great grandfather, when Queen Alexandra kept over 100 dogs on the estate, the Queen prefers black <a href="labrador%20retrievers">labrador retrievers</a>, over the yellow type favoured by her father, and the terriers bred by her earlier predecessors. Since his retirement from official duties in August 2017, the Duke of Edinburgh has spent increasing amounts of time at <a href="Wood%20Farm">Wood Farm</a>, a cottage on the Sandringham Estate used by the Duke and the Queen when not hosting guests at the main house. Sandringham is one of the two homes owned by the Queen in her private capacity, rather than as <a href="head%20of%20state">head of state</a>, the other being <a href="Balmoral%20Castle">Balmoral Castle</a>.

The house is mainly constructed of red brick with <a href="limestone">limestone</a> <a href="Ashlar">dressings</a>; <a href="Carrstone">Norfolk Carrstone</a> is also prevalent, particularly in Eddis's additions. The tiled roof contains nine separate clusters of chimneystacks. The style is <a href="Jacobethan">Jacobethan</a>, with inspiration drawn principally from nearby <a href="Blickling%20Hall">Blickling Hall</a>. Construction was undertaken by Goggs Brothers of <a href="Swaffham">Swaffham</a>. The principal rooms of the house are the saloon, the drawing room, the dining room and the ballroom, together with rooms devoted to sports, such as the gun room, or leisure, such as the bowling alley, now a library, and the billiard room. The walls of the corridors connecting the principal rooms display a collection of <a href="Orient">Orient</a>al and Indian arms and armour, gathered by Edward VII on his tour of the East in 1875–1876. Decoration of the house and the provision of furniture and fittings was undertaken by <a href="Holland%20and%20Sons">Holland and Sons</a> in the 1870 rebuilding.

The largest room in the house, the saloon is used as the main reception room. The arrangement of entry under the <a href="porte-coch%C3%A8re">porte-cochère</a> direct into the saloon proved problematic, with no ante-room in which guests could remove their hats and coats. Jenkins describes the decorative style, here and elsewhere in the house, as "<a href="Osbert%20Lancaster">Osbert Lancaster</a>'s <a href="Curzon%20Street">Curzon Street</a> <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a>". The room contains portraits of <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> and <a href="Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort">Prince Albert</a> by their favourite artist <a href="Franz%20Xaver%20Winterhalter">Franz Xaver Winterhalter</a>. The saloon functioned as a venue for dances, until the construction of the new ballroom by Edis, and has a <a href="minstrels%27%20gallery">minstrels' gallery</a> to accommodate musicians. The room contains a weighing machine; Edward VII was in the habit of requiring his guests to be weighed on their arrival, and again on their departure, to establish that his lavish hospitality had caused them to put on weight.

The drawing room is described by Jenkins as "the nearest Sandringham gets to pomp". On one of her two visits to the house, Victoria recorded in her journal that, after dinner, the party adjourned to, "the very long and handsome drawing room with painted ceiling and two fireplaces". The room contains portraits of Queen Alexandra and her daughters, <a href="Louise%2C%20Princess%20Royal">Princess Louise</a>, <a href="Princess%20Victoria%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Princess Victoria</a>, and <a href="Princess%20Maud%20of%20Wales">Princess Maud of Wales</a>, by <a href="Edward%20Hughes%20%28artist%29">Edward Hughes</a>. White marble statues complete what has been described as a "tour de force of fashionable late-Victorian decoration".

The ballroom was added by Edis in 1884, to overcome the inconvenience of having only the saloon as the major room for entertaining. As this was also the main family living room, it had previously been necessary to remove the furniture when the saloon was required for dances and large entertainments. Alexandra recorded her delight at the result, "Our new ballroom is beautiful I think & a great success & avoids pulling the hall to pieces each time there is a ball or anything". At the time of Queen Victoria's visit in 1889, the room was used for a theatrical performance given by <a href="Henry%20Irving">Sir Henry Irving</a> and <a href="Ellen%20Terry">Ellen Terry</a>. The present Queen uses the room for entertainments and as a cinema.

The walls of the dining room are decorated with Spanish tapestries including some by <a href="Goya">Goya</a> which were a gift from <a href="Alfonso%20XII%20of%20Spain">Alfonso XII of Spain</a>. The walls are panelled in oak, painted light green for <a href="Mary%20of%20Teck">Queen Mary</a> who had been inspired by a visit to a Scottish castle. Jill Franklin's study of the planning of Victorian country houses includes a photograph of the dining room at Sandringham with the table laid for dinner for twenty-four, a "very usual" number to seat for dinner in a major country house of the time.

Sandringham House has not been admired by critics. Its chief fault is the lack of harmony between Humbert's original building and Edis's extensions, "a contrast between the northern and southern halves of the house (that) has been much criticised ever since". The architectural historian <a href="John%20Martin%20Robinson">John Martin Robinson</a> wrote in 1982, "Sandringham, the latest in date of the houses of the British monarchy, is the least distinguished architecturally". In his biography of Queen Mary, <a href="James%20Pope-Hennessy">James Pope-Hennessy</a> compared the house unfavourably to "a golf-hotel at St Andrews or a station-hotel at Strathpeffer". <a href="Simon%20Jenkins">Simon Jenkins</a> considered Sandringham "unattractive", with a "grim, institutional appearance". Pevsner described the architectural style as "frenetic"; Girouard expressed himself perplexed as to the preference shown by the royal family for A. J. Humbert, a patronage the writer Adrian Tinniswood described as "the Victorian Royal Family's knack for choosing second-rate architects". An article on the house in the June 1902 edition of "<a href="Country%20Life%20%28magazine%29">Country Life</a>" opined, "of mere splendour there is not much, but of substantial comfort a good deal". The writer <a href="Clive%20Aslet">Clive Aslet</a> suggests that the sporting opportunities offered by the estate were the main attraction for its royal owners, rather than "the house itself, which even after rebuilding was never beguiling".

The fittings and furnishings were also criticised; the biographer of George V, <a href="Kenneth%20Rose">Kenneth Rose</a>, wrote that, "except for some tapestries given by Alfonso XII, Sandringham had not a single good picture, piece of furniture or other work of art". Neither Edward VII nor his heir, were noted for their artistic appreciation; writing of the redevelopments at Buckingham Palace undertaken by George V, and previously by Edward VII, the architectural historian John Martin Robinson wrote that, "the King had no more aesthetic sensibility than his father and expressed impatience with his wife's keen interest in furniture and decoration". In the series of articles on the house and estate published in 1902 by "Country Life" to celebrate Edward VII's accession, the author noted the royal family's "set policy of preferring those pictures that have "associations" to those which have merely artistic merit". Exceptions came to include works from the collection of mainly 20th-century English art assembled by the Queen Mother, including pieces by <a href="Edward%20Seago">Edward Seago</a> and <a href="John%20Piper%20%28artist%29">John Piper</a>, who produced a view of Sandringham.

Although not highly regarded as architecture, Sandringham is a rare extant example of a full-scale Victorian country house, described in the magazine "Country Life" as "lived in and beautifully maintained, complete with its original contents, gardens and dependent estate buildings". The house, the landscaped gardens, park and woodlands are listed <a href="listed%20building">Grade II*</a> on the <a href="Register%20of%20Historic%20Parks%20and%20Gardens%20of%20special%20historic%20interest%20in%20England">Register of Historic Parks and Gardens</a>, Grade II* being the second-highest listing, reserved for "particularly important buildings of more than special interest".

The gardens and country park comprise of the estate with the gardens extending to . They were predominantly laid out from the 1860s, with later alterations and simplifications. Edward VII sought advice from William Broderick Thomas and <a href="Ferdinand%20de%20Rothschild">Ferdinand de Rothschild</a>, a friend and adviser to the King throughout his life. The original lake was filled and replaced with the elaborate <a href="parterres">parterres</a> fashionable at the time. These have since been removed. Two new lakes were dug further from the house, and bordered by <a href="Rock%20garden">rockeries</a> constructed of <a href="Pulhamite">Pulhamite</a> stone. A summerhouse, called "The Nest", stands above the Upper Lake, a gift in 1913 to Queen Alexandra from the <a href="comptroller">comptroller</a> of her household, <a href="Dighton%20Probyn">General Sir Dighton Probyn</a>. The gardens to the north of the house, which are overlooked by the suite of rooms used by George VI, were remodelled and simplified by <a href="Geoffrey%20Jellicoe">Geoffrey Jellicoe</a> for the King and his wife after the Second World War. A statue of <a href="Father%20Time">Father Time</a>, dating from the 18th century, was purchased by the Queen Mother and installed in 1951. Further areas of the gardens were remodelled by <a href="Eric%20Savill">Sir Eric Savill</a> in the 1960s for Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip. The extensive kitchen gardens, which in Edward VII's time included carriage drives to allow guests to view the "highly ornamental" arrangements, were also laid to lawn during the present Queen's reign, having proved uneconomic to maintain.

The 20,000 acre Sandringham estate has some of the finest <a href="Hunting%20and%20shooting%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom%23Shooting">shoots</a> in England, and is used for royal shooting parties. Covering seven villages, the estate's other main activities, aside from tourism, are arable crops and forestry. The grounds provided room for Queen Alexandra's menagerie of horses, dogs, cats, and other animals. In 1886 a racing pigeon loft was constructed for birds given to the Duke of York by <a href="Leopold%20II%20of%20Belgium">King Leopold II of Belgium</a> and one or more lofts for pigeons have been maintained ever since. The Norwich Gates, designed by Thomas Jeckell and made by the local firm of Barnard, Bishop and Barnard, were a wedding present for Edward and Alexandra from "the gentry of Norfolk".

In 2007 Sandringham House and its grounds were designated a protected site under Section 128 of the <a href="Serious%20Organised%20Crime%20and%20Police%20Act%202005">Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005</a>. This makes it a criminal offence to <a href="Trespass%20in%20English%20law">trespass</a> in the house or its grounds. The Sandringham estate has a museum in the former coach house with displays of royal life and estate history. The museum also houses an extensive collection of royal motor vehicles including a 1900 <a href="Daimler%20Company">Daimler</a> owned by Edward VII and a 1939 <a href="Merryweather%20%26amp%3B%20Sons">Merryweather & Sons</a> fire engine, made for the Sandringham fire brigade which was founded in 1865 and operated independently on the estate until 1968. The coach house stables and garaging were designed by A. J .Humbert at the same time as his construction of the main house. The estate contains several houses with close links to the royal family.

<a href="Anmer%20Hall">Anmer Hall</a> is a <a href="Georgian%20era">Georgian</a> house on the grounds, purchased by the Prince of Wales in 1896. Formerly occupied by the <a href="Prince%20Edward%2C%20Duke%20of%20Kent">Duke of Kent</a>, it is now the country home of the <a href="William%2C%20Duke%20of%20Cambridge">Duke</a> and <a href="Kate%20Middleton">Duchess of Cambridge</a>.

When Prince Carl of Denmark (later <a href="King%20Haakon%20VII%20of%20Norway">King Haakon VII of Norway</a>) and <a href="Maud%20of%20Wales">Princess Maud</a> were married in July 1896, Appleton House was a wedding gift to them from the bride's parents, the Prince and Princess of Wales. Queen Maud became fond of Appleton, "our little house is a perfect paradise", and their son, the future <a href="Olav%20V%20of%20Norway">King Olav V of Norway</a>, was born at the house in 1903. The last inhabitants were King George VI and <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20The%20Queen%20Mother">Queen Elizabeth</a> who stayed there during a visit to Norfolk during World War II, when Sandringham was closed. Lascelles considered it "an ugly villa, but not uncomfortable". The house was demolished in 1984.

Constructed by Edward VII, Park House has been owned by the royal family for many years. The birthplace of <a href="Diana%2C%20Princess%20of%20Wales">Diana, Princess of Wales</a> when the house was let to her <a href="John%20Spencer%2C%208th%20Earl%20Spencer">father</a>, it is now a hotel managed by the <a href="Leonard%20Cheshire%20Disability">Leonard Cheshire charity</a>.

<a href="Wood%20Farm">Wood Farm</a> has been part of the Sandringham Estate since the time of Edward VII. In the early 20th century, it was home to <a href="Prince%20John%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prince John</a>, the youngest of George V and Queen Mary's six children. Born in 1905, the Prince was epileptic, and spent much of his life in relative seclusion at Sandringham. He died at Wood Farm, his home for the last two years of his life, on 18 January 1919.

<a href="York%20Cottage">York Cottage</a>, originally known as Bachelors' Cottage, was built by Edward, Prince of Wales, soon after he acquired Sandringham to provide further accommodation for guests. It was home to <a href="George%20V">George V</a> from 1893 until his mother's death enabled him to move into the main house in 1925. When discussing his father with Harold Nicolson, at the time Nicolson had been appointed to write the late King's biography, Edward VIII, by then Duke of Windsor, remarked "Until you have seen York Cottage you will never understand my father". The cottage was no more highly regarded architecturally than the main house; <a href="James%20Pope-Hennessy">James Pope-Hennessy</a>, the official biographer of Queen Mary, called it, "tremendously vulgar and emphatically, almost defiantly hideous". Nicolson described it as a "glum little villa (with) rooms indistinguishable from those of any <a href="Surbiton">Surbiton</a> or <a href="Upper%20Norwood">Upper Norwood</a> home". He was particularly dismissive of the royal bathing arrangements: "Oh my God! what a place. The King's and Queen's baths had lids that shut down so that when not in use they could be used as tables". "It is almost incredible that the heir to so vast a heritage lived in this horrible little house." Nicolson's strictures did not appear in his official biography of the King. York Cottage is currently the estate office for the Sandringham Estate.

The country park and the visitors' centre are open throughout the year. The house, gardens and museum open annually from the end of March until the end of October, except for 23–25 July.

Guy Fawkes Night

Guy Fawkes Night, also known as Guy Fawkes Day, Bonfire Night and Firework Night, is an annual commemoration observed on 5 November, primarily in the United Kingdom. Its history begins with the events of 5 November 1605 <a href="Julian%20calendar">O.S.</a>, when <a href="Guy%20Fawkes">Guy Fawkes</a>, a member of the <a href="Gunpowder%20Plot">Gunpowder Plot</a>, was arrested while guarding <a href="explosives">explosives</a> the plotters had placed beneath the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>. Celebrating the fact that <a href="James%20VI%20and%20I">King James I</a> had survived the attempt on his life, people lit <a href="bonfire">bonfire</a>s around London; and months later, the introduction of the <a href="Observance%20of%205th%20November%20Act%201605">Observance of 5th November Act</a> enforced an annual public day of thanksgiving for the plot's failure.

Within a few decades Gunpowder Treason Day, as it was known, became the predominant English state commemoration, but as it carried strong Protestant religious overtones it also became a focus for <a href="Anti-Catholicism%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">anti-Catholic sentiment</a>. <a href="Puritans">Puritans</a> delivered sermons regarding the perceived dangers of <a href="popery">popery</a>, while during increasingly raucous celebrations common folk burnt <a href="effigy">effigies</a> of popular hate-figures, such as the <a href="pope">pope</a>. Towards the end of the 18th century reports appear of children begging for money with effigies of Guy Fawkes and 5 November gradually became known as Guy Fawkes Day. Towns such as <a href="Lewes">Lewes</a> and <a href="Guildford">Guildford</a> were in the 19th century scenes of increasingly violent class-based confrontations, fostering traditions those towns celebrate still, albeit peaceably. In the 1850s changing attitudes resulted in the toning down of much of the day's anti-Catholic rhetoric, and the Observance of 5th November Act was repealed in 1859. Eventually the violence was dealt with, and by the 20th century Guy Fawkes Day had become an enjoyable social commemoration, although lacking much of its original focus. The present-day Guy Fawkes Night is usually celebrated at large organised events, centred on a bonfire and extravagant <a href="firework">firework</a> displays.

Settlers exported Guy Fawkes Night to overseas colonies, including some in North America, where it was known as <a href="Pope%20Day">Pope Day</a>. Those festivities died out with the onset of the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a>. Claims that Guy Fawkes Night was a Protestant replacement for older customs like <a href="Samhain">Samhain</a> are disputed, although another old celebration, <a href="Halloween">Halloween</a>, has lately increased in popularity in England, and according to some writers, may threaten the continued observance of 5 November.

Guy Fawkes Night originates from the <a href="Gunpowder%20Plot">Gunpowder Plot</a> of 1605, a failed conspiracy by a group of provincial English <a href="Catholics">Catholics</a> to assassinate the <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> King <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">James I of England</a> and replace him with a Catholic head of state. In the immediate aftermath of the 5 November arrest of <a href="Guy%20Fawkes">Guy Fawkes</a>, caught guarding a cache of explosives placed beneath the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>, James's Council allowed the public to celebrate the king's survival with <a href="bonfire">bonfire</a>s, so long as they were "without any danger or disorder". This made 1605 the first year the plot's failure was celebrated. The following January, days before the surviving conspirators were executed, Parliament passed the <a href="Observance%20of%205th%20November%20Act%201605">Observance of 5th November Act</a>, commonly known as the "Thanksgiving Act". It was proposed by a Puritan Member of Parliament, <a href="Edward%20Montagu%2C%201st%20Baron%20Montagu%20of%20Boughton">Edward Montagu</a>, who suggested that the king's apparent deliverance by divine intervention deserved some measure of official recognition, and kept 5 November free as a day of thanksgiving while in theory making attendance at Church mandatory. A new form of service was also added to the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>'s "<a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>", for use on that date.

Little is known about the earliest celebrations. In settlements such as <a href="Carlisle%2C%20Cumbria">Carlisle</a>, <a href="Norwich">Norwich</a>, and <a href="Nottingham">Nottingham</a>, corporations (town governments) provided music and artillery salutes. <a href="Canterbury">Canterbury</a> celebrated 5 November 1607 with of gunpowder and of <a href="slow%20match">match</a>, and three years later food and drink was provided for local dignitaries, as well as music, explosions, and a parade by the local militia. Even less is known of how the occasion was first commemorated by the general public, although records indicate that in the Protestant stronghold of <a href="Dorchester%2C%20Dorset">Dorchester</a> a sermon was read, the church bells rung, and bonfires and fireworks lit.

According to historian and author <a href="Antonia%20Fraser">Antonia Fraser</a>, a study of the earliest sermons preached demonstrates an anti-Catholic concentration "mystical in its fervour". Delivering one of five 5 November sermons printed in "A Mappe of Rome" in 1612, <a href="Thomas%20Taylor%20%28priest%2C%201576%E2%80%931633%29">Thomas Taylor</a> spoke of the "generality of his [a papist's] cruelty", which had been "almost without bounds". Such messages were also spread in printed works like Francis Herring's "Pietas Pontifica" (republished in 1610 as "Popish Piety"), and John Rhode's "A Brief Summe of the Treason intended against the King & State", which in 1606 sought to educate "the simple and ignorant ... that they be not seduced any longer by papists". By the 1620s the Fifth was honoured in market towns and villages across the country, though it was some years before it was commemorated throughout England. Gunpowder Treason Day, as it was then known, became the predominant English state commemoration. Some parishes made the day a festive occasion, with public drinking and solemn processions. Concerned though about James's pro-Spanish foreign policy, the decline of international Protestantism, and Catholicism in general, Protestant clergymen who recognised the day's significance called for more dignified and profound thanksgivings each 5 November.

What unity English Protestants had shared in the plot's immediate aftermath began to fade when in 1625 James's son, the future <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a>, married the Catholic <a href="Henrietta%20Maria%20of%20France">Henrietta Maria of France</a>. Puritans reacted to the marriage by issuing a new prayer to warn against rebellion and Catholicism, and on 5 November that year, effigies of the pope and the devil were burnt, the earliest such report of this practice and the beginning of centuries of tradition. During Charles's reign Gunpowder Treason Day became increasingly partisan. Between 1629 and 1640 he ruled without Parliament, and he seemed to support <a href="Arminianism">Arminianism</a>, regarded by Puritans like <a href="Henry%20Burton%20%28Puritan%29">Henry Burton</a> as a step toward Catholicism. By 1636, under the leadership of the Arminian Archbishop of Canterbury <a href="William%20Laud">William Laud</a>, the English church was trying to use 5 November to denounce all seditious practices, and not just popery. Puritans went on the defensive, some pressing for further <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">reformation</a> of the Church.
Bonfire Night, as it was occasionally known, assumed a new fervour during the events leading up to the <a href="English%20Interregnum">English Interregnum</a>. Although <a href="Cavalier">Royalists</a> disputed their interpretations, <a href="Roundheads">Parliamentarians</a> began to uncover or fear new Catholic plots. Preaching before the House of Commons on 5 November 1644, <a href="Charles%20Herle">Charles Herle</a> claimed that Papists were tunnelling "from Oxford, Rome, Hell, to Westminster, and there to blow up, if possible, the better foundations of your houses, their liberties and privileges". A display in 1647 at <a href="Lincoln%27s%20Inn%20Fields">Lincoln's Inn Fields</a> commemorated "God's great mercy in delivering this kingdom from the hellish plots of papists", and included fireballs burning in the water (symbolising a Catholic association with "<a href="Classification%20of%20demons">infernal spirits</a>") and fireboxes, their many rockets suggestive of "popish spirits coming from below" to enact plots against the king. Effigies of Fawkes and the pope were present, the latter represented by <a href="Pluto%20%28mythology%29">Pluto</a>, Roman god of the underworld.

Following Charles I's execution in 1649, the country's new republican regime remained undecided on how to treat 5 November. Unlike the old system of religious feasts and State anniversaries, it survived, but as a celebration of parliamentary government and Protestantism, and not of monarchy. Commonly the day was still marked by bonfires and miniature explosives, but formal celebrations resumed only with the <a href="Restoration%20%28England%29">Restoration</a>, when <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> became king. Courtiers, <a href="High%20Church">High Anglicans</a> and <a href="Tories">Tories</a> followed the official line, that the event marked God's preservation of the English throne, but generally the celebrations became more diverse. By 1670 <a href="London%20apprentices">London apprentices</a> had turned 5 November into a fire festival, attacking not only popery but also "sobriety and good order", demanding money from coach occupants for alcohol and bonfires. The burning of effigies, largely unknown to the <a href="Jacobean%20era">Jacobeans</a>, continued in 1673 when Charles's brother, the <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">Duke of York</a>, converted to Catholicism. In response, accompanied by a procession of about 1,000 people, the apprentices fired an effigy of the <a href="Whore%20of%20Babylon">Whore of Babylon</a>, bedecked with a range of papal symbols. Similar scenes occurred over the following few years. On 17 November 1677, anti-Catholic fervour saw the <a href="Accession%20Day">Accession Day</a> marked by the burning of a large effigy of the pope—his belly filled with live cats "who squalled most hideously as soon as they felt the fire"—and two effigies of devils "whispering in his ear". Two years later, as the <a href="Exclusion%20Bill">exclusion crisis</a> reached its zenith, an observer noted that "the 5th at night, being gunpowder treason, there were many bonfires and burning of popes as has ever been seen". Violent scenes in 1682 forced London's militia into action, and to prevent any repetition the following year a proclamation was issued, banning bonfires and fireworks.

Fireworks were also banned under <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James II</a>, who became king in 1685. Attempts by the government to tone down Gunpowder Treason Day celebrations were, however, largely unsuccessful, and some reacted to a ban on bonfires in London (born from a fear of more burnings of the pope's effigy) by placing candles in their windows, "as a witness against Catholicism". When James was deposed in 1688 by <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William of Orange</a>—who, importantly, landed in England on 5 November—the day's events turned also to the celebration of freedom and religion, with elements of anti-<a href="Jacobitism">Jacobitism</a>. While the earlier ban on bonfires was politically motivated, a ban on fireworks was maintained for safety reasons, "much mischief having been done by <a href="Squib%20%28explosive%29">squibs</a>".

William III's birthday fell on 4 November, and for orthodox <a href="Whig%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Whigs</a> the two days therefore became an important double anniversary. William ordered that the thanksgiving service for 5 November be amended to include thanks for his "happy arrival" and "the Deliverance of our Church and Nation". In the 1690s he re-established Protestant rule in Ireland, and the Fifth, occasionally marked by the ringing of church bells and civic dinners, was consequently eclipsed by his birthday commemorations. From the 19th century, 5 November celebrations there became sectarian in nature. Its celebration in Northern Ireland remains controversial, unlike in Scotland where bonfires continue to be lit in various cities. In England though, as one of 49 official holidays, for the ruling class 5 November became overshadowed by events such as the birthdays of <a href="Admiral">Admiral</a> <a href="Edward%20Vernon">Edward Vernon</a>, or <a href="John%20Wilkes">John Wilkes</a>, and under <a href="George%20II%20of%20England">George II</a> and <a href="George%20III%20of%20England">George III</a>, with the exception of the <a href="Jacobite%20Rising%20of%201745">Jacobite Rising of 1745</a>, it was largely "a polite entertainment rather than an occasion for vitriolic thanksgiving". For the lower classes, however, the anniversary was a chance to pit disorder against order, a pretext for violence and uncontrolled revelry. At some point, for reasons that are unclear, it became customary to burn Guy Fawkes in effigy, rather than the pope. Gradually, Gunpowder Treason Day became Guy Fawkes Day. In 1790 "The Times" reported instances of children "... begging for money for Guy Faux", and a report of 4 November 1802 described how "a set of idle fellows ... with some horrid figure dressed up as a "Guy Faux"" were convicted of begging and receiving money, and committed to prison as "idle and disorderly persons". The Fifth became "a polysemous occasion, replete with polyvalent cross-referencing, meaning all things to all men". Lower class rioting continued, with reports in <a href="Lewes">Lewes</a> of annual rioting, intimidation of "respectable householders" and the rolling through the streets of lit tar barrels. In <a href="Guildford">Guildford</a>, gangs of revellers who called themselves "guys" terrorised the local population; proceedings were concerned more with the settling of old arguments and general mayhem, than any historical reminiscences. Similar problems arose in <a href="Exeter">Exeter</a>, originally the scene of more traditional celebrations. In 1831 an effigy was burnt of the new Bishop of Exeter <a href="Henry%20Phillpotts">Henry Phillpotts</a>, a <a href="High%20Church">High Church</a> <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a> and <a href="High%20Tory">High Tory</a> who opposed <a href="Reform%20Act%201832">Parliamentary reform</a>, and who was also suspected of being involved in "creeping popery". A local ban on fireworks in 1843 was largely ignored, and attempts by the authorities to suppress the celebrations resulted in violent protests and several injured constables.
On several occasions during the 19th century "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" reported that the tradition was in decline, being "of late years almost forgotten", but in the opinion of historian David Cressy, such reports reflected "other Victorian trends", including a lessening of Protestant religious zeal—not general observance of the Fifth. Civil unrest brought about by the union of the Kingdoms of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a> in 1800 resulted in Parliament passing the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Relief%20Act%201829">Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829</a>, which afforded Catholics greater civil rights, continuing the process of <a href="Catholic%20Emancipation">Catholic Emancipation</a> in the two kingdoms. The traditional denunciations of Catholicism had been in decline since the early 18th century, and were thought by many, including <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>, to be outdated, but the pope's <a href="Universalis%20Ecclesiae">restoration in 1850</a> of the English Catholic hierarchy gave renewed significance to 5 November, as demonstrated by the burnings of effigies of the new Catholic Archbishop of Westminster <a href="Nicholas%20Wiseman">Nicholas Wiseman</a>, and the pope. At <a href="Farringdon%20Market">Farringdon Market</a> 14 effigies were processed from the <a href="Strand%2C%20London">Strand</a> and over <a href="Westminster%20Bridge">Westminster Bridge</a> to <a href="Southwark">Southwark</a>, while extensive demonstrations were held throughout the suburbs of London. Effigies of the 12 new English Catholic bishops were paraded through Exeter, already the scene of severe public disorder on each anniversary of the Fifth. Gradually, however, such scenes became less popular. With little resistance in Parliament, the thanksgiving prayer of 5 November contained in the Anglican "<a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>" was abolished, and in March 1859 the <a href="Anniversary%20Days%20Observance%20Act%201859">Anniversary Days Observance Act</a> repealed the Observance of 5th November Act. As the authorities dealt with the worst excesses, public decorum was gradually restored. The sale of fireworks was restricted, and the Guildford "guys" were neutralized in 1865, although this was too late for one constable, who died of his wounds. Violence continued in Exeter for some years, peaking in 1867 when, incensed by rising food prices and banned from firing their customary bonfire, a mob was twice in one night driven from <a href="St%20Martin%27s%20Church%2C%20Exeter">Cathedral Close</a> by armed infantry. Further riots occurred in 1879, but there were no more bonfires in Cathedral Close after 1894. Elsewhere, <a href="Mischief%20night">sporadic instances</a> of public disorder persisted late into the 20th century, accompanied by large numbers of firework-related accidents, but a national <a href="Firework%20Code">Firework Code</a> and improved public safety has in most cases brought an end to such things.

One notable aspect of the Victorians' commemoration of Guy Fawkes Night was its move away from the centres of communities, to their margins. Gathering wood for the bonfire increasingly became the province of working-class children, who solicited combustible materials, money, food and drink from wealthier neighbours, often with the aid of songs. Most opened with the familiar "Remember, remember, the fifth of November, Gunpowder Treason and Plot". The earliest recorded rhyme, from 1742, is reproduced below alongside one bearing similarities to most Guy Fawkes Night ditties, recorded in 1903 at <a href="Charlton%20on%20Otmoor">Charlton on Otmoor</a>:

Organised entertainments also became popular in the late 19th century, and 20th-century pyrotechnic manufacturers renamed Guy Fawkes Day as Firework Night. Sales of fireworks dwindled somewhat during the First World War, but resumed in the following peace. At the start of the Second World War celebrations were again suspended, resuming in November 1945. For many families, Guy Fawkes Night became a domestic celebration, and children often congregated on street corners, accompanied by their own effigy of Guy Fawkes. This was sometimes ornately dressed and sometimes a barely recognisable bundle of rags stuffed with whatever filling was suitable. A survey found that in 1981 about 23 percent of <a href="Sheffield">Sheffield</a> schoolchildren made Guys, sometimes weeks before the event. Collecting money was a popular reason for their creation, the children taking their effigy from door to door, or displaying it on street corners. But mainly, they were built to go on the bonfire, itself sometimes comprising wood stolen from other pyres; "an acceptable convention" that helped bolster another November tradition, <a href="Mischief%20Night">Mischief Night</a>. Rival gangs competed to see who could build the largest, sometimes even burning the wood collected by their opponents; in 1954 the "Yorkshire Post" reported on fires late in September, a situation that forced the authorities to remove latent piles of wood for safety reasons. Lately, however, the custom of begging for a "penny for the Guy" has almost completely disappeared. In contrast, some older customs still survive; in <a href="Ottery%20St%20Mary">Ottery St Mary</a> men chase each other through the streets with lit tar barrels, and since 1679 Lewes has been the setting of some of England's most extravagant 5 November celebrations, the <a href="Lewes%20Bonfire">Lewes Bonfire</a>.

Generally, modern 5 November celebrations are run by local charities and other organisations, with paid admission and controlled access. In 1998 an editorial in the "<a href="Catholic%20Herald">Catholic Herald</a>" called for the end of "Bonfire Night", labelling it "an offensive act". Author <a href="Martin%20Kettle">Martin Kettle</a>, writing in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" in 2003, bemoaned an "occasionally nannyish" attitude to fireworks that discourages people from holding firework displays in their back gardens, and an "unduly sensitive attitude" toward the anti-Catholic sentiment once so prominent on Guy Fawkes Night. David Cressy summarised the modern celebration with these words: "The rockets go higher and burn with more colour, but they have less and less to do with memories of the Fifth of November ... it might be observed that Guy Fawkes' Day is finally declining, having lost its connection with politics and religion. But we have heard that many times before."

Historians have often suggested that Guy Fawkes Day served as a Protestant replacement for the ancient <a href="Celts">Celtic</a> festival of <a href="Samhain">Samhain</a> or <a href="Calan%20Gaeaf">Calan Gaeaf</a>, <a href="Celtic%20polytheism">pagan</a> events that the church absorbed and transformed into <a href="All%20Hallow%27s%20Eve">All Hallow's Eve</a> and <a href="All%20Souls%27%20Day">All Souls' Day</a>. In "<a href="The%20Golden%20Bough">The Golden Bough</a>", the Scottish anthropologist <a href="James%20George%20Frazer">James George Frazer</a> suggested that Guy Fawkes Day exemplifies "the recrudescence of old customs in modern shapes". <a href="David%20Underdown">David Underdown</a>, writing in his 1987 work "Revel, Riot, and Rebellion", viewed Gunpowder Treason Day as a replacement for Hallowe'en: "just as the early church had taken over many of the pagan feasts, so did Protestants acquire their own rituals, adapting older forms or providing substitutes for them". While the use of bonfires to mark the occasion was most likely taken from the ancient practice of lighting celebratory bonfires, the idea that the commemoration of 5 November 1605 ever originated from anything other than the safety of James I is, according to David Cressy, "speculative nonsense". Citing Cressy's work, <a href="Ronald%20Hutton">Ronald Hutton</a> agrees with his conclusion, writing, "There is, in brief, nothing to link the Hallowe'en fires of North Wales, <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Man</a>, and central Scotland with those which appeared in England upon 5 November." Further confusion arises in <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, where some communities celebrate Guy Fawkes Night; the distinction there between the Fifth, and Halloween, is not always clear. Despite such disagreements, in 2005 <a href="David%20Cannadine">David Cannadine</a> commented on the encroachment into British culture of late 20th-century American Hallowe'en celebrations, and their effect on Guy Fawkes Night:

Reporting on the same topic, in 2012 the BBC's Tom de Castella concluded:

Another celebration involving fireworks, the five-day <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> festival of <a href="Diwali">Diwali</a> (normally observed between mid-October and November), in 2010 began on 5 November. This led "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" to comment on the similarities between the two, its reporter Kevin Rawlinson wondering "which fireworks will burn brightest".

Gunpowder Treason Day was exported by settlers to colonies around the world, including members of the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a> such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada and various Caribbean nations. The day is still marked in <a href="Saint%20Vincent%20and%20the%20Grenadines">Saint Vincent and the Grenadines</a>, and in <a href="Saint%20Kitts%20and%20Nevis">Saint Kitts and Nevis</a>, but a fireworks ban by <a href="Antigua%20and%20Barbuda">Antigua and Barbuda</a> during the 1990s reduced its popularity in that country. In Australia, <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> (founded as a <a href="penal%20colony">penal colony</a> in 1788) saw at least one instance of the parading and burning of a Guy Fawkes effigy in 1805, while in 1833, four years after its founding, <a href="Perth">Perth</a> listed Gunpowder Treason Day as a public holiday. By the 1970s, Guy Fawkes Night had become less common in Australia. Some measure of celebration remains in New Zealand, Canada and South Africa.

In North America the commemoration was at first paid scant attention, but the arrest of two boys caught lighting bonfires on 5 November 1662 in <a href="Boston">Boston</a> suggests, in historian James Sharpe's view, that "an underground tradition of commemorating the Fifth existed". In parts of North America it was known as Pope Day, celebrated mainly in colonial <a href="History%20of%20New%20England">New England</a>, but also as far south as <a href="History%20of%20Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston</a>. In Boston, founded in 1630 by Puritan settlers led by <a href="John%20Winthrop">John Winthrop</a>, an early celebration was held in 1685, the same year that James II assumed the throne. Fifty years later, again in Boston, a local minister wrote "a Great number of people went over to <a href="South%20Boston%23History">Dorchester neck</a> where at night they made a Great Bonfire and plaid off many fireworks", although the day ended in tragedy when "4 young men coming home in a Canoe were all Drowned". Ten years later the raucous celebrations were the cause of considerable annoyance to the upper classes and a special Riot Act was passed, to prevent "riotous tumultuous and disorderly assemblies of more than three persons, all or any of them armed with Sticks, Clubs or any kind of weapons, or disguised with vizards, or painted or discolored faces, on in any manner disguised, having any kind of imagery or pageantry, in any street, lane, or place in Boston". With inadequate resources, however, Boston's authorities were powerless to enforce the Act. In the 1740s gang violence became common, with groups of Boston residents battling for the honour of burning the pope's effigy. But by the mid-1760s these riots had subsided, and as colonial America moved towards <a href="American%20Revolution">revolution</a>, the class rivalries featured during Pope Day gave way to anti-British sentiment. In author <a href="Alfred%20F.%20Young">Alfred Young</a>'s view, Pope Day provided the "scaffolding, symbolism, and leadership" for resistance to the <a href="Stamp%20Act%201765">Stamp Act</a> in 1764–65, forgoing previous gang rivalries in favour of unified resistance to Britain.

The passage in 1774 of the <a href="Quebec%20Act">Quebec Act</a>, which guaranteed French Canadians free practice of Catholicism in the <a href="Province%20of%20Quebec%20%281763%E2%80%931791%29">Province of Quebec</a>, provoked complaints from some Americans that the British were introducing "Popish principles and French law". Such fears were bolstered by opposition from the Church in Europe to American independence, threatening a revival of Pope Day. Commenting in 1775, <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> was less than impressed by the thought of any such resurrections, forbidding any under his command from participating:

Generally, following Washington's complaint, American colonists stopped observing Pope Day, although according to <a href="The%20Bostonian%20Society">The Bostonian Society</a> some citizens of Boston celebrated it on one final occasion, in 1776. The tradition continued in <a href="Salem%2C%20Massachusetts">Salem</a> as late as 1817, and was still observed in <a href="Portsmouth%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Portsmouth, New Hampshire</a>, in 1892. In the late 18th century, effigies of prominent figures such as two <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Ministers</a> of Great Britain, the <a href="John%20Stuart%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Bute">Earl of Bute</a> and <a href="Frederick%20North%2C%20Lord%20North">Lord North</a>, and the American traitor General <a href="Benedict%20Arnold">Benedict Arnold</a>, were also burnt. In the 1880s bonfires were still being lit in some New England coastal towns, although no longer to commemorate the failure of the Gunpowder Plot. In the area around New York City, stacks of barrels were burnt on <a href="Election%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">Election Day</a> eve, which after 1845 was a Tuesday early in November.

Rings of Jupiter

The planet <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> has a system of <a href="planetary%20ring">ring</a>s known as the rings of Jupiter or the Jovian ring system. It was the third ring system to be discovered in the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>, after those of <a href="Rings%20of%20Saturn">Saturn</a> and <a href="Rings%20of%20Uranus">Uranus</a>. It was first observed in 1979 by the "<a href="Voyager%201">Voyager 1</a>" <a href="space%20probe">space probe</a> and thoroughly investigated in the 1990s by the "<a href="Galileo%20%28spacecraft%29">Galileo</a>" orbiter. It has also been observed by the <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> and from <a href="Earth">Earth</a> for several years. Ground-based observation of the rings requires the largest available <a href="telescopes">telescopes</a>.

The Jovian ring system is faint and consists mainly of <a href="dust">dust</a>. It has four main components: a thick inner <a href="torus">torus</a> of particles known as the "halo ring"; a relatively bright, exceptionally thin "main ring"; and two wide, thick and faint outer "gossamer rings", named for the moons of whose material they are composed: <a href="Amalthea%20%28moon%29">Amalthea</a> and <a href="Thebe%20%28moon%29">Thebe</a>.

The main and halo rings consist of dust ejected from the <a href="moons">moons</a> <a href="Metis%20%28moon%29">Metis</a>, <a href="Adrastea%20%28moon%29">Adrastea</a>, and other unobserved parent bodies as the result of high-velocity impacts. High-resolution images obtained in February and March 2007 by the "<a href="New%20Horizons">New Horizons</a>" spacecraft revealed a rich fine structure in the main ring.

In visible and near-<a href="infrared">infrared</a> light, the rings have a reddish color, except the halo ring, which is neutral or blue in color. The size of the dust in the rings varies, but the cross-sectional area is greatest for nonspherical particles of radius about 15 <a href="micrometre">μm</a> in all rings except the halo. The halo ring is probably dominated by submicrometre dust. The total mass of the ring system (including unresolved parent bodies) is poorly known, but is probably in the range of 10 to 10 kg. The age of the ring system is not known, but it may have existed since the formation of Jupiter.

A ring could possibly exist in <a href="Himalia%20%28moon%29">Himalia</a>'s orbit. One possible explanation is that a small moon had crashed into Himalia and the force of the impact caused material to blast off Himalia.

Jupiter's ring system was the third to be discovered in the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>, after those of <a href="Rings%20of%20Saturn">Saturn</a> and <a href="Rings%20of%20Uranus">Uranus</a>. It was first observed in 1979 by the "<a href="Voyager%201">Voyager 1</a>" <a href="space%20probe">space probe</a>. It is composed of four main components: a thick inner <a href="torus">torus</a> of particles known as the "halo ring"; a relatively bright, exceptionally thin "main ring"; and two wide, thick and faint outer "gossamer rings", named after the moons of whose material they are composed: Amalthea and Thebe. The principal attributes of the known Jovian Rings are listed in the table.

The narrow and relatively thin main ring is the brightest part of <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>'s ring system. Its outer edge is located at a radius of about (; = equatorial radius of Jupiter or ) and coincides with the orbit of Jupiter's smallest inner satellite, <a href="Adrastea%20%28moon%29">Adrastea</a>. Its inner edge is not marked by any satellite and is located at about ().

Thus the width of the main ring is around . The appearance of the main ring depends on the viewing geometry. In forward-scattered light the brightness of the main ring begins to decrease steeply at (just inward of the Adrastean orbit) and reaches the background level at —just outward of the Adrastean orbit. Therefore, Adrastea at clearly shepherds the ring. The brightness continues to increase in the direction of Jupiter and has a maximum near the ring’s center at , although there is a pronounced gap (notch) near the <a href="Metis%20%28moon%29">Metidian</a> orbit at . The inner boundary of the main ring, in contrast, appears to fade off slowly from to , merging into the halo ring. In forward-scattered light all Jovian rings are especially bright.
In back-scattered light the situation is different. The outer boundary of the main ring, located at , or slightly beyond the orbit of Adrastea, is very steep. The orbit of the moon is marked by a gap in the ring so there is a thin ringlet just outside its orbit. There is another ringlet just inside Adrastean orbit followed by a gap of unknown origin located at about . The third ringlet is found inward of the central gap, outside the orbit of Metis. The ring’s brightness drops sharply just outward of the Metidian orbit, forming the Metis notch. Inward of the orbit of Metis, the brightness of the ring rises much less than in forward-scattered light. So in the back-scattered geometry the main ring appears to consist of two different parts: a narrow outer part extending from to , which itself includes three narrow ringlets separated by notches, and a fainter inner part from to , which lacks any visible structure like in the forward-scattering geometry. The Metis notch serves as their boundary. The fine structure of the main ring was discovered in data from the "<a href="Galileo%20%28spacecraft%29">Galileo</a>" orbiter and is clearly visible in back-scattered images obtained from "<a href="New%20Horizons">New Horizons</a>" in February–March 2007. The early observations by <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> (HST), <a href="W.%20M.%20Keck%20Observatory">Keck</a> and the "<a href="Cassini%20Huygens">Cassini</a>" spacecraft failed to detect it, probably due to insufficient spatial resolution. However the fine structure was observed by the Keck telescope using <a href="adaptive%20optics">adaptive optics</a> in 2002–2003.

Observed in back-scattered light the main ring appears to be razor thin, extending in the vertical direction no more than 30 km. In the side scatter geometry the ring thickness is 80–160 km, increasing somewhat in the direction of <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>. The ring appears to be much thicker in the forward-scattered light—about 300 km. One of the discoveries of the "<a href="Galileo%20%28spacecraft%29">Galileo</a>" orbiter was the bloom of the main ring—a faint, relatively thick (about 600 km) cloud of material which surrounds its inner part. The bloom grows in thickness towards the inner boundary of the main ring, where it transitions into the halo.

Detailed analysis of the "<a href="Galileo%20%28spacecraft%29">Galileo</a>" images revealed longitudinal variations of the main ring’s brightness unconnected with the viewing geometry. The Galileo images also showed some patchiness in the ring on the scales 500–1000 km.

In February–March 2007 "<a href="New%20Horizons">New Horizons</a>" spacecraft conducted a deep search for new small moons inside the main ring. While no satellites larger than 0.5 km were found, the cameras of the spacecraft detected seven small clumps of ring particles. They orbit just inside the orbit of Adrastea inside a dense ringlet. The conclusion, that they are clumps and not small moons, is based on their <a href="azimuthal">azimuthal</a>ly extended appearance. They subtend 0.1–0.3° along the ring, which correspond to 1000–3000 km. The clumps are divided into two groups of five and two members, respectively. The nature of the clumps is not clear, but their orbits are close to 115:116 and 114:115 <a href="orbital%20resonance">resonance</a>s with Metis. They may be wavelike structures excited by this interaction.

<a href="spectrum">Spectra</a> of the main ring obtained by the <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">HST</a>, <a href="W.%20M.%20Keck%20Observatory">Keck</a>, <a href="Galileo%20%28spacecraft%29">Galileo</a> and "<a href="Cassini%20Huygens">Cassini</a>" have shown that particles forming it are red, i.e. their <a href="albedo">albedo</a> is higher at longer wavelengths. The existing spectra span the range 0.5–2.5 μm. No spectral features have been found so far which can be attributed to particular chemical compounds, although the Cassini observations yielded evidence for absorption bands near 0.8 μm and 2.2 μm. The spectra of the main ring are very similar to Adrastea and Amalthea.

The properties of the main ring can be explained by the hypothesis that it contains significant amounts of <a href="dust">dust</a> with 0.1–10 μm particle sizes. This explains the stronger forward-scattering of light as compared to back-scattering. However, larger bodies are required to explain the strong back-scattering and fine structure in the bright outer part of the main ring.

Analysis of available phase and spectral data leads to a conclusion that the size distribution of small particles in the main ring obeys a <a href="power%20law">power law</a>

where "n"("r") "dr" is a number of particles with <a href="radius">radii</a> between "r" and "r" + "dr" and formula_2 is a normalizing parameter chosen to match the known total light <a href="flux">flux</a> from the ring. The parameter "q" is 2.0 ± 0.2 for particles with "r" < 15 ± 0.3 μm and "q" = 5 ± 1 for those with "r" > 15 ± 0.3 μm. The distribution of large bodies in the mm–km size range is undetermined presently. The light scattering in this model is dominated by particles with "r" around 15 μm.

The power law mentioned above allows estimation of the <a href="optical%20depth">optical depth</a> formula_3 of the main ring: formula_4 for the large bodies and formula_5 for the dust. This <a href="optical%20depth">optical depth</a> means that the total cross section of all particles inside the ring is about 5000 km². The particles in the main ring are expected to have aspherical shapes. The total mass of the dust is estimated to be 10−10 kg. The mass of large bodies, excluding Metis and Adrastea, is 10−10 kg. It depends on their maximum size— the upper value corresponds to about 1 km maximum diameter. These masses can be compared with masses of Adrastea, which is about 2 kg, Amalthea, about 2 kg, and Earth's <a href="Moon">Moon</a>, 7.4 kg.

The presence of two populations of particles in the main ring explains why its appearance depends on the viewing geometry. The dust scatters light preferably in the forward direction and forms a relatively thick homogenous ring bounded by the orbit of Adrastea. In contrast, large particles, which scatter in the back direction, are confined in a number of ringlets between the Metidian and Adrastean orbits.

The dust is constantly being removed from the main ring by a combination of <a href="Poynting%E2%80%93Robertson%20drag">Poynting–Robertson drag</a> and electromagnetic forces from the <a href="Jupiter%23Magnetosphere">Jovian magnetosphere</a>. Volatile materials, for example ices, evaporate quickly. The lifetime of dust particles in the ring is from 100 to 1000 years, so the dust must be continuously replenished in the collisions between large bodies with sizes from 1 cm to 0.5 km and between the same large bodies and high velocity particles coming from outside the Jovian system. This parent body population is confined to the narrow—about 1000 km—and bright outer part of the main ring, and includes Metis and Adrastea. The largest parent bodies must be less than 0.5 km in size. The upper limit on their size was obtained by "<a href="New%20Horizons">New Horizons</a>" spacecraft. The previous upper limit, obtained from <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">HST</a> and "<a href="Cassini%20Huygens">Cassini</a>" observations, was near 4 km. The dust produced in collisions retains approximately the same orbital elements as the parent bodies and slowly spirals in the direction of <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> forming the faint (in back-scattered light) innermost part of the main ring and halo ring. The age of the main ring is currently unknown, but it may be the last remnant of a past population of small bodies near <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>.

Images from the "Galileo" and "New Horizons" space probes show the presence of two sets of spiraling vertical corrugations in the main ring. These waves became more tightly wound over time at the rate expected for differential nodal regression in Jupiter's gravity field. Extrapolating backwards, the more prominent of the two sets of waves appears to have been excited in 1995, around the time of the impact of <a href="Comet%20Shoemaker-Levy%209">Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9</a> with Jupiter, while the smaller set appears to date to the first half of 1990. "Galileo"'s November 1996 observations are consistent with wavelengths of and , and vertical amplitudes of and , for the larger and smaller sets of waves, respectively. The formation of the larger set of waves can be explained if the ring was impacted by a cloud of particles released by the comet with a total mass on the order of 2–5 × 10 kg, which would have tilted the ring out of the equatorial plane by 2 km. A similar spiraling wave pattern that tightens over time has been observed by "Cassini" in Saturns's <a href="Rings%20of%20Saturn%23C%20Ring">C</a> and <a href="Rings%20of%20Saturn%23D%20Ring">D</a> rings.

The halo ring is the innermost and the vertically thickest Jovian ring. Its outer edge coincides with the inner boundary of the main ring approximately at the radius (). From this radius the ring becomes rapidly thicker towards Jupiter. The true vertical extent of the halo is not known but the presence of its material was detected as high as over the ring plane. The inner boundary of the halo is relatively sharp and located at the radius (), but some material is present further inward to approximately . Thus the width of the halo ring is about . Its shape resembles a thick torus without clear internal structure. In contrast to the main ring, the halo's appearance depends only slightly on the viewing geometry.

The halo ring appears brightest in forward-scattered light, in which it was extensively imaged by "<a href="Galileo%20%28spacecraft%29">Galileo</a>". While its surface brightness is much less than that of the main ring, its vertically (perpendicular to the ring plane) integrated photon <a href="flux">flux</a> is comparable due to its much larger thickness. Despite a claimed vertical extent of more than , the halo’s brightness is strongly concentrated towards the ring plane and follows a power law of the form "z" to "z", where "z" is altitude over the ring plane. The halo’s appearance in the back-scattered light, as observed by <a href="W.%20M.%20Keck%20Observatory">Keck</a> and <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">HST</a>, is the same. However its total photon flux is several times lower than that of the main ring and is more strongly concentrated near the ring plane than in the forward-scattered light.

The <a href="spectrum">spectral properties</a> of the halo ring are different from the main ring. The <a href="flux">flux</a> distribution in the range 0.5–2.5 μm is flatter than in the main ring; the halo is not red and may even be blue.

The optical properties of the halo ring can be explained by the hypothesis that it comprises only dust with particle sizes less than 15 μm. Parts of the halo located far from the ring plane may consist of submicrometre dust. This dusty composition explains the much stronger forward-scattering, bluer colors and lack of visible structure in the halo. The dust probably originates in the main ring, a claim supported by the fact that the halo’s <a href="optical%20depth">optical depth</a> formula_6 is comparable with that of the dust in the main ring. The large thickness of the halo can be attributed to the excitation of <a href="orbital%20inclination">orbital inclination</a>s and <a href="orbital%20eccentricity">eccentricities</a> of dust particles by the electromagnetic forces in the Jovian magnetosphere. The outer boundary of the halo ring coincides with location of a strong 3:2 Lorentz resonance. As <a href="Poynting%E2%80%93Robertson%20drag">Poynting–Robertson drag</a> causes particles to slowly drift towards Jupiter, their <a href="orbital%20inclination">orbital inclination</a>s are excited while passing through it. The bloom of the main ring may be a beginning of the halo. The halo ring’s inner boundary is not far from the strongest 2:1 Lorentz resonance. In this resonance the excitation is probably very significant, forcing particles to plunge into the Jovian atmosphere thus defining a sharp inner boundary. Being derived from the main ring, the halo has the same age.

The Amalthea gossamer ring is a very faint structure with a rectangular cross section, stretching from the orbit of Amalthea at (2.54 "R") to about (). Its inner boundary is not clearly defined because of the presence of the much brighter main ring and halo. The thickness of the ring is approximately 2300 km near the orbit of Amalthea and slightly decreases in the direction of <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>. The Amalthea gossamer ring is actually the brightest near its top and bottom edges and becomes gradually brighter towards Jupiter; one of the edges is often brighter than another. The outer boundary of the ring is relatively steep; the ring's brightness drops abruptly just inward of the orbit of Amalthea, although it may have a small extension beyond the orbit of the satellite ending near 4:3 resonance with Thebe. In forward-scattered light the ring appears to be about 30 times fainter than the main ring. In back-scattered light it has been detected only by the <a href="W.%20M.%20Keck%20Observatory">Keck</a> telescope and the ACS (<a href="Advanced%20Camera%20for%20Surveys">Advanced Camera for Surveys</a>) on <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">HST</a>. Back-scattering images show additional structure in the ring: a peak in the brightness just inside the Amalthean orbit and confined to the top or bottom edge of the ring.

In 2002–2003 Galileo spacecraft had two passes through the gossamer rings. During them its dust counter detected dust particles in the size range 0.2–5 μm. In addition, the Galileo spacecraft's star scanner detected small, discrete bodies (< 1 km) near Amalthea. These may represent collisional debris generated from impacts with this satellite.

The detection of the Amalthea gossamer ring from the ground, in "<a href="Galileo%20%28spacecraft%29">Galileo</a>" images and the direct dust measurements have allowed the determination of the particle size distribution, which appears to follow the same power law as the dust in the main ring with "q"=2 ± 0.5. The <a href="optical%20depth">optical depth</a> of this ring is about 10, which is an order of magnitude lower than that of the main ring, but the total mass of the dust (10–10 kg) is comparable.

The Thebe gossamer ring is the faintest Jovian ring. It appears as a very faint structure with a rectangular cross section, stretching from the Thebean orbit at () to about (;). Its inner boundary is not clearly defined because of the presence of the much brighter main ring and halo. The thickness of the ring is approximately 8400 km near the orbit of Thebe and slightly decreases in the direction of the planet. The Thebe gossamer ring is brightest near its top and bottom edges and gradually becomes brighter towards <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>—much like the Amalthea ring. The outer boundary of the ring is not especially steep, stretching over . There is a barely visible continuation of the ring beyond the orbit of Thebe, extending up to () and called the Thebe Extension. In forward-scattered light the ring appears to be about 3 times fainter than the Amalthea gossamer ring. In back-scattered light it has been detected only by the <a href="W.%20M.%20Keck%20Observatory">Keck</a> telescope. Back-scattering images show a peak of brightness just inside the orbit of Thebe. In 2002–2003 the dust counter of the Galileo spacecraft detected dust particles in the size range 0.2–5 μm—similar to those in the Amalthea ring—and confirmed the results obtained from imaging.

The <a href="optical%20depth">optical depth</a> of the Thebe gossamer ring is about 3, which is three times lower than the Amalthea gossamer ring, but the total mass of the dust is the same—about 10–10 kg. However the particle size distribution of the dust is somewhat shallower than in the Amalthea ring. It follows a power law with q < 2. In the Thebe extension the parameter q may be even smaller.

The dust in the gossamer rings originates in essentially the same way as that in the main ring and halo. Its sources are the inner Jovian moons Amalthea and Thebe respectively. High velocity impacts by projectiles coming from outside the Jovian system eject dust particles from their surfaces. These particles initially retain the same orbits as their moons but then gradually spiral inward by <a href="Poynting%E2%80%93Robertson%20drag">Poynting–Robertson drag</a>. The thickness of the gossamer rings is determined by vertical excursions of the moons due to their nonzero <a href="orbital%20inclination">orbital inclination</a>s. This hypothesis naturally explains almost all observable properties of the rings: rectangular cross-section, decrease of thickness in the direction of <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> and brightening of the top and bottom edges of the rings.

However some properties have so far gone unexplained, like the Thebe Extension, which may be due to unseen bodies outside Thebe's orbit, and structures visible in the back-scattered light. One possible explanation of the Thebe Extension is influence of the electromagnetic forces from the Jovian magnetosphere. When the dust enters the shadow behind Jupiter, it loses its electrical charge fairly quickly. Since the small dust particles partially corotate with the planet, they will move outward during the shadow pass creating an outward extension of the Thebe gossamer ring. The same forces can explain a dip in the particle distribution and ring's brightness, which occurs between the orbits of Amalthea and Thebe.

The peak in the brightness just inside of the Amalthea's orbit and, therefore, the vertical asymmetry the Amalthea gossamer ring may be due to the dust particles trapped at the leading (L) and trailing (L) <a href="Lagrange%20point">Lagrange point</a>s of this moon. The particles may also follow <a href="horseshoe%20orbits">horseshoe orbits</a> between the Lagrangian points. The dust may be present at the leading and trailing Lagrange points of Thebe as well. This discovery implies that there are two particle populations in the gossamer rings: one slowly drifts in the direction of Jupiter as described above, while another remains near a source moon trapped in 1:1 resonance with it.

The small moon <a href="Dia%20%28moon%29">Dia</a>, 4 kilometres in diameter, had gone missing since its discovery in 2000. One theory was that it had crashed into the much larger moon <a href="Himalia%20%28moon%29">Himalia</a>, 170 kilometres in diameter, creating a faint ring. This possible ring appears as a faint streak near Himalia in images from NASA's "<a href="New%20Horizons">New Horizons</a> "mission to <a href="Pluto">Pluto</a>. This suggests that Jupiter sometimes gains and loses small moons through collisions. However, the rediscovery of Dia in 2010 and 2011 disproves the link between Dia and the Himalia ring, although it is still possible that a different moon may have been involved.

The existence of the Jovian rings was inferred from observations of the planetary <a href="radiation%20belt">radiation belt</a>s by <a href="Pioneer%2011">Pioneer 11</a> spacecraft in 1975. In 1979 the "<a href="Voyager%201">Voyager 1</a>" spacecraft obtained a single overexposed image of the ring system. More extensive imaging was conducted by "<a href="Voyager%202">Voyager 2</a>" in the same year, which allowed rough determination of the ring’s structure. The superior quality of the images obtained by the "<a href="Galileo%20%28spacecraft%29">Galileo</a>" orbiter between 1995 and 2003 greatly extended the existing knowledge about the Jovian rings. Ground-based observation of the rings by the <a href="W.%20M.%20Keck%20Observatory">Keck</a> telescope in 1997 and 2002 and the <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">HST</a> in 1999 revealed the rich structure visible in back-scattered light. Images transmitted by the "New Horizons" spacecraft in February–March 2007 allowed observation of the fine structure in the main ring for the first time. In 2000, the "<a href="Cassini%20Huygens">Cassini</a>" spacecraft en route to <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a> conducted extensive observations of the Jovian ring system. Future missions to the Jovian system will provide additional information about the rings.

Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia

Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia (; – 24 November 1960) was the youngest child of Emperor <a href="Alexander%20III%20of%20Russia">Alexander III of Russia</a> and younger sister of Emperor <a href="Nicholas%20II">Nicholas II</a>.

She was raised at the <a href="Gatchina%20Palace">Gatchina Palace</a> outside <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>. Olga's relationship with her mother, Empress <a href="Maria%20Feodorovna%20%28Dagmar%20of%20Denmark%29">Marie</a>, the daughter of King <a href="Christian%20IX%20of%20Denmark">Christian IX of Denmark</a>, was strained and distant from childhood. In contrast, she and her father were close. He died when she was 12, and her brother Nicholas became emperor.

In 1901, at 19, she married <a href="Duke%20Peter%20Alexandrovich%20of%20Oldenburg">Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg</a>, who was privately believed by family and friends to be homosexual. Their marriage of 15 years remained unconsummated, and Peter at first refused Olga's request for a divorce. The couple led separate lives and their marriage was eventually annulled by the Emperor in October 1916. The following month Olga married cavalry officer <a href="Nikolai%20Kulikovsky">Nikolai Kulikovsky</a>, with whom she had fallen in love several years before. During the First World War, the Grand Duchess served as an army nurse and was awarded a medal for personal gallantry. At the downfall of the <a href="Romanov">Romanov</a>s in the <a href="Russian%20Revolution%20of%201917">Russian Revolution of 1917</a>, she fled with her husband and children to <a href="Crimea">Crimea</a>, where they lived under the threat of assassination. Her brother Nicholas and his family were <a href="Shooting%20of%20the%20Romanov%20family">shot by revolutionaries</a>.

Olga escaped revolutionary Russia with her second husband and their two sons in February 1920. They joined her mother, the Dowager Empress, in Denmark. In exile, Olga acted as companion and secretary to her mother, and was often sought out by <a href="Romanov%20impostors">Romanov impostors</a> who claimed to be her dead relatives. She met <a href="Anna%20Anderson">Anna Anderson</a>, the best-known impostor, in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> in 1925. After the Dowager Empress's death in 1928, Olga and her husband purchased a dairy farm in <a href="Ballerup">Ballerup</a>, near Copenhagen. She led a simple life: raising her two sons, working on the farm and painting. During her lifetime, she painted over 2,000 works of art, which provided extra income for both her family and the charitable causes she supported.

In 1948, feeling threatened by <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>'s regime, Olga and her immediate family relocated to a farm in <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>, Canada. With advancing age, Olga and her husband moved to a bungalow near <a href="Cooksville%2C%20Ontario">Cooksville, Ontario</a>. Colonel Kulikovsky died there in 1958. Two years later, as her health deteriorated, Olga moved with friends to a small apartment in East <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>. She died aged 78, seven months after her older sister, <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Xenia%20Alexandrovna%20of%20Russia">Xenia</a>. At the end of her life and afterwards, Olga was widely labelled the last Grand Duchess of Imperial Russia.

Olga was the youngest daughter of <a href="Alexander%20III%20of%20Russia">Emperor Alexander III</a> and his consort, <a href="Maria%20Feodorovna%20%28Dagmar%20of%20Denmark%29">Empress Marie</a>, formerly Princess Dagmar of Denmark. She was <a href="born%20in%20the%20purple">born in the purple</a> (i.e., during her father's reign) on 13 June 1882 in the <a href="Peterhof%20Palace">Peterhof Palace</a>, west of central <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>. Her birth was announced by a traditional 101-gun salute from the ramparts of the <a href="Peter%20and%20Paul%20Fortress">Peter and Paul Fortress</a>, and similar salutes throughout the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>. Her mother, advised by her sister, <a href="Alexandra%20of%20Denmark">Alexandra, Princess of Wales</a>, placed Olga in the care of an English nanny, Elizabeth Franklin.

The Russian imperial family was a frequent target for assassins, so for safety reasons the Grand Duchess was raised at the country palace of <a href="Gatchina">Gatchina</a>, about 50 miles (80 km) west of Saint Petersburg. Although Olga and her siblings lived in a palace, conditions in the nursery were modest, even Spartan. They slept on hard camp beds, rose at dawn, washed in cold water, and ate a simple porridge for breakfast.

Olga left Gatchina for the first time in 1888 when the imperial family visited the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a>. On 29 October, their return train approached the small town of <a href="Borki%20%28Kharkiv%20oblast%29">Borki</a> at speed. Olga's parents and their four older children were eating lunch in the dining-car when the train lurched violently and came off the rails. The carriage was torn open; the heavy iron roof caved in, and the wheels and floor of the car were sliced off. Survivors claimed the Tsar crawled out from beneath the crushed roof, and held it up with "a Herculean effort" so that the others could escape; a story subsequently considered unbelievable. There were 21 fatalities. Empress Marie helped tend the wounded, and made makeshift bandages from her own clothes. An official investigation found that <a href="Borki%20train%20disaster">the crash</a> was an accident, but it was widely and falsely believed that two bombs had been planted on the line.

The Grand Duchess and her siblings were taught at home by private tutors. Subjects included history, geography, Russian, English, and French, as well as drawing and dancing. Physical activities such as <a href="equestrianism">equestrianism</a> were taught at an early age, and the children became expert riders.

The family was deeply religious. While Christmas and Easter were times of celebration and extravagance, <a href="Lent">Lent</a> was strictly observed—meat, dairy products and any form of entertainment were avoided. 

Empress Marie was reserved and formal with Olga as a child, and their relationship remained a difficult one. But Olga, her father, and the youngest of her brothers, <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Michael%20Alexandrovich%20of%20Russia">Michael</a>, had a close relationship. Together, the three frequently went on hikes in the Gatchina forests, where the Tsar taught Olga and Michael woodsmanship. Olga said of her father:
Family holidays were taken in the summer at Peterhof, and with Olga's grandparents in Denmark. However, in 1894, Olga's father became increasingly ill, and the annual trip to Denmark was cancelled. On 13 November 1894, he died at the age of 49. The emotional impact on Olga, aged 12, was traumatic, and her eldest brother, the new <a href="Tsar%20Nicholas%20II">Tsar Nicholas II</a>, was propelled into a role for which, in Olga's later opinion, he was ill-prepared.

Olga was due to enter society in mid-1899, but after the death of her brother <a href="Grand%20Duke%20George%20Alexandrovich%20of%20Russia">George</a> at the age of 28, her first official public appearance was delayed by a year until 1900. She hated the experience, and later told her official biographer Ian Vorres, "I felt as though I were an animal in a cage—exhibited to the public for the first time." From 1901, Olga was appointed honorary Commander-in-Chief of the 12th Akhtyrsky Hussar Regiment of the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Army">Imperial Russian Army</a>. The Akhtyrsky Hussars were famous for their victory over <a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kulm">Battle of Kulm</a> in 1813, and wore a distinctive brown <a href="dolman">dolman</a>.

By 1900, Olga, age 18, was being escorted to the theatre and opera by a distant cousin, <a href="Duke%20Peter%20Alexandrovich%20of%20Oldenburg">Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg</a>, a member of the Russian branch of the <a href="House%20of%20Oldenburg">House of Oldenburg</a>. He was 14 years her senior and known for his passion for literature and gambling. Peter asked for Olga's hand in marriage the following year, a proposal that took the Grand Duchess completely by surprise: "I was so taken aback that all I could say was 'thank you'," she later explained.
Their engagement, announced in May 1901, was unexpected by family and friends, as Peter had shown no prior interest in women, and members of society assumed he was homosexual. At the age of 19, on 9 August 1901, Olga married 33-year-old Peter. After the celebration the newlyweds left for the Oldenburg palace on the <a href="Field%20of%20Mars%20%28Saint%20Petersburg%29">Field of Mars</a>. Olga spent her wedding night alone in tears, while her husband left for a gambling club returning the next morning. Their marriage remained unconsummated, and Olga suspected that Peter was pushed into proposing by his ambitious mother. Biographer Patricia Phenix thought Olga may have accepted his proposal to gain independence from her own mother, the Dowager Empress, or avoid marriage into a foreign court. The couple initially lived with her in-laws <a href="Duke%20Alexander%20Petrovich%20of%20Oldenburg">Alexander Petrovich</a> and <a href="Princess%20Eugenia%20Maximilianovna%20of%20Leuchtenberg">Eugénie Maximilianovna</a> of Oldenburg. The arrangement was not harmonious as Peter's parents, both well known for their philanthropic work, berated their only son for his laziness. Olga took a dislike towards her mother-in-law; although Eugénie, a close friend of the Dowager Empress, gave her daughter-in-law many gifts, including a ruby tiara that had been a present to <a href="Jos%C3%A9phine%20de%20Beauharnais">Joséphine de Beauharnais</a> from <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>. A few weeks after the wedding, Olga and her husband travelled to <a href="Biarritz">Biarritz</a>, France, from where they sailed to <a href="Sorrento">Sorrento</a>, Italy, on a yacht loaned to them by King <a href="Edward%20VII">Edward VII</a> of Great Britain.

On their return to Russia, they settled into a 200-room palace (the former Baryatinsky mansion) at 46 Sergievskaya Street (today Tchaikovsky Street), Saint Petersburg. The palace, a gift from Tsar Nicholas II to his sister, now houses the Saint Petersburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Olga and Peter had separate bedrooms at opposite ends of the building, and the Grand Duchess had her own art studio. Unhappy in her marriage, she fell into bouts of depression that caused her to lose her hair, forcing her to wear a wig. It took two years for her hair to regrow.

Near the Oldenburg's estate, <a href="Ramon%2C%20Russia">Ramon</a> in <a href="Voronezh%20Oblast">Voronezh province</a>, Olga had her own villa, called "Olgino" after the local town. She subsidized the village school out of her own pocket, and established a hospital. Her daughter-in-law later wrote, "She tried to help every needy person as far as her strengths and means would permit." At the hospital, she learned basic medical treatment and proper care from the local doctor. She exemplified her strong <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox</a> faith by creating religious icons, which she distributed to the charitable endeavours she supported. At Ramon, Olga and Peter enjoyed walking through the nearby woods and hunted wolves together. He was kind and considerate towards her, but she longed for love, a normal marriage, and children.

In April 1903, she was introduced to a Blue <a href="Cuirassier">Cuirassier</a> Guards officer <a href="Nikolai%20Kulikovsky">Nikolai Kulikovsky</a> by her brother Michael during a royal military review at <a href="Pavlovsk%20Palace">Pavlovsk Palace</a>. Olga and Kulikovsky began to see each other, and exchanged letters regularly. The same year, at the age of 22, she confronted her husband and asked for a divorce, which he refused with the qualification that he might reconsider after seven years. Nevertheless, Oldenburg appointed Kulikovsky as an <a href="aide-de-camp">aide-de-camp</a>, and allowed him to live in the same residence as Oldenburg and the Grand Duchess on Sergievskaya Street. The relationship between Kulikovsky and the Grand Duchess was not public, but gossip about their romance spread through society.

From 1904 to 1906, Duke Peter was appointed to a military post in <a href="Tsarskoye%20Selo">Tsarskoye Selo</a>, a complex of palaces just south of Saint Petersburg. In Tsarskoye Selo, the Grand Duchess grew close to her brother Nicholas and his family, who lived at the <a href="Alexander%20Palace">Alexander Palace</a> near her own residence. Olga prized her connection to the Tsar's four daughters. From 1906 to 1914, Olga took her nieces to parties and engagements in Saint Petersburg, without their parents, every weekend throughout the winter. She especially took a liking to the youngest of Nicholas's daughters, her god-daughter Anastasia, whom she called "Shvipsik" ("little one"). Through her brother and sister-in-law, Olga met <a href="Rasputin">Rasputin</a>, a self-styled holy man who purported to have healing powers. Although she made no public criticisms of Rasputin's association with the imperial family, she was unconvinced of his supposed powers and privately disliked him. As Olga grew close to her brother's family, her relationship with her other surviving brother, Michael, deteriorated. To her and Nicholas's horror, Michael eloped with his mistress, a twice-divorced commoner, and communication between Michael and the rest of the family was essentially cut off.

Public unrest over the <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">Russo-Japanese War</a> and <a href="1905%20Russian%20Revolution">demands for political reform</a> increased in the early years of the twentieth century. At <a href="Epiphany%20%28holiday%29">Epiphany</a> 1905, a band of revolutionaries fired live rounds at the <a href="Winter%20Palace">Winter Palace</a> from the <a href="Peter%20and%20Paul%20Fortress">Peter and Paul Fortress</a>. Olga and the Dowager Empress were showered with glass splinters from a smashed window, but were unharmed. Three weeks later, on "<a href="Bloody%20Sunday%20%281905%29">Bloody Sunday</a>", at least 92 people were killed by <a href="Cossack">Cossack</a> troops during a demonstration, and a month later Olga's uncle, <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Sergei%20Alexandrovich%20of%20Russia">Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia</a>, was assassinated. Uprisings occurred throughout the country, and parts of the navy mutinied. Olga supported the appointment of the liberal <a href="Pyotr%20Stolypin">Pyotr Stolypin</a> as prime minister, and he embarked on a <a href="Stolypin%20reform">programme of gradual reform</a>, but in 1911 he was assassinated. The public unrest, Michael's elopement, and Olga's sham marriage placed her under strain, and in 1912, while visiting England with her mother, she suffered a nervous breakdown. <a href="Alexandra%20Feodorovna%20%28Alix%20of%20Hesse%29">Tsarina Alexandra</a> was also unwell with fatigue, concerned by the poor health of her <a href="hemophilia">hemophilia</a>c son, <a href="Tsarevich%20Alexei%20Nikolaevich%20of%20Russia">Alexei</a>. Olga stood in for the Tsarina at public events, and accompanied her brother on a tour of the interior, while the Tsarina remained at home.

On 1 August 1914, with <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> looming, Olga's regiment, the Akhtyrsky Hussars, appeared at an Imperial Review before her and the Tsar at <a href="Krasnoe%20Selo">Krasnoe Selo</a>. Kulikovsky volunteered for service with the Hussars, who were stationed on the frontlines in Southwestern Russia. With the Grand Duchess's prior medical knowledge from the village of Olgino, she started work as a nurse at an under-staffed Red Cross hospital in <a href="Rovno">Rovno</a>, near to where her own regiment was stationed. During the war, she came under heavy Austrian fire while attending the regiment at the front. Nurses rarely worked so close to the frontline and consequently she was awarded the <a href="Order%20of%20St.%20George">Order of St. George</a> by <a href="Carl%20Gustaf%20Emil%20Mannerheim">General Mannerheim</a>, who later became <a href="President%20of%20Finland">President of Finland</a>. As the Russians lost ground to the <a href="Central%20Powers">Central Powers</a>, Olga's hospital was moved eastwards to <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a>, and Michael returned to Russia from exile abroad.

In 1916, <a href="Tsar%20Nicholas%20II">Tsar Nicholas II</a> annulled the marriage between Duke Peter Alexandrovich and the Grand Duchess, allowing her to marry Colonel Kulikovsky. The service was performed on 16 November 1916 in the Kievo-Vasilievskaya Church on Triokhsviatitelskaya (Three Saints Street) in Kiev. The only guests were the Dowager Empress, Olga's brother-in-law <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Alexander%20Mikhailovich%20of%20Russia">Grand Duke Alexander</a>, four officers of the Akhtyrsky Regiment, and two of Olga's fellow nurses from the hospital in Kiev.

During the war, internal tensions and economic deprivation in Russia continued to mount and revolutionary sympathies grew. After Tsar Nicholas II abdicated in early 1917, many members of the Romanov dynasty, including Nicholas and his immediate family, were detained under house arrest. In search of safety, the Dowager Empress, Grand Duke Alexander, and Grand Duchess Olga travelled to <a href="Crimea">Crimea</a> by special train, where they were joined by Olga's sister (Alexander's wife) <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Xenia%20Alexandrovna%20of%20Russia">Grand Duchess Xenia</a>. They lived at Alexander's estate, Ay-Todor, about 12 miles (19 km) from <a href="Yalta">Yalta</a>, where they were placed under house arrest by the local forces. On 12 August 1917, her first child and son, Tikhon Nikolaevich was born during their virtual imprisonment. He was named after <a href="Tikhon%20of%20Zadonsk">Tikhon of Zadonsk</a>, the Saint venerated near the Grand Duchess's estate at Olgino.

The Romanovs isolated in Crimea knew little of the fate of the Tsar and his family. Nicholas, Alexandra, and their children, were originally held at their official residence, the Alexander Palace, but the Provisional government under <a href="Alexander%20Kerensky">Alexander Kerensky</a> relocated them to <a href="Tobolsk">Tobolsk</a>, <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>. In February 1918, most of the imperial family at Ay-Todor was moved to another estate at Djulber, where Grand Dukes <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Nicholas%20Nikolaevich%20of%20Russia%20%281856%E2%80%931929%29">Nicholas</a> and <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Peter%20Nikolaevich%20of%20Russia">Peter</a> were already under house arrest. Olga and her husband were left at Ay-Todor. The entire Romanov family in Crimea was condemned to death by the <a href="Yalta">Yalta</a> revolutionary council, but the executions were delayed by political rivalry between the Yalta and <a href="Sevastopol">Sevastopol</a> <a href="Soviet%20%28council%29">Soviets</a>. By March 1918, the <a href="Central%20Powers">Central Power</a> of <a href="Germany">Germany</a> had advanced on Crimea, and the revolutionary guards were replaced by German ones. In November 1918, the German forces were informed that their nation had lost the war, and they evacuated homewards. <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allied</a> forces took over the Crimean ports, in support of the loyalist <a href="White%20Army">White Army</a>, which allowed the surviving members of the Romanov family time to escape abroad. The Dowager Empress and, at her insistence, most of her family and friends were evacuated by the British warship <a href="HMS%20Marlborough%20%281912%29">HMS "Marlborough"</a>. Nicholas II had already been shot dead and the family assumed, correctly, that <a href="Execution%20of%20the%20Romanov%20family">his wife and children had also been killed</a>.

Olga and her husband refused to leave Russia, and decided to move to the Caucasus, which the <a href="White%20Army">White Army</a> had cleared of revolutionary <a href="Bolsheviks">Bolsheviks</a>. An imperial bodyguard, Timofei Yatchik, guided them to his hometown, the large <a href="Cossack">Cossack</a> village of Novominskaya. In a rented five-room farmhouse there, Olga gave birth to her second son, Guri Nikolaevich, on 23 April 1919. He was named after a friend of hers, Guri Panayev, who was killed while serving in the Akhtyrsky Regiment during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. In November 1919, the family set out on what would be their last journey through Russia. Just ahead of revolutionary troops, they escaped to <a href="Novorossiysk">Novorossiysk</a>, and took refuge in the residence of the Danish consul, Thomas Schytte, who informed them of the Dowager Empress's safe arrival in Denmark. After a brief stay with the consul, the family was shipped to a refugee camp on the island of <a href="B%C3%BCy%C3%BCkada">Büyükada</a> in the <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a> Strait near <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, Turkey, where Olga, her husband and children shared three rooms with eleven other adults. After two weeks, they were evacuated to <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a> in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes where she was visited by <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Yugoslavia">Prince Regent Alexander</a>. Alexander offered the Grand Duchess and her family a permanent home, but Olga was summoned to Denmark by her mother. On Good Friday 1920, Olga and her family arrived in Copenhagen. They lived with the Dowager Empress, at first at the <a href="Amalienborg%20Palace">Amalienborg Palace</a> and then at the royal estate of <a href="Hvid%C3%B8re%20%28building%29">Hvidøre</a>, where Olga acted as her mother's secretary and companion. It was a difficult arrangement at times. The Dowager Empress insisted on having Olga at her beck and call and found Olga's young sons too boisterous. Having never reconciled with the idea of her daughter's marriage to a commoner, she was cold towards Kulikovsky, rarely allowing him in her presence. At formal functions, Olga was expected to accompany her mother alone.

In 1925, Olga and Colonel Kulikovsky travelled to Berlin to meet <a href="Anna%20Anderson">Anna Anderson</a>, who claimed to be Olga's niece, <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Anastasia%20Nikolaevna%20of%20Russia">Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia</a>. Anderson had attempted suicide in Berlin in 1920, which Olga later called "probably the only indisputable fact in the whole story". Anderson claimed that with the help of a man named Tchaikovsky she had escaped from revolutionary Russia via <a href="Bucharest">Bucharest</a>, where she had given birth to his child. Olga thought the story "palpably false", since Anderson made no attempt to approach Queen <a href="Marie%20of%20Romania">Marie of Romania</a>, during her entire alleged time in Bucharest. Olga said:
Anderson stated she was in Berlin to inform <a href="Princess%20Irene%20of%20Hesse%20and%20by%20Rhine">Princess Irene of Prussia</a> (sister of <a href="Alexandra%20Feodorovna%20%28Alix%20of%20Hesse%29">Tsarina Alexandra</a> and cousin of <a href="Tsar%20Nicholas%20II">Tsar Nicholas II</a>) of her survival. Olga commented, "[Princess Irene] was one of the most straightlaced women in her generation. My niece would have known that her condition would have indeed have shocked [her]."

Olga met Anderson, who was being treated for <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, at a nursing home. Of the visit Olga later said:
Olga also said she was dismayed that Anderson spoke only German and showed no sign of knowing either English or Russian, while Anastasia spoke both those languages fluently and was ignorant of German. Nevertheless, Olga remained sympathetic towards Anderson, perhaps because she thought that she was ill rather than deliberately deceitful. Olga later explained:

Conceivably, Olga was initially either open to the possibility that Anderson was Anastasia or unable to make up her mind. Anderson's biographer and supporter Peter Kurth claimed that Olga wrote to the Danish ambassador, <a href="Herluf%20Zahle">Herluf Zahle</a>, at the end of October 1925: "My feeling is that she is not the one she believes—but one can't say she is not as a fact". Within a month she had made up her mind. She wrote to a friend, "There is no resemblance, and she is undoubtedly not A." Olga sent Anderson a scarf and five letters, which were used by Anderson's supporters to claim that Olga recognized Anderson as Anastasia. Olga later said she sent the gift and letters "out of pity", and called the claims "a complete fabrication". When Olga refused to recognize Anderson as Anastasia publicly and published a statement denying any resemblance in a Danish newspaper, Anderson's supporters, <a href="Harriet%20von%20Rathlef">Harriet von Rathlef</a> and <a href="Gleb%20Botkin">Gleb Botkin</a>, claimed that Olga was acting on instructions received from her sister Xenia by telegram, which Olga denied in private letters and sworn testimony. She told her official biographer, "I never received any such telegram." The telegram was never produced by Anderson's supporters, and it has never been found among any of the papers relating to the case. Xenia said,
The Dowager Empress died on 13 October 1928 at Hvidøre. Her estate was sold and Olga purchased "Knudsminde", a farm in <a href="Ballerup">Ballerup</a> about 15 miles (24 km) from Copenhagen, with her portion of the proceeds. She and her husband kept horses, in which Colonel Kulikovsky was especially interested, along with Jersey cows, pigs, chickens, geese, dogs and cats. For transport they had a small car and a sledge. Tihon and Guri (age thirteen and eleven, respectively when they moved to Knudsminde) grew up on the farm. Olga ran the household with the help of her elderly, faithful lady's maid Emilia Tenso ("Mimka"), who had come along with her from Russia. The Grand Duchess lived with simplicity, working in the fields, doing household chores, and painting.

The farm became a center for the Russian monarchist community in Denmark, and many <a href="White%20%C3%A9migr%C3%A9">Russian emigrants</a> visited. Olga maintained a high level of correspondence with the Russian émigré community and former members of the imperial army. On 2 February 1935 in the Russian Orthodox Church in Copenhagen, she and her husband were godparents, with her cousin <a href="Prince%20Gustav%20of%20Denmark">Prince Gustav of Denmark</a>, to Aleksander Schalburg, son of Russian-born Danish army officer <a href="Christian%20Frederik%20von%20Schalburg">Christian Frederik von Schalburg</a>. In the 1930s, the family took annual holidays at <a href="Sofiero%20Castle">Sofiero Castle</a>, Sweden, with <a href="Gustaf%20VI%20Adolf%20of%20Sweden">Crown Prince Gustaf of Sweden</a> and his wife, <a href="Louise%20Mountbatten">Louise</a>. Olga began to sell her own paintings, of Russian and Danish scenes, with exhibition auctions in Copenhagen, London, Paris, and Berlin. Some of the proceeds were donated to the charities she supported.

Neutral Denmark was invaded by <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> on 9 April 1940, and was occupied for the remainder of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Food shortages, communication restrictions, and transport closures followed. As Olga's sons, Tikhon and Guri, served as officers in the <a href="Danish%20Army">Danish Army</a>, they were interned as prisoners of war, but their imprisonment in a Copenhagen hotel lasted less than two months. Tikhon was imprisoned for a further month in 1943 after being arrested on charges of espionage. Other Russian émigrés, keen to fight against the Soviets, enlisted in the German forces. Despite her sons' internment and her mother's Danish origins, Olga was implicated in her compatriots' collusion with German forces, as she continued to meet and extend help to Russian émigrés fighting against communism. On 4 May 1945, German forces in Denmark surrendered to the British. When economic and social conditions for Russian exiles failed to improve, General <a href="Pyotr%20Krasnov">Pyotr Krasnov</a> wrote to the Grand Duchess, detailing the wretched conditions affecting Russian immigrants in Denmark. She in turn asked <a href="Prince%20Axel%20of%20Denmark">Prince Axel of Denmark</a> to help them, but her request was refused.

With the end of World War II, Soviet troops <a href="Bornholm%23Soviet%20Occupation%201945%E2%80%931946">occupied the Danish island of Bornholm</a>, and the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> wrote to the Danish government accusing Olga and a Danish Catholic bishop of conspiracy against the Soviet government. The surviving Romanovs in Denmark grew fearful of an assassination or kidnap attempt, and Olga decided to move her family across the Atlantic to the relative safety of rural Canada.

In May 1948, the Kulikovskys travelled to London by Danish <a href="troopship">troopship</a>. They were housed in a <a href="grace%20and%20favour">grace and favour</a> apartment at <a href="Hampton%20Court%20Palace">Hampton Court Palace</a> while arrangements were made for their journey to Canada as agricultural immigrants. On 2 June 1948, Olga, Kulikovsky, Tikhon and his Danish-born wife Agnete, Guri and his Danish-born wife Ruth, Guri and Ruth's two children, Xenia and Leonid, and Olga's devoted companion and former maid Emilia Tenso ("Mimka") departed <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> on board the "<a href="RMS%20Empress%20of%20Canada%20%281928%29">Empress of Canada</a>". After a rough crossing, the ship docked at <a href="City%20of%20Halifax">Halifax, Nova Scotia</a>. The family lived in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, until they purchased a farm in <a href="Halton%20County%2C%20Ontario">Halton County, Ontario</a>, near <a href="Campbellville%2C%20Ontario">Campbellville</a>.

By 1952, the farm had become a burden to Olga and her husband. They were both elderly; their sons had moved away; labour was hard to come by; the Colonel suffered increasing ill-health, and some of Olga's remaining jewelry was stolen. The farm was sold, and Olga, her husband and her former maid, Mimka, moved to a smaller five-room house at 2130 Camilla Road, <a href="Cooksville%2C%20Ontario">Cooksville, Ontario</a>, a suburb of Toronto now amalgamated into <a href="Mississauga">Mississauga</a>. Mimka suffered a stroke that left her an invalid, and Olga nursed her until Mimka's death on 24 January 1954.

Neighbours and visitors to the region, including foreign and royal dignitaries, took interest in Olga, and visited her home; these included <a href="Princess%20Marina%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Kent">Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent</a>, in 1954, and <a href="Louis%20Mountbatten%2C%201st%20Earl%20Mountbatten%20of%20Burma">Louis Mountbatten</a> and his wife <a href="Edwina%20Mountbatten%2C%20Countess%20Mountbatten%20of%20Burma">Edwina</a>, in August 1959. In June 1959, <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> and <a href="Prince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh">Prince Philip</a> visited Toronto and invited the Grand Duchess for lunch on board the royal yacht <a href="HMY%20Britannia">"Britannia"</a>. Her home was also a magnet for <a href="Romanov%20impostors">Romanov impostors</a>, whom Olga and her family considered a menace.

By 1958, Olga's husband was virtually paralyzed, and she sold some of her remaining jewelry to raise funds. Following her husband's death in 1958, she became increasingly infirm until hospitalized in April 1960 at <a href="Toronto%20General%20Hospital">Toronto General Hospital</a>. She was not informed or was not aware that her elder sister, <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Xenia%20Alexandrovna%20of%20Russia">Xenia</a>, died in London that month. Unable to care for herself, Olga went to stay with Russian émigré friends, Konstantin and Sinaida Martemianoff, in an apartment above a beauty salon at 716 <a href="Gerrard%20Street%20%28Toronto%29">Gerrard Street East, Toronto</a>. She slipped into a coma on 21 November 1960, and died on 24 November at the age of 78.

She was interred next to her husband in <a href="York%20Cemetery%2C%20Toronto">York Cemetery, Toronto</a>, on 30 November 1960, after a funeral service at Christ the Saviour Cathedral, Toronto. Officers of the Akhtyrsky Hussars and the Blue Cuirassiers stood guard in the small Russian church, which overflowed with mourners. Although she lived simply, bought cheap clothes, and did her own shopping and gardening, her estate was valued at more than 200,000 <a href="Canadian%20dollar">Canadian dollar</a>s (about $1.5 million as of 2013) and was mostly held as stock and bonds. Her material possessions were appraised at $350 in total, which biographer Patricia Phenix considered an underestimate.

Olga began drawing and painting at a young age. She told her official biographer Ian Vorres:

She painted throughout her life, on paper, canvas and ceramic, and her output is estimated at over 2,000 pieces. Her usual subject was scenery and landscape, but she also painted portraits and still lifes. Vorres wrote,

Her paintings were a profitable source of income. According to her daughter-in-law, Olga preferred to exhibit in Denmark to avoid the commercialism of the North American market.

Ho Ho Ho

Ho Ho Ho, also known as VH-1 Presents RuPaul: Ho Ho Ho, is a 1997 <a href="Christmas%20album">Christmas album</a> and the third studio album by American singer and <a href="drag%20queen">drag queen</a> <a href="RuPaul">RuPaul</a>. Released on October 28, 1997 by the record label <a href="Rhino%20Entertainment">Rhino</a>, it is RuPaul's first album featuring Christmas music and serves as a follow-up to his 1996 album <a href="Foxy%20Lady%20%28RuPaul%20album%29">"Foxy Lady"</a>. RuPaul co-produced the album with <a href="Fenton%20Bailey">Fenton Bailey</a> and <a href="Randy%20Barbato">Randy Barbato</a> from the production company <a href="World%20of%20Wonder%20%28production%20company%29">World of Wonder</a>. "Ho Ho Ho" consists of thirteen tracks, including ten covers of <a href="Christmas%20music%23Popular%20Christmas%20songs">Christmas standards</a> and <a href="Christmas%20carol">carols</a>, and three original songs written by Joe Carrano and RuPaul. <a href="Music%20criticism">Music critics</a> frequently described the album as an example of <a href="Camp%20%28style%29">camp</a> though RuPaul clarified that it included several more serious covers, specifically "<a href="All%20Alone%20on%20Christmas">All Alone on Christmas</a>" and "<a href="Hard%20Candy%20Christmas">Hard Candy Christmas</a>".

"Ho Ho Ho" was praised by critics following its release and during retrospective reviews; its cheerful and humorous compositions were frequently cited as the album's highlights, though some commentators responded negatively to the record's use of humor and the lack of clarity in its overall message. It was included in a 2016 parody list discussing the <a href="alt-right">alt-right</a>, the <a href="Christmas%20controversies">"War on Christmas</a>", and the <a href="bathroom%20bill">bathroom bill</a>. The album peaked at number 27 on the <a href="Heatseekers%20Albums">Heatseekers Albums</a> <a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">"Billboard"</a> chart, selling a little more than 4,000 copies in one week. To support the record, RuPaul filmed a television special as part of his <a href="VH1">VH1</a> talk show "<a href="The%20RuPaul%20Show">The RuPaul Show</a>" (1996).

"Ho Ho Ho" was recorded in <a href="RuPaul">RuPaul</a>s' living room in New York City; it was completed over the span of three days in July 1997. RuPaul attributed the album's success to his chemistry with American singer <a href="Michelle%20Visage">Michelle Visage</a>, saying: "You can hear us having a good time. So whether it was a <a href="Hanukkah">Hanukkah</a> album or a <a href="Kwanzaa">Kwanzaa</a> album, it didn't make a difference, because the chemistry is there." RuPaul and Visage interpreted Christmas songs as examples of <a href="Camp%20%28style%29">camp</a> while describing them as still holding clear messages; RuPaul explained: "Even the camp stuff still holds the true meaning of Christmas, the sweetness and the love about another year gone by." The album's record label <a href="Rhino%20Entertainment">Rhino</a> executive promoted the album through the <a href="tagline">tagline</a>: "Celebrate Christmas with classic holiday songs and camp, RuPaul style!"

"Ho Ho Ho" was made available on October 28, 1997 by Rhino on <a href="Compact%20Cassette">cassette</a> and <a href="Compact%20disc">CD</a>. It was rereleased as a <a href="Digital%20download%20%28music%29">digital download</a> in 2009 through Rhino and <a href="Tommy%20Boy%20Records">Tommy Boy Records</a>. The album was also known as "VH-1 Presents RuPaul: Ho Ho Ho". RuPaul promoted the record by headlining a 1997 Christmas special, entitled "A RuPaul Christmas Special", as a part of his <a href="VH1">VH1</a> talk show "<a href="The%20RuPaul%20Show">The RuPaul Show</a>". The special featured a guest appearance from American band <a href="Nirvana%20%28band%29">Nirvana</a>. RuPaul later released a second <a href="Christmas%20album">Christmas album</a> ("<a href="Slay%20Belles">Slay Belles</a>") in 2015, after he spent years hoping to record one with producer <a href="Lucian%20Piane">Lucian Piane</a>.

The opening track for "Ho Ho Ho" is "<a href="Once%20Upon%20a%20Christmas%20%28Kenny%20Rogers%20and%20Dolly%20Parton%20album%29">With Bells On</a>", a "<a href="disco">disco</a>-influenced <a href="Country%20music">country</a>" interpretation of the <a href="Dolly%20Parton">Dolly Parton</a> and <a href="Kenny%20Rogers">Kenny Rogers</a> song of the same name. Visage is featured on the track, and sings about batteries as her only memorable Christmas present. The second track is RuPaul's re-imagining of "<a href="Rudolph%20the%20Red-Nosed%20Reindeer%20%28song%29">Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer</a>" as "RuPaul, the Red-Nosed Drag Queen". In "<a href="All%20I%20Want%20for%20Christmas%20Is%20My%20Two%20Front%20Teeth">All I Want For Christmas</a>", the singer makes a list of requests for various plastic surgery procedures that he would like to receive for the holiday, including <a href="Cheek%20implantation">cheek implant</a>s, <a href="chin%20implant">chin implant</a>s, and a <a href="buttock%20augmentation">buttock augmentation</a>. He also recorded a cover of "<a href="All%20Alone%20on%20Christmas">All Alone on Christmas</a>", calling it his favorite Christmas song; he clarified that he wanted to do a serious interpretation of the track.

RuPaul's covers of "<a href="I%20Saw%20Mommy%20Kissing%20Santa%20Claus">I Saw Daddy Kissing Santa Claus</a>" and "<a href="Hard%20Candy%20Christmas">Hard Candy Christmas</a>" were noted for their use of camp. He identified "Hard Candy Christmas" as one of the "serious ones" on the album, and said it was only considered camp due to "the fact that [he was] doing it". When recording the song, Visage was unfamiliar with its source "<a href="The%20Best%20Little%20Whorehouse%20in%20Texas">The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas</a>", and sang it according to RuPaul's direction. <a href="Carol%20Hall">Carol Hall</a>, who had written the song, had described RuPaul's cover as her favorite version, and ranked it above Dolly Parton's interpretation. The album also includes a cover of "<a href="You%27re%20a%20Mean%20One%2C%20Mr.%20Grinch">You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch</a>", incorporating elements from <a href="funk">funk</a>, and "Christmas Train (Medley)", serving as a <a href="Electronic%20dance%20music">club</a> remix of various Christmas songs. The final track is a remix of the song "Celebrate"; the original version had previously appeared on RuPaul's second album <a href="Foxy%20Lady%20%28RuPaul%20album%29">"Foxy Lady"</a> (1996).

Upon its release, "Ho Ho Ho" received primarily positive reviews from <a href="Music%20criticism">music critics</a>. <a href="Vibe%20%28magazine%29">"Vibe"</a>'s Shawnee Smith described the album as a "collection of reinterpretations guaranteed to lift your spirits", and commended it for its up-tempo instrumentals and ability to reverse "holiday depression". While highlighting the changes made to the songs' titles, Ken Veeder of "<a href="The%20Advocate%20%28LGBT%20magazine%29">The Advocate</a>" positively responded to RuPaul's interpretations of the Christmas classic in "the gay way". Veeder pointed to "I Saw Daddy Kissing Santa Claus" as his favorite track. "<a href="E%21%20News">E! News</a>"' Joal Ryan noted that the album was one of the most boundary-pushing Christmas releases of the year. <a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">"Billboard"</a>'s Melinda Newman considered the album a <a href="Novelty%20song">novelty record</a>, praising it as a more humorous example of the genre.

"Ho Ho Ho" has also been the subject of praise from several retrospective reviews. During a 2015 interview with the "<a href="Gay%20Times">Gay Times</a>", RuPaul and Visage stated that "Ho Ho Ho" had become a "classic Christmas traditional album" alongside releases by American singers <a href="Johnny%20Mathis">Johnny Mathis</a> and <a href="Barbra%20Streisand">Barbra Streisand</a>. In a 2015 article, <a href="Idolator%20%28website%29">Idolator</a>'s Robbie Daw described it as a "yuletide classic". The same year, Darren Scott of the "Gay Times" praised it as one of his favorite Christmas albums of all time, and a writer from <a href="OutTV%20%28Canada%29">OutTV</a> referred to it as a "collection of cheeky and cheerful tunes". On the other hand, in a 2017 article, <a href="Junkee">Junkee</a>'s Bel Ryan felt that the album had "for the most part, fallen into the mighty chasm of obscurity".

In a 2016 retrospective review, Serene Dominic of "<a href="Tucson%20Weekly">Tucson Weekly</a>" jokingly included RuPaul as part of its list of artists who should not have released a Christmas album for "Ho Ho Ho". The article was written as a parody of the <a href="alt-right">alt-right</a> and the <a href="Christmas%20controversies">"War on Christmas</a>", Dominic joking that the album led to the creation of the <a href="bathroom%20bill">bathroom bill</a>s.

Some critics have negatively responded to RuPaul's use of humor in "Ho Ho Ho". "<a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>"'s Thomas Erlewine criticized RuPaul's reliance on camp in the album, writing that it was "tired, predictable, and simply not funny" and that it was a "sad display from an entertainer who used to be hip, clever, and very funny". Newman questioned the effectiveness of the record's overall message, noting that RuPaul's message in the liner notes about "creating one's own family for the holidays" did not fit with the image of "Ru's Christmas panties around his ankles". While she responded positively to a majority of the songs, Newman viewed "You're A Mean One, Mr. Grinch" as an unsuccessful cover. In an interview with "<a href="Queerty">Queerty</a>", American drag queen <a href="Hedda%20Lettuce">Hedda Lettuce</a> revealed that RuPaul's cover of "Hard Candy Christmas" was her least favorite Christmas song of all time; Lettuce said that the song "makes [him] want to shove a candy cane in [his] eye".

In the United States, "Ho Ho Ho" reached a peak position of number 27 on the <a href="Heatseekers%20Albums">Heatseekers Albums</a> <a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">"Billboard"</a> chart, and remained on the chart for two weeks. It sold a little more than 4,000 copies in one week. The remix of "Celebrate" peaked at number 31 on "<a href="Billboard%20Magazine">Billboard</a>" <a href="Dance%20Club%20Songs">Dance Club Songs</a> chart on October 11, 1997 and remained on the chart for a total of seven weeks.

Ankylosaurus

Ankylosaurus is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="Thyreophora">armored dinosaur</a>. Its <a href="fossil">fossil</a>s have been found in <a href="geological%20formation">geological formation</a>s dating to the very end of the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> <a href="Period%20%28geology%29">Period</a>, about 68–66 million years ago, in western North America, making it among the last of the non-avian <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s. It was named by <a href="Barnum%20Brown">Barnum Brown</a> in 1908; the only species in the genus is A. magniventris. The genus name means "fused lizard", and the specific name means "great belly". A handful of specimens have been excavated to date, but a complete skeleton has not been discovered. Though other members of Ankylosauria are represented by more extensive fossil material, "Ankylosaurus" is often considered the <a href="archetype">archetypal</a> member of its group, despite having some unusual features.

Possibly the largest-known <a href="Ankylosauridae">ankylosaurid</a>, "Ankylosaurus" is estimated to have been between long and to have weighed between . It was <a href="Quadrupedalism">quadrupedal</a>, with a broad, robust body. It had a wide, low skull, with two horns pointing backward from the back of the head, and two horns below these that pointed backward and down. Unlike other ankylosaurs, its nostrils faced sideways rather than towards the front. The front part of the jaws was covered in a beak, with rows of small, leaf-shaped teeth farther behind it. It was covered in armor plates, or <a href="osteoderm">osteoderm</a>s, with bony half-rings covering the neck, and had a large club on the end of its tail. Bones in the skull and other parts of the body were fused, increasing their strength, and this feature is the source of the genus name.

"Ankylosaurus" is a member of the family Ankylosauridae, and its closest relatives appear to be "<a href="Anodontosaurus">Anodontosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Euoplocephalus">Euoplocephalus</a>". "Ankylosaurus" is thought to have been a slow-moving animal, able to make quick movements when necessary. Its broad muzzle indicates it was a non-selective <a href="Browsing%20%28herbivory%29">browser</a>. <a href="Paranasal%20sinuses">Sinuses</a> and nasal chambers in the snout may have been for heat and water balance or may have played a role in vocalization. The tail club is thought to have been used in defense against predators or in <a href="Intraspecific%20competition">intraspecific combat</a>. "Ankylosaurus" has been found in the <a href="Hell%20Creek%20Formation">Hell Creek</a>, <a href="Lance%20Formation">Lance</a>, <a href="Scollard%20Formation">Scollard</a>, <a href="Frenchman%20Formation">Frenchman</a>, and <a href="Ferris%20Formation">Ferris</a> formations, but appears to have been rare in its environment. Although it lived alongside a <a href="Nodosauridae">nodosaurid</a> ankylosaur, their ranges and <a href="ecological%20niche">ecological niche</a>s do not appear to have overlapped, and "Ankylosaurus" may have inhabited upland areas. "Ankylosaurus" also lived alongside dinosaurs such as "<a href="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus</a>", "<a href="Triceratops">Triceratops</a>", and "<a href="Edmontosaurus">Edmontosaurus</a>".

"Ankylosaurus" was the largest-known <a href="Ankylosauridae">ankylosaurine</a> dinosaur and possibly the largest <a href="Ankylosauridae">ankylosaurid</a>. In 2004 the American <a href="Paleontology">paleontologist</a> <a href="Kenneth%20Carpenter">Kenneth Carpenter</a> estimated that the individual with the largest-known skull (specimen <a href="Canadian%20Museum%20of%20Nature">CMN</a> 8880), which is long and wide, was about long and had a hip height of about . The smallest-known skull (specimen <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">AMNH</a> 5214) is long and wide, and Carpenter estimated that it measured about long and about tall at the hips. In 2017, based on comparisons with more complete ankylosaurines, the Canadian paleontologists <a href="Victoria%20Arbour">Victoria Arbour</a> and Jordan Mallon estimated a length of for CMN 8880 and for AMNH 5214. Though the latter is the smallest specimen of "Ankylosaurus", its skull is still larger than those of any other ankylosaurins. A few other <a href="Ankylosauria">ankylosaurs</a> reached about in length. Because the vertebrae of AMNH 5214 are not significantly larger than those of other ankylosaurines, Arbour and Mallon considered their upper range estimate of nearly for large "Ankylosaurus" too long, and suggested a length of instead. Arbour and Mallon estimated a weight of for AMNH 5214 and tentatively estimated the weight of CMN 8880 at . Benson and colleagues also estimated the weight for the animal of AMNH 5214 at in 2014. 

The structure of much of the skeleton of "Ankylosaurus", including most of the <a href="pelvis">pelvis</a>, tail, and feet, is still unknown. It was <a href="quadruped">quadruped</a>al, and its hind limbs were longer than its forelimbs. In specimen AMNH 5895, the <a href="scapula">scapula</a> (shoulder blade) measures long and was fused with the <a href="coracoid">coracoid</a> (a rectangular bone connected to the lower end of the scapula). It also had <a href="Enthesis">entheses</a> (connective tissue) for various muscle attachments. The <a href="humerus">humerus</a> (upper arm bone) of AMNH 5214 was short, very broad and about long. The <a href="femur">femur</a> (thigh bone), also from AMNH 5214, was long and very robust. While the feet of "Ankylosaurus" are incompletely known, the hindfeet probably had three toes, as is the case in advanced ankylosaurids.

The <a href="cervical%20vertebrae">cervical vertebrae</a> of the neck had broad neural spines that increased in height towards the body. The front part of the neural spines had well-developed <a href="entheses">entheses</a>, which was common among adult dinosaurs, and indicates the presence of large <a href="ligament">ligament</a>s, which helped support the massive head. The <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location">dorsal</a> <a href="vertebra">vertebra</a>e of the back had centra (or bodies) that were short relative to their width, and their neural spines were short and narrow. The dorsal vertebrae were tightly spaced, which limited the downwards movement of the back. The neural spines had <a href="Ossification">ossified</a> (turned to bone) <a href="tendon">tendon</a>s, which also overlapped some of the vertebrae. The ribs of the last four back vertebrae were fused to them, and the <a href="ribcage">ribcage</a> was very broad in this part of the body. The ribs had scars that show where muscles attached to them. The caudal vertebrae of the tail had centra that were slightly amphicoelous, meaning they were concave on both sides.

The three known "Ankylosaurus" skulls differ in various details; this is thought to be the result of <a href="taphonomy">taphonomy</a> (changes happening during decay and fossilization of the remains) and <a href="Polymorphism%20%28biology%29">individual variation</a>. The skull was low and triangular in shape, and wider than it was long; the back of the skull was broad and low. The skull had a broad <a href="beak">beak</a> on the <a href="premaxilla">premaxilla</a>e. The <a href="orbit%20%28anatomy%29">orbit</a>s (eye sockets) were almost round to slightly oval and did not face directly sideways because the skull tapered towards the front. The braincase was short and robust, as in other ankylosaurines. Crests above the orbits merged into the upper <a href="Squamosal%20bone">squamosal</a> horns (their shape has been described as "<a href="pyramid">pyramid</a>al"), which pointed backwards to the sides from the back of the skull. The crest and horn were probably separate elements originally, as seen in the related "<a href="Pinacosaurus">Pinacosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Euoplocephalus">Euoplocephalus</a>". Below the upper horns, <a href="Jugal%20bone">jugal</a> horns were present, which pointed backward and down. The horns may have originally been <a href="osteoderms">osteoderms</a> (armor plates) that fused to the skull. The <a href="Scale%20%28anatomy%29">scale</a>-like pattern on the skull surface (called "caputegulae" in ankylosaurs) was the result of <a href="Bone%20remodeling">remodeling</a> of the skull itself. This obliterated the <a href="Suture%20%28anatomy%29">sutures</a> between skull elements, which is common for adult ankylosaurs. The scale pattern of the skull was variable between specimens, though some details are shared. "Ankylosaurus" had a diamond-shaped (or hexagonal) <a href="Rostral%20scale">internarial scale</a> at the front of the snout between the nostrils, two squamosal osteoderms above the orbit, and a ridge of scales at the back of the skull.

The snout region of "Ankylosaurus" was unique among ankylosaurs, and had undergone an "extreme" transformation compared to its relatives. The snout was arched and truncated at the front, and the nostrils were elliptical and were directed downward and outward, unlike in all other known ankylosaurids where they faced obliquely forward or upward. Additionally, the nostrils were not visible from the front because the <a href="sinuses">sinuses</a> were expanded to the sides of the premaxilla bone, to a larger extent than seen in other ankylosaurs. Large loreal caputegulae—strap-like, side osteoderms of the snout—completely roofed the enlarged opening of the nostrils, giving a bulbous appearance. The nostrils also had an intranarial <a href="Nasal%20septum">septum</a>, which separated the nasal passage from the sinus. Each side of the snout had five sinuses, four of which expanded into the <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a> bone. The nasal cavities (or chambers) of "Ankylosaurus" were elongated and separated by a septum at the midline, which divided the inside of the snout into two mirrored halves. The septum had two openings, including the <a href="Posterior%20nasal%20apertures">choanae</a> (internal nostrils).

The maxillae expanded to the sides, giving the impression of a bulge, which may have been due to the sinuses inside. The maxillae had a ridge that may have been the attachment site for fleshy cheeks; the presence of cheeks in ornithischians is controversial, but some <a href="nodosaurid">nodosaurid</a> ankylosaurs had armor plates that covered the cheek region, which may have been embedded in the flesh. Specimen AMNH 5214 has 34–35 <a href="Dental%20alveolus">dental alveoli</a> (tooth sockets) in the maxilla and has more teeth than any other known ankylosaurid. The tooth rows in the maxillae of this specimen are about long. Each alveolus had a <a href="foramen">foramen</a> (opening) near its side where a <a href="Polyphyodont">replacement tooth</a> could be seen.

Compared to other ankylosaurs, the <a href="mandible">mandible</a> of "Ankylosaurus" was low in proportion to its length, and, when seen from the side, the tooth row was almost straight instead of arched. The mandibles are completely preserved only in the smallest specimen (AMNH 5214) and are about long. The incomplete mandible of the largest specimen (CMN 8880) is the same length. AMNH 5214 has 35 dental alveoli in the left <a href="Mandible">dentary</a> and 36 in the right, for a total of 71, the highest number known for any ankylosaurid. The <a href="predentary">predentary</a> bone of the tip of the mandibles has not yet been found. The tooth row was relatively short. Like other ankylosaurs, "Ankylosaurus" had small, phylliform (leaf-shaped) teeth, which were compressed sideways. The teeth were mostly taller than they were wide, and were very small; their size in proportion to the skull meant that the jaws could accommodate more teeth than other ankylosaurines. The teeth of the largest "Ankylosaurus" skull are smaller than those of the smallest skull in the absolute sense. Some teeth from behind in the tooth row curved backwards, and <a href="Crown%20%28tooth%29">tooth crowns</a> were usually flatter on one side than the other. "Ankylosaurus" teeth are <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29%23Taxonomic%20descriptions">diagnostic</a> and can be distinguished from the teeth of other ankylosaurids based on their smooth sides. The <a href="Denticle%20%28tooth%20feature%29">denticles</a> were large, their number ranging from six to eight on the front part of the tooth, and five to seven behind.

A prominent feature of "Ankylosaurus" was its armor, consisting of knobs and plates of bone known as osteoderms, or scutes, embedded in the skin. These have not been found in articulation, so their exact placement on the body is unknown, though inferences can be made based on related animals, and various configurations have been proposed. The osteoderms ranged from in diameter to in length, and varied in shape. The osteoderms of "Ankylosaurus" were generally thin walled and hollowed on the underside. Compared to "Euoplocephalus", the osteoderms of "Ankylosaurus" were smoother. Small osteoderms and ossicles probably occupied the space between the larger ones. The osteoderms covering the body were very flat, though with a low keel at one margin. In contrast, the nodosaurid "<a href="Edmontonia">Edmontonia</a>" had high keels stretching from one margin to the other on the midline of its osteoderms. "Ankylosaurus" had some smaller osteoderms with a keel across the midline. 

Like other ankylosaurids, "Ankylosaurus" had cervical half-rings (armor plates on the neck), but these are known only from fragments, making their exact arrangement uncertain. Carpenter suggested that when seen from above, the plates would have been paired, creating an inverted V-shape across the neck, with the midline gap probably being filled with small ossicles (round bony scutes) to allow for movement. He believed the width of this armor belt was too wide to have fitted solely on the neck, and that it covered the base of the neck and continued onto the shoulder region. Arbour and <a href="Philip%20J.%20Currie">Philip J. Currie</a> disagreed with Carpenter's interpretation in 2015 and pointed out that the cervical half-ring fragments of specimen AMNH 5895 did not fit together in the way proposed by Carpenter (though this could be due to breakage). They instead suggested that the fragments represented the remains of two cervical half-rings, which formed two semi-circular plates of armor around the upper part of the neck, as in the closely related "<a href="Anodontosaurus">Anodontosaurus</a>" and "Euoplocephalus". Arbour and Mallon elaborated on this idea, describing the shape of these half-rings as "continuous U-shaped yokes" over the upper part of the neck, and suggested that "Ankylosaurus" had six keeled osteoderms with oval bases on each half-ring. Other ankylosaurids often have many smaller osteoderms surrounding these larger ones.

The first osteoderms behind the second cervical half-ring would have been similar in shape to those in the half-ring, and the osteoderms on the back probably decreased in diameter hindwards. The largest osteoderms were probably arranged in transverse and longitudinal rows across most of the body, with four or five transverse rows separated by creases in the skin. The osteoderms on the flanks would probably have had a more square outline than those on the back. There may have been four longitudinal rows of osteoderms on the flanks. Unlike some basal ankylosaurs and many nodosaurs, ankylosaurids do not appear to have had co-ossified pelvic shields above their hips. Some osteoderms without keels may have been placed above the hip region of "Ankylosaurus", as in "Euoplocephalus". "Ankylosaurus" may have had three or four transverse rows of circular osteoderms over the pelvic region, which were smaller than those on the rest of the body, as in "<a href="Scolosaurus">Scolosaurus</a>". Smaller, triangular osteoderms may have been present on the sides of the pelvis. Flattened, pointed plates resemble those on the sides of the tail of "Saichania". Osteoderms with oval keels could have been placed on the upper side of the tail or the side of the limbs. Compressed, triangular osteoderms found with "Ankylosaurus" specimens may have been placed on the sides of the pelvis or the tail. Ovoid, keeled, and teardrop-shaped osteoderms are known from "Ankylosaurus", and may have been placed on the forelimbs, like those known from "Pinacosaurus", but it is unknown whether the hindlimbs bore osteoderms. 

The tail club (or tail knob) of "Ankylosaurus" was composed of two large osteoderms, with a row of small osteoderms at the midline, and two small osteoderms at the tip; these osteoderms obscured the last tail vertebra. As only the tail club of specimen AMNH 5214 is known, the range of variation between individuals is unknown. The tail club of AMNH 5214 is long, wide, and tall. The club of the largest specimen may have been wide. The tail club of "Ankylosaurus" was semicircular when seen from above, similar to those of "Euoplocephalus" and "Scolosaurus" but unlike the pointed club osteoderms of "Anodontosaurus" or the narrow, elongated club of "Dyoplosaurus". The last seven tail vertebrae formed the "handle" of the tail club. These vertebrae were in contact, with no cartilage between them, and were sometimes co-ossified, which made them immobile. Ossified tendons attached to the vertebrae in front of the tail club, and these features together helped strengthen it. The interlocked <a href="Articular%20processes">zygapophyses</a> (articular processes) and neural spines of the handle vertebrae were U-shaped when seen from above, whereas those of most other ankylosaurids are V-shaped, which may be due to the handle of "Ankylosaurus" being wider. The larger width may indicate that the tail of "Ankylosaurus" was shorter in relation to its body length than those of other ankylosaurids, or that it had the same proportions but with a smaller club.

In 1906, an <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a> expedition led by <a href="Paleontology">paleontologist</a> <a href="Barnum%20Brown">Barnum Brown</a> discovered the <a href="Type%20%28biology%29%23Type%20specimen">type specimen</a> of "Ankylosaurus magniventris" (AMNH 5895) in the <a href="Hell%20Creek%20Formation">Hell Creek Formation</a>, near Gilbert Creek, <a href="Montana">Montana</a>. The specimen (found by collector Peter Kaisen) consisted of the upper part of a skull, two teeth, part of the shoulder girdle, cervical, dorsal, and caudal vertebrae, ribs, and more than thirty osteoderms. Brown scientifically <a href="species%20description">described</a> the animal in 1908; the <a href="genus">genus</a> name is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> words /"ankulos" ('bent' or 'crooked'), referring to the medical term <a href="ankylosis">ankylosis</a>, the stiffness produced by the fusion of bones in the skull and body, and /"sauros" ('lizard'). The name can be translated as "fused lizard", "stiff lizard", or "curved lizard". The <a href="type%20species">type species</a> name "magniventris" is derived from the ('great') and ('belly'), referring to the great width of the animal's body.

The skeletal reconstruction accompanying the 1908 description restored the missing parts in a fashion similar to "<a href="Stegosaurus">Stegosaurus</a>", and Brown likened the result to the extinct armored mammal "<a href="Glyptodon">Glyptodon</a>". In contrast to modern depictions, Brown's stegosaur-like reconstruction showed robust forelimbs, a strongly arched back, a pelvis with prongs projecting forwards from the ilium and pubis, as well as a short, drooping tail without a tail club, which was unknown at the time. Brown also reconstructed the armor plates in parallel rows running down the back; this arrangement was purely hypothetical. Brown's reconstruction became highly influential, and restorations of the animal based on his diagram were published as late as the 1980s. In a 1908 review of Brown's "Ankylosaurus" description, American paleontologist <a href="Samuel%20Wendell%20Williston">Samuel Wendell Williston</a> criticised the skeletal reconstruction as being based on too few remains, and claimed that "Ankylosaurus" was merely a synonym of the genus "<a href="Stegopelta">Stegopelta</a>", which Williston had named in 1905. Williston also stated that a skeletal reconstruction of the related "<a href="Polacanthus">Polacanthus</a>" by <a href="Hungarians">Hungarian</a> paleontologist <a href="Franz%20Nopcsa%20von%20Fels%C5%91-Szilv%C3%A1s">Franz Nopcsa</a> was a better example of how ankylosaurs would have appeared in life. The claim of synonymy was not accepted by other researchers, and the two genera are now considered distinct.

Brown had collected 77 osteoderms while excavating a "<a href="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus</a>" specimen in the <a href="Lance%20Formation">Lance Formation</a> of Wyoming in 1900. He mentioned these osteoderms (specimen AMNH 5866) in his description of "Ankylosaurus" but thought they belonged to the "Tyrannosaurus" instead. Paleontologist <a href="Henry%20Fairfield%20Osborn">Henry Fairfield Osborn</a> also expressed this view when he described the "Tyrannosaurus" specimen as the now invalid genus "Dynamosaurus" in 1905. More recent examination has shown them to be similar to those of "Ankylosaurus"; it seems that Brown had compared them with some "Euoplocephalus" osteoderms, which had been erroneously cataloged as belonging to "Ankylosaurus" at the AMNH.

In 1910 another AMNH expedition led by Brown discovered an "Ankylosaurus" specimen (AMNH 5214) in the <a href="Scollard%20Formation">Scollard Formation</a> by the <a href="Red%20Deer%20River">Red Deer River</a> in Alberta, Canada. This specimen included a complete skull, mandibles, the first and only tail club known of this genus, as well as ribs, vertebrae, limb bones, and armor. In 1947 <a href="Fossil%20collecting">fossil collectors</a> <a href="Charles%20Mortram%20Sternberg">Charles M. Sternberg</a> and T. Potter Chamney collected a skull and mandible (specimen CMN 8880, formerly NMC 8880), a kilometer (0.6 mile) north of where the 1910 specimen was found. This is the largest-known "Ankylosaurus" skull, but it is damaged in places. A section of caudal vertebrae (specimen CCM V03) was discovered in the 1960s in the <a href="Powder%20River%20%28Wyoming%20and%20Montana%29">Powder River</a> drainage, Montana, part of the Hell Creek Formation. In addition to these five incomplete specimens, many other isolated osteoderms and teeth have been found.

In 1990 American paleontologist <a href="Walter%20P.%20Coombs">Walter P. Coombs</a> pointed out that the teeth of two skulls assigned to "A. magniventris" differed from those of the holotype specimen in some details, and though he expressed a "considerate temptation" to name a new species of "Ankylosaurus" for these, he refrained from doing so, as the range of variation in the species was not completely documented. He also raised the possibility that the two teeth associated with the holotype specimen perhaps did not belong to it, as they were found in <a href="Matrix%20%28geology%29">matrix</a> within the nasal chambers. Carpenter accepted the teeth as belonging to "A. magniventris", and that all the specimens belonged to the same species, noting that the teeth of other ankylosaurs are highly variable.

Most of the known "Ankylosaurus" specimens were not scientifically described at length, though several paleontologists planned to do so until Carpenter redescribed the genus in 2004. Carpenter noted that "Ankylosaurus" has become the <a href="Archetype">archetypal</a> member of its group, and the best-known ankylosaur in <a href="popular%20culture">popular culture</a>, perhaps due to a life-sized reconstruction of the animal being featured at the <a href="1964%20New%20York%20World%27s%20Fair">1964 World's Fair</a> in New York City. That sculpture, as well as the American artist <a href="Rudolph%20Zallinger">Rudolph Zallinger</a>'s 1947 mural "<a href="The%20Age%20of%20Reptiles">The Age of Reptiles</a>" and other later popular depictions, showed "Ankylosaurus" with a tail club, following the first discovery of this feature in 1910. In spite of its familiarity, it is known from far fewer remains than its closest relatives. In 2017 Arbour and Mallon redescribed the genus in light of newer ankylosaur discoveries, including elements of the holotype that had not been previously mentioned in the literature (such as parts of the skull and the cervical half-rings). They concluded that though "Ankylosaurus" is iconic and the best-known member of its group, it was bizarre in comparison to related ankylosaurs, and therefore not representative of the group.

Many traditional popular depictions show "Ankylosaurus" in a squatting posture and with a huge tail club being dragged over the ground. Modern reconstructions show the animal with a more upright limb posture and with the tail held off the ground. Likewise, large spines projecting sideways from the body (similar to those of nodosaurs) are present in many traditional depictions, but are not known from "Ankylosaurus" itself. The armor of "Ankylosaurus" has often been conflated with that of "Edmontonia" (earlier referred to as "<a href="Palaeoscincus">Palaeoscincus</a>"); in addition to "Ankylosaurus" being depicted with spikes, "Edmontonia" has also been depicted with an "Ankylosaurus"-like tail club (a feature nodosaurids did not have), including in a mural by the American artist <a href="Charles%20R.%20Knight">Charles R. Knight</a> from 1930.

Brown considered "Ankylosaurus" so distinct that he made it the <a href="Type%20%28biology%29">type genus</a> of a new <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a>, <a href="Ankylosauridae">Ankylosauridae</a>, typified by massive, triangular skulls, short necks, stiff backs, broad bodies, and osteoderms. He also classified "Palaeoscincus" (only known from teeth), and "Euoplocephalus" (then only known from a partial skull and osteoderms) as part of the family. Due to the fragmentary condition of the remains, Brown was unable to fully distinguish between "Euoplocephalus" and "Ankylosaurus". Having for comparison only a few, incomplete members of the family, he believed the group was part of the <a href="Order%20%28biology%29">suborder</a> <a href="Stegosauria">Stegosauria</a>. In 1923 Osborn coined the name <a href="Ankylosauria">Ankylosauria</a>, thereby placing the ankylosaurids in their own suborder.

Ankylosauria and Stegosauria are now grouped together within the clade <a href="Thyreophora">Thyreophora</a>. This group first appeared in the <a href="Sinemurian">Sinemurian</a> age, and survived for 135 million years until disappearing in the <a href="Maastrichtian">Maastrichtian</a>. They were widespread and inhabited a broad range of environments. As more complete specimens and new genera have been discovered, theories about ankylosaurian interrelatedness have become more complex, and hypotheses have often changed between studies. In addition to Ankylosauridae, Ankylosauria has been divided into the families Nodosauridae, and sometimes <a href="Polacanthinae">Polacanthidae</a> (these families lacked tail clubs). "Ankylosaurus" is considered part of the <a href="subfamily">subfamily</a> <a href="Ankylosaurinae">Ankylosaurinae</a> (members of which are called ankylosaurines) within Ankylosauridae. "Ankylosaurus" appears to be most closely related to "Anodontosaurus" and "Euoplocephalus". The following <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> is based on a 2015 <a href="Phylogenetics">phylogenetic analysis</a> of the Ankylosaurinae conducted by Arbour and Currie:

Since "Ankylosaurus" and other Late Cretaceous North American ankylosaurids grouped with Asian genera (in a <a href="Tribe%20%28biology%29">tribe</a> the authors named <a href="Ankylosaurini">Ankylosaurini</a>), Arbour and Currie suggested that earlier North American ankylosaurids had gone extinct by the late <a href="Albian">Albian</a> or <a href="Cenomanian">Cenomanian</a> ages of the Middle <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>. Ankylosaurids thereafter recolonized North America from Asia during the <a href="Campanian">Campanian</a> or <a href="Turonian">Turonian</a> ages of the Late Cretaceous, and there <a href="Phylogenetic%20diversity">diversified</a> again, leading to genera such as "Ankylosaurus", "Anodontosaurus", and "Euoplocephalus". This explains a 30-million-year gap in the <a href="fossil">fossil</a> record of North American ankylosaurids between these ages.

Like other <a href="ornithischia">ornithischia</a>ns, "Ankylosaurus" was <a href="Herbivore">herbivorous</a>. Its wide muzzle was adapted for non-selective low-<a href="Browsing%20%28herbivory%29">browse</a> cropping, although not to the extent seen in some related genera, especially "Euoplocephalus". Though ankylosaurs may not have fed on <a href="Fiber">fibrous</a> and <a href="woody%20plant">woody plant</a>s, they may have had a varied diet, including tough leaves and pulpy fruits. "Ankylosaurus" probably fed on abundant <a href="fern">fern</a>s and low-growing <a href="shrub">shrub</a>s. Assuming it was <a href="endotherm">endotherm</a>ic, "Ankylosaurus" would have eaten of ferns per day, similar to the amount of dry vegetation a large <a href="elephant">elephant</a> would consume. The requirements for nutrition could have been more effectively met if "Ankylosaurus" ate fruit, which its small, cusp-like teeth and the shape of its beak seem well adapted for, compared to for example "Euoplocephalus". Certain invertebrates, which the small teeth may have been adapted for handling, could also have provided supplemental nutrition.

Fossils of "Ankylosaurus" teeth exhibit wear on the face of the crown rather than on the tip of the crown, as in nodosaurid ankylosaurs. In 1982 Carpenter ascribed to baby "Ankylosaurus" two very small teeth that originate from the Lance and Hell Creek Formations and measure in length, respectively. The smaller tooth is heavily worn, leading Carpenter to suggest that ankylosaurids in general or at least the young did not swallow their food whole but employed some sort of chewing. Since adult "Ankylosaurus" did little chewing of its food, it would have spent less time in the day foraging than an elephant. Based on the broadness of the ribcage, the digestion of unchewed food may have been facilitated by <a href="hindgut%20fermentation">hindgut fermentation</a> like in modern herbivorous lizards, which have several chambers in their enlarged <a href="Large%20intestine">colon</a>.
In 1969 Austrian paleontologist <a href="Georg%20Haas%20%28paleontologist%29">Georg Haas</a> concluded that despite the large size of ankylosaur skulls, the associated musculature was relatively weak. He also thought jaw movement was limited to up and down movements. Extrapolating from this, Haas suggested that ankylosaurs ate relatively soft non-abrasive vegetation. Later research on "Euoplocephalus" indicates that forward and sideways jaw movement was possible in these animals, the skull being able to withstand considerable forces. A 2016 study of the <a href="Occlusion%20%28dentistry%29">dental occlusion</a> (contact between the teeth) of ankylosaur specimens found that the ability for backwards (palinal) jaw movement <a href="convergent%20evolution">evolved independently</a> in different ankylosaur <a href="Lineage%20%28evolution%29">lineages</a>, including Late Cretaceous North American ankylosaurids like "Ankylosaurus" and "Euoplocephalus".

A specimen of the ankylosaur "Pinacosaurus" preserves large paraglossalia (triangular bones or cartilages located in the tongue) that show signs of muscular stress, and it is thought this was a common feature of ankylosaurs. The researchers who examined the specimen suggested that ankylosaurs relied heavily on muscular tongues and hyobranchia (tongue bones) when feeding since their teeth were fairly small and were replaced at a relatively slow rate. Some modern <a href="salamander">salamander</a>s have similar tongue bones, and use <a href="Prehensility">prehensile</a> tongues to pick up food. The retracted position of the nostrils of "Ankylosaurus" have been compared to those of <a href="fossorial">fossorial</a> (digging) <a href="Amphisbaenia">worm lizards</a> and <a href="Scolecophidia">blind snakes</a>, and though it was probably not a burrowing animal, the snout of "Ankylosaurus" may indicate earth-moving behavior. These factors, as well as the low rate of tooth formation in ankylosaurs compared to other ornithischians, indicate that "Ankylosaurus" may have been <a href="Omnivore">omnivorous</a> (eating both plant and animal matter). It may also (or alternatively) have dug in the ground for roots and <a href="tuber">tuber</a>s.

In 1977 Polish paleontologist <a href="Teresa%20Marya%C5%84ska">Teresa Maryańska</a> proposed that the complex sinuses and nasal cavities of ankylosaurs may have lightened the weight of the skull, housed a nasal <a href="gland">gland</a>, or acted as a chamber for <a href="Vocal%20resonation">vocal resonance</a>. Carpenter rejected these hypotheses, arguing that <a href="tetrapod">tetrapod</a> animals make sounds through the <a href="larynx">larynx</a>, not the nostrils, and that reduction in weight was minimal, as the spaces only accounted for a small percent of the skull volume. He also considered a gland unlikely and noted that the sinuses may not have had any specific function. It has also been suggested that the respiratory passages were used to perform a mammal-like treatment of inhaled air, based on the presence and arrangement of <a href="nasal%20concha">specialized bones</a>.

A 2011 study of the nasal passages of "Euoplocephalus" supported their function as a heat and water balancing system, noting the extensive blood vessel system and an increased surface area for the <a href="Mucous%20membrane%20of%20nose">mucosa membrane</a> (used for heat and water exchange in modern animals). The researchers also supported the idea of the loops acting as a resonance chamber, comparable to the elongated nasal passages of <a href="saiga%20antelope">saiga antelope</a> and the looping trachea of <a href="Crane%20%28bird%29">crane</a>s and <a href="swan">swan</a>s. Reconstructions of the inner ear suggest adaptation to hearing at low frequencies, such as the low-toned resonant sounds possibly produced by the nasal passages. They disputed the possibility that the looping is related to <a href="olfaction">olfaction</a> (sense of smell) as the olfactory region is pushed to the sides of the main airway.

The shape of the nasal chambers of "Ankylosaurus" indicate that airflow was unidirectional (looping through the lungs during inhalation and exhalation), although it may also have been bidirectional in the posterior nasal chamber, with air directed past the <a href="Olfactory%20bulb">olfactory lobes</a>. The enlarged olfactory region of ankylosaurids indicates a well-developed sense of smell, and the position of the orbits of "Ankylosaurus" suggest some <a href="Stereopsis">stereoscopic vision</a>. Though hindwards retraction of the nostrils is seen in aquatic animals and animals with a <a href="proboscis">proboscis</a>, it is unlikely either possibility applies to "Ankylosaurus", as the nostrils tend to be reduced or the premaxilla extended. In addition, though the widely separated nostrils may have allowed for stereo-olfaction (where each nostril senses smells from different directions), as has been proposed for the <a href="moose">moose</a>, little is known about this feature.

Reconstructions of ankylosaur forelimb musculature made by Coombs in 1978 suggest that the forelimbs bore the majority of the animal's weight, and were adapted for high force delivery on the front feet, possibly for food gathering. In addition, Coombs suggested that ankylosaurs may have been capable diggers, though the hoof-like structure of the <a href="Manus%20%28anatomy%29">manus</a> would have limited fossorial activity. Ankylosaurs were likely to have been slow-moving and sluggish animals, though they may have been capable of quick movements when necessary.

The squamosal horns of the largest "Ankylosaurus" specimen are blunter than those of the smallest specimen, which is also the case in "Euoplocephalus", and this may represent <a href="ontogeny">ontogenetic</a> variation (related to growth development). Studies of specimens of "Pinacosaurus" of different ages found that during ontogenetic development, the ribs of juvenile ankylosaurs fused with their vertebrae. The forelimbs strongly increased in robustness while the hindlimbs did not become larger relative to the rest of the skeleton, further evidence that the arms bore most of the weight. In the cervical half-rings, the underlying bone band developed outgrowths connecting it with the underlying osteoderms, which simultaneously fused to each other. On the skull, the middle bone plates first ossified at the snout and the rear rim, with ossification gradually extending towards the middle regions. On the rest of the body, ossification progressed from the neck backward in the direction of the tail.

The osteoderms of ankylosaurids were thin in comparison to those of other ankylosaurs, and appear to have been strengthened by randomly distributed cushions of <a href="collagen">collagen</a> fibers. Structurally similar to <a href="Sharpey%27s%20fibres">Sharpey's fibres</a>, they were embedded directly into the bone tissue, a feature unique to ankylosaurids. This would have provided the ankylosaurids with an armor covering that was both lightweight and highly durable, being resistant to breakage and penetration by the teeth of predators. The <a href="Palpebral%20%28bone%29">palpebral bones</a> over the eyes may have provided additional protection for them. Carpenter suggested in 1982 that the heavily vascularized armor may also have had a role in <a href="thermoregulation">thermoregulation</a> as in modern <a href="crocodilian">crocodilian</a>s.

The tail club of "Ankylosaurus" seems to have been an active defensive weapon, capable of producing enough of an impact to break the bones of an assailant. The tendons of the tail were partially ossified and were not very elastic, allowing great force to be transmitted to the club when it was used as a weapon. Coombs suggested in 1979 that several hindlimb muscles would have controlled the swinging of the tail, and that violent thrusts of the club would have been able to break the <a href="metatarsal%20bones">metatarsal bones</a> of large <a href="Theropoda">theropods</a>. A 2009 study estimated that ankylosaurids could swing their tails at 100 degrees laterally, and the mainly <a href="Bone">cancellous</a> clubs would have had a lowered <a href="moment%20of%20inertia">moment of inertia</a> and been effective weapons. The study also found that while adult ankylosaurid tail clubs were capable of breaking bones, those of juveniles were not. Despite the feasibility of tail-swinging, the researchers could not determine whether ankylosaurids used their clubs for defense against potential predators, in <a href="Intraspecific%20competition">intraspecific combat</a>, or both.

In 1993 Tony Thulborn proposed that the tail club of ankylosaurids primarily acted as a decoy for the head, as he thought the tail too short and inflexible to have an effective reach; the "dummy head" would lure a predator close to the tail, where it could be struck. Carpenter has rejected this idea, as tail club shape is highly variable among ankylosaurids, even in the same genus.

"Ankylosaurus" existed between 68 and 66 million years ago, in the final, or Maastrichtian, stage of the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> Period. It was among the last dinosaur genera that appeared before the <a href="Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene%20extinction%20event">Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event</a>. The type specimen is from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana, while other specimens have been found in the Lance and <a href="Ferris%20Formation">Ferris Formation</a>s in Wyoming, the Scollard Formation in Alberta, and the <a href="Frenchman%20Formation">Frenchman Formation</a> in Saskatchewan, all of which date to the end of the Cretaceous.

Fossils of "Ankylosaurus" are rare in these <a href="sediment">sediment</a>s, and the distribution of its remains suggests that it was ecologically rare, or restricted to the uplands of the formations rather than the coastal lowlands, where it would have been more likely to fossilize. Another ankylosaur, a nodosaur referred to as "Edmontonia" sp., is also found in the same formations, but according to Carpenter, the range of the two genera does not seem to have overlapped. Their remains have so far not been found in the same localities, and the nodosaur appears to have inhabited the lowlands. The narrower muzzle of the nodosaur suggests it had a more selective diet than "Ankylosaurus", further indicating <a href="Niche%20differentiation">ecological separation</a>, whether their range overlapped or not.

With its low center of gravity, "Ankylosaurus" would have been unable to knock down trees like modern elephants do. It was also incapable of chewing bark and thus unlikely to have practiced bark stripping. As an adult, "Ankylosaurus" does not appear to have congregated in groups (though some ankylosaurs appear to have congregated when young). So, although it was a large herbivore with similar energetic requirements, it is therefore improbable that "Ankylosaurus" was able to modify the landscape of its ecosystem in the way elephants do; <a href="hadrosaurid">hadrosaurid</a>s may instead have had such an "<a href="ecosystem%20engineer">ecosystem engineer</a>" role.

The formations where "Ankylosaurus" fossils have been found represent different sections of the western shore of the <a href="Western%20Interior%20Seaway">Western Interior Seaway</a> dividing western and eastern North America during the Cretaceous, a broad coastal plain extending westward from the seaway to the newly formed <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>. These formations are composed largely of <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> and <a href="mudstone">mudstone</a>, which have been attributed to <a href="floodplain">floodplain</a> environments. The regions where "Ankylosaurus" and other Late Cretaceous ankylosaurs have been found had a warm <a href="Subtropics">subtropical</a>/<a href="temperate">temperate climate</a>, which was <a href="monsoonal">monsoonal</a>, had occasional rainfall, <a href="tropical%20storms">tropical storms</a>, and <a href="forest%20fires">forest fires</a>. In the Hell Creek Formation, many types of plants were supported, primarily <a href="angiosperm">angiosperm</a>s, with less common <a href="conifer">conifer</a>s, <a href="fern">fern</a>s and <a href="cycad">cycad</a>s. An abundance of fossil leaves found at dozens of different sites indicates that the area was largely forested by small trees. "Ankylosaurus" shared its environment with other dinosaurs that included the <a href="Ceratopsidae">ceratopsids</a> "<a href="Triceratops">Triceratops</a>" and "<a href="Torosaurus">Torosaurus</a>", the <a href="hypsilophodont">hypsilophodont</a> "<a href="Thescelosaurus">Thescelosaurus</a>", the hadrosaurid "<a href="Edmontosaurus">Edmontosaurus</a>", an indeterminate nodosaur, the <a href="pachycephalosauria">pachycephalosauria</a>n "<a href="Pachycephalosaurus">Pachycephalosaurus</a>", and the theropods "<a href="Struthiomimus">Struthiomimus</a>", "<a href="Ornithomimus">Ornithomimus</a>", "<a href="Pectinodon">Pectinodon</a>", and "Tyrannosaurus".

Hurricane Diane

Hurricane Diane was the costliest <a href="Atlantic%20hurricane">Atlantic hurricane</a> of its time. One of three hurricanes to hit <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> during the <a href="1955%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1955 Atlantic hurricane season</a>, it <a href="tropical%20cyclogenesis">formed</a> on August 7 from a <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a> between the <a href="Lesser%20Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a> and <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a>. Diane initially moved west-northwestward with little change in its intensity, but began to <a href="rapid%20deepening">strengthen rapidly</a> after turning to the north-northeast. On August 12, the hurricane reached peak <a href="maximum%20sustained%20winds">sustained winds</a> of 105 mph (165 km/h), making it a <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20scales">Category 2 hurricane</a>. Gradually weakening after veering back west, Diane made <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> near <a href="Wilmington%2C%20North%20Carolina">Wilmington, North Carolina</a>, as a strong tropical storm on August 17, just five days after <a href="Hurricane%20Connie">Hurricane Connie</a> struck near the same area. Diane weakened further after moving inland, at which point the <a href="National%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration">United States Weather Bureau</a> noted a decreased threat of further destruction. The storm turned to the northeast, and warm waters from the Atlantic Ocean helped produce record rainfall across the northeastern United States. On August 19, Diane emerged into the Atlantic Ocean southeast of New York City, becoming <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical</a> two days later and completely dissipating by August 23.

The first area affected by Diane was North Carolina, which suffered coastal flooding but little wind and rain damage. After the storm weakened in Virginia, it maintained an area of moisture that resulted in heavy rainfall after interacting with the <a href="Blue%20Ridge%20Mountains">Blue Ridge Mountains</a>, a process known as <a href="orographic%20lift">orographic lift</a>. Flooding affected roads and low-lying areas along the <a href="Potomac%20River">Potomac River</a>. The northernmost portion of Delaware also saw freshwater flooding, although to a much lesser extent than adjacent states. Diane produced heavy rainfall in eastern Pennsylvania, causing the worst floods on record there, largely in the <a href="Poconos">Poconos</a> and along the <a href="Delaware%20River">Delaware River</a>. Rushing waters demolished about 150 road and rail bridges and breached or destroyed 30 dams. The swollen <a href="Brodhead%20Creek">Brodhead Creek</a> virtually submerged a summer camp, killing 37 people. Throughout Pennsylvania, the disaster killed 101 people and caused an estimated $70 million in damage (1955 <a href="United%20States%20dollar">USD</a>). Additional flooding spread through the northwest portion of neighboring New Jersey, forcing hundreds of people to evacuate and destroying several bridges, including one built in 1831. Storm damage was evident but less significant in southeastern New York.

Damage from Diane was heaviest in Connecticut, where rainfall peaked at 16.86 in (428 mm) near <a href="Torrington%2C%20Connecticut">Torrington</a>. The storm produced the state's largest flood on record, which effectively split the state into two by destroying bridges and cutting communications. All major streams and valleys were flooded, and 30 <a href="stream%20gauge">stream gauge</a>s reported their highest levels on record. The <a href="Connecticut%20River">Connecticut River</a> at <a href="Hartford%2C%20Connecticut">Hartford</a> reached a water level of 30.6 ft (9.3 m), the third highest on record there. The flooding destroyed a large section of downtown <a href="Winsted%2C%20Connecticut">Winsted</a>, much of which was never rebuilt. Record-high tides and flooded rivers heavily damaged <a href="Woonsocket%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Woonsocket, Rhode Island</a>. In Massachusetts, flood water levels surpassed those during the <a href="1938%20Long%20Island%20hurricane">1938 Long Island hurricane</a>, breaching multiple dams and inundating adjacent towns and roads. Throughout New England, 206 dams were damaged or destroyed, and about 7,000 people were injured. Nationwide, Diane killed at least 184 people and destroyed 813 houses, with another 14,000 homes heavily damaged. Monetary losses totaled $754.7 million, although the inclusion of loss of business and personal revenue increased the total to over $1 billion. In the hurricane's wake, eight states were declared federal disaster areas, and the name Diane was <a href="List%20of%20retired%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20names">retired</a>.

Hurricane Diane originated in a <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a> first observed as a tropical depression on August 7 between the <a href="Lesser%20Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a> and <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a>. The system moved generally to the west-northwest, intensifying into a tropical storm on August 9. By the time the <a href="National%20Weather%20Service">Weather Bureau</a> first classified the storm on August 10, Diane was south of the <a href="Azores%20High">Bermuda high</a>, a semi-permanent <a href="ridge%20%28meteorology%29">ridge in the jet stream</a> just east of <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>. Ships in the region of the storm reported winds of . During the next day, the <a href="Hurricane%20Hunters">Hurricane Hunters</a> reported no increase in strength, and Diane initially remained disorganized. The storm interacted with <a href="Hurricane%20Connie">Hurricane Connie</a> to its northwest in a process known as the <a href="Fujiwhara%20effect">Fujiwhara effect</a>, in which Diane turned toward the north. Quick intensification ensued, potentially due to interaction with a <a href="cold-core%20low">cold-core low</a> that increased <a href="atmospheric%20instability">atmospheric instability</a>. On August 12, the storm <a href="rapid%20deepening">rapidly intensified</a> into a hurricane. The intensification was so quick that a ship southeast of the center believed Diane was undergoing a loop due to a steady drop in <a href="atmospheric%20pressure">barometric pressure</a>, despite moving away from the hurricane.

At its peak, Diane developed a well-defined <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a> about in diameter, described by <a href="reconnaissance%20aircraft">reconnaissance aircraft</a> as taking the shape of an "inverted teacup". The strongest winds were located in the northeast quadrant, where there was a secondary pressure minimum located northeast of the eye. After moving to the north for about a day, Diane resumed its westward motion on August 13, after Hurricane Connie to the northwest had weakened. That day, Diane reached its lowest pressure of , and peak winds of 105 mph (170 km/h); originally the hurricane was analyzed to reach peak winds of 120 mph (195 km/h), although the large size and slow forward speed suggested the lower winds. It maintained its peak winds for about 12 hours, after which it weakened due to cooler air in the region. By August 15, the eye had become poorly defined, and winds steadily weakened. As it approached land, its center deteriorated, with minimal precipitation near the center; the eye was observed on a radar installed in July 1955. On August 17, Diane made <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> on the coast of <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> near <a href="Wilmington%2C%20North%20Carolina">Wilmington</a>. Pressure at landfall was estimated at , accompanied by winds just under hurricane intensity. Diane struck the state only five days after Hurricane Connie struck the same general area.

Diane quickly weakened as a tropical storm over the mountainous terrain of central North Carolina. The associated area of precipitation expanded and spread away from the center to the north and northeast. The weakening system turned to the north and recurved toward the northeast through Virginia after a ridge built in from the west. It did not interact much with the non-tropical <a href="westerlies">westerlies</a>, and as a result it remained a distinct tropical cyclone over land. Convection redeveloped as the storm approached the Atlantic coast once again. Diane passed through the <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20states">Mid-Atlantic states</a>, exiting New Jersey on August 19 into the Atlantic Ocean southeast of New York City. Paralleling the southern coast of <a href="New%20England">New England</a>, the storm later accelerated east-northeastward, becoming <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical</a> on August 21. Passing south and east of <a href="Newfoundland%20%28island%29">Newfoundland</a>, the remnants of Diane accelerated and restrengthened slightly while moving to the northeast. Late on August 23, the storm dissipated between Greenland and Iceland.

Late on August 14, more than two days before Diane made landfall, the <a href="National%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration">United States Weather Bureau</a> issued a hurricane alert from Georgia through North Carolina. On August 15, the agency issued a <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20warnings%20and%20watches">hurricane warning</a> from <a href="Brunswick%2C%20Georgia">Brunswick, Georgia</a> to Wilmington, North Carolina, although the warning was later extended to the south and north to <a href="Fernandina%2C%20Florida">Fernandina, Florida</a> and <a href="Cape%20Hatteras%2C%20North%20Carolina">Cape Hatteras, North Carolina</a>, respectively. The agency also issued storm warnings southward to <a href="Saint%20Augustine%2C%20Florida">Saint Augustine, Florida</a> and northward to <a href="Atlantic%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Atlantic City, New Jersey</a>, including the <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake</a> and <a href="Delaware%20Bay">Delaware</a> bays. Throughout the warned region, small ships were advised to remain at port. Before Diane made landfall, the North Carolina National Guard assisted in evacuating people near the <a href="Pamlico%20River">Pamlico River</a>, and 700 residents left their homes near <a href="New%20Bern%2C%20North%20Carolina">New Bern</a>; thousands of tourists also evacuated. The threat of the hurricane forced the planned retirement ceremony for <a href="Admiral">Admiral</a> <a href="Robert%20Carney">Robert Carney</a> to be transferred from an aircraft carrier in <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a> to an academy dormitory. All aircraft at <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Air%20Station%20Cherry%20Point">Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point</a> were flown to safer locations further inland.

All hurricane warnings were dropped after Diane moved inland. Forecasters downplayed the threat of Diane after it weakened over Virginia; the Weather Bureau agreed they did not foresee the extent of the rain that would occur, instead calling for just "some local flooding". The agency later admitted they "goofed" in downplaying the storm's destructive potential after weakening, noting their lack of experience with extreme rainfall events. Once the storm moved ashore, the Weather Bureau transferred official forecasting duties to regional offices, and local newspapers also issued their own forecasts. The <a href="The%20Republican%20%28Springfield%2C%20Massachusetts%29">Springfield Daily News</a> in Massachusetts noted that "moderate rains [were] possible" in its daily weather forecast ahead of the storm. Still, flood warnings were issued, with stream flooding forecasts of over 12 hours in advance. Along smaller rivers, including the <a href="Lehigh%20River">Lehigh</a>, <a href="Schuylkill%20River">Schuylkill</a>, and <a href="Farmington%20River">Farmington</a>, forecasts were issued every few hours.

In the summer of 1955, the eastern United States experienced generally hot and dry weather, leading to drought conditions and decreased water levels. When Hurricane Connie struck, its rainfall moistened the soil and heightened creeks throughout the Mid-Atlantic and New England. Hurricane Diane struck North Carolina just five days later and affected the same general area. After floods in 1936, the United States federal government enacted plans to prevent future devastating floods, although they made no progress by the time Connie and Diane struck in 1955. Along the Delaware River in the 1930s, state legislatures in New Jersey and Pennsylvania had established a commission that worked to clean up polluted water, but the legislators and commission blocked federal help, comparing it to European <a href="socialism">socialism</a>; this was in contrast to the federally funded <a href="Tennessee%20Valley%20Authority">Tennessee Valley Authority</a>, which mitigated flooding along the <a href="Tennessee%20River">Tennessee River</a>.

Hurricane Diane's path over the eastern United States brought heavy rainfall, fueled by unusually moist air resulting from abnormally high <a href="sea%20surface%20temperature">sea surface temperature</a>s. The worst flooding was in eastern Pennsylvania, northern New Jersey, southeastern New York, and southern New England. Of the 287 <a href="stream%20gauge">stream gauge</a>s in the region, 129 reported record levels during the course of the event. Many streams reported <a href="discharge%20%28hydrology%29">discharge</a> rates of more than double the previous records. Most of the flooding occurred along small rivers that rose to flood stage within hours, largely impacting populated areas; there were around 30 million people in the region affected by the floods. Overall, 813 houses were destroyed, with 14,000 heavily damaged. The floods severed infrastructure and affected several summer camps. Damage to public utilities was estimated at $79 million. Flooding in rural areas resulted in landslides in the mountains, while destroyed crops cost an estimated $7 million. Hundreds of miles of roads and bridges were also destroyed, accounting for $82 million in damage. Damage from Diane's winds were generally minor. The hurricane caused $754,706,000 in damage (1955 <a href="United%20States%20dollar">USD</a>), of which $600 million was in New England, making it the <a href="List%20of%20costliest%20Atlantic%20hurricanes">costliest</a> hurricane in American history at the time. Taking into account indirect losses, such as loss of wages and business earnings, Diane was described as "the first billion dollar hurricane." This contributed to 1955 being the costliest <a href="Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">Atlantic hurricane season</a> on record at the time. Overall, there were at least 184 deaths, potentially as many as 200.

The strongest <a href="maximum%20sustained%20wind">sustained winds</a> associated with Diane's landfall in North Carolina reached in <a href="Hatteras%2C%20North%20Carolina">Hatteras</a>, with gusts to in Wilmington. Any hurricane-force gusts were likely very sporadic and isolated in nature. Tides ran above normal near Wilmington, and waves in height struck the coast. The resultant <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a> damaged beach houses, flooded coastal roads, and destroyed seawalls damaged by Hurricane Connie a few days prior. The center of the hurricane passed over Wilmington without much of a decrease in winds, suggesting the eye was disorganized or even nonexistent. Little precipitation fell in and around the city, though precipitation was more substantial elsewhere in the state, peaking at in New Bern. At <a href="Oakway%2C%20South%20Carolina">Oakway</a> in neighboring South Carolina, rainfall amounted to .

After Diane crossed into Virginia, it dropped heavy rainfall of over in 24 hours in the <a href="Blue%20Ridge%20Mountains">Blue Ridge Mountains</a>, peaking at in <a href="Big%20Meadows">Big Meadows</a>. There, the rains were enhanced by moist air rising over the mountain peaks and condensing, a process known as <a href="orographic%20lift">orographic lift</a>. Rainfall of over occurred throughout Virginia, as well as into the <a href="Eastern%20Panhandle%20of%20West%20Virginia">Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia</a>, where was reported at <a href="Stony%20River%20Reservoir">Stony River Reservoir</a>. Similar precipitation amounts fell through Delaware, including at the <a href="United%20States%20National%20Arboretum">National Arboretum</a> in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> Rivers across the region rose above flood stage, including the <a href="James%20River">James River</a> which crested at in <a href="Columbia%2C%20Virginia">Columbia, Virginia</a>, which was above flood stage. High amounts of rainfall accrued in eastern Pennsylvania, peaking at in <a href="Big%20Bushkill%20Creek">Pecks Pond</a> in the northeast portion of the state. As with Virginia, the heaviest rainfall occurred due to orographic lift near a mountain. In neighboring New Jersey, the highest precipitation was near <a href="Sussex%2C%20New%20Jersey">Sussex</a>. Rainfall in New York peaked at in <a href="Lake%20Mohonk">Lake Mohonk</a>.

In Virginia, severe flooding occurred near <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond</a> and along the Blue Ridge Mountains. Near the coast, Diane damaged large areas of farmlands due to slow-moving floods. In the state, 21 gauges reported their highest levels on record. High levels along the <a href="Potomac%20River">Potomac River</a> flooded low-lying portions of Virginia and Washington, D.C. Wind gusts reached in <a href="Roanoke%2C%20Virginia">Roanoke</a>. In the state, flooding covered several roads, prompting closures. Due to the flat terrain, flooding in Delaware was described by the United States Geological Survey as "comparably mild". Flooding along the <a href="Brandywine%20Creek%20%28Christina%20River%29">Brandywine Creek</a> was at least the fifth highest in 45 years. Flooding was worst in the northernmost portion of the state.

Flooding began in many streams in eastern Pennsylvania on August 18. The <a href="Delaware%20River">Delaware River</a> crested at over in <a href="Easton%2C%20Pennsylvania">Easton</a>, which was above the previous record set in 1903. In <a href="Allentown%2C%20Pennsylvania">Allentown</a>, the Lehigh River crested at , surpassing the previous record of set in 1942. The floods were the worst in record across eastern portions of the state, notably in the Poconos and along all tributaries of the Delaware River from <a href="Honesdale%2C%20Pennsylvania">Honesdale</a> to Philadelphia. <a href="Lake%20Wallenpaupack">Lake Wallenpaupack</a> and other reservoirs mitigated flooding. Floods destroyed 17 bridges and of track along the <a href="Delaware%2C%20Lackawanna%20and%20Western%20Railroad">Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad</a>, which is the primary rail line in northeastern Pennsylvania. Damage to the line totaled several million dollars, and overall railroad damage in the state totaled $16 million. Hundreds of cars were damaged in the region. Damage extended into Philadelphia due to flooding along the Schuylkill River, but the damage was minor. In the small village of <a href="Upper%20Black%20Eddy%2C%20Pennsylvania">Upper Black Eddy</a>, hundreds of people became homeless, and the post office was washed away. Statewide, the floods destroyed or breached 30 dams, and destroyed about 150 road of rail bridges. Flooding left home and factory damage in the Allentown area. In the <a href="Poconos">Poconos</a> in Pennsylvania, the <a href="Brodhead%20Creek">Brodhead Creek</a> nearly destroyed a camp, killing 37 people, mostly children. Many people at the camp fled to a lodge that was ultimately destroyed. The Brodhead Creek also washed out a bridge along <a href="U.S.%20Route%20209">U.S. Route 209</a> between <a href="Stroudsburg%2C%20Pennsylvania">Stroudsburg</a> and <a href="East%20Stroudsburg%2C%20Pennsylvania">East Stroudsburg</a>, flooding both cities. There were about 75 deaths in the area, and another 10 deaths occurred in <a href="Greentown%2C%20Pennsylvania">Greentown</a> due to flooding along the <a href="Lackawaxen%20River">Lackawaxen River</a>. Overall, there were 101 deaths in the state, and damage totaled at least $70 million.

In New Jersey, flooding largely occurred north of <a href="Trenton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Trenton</a> and west of <a href="Perth%20Amboy%2C%20New%20Jersey">Perth Amboy</a>; rainfall in the southern two–thirds of the state was less than . The three major rivers in the area - the Delaware, <a href="Passaic%20River">Passaic</a>, and <a href="Raritan%20River">Raritan</a> - had severe flooding, and damage was widespread. When the <a href="Millstone%20River">Millstone River</a> flooded, two teenagers drowned while canoeing, and a police officer drowned while attempting to rescue them. About 200 families were evacuated in <a href="Oakland%2C%20New%20Jersey">Oakland</a> along the <a href="Ramapo%20River">Ramapo River</a>. Damage in the state was heaviest along the Delaware from <a href="Port%20Jervis%2C%20New%20York">Port Jervis, New York</a> to Trenton, where flooding inundated adjacent towns. Between the two towns, all but two bridges were damaged, including four that were destroyed. About 500 children had to be rescued from camps on three islands in the Delaware River; they were airlifted to a high school in <a href="Frenchtown%2C%20New%20Jersey">Frenchtown</a>. In that city, about 200 people were forced to evacuate their houses along the water. In Trenton, workers used sandbags to prevent flooding from affecting government buildings. Flooding destroyed the <a href="Portland%E2%80%93Columbia%20Pedestrian%20Bridge">Portland–Columbia Pedestrian Bridge</a>, first constructed in 1831, after most of it was submerged. The center of the <a href="Northampton%20Street%20Bridge">Northampton Street Bridge</a> between Easton, Pennsylvania and <a href="Phillipsburg%2C%20New%20Jersey">Phillipsburg, New Jersey</a> collapsed. A dam near <a href="Branchville%2C%20New%20Jersey">Branchville</a> collapsed, flooding the town and causing heavy damage. About 200 homes were damaged or destroyed in <a href="Lambertville%2C%20New%20Jersey">Lambertville</a>. Statewide, 93 homes were destroyed. Damage was estimated at $27.5 million.

Flash floods occurred in mountainous regions of southeastern New York, including Port Jervis along the Delaware River. <a href="Wappinger%20Creek">Wappinger Creek</a> flooded to cause heavy damage. Most streams in the <a href="Rondout%20Creek">Rondout Creek</a> basin left damage due to fast-moving waters, including heavy damage near <a href="Ellenville%2C%20New%20York">Ellenville</a>. Damage in New York was largely limited to an area between Port Jervis and <a href="Poughkeepsie%2C%20New%20York">Poughkeepsie</a>. Several bridges were destroyed along the <a href="Bash%20Bish%20Falls">Bash Bish Brook</a>, and portions of U.S. Route 209 were flooded. Damage totaled $16.2 million, and there was one death in the state.

Diane produced heavy rainfall after recurving inland, setting rainfall records in several areas. <a href="Windsor%20Locks%2C%20Connecticut">Windsor Locks, Connecticut</a> reported in a 23‑hour period; the station's total, located near <a href="Hartford%2C%20Connecticut">Hartford</a>, was higher than the 24‑hour rainfall record in Hartford. Some locations along the <a href="Housatonic%20River">Housatonic River</a> experienced per hour over 24 hours. The highest total in the state was at a station near <a href="Torrington%2C%20Connecticut">Torrington</a>. This is the highest rainfall on record in the state. The highest rainfall in the United States related to the storm was in <a href="Westfield%2C%20Massachusetts">Westfield, Massachusetts</a>, which was also the wettest known storm in the state's history as well as throughout New England. Other statewide rainfall maxima in New England included in <a href="Greenville%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Greenville, Rhode Island</a>, in <a href="Essex%20Junction%2C%20Vermont">Essex Junction, Vermont</a>, in <a href="Fitzwilliam%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Fitzwilliam, New Hampshire</a>, and at <a href="Flagstaff%20Lake%20%28Maine%29">Long Falls Dam</a> in Maine. Throughout New England, 206 dams were damaged or destroyed, mostly in the region south of <a href="Worcester%2C%20Massachusetts">Worcester, Massachusetts</a>. About 7,000 people were injured throughout New England, most of whom in Connecticut.

Damage was greatest in Connecticut, where floods affected about two-thirds of the state. It was the largest flood on record in the state's history. All major streams and valleys were flooded during the storm, including hundreds of tributaries, and 30 gauges in the state reported the highest level on record. The <a href="Connecticut%20River">Connecticut River</a> at Hartford reached the third-highest level on record at the time, cresting at , or above flood stage. Although there was rural damage, the city of Hartford was spared from flooding due to previously constructed dykes. The <a href="Naugatuck%20River">Naugatuck River</a> had significant flooding that damaged or destroyed every bridge across it and did extensive damage in Ansonia. In <a href="Waterbury%2C%20Connecticut">Waterbury</a>, the river washed buildings and railroad girders into a bridge. In the city, 30 people were killed, including 26 in 13 houses that were washed away in one block. The <a href="Quinebaug%20River">Quinebaug River</a> flooded the city of <a href="Putnam%2C%20Connecticut">Putnam</a> at the same time that a major fire originated at a <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a> plant. Much of the commercial district of <a href="Winsted%2C%20Connecticut">Winsted</a> was destroyed by the Mad River, which reached deep; the floods destroyed most buildings on the south side of the town's Main Street, and carried away several cars from a car dealership. The local newspaper reported that 95% of businesses were destroyed or severely damaged in Winsted. High rivers destroyed historical sites and buildings, and statewide Diane destroyed 563 houses. There were 77 deaths in the state and $350 million in damage. Most of the damage in the state was industrial or commercial damage.

In Rhode Island, flooding was worst in the northern portion of the state, mostly along the <a href="Blackstone%20River">Blackstone River</a>, which expanded to a width of about . The Horseshoe Dam was washed out, causing heavy damage in <a href="Woonsocket%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Woonsocket</a>. There, about 6,000 of its 50,000 residents were left unemployed. Record high tides were also reported. In Rhode Island, damage was estimated at $21 million, mostly in Woonsocket, and there were three deaths.

Much of southern Massachusetts, from its border with New York toward Worcester and to the ocean, experienced flooding. Most streams in western Massachusetts overflowed their banks, and in southeastern Massachusetts, which is largely flat terrain, streams flooded large areas along their channels; these streams moved slowly, while other areas in New England sustained damage due to the fast-moving nature of the floods. Record flooding was reported along 24 stream gauges in the state, including ones that surpassed the peak set by the <a href="1938%20New%20England%20hurricane">1938 New England hurricane</a>. Both the <a href="Charles%20River">Charles</a> and <a href="Neponset%20River">Neponset</a> rivers were among those that flooded. About 40% of the city of Worcester was flooded during Diane, and in <a href="Russell%2C%20Massachusetts">Russell</a>, the state police forced many residents to evacuate. In <a href="Weymouth%2C%20Massachusetts">Weymouth</a>, the floods were considered at least a <a href="return%20period">1 in 50 year</a> event. The <a href="Little%20River%20%28Merrimack%20River%29">Little River</a> in <a href="Buffumville%20Lake">Buffumville, Massachusetts</a> had a peak discharge of 8,340 ft³/s (236 m³/s), which was 6.2 times greater than the previous peak and 28.5 times the average annual flooding. Flooded rivers breached <a href="Run-of-the-river%20hydroelectricity">run-of-the-river dams</a> and covered nearby roadways, although dams with reservoirs resulted in less flooding. Nearly all dams along the <a href="French%20River%20%28Massachusetts%29">French River</a> were severely damaged or destroyed. One failed dam in <a href="Auburn%2C%20Massachusetts">West Auburn</a> washed out a portion of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2020%20in%20Massachusetts">U.S. Route 20</a>, and the same route was washed out near <a href="Charlton%2C%20Massachusetts">Charlton</a>. An overflown brook also damaged the <a href="Massachusetts%20Turnpike">Massachusetts Turnpike</a>. A train on the <a href="Boston%20and%20Albany%20Railroad">Boston and Albany Railroad</a> line plunged into a washed out portion along the <a href="Westfield%20River">Westfield River</a>. Along the same river, floods destroyed roads and tobacco farms. In the state, 97 houses were destroyed. Damage in Massachusetts was second worst of the affected states, totaling $110 million; the damage was largely due to flooded basements. There were 12 deaths in the state.

In Diane's immediate aftermath, one of the first priorities in response was to distribute adequate inoculations for <a href="typhoid">typhoid</a> amongst the widespread areas left without clean drinking water. The United States Army assisted in search and rescue operations using helicopters. After the floods of Hurricane Diane, more than 100,000 people fled to shelter or away from their houses. The <a href="American%20Red%20Cross">American Red Cross</a> quickly provided aid to the affected residents, using churches and public buildings to house homeless people. In the two weeks after the storm, Americans donated about $10 million to the Red Cross. The countries of Great Britain, Netherlands, Australia, Canada, France, Austria, and Venezuela offered aid to help the flood victims, sending emergency supplies. Additional flooding affected New England in September and October 1955, although neither was as major as those caused by Hurricane Diane. Following Diane, hundreds of companies affected by the flooding installed waterproof doors and windows to preempt similar disasters in the future.

<a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Dwight%20Eisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a> declared eight states as disaster areas, making them eligible for federal aid. The <a href="Small%20Business%20Administration">Small Business Administration</a> opened 18 temporary offices in the eastern United States for people to take out disaster loan applications. In the months after the storm, both the United States federal government and the American Red Cross had difficulty raising enough funds for the storm victims; collectively, the Red Cross, the Small Business Administration, and <a href="Farmers%20Home%20Administration">Farmers Home Administration</a> raised $37 million, which was less than 8% of Diane's damage total. Throughout 1955, the Red Cross assisted about 10,000 families in New England and the Mid-Atlantic states; some of the families received aid to move to a new house not in a flood zone. The Small Business Administration provided about 1,600 loans, totaling $25 million, for small businesses. <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senator</a> <a href="Herbert%20H.%20Lehman">Herbert H. Lehman</a> proposed a $12 billion <a href="National%20Flood%20Insurance%20Program">federal flood insurance program</a>. In 1956, the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> passed the Federal Flood Insurance Act, but the program was not enacted due to lack of funding. A nationwide flood program was not enacted until the passage of the <a href="National%20Flood%20Insurance%20Act%20of%201968">National Flood Insurance Act of 1968</a>. After the floods from Diane, the American federal government provided funding for the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">Army Corps of Engineers</a> to construct dams and reservoirs throughout New England to mitigate future flooding. In about 14 years, the Corps built 29 dams in Connecticut alone at the cost of $70 million, including three along the Connecticut River. The federal government restored plans from the 1930s to build dams along the Delaware River, one of which along <a href="Tocks%20Island">Tocks Island</a>. A <a href="Tocks%20Island%20Dam%20Controversy">controversy</a> arose there due to the long reservoir the dam would have created, causing 600 families to be displaced. The project was canceled in 1975, and the acquired lands became the <a href="Delaware%20Water%20Gap%20National%20Recreation%20Area">Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area</a>.

In Pennsylvania, washed-out rail lines prevented operation along the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad for several weeks, and lines reopened after about two months. The expense of reopening, and the loss of being closed, led to the railroad merging with the <a href="Erie%20Railroad">Erie Railroad</a> to become the <a href="Erie%20Lackawanna%20Railway">Erie Lackawanna Railway</a> in 1960. One stranded train along the line prompted a helicopter to rescue 235 people. Flooding along the Lehigh River destroyed 15 industrial plants, which left more than 15,000 people near Allentown, Pennsylvania without work temporarily. The mayor of <a href="Scranton%2C%20Pennsylvania">Scranton</a> declared a state of emergency due to the floods, ordering all businesses to close. <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> soldiers provided water to residents after the town lost its water supply. Elsewhere, the <a href="Pennsylvania%20National%20Guard">Pennsylvania National Guard</a> was on duty on streets in damaged towns, including 50 to prevent looting in Upper Black Eddy, which was one of the hardest hit towns. Helicopters assisted in discovering bodies at Camp Davis, where many deaths occurred during the storm. Statewide, thousands of people were left homeless. In Stroudsburg, there was a food shortage, and officials enacted a curfew, after reports of looting. In the same city, water was shipped in milk cartons to the flood victims, which later inspired a <a href="Federal%20Civil%20Defense%20Administration">Federal Civil Defense Administration</a> proposal to use water packaged in milk containers in the event of a nuclear attack. The state government implemented a tax on cigarettes to help pay for storm damage, which lasted for about two years; this was partially due to a lack of significant funding from the federal government. Pennsylvania also enacted an increase in the gasoline tax that was later made permanent to pay for the <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway System</a>. The two taxes, each an increase of 1 <a href="U.S.%20penny">penny</a>, totaled $71 million, a part of which was set aside for future disasters. The experience of the storm's aftermath provided the basis for the aftermath for <a href="Hurricane%20Agnes">Hurricane Agnes</a> in 1972. In New Jersey, <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20New%20Jersey">Governor</a> <a href="Robert%20B.%20Meyner">Robert B. Meyner</a> declared the floods as at the time the state's worst natural disaster.

After the Naugatuck River flood in Connecticut cut off communications and bridges, the state was effectively cut in two. The state's <a href="Connecticut%20National%20Guard">National Guard</a> used helicopters to rescue people. Governor <a href="Abraham%20A.%20Ribicoff">Abraham A. Ribicoff</a> visited areas affected by the flooding, due to the damage, Connecticut was declared a federal disaster area on August 20. The declaration allocated $25 million in assistance to the state. Governor Ribicoff requested $34 million in funds to rebuild and produce future flood mitigation projects; the state's funding was paid by a combination of <a href="Bond%20%28finance%29">bonds</a> and tax increases. Including subsequent storms, the 1955 floods cumulatively killed 91 people and left 1,100 families homeless. Flooding occurred in 67 towns, resulting in damage to 20,000 families. About 86,000 people were left unemployed after the floods. In Winsted, the buildings that were washed away along the south side of Main Street were never rebuilt.

Massachusetts Governor <a href="Christian%20Herter">Christian Herter</a> also issued a state of emergency, due to the widespread flooding damage. As a result, the state's National Guard and the Army Corps assisted in cleanup, and most roads took three weeks to clear. Residents in areas affected by Diane's flooding were advised to boil water and not to use gas cooking equipment. Diane's historic rainfall resulted in the wettest month on record in Boston with a total of , a record that stands as of 2010; Boston's 24‑hour total of remained the highest daily total as of 1996. Following Diane's floods, cities in Massachusetts enlarged <a href="culvert">culvert</a>s and improved draining systems, as well as constructing <a href="weir">weir</a>s; these systems helped mitigate against future flooding.

The name Diane was <a href="List%20of%20retired%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20names">retired</a> from the <a href="North%20Atlantic%20tropical%20cyclone">Atlantic hurricane</a> naming list. Due to the damage from hurricanes in 1954 and 1955, including Diane, public outcry over storm damage led to the creation of the <a href="National%20Hurricane%20Center">National Hurricane Center</a> in 1956. Using a monetary <a href="deflator">deflator</a> in 2010 United States dollars, the damage from Diane would be about $7.4 billion, which would have been the 17th highest in the United States. Accounting for inflation, changes in personal wealth, and population changes, it is estimated Diane would have caused $18 billion in damage in 2010, or the 15th highest for a United States hurricane.

Hurricane Hattie

Hurricane Hattie was the strongest and deadliest <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a> of the <a href="1961%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1961 Atlantic hurricane season</a>, reaching a peak intensity equivalent to that of a <a href="List%20of%20Category%205%20Atlantic%20hurricanes">Category 5 hurricane</a>. The ninth tropical storm and seventh hurricane and <a href="major%20hurricane">major hurricane</a> of the season, Hattie originated from an area of <a href="Low-pressure%20area">low pressure</a> that strengthened into a tropical storm over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on October 27. Moving generally northward, the storm quickly became a hurricane and later major hurricane the following day. Hattie then turned westward west of <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> and strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane, with <a href="maximum%20sustained%20wind">maximum sustained wind</a>s of . It weakened to Category 4 before making <a href="Landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> south of <a href="Belize%20City">Belize City</a> on October 31. The storm turned southwestward and weakened rapidly over the mountainous terrain of Central America, dissipating on November 1.

Hattie first affected the southwestern Caribbean, where it produced hurricane-force winds and caused one death on <a href="San%20Andr%C3%A9s%20%28island%29">San Andres Island</a>. It was initially forecast to continue north and strike <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>, prompting evacuations on the island. While turning west, Hattie dropped heavy rainfall of up to on <a href="Grand%20Cayman">Grand Cayman</a>. The country of <a href="Belize">Belize</a>, at the time known as <a href="British%20Honduras">British Honduras</a>, sustained the worst damage from the hurricane. The former capital, Belize City, was buffeted by strong winds and flooded by a powerful <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a>. The territory governor estimated that 70% of the buildings in the city had been damaged, leaving more than 10,000 people homeless. The destruction was so severe that it prompted the government to relocate inland to a new city, <a href="Belmopan">Belmopan</a>. Overall, Hattie caused about $60 million in losses and 307 deaths in the territory. Although damage was heavier in Hattie than a <a href="1931%20Belize%20hurricane">hurricane in 1931</a> that killed 2,000 people, the death toll from Hattie was less due to advance warnings. Elsewhere in Central America, Hattie killed 11 people in Guatemala and one in Honduras.

For several days toward the end of October 1961, a <a href="low-pressure%20area">low-pressure area</a> persisted in the western <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a>, north of the <a href="Panama%20Canal%20Zone">Panama Canal Zone</a>. On October 25, an upper-level <a href="anticyclone">anticyclone</a> moved over the low; the next day, a <a href="trough%20%28meteorology%29">trough</a> over the western Gulf of Mexico provided favorable <a href="outflow%20%28meteorology%29">outflow</a> for the disturbance. At 0000 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a> on October 27, a ship nearby reported southerly winds of 46 mph (74 km/h). Later that day, the airport on <a href="San%20Andr%C3%A9s%20%28island%29">San Andres Island</a> reported easterly winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). The two observations confirmed the presence of a closed wind circulation, centered about 70 miles (110 km) southeast of San Andres, or 155 mi (250 km) east of the Nicaraguan coast; as a result, the <a href="National%20Weather%20Service">Miami Weather Bureau</a> began issuing advisories on the newly formed Tropical Storm Hattie.

After being classified, Hattie moved steadily northward, passing very near or over San Andres Island. A station on the island recorded a pressure of and sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h), which indicated that Hattie had reached hurricane status. Late on October 28, a <a href="Hurricane%20Hunters">Hurricane Hunters</a> flight encountered a much stronger hurricane, with winds of 125 mph (200 km/h) in a small area near the center. At the time, gale-force winds extended outward 140 mi (225 km) to the northeast and 70 miles (115 km) to the southwest. Early on October 29, a trough extending from Nicaragua to Florida was expected to allow Hattie to continue northward, based on climatology for similar hurricanes. Later that day, Hattie was forecast to be an imminent threat to the <a href="Cayman%20Islands">Cayman Islands</a> and western Cuba. Around that time, a strengthening <a href="ridge%20%28meteorology%29">ridge</a> to the north turned the hurricane northwestward, which spared the <a href="Greater%20Antilles">Greater Antilles</a> but increased the threat to <a href="Central%20America">Central America</a>.

With the strengthening ridge to its north, Hattie began restrengthening after retaining the same intensity for about 24 hours. Initially, forecasters at the Miami Weather Bureau predicted the storm to turn northward again. Late on October 29, the center of the hurricane passed about 90 miles (145 km) southwest of <a href="Grand%20Cayman">Grand Cayman</a>, at which time the interaction between Hattie and the ridge to its north produced squally winds of around 30 mph (50 km/h) across Florida. Early on October 30, the Hurricane Hunters confirmed the increase in intensity, reporting winds of 140 mph (225 km/h). The storm's <a href="atmospheric%20pressure">minimum central pressure</a> continued to drop throughout the day, reaching by 1300 UTC; a lower pressure of was computed at 1700 UTC that day, based on a flight-level reading from the Hurricane Hunters. Hattie later curved toward the west-southwest, passing between the Cayman Islands and the <a href="Swan%20Islands%2C%20Honduras">Swan Islands</a>. Late on October 30, Hattie attained peak winds of 160 mph (260 km/h) about 190 mi (310 km) east of the border of Mexico and <a href="British%20Honduras">British Honduras</a>. This made Hattie the equivalence of a <a href="List%20of%20Atlantic%20Category%205%20hurricanes">Category 5</a> hurricane on the <a href="Saffir-Simpson%20Hurricane%20Scale">Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale</a>, making it the latest hurricane on record to reach the status until a <a href="Atlantic%20hurricane%20reanalysis%20project">reanalysis</a> of the <a href="1932%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1932 season</a> revealed that <a href="1932%20Cuba%20hurricane">Hurricane Fourteen</a> had a similar intensity on November 5, six days after Hattie. Additionally, Hattie was the strongest October hurricane in the northwest Caribbean until <a href="Hurricane%20Mitch">Hurricane Mitch</a> in 1998.

Hattie maintained much of its intensity as it continued toward the coast of British Honduras. After moving through several small islands offshore, the hurricane made <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> a short distance south of <a href="Belize%20City">Belize City</a> on October 31, with an <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eyewall</a> of about 25 miles (40 km) in diameter. Based on a post-season analysis, it was determined that Hattie had weakened to winds of 140 mph (225 km/h) before moving ashore. The hurricane deteriorated rapidly over land, dissipating on November 1 as it moved into the mountains of <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>. During its dissipation, <a href="1961%20Pacific%20hurricane%20season%23Tropical%20Storm%20Simone">Tropical Storm Simone</a> was developing off the Pacific coast of Guatemala. There was speculation that Hattie contributed to the development of Simone, and later <a href="1961%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season%23Tropical%20Storm%20Inga">Tropical Storm Inga</a> after the remnants of Simone merged with nearby disturbed weather.

Upon initiating advisories on Hattie, the Miami Weather Bureau noted the potential for heavy rainfall and <a href="flash%20flood">flash flood</a>ing in the southwestern Caribbean. The advisories recommended for small ships to remain at harbor across the region. Initially, the hurricane was predicted to move near or through the Cayman Islands, Jamaica, and Cuba. As a result, Cuban officials advised residents in low-lying areas to evacuate.

Hurricane Hattie first posed a threat to the <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20Peninsula">Yucatán Peninsula</a> and British Honduras on October 30 when it turned toward the area. Officials at the Miami Weather Bureau warned of the potential for high tides, strong winds, and torrential rainfall. The warnings allowed for extensive evacuations in high-risk areas. Most people in the capital, Belize City, were evacuated or moved to shelters, and a school was operated as a refuge. A hospital in the city was evacuated, and over 75% of the population of <a href="Dangriga">Stann Creek</a> fled to safer locations. After Hattie made landfall, officials in Mexico ordered the closure of ports along the <a href="Isthmus%20of%20Tehuantepec">Isthmus of Tehuantepec</a>.

Despite predictions for heavy rainfall in the southwestern Caribbean, the hurricane's movement was more northerly than expected, resulting in less precipitation along the Central American coast than anticipated. In its early developmental stages, Hattie struck <a href="San%20Andr%C3%A9s%20%28island%29">San Andrés Island</a>, located offshore eastern <a href="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a>, with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) and gusts of 104 mph (167 km/h). As the hurricane neared the island, the airport was closed due to tropical-storm-force winds. Rough seas and winds damaged private property and two hotels. Many palm tree plantations were devastated. The schooner "Admirar", anchored in one of the island's bays, capsized during the storm. Overall, Hattie resulted in one death, fifteen injuries, and $300,000 in damage (1961 <a href="United%20States%20dollar">USD</a>) in San Andrés. The hurricane was the fourth on record to strike the island, and of the four was the only to approach from the south.

In the northwestern Caribbean, Hattie passed close to Grand Cayman with heavy rainfall. At least 11.5 inches (292 mm) of rain were reported on the island, including 7.8 inches (198 mm) in six hours. Winds on Grand Cayman were below hurricane force, and only minor damage occurred due to the rain.

The interaction between Hattie and the ridge of high pressure to its north produced sustained winds of 20 mph (35 km/h) across most of Florida, with a gust of 72 mph (116 km/h) reported at <a href="Hillsboro%20Inlet%20Light">Hillsboro Inlet Light</a>; the winds caused some <a href="beach%20erosion">beach erosion</a> in the state. The U.S. Weather Bureau issued a small craft warning for the west and east Florida coastlines, as well as northward to <a href="Brunswick%2C%20Georgia">Brunswick, Georgia</a>.

Later, Hattie impacted various countries in Central America with flash floods, causing 11 deaths in Guatemala and one fatality in Honduras. The <a href="Swan%20Islands%2C%20Honduras">Swan Islands</a> reported wind gusts just below hurricane force, resulting in minor damage and one injury.

Hurricane Hattie moved ashore in British Honduras with a <a href="storm%20tide">storm tide</a> of up to 14 feet (4.3 m) near Belize City, a city of 31,000 people located at sea-level; its only defenses against the storm tide were a small seawall and a strip of swamp lands. The capital experienced high waves and a 10 ft (3 m) storm tide along its waterfront that reached the third story of some buildings. A trained observer estimated winds of over 150 mph (240 km/h), and winds in the territory were unofficially estimated as strong as 200 mph (325 km/h). When Hattie affected the area, most buildings in Belize City were wooden, and most of this type were destroyed. Offshore, the hurricane heavily damaged 80% of the <a href="Belize%20Barrier%20Reef">Belize Barrier Reef</a>, although the reef recovered after the storm.
High winds caused a power outage, downed trees across the region, and destroyed the roofs of many buildings. <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20British%20Honduras">Governor Colin Thornley</a> estimated that over 70% of the buildings in the territory were damaged, and more than 10,000 people were left homeless. Some shelters set up before the storm were destroyed in the hurricane. The hurricane destroyed the wall at an <a href="psychiatric%20hospital">insane asylum</a>, which allowed the residents to escape. High waves damaged a prison, prompting officials to institute a "daily parole" program for the inmates. Hattie also flooded the <a href="Government%20House%2C%20Belize">Government House</a>, washing away all records. All of Belize City was coated in a layer of mud and debris, and majority of the city was destroyed or severely damaged, as was nearby <a href="Stann%20Creek%20District">Stann Creek</a>. The hurricane left significant crop damage across the region, including $2 million in citrus fruits and similar losses to timber, cocoa, and bananas. The year's production of sugar cane was also heavily damaged. About 70% of the territory's <a href="mahogany">mahogany</a> trees were downed, as were most citrus and grapefruit trees. The hurricane damaged several factories and oil rigs in the region. Damage throughout the territory totaled $60 million (1961 USD), and a total of 307 deaths were reported; more than 100 of the fatalities were in Belize City, including 36 who evacuated to a British administration building that was later destroyed in the storm. The government of British Honduras considered Hurricane Hattie more damaging than a <a href="1931%20Belize%20hurricane">hurricane in 1931</a> that killed 2,000 people; the lower death toll of Hattie was due to advance warning.

After Hattie struck, officials in Belize City declared <a href="martial%20law">martial law</a>. A manager of <a href="United%20Press%20International">United Press International</a> described Belize City as "nothing but a huge pile of matchsticks," and many roads were either flooded for days or covered with mud. Doctors provided <a href="typhoid">typhoid</a> vaccinations to 12,000 residents in two days to prevent the spread of the disease. Due to the high death toll, officials ordered mass cremations to stop additional disease from spreading. At the city's police station, workers provided fresh water and rice to storm victims. Many residents throughout British Honduras donated supplies to the storm victims, such that an airlines manager described it as "taxing... manpower and facilities." One airline allowed donations to be flown to Belize City at no cost. The city's three newspapers were unable to operate due to lack of power after the storm. By November 5, Belize City's post office reopened on a limited basis, and all business initially remained closed. About 4,000 homeless residents from <a href="Stann%20Creek%20District">Stann Creek</a> were moved by boat to the northern portion of the territory. Many homeless people from the Belize City area set up a <a href="tent%20city">tent city</a> on <a href="bushland">bushland</a> about inland, which was initially intended to be temporary. In December 1961, <a href="barracks">barracks</a> were erected near a Red Cross Hospital to house the homeless in the camp. The site was named <a href="Hattieville">Hattieville</a> and became a proper city, with utilities installed in the subsequent decade.

About 200 British soldiers arrived from Jamaica to quell looting and maintain order. At least 20 people were arrested in the day after Hattie struck. The British government sent flights of aid to the territory containing food, clothing, and medical supplies. The <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> quickly passed a bill to provide <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>10,000 in aid. The <a href="Save%20the%20Children">Save the Children</a> fund sent £1,000 to British Honduras, and the Mexican government sent three flights with food and medicine to the territory. Two American <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s arrived in the country by November 2, reporting the need for assistance. The <a href="USS%20Antietam%20%28CV-36%29">USS Antietam</a> remained at port for weeks after the storm with six medical officers and six <a href="United%20States%20Marines">Marine</a> helicopters. Four other ships sailed to the territory to provide 458,000 lb (208,000 kg) of food. The United States government allocated about $300,000 in assistance through the <a href="International%20Development%20Association">International Development Association</a>. The Canadian government provided <a href="Canadian%20dollar">C$</a>75,000 worth of aid, including food, blankets, and medical supplies.

By Hattie's one year anniversary, private and public workers repaired and rebuilt buildings affected by the storm. New hotels were constructed, and many stores were reopened. <a href="List%20of%20Prime%20Ministers%20of%20Belize">Prime Minister</a> <a href="George%20Cadle%20Price">George Cadle Price</a> successfully appealed for assistance from the British government, which ultimately provided £20 million in loans. In the days after the storm, the government announced plans to relocate the capital of British Honduras farther inland on higher ground. Work on the new capital, <a href="Belmopan">Belmopan</a>, was completed in 1970. On the 44th anniversary of the hurricane in 2005, the government of Belize unveiled a monument in Belize City to recognize the victims of the hurricane.

Due to the destruction and loss of life attributed to the hurricane, the name Hattie was <a href="List%20of%20retired%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20names">retired</a> by the <a href="World%20Meteorological%20Organization">World Meteorological Organization</a> and will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane.

Hurricane Eloise

Hurricane Eloise was the most destructive <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a> of the <a href="1975%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1975 Atlantic hurricane season</a>. The fifth tropical storm, fourth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the season, Eloise formed as a tropical depression on September 13 to the east of the <a href="Virgin%20Islands">Virgin Islands</a>. The depression tracked westward and intensified into a tropical storm while passing to the north of <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a>. Eloise briefly attained hurricane intensity soon thereafter, but weakened back to a tropical storm upon making <a href="Landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> over <a href="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a>. A weak and disorganized cyclone, Eloise emerged into open waters of the northern Caribbean Sea; upon striking the northern <a href="Yucatan%20Peninsula">Yucatan Peninsula</a>, it turned north and began to re-intensify. In the Gulf of Mexico, the cyclone quickly matured and became a <a href="Saffir-Simpson%20Hurricane%20Scale">Category 3 hurricane</a> on September 23. Eloise made landfall along the <a href="Florida%20Panhandle">Florida Panhandle</a> west of <a href="Panama%20City%2C%20Florida">Panama City</a> before moving inland across <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a> and dissipating on September 24.

The storm produced torrential rainfall throughout the islands of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, causing extensive flooding that led to severe damage and more than 40 deaths. Thousands of people in these areas became homeless as flood waters submerged numerous communities. As Eloise progressed westward, it affected Cuba to a lesser extent. In advance of the storm, about 100,000 residents evacuated from the Gulf Coast region. Upon making landfall in Florida, Eloise generated wind gusts of 155 miles per hour (249 km/h), which demolished hundreds of buildings in the area. The storm's severe winds, waves, and storm surge left numerous beaches, piers, and other coastal structures heavily impaired.

Wind-related damage extended into inland Alabama and Georgia. Further north, torrential rains along the entire East Coast of the United States created an unprecedented and far-reaching flooding event, especially into the <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20States">Mid-Atlantic States</a>. In that region, an additional 17 people died as a result of freshwater flooding from the post-tropical storm; infrastructural and geological effects were comparable to those from <a href="Hurricane%20Agnes">Hurricane Agnes</a> several years prior. Across the United States, damage amounted to approximately $560 million. The storm killed 80 people along its entire track; due to the severe damage, the name "Eloise" was <a href="List%20of%20retired%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20names">retired</a> from the Atlantic tropical cyclone naming lists.

The origins of Hurricane Eloise trace back to a <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a> that emerged from the western coast of Africa on September 6, 1975. Satellite imagery indicated that the system was initially disjointed and poorly developed, although there was evidence of a low-level circulation. The disturbance tracked westward for several days as it slowly matured. On September 13, a ship called the "Gulf Hansa" recorded winds of around and seas in association with the system. Shortly thereafter, a <a href="reconnaissance%20aircraft">reconnaissance aircraft</a> found a center of circulation east of the <a href="Virgin%20Islands">Virgin Islands</a>, and it is estimated that the storm became a tropical depression at 0600 UTC.

The depression continued moving towards the west as it gradually strengthened. On September 16, the system attained tropical storm status and was designated Eloise; accordingly, the first advisory on the system was issued by the San Juan Weather Bureau office. While in the vicinity of a strengthening <a href="anticyclone">anticyclone</a> aloft, Eloise became better organized, and the storm rapidly intensified and reached Category 1 hurricane status 18 hours after being named. The cyclone soon made landfall on the <a href="Dominican%20Republic">Dominican Republic</a>, inhibiting further development. Although initially predicted to remain north of land, the storm moved across northern Hispaniola and then tracked across southeastern <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>. After 36 hours with much of its circulation over mountainous terrain, Eloise deteriorated to a tropical storm on September 17.

The cyclone emerged over the open waters of the northern Caribbean on September 19, passing <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> to the north as it moved away from Cuba. Despite favorable upper-level conditions, its interaction with land—combined with the weakening of a <a href="ridge%20%28meteorology%29">ridge</a> to the north—left the storm's center distorted. Eloise remained a fairly disorganized tropical storm until September 20, when it approached the <a href="Yucatan%20Peninsula">Yucatan Peninsula</a> and began to re-intensify. The storm crossed over the northern tip of the peninsula as it began to turn northward in response to an approaching <a href="trough%20%28meteorology%29">trough</a>. Between September 17 and September 21, however, reports on the storm were scarce, leading to uncertainty in its exact location and strength. Upon entering the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, Eloise quickly organized. The trough enhanced the <a href="wind%20divergence">wind divergence</a> over the storm's center, allowing it to strengthen once again to reach hurricane force about south of <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>.
On September 22, the cyclone intensified to attain Category 2 strength, and became a major hurricane of Category 3 status shortly thereafter as it turned towards the northeast. Several ships penetrated the storm's center during its passage through the gulf. The hurricane also moved over two experimental buoys which recorded data on the storm, aiding meteorologists in their forecasts. Hurricane Eloise continued to strengthen until it reached its peak winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) and a minimum <a href="barometric%20pressure">barometric pressure</a> of about 955 mbar (hPa; 28.2 inHg). It moved ashore along the <a href="Florida%20Panhandle">Florida Panhandle</a> near <a href="Panama%20City%2C%20Florida">Panama City</a> on September 23. Shortly after making landfall, the hurricane rapidly degenerated. Just six hours later, it had weakened into a tropical storm, while situated over eastern <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a>. It further weakened into a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on September 24. The depression transitioned into an <a href="extratropical%20storm">extratropical storm</a> over <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, and became indistinguishable by later that same day. The remnant moisture, however, merged with a <a href="weather%20front">weather front</a> to produce widespread and heavy precipitation.

In advance of Hurricane Eloise, warnings for heavy rainfall and potential flooding were issued for <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a> and the Virgin Islands. A <a href="hurricane%20warning">hurricane warning</a> was declared for parts of the Dominican Republic about 12 hours before landfall. A "hurricane emergency" was put into effect for the <a href="Oriente%20%28province%29">Oriente Province</a> of Cuba, while a "state of alert" was issued for the <a href="Camag%C3%BCey%20Province">Camagüey Province</a>. <a href="Cubana%20de%20Aviaci%C3%B3n">Cubana de Aviación</a> suspended all flights to Oriente.

On and before September 15, there was still uncertainty as to whether Eloise would impact the United States. However, officials in Florida began taking precautionary measures. When the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico, forecasters suggested that the storm would continue northward and strike the area near <a href="Mobile%20Bay">Mobile Bay</a>. Contrary to predictions, by late on September 22, the storm had turned northeast, and some residents of Florida were still unaware of the storm's threat despite the issuance of hurricane warnings 24 hours in advance. As a result, evacuations were delayed to an extent. During the morning hours of September 23, civil preparedness workers drove through coastal towns with loudspeakers advising people to seek shelter. Due of the intensity of the approaching hurricane, evacuations along the coast were ultimately thorough, despite the initial delay. It was reported that 99% of <a href="Pensacola%2C%20Florida">Pensacola</a> residents along the beach had left their homes, and overall, 100,000 people evacuated from areas in Louisiana through Florida.

A statement issued by the <a href="National%20Weather%20Service">National Weather Service</a> advised people in nine Florida counties to complete hurricane preparations, which included securing loose objects and moving watercraft to safety. Homes along the coast were boarded up by their owners, while offshore, workers were removed from oil platforms. A spokesman for <a href="Royal%20Dutch%20Shell">Royal Dutch Shell</a> reported that 800 workers were to be evacuated. In New Orleans, emergency equipment was readied and inspected. The New Orleans Levee Board went into a second-stage alert on September 21, and cleared debris from floodwall openings.

As a weak tropical depression, the storm brought of rainfall to portions of the <a href="Leeward%20Islands">Leeward Islands</a>, including <a href="St.%20Kitts">St. Kitts</a> and <a href="St.%20Martin">St. Martin</a>. More minor amounts of precipitation fell over the northernmost islands, and winds were light in these areas.

Despite being only a tropical storm while passing by Puerto Rico, Eloise produced extreme amounts of rainfall on the island, peaking at in Dos Bocas. Other totals of were common. The heavy rains resulted in severe flash flooding which killed 34 people, mostly from drownings, and left $60 million in damages. Several hundred people were injured, and the storm forced over 6,000 residents from their homes. Dozens of towns and villages were flooded, though <a href="Utuado%2C%20Puerto%20Rico">Utuado</a>, with a population of 35,000 at the time, was hit the hardest. The situation in that town was described as a "total disaster"; four housing developments were under water, and dozens of vehicles were washed away. The flood waters submerged thousands of miles of roads and put several bridges out-of-service.

As the storm proceeded westward, it dropped heavy rainfall throughout eastern and southern Hispaniola. Widespread flooding impacted Haiti and the Dominican Republic, leaving a total of 25 people dead. Although the most intense winds remained offshore, a gust of was recorded at <a href="Cape%20Enga%C3%B1o%20%28Dominican%20Republic%29">Cape Engaño</a>. <a href="San%20Felipe%20de%20Puerto%20Plata">Puerto Plata</a> on the northern coast of the Dominican Republic was also battered by high winds and heavy rain. Following the storm, electricity was turned off due to the danger of electrocutions. Despite the storm's effects across Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, no monetary damage totals are available.

Rain and wind from the storm affected the southern <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a>, Cuba, <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, the <a href="Cayman%20Islands">Cayman Islands</a>, and the northern Yucatan Peninsula. Since the storm was primarily weak while passing by these areas, no significant damage was reported. Eloise brought torrential rainfall and winds of to the <a href="Guantanamo%20Bay%20Naval%20Base">Guantanamo Bay Naval Base</a> in southeastern Cuba, inflicting $65,000 in damage. Personnel on the base were moved to designated hurricane shelters in advance of the storm.

Eloise came ashore along the coast of northern Florida as a Category 3 storm producing winds of with gusts that reached 155 mph (249 km/h). Sustained winds were likely higher, but due to the sparsity of recording stations, few official records exist. The winds in the area were reportedly the strongest of the century. Hurricane-force winds occurred from <a href="Fort%20Walton%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Fort Walton Beach</a> through Panama City. Along the coast, tides ran above normal, peaking at . Hurricane Eloise spawned several tornadoes as it pressed inland. In general, rainfall ranged from ; at the <a href="Eglin%20Air%20Force%20Base">Eglin Air Force Base</a> near <a href="Valparaiso%2C%20Florida">Valparaiso</a>, however, the hurricane dropped of precipitation. The heaviest rainfall was usually confined to northwest of the storm's track, and a number of locations to the east of Eloise's center picked up less than of rain.

Damage from the hurricane was widespread. Fort Walton Beach, where hundreds of structures were damaged or destroyed, was hit particularly hard. In some areas, the storm surge washed away buildings demolished by the strong winds. The winds cleared certain locations of trees and buried properties and roads under sand. Throughout northwest Florida, an estimated 8,000 people suffered storm-related losses, and 500 businesses were completely destroyed. An article in the "<a href="Tallahassee%20Democrat">Tallahassee Democrat</a>" reported that "Cottages, motels, restaurants, convenience stores and other beach businesses were strewn across the highway in a tangle of down power poles, lines and busted mains." A shrimp farm at Panama City, the first of its kind, was effectively lost. The storm destroyed the farm's prospective initial harvest, of shrimp enclosed in a system of nets and enclosures. The president of the company described the subsequent events as six months of extreme turmoil in an effort to recover, followed by a quick and steady rebound. By the spring of 1976, the company became confident in financial success and full recovery.
The storm caused severe <a href="beach%20erosion">beach erosion</a> in <a href="Bay%20County%2C%20Florida">Bay County</a>; approximately of sand was removed. Storm-related changes in the coastal topography resulted in extensive structural damage in the <a href="Panama%20City%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Panama City Beach</a> area. The most severe damage was concentrated in a area of the shore east of the hurricane's eye, and storm surge peaked in intensity for no more than a half hour according to preliminary estimates. Much of the resultant damage came as a result of foundation undermining, which was compared to that of the <a href="New%20England%20hurricane%20of%201938">New England hurricane of 1938</a>. Although Eloise was not abnormally strong, the geographicy setting and building standards in the area were blamed for the destruction of many homes and businesses. Monetary losses from property damage in Panama City Beach alone totaled about $50 million.

The first major storm to strike the region in 40 years, Hurricane Eloise did not directly kill anyone in the state of Florida. However, four deaths of an indirect nature were attributed to the hurricane; two of them were related to heart attacks. Numerous people sustained injuries, largely from broken glass or cleanup efforts. Overall property damage from the storm in Florida amounted to $150 million. In the storm's aftermath, a study of the hurricane's effect on aquatic animals living in the "swash zone" (the immediate area where land and the ocean meet) of Panama City Beach was conducted. The study concluded that compared to 11 consecutive months of data prior to the storm, the swash zone experienced a brief influx of animal species normally found offshore. However, the number decreased to near normal shortly thereafter. Also along the shore, the hurricane dismantled or severely impaired several piers, including the total destruction of a extension of the <a href="Okaloosa%20Island">Okaloosa Island</a> Pier built just three years earlier and part of its original span. A fishing pier at <a href="St.%20Andrews%20State%20Park">St. Andrews State Park</a> also suffered vast damage, along with another wooden pier at <a href="Mexico%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Mexico Beach</a> and the M.B. Miller Pier at Panama City Beach, which lost its end section to the storm.

As the hurricane progressed inland, it passed over eastern Alabama, generating strong winds. A gust of was recorded northeast of <a href="Ozark%2C%20Alabama">Ozark</a>. Winds elsewhere in the state ranged from around to . Precipitation in Alabama peaked at . The high winds resulted in severe damage to property and crops, amounting to $100 million. Eloise cut power and telephone service in the area, and in <a href="Geneva%20County%2C%20Alabama">Geneva County</a>, several people sustained storm-related injuries. As in Florida, the weakening hurricane spawned a number of tornadoes in Alabama and Georgia. Preliminary reports indicated that every county in southeastern Alabama received some damage from the storm. The strong winds uprooted trees and knocked down powerlines. Heavy rain associated with the storm caused a leak in the <a href="Alabama%20State%20Capitol">Alabama State Capitol</a> building roof. Gusty winds, moderate to heavy rainfall, and low pressures extended into Georgia, Louisiana, and to a lesser extent, <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>.
The remnants of Eloise interacted with another weather system, producing widespread precipitation across the Eastern United States, including portions of the <a href="Ohio%20Valley">Ohio Valley</a>, the <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20states">Mid-Atlantic states</a>, and <a href="New%20England">New England</a>. The deluge was "almost continuous" during the period between September 22 and 26 according to a statement by the National Weather Service. One of the highest rainfall totals in association with the storm occurred in <a href="Westminster%2C%20Maryland">Westminster, Maryland</a>, where of rain were recorded. Elsewhere, or more of precipitation fell throughout parts of <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> and <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>. At least 22 states received rainfall from Hurricane Eloise and its remnant moisture. Nearby <a href="Hurricane%20Faye">Hurricane Faye</a> may have also contributed to the heavy rainfall, although this connection was never confirmed. In <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, of rain contributed to the wettest September on record since 1934. The excessive rainfall led to extensive flooding throughout the region, in some areas exceeding 50- to 100-year levels.

Pennsylvania and New York bore the brunt of the flooding, which culminated in loss of life and severe property damage. Along the central <a href="Southern%20Tier">Southern Tier</a> region of New York, the storm damaged or destroyed over 700 structures. Flooding throughout the Northeastern United States disabled over a dozen water plants and at least 16 sewage treatment plants, prompting a <a href="boil-water%20advisory">boil-water advisory</a> in Pennsylvania's capital city of <a href="Harrisburg%2C%20Pennsylvania">Harrisburg</a>. Infrastructure further south also suffered; in <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>, the <a href="Monocacy%20River">Monocacy River</a>—a tributary of the <a href="Potomac%20River">Potomac</a>—swelled to above flood stage, inundating the city of <a href="Frederick%2C%20Maryland">Frederick</a> and compromising the city's supply of fresh drinking water. A final downpour of rain on the night of September 25–26 led to an additional of rain in central Maryland triggered severe flash flooding. In some cases, this onslaught affected the same areas that were still recovering from <a href="Hurricane%20Agnes">Hurricane Agnes</a> several years earlier, including <a href="Ellicott%20City%2C%20Maryland">Ellicott City</a>, <a href="Elkridge%2C%20Maryland">Elkridge</a>, and <a href="Laurel%2C%20Maryland">Laurel</a>, where two major rivers breached their banks and engulfed nearby areas. Many homes and businesses were lost, along with numerous vehicles; in the aftermath, looters entered on boats to access the devastated cities. The floodgates at the <a href="Rocky%20Gorge%20Reservoir">Rocky Gorge Dam</a> in Laurel were opened, forcing 500 residents downstream to leave their homes.

The consequences of the flooding rains were the worst seen in areas of the interior Mid-Atlantic states since Agnes, and comparisons were often drawn between the two hurricanes. In Pennsylvania alone, flooding from the remnants of Eloise forced 20,000 residents out of their homes; thousands further south in the Washington, D.C. area, where severe flooding impacted the city's southern suburbs, also fled to seek refuge. Further, many motorists throughout the region became stranded on highways inundated by floodwaters. <a href="Four%20Mile%20Run">Four Mile Run</a> and nearby streams overflowed and "tumbled through residential neighborhoods". Hundreds of families in the <a href="Alexandria%2C%20Virginia">Alexandria</a> and <a href="Arlington%2C%20Virginia">Arlington, Virginia</a> area suffered flood-related losses. Across the Northeastern U.S., the storm system killed 17 people and inflicted $300 million in damage. An instance of a storm-induced fatality is the death of a man in <a href="White%20Plains%2C%20New%20York">White Plains, New York</a>, who was killed by waters raging across the <a href="Hutchinson%20River%20Parkway">Hutchinson River Parkway</a>. Agriculturally, the extended period of wet weather threatened a range of crops, including the <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a> apple crop, of which 35% was feared to have been destroyed, and corn and sweet potato fields in <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>. With ground too moist for farm machinery to operate on, harvests were postponed.

After touring the disaster area, Florida Governor <a href="Reubin%20Askew">Reubin Askew</a> noted, "I think we're going to have to take a long, close look at some of the construction [...] Some of the structures simply won't be able to be built back in the exact location where they were." Governor Askew recruited 400 National Guard troops to prevent looting following the storm. He also requested the initial declaration of five counties along the Florida panhandle as national disaster areas, and stated that he would consider adding two more counties. The declaration would make residents in the counties recognized as disaster areas eligible to receive federal aid. Immediately following the storm, the mayor of Panama City criticized the state of Florida for failing to provide sufficient post-storm aid. Despite the destruction, the storm reportedly had some economic benefits; in the midst of rebuilding and recovery, business grew, especially in and around Panama City, and people began to move into the area. In at least one instance, the hurricane and its associated storm surge had a lasting effect on local geography, breaching Crooked Island in Bay County to create an inlet wide referred to as Eloise Inlet. Eloise provided a comprehensive base of information on beach and dune erosion along the Florida panhandle, which aided in the programming of certain erosion prediction <a href="numerical%20weather%20prediction">numerical models</a>. In 1995, reports from the aftermath of <a href="Hurricane%20Opal">Hurricane Opal</a> created a more extensive collection of data.

On September 26, President <a href="Gerald%20Ford">Gerald Ford</a> approved the declaration for Florida, and later issued a separate declaration for 30 counties in Pennsylvania as the storm's flooding rains progressed northward. Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governor <a href="Ernest%20Kline">Ernest Kline</a> assigned 600 National Guardsmen to assist in the evacuation of flood victims and maintain security in storm-ravaged areas. Over $430 million in federal disaster relief was spent overall in 1975 and distributed to 92,000 families; the bulk of the funds went to recovery for areas affected by Hurricane Eloise along its entire course. In Maryland, Governor <a href="Marvin%20Mandel">Marvin Mandel</a> placed 10 of the state's 23 counties under a state of emergency. Following the severe damage caused by Hurricane Eloise, its name was <a href="List%20of%20retired%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20names">retired</a> at the end of the 1975 season and will never again be used for a Atlantic hurricane. However, Eloise was not replaced by any particular name due to the addition of male names into the lists in 1979.

H. C. McNeile

Herman Cyril McNeile, <a href="Military%20Cross">MC</a> (28 September 1888 – 14 August 1937), commonly known as Cyril McNeile and publishing under the name H. C. McNeile or the pseudonym Sapper, was a British soldier and author. Drawing on his experiences in the trenches during the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>, he started writing short stories and getting them published in the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>". As serving officers in the British Army were not permitted to publish under their own names, he was given the <a href="pen%20name">pen name</a> "Sapper" by <a href="Alfred%20Harmsworth%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Northcliffe">Lord Northcliffe</a>, the owner of the "Daily Mail"; the nickname was based on that of his corps, the <a href="Royal%20Engineers">Royal Engineers</a>.

After the war McNeile left the army and continued writing, although he changed from war stories to <a href="Thriller%20%28genre%29">thrillers</a>. In 1920 he published <a href="Bulldog%20Drummond%20%28novel%29">"Bulldog Drummond"</a>, whose <a href="Bulldog%20Drummond">eponymous hero</a> became his best-known creation. The character was based on McNeile himself, on his friend <a href="Gerard%20Fairlie">Gerard Fairlie</a> and on English gentlemen generally. McNeile wrote ten Bulldog Drummond novels, as well as three plays and <a href="Bulldog%20Jack">a screenplay</a>.

McNeile interspersed his Drummond work with other <a href="List%20of%20works%20by%20H.%20C.%20McNeile">novels and story collections</a> that included two characters who appeared as protagonists in their own works, Jim Maitland and Ronald Standish. He was one of the most successful British popular authors of the <a href="Interwar%20period">inter-war period</a> before his death in 1937 from throat cancer, which has been attributed to damage sustained from a gas attack in the war.

McNeile's stories are either directly about the war, or contain people whose lives have been shaped by it. His thrillers are a continuation of his war stories, with <a href="upper%20class">upper class</a> Englishmen defending England from foreigners plotting against it. Although he was seen at the time as "simply an upstanding <a href="Tory">Tory</a> who spoke for many of his countrymen", after the Second World War his work was criticised as having <a href="Fascism">fascist</a> overtones, while also displaying the <a href="xenophobia">xenophobia</a> and <a href="Antisemitism">anti-semitism</a> apparent in some other writers of the period. 

McNeile was born in <a href="Bodmin">Bodmin</a>, <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>. He was the son of Malcolm McNeile, a <a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">captain</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> who at the time was governor of the <a href="Bodmin%20Gaol">naval prison</a> at Bodmin, and Christiana Mary (née Sloggett). The McNeile family had ancestral roots from both Belfast and Scotland, and counted a general in the <a href="British%20Indian%20Army">British Indian Army</a> among their members.

McNeile did not like either of his given names but preferred to be called Cyril, although he was always known by his friends as Mac. After attending a <a href="Preparatory%20school%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">prep school</a> in <a href="Eastbourne">Eastbourne</a>, he was further educated at <a href="Cheltenham%20College">Cheltenham College</a>. On leaving the college, he joined the <a href="Royal%20Military%20Academy%2C%20Woolwich">Royal Military Academy, Woolwich</a>, from which he was commissioned into the <a href="Royal%20Engineers">Royal Engineers</a> as a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in July 1907. He underwent further training at the <a href="Royal%20School%20of%20Military%20Engineering">Royal School of Military Engineering</a> before a short posting to <a href="Aldershot%20Garrison">Aldershot Garrison</a>. He received promotion to <a href="Lieutenant%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29">lieutenant</a> in June 1910 and was posted to <a href="Canterbury">Canterbury</a>, serving three years with the 3rd Field Troop, until January 1914, when he was posted to Malta.

In 1914 McNeile was promoted to the rank of <a href="Captain%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29">captain</a>. He was still in Malta when the war broke out and was ordered to France in October 1914; he travelled via England and married Violet Evelyn Baird on 31 October 1914. Baird was the daughter of <a href="Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Lieutenant-Colonel</a> Arthur Baird Douglas of the <a href="Queen%27s%20Own%20Cameron%20Highlanders">Cameron Highlanders</a>.

On 2 November 1914 McNeile travelled to France as part of the <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20I%29">British Expeditionary Force</a>. Few details are known about McNeile's wartime service, as his records were <a href="The%20National%20Archives%20%28United%20Kingdom%29%23Access%20to%20documents">destroyed by incendiary bombs</a> during the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>. He spent time with a number of Royal Engineer units on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>, including 1st Field Squadron RE, 15th Field Company RE and RE elements of the <a href="33rd%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">33rd Division</a>.
McNeile's first known published story, "Reminiscences of Sergeant Michael Cassidy", was serialised on page four of the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" from 13 January 1915. As serving officers in the British Army were not permitted to publish under their own names except during their <a href="Half-pay">half-pay sabbaticals</a>, many would write under a pseudonym; <a href="Alfred%20Harmsworth%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Northcliffe">Lord Northcliffe</a>, the owner of the "Daily Mail", gave McNeile the pen name "Sapper", as the Royal Engineers were commonly known as the <a href="Sapper">Sapper</a>s. McNeile later confided that he had started writing through "sheer boredom". Some of his stories appeared on page four of the "Daily Mail" over the following months. Northcliffe was impressed by his writing and attempted, but failed, to have him released from the army to work as a war correspondent. By the end of 1915, he had written two collections of short stories, "The Lieutenant and Others" and "Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E.", both of which were published by <a href="Hodder%20%26amp%3B%20Stoughton">Hodder & Stoughton</a>. Although many of the stories had already appeared in the "Daily Mail", between 1916 and 1918 "Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E." sold 135,000 copies and "The Lieutenant and Others" sold 139,000 copies. By the end of the war he had published three more collections, "Men, Women, and Guns" (1916), "No Man's Land" (1917) and "The Human Touch" (1918). In 1916 he wrote a series of articles titled "The Making of an Officer", which appeared under the initials C. N., in five issues of "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" between 8 and 14 June 1916. The articles were aimed at young and new officers to explain their duties to them; these were collected together and published by Hodder & Stoughton later in 1916.

During his time with the Royal Engineers, McNeile saw action at the First and Second Battles of Ypres—he was <a href="Chemical%20warfare">gassed</a> at the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Ypres">second battle</a>—and the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme">Battle of the Somme</a>. In 1916 he was awarded the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a> and was <a href="mentioned%20in%20dispatches">mentioned in dispatches</a>; in November that year he was <a href="gazetted">gazetted</a> to acting <a href="Major%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">major</a>. From 1 April to 5 October 1918, he commanded a battalion of the <a href="Middlesex%20Regiment">Middlesex Regiment</a> and was promoted to acting lieutenant-colonel; the scholar Lawrence Treadwell observes that "for an engineer to command an infantry regiment was ... a rarity". 18th Battalion, <a href="Middlesex%20Regiment">Middlesex Regiment</a> under McNeile saw action for the remainder of his command, and were involved in fighting during the <a href="Hundred%20Days%20Offensive">Hundred Days Offensive</a> in the St. Quentin-Cambrai sector in September 1918; during the year, he was again mentioned in dispatches. On 2 October 1918 he broke his ankle and was briefly hospitalised, which forced him to relinquish his command of the regiment on 4 October. He was on convalescent leave when the war ended in November 1918. During the course of the war, he had spent a total of 32 months in France, and had probably been gassed more than once. His literary output from 1915 to 1918 accounted for more than 80 collected and uncollected stories. His brother—also in the Royal Engineers—had been killed earlier in the war.

McNeile had a quiet life after the war; his biographer <a href="Jonathon%20Green">Jonathon Green</a> notes that "as in the novels of fellow best-selling writers such as <a href="P.%20G.%20Wodehouse">P. G. Wodehouse</a> or <a href="Agatha%20Christie">Agatha Christie</a>, it is the hero who lives the exciting life". Although he was an "unremittingly hearty man", he suffered from delicate health following the war. He had a loud voice and a louder laugh, and "liked to enliven clubs and restaurants with the sight and sound of military good fellowship"; his friend and collaborator Gerard Fairlie described him as "not everybody's cup of tea", and commented that "he was loud in every possible way—in his voice, in his laugh, in his clothes, in the unconscious swagger with which he always motivated himself, in his whole approach to life". McNeile and his wife had two sons.

On 13 June 1919 McNeile retired onto the reserve officer list and was confirmed in the rank of major. The same year he also published a short-story collection, "Mufti", in which he introduced a type of character as "the Breed", a class of Englishman who was patriotic, loyal and "physically and morally intrepid". Although well received by the critics, the book failed commercially and, by the end of 1922, had only sold 16,700 copies from its first print run of 20,000; the unsold copies were pulped and the novel went out of print later that year.

In 1920 McNeile published "<a href="Bulldog%20Drummond%20%28novel%29">Bull-Dog Drummond</a>", whose <a href="Bulldog%20Drummond">eponymous hero</a>—a member of "the Breed"—became his most famous creation. He had first written Drummond as a detective for a short story in "<a href="The%20Strand%20Magazine">The Strand Magazine</a>", but the character was not successful and was changed for the novel, which was a <a href="Thriller%20%28genre%29">thriller</a>. Captain Hugh "Bulldog" Drummond <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">DSO</a>, MC was described in the novel's sub-title as "a demobilised officer who found peace dull" after service during the First World War with the fictional <a href="Loamshire%20Regiment">Loamshire Regiment</a>. Drummond went on to appear in ten full-length novels by McNeile and a further seven by his friend <a href="Gerard%20Fairlie">Gerard Fairlie</a>. The character was an amalgam of Fairlie, himself, and his idea of an English gentleman. Drummond also had roots in the literary characters <a href="Sherlock%20Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a>, <a href="Sexton%20Blake">Sexton Blake</a>, <a href="Richard%20Hannay">Richard Hannay</a> and <a href="The%20Scarlet%20Pimpernel">The Scarlet Pimpernel</a>. Drummond was characterised as large, very strong, physically unattractive and an "apparently brainless hunk of a man", who was also a gentleman with a private income; he could also be construed as "a brutalized ex-officer whose thirst for excitement is also an attempt to reenact the war". The character was later described by <a href="Cecil%20Day-Lewis">Cecil Day-Lewis</a>, author of rival gentleman detective <a href="Nigel%20Strangeways">Nigel Strangeways</a>, as an "unspeakable public school bully". Drummond's main adversary across four novels is Carl Peterson, a master criminal with no national allegiance, who is often accompanied by his wife, Irma. Irma is described by Jonathon Green as "the slinky epitome of a twenties '<a href="femme%20fatale">vamp</a>, and by Lawrence Treadwell as dark, sexy and from an oriental background, "a true "femme fatale"". After Carl Peterson's death in "The Final Count", Irma swears revenge on Drummond and kidnaps his wife—whom he had met in "Bull-Dog Drummond"—with the intent of killing him in the ensuing chase. Irma Peterson appears in six of McNeile's books, and in a further five by Fairlie.

McNeile adapted "Bulldog Drummond" for the stage. It was produced at <a href="Wyndham%27s%20Theatre">Wyndham's Theatre</a> during the 1921–22 season, with <a href="Gerald%20du%20Maurier">Gerald du Maurier</a> playing the title role; it ran for 428 performances. The play also ran in New York during the same season, with <a href="A.%20E.%20Matthews">A. E. Matthews</a> as Drummond. Later in 1922 McNeile resigned his reserve commission with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, and moved as a <a href="tax%20exile">tax exile</a> to <a href="Territet">Territet</a>, <a href="Montreux">Montreux</a>, Switzerland, with his wife; the Swiss countryside was later described in a number of his stories.

The following year McNeile introduced the character of Jim Maitland, a "footloose sahib of the period". Maitland was the protagonist of the 1923 novel "Jim Maitland"; he later appeared in a second novel in 1931, "The Island of Terror". Around the time McNeile killed off the Carl Peterson character in "The Final Count" (1926), he also introduced the character Ronald Standish, who first appeared in "The Saving Clause" (1927) and "Tiny Carteret" (1930) before becoming the protagonist in two collections of short stories, "Ronald Standish" (1933) and "Ask for Ronald Standish" (1936). The character also appeared in the final three Drummond novels, "Knock-Out" (1933), "Bull-Dog Drummond at Bay" (1935) and "Challenge" (1937). Standish was a sportsman who played cricket for England and was a part-time consultant with the <a href="War%20Office">War Office</a>.

In 1929 McNeile edited a volume of short stories from <a href="O.%20Henry">O. Henry</a>, "The Best of O. Henry"; the stories had served as models for him when he had started as a writer. The same year, the film <a href="Bulldog%20Drummond%20%281929%20film%29">"Bulldog Drummond"</a> was released, starring <a href="Ronald%20Colman">Ronald Colman</a> in the title role. Colman was nominated for an <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a> for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Best Actor</a> at the <a href="3rd%20Academy%20Awards">3rd Academy Awards</a> ceremony. The film earned $750,000 at the box office, and McNeile received an estimated £5,000 for the rights to his novel. The same year he wrote his second play—"The Way Out"—which was staged at the <a href="Harold%20Pinter%20Theatre">Comedy Theatre</a> in January 1930. About a year later he and his wife returned to England, and settled near <a href="Pulborough">Pulborough</a>, West Sussex.

In 1935 McNeile, Fairlie, <a href="Sidney%20Gilliat">Sidney Gilliat</a> and <a href="J.O.C.%20Orton">J.O.C. Orton</a> collaborated on the screenplay "<a href="Bulldog%20Jack">Bulldog Jack</a>", a "comedy thriller" with <a href="Jack%20Hulbert">Jack Hulbert</a> and <a href="Fay%20Wray">Fay Wray</a>, which was produced by <a href="Gaumont%20British">Gaumont British</a>.

In 1937 McNeile was working with Fairlie on the play "Bulldog Drummond Hits Out" when he was diagnosed with terminal throat cancer. He came to an agreement with Fairlie for the play to continue after his death and for Fairlie to continue writing the Drummond stories. McNeile died on 14 August 1937 at his home in <a href="West%20Chiltington">West Chiltington</a>, West Sussex. Although most sources identify throat cancer as the cause of death, Treadwell also suggests that it may have been lung cancer. It was "traceable to his war service", and attributed to a gas attack. His funeral, with full military honours, was conducted at <a href="Woking">Woking</a> crematorium. At his death his estate was valued at over £26,000.

"Bulldog Drummond Hits Out" was finished by Fairlie and had a short tour of Brighton, Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh, before opening in London at the <a href="Savoy%20Theatre">Savoy Theatre</a> on 21 December 1937. The story was later turned into a novel by Fairlie, with the title "Bulldog Drummond on Dartmoor". Fairlie continued to write Drummond novels, seven in total.

Drummond, McNeile's chief literary legacy, became a model for other literary heroes created in the 1940s and '50s. <a href="W.%20E.%20Johns">W. E. Johns</a> used McNeile's work as a model for his character <a href="Biggles">Biggles</a>, while <a href="Ian%20Fleming">Ian Fleming</a> admitted that <a href="James%20Bond%20%28literary%20character%29">James Bond</a> was "Sapper from the waist up and <a href="Mickey%20Spillane">Mickey Spillane</a> below". <a href="Sydney%20Horler">Sydney Horler</a>'s popular character "Tiger" Standish was also modelled on Drummond.

McNeile's works fall into two distinct phases. Those works published between 1915 and 1918 are his war stories, and relate directly to his experiences during the First World War, while the later works are largely thrillers. His war stories were marketed by the "Daily Mail" and Hodder & Stoughton as a soldier's eyewitness accounts. When he started writing thrillers, Hodder & Stoughton advertised McNeile as a "light and entertaining" writer, and began publishing his works in the "Yellow Jacket" series. Magazine editors competed vigorously for Sapper's stories and paid extravagant prices for them. Gerald Fairlie, his close friend and collaborator, has put it on record that Sapper was the highest-paid short story writer of his time.

McNeile's early works, the war stories published before 1919, are either "plot-driven adventure narrative[s]", such as the short stories "The Song of the Bayonet" and "Private Meyrick, Company Idiot", or "atmospheric vignette[s]", such as "The Land of Topsy Turvy" and "The Human Touch". McNeile would write about 1,000 words every morning in a routine that was rarely disturbed; he took no breaks while writing and would do no re-writes until he completed his work. The academic Jessica Meyer has criticised his style as having "little aesthetic merit, being stylised, clichéd and often repetitive"; <a href="Richard%20Usborne">Richard Usborne</a> agreed, adding that the female characters were "cardboard" and that McNeile was "wonderfully forgetful" about characters dead in one book and alive in the next. In the Bulldog Drummond stories, Watson identifies the central character as "a melodramatic creation, workable only within a setting of melodrama". The academic Joan DelFattore points out that while the characters and plots cannot be considered to be unique, credible or well-rounded, his books "make no claim to literary excellence", and are instead, "good, solid thrillers". Usborne agrees, and believes that McNeile wrote good stories that were flawed but well told. Meyer classifies the non-war stories as <a href="middlebrow">middlebrow</a>, with "sentimental plotlines and presenting a social message about the condition of England". His early novels, particularly "Bull-Dog Drummond" and "The Black Gang", were structured loosely and in some ways as short stories. The academic Hans Bertens blamed this on McNeile's lack of experience and self-confidence, noting that in his later novels, McNeile "mastered the tricks of his trade".

DelFattore outlines the use of double adjectives to reinforce feelings towards enemies in both his war stories and thrillers, such as "filthy, murdering Boche", and "stinking, cowardly Bolshevik". She and the scholar Lise Jaillant also comment on the dehumanisation of the enemy, comparing them to animals and vermin. Watson noted the frequency of the use of the word "devil"—and variations—when discussing antagonists.

The major theme running throughout McNeile's works is the First World War. Between 1915 and 1918 he had five collections of short stories published about the war, while his post-war fiction can be seen as an extension of those stories, as "both treat the war as a trial with manhood at stake". His war stories were considered by contemporary audiences as anti-sentimental, realistic depictions of the trenches, and as a "celebration of the qualities of the <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Old Contemptibles</a>". McNeile's view, as expressed through his writing, was that war was a purposeful activity for the nation and for individuals, even if that purpose was later wasted: a "valuable chance at national renewal that had been squandered". The positive effects of war on the individual were outlined by McNeile in "The Making of an Officer", his series of articles in "The Times", in which he wrote about "the qualities of leadership and selflessness essential to 'inspire' subalterns", a theme he returned to in his war stories—particularly "The Lieutenant and Others" and "Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E"—and then afterwards in his fictional stories, notably the Bulldog Drummond works.

McNeile's fictional work—particularly his Drummond series of books—shows characters who have served in the war and have been affected by it; Jaillant comments that Drummond's war-time experience "has shaped his social identity, his skills, and even his physical appearance". The Drummond character has been "brutalized by war", which accounts for his physical approach when dealing with Peterson and others.

McNeile provided Drummond with a "flamboyantly aggressive patriotism" towards England, which Drummond defends physically against those who challenge its stability or morality. Hans Bertens argued that the patriotism demonstrated by Drummond was closer to nationalistic pride and a paranoia about threats directed at the upper middle classes, of which Drummond was a member. Drummond's nickname—Bulldog—is symbolic of England, and he and his English gentlemen friends—"the Breed"—fight the conspiracy of foreigners threatening England's stability. McNeile's thriller stories do not often pit Englishman against Englishman as the main characters; most of the foreigners in his books are the villains.

Running throughout McNeile's books is the metaphor of warfare as sport. His war stories include descriptions of fights between individuals that carry a sporting motif: in "Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E.", he writes, "To bag a man with a gun is one thing; there is sport—there is an element of one against one, like when the quality goes big game shooting. But to bag twenty men by a mine has not the same feeling at all, even if they are Germans". The motif was continued into the Drummond novels. McNeile reinforces this theme through his use of the language of public school sports, or of boxing, poker or hunting. The titles of his books also use sporting imagery: "The Third Round", "The Final Count", "Knock-Out" and "Challenge".

McNeile's war story collections sold well; nearly 50,000 copies of his first book, "Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E.", were purchased in its first year, and nearly 58,000 copies the following year. His thrillers were also popular, with "Bulldog Drummond" selling 396,302 copies between 1920 and 1939, exceeding the 100,000-copies benchmark for "best-sellers". At his peak in the 1920s, he was the highest paid short story writer in the world, and it was estimated that in the last five years of his life he was earning around £10,000 a year; the "<a href="Daily%20Mirror">Daily Mirror</a>" estimated that during his writing career he had earned £85,000.
McNeile's war stories were seen by reviewers as honest portrayals of the war, with British and American reviewers in the mainstream press praising his realism and avoidance of sentimentality in dealing with his subject matter. Reviewing "Men, Women, and Guns" for "<a href="The%20Times%20Literary%20Supplement">The Times Literary Supplement</a>", Francis Henry Gribble wrote that "Sapper has been successful in previous volumes of war stories ... When the time comes for picking out the writers whose war fiction has permanent value, his claim to be included in the list will call for serious examination." The reviewer of "Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E." for "<a href="The%20Atlanta%20Journal-Constitution">The Atlanta Constitution</a>" reminded its readers that McNeile "has been called the foremost literary genius of the British army." Jaillant observes that once McNeile moved from war stories to thrillers, with the concurrent re-positioning of advertising and marketing by Hodder & Stoughton, the reviewers also treated him differently, and presented him as "a writer of thrillers, without any pretension to literary seriousness". When reviewing "Bulldog Drummond Strikes Back" for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", the critic observed that "if you like a good knock-down-and-drag-out yarn with excitement and violence on nearly every page, you can't go wrong on Bulldog Drummond"; for the novel "Bulldog Drummond at Bay", the reviewer considered that "as a piece of fictional melodrama, the book is first rate". In the British market, "The Times Literary Supplement" also characterised him as a mass-market thriller writer, which contrasted with its consideration of his earlier works.

From the 1950s on, McNeile's work came to be viewed in the light of events of the Second World War, and journalists such as Richard Usborne highlighted aspects of the stories which he considered were "carrying the <a href="F%C3%BChrerprinzip">Führer-principle</a>". DelFattore agrees, and considers that the second Bulldog Drummond novel—"The Black Gang" (1922)—is when the <a href="Fascism">fascist</a> element was introduced. Jaillant notes that the accusations of fascism only came about after the Second World War, while the academic <a href="Ion%20Trewin">Ion Trewin</a> considers that through the Drummond stories, McNeile was seen at the time as "simply an upstanding Tory who spoke for many of his countrymen".

Throughout the Drummond stories, much of the language used by McNeile's characters relating to ethnic minorities or Jews is considered by DelFattore to be "intensely conservative by modern standards"; Green observes that while the characters of other contemporary writers, such as <a href="Agatha%20Christie">Agatha Christie</a>, "exhibit the inevitable <a href="xenophobia">xenophobia</a> and <a href="Antisemitism">anti-semitism</a> of the period, McNeile's go far beyond the 'polite' norms". J. D. Bourn considers his language to be "rather distasteful", while the academic <a href="Michael%20Denning">Michael Denning</a> observed that "Drummond is a bundle of <a href="chauvinism">chauvinism</a>s, hating Jews, Germans, and most other foreigners".

Battle of Arras (1917)

The Battle of Arras (also known as the Second Battle of Arras) was a <a href="British%20Empire">British</a> offensive on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. From 9 April to 16 May 1917, British troops attacked <a href="German%20Empire">German</a> defences near the <a href="French%20Third%20Republic">French</a> city of <a href="Arras">Arras</a> on the Western Front. The British achieved the longest advance since trench warfare had begun, surpassing the record set by the French Sixth Army on 1 July 1916. The British advance slowed in the next few days and the German defence recovered. The battle became a costly stalemate for both sides and by the end of the battle, the British Third and First Armies had suffered about 160,000 and the German 6th Army about 125,000 casualties.

For much of the war, the opposing armies on the Western Front were at stalemate, with a continuous line of <a href="Trench%20warfare">trenches</a> from the Belgian coast to the <a href="France-Switzerland%20border">Swiss border</a>. The <a href="Allies%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Allied</a> objective from early 1915 was to break through the German defences into the open ground beyond and engage the numerically inferior <a href="German%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">German Army</a> ("Westheer") in a <a href="Maneuver%20warfare">war of movement</a>. The British attack at Arras was part of the French <a href="Nivelle%20Offensive">Nivelle Offensive</a>, the main part of which was to take place on the Aisne to the south. The aim of the French offensive was to break through the German defences in forty-eight hours. At Arras the Canadians were to re-capture <a href="Vimy%20Ridge">Vimy Ridge</a>, dominating the plain of Douai to the east, advance towards Cambrai and divert German reserves from the French front.

The British effort was an assault on a relatively broad front between <a href="Vimy">Vimy</a> in the north-west and <a href="Bullecourt">Bullecourt</a> to the south-east. After a long preparatory bombardment, the <a href="Canadian%20Corps">Canadian Corps</a> of the First Army in the north fought the <a href="Battle%20of%20Vimy%20Ridge">Battle of Vimy Ridge</a> and took the ridge. The Third Army in the centre advanced astride the <a href="Scarpe%20River">Scarpe River</a> and in the south, the Fifth Army attacked the <a href="Hindenburg%20Line">Hindenburg Line</a> ("Siegfriedstellung") but was frustrated by the <a href="defence%20in%20depth">defence in depth</a> and made few gains. The British armies then engaged in a series of small operations to consolidate the new positions. Although these battles were generally successful in achieving limited aims, they came at considerable cost.

When the battle officially ended on 16 May, British Empire troops had made significant advances but had been unable to achieve a <a href="breakthrough%20%28military%29">breakthrough</a>. New tactics and the equipment to exploit them had been used, showing that the British had absorbed the lessons of the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme">Battle of the Somme</a> and could mount set-piece attacks against fortified field defences. After the Second Battle of Bullecourt (3–17 May), the Arras sector returned to the <a href="stalemate">stalemate</a> that typified most of the war on the Western Front, except for attacks on the Hindenburg Line and around Lens, culminating in the Canadian <a href="Battle%20of%20Hill%2070">Battle of Hill 70</a> (15–25 August).
At the beginning of 1917, the British and French were still searching for a way to achieve a strategic breakthrough on the Western Front. The previous year had been marked by the costly success of the Anglo-French offensive astride the <a href="Somme%20%28river%29">River Somme</a>, while the French had been unable to take the initiative because of intense German pressure at <a href="Verdun">Verdun</a> until after August 1916. The battles consumed enormous quantities of resources while achieving virtually no strategic gains on the battlefield. The cost to Germany of containing the Anglo-French attacks had been enormous and given that the material preponderance of the Entente and its allies could only be expected to increase in 1917, Hindenburg and Ludendorff decided on a defensive strategy on the Western Front for that year. This impasse reinforced the French and British commanders' belief that to end the stalemate they needed a breakthrough; while this desire may have been the main impetus behind the offensive, the timing and location were influenced by political and tactical considerations.

The mid-war years were momentous times. Governing politicians in Paris and London were under great pressure from the press, the people and their parliaments to win the war. Hundreds of thousands of casualties had been suffered at the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Gallipoli">Gallipoli</a>, the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme">Somme</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Verdun">Verdun</a>, with little prospect of victory in sight. The <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British Prime Minister</a>, <a href="H.%20H.%20Asquith">H. H. Asquith</a>, resigned in early December 1916 and was succeeded by <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a>. In France, <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20France">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Aristide%20Briand">Aristide Briand</a>, along with <a href="Minister%20of%20Defence%20%28France%29">Minister of Defence</a> <a href="Hubert%20Lyautey">Hubert Lyautey</a> were politically diminished and resigned in March 1917, following disagreements over the prospective <a href="Nivelle%20Offensive">Nivelle Offensive</a>. The United States was close to declaring war on Germany; American public opinion was growing increasingly incensed by U-boat attacks upon civilian shipping, starting with the sinking of in 1915 and culminating in the torpedoing of seven American merchantmen in early 1917. The <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> finally <a href="United%20States%20declaration%20of%20war%20upon%20Germany%20%281917%29">declared war</a> on <a href="German%20Empire">Imperial Germany</a> on 6 April 1917 but it would be more than a year before a suitable army could be raised, trained and transported to France.

Although the French and British had intended to launch a spring offensive in 1917, the strategy was threatened in February, when the <a href="Russia">Russia</a>ns admitted that they could not meet the commitment to a joint offensive, which reduced the two-front offensive to a French assault along the <a href="Aisne%20%28river%29">Aisne River</a>. In March, the German army in the west (), withdrew to the <a href="Hindenburg%20Line">Hindenburg line</a> in <a href="Alberich%20%28World%20War%20I%20German%20operation%29">Operation Alberich</a>, which negated the tactical assumptions underlying the plans for the French offensive. Until French troops advanced to compensate during the Battles of Arras, they encountered no German troops in the assault sector and it became uncertain whether the offensive would go forward. The French government desperately needed a victory to avoid civil unrest but the British were wary of proceeding, in view of the rapidly changing tactical situation. In a meeting with Lloyd George, French commander-in-chief General <a href="Robert%20Nivelle">Robert Nivelle</a> persuaded the British Prime Minister, that if the British launched a diversionary assault to draw German troops away from the Aisne sector, the French offensive could succeed. It was agreed in the London Convention of 16 January, that the French assault on the Aisne would begin in mid-April and that the British would make a diversionary attack in the Arras sector approximately one week prior.

Three armies of <a href="Field%20marshal%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Field Marshal</a> <a href="Douglas%20Haig%2C%201st%20Earl%20Haig">Sir Douglas Haig</a>, the commander of the <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20I%29">British Expeditionary Force</a> (BEF) were in the Arras sector, the <a href="Fifth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Fifth Army</a> (General <a href="Hubert%20Gough">Hubert Gough</a>) in the south, the <a href="Third%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Third Army</a> (General <a href="Edmund%20Allenby%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Allenby">Edmund Allenby</a>) in the centre and the <a href="First%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">First Army</a> (General <a href="Henry%20Horne%2C%201st%20Baron%20Horne">Henry Horne</a>) in the north and the plan was devised by Allenby. The British used the lessons of the Somme and Verdun the previous year and planned to attack attacking on an , from Vimy Ridge in the north to Neuville Vitasse, south of the Scarpe river. The preliminary bombardment was planned to last about a week at all points on the line, with a much longer and heavier barrage at Vimy Ridge.

In December 1916, the training manual replaced of 8 May 1916 and marked a significant step in the evolution of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) into a homogeneous force, well adapted to its role on the Western Front. The duties of army, corps and divisions in planning attacks were standardised. Armies were to devise the plan and the principles of the artillery component. The corps were to allot tasks to divisions, which would then select objectives and devise infantry plans subject to corps approval. Artillery planning was controlled by corps with consultation of divisions by the corps General Officer Commanding, Royal Artillery (GOCRA) which became the title of the officer at each level of command who devised the bombardment plan, which was coordinated with neighbouring corps artillery commanders by the army GOCRA. Specific parts of the bombardment were nominated by divisions, using their local knowledge and the results of air reconnaissance. The corps artillery commander was to co-ordinate counter-battery fire and the howitzer bombardment for zero hour. Corps controlled the <a href="creeping%20barrage">creeping barrage</a> but divisions were given authority over extra batteries added to the barrage, which could be switched to other targets by the divisional commander and brigade commanders. provided the basis for the operational technique of the BEF for the rest of 1917.

The training manual of February 1917 marked the end of attacks made by lines of infantry with a few detached specialists. The platoon was divided into a small headquarters and four sections, one with two trained grenade-throwers and assistants, the second with a Lewis gunner and nine assistants carrying of ammunition, the third section comprised a sniper, scout and nine riflemen and the fourth section had nine men with four rifle-grenade launchers. The rifle and hand-grenade sections were to advance in front of the Lewis-gun and rifle-grenade sections, in two waves or in "artillery formation", which covered an area wide and deep, with the four sections in a diamond pattern, the rifle section ahead, rifle grenade and bombing sections to the sides and the Lewis gun section behind, until resistance was met. German defenders were to be suppressed by fire from the Lewis-gun and rifle-grenade sections, while the riflemen and hand-grenade sections moved forward, preferably by infiltrating around the flanks of the resistance, to overwhelm the defenders from the rear.

The changes in equipment, organisation and formation were elaborated in "The Normal Formation For the Attack" of February 1917, which recommended that the leading troops should push on to the final objective, when only one or two were involved but that for a greater number of objectives, when artillery covering fire was available for the depth of the intended advance, fresh platoons should "leap-frog" through the leading platoons to the next objective. The new organisations and equipment gave the infantry platoon the capacity for fire and manoeuvre, even in the absence of adequate artillery support. To bring uniformity in adoption of the methods laid down in the revised manuals and others produced over the winter, Haig established a BEF Training Directorate in January 1917, to issue manuals and oversee training. and its companion manuals like provided British infantry with "off-the-peg" tactics, devised from the experience of the Somme and from French Army operations, to go with the new equipment made available by increasing British and Allied war production and better understanding of the organisation necessary to exploit it in battle.

In a new manual of 1 December 1916, (Principles of Command for Defensive Battles in Positional Warfare), the policy of unyielding defence of ground regardless of its tactical value, was replaced by the defence of positions suitable for artillery observation and communication with the rear, where an attacking force would ""fight itself to a standstill and use up its resources while the defenders conserve[d] their strength"". Defending infantry would fight in areas, with the front divisions in an outpost zone up to deep behind listening posts, with the main line of resistance placed on a reverse slope, in front of artillery observation posts, which were kept far enough back to retain observation over the outpost zone. Behind the main line of resistance was a (battle zone), a second defensive area deep as far as possible on ground hidden from enemy observation, while in view of German artillery observers. A (rear battle zone) further back was to be occupied by the reserve battalion of each regiment.

Given the growing Allied superiority in munitions and manpower, attackers might still penetrate to the second (artillery protection) line, leaving in their wake German garrisons isolated in , (resistance nests, ) still inflicting losses and disorganisation on the attackers. As the attackers tried to capture the and dig in near the German second line, and of the counter-attack divisions would advance from the into the battle zone, in an immediate counter-attack (). If the immediate counter-attack failed, the counter-attack divisions would take their time to prepare a methodical attack, provided the lost ground was essential to the retention of the main position. Such methods required large numbers of reserve divisions ready to move to the battlefront. The reserve was obtained by creating by internal reorganisation of the army, bringing divisions from the eastern front and by shortening the Western Front, in <a href="Operation%20Alberich">Operation Alberich</a>. By the spring of 1917, the German army in the west had a strategic reserve of 

"Experience of the German 1st Army in the Somme Battles", ("Erfahrungen der I Armee in der Sommeschlacht") was published on 30 January 1917 by Ludendorff but new defensive methods were controversial. During the Battle of the Somme in 1916 Colonel <a href="Fritz%20von%20Lo%C3%9Fberg">Fritz von Loßberg</a> (Chief of Staff of the <a href="1st%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">1st Army</a>) had been able to establish a line of "relief" divisions (), with the reinforcements from Verdun, which began to arrive in greater numbers in September. In his analysis of the battle, Loßberg opposed the granting of discretion to front trench garrisons to retire, as he believed that manoeuvre would not evade Allied artillery fire, which could blanket the forward area and invited French or British infantry to occupy vacant areas. Loßberg considered that spontaneous withdrawals would disrupt the counter-attack reserves as they deployed and further deprive battalion and division commanders of the meand to conduct an organised defence, which the dispersal of infantry over a wide area had already made difficult. Loßberg and others had severe doubts as to the ability of relief divisions to arrive on the battlefield in time to conduct an immediate counter-attack () from behind the battle zone. Sceptics wanted the tactic of fighting in the front line to continue, with authority devolved no further than battalion, to maintain organizational coherence in anticipation of a methodical counter-attack () by the relief divisions after Ludendorff was sufficiently impressed by Loßberg's memorandum to add it to the new "Manual of Infantry Training for War".

General <a href="Ludwig%20von%20Falkenhausen">Ludwig von Falkenhausen</a>, commander of the <a href="6th%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">6th Army</a> arranged the infantry at Arras for the rigid defence of the front-line, supported by methodical counter-attacks (), by the "relief" divisions () on the second or third day. Five were placed behind <a href="Douai">Douai</a>, away from the front line. The new Hindenburg line ended at Telegraph Hill between <a href="Neuville-Vitasse">Neuville-Vitasse</a> and Tilloy lez Mofflaines, from whence the original system of four lines apart, ran north to the <a href="Neuville-Saint-Vaast">Neuville St. Vaast</a>–<a href="Bailleul-aux-Cornailles">Bailleul-aux-Cornailles</a> road. About behind were the <a href="Wancourt">Wancourt</a>–<a href="Feuchy">Feuchy</a> and to the north the Point du Jour lines, running from the <a href="Scarpe%20%28river%29">Scarpe</a> river north along the east slope of <a href="Vimy">Vimy</a> ridge. The new "Wotan" line, which extended the Hindenburg position, was built around further back and not entirely mapped by the Allies until the battle had begun.

Just before the battle, Falkenhausen had written that parts of the front line might be lost but the five could be brought forward to relieve the front divisions on the evening of the second day. On 6 April, General Karl von Nagel, the 6th Army Chief of Staff, accepted that some of the front divisions might need to be relieved on the first evening of battle but that any penetrations would be repulsed with local immediate counter-attacks () by the front divisions. On 7 April, Nagel viewed the imminent British attack as a limited effort against Vimy ridge, preparatory to a bigger attack later, perhaps combined with the French attack expected in mid-April. Construction of positions to fulfil the new policy of area defence had been drastically curtailed by shortages of labour and the long winter, which affected the setting of concrete. The 6th Army commanders had also been reluctant to encourage the British to change their plans if the British detected a thinning of the front line. The Germans were inhibited by the extent of British air reconnaissance, which observed new field works and promptly directed artillery fire on them. The 6th Army failed to redeploy its artillery, which remained in lines easy to see and bombard. Work on defences was also divided between maintaining the front line, strengthening the third line and the new (<a href="Drocourt-Qu%C3%A9ant%20line">Drocourt–Quéant switch line</a>) further back.

After the Allied conference at Chantilly, Haig issued instructions for army commanders on 17 November 1916, with a general plan for offensive operations in the spring of 1917. The Chief engineer of the Third Army, Major-General E. R. Kenyon, composed a list of requirements by 19 November, for which he had 16 Army Troops companies, five with each corps in the front line and one with XVIII Corps, four tunnelling companies, three entrenching battalions, eight RE labour battalions and 37 labour companies. Inside the old walls of Arras were the Grand and Petit places, under which there were old cellars, which were emptied and refurbished for the accommodation of 13,000 men. Under the suburbs of St Sauveur and Ronville were many caves, some huge, which were rediscovered by accident in October 1916. When cleared out the caves had room for 11,500 men, one in the Ronville system housing 4,000 men. The Crinchon sewer followed the ditch of the old fortifications and tunnels were dug from the cellars to the sewer.

Two long tunnels were excavated from the Crinchon sewer, one through the St Sauveur and one through the Ronville system, allowing the 24,500 troops safely sheltered from German bombardment to move forward underground, avoiding the railway station, an obvious target for bombardment. The St Sauveur tunnel followed the line of the road to Cambrai and had five shafts in no man's land but the German retirement to the Hindenburg Line forestalled the use of the Ronville tunnels, when the German front line was withdrawn and there was no time to extend the diggings. The subterranean workings were lit by electricity and supplied by piped water, with gas-proof doors at the entrances; telephone cables, exchanges and testing-points used the tunnels, a hospital was installed and a tram ran from the sewer to the St Sauveur caves. The observation post for the VI Corps heavy artillery off the St Sauveur tunnel, had a telephone exchange with 750 circuits; much of the work in this area being done by the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Tunnelling%20Company">New Zealand Tunnelling Company</a>.

On the First Army front German sappers also conducted underground operations, seeking out Allied tunnels to assault and <a href="counter-mine">counter-mine</a>, in which 41 New Zealand tunnellers were killed and 151 wounded. The British tunnellers had gained an advantage over the German miners by the Autumn of 1916, which virtually ended the German underground threat. The British turned to digging 12 subways about down, to the front line, the longest tunnel being long of the dug. In one sector, four Tunnelling companies of 500 men each, worked around-the-clock in 18-hour shifts for two months to dig of subways for foot traffic, tramways with rails for hand-drawn trolleys and a light railway system. Most tunnels were lit by electricity, accommodated telephone cables and some had trams and water supplies. Caverns were dug into the sides for brigade and battalion HQs, first aid posts and store-rooms. The subways were found to be a most efficient way to relieve troops in the line, form up for the attack and then to evacuate wounded. Some of the tunnels were continued into Russian saps with exits in mine craters in no man's land and new mines were laid. Galleries were dug to be opened after the attack for communication or cable trenches, the work being done by the 172nd, 176th, 182nd and 185th Tunnelling companies (Lieutenant-Colonel G. C. Williams, Controller of Mines First Army).

Although the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> (RFC) entered the battle with inferior aircraft to the "<a href="Luftstreitkr%C3%A4fte">Luftstreitkräfte</a>", this did not deter their commander, <a href="Hugh%20Trenchard%20as%20commander%20of%20the%20Royal%20Flying%20Corps%20in%20France">General Trenchard</a>, from adopting an offensive posture. Dominance of the air over Arras was essential for reconnaissance and the British carried out many aerial patrols. RFC aircraft carried out artillery spotting, photography of trench systems and bombing. Aerial observation was hazardous work as, for best results, the aircraft had to fly at slow speeds and low altitude over the German defences. It became even more dangerous with the arrival of the Red Baron, <a href="Manfred%20von%20Richthofen">Manfred von Richthofen</a> in March 1917. The presence of <a href="Jagdstaffel%2011">"Jasta" 11</a> led to sharply increased losses of Allied pilots and April 1917, became known as <a href="Bloody%20April">Bloody April</a>. A German infantry officer later wrote,

The average flying life of a RFC pilot in Arras in April was 18 hours and from 4–8 April, the RFC lost 75 aircraft and 105 aircrew. The casualties created a pilot shortage and replacements were sent to the front straight from flying school; during the same period, 56 aircraft were crashed by inexperienced RFC pilots.

To keep enemy action to a minimum during the assault, a <a href="Rolling%20barrage">creeping barrage</a> was planned. This required gunners to create a curtain of <a href="Shell%20%28projectile%29%23High-explosive">high explosive</a> and <a href="shrapnel%20shell">shrapnel</a> shell explosions that crept across the battlefield in lines, about one hundred metres in advance of the assaulting troops. The Allies had previously used creeping barrages at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Neuve%20Chapelle">Battle of Neuve Chapelle</a> and the Battle of the Somme but had encountered two technical problems. The first was accurately synchronising the movement of the troops to the fall of the barrage: for Arras, this was overcome by rehearsal and strict scheduling. The second was the barrage falling erratically as the barrels of heavy guns wore swiftly but at differing rates during fire: for Arras, the rate of wear of each gun barrel was calculated and <a href="Calibration">calibrated</a> accordingly. While there was a risk of friendly fire, the creeping barrage forced the Germans to remain in their shelters, allowing Allied soldiers to advance without fear of machine gun fire. The new instantaneous <a href="No.%20106%20Fuze">No. 106 Fuze</a> had been adapted from a French design for high-explosive shells so that they detonated on the slightest impact, vaporising barbed wire. Poison gas shells were used for the final minutes of the barrage.

The principal danger to assaulting troops came from enemy artillery fire as they crossed <a href="no%20man%27s%20land">no man's land</a>, accounting for over half the casualties at the first day of the Somme. A further complication was the location of German artillery, hidden as it was behind the ridges. In response, specialist artillery units were created to attack German artillery. Their targets were provided by 1st Field Survey Company, Royal Engineers, who collated data obtained from <a href="flash%20spotting">flash spotting</a> and <a href="sound%20ranging">sound ranging</a>. (Flash spotting required Royal Flying Corps observers to record the location of telltale flashes made by guns whilst firing.) On Zero-Day, 9 April, over 80 percent of German heavy guns in the sector were neutralised (that is, "unable to bring effective fire to bear, the crews being disabled or driven off") by counter-battery fire. Gas shells were also used against the draught horses of the batteries and to disrupt ammunition supply columns.

Forty tanks of the 1st Brigade were to be used in the attack on the Third Army front, eight with XVIII Corps and sixteen each in VII Corps and VI Corps. When the blue line had been reached, four of the VII Corps tanks were to join VI Corps for its attack on the brown line. The black line (first objective) was not to be attacked by tanks, which were to begin the drive to the front line at zero hour and rendezvous with infantry at the black line two hours later. The tanks were reserved for the most difficult objectives beyond the black line in groups of up to ten vehicles. Four tanks were to attack Neuville Vitasse, four against Telegraph Hill, four against The Harp and another four against Tilloy lez Mofflaines and two were to drive down the slope from Roclincourt west of Bois de la Maison Blanche. Once the blue line had fallen, the tanks still running were to drive to rally points.

The preliminary bombardment of Vimy Ridge started on 20 March; and the bombardment of the rest of the sector on 4 April. Limited to a front of only , the bombardment used 2,689,000 shells, over a million more than had been used on the Somme. German casualties were not heavy but the men became exhausted by the endless task of keeping open dug-out entrances and demoralised by the absence of rations caused by the difficulties of preparing and moving hot food under bombardment. Some went without food altogether for two or three consecutive days. By the eve of battle, the front-line trenches had ceased to exist and their barbed wire defences were blown to pieces. The official history of the 2nd Bavarian Reserve Regiment describes the front line as "consisting no longer of trenches but of advanced nests of men scattered about". The 262nd Reserve Regiment history writes that its trench system was "lost in a crater field". To add to the misery, for the last ten hours of bombardment, <a href="Poison%20gas%20in%20World%20War%20I">gas shells</a> were added.

Zero-Hour had originally been planned for the morning of 8 April (Easter Sunday) but it was postponed 24 hours at the request of the French, despite reasonably good weather in the assault sector. Zero-Day was rescheduled for 9 April with Zero-Hour at 05:30. The assault was preceded by a <a href="hurricane%20bombardment">hurricane bombardment</a> lasting five minutes, following a relatively quiet night. When the time came, it was snowing heavily; Allied troops advancing across no man's land were hindered by large drifts. It was still dark and visibility on the battlefield was very poor. A westerly wind was at the Allied soldiers' backs blowing "a squall of sleet and snow into the faces of the Germans". The combination of the unusual bombardment and poor visibility meant many German troops were caught unawares and taken prisoner, still half-dressed, clambering out of the deep dug-outs of the first two lines of trenches. Others were captured without their boots, trying to escape but stuck in the knee-deep mud of the communication trenches.

The major British assault of the first day was directly east of Arras, with the <a href="12th%20%28Eastern%29%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">12th Division</a> attacking Observation Ridge, north of the Arras—Cambrai road. After reaching this objective, they were to push on towards Feuchy, as well as the second and third lines of German trenches. At the same time, elements of the <a href="3rd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">3rd Division</a> began an assault south of the road, with the taking of Devil's Wood, <a href="Tilloy-l%C3%A8s-Mofflaines">Tilloy-lès-Mofflaines</a> and the Bois des Boeufs as their initial objectives. The ultimate objective of these assaults was the "Monchyriegel", a trench running between Wancourt and Feuchy and an important component of the German defences. Most of these objectives, including Feuchy village, had been achieved by the evening of 10 April though the Germans were still in control of large sections of the trenches between Wancourt and Feuchy, particularly in the area of the heavily fortified village of Neuville-Vitasse. The following day, troops from the <a href="56th%20%281/1st%20London%29%20Division">56th Division</a> were able to force the Germans out of the village, although the "Monchyriegel" was not fully in British hands until a few days later. The British were able to consolidate these gains and push forward towards <a href="Monchy-le-Preux">Monchy-le-Preux</a>, although they suffered heavy casualties in fighting near the village.
One reason for the success of the offensive in this sector was the failure of Falkenhausen to employ a defence in depth. In theory, the enemy would be allowed to make initial gains, thus stretching their lines of communication. Reserves held close to the battlefield would be committed once the initial advance had bogged down, before enemy reinforcements could be brought up. The defenders would thus be able to counter-attack and regain any lost territory. In this sector, Falkenhausen kept his reserve troops too far from the front and they were too late for a useful counter-attack on either 10 or 11 April.

At roughly the same time, in perhaps the most carefully crafted portion of the entire offensive, the <a href="Canadian%20Corps">Canadian Corps</a> launched an assault on Vimy Ridge. Advancing behind a creeping barrage and making heavy use of machine guns – eighty to each brigade, including one <a href="Lewis%20Gun">Lewis gun</a> in each platoon – the corps was able to advance through about of German defences and captured the crest of the ridge at about 13:00. Military historians have attributed the success of this attack to careful planning by Canadian Corps commander <a href="Julian%20Byng">Julian Byng</a> and his subordinate <a href="Arthur%20Currie">General Arthur Currie</a>, constant training and the assignment of specific objectives to each platoon. By giving units specific goals, troops could continue the attack even if their officers were killed or communication broke down, thus bypassing two major problems of combat on the Western Front. The Canadian troops could see the Germans in retreat across the Douai Plain away from the ridge.There was nevertheless an inflexibility to the plan which prevented the leading troops from continuing the advance and on 10 April the Germans began to stop the gaps with reserves.

After the territorial gains of the first two days, a lull followed as the immense logistical support needed to keep armies in the field caught up with the new realities. Battalions of pioneers built temporary roads across the churned up battlefield; heavy artillery (and its ammunition) was manhandled into position in new gun pits; food for the men and feed for the draught horses was brought up and casualty clearing stations were established in readiness for the inevitable counter-attacks. Allied commanders also faced a dilemma: whether to keep their exhausted divisions on the attack and run the risk of having insufficient manpower or replace them with fresh divisions and lose momentum. In London, "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" printed,

The Berlin "<a href="Vossische%20Zeitung">Vossische Zeitung</a>," wrote: "We have to count on reverses like that near Arras. Such events are a kind of tactical reverse. If this tactical reverse is not followed by strategical effects i.e., breaking through on the part of the aggressor, then the whole battle is nothing but a weakening of the attacked party in men and materiel." The same day, the "<a href="Frankfurter%20Zeitung">Frankfurter Zeitung</a>" commented: "If the British succeed in breaking through it will render conditions worse for them as it will result in freedom of operations which is Germany's own special art of war". General Ludendorff was less sanguine. The news of the battle reached him during his 52nd birthday celebrations at his headquarters in Kreuznach. He wrote: "I had looked forward to the expected offensive with confidence and was now deeply depressed". He telephoned each of his commanders and "gained the impression that the principles laid down by "OHL" were sound but the whole art of leadership lies in applying them correctly". (A later court of inquiry would establish that Falkenhausen had indeed misunderstood the principles of defence in depth.) Ludendorff immediately ordered reinforcements. Then, on 11 April, he sacked Falkenhausen's chief of staff and replaced him with Loßberg. Loßberg went armed with "vollmacht" (a power of command enabling him to issue orders in the army ccommander's name), replacing Falkenhausen. Within hours of arriving, Loßberg began to restructure the German defences. The British aimed to consolidate the gains made in the first days of the offensive, to keep the initiative and to break through in concert with the French at Aisne. From 16 April, it was apparent that the French part of the Nivelle Offensive on the Aisne had not achieved a breakthrough. Haig continued to attack at Arras, to continue to divert troops from the French on the Aisne.

At 04:45 on 23 April, following two days of poor visibility and freezing weather, British troops of the Third Army (VI and VII corps), attacked to the east along an approximate front from Croisilles to Gavrelle on both sides of the Scarpe. The 51st Division attacked on the northern side in heavy fighting on the western outskirts of Roeux Wood and the chemical works. On their left, the 37th Division, attacked the buildings west of Roeux Station and gained the line of their objectives on the western slopes of Greenland Hill, north of the railway. On the left of the main British attack the 63rd Division, made rapid progress against Gavrelle and secured the village. To the south of the Scarpe and east of Monchy-le-Preux the 29th Division gained the western slopes of the rising ground known as Infantry Hill. The Cojeul river marked a divisional boundary within the VI Corps. Guémappe on the north side of the river was the objective of the 15th Division, attacking east from Wancourt towards Vis-en-Artois. The objective was commanded by the higher ground on the south bank and it was not until the 50th Division captured the rise on the south side of the Cojeul that the village was taken. Several determined German counter-attacks were made and by the morning of 24 April, the British held Guémappe, Gavrelle and the high ground overlooking Fontaine-lez-Croisilles and Cherisy; the fighting around Roeux was indecisive.

The principal objective of the attack was the need to sustain a supporting action tying down German reserves to assist the French offensive against the plateau north of the Aisne traversed by the Chemin des Dames. Haig reported,

At 04:25 on 28 April, British and Canadian troops launched the main attack on a front of about north of Monchy-le-Preux. The battle continued for most of 28 and 29 April, with the Germans delivering determined counter-attacks. The British positions at Gavrelle were attacked seven times with strong forces and on each occasion the German thrust was repulsed with great loss by the 63rd Division. The village of Arleux-en-Gohelle was captured by the 1st Canadian Division after hand-to-hand fighting and the 2nd Division (Major-General C. E. Pereira), made further progress in the neighbourhood of Oppy, Greenland Hill (37th Division) and between Monchy-le-Preux and the Scarpe (12th Division).

After securing the area around Arleux at the end of April, the British determined to launch another attack east from Monchy to try to break through the "Boiry Riegel" and reach the "Wotanstellung", a major German defensive fortification. This was scheduled to coincide with the Australian attack at Bullecourt to present the Germans with a two–pronged assault. British commanders hoped that success in this venture would force the Germans to retreat further to the east. With this objective in mind, the British launched another attack near the Scarpe on 3 May. However, neither prong was able to make any significant advances and the attack was called off the following day after incurring heavy casualties. Although this battle was a failure, the British learned important lessons about the need for close liaison between tanks, infantry and artillery, which they would use in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cambrai%20%281917%29">Battle of Cambrai, 1917</a>.

South of Arras, the plan called for two divisions, the <a href="62nd%20%282nd%20West%20Riding%29%20Division">British 62nd Division</a> and the <a href="4th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">Australian 4th Division</a> to attack either side of the village of <a href="Bullecourt">Bullecourt</a> and push the Germans out of their fortified positions and into the reserve trenches. The attack was initially scheduled for the morning of 10 April but the tanks intended for the assault were delayed by bad weather and the attack was postponed for 24 hours. The order to delay did not reach all units in time and two battalions of the <a href="West%20Yorkshire%20Regiment%20%28The%20Prince%20of%20Wales%27s%20Own%29">West Yorkshire Regiment</a> attacked and were driven back with significant losses. Despite protests from the Australian commanders, the attack was resumed on the morning of 11 April; mechanical failures meant that only 11 tanks were able to advance in support and the limited artillery barrage left much of the <a href="barbed%20wire">barbed wire</a> in front of the German trenches uncut. Additionally, the abortive attack of the previous day alerted German troops in the area to the impending assault and they were better prepared than they had been in the Canadian sector. Misleading reports about the extent of the gains made by the Australians deprived them of necessary artillery support and although elements of the 4th Division briefly occupied sections of German trenches, they were ultimately forced to retreat with heavy losses. In this sector, the German commanders correctly employed the <a href="elastic%20defence">elastic defence</a> and were therefore able to counter-attack effectively. The Germans acquired two of the tanks which had been used and after seeing them perforated by armour-piercing bullets, believed the rifle A.P. bullet was an effective anti-tank weapon, which threw them off-guard.

Observing that the <a href="1st%20Division%20%28Australia%29">1st Australian Division</a> was holding a frontage of , the local German corps commander (General <a href="Otto%20von%20Moser">Otto von Moser</a>, commanding the German <a href="XIV%20Reserve%20Corps%20%28German%20Empire%29">XIV Reserve Corps</a>) planned a spoiling attack to drive back the advanced posts, destroy supplies and guns and then retire to the Hindenburg defences. Passing his plans to higher command they assigned an extra division to his corps to further strengthen the attack. Attacking with 23 battalions (from four divisions), the German forces managed to penetrate the Australian front line at the junction on the 1st Australian Division and <a href="2nd%20Division%20%28Australia%29">2nd Australian Division</a> and occupy the village of <a href="Lagnicourt-Marcel">Lagnicourt</a> (damaging some Australian artillery pieces). Counter-attacks from the Australian <a href="9th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">9th</a> and <a href="20th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">20th</a> Australian battalions, restored the front line and the action ended with the Australians suffering 1,010 casualties, against 2,313 German casualties.

After the initial assault around Bullecourt failed to penetrate the German lines, British commanders made preparations for a second attempt. British artillery began an intense bombardment of the village, which by 20 April had been virtually destroyed. Although the infantry assault was planned for 20 April, it was pushed back a number of times and finally set for the early morning of 3 May. At 03:45, elements of the 2nd Australian Division attacked east of Bullecourt village, intending to pierce the Hindenburg Line and capture <a href="Hendecourt-l%C3%A8s-Cagnicourt">Hendecourt-lès-Cagnicourt</a>, while British troops from the 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division attacked Bullecourt, which was finally taken by the British 7th Division and despite determined effort by the Germans was held by the British 62nd Division. German resistance was fierce and when the offensive was called off on 17 May, few of the initial objectives had been met. The Australians were in possession of much of the German trench system between Bullecourt and <a href="Riencourt-l%C3%A8s-Cagnicourt">Riencourt-lès-Cagnicourt</a> but had been unable to capture Hendecourt. To the west, British troops managed to push the Germans out of Bullecourt but incurred considerable losses, failing also to advance north-east to Hendecourt.

By the standards of the Western Front, the gains of the first two days were nothing short of spectacular. A great deal of ground was gained for relatively few casualties and a number of tactically significant points were captured, notably Vimy Ridge. The offensive drew German troops away from the French offensive in the Aisne sector. In many respects, the battle might be deemed a victory for the British and their allies but these gains were offset by high casualties after the first two days and the failure of the French offensive at the Aisne. By the end of the offensive, the British had suffered more than 150,000 casualties and gained little ground since the first day. Despite significant early gains, they were unable to break through and the situation reverted to stalemate. Although historians generally consider the battle a British victory, in the wider context of the front, it had very little impact on the strategic or tactical situation. Ludendorff later commented "no doubt exceedingly important strategic objects lay behind the British attack but I have never been able to discover what they were". Ludendorff was also "very depressed; had our principles of defensive tactics proved false and if so, what was to be done?"

On the Allied side, twenty-five <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>es were awarded. On the German side, on 24 April 1917, <a href="William%20II%2C%20German%20Emperor">Kaiser Wilhelm</a> awarded Loßberg the Oakleaves (similar to a <a href="Medal%20bar">bar</a> for a repeat award) for the <a href="Pour%20le%20M%C3%A9rite">Pour le Mérite</a> he had received at the Battle of the Somme the previous September.

The most quoted Allied casualty figures are those in the returns made by Lt-Gen Sir <a href="George%20H.%20Fowke">George Fowke</a>, Haig's adjutant-general. His figures collate the daily casualty tallies kept by each unit under Haig's command. Third Army casualties were 87,226; First Army 46,826 (including 11,004 Canadians at Vimy Ridge); and Fifth Army 24,608; totalling 158,660.
German losses are more difficult to determine. "Gruppe Vimy" and "Gruppe Souchez" suffered 79,418 casualties but the figures for "Gruppe Arras" are incomplete. The writers of the German Official History "Der Weltkrieg", recorded losses to the end of April and another by the end of May, a total of and casualties. German records excluded those "lightly wounded". Captain Cyril Falls (the writer of the Official History volume on the battle) estimated that 30 percent needed to be added to German returns for comparison with the British. Falls made "a general estimate" that German casualties were "probably fairly equal". Nicholls puts them at 120,000 and Keegan at 130,000.

Although Haig paid tribute to Allenby for the plan's "great initial success", Allenby's subordinates "objected to the way he handled the ... attritional stage". Allenby was sent to command the <a href="Egyptian%20Expeditionary%20Force">Egyptian Expeditionary Force</a> in Palestine. He regarded the transfer as a "badge of failure", but he "more than redeemed his reputation by defeating" the Ottomans in battles that were fought in the <a href="Sinai%20and%20Palestine%20Campaign">Sinai and Palestine Campaign</a> in 1917–18. Haig stayed in his post until the end of the war. When the failures of the 6th Army command became apparent, Ludendorff removed Falkenhausen (who never held a field command again, spending the rest of war as <a href="General%20Governorate%20of%20Belgium">Governor-General of Belgium</a>) and several staff officers. In early 1918, "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" carried an article, "Falkenhausen's Reign of Terror", describing 170 military executions of Belgian civilians since he had been appointed governor. Ludendorff and Loßberg discovered that although the Allies were capable of breaking through the first position, they could probably not capitalise on their success if they were confronted by a mobile, clever defence. Ludendorff immediately ordered more training in <a href="manoeuvre%20warfare">manoeuvre warfare</a> for the "Eingreif" divisions. Loßberg was soon promoted to general and directed the defensive battle of the 4th Army against the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Flanders">Flanders Offensive</a> of the summer and late autumn; he had become "legendary as the fireman of the Western Front; always sent by OHL to the area of crisis".

<a href="Siegfried%20Sassoon">Siegfried Sassoon</a> makes reference to the battle in the poem .

Operation Brevity

Operation Brevity was a limited offensive conducted in mid-May 1941, during the <a href="Western%20Desert%20Campaign">Western Desert Campaign</a> of the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>. Conceived by the commander-in-chief of the British <a href="Middle%20East%20Command">Middle East Command</a>, General <a href="Archibald%20Wavell">Archibald Wavell</a>, Brevity was intended to be a rapid blow against weak <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> front-line forces in the <a href="Sallum">Sollum</a>–<a href="Fort%20Capuzzo">Capuzzo</a>–<a href="Bardia%2C%20Libya">Bardia</a> area of the border between Egypt and Libya. Although the operation got off to a promising start, throwing the Axis high command into confusion, most of its early gains were lost to local counter-attacks, and with German reinforcements being rushed to the front the operation was called off after one day.

Egypt had been <a href="Italian%20invasion%20of%20Egypt">invaded</a> by Libyan-based <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy%20%281861%E2%80%931946%29">Italian</a> forces in September 1940, but by February of the following year a <a href="Operation%20Compass">British counter-offensive</a> had advanced well into Libya, destroying the <a href="Tenth%20Army%20%28Italy%29">Italian Tenth Army</a> in the process. British attention then shifted to Greece, which was under the threat of Axis invasion. While Allied divisions were being diverted from North Africa, the Italians reinforced their positions and were supported by the arrival of the German "<a href="Afrika%20Korps">Afrika Korps</a>" under "<a href="Generalleutnant">Generalleutnant</a>" <a href="Erwin%20Rommel">Erwin Rommel</a>. Rapidly taking the offensive against his distracted and over-stretched opponent, by April 1941 Rommel had driven the British and Commonwealth forces in <a href="Cyrenaica">Cyrenaica</a> back across the Egyptian border. Although the battlefront now lay in the border area, the port city of <a href="Tobruk">Tobruk</a>— inside Libya—had resisted the Axis advance, and its substantial Australian and British garrison constituted a significant threat to Rommel's lengthy supply chain. He therefore committed his main strength to besieging the city, leaving the front line only thinly held.

Wavell defined Operation Brevity's main objectives as the acquisition of territory from which to launch a further planned offensive toward Tobruk, and the depletion of German and Italian forces in the region. With limited battle-ready units to draw on in the wake of Rommel's recent successes, on 15 May Brigadier <a href="William%20Gott">William Gott</a> attacked in three columns with a mixed infantry and armoured force. The strategically important <a href="Halfaya%20Pass">Halfaya Pass</a> was taken against stiff Italian opposition, and deeper inside Libya Fort Capuzzo was captured, but German counter-attacks under <a href="Colonel">Colonel</a> <a href="Maximilian%20von%20Herff">Maximilian von Herff</a> regained the fort during the afternoon causing heavy casualties amongst its defenders. Gott—concerned that his forces were in danger of being caught by German armour in open ground—conducted a staged withdrawal to the Halfaya Pass on 16 May, and Brevity was closed down. The importance of the Halfaya Pass as a safe supply route was highlighted to Rommel, and 11 days later it was recaptured during <a href="Operation%20Skorpion">Operation Skorpion</a>, a German counter-attack.

In early September 1940, the Italian <a href="Tenth%20Army%20%28Italy%29">10th Army</a> based in <a href="Italian%20Libya">Libya</a> conducted the <a href="Italian%20invasion%20of%20Egypt">Italian invasion of Egypt</a> and three months later, the British and Commonwealth troops of the <a href="Western%20Desert%20Force">Western Desert Force</a> began a counter-offensive, codenamed <a href="Operation%20Compass">Operation Compass</a>. In two months, the British advanced , occupying the Italian province of <a href="Cyrenaica">Cyrenaica</a> and destroying the 10th Army. The advance was halted in February 1941 because of supply shortages and to give priority to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Greece">Battle of Greece</a>. Renamed <a href="XIII%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">XIII Corps</a> and reorganised under HQ Cyrenaica Command (CYRCOM), the troops of the former Western Desert Force adopted a defensive posture. Over the next few months, HQ Cyrenaica lost its commander, <a href="Lieutenant-general%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Lieutenant-General</a> Sir <a href="Henry%20Maitland%20Wilson">Henry Maitland Wilson</a>, followed by the <a href="2nd%20New%20Zealand%20Division">2nd New Zealand Division</a> and the <a href="6th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">6th Australian Division</a> when they were sent to <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Greece%20%28Gl%C3%BCcksburg%29">Greece</a> in <a href="Operation%20Lustre">Operation Lustre</a>. The <a href="7th%20Armoured%20Division">7th Armoured Division</a>, with virtually no serviceable tanks left, was also withdrawn and sent to the <a href="Nile%20Delta">Nile Delta</a> for rest and refitting. Wilson was replaced by Lieutenant-General <a href="Philip%20Neame">Philip Neame</a>; parts of the <a href="2nd%20Armoured%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">2nd Armoured Division</a> and <a href="9th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">9th Australian Division</a> were deployed to Cyrenaica but both formations were inexperienced, ill-equipped and in the case of the 2nd Armoured Division, well under strength, after detachments to Greece.
The Italians responded by despatching the <a href="Italian%20132nd%20Armored%20Division%20Ariete">132nd Armoured Division "Ariete"</a> and <a href="Italian%20102%20Motorised%20Division%20Trento">102nd Motorised Division"Trento"</a> to North Africa. From February 1941 until early May, <a href="Operation%20Sonnenblume">Operation Sonnenblume</a> saw the arrival of the German "<a href="Afrika%20Korps">Afrika Korps</a>" in <a href="Tripoli">Tripoli</a> to reinforce their Italian allies. Commanded by "<a href="Generalleutnant">Generalleutnant</a>" <a href="Erwin%20Rommel">Erwin Rommel</a> and consisting of the <a href="21st%20Panzer%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">5th Light</a> and <a href="33rd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">15th Panzer Division</a>, the "Afrika Korps" was to block Allied attempts to drive the Italians out of the region. Rommel seized on the weakness of his opponents and without waiting for his forces fully to assemble, rapidly went on the offensive. During March and April, the remaining units of the 2nd Armoured Division were destroyed as the <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis forces</a> advanced, which also forced the British and Commonwealth forces into retreat. Neame and the <a href="General%20Officer%20Commanding">General Officer Commanding</a> <a href="Egypt%20Command">British Troops Egypt</a>—Lieutenant-General <a href="Richard%20O%27Connor">Richard O'Connor</a>—were captured and the British command structure had to be reorganised. HQ Cyrenaica was dissolved on 14 April and its command functions taken over by a new HQ Western Desert Force (Lieutenant-General <a href="Noel%20Beresford-Peirse">Noel Beresford-Peirse</a>). The 9th Australian Infantry Division fell back to the fortress port of <a href="Tobruk">Tobruk</a> and the remaining British forces withdrew a further east to <a href="Sallum">Sollum</a> on the Libyan–<a href="Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Egyptian</a> border. With the main Axis force conducting the <a href="Siege%20of%20Tobruk">Siege of Tobruk</a> a small battlegroup ("<a href="Kampfgruppe">Kampfgruppe</a>") commanded by Colonel <a href="Maximilian%20von%20Herff">Maximilian von Herff</a> continued to press eastward. Capturing <a href="Fort%20Capuzzo">Fort Capuzzo</a> and <a href="Bardia">Bardia</a> in passing, it then advanced into Egypt; by the end of April had taken Sollum and the tactically important <a href="Halfaya%20Pass">Halfaya Pass</a>. Rommel garrisoned these positions, reinforced the "Kampfgruppe" and ordered it onto the defensive.

The Tobruk garrison received supplies from the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> and Rommel was unable to take the port. This failure was significant; his front line positions at Sollum were at the end of an extended supply chain that stretched back to Tripoli and was threatened by the Tobruk garrison. The substantial commitment required to <a href="Investment%20%28military%29">invest</a> Tobruk prevented him from building up his forces at Sollum, making further advances into Egypt impractical. By maintaining possession of Tobruk, the Allies had regained the initiative.

<a href="General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">General</a> <a href="Archibald%20Wavell">Archibald Wavell</a>—the commander-in-chief of the British <a href="Middle%20East%20Command">Middle East Command</a>—conceived Operation Brevity as a rapid blow in the Sollum area. Wavell intended to create advantageous conditions from which to launch <a href="Operation%20Battleaxe">Operation Battleaxe</a>, the main offensive that he was planning for June. Operation Brevity's primary objectives were to recapture the Halfaya Pass, to drive the enemy from the Sollum and Capuzzo areas, and to deplete Rommel's forces. A secondary objective was to advance toward Tobruk, although only as far as supplies would allow, and without risking the force committed to the operation.

Operation Brevity would be carried out by the <a href="22nd%20Guards%20Brigade">22nd Guards Brigade</a> and elements of the 7th Armoured Division. Its armoured component consisted of 29 <a href="cruiser%20tank">cruiser tank</a>s of the <a href="2nd%20Royal%20Tank%20Regiment">2nd Royal Tank Regiment</a> (2RTR) and 24 <a href="infantry%20tank">infantry tank</a>s of the <a href="4th%20Royal%20Tank%20Regiment">4th Royal Tank Regiment</a> (4RTR). The <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) allocated all available fighters and a small force of bombers to the operation.

<a href="Brigadier%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Brigadier</a> <a href="William%20Gott">William Gott</a>—in command of all Allied front-line forces since the retreat—was to lead the operation in the field, and his plan was to advance in three parallel <a href="Flying%20column">columns</a>. On the desert flank to the south, the 7th Armoured <a href="Brigade%20group">Brigade group</a> was to move from Bir el Khireigat to Sidi Azeiz destroying any opposition encountered en route. This group included three small mobile forces ("<a href="Jock%20column">Jock column</a>s") of the <a href="British%207th%20Support%20Group">7th Support Group</a>, the cruiser tanks of 2RTR, and the <a href="Armored%20car%20%28military%29">armoured cars</a> of the <a href="11th%20Hussars">11th Hussars</a>, whose task was to patrol the open desert on the left flank and monitor the Sidi Azeiz–Bardia road. In the centre, the 22nd Guards Brigade group was to clear the top of the Halfaya Pass, secure Bir Wair, <a href="Musaid">Musaid</a>, and Fort Capuzzo, and conduct a company-sized probe toward Bardia. The group included two infantry formations (1st Battalion <a href="Durham%20Light%20Infantry">Durham Light Infantry</a> and 2nd Battalion <a href="Scots%20Guards">Scots Guards</a>), and the infantry tanks of 4RTR. In the north, the "coast group" was to advance along the coast road, capturing the lower Halfaya Pass, Sollum barracks, and the town of Sollum. The group included elements of the 2nd Battalion <a href="The%20Rifle%20Brigade">The Rifle Brigade</a>, and the 8th Field Regiment <a href="Royal%20Artillery">Royal Artillery</a>.

The main Axis opposition was "Kampfgruppe" von Herff, positioned on the desert plateau. It included 30–50 tanks of the 2nd Battalion Panzer Regiment 5, an Italian motorised infantry battalion of the "Trento" Division, and supporting arms. The front line area around Halfaya Pass was defended by two companies of "<a href="Bersaglieri">Bersaglieri</a>"—well trained Italian motorised infantry—with artillery support.

On 9 May, the Germans intercepted a British weather report over the radio. The "Afrika Korps" war diary noted that "In the past, such reports had always been issued prior to the important enemy offensives to <a href="Battle%20of%20Sidi%20Barrani">capture Sidi Barrani</a>, Bardi, Tobruk, and the Gebel." Rommel's response was to strengthen the eastern side of his cordon around Tobruk as a precaution against <a href="sortie">sortie</a>s from the garrison, and to order "Kampfgruppe" von Herff to adopt a more aggressive posture. On 13 May, Axis aircraft bombed British tank concentrations, and Herff expected an imminent British attack. However, the following day aircraft were unable to locate the British, and it was reported that the "enemy intentions to attack were not known".

On 13 May, Wavell's infantry battalions began to concentrate at their start lines, followed by the tank regiments during the early hours of 15 May. At 06:00, the three columns began their advance, supported overhead by a standing patrol of <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a> fighters.

Reaching the top of the Halfaya Pass, the 22nd Guards Brigade group ran into heavy opposition from an Italian "Bersaglieri" infantry <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a>, supported by anti-tank guns, under the command of Colonel <a href="Ugo%20Montemurro">Ugo Montemurro</a>. This unit fought tenaciously, doing much to repair the poor impression Rommel had of his Italian allies. Opening fire upon the attacking British tanks, the "Bersaglieri" found their <a href="Cannone%20da%2047/32%20M35">47mm anti-tank guns</a> to be unable to penetrate the armour of the <a href="Matilda%20II">Matilda</a> infantry tanks. At , the gunners shifted targets. Now aiming at the tracks and undercarriages, when the tanks raised up crossing low stone walls and rocks, seven tanks were disabled. For his conduct during this action, Rommel recommended that Montemurro be awarded the <a href="Iron%20Cross%20First%20Class">Iron Cross First Class</a>. At the cost of these seven tanks, the position was taken by C Squadron 4RTR and G Company 2nd Scots Guards, and the brigade group pushed on towards the Bir Wair-Musaid road. At around 08:00, it received the surrender of a large German-Italian camp, and by 10:15 Bir Wair and Musaid had been taken in the face of limited opposition.

A Squadron 4RTR and the 1st Durham Light Infantry (1DLI) continued the advance toward Fort Capuzzo. Concealed in <a href="hull%20down">hull down</a> positions behind a ridge near the fort were 20–30 German tanks, supported by anti tank guns. These engaged A Squadron, disabling five tanks, but were forced to withdraw as the squadron pressed its attack. On the final approach to Fort Capuzzo, contact was lost between 4RTR's tanks and 1DLI's leading C Company, and the attack on the fort began without armoured support. The fort was vigorously defended, and it was not until just before midday that C Company, reunited with A Squadron 4RTR and reinforced by A and B Companies 1DLI, eventually took the position. D Company 1DLI—which had been in reserve during the attack—then made a wide left hook to capture a small landing ground to the north of the fort.

In the afternoon, one company of the 2nd Scots Guards probed toward Bardia, the infantry coming under heavy machine gun fire from three positions as they neared Sollum barracks. A group of <a href="Universal%20Carrier">Universal Carrier</a>s—commanded by <a href="Sergeant">Sergeant</a> F. Riley—charged the gun positions and quickly neutralised them, but one carrier was disabled when the group was subsequently engaged by anti-tank guns. Riley executed a second charge, silencing these too and taking their crews prisoner. His carrier was hit three times; for his actions Riley was awarded the <a href="Military%20Medal">Military Medal</a>, the battalion's first decoration of the war.

On the desert flank, 2RTR advanced with the 7th Armoured Brigade group. During the morning, reports were received of up to 30 German armoured vehicles operating nearby, and A Squadron 2RTR moved to investigate. Most of the German force had pulled back, but three tanks were located and brought under fire. One <a href="Panzer%20IV">Panzer IV</a> was disabled and the other two driven off, for the loss of one British tank due to mechanical failure. A second force of 15 German tanks was engaged by two tanks of No 2 Troop, destroying a <a href="Panzer%20III">Panzer III</a> and forcing the remainder to withdraw. By midday, the brigade group had reached a position west of Fort Capuzzo, and in the afternoon the nine remaining cruisers of A Squadron 2RTR began a reconnaissance patrol towards Sidi Azeiz.

The advance along the coastal road—which lacked tank support—was held up all morning by determined Italian resistance at the bottom of Halfaya Pass. This objective was finally achieved toward evening when S Company 2nd Rifle Brigade—supported by Australian anti-tank gunners fighting as infantry—overran the Italian positions taking around 130 prisoners.

Although the German and Italian commands in North Africa knew that a British offensive was imminent, Operation Brevity nevertheless caught them unprepared, and Rommel recorded in his diary that the initial attacks had caused him considerable losses. By midday on 15 May, Axis command was showing signs of confusion. It was erroneously believed that the offensive involved more than 100 tanks, and repeated requests were made to both the "<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>" and the "<a href="Regia%20Aeronautica">Regia Aeronautica</a>" for a concerted effort to defeat it. Forces around Tobruk were redeployed east of the besieged city, to block any attempt at relief and to prevent the garrison from breaking out to meet the British advance. <a href="Lieutenant%20colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</a> <a href="Hans%20Cramer">Hans Cramer</a> was sent to reinforce "Kampfgruppe" von Herff with a tank battalion from Panzer Regiment 8 and a battery of <a href="88%20mm%20gun">anti-aircraft gun</a>s, and additional reinforcements under General <a href="Hans-Karl%20Freiherr%20von%20Esebeck">Hans-Karl Freiherr von Esebeck</a> were despatched the following day.

The Germans concentrated their riposte against the central column. Herff—who had been prepared to fall back—instead launched a local counter-attack toward Fort Capuzzo during the afternoon of 15 May with the 2nd Battalion Panzer Regiment 5. At around 13:30, D Company 1DLI at the landing ground was overrun, and with no anti-tank support more capable than the <a href="Rifle%2C%20Anti-Tank%2C%20.55%20in%2C%20Boys">Boys anti-tank rifle</a>, the remaining troops of 1DLI were forced to fall back toward Musaid. A fortuitous dust cloud aided their withdrawal, but by 14:45 Panzer Regiment 5 was reporting that it had recaptured Capuzzo, inflicting heavy casualties on the British and taking 70 prisoners.

On the desert flank, A Squadron 2RTR's patrol toward Sidi Azeiz was being monitored by Panzer Regiment 5, but the Germans misidentified the light cruiser tanks as heavily armoured Matilda infantry tanks, and reported that an attack was not possible. Herff—believing the British had two divisions operating in the area—had grown uneasy. A Squadron's patrol was interpreted as an attempt to concentrate south of Sidi Azeiz, in preparation for a thrust north the next day; such a move threatened to sweep aside Herff's force and completely unhinge the German front in the Sollum–Bardia area. In response, Herff broke contact with the British; his plan was to join up with Cramer's Panzer Regiment 8 to mount a concentrated counter-attack the following morning.

Realising that the 22nd Guards Brigade group would be vulnerable to German armoured counterattacks in the open ground around Bir Wair and Mussaid, Brigadier Gott withdrew it during the early hours of the morning of 16 May. By 10:00, the infantry had taken up new positions back at Halfaya Pass, although the 7th Armoured Brigade group was ordered to remain west of Fort Capuzzo for the time being.

Cramer's reinforcements arrived in the Sidi Azeiz area at 03:00 and reached Fort Capuzzo at 06:30. At around 08:00, he made contact with "Kampfgruppe" von Herff, but by mid-morning both groups had run out of fuel. The German advance resumed at 16:00 before being stopped by around 17 tanks of 2RTR. The British reported one German tank set alight and another disabled and that an advance of up to fifty tanks had been halted, while the Germans believed that they had repulsed a strong British tank attack. As nightfall approached, Herff broke off the action and went on to the defensive. He intended to repair his damaged machines, reorganise, and resume offensive operations on 18 May. 2RTR pulled back to Bir el Khireigat, initially followed by two German tanks, one of which withdrew after the other was destroyed. The regiment arrived at Bir el Khireigat, from where it had set out two days previously, at around 02:30 on 17 May.

Operation Brevity failed to achieve most of its objectives, succeeding only in retaking the Halfaya Pass. The British lost five tanks destroyed and a further 13 were damaged but the tank regiments suffered no losses in personnel. Total casualties amounted to at least 206 men. The 1st Durham Light Infantry suffered the most during the operation losing 196 men killed, wounded or captured. The 2nd Scots Guards lost one man killed and four wounded, the 3rd Coldstream Guards lost one man killed and the 11th Hussars suffered four men wounded. Losses among the 2nd Rifle Brigade are unknown. German casualties numbered three tanks (a <a href="Panzer%20II">Panzer II</a> and two Panzer IIIs, although several more suffered minor damage) and 258 men killed, wounded or captured. Jack Greene and Alessandro Massignani place total Italian losses at 395. Allied accounts record the capture of 347 of these men.

On 5 August, Herff praised the "Bersaglieri", who had defended Halfaya Pass "...with lionlike courage until the last man against stronger enemy forces. The greatest part of them died faithful to the flag." Lieutenant <a href="Giacinto%20Cova">Giacinto Cova</a>, a platoon commander in the 8th "Bersaglieri" Regiment, received a posthumous <a href="Gold%20Medal%20of%20Military%20Valour">Gold Medal of Military Valour</a>, Italy's highest award for bravery. The medal citation reported that Cova had organised a counter-attack and was killed attempting to throw a hand-held bomb at a British tank. The British received plaudits from <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, who sent a telegram to Wavell betraying his ignorance of events by stating: "Without using the Tiger cubs you have taken the offensive, advanced , captured Halfaya and Sollum, taken 500 German prisoners and inflicted heavy losses in men and tanks. For this twenty I tanks and 1,000 or 1,500 casualties do not seem too heavy a cost." Churchill ended the message by asking Wavell "What are your dates for bringing Tiger cubs into action?", in reference to the reinforcements that had arrived at <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> on 12 May as part of a convoy code-named Operation Tiger. The 11th Hussar's regimental history notes that "it was clear that no further offensive action would be possible before 7[th] Arm[oured Division] was fully prepared". The Tiger convoy brought 238 tanks and made it possible to refit the 7th Armoured Division, which had been out of action since February as a result of the losses it sustained during Operation Compass. Preparations could now be made for Operation Battleaxe and the relief of Tobruk. In the system of British and Commonwealth <a href="battle%20honours">battle honours</a>, units that served in the Halfaya Pass area between 15 and 27 May were awarded the honour "Halfaya 1941" in 1957.

Historian Thomas Jentz suggests that Brevity could have ended in victory for the British. While their tank forces were fighting ineffectively, the "gutsy" actions by 2RTR and their patrol toward Sidi Azeiz had convinced the Germans that the battle was lost by the evening of 15 May. Because of their failure to engage 2RTR late that day, several German commanders from Panzer Regiment 5, including its commanding officer, were removed from their posts after the battle. Jentz notes that a feint by the <a href="1st%20Royal%20Tank%20Regiment">1st</a> and <a href="7th%20Royal%20Tank%20Regiment">7th RTR</a> out of Tobruk might have caused a realignment of the Axis forces, weakening their overall position and perhaps even forcing them to give up the Sollum area.

Operation Brevity highlighted to Rommel the importance of the Halfaya Pass; whichever side held it would have a "comparatively safe route for his supplies" during offensives in the area. On 27 May, he launched <a href="Operation%20Skorpion">Operation Skorpion</a>, during which Herff recaptured the pass and reversed the last British territorial gain from Brevity.

Roy of the Rovers

Roy of the Rovers is a British <a href="comic%20strip">comic strip</a> about the life and times of a fictional <a href="association%20football">footballer</a> named Roy Race, who played for Melchester Rovers. The strip first appeared in the "<a href="Tiger%20%28Fleetway%29">Tiger</a>" in 1954, before giving its name to a weekly (and later monthly) <a href="comic%20magazine">comic magazine</a>, published by <a href="IPC%20Media">IPC</a> and <a href="Fleetway">Fleetway</a> from 1976 until 1995, in which it was the main feature.

The weekly strip ran until 1993, following Roy's playing career until its conclusion after he lost his left foot in a helicopter crash. When the monthly comic was launched later that year the focus switched to Roy's son Rocky, who also played for Melchester. This publication was short-lived, and folded after only 19 issues. The adventures of the Race family were subsequently featured in the monthly "<a href="Match%20of%20the%20Day">Match of the Day</a>" football magazine, in which father and son were reunited as manager and player respectively. These strips began in 1997 and continued until the magazine's closure in May 2001.

Football-themed stories were a staple of British comics for boys from the 1950s onwards, and Roy of the Rovers was the most popular. To keep the strip exciting, Melchester was almost every year either competing for major honours or struggling against relegation to a lower division; a normal, uneventful season of mid-table mediocrity was unknown at Melchester Rovers. The strip followed the structure of the actual English football season, thus there were several months each year in summer when there was no league football. By far the most common summer storyline saw Melchester touring a fictional country in an exotic part of the world, often South America, where they would invariably be kidnapped and held to ransom. The average reader probably stayed with the comic regularly for only three or four years, therefore storylines were sometimes recycled; during the first ten years of his playing career, Roy was kidnapped at least four times. Roy also made numerous appearances for England, depicted playing alongside actual players such as <a href="Malcolm%20Macdonald">Malcolm Macdonald</a> and <a href="Trevor%20Francis">Trevor Francis</a>.

The stock media phrase "real 'Roy of the Rovers' stuff" is often used by football writers, commentators and fans when describing displays of great skill, or surprising results that go against the odds, in reference to the dramatic storylines that were the strip's trademark.

Roy of the Rovers first appeared on 11 September 1954, as a weekly feature in the comic magazine "<a href="Tiger%20%28Fleetway%29">Tiger</a>", debuting on the front page of the first issue. After 22 years of continued popularity, the strip was judged successful enough to sustain its own weekly comic, the eponymous "<a href="Roy%20of%20the%20Rovers%20%28comic%29">Roy of the Rovers</a>", launched on 25 September 1976. The comic ran for 851 issues, until 20 March 1993, and included other football strips and features. At the peak of the comic's success about 450,000 copies were sold each week. There were also hardback <a href="annual%20publication">annuals</a> and holiday specials featuring a mix of reprinted and original content, and for a brief period, starting in 1986, Roy of the Rovers was <a href="Kim%20Raymond">serialised</a> in the now defunct "<a href="Today%20%28UK%20newspaper%29">Today</a>" newspaper. These were all-new strips, focusing largely on the relationship between Roy and his wife Penny, rather than the action on the pitch. Between 1988 and 1993, a "Best of Roy of the Rovers" monthly comic was published, reprinting older stories.

Following the closure of the weekly title in 1993, the strip appeared in a relaunched monthly publication in September that year, with grittier storylines intended to attract teen and young adult fans who had read the weekly comic in their youth. Between January 1994 and January 1995, the monthly strips were mirrored by a weekly edition in "<a href="Shoot%20%28football%20magazine%29">Shoot</a>" magazine, which had in the late 1980s published a parody called Ray of the Rangers.

The comic strip was resurrected in July 1997, printed as short (usually two-page) features in the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s monthly "<a href="Match%20of%20the%20Day">Match of the Day</a>" magazine. These strips ran until the magazine's demise in May 2001. By then the strip's wholesome tone, often espousing the virtues of fair play and strong moral character, was beginning to seem old-fashioned. The editor of "Roy of the Rovers" comic, Barrie Tomlinson, has commented that "everyone seemed to be growing up a bit more quickly, and they wanted stories that were more realistic". This series ran until 2001.

Then-rights holder Egmont published a 64-page "collectors edition" of the comic strip in April 2009, gathering together a number of 1980's era Roy of the Rovers stories in addition to other backup strips from the comic. Two "Best of Roy of the Rovers" books, featuring successive runs of strips from the 1980s and 1970s, were published in June 2008 and 2009 respectively.

In 2016, the rights to Roy of the Rovers and the rest of the Fleetway comics library were acquired by <a href="Rebellion%20Developments">Rebellion Developments</a>, who subsequently relaunched the character in a series of graphic novels, depicting Roy as a teenager.

The story followed Roy Race, a <a href="Striker%20%28association%20football%29">striker</a> for the fictional football team Melchester Rovers, based in a town of the same name in an unspecified part of England, where Roy lived with his family. In the first episode, a teenaged Roy and his best friend, Blackie Gray, signed for the Rovers after being spotted playing for a youth club team. Eight months later, Roy and Blackie made their first-team debuts against Elbury Wanderers in a game that ended in a 3–3 draw, with Roy scoring twice. He soon became a star, leading the team to either the <a href="The%20Football%20League">Football League</a> title or a cup almost every season. In January 1975 he was made player-manager, a position he retained for most of the next 20 years. Although the strip followed the Rovers through nearly 40 seasons, Roy did not age at the same rate and appeared to be at most in his late thirties by the time the weekly comic ended. This unrealistic longevity was never remarked upon by the weekly comic, although the monthly comic attempted to address the anomaly by explaining that more than one Roy Race had played for Melchester over the years.

Roy won a number of trophies during his career with Rovers, including nine league titles, eight <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>s, three <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">League Cups</a>, three <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cups</a>, one <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a>, and four <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">Cup Winners' Cups</a>, and he also made several appearances for <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a>. He married club secretary Penny Laine at the end of the 1975–76 season, with whom he had three children: Roy Jr. (later known as Rocky), Melinda, and Diana. Penny left Roy in the early 1980s, in a high-profile storyline that was covered on national television news. The following year Roy was shot in his office by a mystery gunman, in an incident clearly mirroring the shooting of <a href="J.%20R.%20Ewing">J. R. Ewing</a> in the hit television series "<a href="Dallas%20%281978%20TV%20series%29">Dallas</a>" the previous year. Roy lay in a coma for several weeks. The culprit was eventually revealed to be Elton Blake, an actor who had been cast as Roy in a television series about the Rovers, but who blamed him for his dismissal. In early 1983 Roy swapped Melchester Rovers for ambitious London side Walford Rovers after a fallout with the Melchester directors, but his stint away was short-lived and he was back at his spiritual home by the end of the year. In July 1986 eight members of the Rovers team were killed during a club tour of the <a href="Fictional%20country">fictional Middle Eastern country</a> of Basran, when terrorists accidentally crashed a bomb-laden car into the team bus. Roy escaped with a dislocated shoulder. Author Mick Collins has commented that "Even as youngsters, we knew that this certainly bordered on bad taste, and probably overstepped the mark."
The final incident of Roy's playing career came in the closing pages of the last weekly issue, in March 1993, when he lost control of his helicopter and crashed into a field. Thus the weekly strip ended its 39-year unbroken run on a downbeat and unresolved <a href="cliffhanger">cliffhanger</a>, as Roy was taken into hospital while fans, the media and his family awaited news on his condition. The mystery of whether or not Roy had survived his crash was unresolved until the first issue of the new "Roy of the Rovers Monthly" in September 1993, in which readers discovered that the accident had resulted in the amputation of his famous left foot, ending his playing career and resulting in his move to Italy as the manager of <a href="Serie%20A">Serie A</a> side AC Monza (a fictional top-level Italian club, rather than <a href="A.C.%20Monza%20Brianza%201912">the real club of the same name</a>).

Reconciling the continuity of the monthly strip with the stories that preceded and followed it presented difficulties, forcing the story's writers to alter its history in a number of ways, a technique known as <a href="retroactive%20continuity">retroactive continuity</a>. Significantly, the strip rewrote various parts of Melchester's history, and shortened Roy Sr.'s recorded playing career to a more realistic level.

By the time the strip ended in March 1995 Melchester were in dire straits, on the verge of bankruptcy, and their long-term future far from certain. When the strip returned in "Match of the Day" magazine in May 1997, much of the monthly comic's new continuity was ignored, although the basic thread of the club having struggled against relegation and being severely in debt was continued. It was revealed in the first strip that in the intervening years, while Rovers had managed to survive the threat of bankruptcy, a bribery scandal had caused a mass exodus of players and eventual relegation to Division One. Rocky, meanwhile, was playing for fierce local rivals Melborough, after a bitter falling-out with his father over a car accident in Italy in which his mother, Penny, had been killed. Roy, who had quit football as a result, was blamed by some (including his son) for the accident, even though he had no memory of it, and the precise circumstances surrounding the event were never resolved.

Roy was persuaded to rejoin Melchester as manager and part-owner, backed by the unscrupulous Vinter brothers, and he arrived just in time to save the club from relegation. The following season, Roy and Rocky resolved their differences. Rocky rejoined Melchester, and the club was promoted back into the Premier League at the end of the year. When the magazine closed in 2001, Rovers were attempting to achieve a league placing that would secure them <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> football, giving them financial security. Although this storyline was never resolved, there was nevertheless a certain sense of closure as, shortly beforehand, Roy Sr. had wrested full control of the club from the Vinters, thus completing his 44-year progression from player to owner.

Over the years, the strip became famous for its employment of certain types of storyline and stylistic storytelling devices. For example, despite the fast-paced nature of a football match, exposition would be provided by members of the crowd apparently commenting to one another. Fans made lengthy comments in the short time it took the ball to travel through the air; as the ball was struck towards the goal a member of the crowd might be seen saying "Racey's had a shot!", followed by another responding "The 'keeper won't make it!". Nonetheless, loyal readers would usually suspend disbelief, a characteristic later parodied by "<a href="Viz%20%28comics%29">Viz</a>" magazine's <a href="Billy%20the%20Fish">Billy the Fish</a>, a fish with a human head who plays in goal for Fulchester United.

In the interests of keeping the strip exciting, it seemed that no season for Melchester Rovers could ever consist of mid-table obscurity. Almost every year, the club was either competing for the major honours at the top of the domestic and European game, or struggling against relegation to lower divisions. Often, such spells of good and bad fortune and form would directly succeed one another—a Rovers team that won the <a href="European%20Champion%20Clubs%27%20Cup">European Cup</a> one year could find itself struggling to stay in <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">Division One</a> the next.

Storylines often centred on new signings who were unable to settle easily in the Melchester team, either because they refused to change their style of play and expected the Rovers to play around them, such as the uncomprisingly tough defender Duncan McKay, or had personal characteristics that made it difficult for the other players to accept them, such as ex-circus ball juggler Sammy Spangler. As the average reader probably stayed with the comic for only three or four years, many storylines were recycled. For instance, during the first ten years of his playing career Roy was kidnapped at least five times.

When playing foreign teams, particularly in the European club competitions, the opposition would often cynically employ overt gamesmanship or downright dirty tactics. Continental sides were considered to be "sneaky":

The strip followed the structure of the football season, thus there were several months each year when the Rovers were not playing football, but the strip needed to depict something more exciting than the players going on holiday and then reporting for pre-season training. As a result, the players tended to spend their summers involved in activities such as competing in charity cricket tournaments, but by far the most common summer storyline saw the Rovers go on tour to a fictional country in an exotic part of the world, normally South America, where they would invariably be kidnapped and held to ransom. "Melchester played more pre-season games at gunpoint deep in the jungle than they ever did in more mundane settings." The summer would often also see Roy fending off lucrative offers to leave Melchester, as in 1978, when the Sheik of Basran, an oil-rich Middle-Eastern state, offered him £1 million to coach the national team.

Especially during the 1980s, real-life personalities often made appearances. Former Division One stars <a href="Bob%20Wilson%20%28footballer%20born%201941%29">Bob Wilson</a> and <a href="Emlyn%20Hughes">Emlyn Hughes</a> were brought out of retirement to play for Melchester in 1985, along with longtime fans of the strip <a href="Martin%20Kemp%20%28entertainer%29">Martin Kemp</a> and <a href="Steve%20Norman">Steve Norman</a>, of the pop group <a href="Spandau%20Ballet">Spandau Ballet</a>. <a href="Geoff%20Boycott">Geoff Boycott</a> served for several years as Melchester's chairman, and Sir <a href="Alf%20Ramsey">Alf Ramsey</a> had briefly taken over as manager of Melchester in 1982, while Roy lay in his coma. Players such as <a href="Malcolm%20Macdonald">Malcolm Macdonald</a> and <a href="Trevor%20Francis">Trevor Francis</a> would sometimes line up alongside Roy in England matches, despite the fact that the clubs they played for in real life were never featured in the strip.

The concept of TV pundits and anchormen making appearances was a later development. When Roy announced his resignation as Rovers manager in 1992, he did so live on <a href="Sky%20Sports">Sky Sports</a> in front of shocked presenters <a href="Richard%20Keys">Richard Keys</a> and <a href="Andy%20Gray%20%28footballer%20born%201955%29">Andy Gray</a>.

Roy was created by the author <a href="Frank%20S.%20Pepper">Frank S. Pepper</a>, who had created the similar strip, Danny of the Dazzlers, but he only wrote four instalments of Roy of the Rovers, because of his commitments to another of his characters, Captain Condor. His role was taken by the strip's first artist <a href="Joe%20Colquhoun">Joe Colquhoun</a>, who used the pen-name "Stewart Colwyn". He was replaced after four-and-a-half years by <a href="Derek%20Birnage">Derek Birnage</a>, the editor of "Tiger", who had commissioned the strip. In 1960, in an attempt to whip up publicity, it was announced that the footballer <a href="Bobby%20Charlton">Bobby Charlton</a> had taken over as writer, although in reality it was still written by Birnage (who claimed that he did consult with Charlton occasionally for story ideas). The longest-serving writer of the strip was <a href="Tom%20Tully%20%28comic%20writer%29">Tom Tully</a>, who began in 1969 on an intermittent basis and then continuously from 1974 until the end of the weekly comic in 1993. Ian Rimmer became the main writer for the strip during the "Match of the Day" years, until the magazine's closure in May 2001.

After Joe Colquhoun departed, he was succeeded first by <a href="Paul%20Trevillion">Paul Trevillion</a>, then by <a href="Yvonne%20Hutton">Yvonne Hutton</a>, who illustrated from 1967 to 1974, before <a href="David%20Sque">David Sque</a> took over in 1975. Despite reportedly not being a football fan, he was responsible for one of the strip's more definitive looks in its early '80s period. He was replaced in 1986 by former "<a href="2000%20AD%20%28comics%29">2000 AD</a>" artist Mike White, who gave Roy a more muscular look and the strip a more modern feel. Barrie Mitchell took over in 1992, with a style quite similar to White's. A number of artists worked on the monthly comic, such as David Jukes, Sean Longcroft and Garry Marshall, in contrast to the lengthy tenures of the weekly strip's creative team. <a href="Tony%20Harding">Tony Harding</a> often illustrated Roy for the Roy of the Rovers annuals and also drew the Roy's Action Replay strip that appeared in All Action Monthly in the late eighties (Fleetway). Mitchell returned in 1997 as the sole artist of the "Match of the Day" strips for all four years.

Filmmakers <a href="Luke%20Dormehl">Luke Dormehl</a> and <a href="Tom%20Atkinson">Tom Atkinson</a>, released a documentary called "Roy" in 2008, featuring interviews with some of the key members of the Roy of the Rovers creative team. The film was shown at <a href="The%20End%20of%20the%20Pier%20International%20Film%20Festival">The End of the Pier International Film Festival</a> in 2009, where it won the prize for Best Documentary Short.

The phrase "Roy of the Rovers" has become a <a href="trope%20%28linguistics%29">trope</a> familiar to generations of British football fans and sports commentators, used to describe a memorable sporting achievement such as winning against the odds, or an unexpected comeback. "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" newspaper of 10 April 1995, for instance, described future England captain <a href="Alan%20Shearer">Alan Shearer</a> as "the classic working class sporting hero ... everything legend demands an English centre-forward should be ... As a striker he comes closer to fitting the "Roy of the Rovers" fantasy than anyone else lately admired by English crowds". Shearer was at that time the leading goal-scorer for "unfashionable" <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers F.C.</a>, who were on the verge of winning the Premiership title.

Comparisons have been drawn between the fictional Roy Race and the captain of England's 1966 World Cup winning team, <a href="Bobby%20Moore">Bobby Moore</a>, whose playing career spanned a similar time-scale to that of Roy's. Moore's death in 1993, just days after the last edition of the "Roy of the Rovers" comic was published, produced a "literature of tribute", framed around themes "remarkably similar to those at the center of the Roy Race fiction and ideology ... there was a clear sense of mourning for the loss of an age".
"Roy of the Rovers Annual"s were produced every year from 1958 until 1994, and again in 2000. A number of tie-in books were also published, including a handful of paperback prose storybooks in 1977 and 1993, and two football quiz books in 1978 and 1979. Roy of the Rovers never made the leap from page to screen, although he did make an appearance on the BBC comedy sports quiz "<a href="They%20Think%20It%27s%20All%20Over%20%28TV%20series%29">They Think It's All Over</a>" in 1999, in the form of a cardboard cut-out.

A "Roy of the Rovers" computer game was released, on the <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore 64</a>, <a href="Amstrad%20CPC">Amstrad CPC</a> and <a href="ZX%20Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a> in 1988. It was split into two parts: the first an adventure game, in which – taking the role of Roy Race – the player had to find and rescue the kidnapped Melchester team, before then playing the second part, which consisted of a charity match to raise funds for the club. The fewer players recovered before the match began, then the smaller the team who could take part. In the extreme, Roy would be the only player for Melchester. The game received mixed reactions; the Spectrum version received 7/10 from "<a href="Your%20Sinclair">Your Sinclair</a>", but only 3/10 from "<a href="Sinclair%20User">Sinclair User</a>".

A number of official Melchester Rovers <a href="Subbuteo">Subbuteo</a> teams were produced in the 1980s and 1990s. There was also an officially licensed board game in the 1980s, which saw players take on the role of Roy Race and manage the club. The Old Fashioned Football Shirt Company now makes officially licensed replica shirts.

In 1990, "Roy Race" and footballer <a href="Gary%20Lineker">Gary Lineker</a> released a single, "Europe United", described in the comic as "a hot rocking heavy metal rap", which failed to chart in the <a href="UK%20Top%2040">UK Top 40</a>. The confectionery company McCowans produced a pineapple-flavoured "Roy of the Rovers" chew bar in the 1990s.

On 29 February 2008 it was announced that <a href="Titan%20Books">Titan Books</a> had acquired worldwide book publishing rights to a range of Egmont's comic strips, including Roy of the Rovers. The first of their compilations of Roy's playing days, "The Best of Roy of the Rovers: The 1980s" was released in May 2008 and included the "Relegation" and "Who Shot Roy" story arcs. "The Bumper Book of Roy of the Rovers" was published in October 2008, and reprinted strips, articles, short stories and features taken from Roy annuals dated from 1957 to 1971. Two further titles were released in 2009, "The Best of the 1970s and The Second Bumper Book", and a third "Best of", focusing on the World Cup, was released in 2010. All five of the titles were edited and compiled by David Leach.

Thomas Blamey

<a href="Field%20marshal%20%28Australia%29">Field Marshal</a> Sir Thomas Albert Blamey, (24 January 188427 May 1951) was an Australian general of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First</a> and <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>s, and the only Australian to attain the rank of field marshal.

Blamey joined the Australian Army as a regular soldier in 1906, and attended the <a href="Command%20and%20Staff%20College">Staff College at Quetta</a>. During the First World War he participated in the <a href="landing%20at%20Anzac%20Cove">landing at Anzac Cove</a> on 25 April 1915, and served as a staff officer in the <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli Campaign</a>, where he was <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a> for a daring raid behind enemy lines. He later served on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>, where he distinguished himself in the planning for the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pozi%C3%A8res">Battle of Pozières</a>. He rose to the rank of <a href="brigadier%20general">brigadier general</a>, and served as chief of staff of the <a href="Australian%20Corps">Australian Corps</a> under <a href="Lieutenant%20general%20%28Australia%29">Lieutenant General</a> Sir <a href="John%20Monash">John Monash</a>, who credited him as a factor in the Corps' success in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hamel">Battle of Hamel</a>, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Amiens%20%281918%29">Battle of Amiens</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Hindenburg%20Line">Battle of the Hindenburg Line</a>.

After the war Blamey was <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Army%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of the General Staff</a>, and was involved in the creation of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a>. He resigned from the regular Army in 1925 to become <a href="Police%20commissioner">Chief Commissioner</a> of the <a href="Victoria%20Police">Victoria Police</a>, but remained in the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">Militia</a>, rising to command the <a href="3rd%20Division%20%28Australia%29">3rd Division</a> in 1931. As chief commissioner, Blamey set about dealing with the grievances that had led to the <a href="1923%20Victorian%20Police%20strike">1923 Victorian Police strike</a>, and implemented innovations such as police dogs and equipping vehicles with radios. His tenure as chief commissioner was marred by a scandal in which his police badge was found in a brothel, and a later attempt to cover up the shooting of a police officer led to his forced resignation in 1936. He later made weekly broadcasts on international affairs on Melbourne radio station <a href="3UZ">3UZ</a>. Appointed chairman of the Commonwealth Government's Manpower Committee and controller general of recruiting in 1938, he headed a successful recruiting campaign which doubled the size of the part-time volunteer Militia.

During the Second World War Blamey commanded the <a href="Second%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Second Australian Imperial Force</a> and the <a href="I%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">I Corps</a> in the Middle East. In the latter role he commanded Australian and Commonwealth troops in the disastrous <a href="Battle%20of%20Greece">Battle of Greece</a>. In the former role, he attempted to protect Australian interests against British commanders who sought to disperse his forces on all manner of missions. He was appointed deputy commander-in-chief of <a href="Middle%20East%20Command">Middle East Command</a>, and was promoted to <a href="General%20%28Australia%29">general</a> in 1941. In 1942, he returned to Australia as commander-in-chief of the <a href="Australian%20Military%20Forces">Australian Military Forces</a> and commander of Allied Land Forces in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area">South West Pacific Area</a> under the command of <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>. On the orders of MacArthur and <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister</a> <a href="John%20Curtin">John Curtin</a>, he assumed personal command of <a href="New%20Guinea%20Force">New Guinea Force</a> during the <a href="Kokoda%20Track%20campaign">Kokoda Track campaign</a>, and relieved Lieutenant General <a href="Sydney%20Rowell">Sydney Rowell</a> and <a href="Major%20General%20%28Australia%29">Major General</a> <a href="Arthur%20Samuel%20Allen">Arthur Allen</a> under controversial circumstances. Blamey also planned and carried out the significant and victorious <a href="Salamaua%E2%80%93Lae%20Campaign">Salamaua–Lae Campaign</a>. Nonetheless, during the final campaigns of the war he faced vociferous criticism of the Army's performance. He signed the <a href="Japanese%20Instrument%20of%20Surrender">Japanese Instrument of Surrender</a> on behalf of Australia at Japan's ceremonial surrender in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945, and later personally accepted the Japanese surrender at <a href="Morotai">Morotai</a> on 9 September. He was promoted to field marshal in June 1950.

The seventh of ten children, Blamey was born on 24 January 1884 in <a href="Lake%20Albert%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Lake Albert</a>, near <a href="Wagga%20Wagga">Wagga Wagga</a>, <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>. He was the son of Richard Blamey, a farmer who had emigrated from <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a> at the age of 16 in 1862, and his Australian-born wife, Margaret (née Murray). After farming failures in Queensland and on the <a href="Murrumbidgee%20River">Murrumbidgee River</a> near Wagga Wagga, his father Richard moved to a small property in Lake Albert, where he supplemented his farm income working as a drover and shearing overseer.

Blamey acquired the bush skills associated with his father's enterprises and became a sound horseman. He attended Wagga Wagga Superior Public School (now Wagga Wagga Public School), where he played <a href="Australian%20football">Australian football</a>, and was a keen member of the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Cadets">Army Cadet</a> unit. He transferred to Wagga Wagga Grammar when he was 13, and was head cadet of its unit for two years.

Blamey began his working life in 1899 as a trainee school teacher at Lake Albert School. He transferred to South Wagga Public School in 1901, and in 1903 moved to Western Australia, where he taught for three years at Fremantle Boys School. He coached the rifle shooting team of its cadet unit there to a win in the Western Australian Cup. He was raised in the <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a> faith and remained involved with his church. By early 1906 he was a lay preacher, and church leaders in Western Australia offered him an appointment as an associate minister in <a href="Carnarvon%2C%20Western%20Australia">Carnarvon, Western Australia</a>.

With the creation of the Cadet Instructional Staff of the <a href="Australian%20Military%20Forces">Australian Military Forces</a>, Blamey saw a new opportunity. He sat the exam and came third in Australia, but failed to secure an appointment as there were no vacancies in Western Australia. After correspondence with the military authorities he persuaded the Deputy Assistant Adjutant General, Major <a href="Julius%20Bruche">Julius Bruche</a>, that he should be given the option of taking up an appointment for one of the vacancies in another state. He was appointed to a position in Victoria with the rank of <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a>, commencing duty in November 1906 with responsibility for school cadets in Victoria, and was confirmed in his rank and appointment the following 29 June.

In Melbourne, Blamey met Minnie Millard, the daughter of a <a href="Toorak%2C%20Victoria">Toorak</a> stockbroker who was involved in the Methodist Church there. They were married at her home on 8 September 1909. His first child was born on 29 June 1910, and named Charles Middleton after a friend of Blamey's who had died in a shooting accident; but the boy was always called Dolf by his family. A second child, a boy named Thomas, was born four years later.

Blamey was promoted to <a href="captain%20%28OF-2%29">captain</a> on 1 December 1910, and became <a href="brigade%20major">brigade major</a> of the 12th Brigade Area. He then set his sights on attending staff college. There were two British staff colleges, at <a href="Staff%20College%2C%20Camberley">Camberley</a> in England and <a href="Command%20and%20Staff%20College">Quetta</a> in India, and from 1908 one position was set aside for the Australian Army at each every year. No Australian officers managed to pass the demanding entrance examinations, but this requirement was waived to allow them to attend. In 1911, Blamey became the first Australian officer to pass the entrance examination. He commenced his studies at Quetta in 1912, and performed very well, completing the course in December 1913.

The usual practice was for Australian staff college graduates to follow their training with a posting to a <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> or <a href="British%20Indian%20Army">British Indian Army</a> headquarters. He was initially attached to the 4th Battalion, <a href="King%27s%20Royal%20Rifle%20Corps">King's Royal Rifle Corps</a> at <a href="Rawalpindi">Rawalpindi</a>, and then the staff of the <a href="Kohat%20Brigade">Kohat Brigade</a> on the <a href="North-West%20Frontier%20Province%20%281901%E2%80%9355%29">North-West Frontier</a>. Finally, he was assigned to the General Staff at Army Headquarters at <a href="Shimal">Shimal</a>. In May 1914, he was sent to Britain for more training, while his family returned home to Australia. He visited Turkey (including the Dardanelles), Belgium, and the battlefields of the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a> en route. In England he spent a brief time on attachment to the <a href="4th%20Dragoon%20Guards">4th Dragoon Guards</a> at <a href="Tidworth%20Camp">Tidworth</a> before taking up duties on the staff of the <a href="British%2043rd%20%28Wessex%29%20Division">Wessex Division</a>, at that time entering its annual camp. On 1 July 1914, he was promoted to <a href="major%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">major</a>.

Following the outbreak of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> in August 1914, Blamey was transferred to the <a href="War%20Office">War Office</a>, where he worked in the <a href="military%20intelligence">Intelligence Branch</a> preparing daily summaries for the <a href="George%20V%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King</a> and the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20War">Secretary of State for War</a>, <a href="Horatio%20Kitchener%2C%201st%20Earl%20Kitchener">Lord Kitchener</a>. Fully trained staff officers were rare and valuable in the Australian Army, and while still in Britain, Blamey was appointed to the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF) as general staff officer, Grade 3 (Intelligence), on the staff of Major General <a href="William%20Bridges%20%28general%29">William Bridges</a>'s <a href="1st%20Division%20%28Australia%29">1st Division</a>. As such, he reported to the 1st Division's GSO1, <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> <a href="Brudenell%20White">Brudenell White</a>. In November 1914 he sailed for Egypt with <a href="Colonel">Colonel</a> <a href="Harry%20Chauvel">Harry Chauvel</a>, to join the Australian contingent there. His appointment as GSO 3 was confirmed with effect from 10 December.

Along with Bridges, White, and other members of 1st Division headquarters, Blamey left the battleship in a trawler and <a href="Landing%20at%20Anzac%20Cove">landed on the beach at Anzac Cove</a> at 07:20 on 25 April 1915. He was sent to evaluate the need for reinforcements by Colonel <a href="James%20McCay">James McCay</a>'s 2nd Brigade on the <a href="Lone%20Pine%20%28tree%29">400 Plateau</a>. He confirmed that they were needed, and the reinforcements were sent.
On the night of 13 May 1915, Blamey, in his capacity as 1st Division intelligence officer, led a patrol consisting of himself, <a href="Sergeant">Sergeant</a> J. H. Will and <a href="Bombardier%20%28rank%29">Bombardier</a> A. A. Orchard, behind the Turkish lines in an effort to locate the Olive Grove guns that had been harassing the beach. Near Pine Ridge, an enemy party of eight Turks approached; when one of them went to bayonet Orchard, Blamey shot the Turk with his revolver. In the action that followed, six Turks were killed. He withdrew his patrol back to the Australian lines without locating the guns. For this action, he was <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a>.

Blamey was always interested in technical innovation, and was receptive to unorthodox ideas. He was instrumental in the adoption of the <a href="periscope%20rifle">periscope rifle</a> at Gallipoli, a device which he saw during an inspection of the front line. He arranged for the inventor, <a href="Lance%20Corporal">Lance Corporal</a> W. C. B. Beech, to be seconded to division headquarters to develop the idea. Within a few days, the design was perfected and periscope rifles began to be used throughout the Australian trenches.

On 21 July 1915 Blamey was given a staff appointment as a general staff officer, Grade 2 (GSO2), with the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel. and with effect from 2 August joined the staff of the newly formed <a href="Australian%202nd%20Division%20%28World%20War%20I%29">2nd Division</a> in Egypt as its assistant adjutant and quartermaster general (AA&QMG) – the senior administrative officer of the division. Its commander, Major General <a href="James%20Gordon%20Legge">James Gordon Legge</a>, preferred to have an Australian colonel in this post as he felt that a British officer might not take such good care of the troops. The 2nd Division Headquarters embarked for Gallipoli on 29 August 1915, but Blamey was forced to remain in Egypt as he had just had an operation for <a href="haemorrhoids">haemorrhoids</a>. He finally returned to Anzac on 25 October 1915, remaining for the rest of the campaign.

After the Australian forces moved to the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> in 1916, Blamey returned to the 1st Division as GSO1 on 10 July. At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pozi%C3%A8res">Battle of Pozières</a>, he developed the plan of attack which captured the town, for which he received another mention in despatches, and was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> in the <a href="1917%20New%20Year%20Honours">1917 New Year Honours</a>. He was considered as a possible brigade commander, but he had never commanded a battalion, which was usually regarded as a prerequisite for brigade command. He was therefore appointed to command the <a href="2nd%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2nd Infantry Battalion</a> on 3 December 1916. On 28 December, Blamey, as senior ranking battalion commander, took over as acting commander of the <a href="1st%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">1st Infantry Brigade</a>. On 9 January 1917, he went on leave, handing over command to Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Iven%20Mackay">Iven Mackay</a>. However, when General Headquarters (GHQ) <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20I%29">BEF</a> found out about this use of a staff college graduate, it reminded <a href="I%20ANZAC%20Corps">I ANZAC Corps</a> that "it is inadvisable to release such officers for command of battalions unless they have proved to be unequal to their duties on staff".

Blamey therefore returned to 1st Division Headquarters. <a href="Lieutenant-general%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Lieutenant General</a> Sir <a href="William%20Birdwood">William Birdwood</a> did, however, promote Blamey to full colonel, backdated to 1 December 1916, thereby making him technically senior to a number of recently promoted <a href="brigadier%20general">brigadier general</a>s, that rank being only held temporarily. His division commander, Major General <a href="Harold%20Bridgwood%20Walker">H. B. Walker</a>, had Blamey mentioned in despatches for this period of battalion and brigade command, although the battalion had spent most of the time out of the line and there had been no significant engagements. Blamey was also acting commander of the 2nd Brigade during a rest period from 27 August to 4 September 1917. On 8 September he was hospitalised with vomiting and coughing. He was sent to England where he was admitted to the 3rd London General Hospital for treatment for debilitating <a href="psoriasis">psoriasis</a> on 22 September, and did not return to duty until 8 November 1917, by which time he had been promoted to brevet lieutenant-colonel on 24 September. He was made a <a href="Companion%20of%20St%20Michael%20and%20St%20George">Companion of St Michael and St George</a> in the 1918 New Year's list, and received another mention in despatches in May 1918.

On 1 June 1918, Lieutenant General <a href="John%20Monash">John Monash</a> succeeded Birdwood as commander of the <a href="Australian%20Corps">Australian Corps</a>, and Blamey was promoted to the rank of brigadier general to replace White as the corps Brigadier General General Staff (BGGS). He played a significant role in the success of the Australian Corps in the final months of the war. He remained interested in technological innovation. He was impressed by the capabilities of the new models of <a href="tank">tank</a>s. and pressed for their use in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hamel">Battle of Hamel</a>, where they played an important part in the success of the battle. Monash acknowledged Blamey's role in the Australian Corps' success in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Amiens%20%281918%29">Battle of Amiens</a> in August and the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Hindenburg%20Line">Battle of the Hindenburg Line</a> in September. The Major General General Staff (MGGS) of the <a href="Fourth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British Fourth Army</a>, of which the Australian Corps was a part during these battles, Major General <a href="Archibald%20Montgomery-Massingberd">Archibald Montgomery-Massingberd</a>, was a former instructor of Blamey's at Quetta. He declared himself "full of admiration for the staff work of the Australian Corps." Monash later wrote:
Blamey's loyalty to Monash would continue after the latter's death in 1931. For his services as Corps Chief of Staff, Blamey was appointed <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> in 1919, mentioned in despatches twice more, and was awarded the French <a href="Croix%20de%20guerre%201914%E2%80%931918%20%28France%29">Croix de guerre</a>.

Blamey arrived back in Australia on 20 October 1919 after an absence of seven years, and became director of Military Operations at Army Headquarters in Melbourne. His AIF appointment was terminated on 19 December 1919, and on 1 January 1920, he was simultaneously confirmed in the rank of lieutenant-colonel and promoted to substantive colonel, also receiving the honorary rank of brigadier-general with effect from 1 June 1918. In May 1920, he was appointed <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Army%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of the General Staff</a>.

His first major task was the creation of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF). The government established a joint Army–Navy board to provide recommendations on the matter, with Blamey and Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Richard%20Williams%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Richard Williams</a> as the Army representatives. Blamey supported the creation of a separate air force, albeit one still subordinate to the Army and Navy. He refused to yield, however, on his opposition to the Navy's demand that Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Stanley%20Goble">Stanley Goble</a> become its first chief.

In November 1922 Blamey embarked for London to be the Australian representative on the <a href="Imperial%20General%20Staff">Imperial General Staff</a>. He reported that the "conception of an Imperial General Staff ... was absolutely dead". The British Army saw little use in the concept of a combined staff which could coordinate the defence of the British Empire. He became involved with the development of the <a href="Singapore%20strategy">Singapore strategy</a>, and he briefed Prime Minister <a href="Stanley%20Bruce">Stanley Bruce</a> on it for the <a href="1923%20Imperial%20Conference">1923 Imperial Conference</a>, at which it was formally adopted. Even in 1923, though, Blamey was sceptical about the strategy.

When White retired as Chief of General Staff in 1923, Blamey was widely expected to succeed him, as he had as chief of staff of the Australian Corps in France, but there were objections from more senior officers, particularly Major General <a href="Victor%20Sellheim">Victor Sellheim</a>, at being passed over. Instead, the Inspector General, Lieutenant General Sir Harry Chauvel, was made Chief of General Staff as well, while Blamey was given the new post of Second CGS, in which he performed most of the duties of Chief of General Staff.

Seeing no immediate prospects for advancement, Blamey transferred from the Permanent Military Forces to the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">Militia</a> on 1 September 1925. For the next 14 years he would remain in the Army as a part-time soldier. On 1 May 1926 he assumed command of the <a href="10th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">10th Infantry Brigade</a>, part of the <a href="3rd%20Division%20%28Australia%29">3rd Division</a>. Blamey stepped up to command the 3rd Division on 23 March 1931, and was promoted to major general, one of only four Militia officers promoted to this rank between 1929 and 1939. In 1937 he was transferred to the unattached list.

In 1923, the <a href="Victoria%20Police">Victoria Police</a> <a href="1923%20Victorian%20Police%20strike">went on strike</a>, and Monash and McCay established a Special Constabulary Force to carry out police duties. After the Chief Commissioner, Alexander Nicholson, resigned for ill-health in 1925, Chauvel recommended Blamey for the post. He became Chief Commissioner on 1 September 1925 for a five-year term, with a salary of £1,500 per annum (A$ in 2008 dollars). Blamey set about addressing the grievances that had caused the strike, which he felt "were just, even if they went the wrong way about them". Blamey improved pay and conditions, and implemented the recommendations of the Royal Commission into the strike. He attempted to introduce faster promotion based on merit, but this was unpopular with the <a href="Police%20Association%20Victoria">Police Association</a>, and was abandoned by his successors. As in the Army, he showed a willingness to adopt new ideas. He introduced police dogs, and increased the number of police cars equipped with two-way radios from one in 1925 to five in 1930. He also boosted the numbers of policewomen on the force.

Blamey became involved in his first and greatest scandal soon after taking office. During a raid on a brothel in <a href="Fitzroy%2C%20Victoria">Fitzroy</a> on 21 October 1925, the police encountered a man who produced Blamey's police badge, No. 80. Blamey later said that he had given his key ring, which included his badge, to a friend who had served with him in France, so that the man could help himself to some alcohol in Blamey's locker at the Naval and Military Club. His story was corroborated by his friend <a href="Stanley%20Savige">Stanley Savige</a>, who was with him at the time. Blamey protected the man in question, who he said was married with children, and refused to identify him. The man has never been identified, but the description given by the detectives and the brothel owner did not match Blamey.

During the 1920s, Victoria had repressive and restrictive drinking laws, including the notorious <a href="six%20o%27clock%20closing">six o'clock closing</a>. Blamey took the position that it was the job of the police to enforce the laws, even if they did not support them. Many members of the public did not agree with this attitude, maintaining that the police should not uphold such laws. Almost as controversially, Blamey drew a sharp distinction between his personal life and his job. His presence in a hotel after closing time was always welcome, as it meant that drinking could continue, for it was known that it would not be raided while he was there; but other citizens felt that it was unjust when they were arrested for breaking the same laws.

As Police Commissioner Blamey defended the actions of the police during the 1928 <a href="Waterside%20Workers%27%20Federation">Waterside Workers' Federation</a> dispute, during which police opened fire, killing a striking worker who was also a Gallipoli veteran, and wounding several others. His treatment of the unionists was typical of his hard line anti-<a href="communism">communist</a> beliefs and as such his relations with left-wing governments were tense. Along with many senior army and ex-army officers, he was a leading member of the clandestine far-right-wing League of National Security. This was reportedly a response to the rise of communism in Australia. Its members stood ready to take up arms to stop a Catholic or communist revolution.
Blamey was re-appointed as Chief Commissioner in 1930, but at a reduced salary of £1,250 per annum. A year later it was reduced still further, to £785, due to cutbacks as a result of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>. Minnie became an invalid, and by 1930 no longer accompanied him in public. His son Dolf, now an <a href="RAAF">RAAF</a> <a href="flying%20officer">flying officer</a>, was killed in an air crash at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Base Richmond</a> in October 1932, and Minnie died in October 1935. Blamey was <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighted</a> in the <a href="1935%20New%20Year%20Honours">1935 New Year Honours</a>, and in 1936 he was appointed a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Venerable%20Order%20of%20Saint%20John">Commander of the Venerable Order of Saint John</a>.

A second scandal occurred in 1936 when Blamey attempted to cover up details of the shooting of the superintendent of the Criminal Investigation Branch, John O'Connell Brophy, whom Blamey had appointed to the post. The story put about was that Brophy had taken two women friends and a chauffeur along with him to a meeting with a police informant. While they were waiting for the informant, they had been approached by armed bandits, and Brophy had opened fire and had himself been wounded. In order to cover up the identities of the two women involved, Blamey initially issued a press release to the effect that Brophy had accidentally shot himself (three times). The <a href="Premier%20of%20Victoria">Premier</a>, <a href="Albert%20Dunstan">Albert Dunstan</a>, gave Blamey the choice of resigning or being dismissed. The latter meant the loss of pension rights and any future prospects of employment in the Public Service or the Army. He reluctantly submitted his resignation on 9 July 1936.

From March 1938 Blamey supplemented his income by making weekly broadcasts on international affairs on Melbourne radio station <a href="3UZ">3UZ</a> under the pseudonym "the Sentinel". Like the station's general manager, <a href="Alfred%20Kemsley">Alfred Kemsley</a>, Blamey felt that Australians were poorly informed about international affairs, and set about raising awareness of matters that he believed would soon impact them greatly. He was appalled at <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>'s persecution of Jews, and saw a clear and growing menace to world peace from both Germany and the <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japan</a>. His 15-minute weekly talks continued until the end of September 1939, by which time the war that he had warned was coming had started.

In November 1938, Blamey was appointed chairman of the Commonwealth Government's Manpower Committee and Controller General of Recruiting. As such, he laid the foundation for the expansion of the Army in the event of war with Germany or Japan, which he now regarded as inevitable. In 1938 and 1939, he headed a successful recruiting campaign which doubled the size of the part-time volunteer Militia from 35,000 in September 1938 to 70,000 in March 1939. On 5 April 1939 he married Olga Ora Farnsworth, a 35-year-old fashion artist, at St John's Anglican Church, Toorak.

<a href="Henry%20Somer%20Gullett">Henry Somer Gullett</a> and <a href="Richard%20Gardiner%20Casey%2C%20Baron%20Casey">Richard Casey</a>, who had served with Blamey at Gallipoli and in France, put Blamey's name forward to <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Joseph%20Lyons">Joseph Lyons</a> as a possible commander in chief in the event of a major war. "We've got some brilliant staff officers," Casey told Lyons, "but Blamey is a commander. That's the difference." Lyons initially had concerns about Blamey's morals, but Casey and Lyons summoned Blamey to a meeting in Canberra, after which Lyons designated him for the job. Lyons died on 7 April 1939, and was replaced as prime minister by <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a>, another prominent supporter of Blamey's. Two other officers, Major Generals <a href="Gordon%20Bennett%20%28general%29">Gordon Bennett</a> and <a href="John%20Lavarack">John Lavarack</a>, were considered, and also had strong and well-connected supporters, but unlike Blamey they were public critics of the government's defence policies.

On 13 October 1939, a month after the outbreak of the Second World War, Blamey was promoted to lieutenant general, and appointed to command the <a href="Australian%206th%20Division">6th Division</a>, the first formation of the new <a href="Second%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Second Australian Imperial Force</a>, and received the AIF service number VX1. Menzies limited his choice of commanders by insisting that they be selected from the Militia rather than the Permanent Military Forces (PMF), the Army's full-time, regular component. For brigade commanders he chose <a href="Brigadier">Brigadier</a>s <a href="Arthur%20Samuel%20Allen">Arthur Allen</a>, <a href="Leslie%20Morshead">Leslie Morshead</a> and Stanley Savige. He selected Brigadier <a href="Edmund%20Herring">Edmund Herring</a> to command the 6th Division artillery, Colonel <a href="Samuel%20Burston">Samuel Burston</a> for its medical services, and Lieutenant Colonels <a href="Clive%20Steele">Clive Steele</a> and <a href="Jack%20Stevens">Jack Stevens</a> for its engineers and signals. All except Allen had previously served with him during his time commanding the 3rd Division in Melbourne. For his two most senior staff officers, he chose two PMF officers, Colonel <a href="Sydney%20Rowell">Sydney Rowell</a> as GSO1 and Lieutenant Colonel <a href="George%20Alan%20Vasey">George Alan Vasey</a> as AA&QMG.

In February 1940, the <a href="War%20Cabinet">War Cabinet</a> decided to form a second AIF division, the <a href="Australian%207th%20Division">7th Division</a>, and group the 6th and 7th Divisions together as <a href="I%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">I Corps</a>, with Blamey as its commander. On Blamey's recommendation, Major General Iven Mackay was appointed to succeed him in command of the 6th Division, while Lieutenant General John Lavarack, a PMF officer, assumed command of the 7th Division. Blamey took Rowell with him as his corps chief of staff, and picked Major General <a href="Henry%20Wynter">Henry Wynter</a> as his administrative officer. Blamey flew to <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a> on a <a href="Qantas">Qantas</a> <a href="flying%20boat">flying boat</a> in June 1940. He refused to allow his troops to perform police duties in Palestine, and established warm relations with the Jewish community there, becoming a frequent guest in their homes.

As commander of the AIF, Blamey was answerable directly to the <a href="Minister%20for%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Minister of Defence</a>, rather than to the Military Board, with a charter based on that given to Bridges in 1914. Part of this required that his forces remain together as cohesive units, and that no Australian forces were to be deployed or engaged without the prior consent of the Australian government. Blamey was not inflexible, and permitted Australian units to be detached when there was a genuine military need. Because the situation in the Middle East lurched from crisis to crisis, this resulted in his troops becoming widely scattered at times. When the crises had passed, however, he wanted units returned to their parent formations. This resulted in conflicts with British commanders. The first occurred in August 1940 when the British <a href="Commander%20in%20Chief">Commander in Chief</a> <a href="Middle%20East%20Command">Middle East Command</a>, General Sir <a href="Archibald%20Wavell">Archibald Wavell</a>, and <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</a>, <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, ordered the <a href="16th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">16th Infantry Brigade</a> to move to Egypt. Blamey refused on the grounds that the brigade was not yet fully equipped, but eventually compromised, sending it on the understanding that it would soon be joined by the rest of the 6th Division.
I Corps assumed responsibility for the front in <a href="Cyrenaica">Cyrenaica</a> on 15 February 1941, but within days Blamey was informed that his troops would be sent on the <a href="Battle%20of%20Greece">expedition to Greece</a>. Blamey has been criticised for allowing this when he knew it was extremely hazardous, after he was told that Menzies had approved. He insisted, however, on sending the veteran 6th Division first instead of the 7th Division, resulting in a heated argument with Wavell, which Blamey won. He was under no illusions about the odds of success, and immediately prepared plans for an evacuation. His foresight and determination saved many of his men, but he lost credibility when he chose his son Tom to fill the one remaining seat on the aircraft carrying him out of Greece. The campaign exposed deficiencies in the Australian Army's training, leadership and staff work that had passed unnoticed or had not been addressed in the <a href="Operation%20Compass">Libyan Campaign</a>. The pressure of the campaign opened a rift between Blamey and Rowell, which was to have important consequences. While Rowell and Brigadier <a href="William%20Bridgeford">William Bridgeford</a> were extremely critical of Blamey's performance in Greece, this opinion was not widely held. Wavell reported that "Blamey has shown himself a fine fighting commander in these operations and fitted for high command."

The political fallout from the disastrous Battle of Greece led to Blamey's appointment as Deputy Commander in Chief <a href="Middle%20East%20Command">Middle East Command</a> in April 1941. However, to ensure that command would not pass to Blamey in the event of something happening to Wavell, the British government promoted Sir <a href="Henry%20Maitland%20Wilson">Henry Maitland Wilson</a> to <a href="General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">general</a> in June. Soon afterwards, Wavell was replaced by General Sir <a href="Claude%20Auchinleck">Claude Auchinleck</a>. Blamey was subsequently promoted to the same rank on 24 September 1941, becoming only the fourth Australian to reach this rank, after Monash, Chauvel and White. During the <a href="Syrian%20campaign">Syrian campaign</a> against the <a href="Vichy%20France">Vichy French</a>, Blamey took decisive action to resolve the command difficulties caused by Wilson's attempt to direct the fighting from the <a href="King%20David%20Hotel">King David Hotel</a> in <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> by interposing Lavarack's I Corps headquarters.

During Blamey's absence in Greece, AIF units had become widely scattered, with forces being deployed to <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, and the <a href="Australian%209th%20Division">9th Division</a> and the <a href="18th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">18th Infantry Brigade</a> coming under <a href="Siege%20of%20Tobruk">siege in Tobruk</a>. Blamey would spend the rest of the year attempting to reassemble his forces. This led to a clash with Auchinleck over the relief of Tobruk, where Blamey accepted Burston's advice that the Australian troops there should be relieved on medical grounds. Menzies, and later his successor, <a href="John%20Curtin">John Curtin</a>, backed Blamey, and Auchinleck and Churchill were forced to give way resulting in the relief of most of the Australian troops by the British <a href="70th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">70th Division</a>. For his campaigns in the Middle East, Blamey was created a <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath</a> on 1 January 1942. He was Mentioned in Despatches for the eighth time, and was awarded the <a href="Greek%20War%20Cross">Greek War Cross</a>, First Class.

The defence of Australia took on a new urgency in December 1941 with the entry of Japan into the war. Within the Army there was a concern that Bennett or Lavarack would be appointed as commander-in-chief. In March 1942, Vasey, Herring and Steele approached the <a href="Minister%20for%20Defence%20%28Australia%29%23Ministers%20for%20the%20Army">Minister for the Army</a>, <a href="Frank%20Forde">Frank Forde</a>, with a proposal that all officers over the age of 50 be immediately retired and Major General <a href="Horace%20Robertson">Horace Robertson</a> be appointed commander-in-chief. This "revolt of the generals" collapsed with the welcome news that Blamey was returning from the Middle East to become commander-in-chief of <a href="Australian%20Military%20Forces">Australian Military Forces</a>.

<a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a> arrived in Australia in March 1942 to become <a href="Supreme%20Allied%20Commander">Supreme Commander</a> <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area%20%28command%29">South West Pacific Area</a> (SWPA). In addition to his duties as commander-in-chief, Blamey became commander of Allied Land Forces, South West Pacific Area. In the reorganisation that followed his return to Australia on 23 March, Blamey appointed Lavarack to command the <a href="First%20Army%20%28Australia%29">First Army</a>, Mackay to command the <a href="Second%20Army%20%28Australia%29">Second Army</a>, and Bennett to command the <a href="III%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">III Corps</a> in Western Australia. Vasey became deputy chief of the general staff (DCGS), while Herring took over Northern Territory Force, and Robertson became commander of the <a href="1st%20Armoured%20Division%20%28Australia%29">1st Armoured Division</a>. Blamey's Allied Land Forces Headquarters (LHQ) was established in Melbourne, but after MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) moved to Brisbane in July 1942, Blamey established an Advanced LHQ in nearby <a href="St%20Lucia%2C%20Queensland">St Lucia, Queensland</a>.

The Allied command structure was soon put under strain by Australian reverses in the <a href="Kokoda%20Track%20campaign">Kokoda Track campaign</a>. MacArthur was highly critical of the Australian performance, and confided to the <a href="Chief%20of%20Staff%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Army">Chief of Staff of the United States Army</a>, General <a href="George%20Marshall">George Marshall</a>, that "the Australians have proven themselves unable to match the enemy in jungle fighting. Aggressive leadership is lacking." MacArthur told Curtin that Blamey should be sent up to New Guinea to take personal command of the situation. Curtin later confessed that "in my ignorance (of military matters) I thought that the Commander in Chief should be in New Guinea." <a href="Jack%20Beasley">Jack Beasley</a> suggested that Blamey would make a convenient scapegoat: "<a href="Port%20Moresby">Moresby</a> is going to fall. Send Blamey up there and let him fall with it!"
Blamey felt he had no choice, but his assumption of command of New Guinea Force sat uneasily with Rowell, the commander of I Corps there, who saw it as displaying a lack of confidence in him. A petulant Rowell would not be mollified, and, after a series of disagreements, Blamey relieved Rowell of his command, replacing him with Herring. More reliefs followed. Herring relieved Brigadier <a href="Arnold%20Potts">Arnold Potts</a> of the <a href="21st%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">21st Infantry Brigade</a>, replacing him with Brigadier <a href="Ivan%20Dougherty">Ivan Dougherty</a> on 22 October. Five days later, Blamey replaced Allen as the 7th Division's commander with Vasey. Nor were generals the only ones to be removed. Blamey cancelled <a href="Chester%20Wilmot">Chester Wilmot</a>'s accreditation as a <a href="war%20correspondent">war correspondent</a> in October 1942 for spreading a false rumour that Blamey was taking payments from the laundry contractor at <a href="Puckapunyal">Puckapunyal</a>. Wilmot was reinstated, but on 1 November 1942, Blamey again terminated Wilmot's accreditation, this time for good.

Blamey made a controversial speech to the 21st Infantry Brigade on 9 November 1942. According to the official historian, <a href="Dudley%20McCarthy">Dudley McCarthy</a>:
The implication of cowardice was seen as contrasting with his own inability to stand up to MacArthur and the Prime Minister. Rowell felt that Blamey "had not shown the necessary 'moral courage' to fight the Cabinet on an issue of confidence in me." When American troops suffered serious reverses in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Buna%E2%80%93Gona">Battle of Buna–Gona</a>, Blamey turned the tables on MacArthur. According to <a href="Lieutenant%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="George%20Kenney">George Kenney</a>, the commander of Allied Air Forces, Blamey "frankly said he would rather send in more Australians, as he knew they would fight ... a bitter pill for MacArthur to swallow". In January 1943, he visited the Buna–Gona battlefield, surprising Vasey at how far forward he went, seemingly unconcerned about his safety. Blamey was impressed by the strength of the Japanese fortifications that had been captured, later telling correspondents that Australian and American troops had performed miracles.

At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Wau">Battle of Wau</a> in January 1943, Blamey won the battle by acting decisively on intelligence, shifting the 17th Infantry Brigade from <a href="Milne%20Bay">Milne Bay</a> in time to defeat the Japanese attack. The official historian, Dudley McCarthy, later wrote:
For the Papuan Campaign, MacArthur awarded Blamey the American <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Distinguished Service Cross</a>, and Blamey was created a <a href="Knight%20Grand%20Cross%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire</a> on 28 May 1943. This was unusual as it was the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Australian Labor Party</a>'s policy not to award knighthoods, but was done as a response to the British government's awards to British and American officers for the <a href="North%20African%20campaign">North African campaign</a>. Blamey's and Herring's knighthoods would be the last that the Labor government would award to Australian soldiers.

The relationship between MacArthur and Blamey was generally good, and they had great respect for each other's abilities. MacArthur's main objection was that as commander-in-chief of AMF as well as commander of Allied Land Forces, Blamey was not wholly under his command. Official historian <a href="Gavin%20Long">Gavin Long</a> argued that:
The next operation was MacArthur's <a href="Operation%20Cartwheel">Operation Cartwheel</a>, an advance on the major Japanese base at Rabaul. The Australian Army was tasked with the capture of the <a href="Huon%20Peninsula">Huon Peninsula</a>. Blamey was ordered to again assume personal command of New Guinea Force. His concept, which he developed with Herring and <a href="Frank%20Berryman">Frank Berryman</a>, who had replaced Vasey as DCGS, was to draw the Japanese forces away from Lae with a demonstration against <a href="Salamaua">Salamaua</a>, and then capture <a href="Lae">Lae</a> with a double envelopment. Blamey remained a devotee of new technology. His plan called for the use of the landing craft of the <a href="2nd%20Engineer%20Special%20Brigade">2nd Engineer Special Brigade</a>, and he intended to cross the <a href="Markham%20River">Markham River</a> with the aid of paratroops. Supplies would be brought across the river using <a href="DUKW">DUKW</a>s, a relatively new invention. He also attempted to acquire helicopters, but met resistance from the RAAF, and they were never delivered. MacArthur accepted a number of changes that Blamey made to his strategy, probably the most notable of which was putting the <a href="New%20Britain%20campaign">landing on New Britain</a> before Blamey's attack on <a href="Madang">Madang</a>.

The campaign started well; Lae was captured well ahead of schedule. Blamey then handed over command of New Guinea Force to Mackay and returned to Australia. The 7th Division then <a href="Finisterre%20Range%20campaign">advanced through the Ramu Valley</a> while the 9th Division <a href="Battle%20of%20Finschhafen">landed at Finschhafen</a>. The campaign then slowed owing to a combination of logistical difficulties and Japanese resistance. Blamey responded to a request from Mackay to relieve Herring, whose chief of staff had been killed in an aircraft accident. He immediately sent Morshead. In February 1944 there was criticism in Parliament of the way that Blamey had "side tracked" various generals; the names of Bennett, Rowell, Mackay, Wynter, Herring, Lavarack, Robertson, Morshead and Clowes were mentioned. Blamey responded, 

Blamey was annoyed by the media campaign run against him by <a href="William%20Dunstan">William Dunstan</a> and <a href="Keith%20Murdoch">Keith Murdoch</a> of "<a href="The%20Herald%20and%20Weekly%20Times">The Herald and Weekly Times</a>" newspaper group, but success in New Guinea led to a change of heart at the newspaper, and Blamey even accepted a dinner invitation from Murdoch in 1944. There was another victory, though, far more significant. The Army had taken heavy casualties from <a href="malaria">malaria</a> in the fighting in 1942. Blamey took the advice of <a href="Edward%20Ford%20%28physician%29">Edward Ford</a> and <a href="Neil%20Hamilton%20Fairley">Neil Hamilton Fairley</a>, and strongly backed their ultimately successful efforts to control the disease. To acquaint himself with the issues, Blamey read through "Manson's Tropical Diseases", the standard medical textbook on the subject. Blamey also promoted the work of <a href="Howard%20Florey">Howard Florey</a> on the development of <a href="penicillin">penicillin</a>, and wrote to Curtin urging that £200,000 be earmarked for Florey's vision of a national institute for medical research in Canberra, which ultimately became the <a href="John%20Curtin%20School%20of%20Medical%20Research">John Curtin School of Medical Research</a>.

Blamey was involved in discussions with the government over the size of the Army to be maintained. Now that the danger of invasion of Australia had passed, the government reconsidered how the nation's resources, particularly of manpower, should be distributed. Blamey pressed for a commitment to maintain three AIF divisions, as only they could legally be sent north of the equator where the final campaigns would be fought. He urged that the <a href="Empire%20Air%20Training%20Scheme">Empire Air Training Scheme</a> be curtailed, and opposed MacArthur's proposal to use the Australian Army primarily for logistic support and leave combat roles principally to American troops.

On 5 April 1944, Blamey departed for San Francisco on board <a href="SS%20Lurline%20%281932%29">SS "Lurline"</a> for the first leg of a voyage to attend the 1944 <a href="Commonwealth%20Prime%20Ministers%27%20Conference">Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference</a> in London as part of Curtin's party. The journey was made by sea and rail due to Curtin's fear of flying. Also on board the ship were American military personnel returning to the United States, and some 40 Australian war brides. Blamey "was always attractive to women and attracted by them. Advancing years had not reduced either his taste for amorous adventures or his capacity to enjoy them", and he brought with him several cases of spirits. The rowdy goings-on in Blamey's cabin did not endear him to the Prime Minister, who was a reformed alcoholic. The party travelled by train to Washington, DC, where Blamey was warmly greeted by the <a href="Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a>, and briefed the <a href="Combined%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Combined Chiefs of Staff</a> on the progress of the war in SWPA. In London Blamey had a series of meetings with the <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Imperial%20General%20Staff">Chief of the Imperial General Staff</a>, Field Marshal Sir <a href="Alan%20Brooke">Alan Brooke</a>, and was briefed on <a href="Operation%20Overlord">Operation Overlord</a> by General Sir <a href="Bernard%20Montgomery">Bernard Montgomery</a> and <a href="Air%20Chief%20Marshal">Air Chief Marshal</a> Sir <a href="Arthur%20Tedder">Arthur Tedder</a>. Blamey was disappointed to have to turn down an offer to accompany the invasion as a guest of General <a href="Dwight%20Eisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a> because Curtin feared that the invasion would lead to retaliatory German bombing, and wanted to be far away before it started.

As a matter of policy, Curtin wanted Australian forces to be involved in liberating New Guinea. MacArthur therefore proposed that Australian troops relieve the American garrisons on <a href="New%20Britain%20Campaign">New Britain</a>, <a href="Bougainville%20Campaign">Bougainville</a> and <a href="Aitape-Wewak%20campaign">New Guinea</a>. However, MacArthur balked at Blamey's proposal to replace the seven American divisions with just seven Australian brigades, resulting in the 6th Division being employed as well. The larger garrisons permitted offensive operations, and demanded them if the 6th Division was to be freed for employment elsewhere. These operations aroused considerable criticism on the grounds that they were unnecessary, that the troops should have been employed elsewhere, and that the Army's equipment and logistics were inadequate. Blamey vigorously defended his aggressive policy to reduce the bypassed Japanese garrisons and free the civilian population, but some felt that he went too far in putting his case publicly in a national radio broadcast. He was also criticised for not spending enough time in forward areas, although he spent more than half his time outside Australia in 1944, and between April 1944 and April 1945 travelled by air, by sea and by land. Blamey urged that the 7th Division not be sent to <a href="Battle%20of%20Balikpapan%20%281945%29">Balikpapan</a>, an operation that he regarded as unnecessary. On this occasion, he was not supported by the government, and the operation went ahead as planned.

Gavin Long wrote: 

On 2 September 1945, Blamey was with MacArthur on and signed the Japanese surrender document on behalf of Australia. He then flew to <a href="Morotai">Morotai</a> and personally accepted the surrender of the remaining Japanese in the South West Pacific. He insisted that Australia should be represented in the <a href="Allied%20occupation%20of%20Japan">Allied occupation of Japan</a>.

MacArthur abolished SWPA on 2 September 1945, and on 15 September Blamey offered to resign. The war was over, and the post of commander-in-chief was now a purely administrative one. His offer was not accepted, but on 14 November, the government abruptly announced that it had accepted his resignation, effective 30 November. A farewell party was held in Melbourne, which was attended by 66 brigadiers and generals. Blamey was given time to write up his despatches, and was formally retired on 31 January 1946. Forde asked Blamey if he wanted anything in way of recognition for his services, and Blamey asked for knighthoods for his generals, but Forde could not arrange this. In the end, Forde decided to give Blamey the Buick staff car he had used during the war, which had clocked up in the Middle East and the South West Pacific.

Blamey returned to Melbourne, where he devoted himself to business affairs, to writing, and to promoting the welfare of ex-service personnel. In September 1948, Blamey paid a visit to Japan, where he was warmly greeted on arrival at <a href="Iwakuni">Iwakuni</a> by Horace Robertson, the commander of the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Occupation%20Force">British Commonwealth Occupation Force</a>, who also provided an RAAF honour guard. MacArthur sent his own aircraft, the "Bataan", to collect Blamey and bring him to Tokyo, where he met Blamey at the airport and gave him another warm greeting. In the late 1940s Blamey became involved with The Association, an organisation similar to the earlier League of National Security, which was established to counter a possible communist coup. He was the head of the organisation until ill health forced him to stand down in favour of Morshead in 1950.

Menzies became prime minister again in December 1949, and he resolved that Blamey should be promoted to the rank of field marshal, something that had been mooted in 1945. The recommendation went via the <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Australia">Governor-General</a>, <a href="William%20McKell">William McKell</a>, to the War Office in London, which replied that a <a href="dominion">dominion</a> officer could not be promoted to the rank. Menzies pointed out that <a href="Jan%20Smuts">Jan Smuts</a> already had. The War Office then claimed that Blamey could not be promoted to field marshal because he was a retired officer, which was not true. Menzies then restored Blamey to active duty. Blamey was duly promoted to field marshal in the King's Birthday Honours of 8 June 1950.

A few days afterwards, Blamey became seriously ill and received his field marshal's baton from McKell in a bedside ceremony at the <a href="Heidelberg%20Repatriation%20Hospital">Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital</a>. Blamey died there of hypertensive <a href="cerebral%20haemorrhage">cerebral haemorrhage</a> on 27 May 1951. His body lay in state at the <a href="Shrine%20of%20Remembrance">Shrine of Remembrance</a>, where 20,000 people filed past. Crowds estimated at 300,000 lined the streets of Melbourne at his state funeral. Ten of his lieutenant generals served as pallbearers: Frank Berryman, William Bridgeford, Edmund Herring, Iven Mackay, Leslie Morshead, <a href="John%20Northcott">John Northcott</a>, Sydney Rowell, Stanley Savige, <a href="Vernon%20Sturdee">Vernon Sturdee</a> and <a href="Henry%20Wells%20%28general%29">Henry Wells</a>. His body was cremated at the <a href="Fawkner%20Crematorium%20and%20Memorial%20Park">Fawkner Crematorium and Memorial Park</a>.

Blamey is honoured in Australia in various ways, including a square named after him which is situated outside the <a href="Russell%20Offices">Russell Offices</a> headquarters of the <a href="Australian%20Defence%20Force">Australian Defence Force</a> and <a href="Department%20of%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Department of Defence</a> in the national capital, <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>. Blamey Crescent and Blamey Place in the Canberra suburb of <a href="Campbell%2C_Australian_Capital_Territory">Campbell</a> are also named in his honour. A statue of Blamey stands in <a href="Kings%20Domain%2C%20Melbourne">Kings Domain, Melbourne</a>, on the corner of Government House Drive and Birdwood Avenue, opposite that of John Monash. It was sculptured from granite and bronze by <a href="Raymond%20B.%20Ewers">Raymond B. Ewers</a> and presented to the city in February 1960. Controversially, Blamey is mounted on a jeep instead of the traditional horse. <a href="Blamey%20Barracks">Blamey Barracks</a> at <a href="Kapooka">Kapooka</a>, where the <a href="Army%20Recruit%20Training%20Centre">Army Recruit Training Centre</a> is located, is also named in his honour, as are Blamey Street and Blamey Park in <a href="North%20Ryde%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">North Ryde, New South Wales</a>. His papers are held in the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a>, where his field marshal's baton is on display.

Richard Williams (RAAF officer)

<a href="Air%20Marshal">Air Marshal</a> Sir Richard Williams, (3 August 18907 February 1980) is widely regarded as the "father" of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF). He was the first military pilot trained in Australia, and went on to command Australian and British <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighter</a> units in World War I. A proponent for air power independent of other branches of the armed services, Williams played a leading role in the establishment of the RAAF and became its first <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a> (CAS) in 1922. He served as CAS for thirteen years over three terms, longer than any other officer.

Williams came from a working-class background in South Australia. He was a <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> in the <a href="Australian%20Army">Army</a> when he learned to fly at <a href="Point%20Cook%2C%20Victoria">Point Cook</a>, Victoria, in 1914. As a pilot with the <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a> (AFC) in World War I, Williams rose to command <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1 Squadron AFC</a>, and later <a href="No.%2040%20Wing%20RAF">40th Wing RAF</a>. He was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> and finished the war a <a href="lieutenant%20colonel">lieutenant colonel</a>. Afterwards he campaigned for an Australian Air Force run separately to the Army and <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Navy</a>, which came into being on 31 March 1921.

The fledgling RAAF faced several challenges to its continued existence in the 1920s and early 1930s, and Williams received much of the credit for maintaining its independence. However an adverse report on flying safety standards saw him dismissed from the position of CAS and seconded to the RAF prior to World War II. Despite support in various quarters for his reinstatement as Air Force chief, and promotion to air marshal in 1940, he never again commanded the RAAF. After the war he was forcibly retired along with other World War I veteran officers. He took up the position of <a href="Airservices%20Australia%23History">Director-General of Civil Aviation</a> in Australia, and was <a href="knight">knight</a>ed the year before his retirement in 1955.

Williams was born on 3 August 1890 into a working-class family in <a href="Moonta%2C%20South%20Australia">Moonta Mines</a>, South Australia. He was the eldest son of Richard Williams, a <a href="Copper%20extraction%20techniques">copper miner</a> who had emigrated from <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, England, and his wife Emily. Leaving Moonta Public School at junior secondary level, Williams worked as a <a href="telegraph">telegraph</a> messenger and later as a bank <a href="clerk%20%28position%29">clerk</a>. He enlisted in a <a href="militia">militia</a> unit, the South Australian Infantry Regiment, in 1909 at the age of nineteen. Commissioned a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> on 8 March 1911, he joined the Permanent Military Forces the following year.

In August 1914, Lieutenant Williams took part in Australia's inaugural military flying course at <a href="Central%20Flying%20School%20RAAF">Central Flying School</a>, run by Lieutenants <a href="Henry%20Petre">Henry Petre</a> and <a href="Eric%20Harrison%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Eric Harrison</a>. After soloing in a <a href="Bristol%20Boxkite">Bristol Boxkite</a> around the airfield at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Point%20Cook%20Base">Point Cook</a>, Victoria, Williams became the first student to graduate as a pilot, on 12 November 1914. He recalled the school as a "ragtime show" consisting of a paddock, tents, and one large structure: a shed for the Boxkite. Following an administrative and instructional posting, Williams underwent advanced flying training at Point Cook in July 1915. The next month he married Constance Esther Griffiths, who was thirteen years his senior. The couple had no children.

Williams was promoted <a href="Captain%20%28land%20and%20air%29">captain</a> on 5 January 1916. He was appointed a flight commander in <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1 Squadron Australian Flying Corps (AFC)</a>, which was initially numbered 67 Squadron <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> by the British. The unit departed Australia in March 1916 without any aircraft; after arriving in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> it received <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20B.E.2">B.E.2</a> fighters, a type deficient in speed and manoeuvrability, and which lacked forward-firing machine guns. Williams wrote that in combat with the German <a href="Fokker">Fokker</a>s, "our fighting in the air was of short duration but could mean a quick end", and that when it came to bombing, he and his fellow pilots "depended mainly on luck". He further quoted a truism in the Flying Corps that "if a new pilot got through his first three days without being shot down he was lucky; if he got through three weeks he was doing well and if he got through three months he was set". Williams and the other Australians were initially involved in isolated tasks around the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a>, attached to various Royal Flying Corps (RFC) units. No. 1 Squadron began to operate concertedly in December 1916, supporting the Allied advance on <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a>. Williams completed his RFC attachment in February 1917.

On 5 March 1917, shortly after commencing operations with No. 1 Squadron, Williams narrowly avoided crash-landing when his engine stopped while he was bombing the <a href="Railhead">railway terminus</a> at Tel el Sheria. At first believing that he had been struck by enemy fire, he found that the engine switch outside his cockpit had turned off. Within 500 feet of the ground he was able to switch the engine back on and return to base. On 21 April, Williams landed behind enemy lines to rescue downed comrade Lieutenant <a href="Adrian%20Cole%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Adrian Cole</a>, having the day before pressed home an attack on Turkish cavalry whilst under "intense anti-aircraft fire"; these two actions earned him the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> for "conspicuous gallantry". He was promoted <a href="major">major</a> in May and given command of No. 1 Squadron, which was re-equipped with <a href="Bristol%20F.2%20Fighter">Bristol Fighters</a> later that year. "Now for the first time," wrote Williams, "after 17 months in the field we had aircraft with which we could deal with our enemy in the air." His men knew him as a teetotaller and non-smoker, whose idea of swearing was an occasional "Darn me!".
In June 1918, Williams was made a <a href="Brevet%20%28military%29">brevet</a> <a href="lieutenant%20colonel">lieutenant colonel</a> and commander of the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">RAF</a>'s <a href="No.%2040%20Wing%20RAF">40th (Army) Wing</a>, which was operating in Palestine. It comprised his former No. 1 Squadron and three British units. As a <a href="British%20Dominions">Dominion</a> officer, Williams found that he was not permitted to "exercise powers of punishment over British personnel", leading to him being temporarily "granted a supplementary commission in the Royal Air Force". Augmented by a giant <a href="Handley%20Page%20Type%20O">Handley Page bomber</a>, his forces took part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Megiddo%20%281918%29">Battle of Armageddon</a>, the final offensive in Palestine, where they inflicted "wholesale destruction" on Turkish columns. Of 40th Wing's actions at <a href="Wadi%20al-Far%27a">Wadi Fara</a> on 21 September 1918, Williams wrote: "The Turkish Seventh Army ceased to exist and it must be noted that this was entirely the result of attack from the air." He also sent Captain <a href="Ross%20Macpherson%20Smith">Ross Smith</a> in the Handley Page, accompanied by two Bristol Fighters, to aid Major <a href="T.%20E.%20Lawrence">T. E. Lawrence</a>'s Arab army north of <a href="Amman">Amman</a> when it was harassed by German aircraft operating from <a href="Daraa">Deraa</a>. In November, Williams was appointed temporary commander of the <a href="RAF%20Palestine%20Brigade">Palestine Brigade</a>, which comprised his previous command, the 40th (Army) Wing, and <a href="No.%205%20Wing%20RAF">5th (Corps) Wing</a>. His service in the theatre later saw him awarded the Order of the Nahda by the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hejaz">King of the Hejaz</a>. Twice <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a>, by the end of the war Williams had established himself, in the words of RAAF historian Alan Stephens, as "the AFC's rising star".

Appointed an <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> in the <a href="1919%20New%20Year%20Honours">1919 New Year Honours</a>, Williams served as Staff Officer, Aviation, at <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF) headquarters in London, before returning to Australia and taking up the position of Director of Air Services at Army Headquarters, <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. The <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a> had meanwhile been disbanded and replaced by the <a href="Australian%20Air%20Corps">Australian Air Corps</a> (AAC) which was, like the AFC, a branch of the <a href="Australian%20Army">Army</a>.

Upon establishment of the <a href="Air%20Board%20%28Australia%29">Australian Air Board</a> on 9 November 1920, Williams and his fellow AAC officers dropped their army ranks in favour of <a href="RAF%20officer%20ranks">those based on the Royal Air Force</a>. Williams, now a <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a>, personally compiled and tabled the Air Board's submissions to create the Australian Air Force (AAF), a service independent of both the Army and the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a>. Though the heads of the Army and Navy opposed the creation of an independent air arm for fear that they would be unable to find air cover for their operations, support from Prime Minister <a href="Billy%20Hughes">Billy Hughes</a>, as well as prominent parliamentary figures including Treasurer <a href="Joseph%20Cook">Joseph Cook</a> and Defence Minister <a href="George%20Pearce">George Pearce</a> allowed the proposal to succeed. The AAF was duly formed on 31 March 1921; Williams deliberately chose this day rather than 1 April, the founding date of the RAF three years earlier, "to prevent nasty people referring to us as 'April Fools'". The "Royal" prefix was added five months later. Williams proposed an <a href="ensign">ensign</a> for the AAF in July 1921, based on the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force%20Ensign">Royal Air Force flag</a> but featuring the five stars of the <a href="Southern%20Cross">Southern Cross</a> within the RAF <a href="roundel">roundel</a> and the <a href="Commonwealth%20Star">Commonwealth Star</a> in the lower hoist quarter. This design was not adopted for the RAAF, the government employing instead a direct copy of the RAF ensign until 1949, when a new design using the stars of the <a href="Australian%20Flag">Australian Flag</a> was chosen.

As the senior officer of the Air Board, Williams held the title of First Air Member, the nascent Air Force initially not being deemed suitable for a "Chief of Staff" appointment equivalent to the Army and Navy. He moved to consolidate the new service's position by expanding its assets and training. Shortly after the AAF's establishment, land was purchased for an air base at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Laverton%20Base">Laverton</a>, eight kilometres (five miles) inland of Point Cook, and in July 1921 Williams made the initial proposal to develop a base at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">Richmond</a>, New South Wales, the first outside Victoria. He also started a program to second students from the Army and Navy, including graduates of the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a>, to bolster officer numbers; candidates reaped by this scheme included future Air Force chiefs <a href="John%20McCauley">John McCauley</a>, <a href="Frederick%20Scherger">Frederick Scherger</a>, <a href="Valston%20Hancock">Valston Hancock</a> and <a href="Alister%20Murdoch">Alister Murdoch</a>, along with other senior identities such as <a href="Joe%20Hewitt%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Joe Hewitt</a> and <a href="Frank%20Bladin">Frank Bladin</a>. As a leader, Williams would gain a reputation for strong will, absorption in administrative minutiae and a "somewhat puritanical" nature. He became known throughout the service as "Dicky".

The position of First Air Member was replaced by <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a> (CAS) in October 1922. Williams would serve as CAS three times over seventeen years in the 1920s and '30s, alternating with Wing Commander (later Air Vice Marshal) <a href="Stanley%20Goble">Stanley Goble</a>. One motive suggested for the rotation was a ploy by Army and Navy interests to "curb Williams' independence". Instead the arrangement "almost inevitably fostered an unproductive rivalry" between the two officers. Although in a legal sense the Air Board was responsible for the RAAF rather than the Chief of Staff alone, Williams dominated the board to such an extent that Goble would later complain that his colleague appeared to consider the Air Force his personal command.

Williams spent much of 1923 in England, attending the <a href="Staff%20College%2C%20Camberley">British Army Staff College in Camberley</a> and <a href="RAF%20Staff%20College%2C%20Andover">RAF Staff College, Andover</a>, followed by further study in Canada and the United States the following year. Goble served as Chief of the Air Staff in his absence. Shortly after his return in February 1925, Williams scuppered a plan by Goble to establish a small <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a> base at <a href="Rushcutters%20Bay">Rushcutters Bay</a> in Sydney, instead organising purchase of <a href="Supermarine%20Seagull%20%281921%29">Supermarine Seagulls</a>, the RAAF's first <a href="amphibious%20aircraft">amphibious aircraft</a>, to be based at Richmond. He was promoted to <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a> in July and later that year drafted a major air warfare study, ""Memorandum Regarding the Air Defence of Australia"". Considered prescient in many ways, it treated World War I ally <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japan</a> as Australia's main military threat, and advocated inter-service co-operation while maintaining that none of the armed forces was "purely auxiliary to another". Its concepts continue to influence RAAF strategy.

In 1926, Williams mandated the use of <a href="parachute">parachute</a>s for all RAAF aircrew. He had visited the <a href="Leslie%20Irvin%20%28parachutist%29">Irvin Air Chute Company</a> while in the US during 1924 and recommended purchase at the time, but a backlog of orders for the RAF meant that the Australian equipment took almost two years to arrive. <a href="Flying%20Officer">Flying Officer</a> <a href="Ellis%20Wackett">Ellis Wackett</a> was assigned to instruct volunteers at RAAF Richmond, and made the country's first freefall descent from a military aircraft, an <a href="Airco%20DH.9">Airco DH.9</a>, on 26 May. Williams himself jumped over Point Cook on 5 August, having decided that it would set "a good example if, before issuing an order for the compulsory wearing of parachutes, I showed my own confidence in them ..." Though his descent took him perilously close to the base water tank ("I thought it would be a poor ending to drown there, or even to be pulled out dripping wet") and "too close to be comfortable to a 30,000 volt electric transmission line", he completed the exercise unscathed.
The young Air Force was a small organisation with the atmosphere of a <a href="flying%20club">flying club</a>, although several pioneering flights were made by its members. Goble had commanded the first <a href="circumnavigation">circumnavigation</a> of Australia by air in 1924 while he was CAS. On 25 September 1926, with two crew members including Goble's pilot, <a href="Ivor%20McIntyre">Ivor McIntyre</a>, Williams commenced a round trip from Point Cook to the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a> in a <a href="De%20Havilland%20DH.50">De Havilland DH.50</a>A <a href="floatplane">floatplane</a>, to study the South Pacific region as a possible theatre of operations. The trio returned on 7 December to a 12-plane RAAF escort and a 300-man honour guard. Though seen partly as a "matter of prestige" brought on by contemporary newspaper reports that claimed "'certain Foreign Powers'" were planning such a journey, and also as a "reaction" by Williams to Goble's 1924 expedition, it was notable as the first international flight undertaken by an RAAF plane and crew. Williams was appointed a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (CBE) in the 1927 <a href="Queen%27s%20Birthday%20Honours">King's Birthday Honours</a> in recognition of the achievement, and promoted to <a href="air%20commodore">air commodore</a> on 1 July the same year.

As CAS, Williams had to contend with serious challenges to the RAAF's continued existence from the Army and Navy in 1929 and 1932, arising from the competing demands for defence funding during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>. According to Williams, only after 1932 was the independence of the Air Force assured. Williams again handed over the reins of CAS to Goble in 1933 to attend the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Defence%20Studies">Imperial Defence College</a> in London, resuming his position in June 1934. His promotion to <a href="air%20vice%20marshal">air vice marshal</a> on 1 January 1935 belatedly raised him to the equivalent rank of his fellow Chiefs of Staff in the Army and Navy. He was appointed a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> in June that year.

Williams encouraged the local aircraft industry as a means to further the self-sufficiency of the Air Force and Australian aviation in general. He played a personal part in the creation of the <a href="Commonwealth%20Aircraft%20Corporation">Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation</a> in November 1936, headed up by former <a href="Squadron%20Leader">Squadron Leader</a> <a href="Lawrence%20Wackett">Lawrence Wackett</a>, late of the RAAF's Experimental Section. Williams made the first overseas flight in an aeroplane designed and built in Australia when he accompanied Squadron Leader <a href="Allan%20Walters">Allan Walters</a> and two aircrew aboard a <a href="Tugan%20Gannet">Tugan Gannet</a> to Singapore in February 1938.

A series of mishaps with <a href="Hawker%20Demon">Hawker Demon</a>s at the end of 1937, which resulted in one pilot dying and four injured, subjected the Air Force to harsh public criticism. In 1939 Williams was dismissed from his post as CAS and "effectively banished overseas", following publication of the Ellington Report that January. Its author, Marshal of the Royal Air Force <a href="Edward%20Leonard%20Ellington">Sir Edward Leonard Ellington</a>, criticised the level of air safety observed in the RAAF, though his interpretation of statistics has been called into question. The Federal government praised Williams for strengthening the Air Force but blamed him for Ellington's findings, and he was criticised in the press. Beyond the adverse report, Williams was thought to have "made enemies" through his strident championing of the RAAF's independence. A later CAS, <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">George Jones</a>, contended that Ellington had been "invited to Australia in order to inspect Williams rather than the air force and to recommend his removal from the post of Chief of the Air Staff if necessary". The government announced that it was seconding him to the RAF for two years.

When war broke out in September 1939, Williams was <a href="Air%20Officer">Air Officer</a> in charge of Administration at RAF <a href="Coastal%20Command">Coastal Command</a>, a position he had held since February that year, following a brief posting to the British <a href="Air%20Ministry">Air Ministry</a>. Goble had succeeded Williams as Chief of the Air Staff for the last time but clashed with the Federal government over implementation of the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Air%20Training%20Plan">Empire Air Training Scheme</a> and stepped down in early 1940. Williams was recalled from Britain with the expectation of again taking up the RAAF's senior position but Prime Minister <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a> insisted on a British officer commanding the service, over the protest of his Minister for Air, <a href="James%20Fairbairn">James Fairbairn</a>, and the RAF's Air Chief Marshal <a href="Charles%20Burnett%20%28RAF%20officer%29">Sir Charles Burnett</a> became CAS. In his volume in the <a href="Australia%20in%20the%20War%20of%201939%E2%80%931945">official history of the Air Force in World War II</a>, Douglas Gillison observed that considering Williams' intimate knowledge of the RAAF and its problems, and his long experience commanding the service, "it is difficult to see what contribution Burnett was expected to make that was beyond Williams' capacity". Williams was appointed Air Member for Organisation and Equipment and promoted to <a href="air%20marshal">air marshal</a>, the first man in the RAAF to achieve this rank.

Williams returned to England in October 1941 to set up <a href="RAAF%20Overseas%20Headquarters">RAAF Overseas Headquarters</a>, co-ordinating services for the many Australians posted there. He maintained that Australian airmen in Europe and the Mediterranean should serve in RAAF units to preserve their national identity, as per <a href="Article%20XV%20squadrons">Article XV</a> of the Empire Air Training Scheme, rather than be integrated into RAF squadrons, but in practice most served in British units. Even nominally "RAAF" squadrons formed under the Scheme were rarely composed primarily of Australians, and Williams' efforts to establish a distinct RAAF Group within <a href="RAF%20Bomber%20Command">Bomber Command</a>, similar to the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Air%20Force">Royal Canadian Air Force</a>'s <a href="No.%206%20Group%20RCAF">No. 6 Group</a>, did not come to fruition. He was able to negotiate improved conditions for RAAF personnel in Europe, including full Australian pay scales as opposed to the lower RAF rates that were offered initially.

When Air Chief Marshal Burnett completed his term in 1942, Williams was once more considered for the role of CAS. This was vetoed by Prime Minister <a href="John%20Curtin">John Curtin</a> and the appointment unexpectedly went to acting Air Commodore George Jones. A mooted <a href="Inspector%20General">Inspector General</a>ship of the Air Force, which would have seen Williams reporting directly to the Minister for Air, also failed to materialise. Instead Williams was posted to Washington, D.C. as the RAAF's representative to the <a href="Combined%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Combined Chiefs of Staff</a> in the United States, and remained there until the end of the war.

In 1946, Williams was forced into retirement despite being four years below the mandatory age of 60. All other senior RAAF commanders who were veteran pilots of World War I, with the exception of the-then Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Jones, were also dismissed, ostensibly to make way for the advancement of younger officers. Williams regarded the grounds for his removal as "specious", calling it "the meanest piece of service administration in my experience".

Following his completion of duty in the Air Force, Williams was appointed Australia's <a href="Airservices%20Australia%23History">Director-General of Civil Aviation</a>, serving in the position for almost 10 years. His department was responsible for the expansion of communications and infrastructure to support domestic and international aviation, establishing "an enviable safety record". Williams' tenure coincided with the beginnings of the government carrier <a href="Trans%20Australia%20Airlines">Trans Australia Airlines</a> (TAA) and introduction of the <a href="Two%20Airlines%20Policy">Two Airlines Policy</a>, as well as the construction of <a href="Adelaide%20Airport">Adelaide Airport</a> and redevelopment of <a href="Sydney%20Airport">Sydney Airport</a> as an international facility.

William's wife Constance died in 1948 and he married Lois Victoria Cross on 7 February 1950. He was appointed <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (KBE) in the 1954 New Year Honours, the year before he retired from the Director-Generalship of Civil Aviation. He then took up a place on the board of <a href="TEAL">Tasman Empire Airways Limited</a> (TEAL), forerunner of <a href="Air%20New%20Zealand">Air New Zealand</a>. In 1977, Williams published his memoirs, "These Are Facts", described in 2001 as "immensely important if idiosyncratic ... the only substantial, worthwhile record of service ever written by an RAAF chief of staff".

Sir Richard Williams died in Melbourne on 7 February 1980. He was accorded an Air Force funeral, with a <a href="flypast">flypast</a> by seventeen aircraft.

For his stewardship of the Air Force prior to World War II, as well as his part in its establishment in 1921, Williams is considered the "father" of the RAAF. The epithet had earlier been applied to Eric Harrison, who had sole charge of Central Flying School after Henry Petre was posted to the Middle East in 1915, and was also a founding member of the RAAF. By the 1970s, the mantle had settled on Williams. Between the wars he had continually striven for his service's status as a separate branch of the Australian armed forces, seeing off several challenges to its independence from Army and Navy interests. He remains the RAAF's longest-serving Chief, totalling thirteen years over three terms: October to December 1922; February 1925 to December 1932; and June 1934 to February 1939.

In his 1925 paper ""Memorandum Regarding the Air Defence of Australia"", Williams defined "the fundamental nature of Australia's defence challenge" and "the enduring characteristics of the RAAF's strategic thinking". Ignored by the government of the day, the study's operational precepts became the basis for Australia's defence strategy in the 1980s, which remains in place in the 21st century. However his input to debate in the 1930s around the "<a href="Singapore%20strategy">Singapore strategy</a>" of dependence on the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> for the defence of the Pacific region has been criticised as limited, and as having "failed to demonstrate the validity of his claims for the central role of air power".

Williams' legacy extends to the very look of the RAAF. He personally chose the colour of the Air Force's winter uniform, a shade "somewhere between royal and navy blue", designed to distinguish it from the lighter Royal Air Force shade. Unique at the time among <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> forces, the uniform was changed to an all-purpose middle blue suit in 1972 but following numerous complaints in the ensuing years reverted to Williams' original colour and style in 2000.

Memorials to Williams include Sir Richard Williams Avenue at Adelaide Airport, and <a href="RAAF%20Williams">RAAF Williams</a> in Victoria, established in 1989 after the merger of <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Point%20Cook%20Base">Point Cook</a> and <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Laverton%20Base">Laverton</a> bases. The Sir Richard Williams Trophy, inaugurated in 1974, is presented to the RAAF's "Fighter Pilot of the Year". In 2005, Williams' Australian Flying Corps <a href="Aircrew%20brevet">wings</a>, usually on display at the <a href="RAAF%20Museum">RAAF Museum</a> in Point Cook, were carried into space and back on a <a href="Space%20Shuttle">shuttle flight</a> by Australian-born astronaut <a href="Andy%20Thomas">Dr Andy Thomas</a>. The Williams Foundation, named in his honour, was launched in February 2009 "to broaden public debate on issues relating to Australian defence and security".

Scottish Parliament Building

The Scottish Parliament Building (, ) is the home of the <a href="Scottish%20Parliament">Scottish Parliament</a> at <a href="Holyrood%2C%20Edinburgh">Holyrood</a>, within the <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a> in central <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>. <a href="Construction">Construction</a> of the building commenced in June 1999 and the <a href="Members%20of%20the%20Scottish%20Parliament">Members of the Scottish Parliament</a> (MSPs) held their first debate in the new building on 7 September 2004. The formal opening by <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> took place on 9 October 2004. <a href="Enric%20Miralles">Enric Miralles</a>, the <a href="Catalan%20people">Catalan</a> architect who designed the building, died before its completion.

From 1999 until the opening of the new building in 2004, committee rooms and the <a href="debating%20chamber">debating chamber</a> of the Scottish Parliament were housed in the <a href="General%20Assembly%20Hall%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20Scotland">General Assembly Hall</a> of the <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">Church of Scotland</a> located on <a href="The%20Mound">The Mound</a> in Edinburgh. Office and administrative accommodation in support of the Parliament were provided in buildings leased from the <a href="City%20of%20Edinburgh%20Council">City of Edinburgh Council</a>. The new Scottish Parliament Building brought together these different elements into one purpose-built parliamentary complex, housing 129 MSPs and more than 1,000 staff and <a href="civil%20servants">civil servants</a>.

From the outset, the building and its construction have been controversial. The choices of location, architect, design, and construction company were all criticised by <a href="Politics%20of%20Scotland">politicians</a>, the <a href="Scottish%20media">media</a> and the Scottish public. Scheduled to open in 2001, it did so in 2004, more than three years late with an estimated final cost of £414 million, many times higher than initial estimates of between £10m and £40m. A major <a href="public%20inquiry">public inquiry</a> into the handling of the construction, chaired by the former <a href="Lord%20Advocate">Lord Advocate</a>, <a href="Peter%20Fraser%2C%20Baron%20Fraser%20of%20Carmyllie">Lord Fraser of Carmyllie</a>, was established in 2003. The inquiry concluded in September 2004 and criticised the management of the whole project from the realisation of cost increases down to the way in which major design changes were implemented. Despite these criticisms and a mixed public reaction, the building was welcomed by architectural academics and critics. The building aimed to achieve a poetic union between the <a href="Geography%20of%20Scotland">Scottish landscape</a>, its <a href="Scottish%20people">people</a>, its <a href="Scottish%20culture">culture</a>, and the city of Edinburgh. The Parliament Building won numerous awards including the 2005 <a href="Stirling%20Prize">Stirling Prize</a> and has been described by landscape architect <a href="Charles%20Jencks">Charles Jencks</a> as "a tour de force of arts and crafts and quality without parallel in the last 100 years of <a href="British%20architecture">British architecture</a>".

Comprising an area of 1.6 <a href="hectare">ha</a> (4 acres), with a perimeter of 480 m (1570 ft), the Scottish Parliament Building is located 1 km (0.6 mi) east of Edinburgh city centre on the edge of the <a href="Old%20Town%2C%20Edinburgh">Old Town</a>. The large site previously housed the headquarters of the <a href="Scottish%20and%20Newcastle">Scottish and Newcastle</a> brewery which were demolished to make way for the building. The boundary of the site is marked by the <a href="Canongate">Canongate</a> stretch of the <a href="Royal%20Mile">Royal Mile</a> on its northern side, Horse Wynd on its eastern side, where the public entrance to the building is, and Reid's Close on its western side. Reid's Close connects the Canongate and Holyrood Road on the southwestern side of the complex. The south eastern side of the complex is bounded by the <a href="Our%20Dynamic%20Earth">Our Dynamic Earth</a> visitor attraction which opened in July 1999, and Queen's Drive which fringes the slopes of <a href="Salisbury%20Crags">Salisbury Crags</a>.

In the immediate vicinity of the building is the <a href="Palace%20of%20Holyroodhouse">Palace of Holyroodhouse</a>, which is bordered by the broad expanse of <a href="Holyrood%20Park">Holyrood Park</a>. To the south of the parliamentary complex are the steep slopes of Salisbury Crags and <a href="Arthur%27s%20Seat">Arthur's Seat</a>. The Holyrood and Dumbiedykes areas, to the west of the site, have been extensively redeveloped since 1998, with new retail, hotel and office developments, including Barclay House, the new offices of <a href="The%20Scotsman%20Publications%20Ltd">The Scotsman Publications Ltd</a>.

Before 1707, the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Kingdom of Scotland</a> was a <a href="Sovereignty">sovereign independent state</a> which had its own legislature—the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Scotland">Parliament of Scotland</a>—which met, latterly, at <a href="Parliament%20House%2C%20Edinburgh">Parliament House</a> on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. The <a href="Treaty%20of%20Union%201707">Treaty of Union</a>, signed in 1707, created an incorporating <a href="political%20union">political union</a> between the Kingdom of Scotland and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">Kingdom of England</a>. This created the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Kingdom of Great Britain</a>. The two previous Acts of Union (one for the Parliament of England and one for the Parliament of Scotland) had dissolved the previous parliaments. The Treaty of Union created the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Great%20Britain">Parliament of Great Britain</a> which was housed in the <a href="Palace%20of%20Westminster">Palace of Westminster</a> in <a href="London">London</a>. As a consequence, Scotland was directly governed from London for the next 292 years without a legislature or a Parliament building of its own.

Pressure for a <a href="Devolution">devolved legislature</a> of some sort grew in the 1970s with the growth of the <a href="Scottish%20National%20Party">Scottish National Party</a> (SNP), and monies were invested into the conversion of the former <a href="Old%20Royal%20High%20School">Royal High School</a> on <a href="Calton%20Hill">Calton Hill</a> into an official parliament building. Whilst much of this conversion was completed (including creation of the main debating hall) and the building was renamed <a href="New%20Parliament%20House%2C%20Edinburgh">New Parliament House</a> it was determined that the facility was too small for its stated purpose (as and when that purpose arose). Following the April 1992 election, when a weakened John Major was re-elected, a campaign group set up adjacent to the Royal High School at the foot of the access road to Calton Hill. Starting informally this became a permanently manned "vigil" to keep the concept in the public mind. This led to the Royal High School being the "popular" choice of site in the public (and particularly SNP) mindset.

A <a href="Scotland%20referendum%2C%201997">referendum</a> of the Scottish electorate, held on 11 September 1997, approved the establishment of a directly elected Scottish Parliament to legislate on most domestic affairs. Following this, the <a href="Scottish%20Office">Scottish Office</a>, led by the then <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Scotland">Secretary of State for Scotland</a>, <a href="Donald%20Dewar">Donald Dewar</a>, decided that a new purpose-built facility would be constructed in Edinburgh, to house the Scottish Parliament.
Initially, three sites in and around Edinburgh were considered as possible locations for the building, including <a href="St%20Andrew%27s%20House">St Andrew's House</a>/New Parliament House (better known as the imposing former Royal High School on Calton Hill) St Andrews House being the home of the Scottish Office—later the <a href="Scottish%20Government">Scottish Government</a>; <a href="Victoria%20Quay%2C%20Scotland">Victoria Quay</a> at <a href="Leith">Leith</a> docks (adjacent to the major Scottish Office building there) and <a href="Haymarket%2C%20Edinburgh">Haymarket</a> on the vacant railway goods yard, in the west end of the city. The Holyrood site was not entered into the picture until after the official closure date of the competition between the three sites. The date for announcing the winner overran and on the date of the expected announcement instead it was announced that they were going to "rethink their decision" (inferring that indeed a decision had been made) and add the Holyrood Brewery site into the running (which had only just closed). However negotiations with the brewing company <a href="Scottish%20and%20Newcastle">Scottish and Newcastle</a>, who owned the land, resulted in the company indicating that they would be able to vacate the site in early 1999. As a consequence, the Secretary of State for Scotland agreed that the Holyrood site merited inclusion on the shortlist of proposed locations. The Scottish Office commissioned feasibility studies of the specified areas in late 1997 and in January 1998, the Holyrood site was selected from the shortlist.

Following on from the site selection, the Scottish Office announced that an international competition would be held to find a designer for a new building to house the Parliament. A design committee was appointed under the chairmanship of Dewar, and was tasked with choosing from a shortlist of designs. Proposals were submitted from internationally renowned architects such as <a href="Rafael%20Vi%C3%B1oly">Rafael Viñoly</a>, <a href="Michael%20Wilford">Michael Wilford</a> and <a href="Richard%20Meier">Richard Meier</a>. Twelve designs were selected in March 1998, which were whittled down to five by the following May. The five final designs were put on public display throughout Scotland in June 1998. Feedback from the public displays showed that the designs of the Spanish architect <a href="Enric%20Miralles">Enric Miralles</a> were amongst the most popular. The design team took account of public opinion on the designs and invited all five shortlisted entrants to make presentations on their proposed designs before announcing a winner.

On 6 July 1998, it was declared that the design of Enric Miralles was chosen, with work being awarded to EMBT/<a href="RMJM">RMJM</a> (Scotland) Ltd, a Spanish-Scottish <a href="joint%20venture">joint venture</a> design company, specifically created for the project. Construction, which was undertaken by <a href="Bovis%20Lend%20Lease">Bovis</a>, commenced in June 1999, with the demolition of the Scottish and Newcastle brewery and the beginning of foundation work to support the structure of the building. MSPs began to move into the building complex in the Summer of 2004, with the official opening by the Queen taking place in October of the same year.

Miralles sought to design a parliament building that could represent and present a <a href="Scottish%20national%20identity">national identity</a>. This intractably difficult question was tackled by displacing the question of identity into the landscape of Scotland. In a characteristically poetic approach he talked about slotting the building into the land "in the form of a gathering situation: an <a href="amphitheatre">amphitheatre</a>, coming out from Arthur's Seat." where the building would reflect a dialogue between the landscape and the act of people sitting. So an early goal of the design was to open the building and its public spaces, not just to Edinburgh but to a more general concept of the Scottish landscape. Miralles intended to use the parliament to help build the end of Canongate—"not just another building on the street...it should reinforce the existing qualities of the site and its surroundings. In a subtle game of cross views and political implications."

The result was a non-hierarchical, organic collection of low-lying buildings intended to allow views of, and blend in with, the surrounding rugged scenery and symbolise the connection between <a href="Wildlife%20of%20Scotland">nature</a> and the Scottish people. As a consequence the building has many features connected to nature and land, such as the leaf shaped motifs of the roof in the Garden Lobby of the building, and the large windows of the debating chamber, committee rooms and the Tower Buildings which face the broad expanse of Holyrood Park, Arthur's Seat and Salisbury Crags. Inside the buildings, the connection to the land is reinforced by the use of <a href="Geology%20of%20Scotland">Scottish rock</a> such as <a href="gneiss">gneiss</a> and <a href="granite">granite</a> in the flooring and walls, and the use of <a href="oak">oak</a> and <a href="sycamore">sycamore</a> in the construction of the furniture.

The Parliament is actually a campus of several buildings, reflecting different architectural styles, with a total floor area of 31,000 square metres (312,000 sq ft), providing accommodation for MSPs, their researchers and parliamentary staff. The buildings have a variety of features, with the most distinctive external characterisation being the roof of the Tower Buildings, said to be reminiscent of upturned boats on the shoreline. The inspiration had come from <a href="Edwin%20Lutyens">Edwin Lutyens</a>' sheds, made from upturned herring busses (boats) which Miralles saw on a visit to <a href="Lindisfarne">Lindisfarne</a> in <a href="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>. It is said that in the first design meeting, Miralles, armed with some twigs and leaves, thrust them onto a table and declared "This is the Scottish Parliament" reinforcing the unique and abstract nature of the parliamentary campus.

The north-western boundaries of the site, the MSPs' building, Queensberry House and the Canongate Building reinforce the existing medieval street patterns "expressing intimacy with the city and its citizens". The south-eastern aspect of the complex is extensively landscaped. Concrete "branches", covered in turf and wild grass extend from the parliamentary buildings, and provide members of the public with somewhere to sit and relax. Indigenous Scottish wildflowers and plants cover much of the area, blending the Parliament's grounds with the nearby Holyrood Park and Salisbury Crags. Oak, Rowan, Lime and Cherry trees have also been planted in the grounds. Adjacent to the landscaped area of the complex, where it meets Horse Wynd, there is an open plan piazza, with bike racks, seating and external lighting shaped like rocks incorporated into concrete paving. Three distinctive water features provide the centrepiece for this area.

References to Scottish culture are also reflected in the building and particularly on some of the building's elevations. There are a series of "trigger panels", constructed out of timber or granite. Not to everyone's taste, these have been said to represent <a href="anvil">anvil</a>s, hairdryers, guns, question marks or even the <a href="hammer%20and%20sickle">hammer and sickle</a>. Shortly after the official opening of the building, Enric Miralles' widow, <a href="Benedetta%20Tagliabue">Benedetta Tagliabue</a>, revealed that the design is simply that of a window curtain pulled back. Her late husband however, enjoying the use of ambiguous forms with multiple meanings, had previously said he would love the profile to evoke an icon of Scottish culture, the painting of <a href="The%20Skating%20Minister">Reverend Walker skating on ice</a>. The architectural critic <a href="Charles%20Jencks">Charles Jencks</a> finds this a particularly apt <a href="metaphor">metaphor</a> for balanced movement and democratic debate and also notes the irony that Miralles too was skating on ice with his designs for the building. Elsewhere, in the public area beneath the debating chamber, the curved concrete vaults carry various stylised <a href="Flag%20of%20Scotland">Saltires</a>. Here the architect intends another metaphor; by setting the debating chamber directly above the public area, he seeks to remind MSPs whilst sitting in the chamber that their power derives from the people below them.

The Scottish Parliament Building is open to visitors all year round. On non-sitting days, normally Mondays, Fridays and weekends as well as during parliamentary recess periods, visitors are able to view the Main Hall of the building and can access the public galleries of the debating chamber and main committee rooms. Guided tours are also available on non-sitting days and these allow visitors access to the floor of the chamber, the Garden Lobby, <a href="Queensberry%20House">Queensberry House</a> and committee rooms in the company of a parliamentary guide. On sitting days, members of the public must purchase tickets for the public galleries of both the chamber and committee rooms.

The Scottish Parliament Building was designed with a number of sustainability features in mind. The decision to build the Parliament on a <a href="brownfield">brownfield</a> site and its proximity to hubs of <a href="Transport%20in%20Scotland">public transport</a> are seen as sustainable, environmentally friendly features. All of the electricity purchased for the building comes from renewable sources and <a href="Solar%20hot%20water%20panel">solar panels</a> on the Canongate Building are used for heating water in the complex.

A high level of insulation was used to keep the building warm during the winter months. This approach, however, brings with it the potential problem of overheating during the summer due to solar heat gains through the glazing, body heat and the use of computers and electric lighting. Standard solutions to the problem usually involve using energy intensive <a href="HVAC">HVAC</a> systems. The Scottish Parliament Building, however, reduces the requirements for such systems to only 20% of the accommodation by a variety of strategies. Natural ventilation is used wherever possible. A computerised management system senses the temperature in different parts of the Parliament and automatically opens windows to keep the building cool. During summer months, the building opens the windows during the night time when it is unoccupied and permits the heavy concrete floors and structure to cool and rid themselves of heat absorbed during the day. This then helps to keep the building temperature down during the day by absorbing the excess heat from the glazing, occupants and electrical equipment. Some of the concrete floors are further cooled by water from 25 metres (80 ft) deep <a href="bore%20hole">bore hole</a>s beneath the parliamentary campus which also provide water for the toilet facilities. The building achieves the highest rating in the <a href="Building%20Research%20Establishment">Building Research Establishment</a>'s Environmental Assessment Method (<a href="BREEAM">BREEAM</a>).

The debating chamber contains a shallow elliptical horseshoe of seating for the MSPs, with the governing party or parties sitting in the middle of the <a href="Hemicycle%20%28chamber%29">semicircle</a> and opposition parties on either side, similar to other European legislatures. Such a layout is intended to blur political divisions and principally reflects the desire to encourage consensus amongst elected members. This is in contrast to the "adversarial" layout reminiscent of other <a href="Westminster%20System">Westminster style national legislatures</a>, including the <a href="British%20House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a>, where government and opposition sit apart and facing one another. There are 131 desks and chairs on the floor of the chamber for all the elected members of the Scottish Parliament and members of the Scottish Government. The desks are constructed out of oak and sycamore and are fitted with a lectern, a microphone and in-built speakers as well as the <a href="electronic%20voting">electronic voting</a> equipment used by MSPs. Galleries above the main floor can accommodate a total of 255 members of the public, 18 guests and 34 members of the press.

The most notable feature of the chamber is the roof. The roof is supported by a structure of <a href="Glued%20laminated%20timber">laminated</a> <a href="oak">oak</a> beams joined with a total of 112 <a href="stainless%20steel">stainless steel</a> connectors (each slightly different), which in turn are suspended on steel rods from the walls. The connecting nodes were fabricated by <a href="welder">welder</a>s for <a href="Economy%20of%20Scotland">Scotland's oil industry</a>. Such a structure enables the debating chamber to span over 30 metres (100 ft) without any supporting columns. In entering the chamber, MSPs pass under a stone <a href="lintel">lintel</a>—the <a href="Arniston%20Stone">Arniston Stone</a>—that was once part of the pre-1707 Parliament building, <a href="Parliament%20House%2C%20Edinburgh">Parliament House</a>. The use of the Arniston Stone in the structure of the debating chamber symbolises the connection between the historical <a href="Parliament%20of%20Scotland">Parliament of Scotland</a> and the present day Scottish Parliament.

Cut into the western wall of the debating chamber are laminated glass panels, of different shapes, intended to give a human dimension to the chamber. At night, light is shone through the glass panels and is projected onto the MSPs' desks to create the impression that the chamber is never unoccupied. Natural light diffuses into the chamber and is provided by "glass fins" which run down from light spaces in the ceiling. Glimpses out of the chamber are given to the landscape and city beyond, intentionally, to visually connect the MSPs to Scotland. The necessities of a modern parliament, banks of light, cameras, electronic voting and the MSPs' console have all been transformed into works of craft and art, displaying the sweeping curves and leaf motifs that inform the rest of the building. Such is the level of craftsmanship, a result of the union of Miralles' inventive designs, superb detailing by RMJM and excellent craftsmanship in execution, that Jencks was prompted to state that the [Parliament] is "an <a href="Arts%20and%20Crafts%20movement">arts and crafts</a> building, designed with high-tech flair. You really have to go back to the Houses of Parliament in London to get interior design of such a high creative level—in fact, it is more creative".

On 2 March 2006, a beam in the roof of the debating chamber swung loose from its hinges during a debate, resulting in the evacuation of the debating chamber and the suspension of parliamentary business. Parliament moved to other premises while the whole roof structure was inspected and remedial works were carried out. The structural engineers, <a href="Arup%20Group%20Limited">Arup</a>, stated that the problem with the collapsed beam was entirely due to the failure of one bolt and the absence of another. There was no design fault. The engineers concluded, in a report to MSPs, that the damage is likely to have been done during construction work on the chamber roof, in the latter phases of the project. The report also indicated that whilst one of the bolts was missing, the other was broken and had damaged threads commensurate with being overtightened or jammed, which twisted the head off, or came close to doing so.

The Garden Lobby is at the centre of the parliamentary complex and connects the debating chamber, committee rooms and administrative offices of the Tower Buildings, with <a href="Queensberry%20House">Queensberry House</a> and the MSP building. The Garden Lobby is the place where official events as well as <a href="Television%20in%20Scotland">television</a> interviews normally take place and it is used as an open social space for MSPs and parliamentary staff.
The main feature of the Garden Lobby are the rooflights, which when viewed from above resemble leaves or the early <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> "<a href="Vesica%20piscis">vesica</a>" shape and allow natural light into the building. The rooflights are made from stainless steel and the glasswork is covered by a lattice of solid oak struts. The route through the Garden Lobby up the main staircase to the debating chamber has been described as "one of the great processional routes in contemporary <a href="architecture">architecture</a>."

The MSP building is connected to the Tower Buildings by way of the Garden Lobby and stands at the western end of the parliamentary complex, adjoining Reid's Close. The block contains offices for each MSP and two members of staff, fitted out with custom-designed furniture. The building is between four and six storeys in height, and is clad in granite. MSPs occupy 108 of the total 114 rooms in the building. Each office is divided into two parts—one for the MSP, with a floor space of 15 square metres (160 sq ft) and another part for their staff, which has a floor space of 12 square metres (130 sq ft). The most distinctive feature of the MSP block are the unusual windows which project out from the building onto the western elevation of the parliamentary complex, inspired by a combination of the repeated leaf motif and the traditional Scottish <a href="stepped%20gable">stepped gable</a>. In each office, these bay windows have a seat and shelving and are intended as "contemplation spaces". Constructed from stainless steel and framed in oak, with oak lattices covering the glass, the windows are designed to provide MSPs with privacy and shade from the sun. Ahead of the opening of the Parliament, some MSPs who questioned whether the design would allow sufficient natural light into their offices. To remove the uniformity from the western side of the building, the windows jut out at different widths and angles. At its north end, the building is six storeys high (ground floor plus five) stepping down to four storeys (ground floor plus three) at the south end.

Four tower buildings fan out along the front, or eastern edge, of the parliamentary complex and are notable for the curvature of their roofs. The Tower Buildings are home to the public entrance of the Scottish Parliament and to the Main Hall which is located on the eastern side of the parliamentary complex, beneath the debating chamber. A stone <a href="vaulted%20ceiling">vaulted ceiling</a> is the principal feature of the Main Hall, which has cross like representations carved into it, reminiscent of the <a href="Flag%20of%20Scotland">Saltire</a>—the national flag of Scotland. The main hall contains permanent exhibitions on the role of the Scottish Parliament, as well as public seating, a visitor information desk, a shop, lockers and a <a href="Day%20care">creche</a>. Like much of the parliamentary complex, the materials used to construct the Main Hall and its vaulted ceiling include <a href="Kemnay">Kemnay</a> Granite from <a href="Aberdeenshire">Aberdeenshire</a> in north east Scotland and <a href="Caithness">Caithness</a> stone which is used in much of the flooring in the buildings. Connected to the Tower Buildings in the eastern portion of the complex are the Media and Canongate Buildings, which house the <a href="Information%20technology">IT</a> and <a href="procurement">procurement</a> departments of the Parliament, as well as media offices and the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe). The centrepiece of the Canongate Building is a two-storey <a href="cantilever">cantilever</a> structure, with the building connected at one end by reinforced concrete and 18 metres (60 ft) of the building suspended above ground and protruding outwards unsupported by any columns.

Originally dating from 1667, <a href="Queensberry%20House">Queensberry House</a> is an example of a seventeenth century Edinburgh <a href="townhouse">townhouse</a> and contrasts with the modern <a href="architecture">architecture</a> of the rest of the parliamentary complex. From c.1800, Queensberry House has been used as a hospital, army barracks, a refuge and a geriatric hospital. In 1996, the geriatric hospital closed and the building was incorporated into the Scottish and Newcastle brewery, who owned the surrounding site. The building has been extensively refurbished, and returned to its original height of three storeys to provide facilities for the <a href="Presiding%20Officer%20of%20the%20Scottish%20Parliament">Presiding Officer</a>, Deputy Presiding Officers, the Chief Executive of the Scottish Parliament and various parliamentary support staff. Internally and externally the building has been strengthened with reinforced steel and concrete. The original timber flooring has been replaced throughout with a mixture of carpet, vinyl, oak and Caithness stone. Queensberry House also contains the Donald Dewar Room, dedicated to the founding First Minister of Scotland who died in October 2000. The room hosts the personal collection of books and other memorabilia donated to the Parliament by the family of Donald Dewar after his death.

The Scottish Parliament holds a wide variety of artwork and sculpture ranging from specially commissioned pieces to official gifts from overseas parliamentary delegations. The intention of including artwork and sculptures in the building reinforces the desire of Miralles that the project should reflect the nature of Scotland, particularly its land and people. In order to facilitate the incorporation of art into the building, a consultative steering group was established by the <a href="Scottish%20Parliamentary%20Corporate%20Body">Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body</a> (SPCB) under the chairmanship of <a href="Jamie%20Stone%20%28Scottish%20politician%29">Jamie Stone MSP</a> with the remit of deciding which artworks should be chosen. Some pieces of artwork are on public display in the building. 

As well as artwork and sculptures, quotations, furniture and photography have been commissioned as part of the art strategy. A range of quotations have been inscribed onto the stonework in and around the parliamentary complex. Beneath the Canongate Building façade is the Canongate Wall, constructed from a variety of indigenous Scottish rocks such as <a href="Lewisian%20complex">Lewisian gneiss</a>, <a href="Torridonian%20sandstone">Torridonian sandstone</a> and <a href="Easdale">Easdale</a> <a href="slate">slate</a>. The stones are set into large concrete casts, each one inscribed with a quotation. The Canongate Wall contains a total of 24 quotations. Etched along the lower stretch of the wall is a pictorial representation of the <a href="Old%20Town%2C%20Edinburgh">Old Town</a> of Edinburgh-based around a sketch by Enric Miralles showing the view of the Old Town from his bedroom window in the <a href="Balmoral%20Hotel">Balmoral Hotel</a>.
The Main Hall of the Parliament contains a number of distinctive features and sculptures, including the gold-plated "Honours of Scotland" sculpture. Presented by the Queen upon the opening of the Parliament building, the sculpture is modelled on the actual <a href="Honours%20of%20Scotland">Honours of Scotland</a>, the <a href="Crown%20%28headgear%29">crown</a>, <a href="sceptre">sceptre</a> and the <a href="sword">sword</a> of the state, and combines these three separate elements into one composition. During meetings of the original Parliament of Scotland, the actual Honours were always present but since 1819 they have been permanently housed in <a href="Edinburgh%20Castle">Edinburgh Castle</a>. The 11 m (36 ft) long Visitor Information Desk also stands in the Main Hall. Commissioned by the art strategy group, the desk combines a unique design constructed from oak and sycamore and functions as a workstation for six members of parliamentary staff. At a cost of £88,000 the desk has been criticised by some over its price and functionality.

Another feature gifted to the Scottish Parliament by the Queen, following its inauguration in July 1999, is the parliamentary <a href="Ceremonial%20mace">mace</a>. The mace is housed in a glass case in the debating chamber and has a formal, ceremonial role during meetings of the Parliament. The mace sits in front of the Presiding Officers' desk and is made from silver and inlaid with gold <a href="Gold%20panning">panned</a> from <a href="Scottish%20rivers">Scottish rivers</a> and inscribed with the words "Wisdom", "Compassion", "Justice" and "Integrity". The words "There shall be a Scottish Parliament" (which are the first words of the <a href="Scotland%20Act%201998">Scotland Act 1998</a>), are inscribed around the head of the mace. At the beginning of each session in the chamber, the case is removed to symbolise that a full meeting of the Parliament is taking place.

Public reaction to the design of the building has been mixed. In the first 6 months of the building being open to the public, 250,000 people visited it, which <a href="Presiding%20Officer%20of%20the%20Scottish%20Parliament">Presiding Officer</a> <a href="George%20Reid%20%28Scottish%20politician%29">George Reid</a> has said showed the public were "voting with their feet". Critics of the building, such as <a href="Margo%20MacDonald">Margo MacDonald</a> MSP, have pointed out that the high number of visitors does not prove that all of them like the building. As well as cost, criticisms of the building stem primarily from the <a href="Modernist%20architecture">modernist</a> and abstract architecture, the quality of the building work and the location of the building.

The mixed public reaction contrasts sharply with the response from architectural critics. Its rampant complexity, iconography and layering of meaning and metaphor are widely regarded as producing a building which is "quite a meal". This prompted Catherine Slessor, writing in the "<a href="Architectural%20Review">Architectural Review</a>", to describe it as "A Celtic-Spanish cocktail to blow both minds and budgets, it doesn't play safe, energetically mining a new seam of National Romanticism refined and reinterpreted for the twenty-first century." Jencks attempted to dampen criticism of the <a href="cost%20overruns">cost overruns</a> by questioning how 'value for money' might be judged. For him, the building is not just a functional or economic enterprise, it is an exploration of <a href="Scottish%20national%20identity">national identity</a> and in comparing it to other comparable assemblies, not least the <a href="Palace%20of%20Westminster">Palace of Westminster</a>, he argues the cost is comparable. The conception of the building has been singled out for praise, particularly in the way it re-establishes Scotland's traditional focus towards <a href="mainland%20Europe">mainland Europe</a> and its values by means of the layout of the non-adversarial debating chamber and the creation of the public spaces in front of the building, "where people can meet and express themselves as a force". In an era of the <a href="Bilbao%20effect">Bilbao effect</a> and the iconic building, Jencks is impressed that rather than being a monumental building, as is usual for capital landmarks, the building creates a complex union of nature and culture that nestles itself into the landscape.

The building has also won a number of awards, including an award at the VIII Biennial of Spanish Architecture, the <a href="Royal%20Incorporation%20of%20Architects%20in%20Scotland%23RIAS%20Award%20for%20Architecture">RIAS Andrew Doolan Award for Architecture</a>, and the 2005 <a href="Stirling%20Prize">Stirling Prize</a>, the UK's most prestigious architecture award. The inclusion of the Scottish Parliament Building on the shortlist for the Stirling Prize in 2004, led the judges to describe the building as "a statement of sparkling excellence". In October 2005 the building was identified as <a href="Prospect%20100%20best%20modern%20Scottish%20buildings">Scotland's 4th greatest modern building</a> by readers of <a href="Prospect%20%28architecture%20magazine%29">"Prospect" magazine</a>. In 2004 the satirical magazine <a href="Private%20Eye">Private Eye</a> also conferred the building with their <a href="List%20of%20winners%20of%20the%20Sir%20Hugh%20Casson%20Award">Sir Hugh Casson Award</a> for "worst new building of the year".

The construction of the Scottish Parliament Building has generated controversy in several respects. Rising costs and the use of public money to fund the project generated most controversy. Initial estimates for constructing a new building were projected to be between £10m and £40m in 1997. By early 2004, the estimated final cost of the project was set at £430m, some ten times greater.

Notwithstanding the level of controversy surrounding cost, the Scottish Parliament Building proved controversial in a number of other respects: the decision to construct a new building, the choice of site, the selection of a non-Scottish architect, and the selection of <a href="Bovis%20Homes%20Group">Bovis</a> as construction manager after having earlier been excluded from the shortlist. In 1997, the initial cost of constructing a new Parliament building was given as £40 million, a figure produced by the Scottish Office, prior to the September 1997 devolution referendum, and subsequently revealed to be the figure for housing MSPs. Further controversy surrounding the project sprang from the selection of the Holyrood site, which was a late entrant onto the list of sites to be considered, and the rejection of the Royal High School on Calton Hill, long thought to be the home of any future <a href="devolved">devolved</a> Scottish Parliament. After a formal visit to the Royal High School by Dewar and his aides on 30 May 1997, it was rejected as unsuitable on the grounds of size and location.

Control of the building project passed from the Scottish Office to the cross-party <a href="Scottish%20Parliamentary%20Corporate%20Body">Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body</a> (SPCB) on 1 June 1999, headed by the Parliament's then Presiding Officer, Sir David Steel, at a time of increasing costs. Rising costs sprang from the need for a formal entrance and the need to accommodate parliamentary staff in light of better knowledge of how Parliament was working at its primary location on the Royal Mile, where it was clear there were staff overcrowding problems. With the cost increases in mind, and heightened media interest in the Holyrood Project, the Members of the Scottish Parliament held a debate on whether to continue with construction on 17 June 1999 voting by a majority of 66 to 57 in favour to complete the project.

In August 1999, the architect informed the project group that the Parliament would need to be further increased in size by 4,000 square metres (43,000 sq ft). A subsequent costing revealed that taking into account the increased floorspace net construction costs had risen to £115m by September 1999. Early in 2000, the SPCB commissioned an independent report by the architect John Spencely. The report concluded that savings of 20% could be made on the current project and that scrapping the project completely at that stage or moving to another site would entail additional costs of £30m. Spencely also cited poor communication between the SPCB and construction officials as increasingly costly. Given the outcomes of the Spencely report, MSPs voted to continue with the construction project on the Holyrood site in a debate in the Scottish Parliament on 5 April 2000.

The project was also complicated by the deaths of Miralles in July 2000, of Dewar the following October and the existence of a multi-headed client consisting of the SPCB, the Presiding Officer and an architectural advisor. The client took over the running of the project from the Scottish Executive (formerly the Scottish Office) while it was already under construction. Subsequently, the events of <a href="9/11">9/11</a> led to further design changes, especially with regard to security, which again resulted in rising costs. However, it was later rejected that the re-designs required to incorporate greater security into the building structure were the "single biggest" factor affecting the increased costs of the project.

By March 2004 the cost had reached the sum of £430m (compared to an original budget of £55m in July 1998 when the architects were appointed). This equates to £85 for each of the 5.1 million people in Scotland. A report published by the <a href="Auditor%20General%20for%20Scotland">Auditor General for Scotland</a> in July 2004 specifically identified elements that contributed to both increasing costs and the delay in completing the project. His report criticised the overall management of the project and stated that had the management and construction process been executed better, costs could have been reduced. The report attempted to identify the reasons why there had been an acceleration in cost from £195m in September 2000 to £431m in February 2004 and concluded that over 2000 design changes to the project were a major factor. The building was finally certified for occupation in the Summer of 2004, with the official opening in October of the same year, three years behind schedule.

In May 2003 the First Minister, <a href="Jack%20McConnell">Jack McConnell</a>, announced a major <a href="public%20inquiry">public inquiry</a> into the handling of the building project. The inquiry (known as the Holyrood Inquiry, or the Fraser Inquiry) was headed by <a href="Peter%20Fraser%2C%20Lord%20Fraser%20of%20Carmyllie">Lord Fraser of Carmyllie</a> and held at the <a href="Scottish%20Land%20Court">Scottish Land Court</a> in Edinburgh. The inquiry took evidence from architects, civil servants, politicians and the building companies. Evidence was taken over the course of 49 hearings and the final report ran to 300 pages.

Presenting his report in September 2004, Lord Fraser told how he was "astonished" that year after year the ministers who were in charge were kept so much in the dark over the increases in cost estimates. He also stated that a Parliament building of sufficient scale could never have been built for less than £50m, and was "amazed" that the belief that it could be was perpetuated for so long. He believed that from at least April 2000, when MSPs commissioned the Spencely Report to decide whether the building should continue, it should have been realised that the building was bound to cost in excess of £200m. Furthermore, £150m of the final cost was wasted as a result of design delays, over-optimistic programming and uncertain authority.

Despite having only an outline design, the designers RMJM/EMBT (Scotland) Ltd stated without foundation that the building could be completed within a £50m budget. Nevertheless, these estimates were believed by officials. The two architectural practices in the RMJM and EMBT joint venture operated dysfunctionally and failed to communicate effectively with each other and the project manager. The death of Miralles also gave rise to a substantial period of disharmony. The Brief emphasised the importance of design and quality over cost, and was not updated despite considerable evolution of the design. Ministers were not informed of grave concerns within the Scottish Office over the cost of the project and officials failed to take the advice of the cost consultants.

The Scottish Office decided to procure the construction work under a "<a href="construction%20management%20contract">construction management contract</a>", rather than under a <a href="Private%20Finance%20Initiative">Private Finance Initiative</a>, in order to speed construction, but without properly evaluating the financial risks of doing so, and – in a decision that Fraser stated "beggars belief" – without asking Ministers to approve it. This was one of the two most flawed decisions which the report singled out, the other was the insistence on a rigid programme. Officials decided that rapid delivery of the new building was to be the priority, but that quality should be maintained. It was therefore inevitable that the cost would suffer. The client was obsessed with early completion and failed to understand the impact on cost and the completion date if high-quality work and a complex building were required. In attempting to achieve early completion, the management contractor produced optimistic programmes, to which the architects were unwise to commit. The main causes of the slippage were delays in designing a challenging project that was to be delivered against a tight timetable using an unusual <a href="procurement">procurement</a> route.

The inquiry was widely seen as clearing Donald Dewar for the initial mishandling of the project. This came after speculation suggesting that Dewar was aware that the initial costs of a new Parliament Building, circulated to the public, were too low. However, in his report, Lord Fraser stated "there was no evidence whatsoever, that he [Dewar] deliberately or knowingly misled MSPs. He relied on cost figures given to him by senior civil servants." The inquiry also resisted the temptation to "lay all of the blame at the door of a deceased wayward architectural genius [Miralles]...costs rose because the client wanted increases and changes or at least approved of them in one manifestation or other."

In his report, Lord Fraser set out a number of recommendations stemming from the inquiry. Primarily, in terms of design selection and when using an international architect linking with a Scottish-based firm, the report advised that a full analysis of the compatibility of different working cultures and practices needs to be made.

Lord Fraser advocated that when "construction management" contracts were used, civil servants or <a href="Local%20government%20of%20Scotland">local government</a> officials should evaluate the risks of such a contract and set out the advantages and disadvantages of embarking upon such a route before their political superiors. Alongside that recommendation, Lord Fraser stated that independent advisors should be retained and have the ability to communicate their advice to ministers, without those views being "filtered" by public officials. Similarly, where civil servants are part of large project management contracts, clear guidelines of governance should be set out and be as rigorous as standards applied in the <a href="private%20sector">private sector</a>.

Following publication of the report, Jack McConnell stated that the Fraser recommendations would be fully implemented, and that fundamental reform of the civil service was already under way, with trained professionals being recruited to handle such projects. The First Minister emphasised that he was keen to see an increase in the specialist skills of civil servants, in order for them to be able to administer projects of such magnitude in the future. <a href="John%20Elvidge">John Elvidge</a>, the most senior civil servant in Scotland, admitted that best practice had not been followed and apologised for the way the project had been handled. He did not rule out the possibility of taking disciplinary action against civil service staff, although subsequent Scottish Government investigations resulted in no action being taken against individual public officials involved with the project.

In 2015, the pro-independence group <a href="People%27s%20Voice%20%28Scottish%20pro-independence%20group%29">People's Voice</a> established a <a href="IndyCamp%20Live">demonstration camp</a> on the grounds of the Scottish parliament demanding independence. this camp was objected to as it risked infringing on the political neutrality of the parliamentary estate and prevented others from using the grounds. Sheriff officers issued the campers with a notice ordering them to leave, however the campers refused.

Arena (countermeasure)

Arena () is an <a href="active%20protection%20system">active protection system</a> (APS) developed at <a href="Russia">Russia</a>'s <a href="Kolomna">Kolomna</a>-based Engineering Design Bureau for the purpose of protecting <a href="armoured%20fighting%20vehicle">armoured fighting vehicle</a>s from destruction by light <a href="anti-tank">anti-tank</a> weapons, <a href="anti-tank%20guided%20missile">anti-tank guided missile</a>s (ATGM), and missiles with <a href="top%20attack">top attack</a> warheads. It uses a <a href="Doppler%20radar">Doppler radar</a> to detect incoming warheads. Upon detection, a defensive rocket is fired that detonates near the inbound threat, destroying it before it hits the vehicle.

"Arena" is the successor to "<a href="Drozd">Drozd</a>", a Soviet active protection system from the late 1970s, which was installed on several <a href="T-54/55">T-55s</a> during the <a href="Soviet%E2%80%93Afghan%20War">Soviet–Afghan War</a>. The system improved the vehicle's survivability rate, increasing it by up to 80%. "Drozd" was followed by "<a href="Shtora">Shtora</a>" in the late 1980s, which used an electro-magnetic <a href="Radar%20jamming%20and%20deception%23Electronic%20jamming">jammer</a> to confuse inbound enemy anti-tank missiles and rockets. In late 1994 the Russian Army deployed a large number of <a href="armoured%20fighting%20vehicles">armoured fighting vehicles</a> to <a href="Chechnya">Chechnya</a>, where they were ambushed and suffered heavy casualties. The effectiveness of <a href="Mujahideen">Chechen</a> <a href="rocket-propelled%20grenade">rocket-propelled grenade</a>s against Russian combat vehicles prompted the "Kolomenskoye" machine-building design bureau to devise the "Arena" active protection system in the early and mid-1990s. An export variant, "Arena-E", was also developed. The system has been tested on the <a href="T-80">T-80UM-1</a>, demonstrated at Omsk in 1997, and was considered for use on the <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a>n <a href="K2%20Black%20Panther">K2 Black Panther</a> main battle tank.

The <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> developed the first <a href="active%20protection%20system">active protection system</a> between 1977 and 1982, named "Drozd" (Russian: Дрозд). This system was designed as an alternative to passive or <a href="reactive%20armour">reactive armour</a>, to defend against enemy <a href="Shoulder-launched%20missile%20weapon">anti-tank weapons</a>. The system's development was stimulated in large part by the introduction of new <a href="high%20explosive%20anti-tank%20warhead">high explosive anti-tank warhead</a>s. "Drozd" was designed to destroy these warheads before they hit the armour of the vehicle being attacked. It was composed of three main parts: two launcher arrays placed on either side of the <a href="Gun%20turret">turret</a> and an auxiliary power unit located to the rear of the turret. The arrays were controlled by two <a href="millimeter-wave">millimeter-wave</a> <a href="radar">radar</a> antennae. The system used a , cone-shaped fragmentation warhead. "Drozd" could protect a tank between the elevations of −6 and 20 degrees along the vertical plane, and between 40 and 60 degrees along the horizontal plane. Although reported to offer an 80% increase in survival rate during its testing in <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, the radar was unable to adequately detect threats and the firing of its rockets caused unacceptably high levels of <a href="collateral%20damage">collateral damage</a>. About 250 "Drozd" systems were manufactured, all of which were installed on <a href="T-54/55">T-55</a>s belonging to the Soviet Union's <a href="Naval%20Infantry%20%28Russia%29">naval infantry</a>.

In the late 1980s, the Soviet Army began development of the <a href="Shtora">"Shtora"-1</a> electro-optical jammer. It was first mounted on a <a href="T-80">T-80U</a> in 1989, and later showcased on a <a href="T-72">T-72B</a> (renamed T-72BM and later <a href="T-90">T-90</a>). "Shtora"-1 is designed to jam incoming anti-tank missiles using a one-kilowatt <a href="infrared">infrared</a> radiator. In 1995, it was fitted on a <a href="Ukraine">Ukrainian</a> <a href="T-84">T-84</a>. The "Shtora"-1 system consists of an infra-red radiator interface station, composed of the jammer, modulator and control panel, a number of forward-firing grenade discharges capable of producing a smoke screen, a <a href="laser%20warning%20receiver">laser warning receiver</a> and a general control panel. "Shtora" offers 360 degree all-around protection, between the elevations of −5 and 25 degrees. The system is activated when the laser warning system alerts the tank commander, who responds by pressing a button on his control panel which automatically orients the turret towards the threat. This triggers the grenade launch, creating a smoke screen to reduce the ability of the missile to lock-on the vehicle. The jammers are designed to jam the infra-red seekers on the inbound missiles. According to the manufacturers, "Shtora" decreases the chances of a tank being hit by an anti-tank missile, such as the <a href="M47%20Dragon">Dragon</a>, by a factor of 4–5:1.

The large number of Russia's casualties during the <a href="First%20Chechen%20War">First Chechen War</a> prompted Russia to consider the development of a new active protection system. During the <a href="Battle%20of%20Grozny%20%281994%E2%80%931995%29">Battle of Grozny</a>, for example, the Russian Army lost between 200 and 250 <a href="armoured%20fighting%20vehicles">armoured fighting vehicles</a> to Chechen rebels. Vehicles which were knocked-out included main battle tanks such as the T-72 and T-80, and lighter armoured vehicles such as the <a href="BMP-2">BMP-2</a>. The majority of tanks deployed to Chechnya were not issued with explosive reactive armour, due to the "lack of time and funds", while some of those that were issued with reactive armour did not have the explosive charge to start the reaction. Some of the most dangerous threats to Russian armour were <a href="rocket-propelled%20grenade">rocket-propelled grenade</a>s fired from buildings in Grozny. As a result of these vulnerabilities, "Kolomenskoye" developed the "Arena" active protection system, with the goal of providing Russian armour more reliable protection against these threats.

The "Arena" system was primarily designed to defeat threats such as the rocket propelled grenade and the anti-tank missile, including newer anti-tank missiles with longer ranges. The active protection system can protect against missiles fired from both infantry carried rocket launchers and from helicopters, which attack the vehicle directly or by overflying it. Modern rocket propelled grenades can penetrate almost of steel armour, posing a serious threat to tanks operating in environments of <a href="asymmetric%20warfare">asymmetric warfare</a>. Therefore, increased tank protection requires either an increase in armour thickness and weight, or alternatively the use of an active protection system, like "Arena".

The system uses a multi-function <a href="Doppler%20radar">Doppler radar</a>, which can be turned on and off by the tank commander. In conjunction with radar input, a digital computer scans an arc around the tank for threats, and evaluates which of the tank's 26 quick-action projectiles it will release to intercept the incoming threat. In selecting the projectile to use for defeating the threat, the ballistic computer employs the information processed by the radar, including information such as flight parameters and velocity. The computer has a reaction time of 0.05 seconds and protects the tank over a 300-degree arc, everywhere but the rear side of the <a href="gun%20turret">turret</a>. The system engages targets within of the vehicle it is defending, and the ammunition detonates at around from the threat. It will engage any threat approaching the tank between the velocities of and , and can detect false targets, such as outgoing projectiles, birds and small caliber bullets. "Arena" works during the day and night, and the lack of electromagnetic interference allows the system to be used by multiple vehicles as a team. The 27-volt system requires approximately one kilowatt of power, and weighs around . "Arena" increases a tank's probability of surviving a rocket-propelled grenade by between 1.5–2 times.

"Shtora" was a soft-kill system, designed to passively defeat anti-tank missiles by jamming their guidance systems. By contrast, "Arena" is a hard-kill system like "Drozd", designed to destroy the warhead through the use of munitions before the missile can engage the vehicle being protected.

The "Arena" active protection system was first tested at the <a href="Kubinka">Kubinka</a> proving grounds in early 1995, successfully defending a Russian tank against an anti-tank guided missile. A Russian T-80UM-1, with "Arena", was demonstrated to the public at <a href="Omsk">Omsk</a> in late 1997. "Arena" was also mounted on the <a href="BMP-3">BMP-3</a>M modernization package, developed by the "Kurganmashzavod" Joint Stock Company, although the package has received no export orders.

An export variant, named "Arena-E" (Арена-Э), is available, worth an estimated $300,000. According to Russia, it was selected to be used on the <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a>n <a href="K2%20Black%20Panther">K2</a> main battle tank, although this was not confirmed by South Korea.

M-6 (Michigan highway)

M-6, or the Paul B. Henry Freeway, is a <a href="freeway">freeway</a> and <a href="Michigan%20State%20Trunkline%20Highway%20System">state trunkline highway</a> in the United States that serves portions of southern <a href="Kent%20County%2C%20Michigan">Kent</a> and eastern <a href="Ottawa%20County%2C%20Michigan">Ottawa</a> counties south of <a href="Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan">Grand Rapids, Michigan</a>. Although the freeway is named for <a href="Paul%20B.%20Henry">Paul B. Henry</a>, local residents and the press continue to use the original name, South Beltline as well on occasion. The freeway connects <a href="Interstate%20196">Interstate 196</a> (I-196) on the west with <a href="Interstate%2096">I-96</a> on the east. M-6 also provides a connection to <a href="U.S.%20Highway%20131">U.S. Highway 131</a> (US 131) in the middle of its corridor while running through several <a href="township%20%28United%20States%29">townships</a> on the south side of the <a href="Grand%20Rapids%20metropolitan%20area">Grand Rapids metropolitan area</a> in <a href="Western%20Michigan">Western Michigan</a>. Each end is in a rural area while the central section has suburban development along the trunkline.

The freeway was originally conceived in the 1960s. It took 32 years to approve, plan, finance, and build the freeway from the time that the state first authorized funding in 1972 to the time of the ribbon-cutting ceremony in 2004 that opened the South Beltline to traffic. The project cost around $700 million or around $35 million per mile (approximately $22 million per kilometer). Initial construction started in November 1997, with the first phase opened in November 2001. The full freeway was opened in November 2004. The first phase of construction was completed in <a href="asphalt">asphalt</a>, while the second and third phases were built in concrete. The project was built with two firsts: the first <a href="single-point%20urban%20interchange">single-point urban interchange</a> (SPUI; ) in Michigan, and a new technique to apply the pavement markings, embedding them into the concrete to reduce the chance of a snowplow scraping them off. In advance of the opening of the freeway to traffic, the <a href="Michigan%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Michigan Department of Transportation</a> (MDOT) allowed the public to walk or bike the South Beltline in an open-house event called the "Southbelt Shuffle".

M-6 starts at exit 64 on I-196 in <a href="Ottawa%20County%2C%20Michigan">Ottawa County</a> near <a href="Hudsonville%2C%20Michigan">Hudsonville</a>. The freeway runs southeast from the interchange through the rural <a href="Georgetown%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Georgetown</a> and <a href="Jamestown%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Jamestown</a> townships toward the county line. Through this area, MDOT traffic surveys measured a traffic count of 27,117 vehicles on average per day, the lowest along the freeway, in 2010. At Kenowa Avenue, the South Beltline crosses into <a href="Byron%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Byron Township</a> in <a href="Kent%20County%2C%20Michigan">Kent County</a>. The freeway corridor is bounded on each side by farmland, scattered subdivisions, and small pockets of woodland. Near the Wilson Avenue interchange, M-6 curves to the northeast around the edge of the Ironwood Golf Course and heads for the interchange with Byron Center Avenue. On either side of the freeway at Byron Center Avenue, there are two hospitals, Metro Health and St. Mary's Southwest, the former located on the very southern edge of the city of <a href="Wyoming%2C%20Michigan">Wyoming</a>. Continuing east, the beltline curves to the southeast and into the <a href="cloverleaf%20interchange">cloverleaf interchange</a> complex at US 131. This "mammoth" interchange stretches over a half mile (0.8 km) in one direction and over a mile (1.6 km) in the other, encompassing 27 bridges and 18 retaining walls. This makes it the largest freeway interchange in <a href="Western%20Michigan">Western Michigan</a>. There are four overpasses which carry M-6 over the US 131 freeway: two for the main <a href="carriageway">carriageway</a>s in each direction and two for the <a href="Collector/distributor%20road">collector-distributor lanes</a> on each side. The auxiliary lanes funnel the traffic using the interchange off the main carriageways to eliminate conflicts between merging streams of traffic. In the eastbound direction, the collector-distributor lane also has access to a ramp for traffic bound for 68th Street, which runs parallel to, and south of, the M-6 freeway. No such access to 68th Street is provided for westbound M-6 traffic, although 68th Street traffic can access each direction of M-6 or US 131.
East of US 131, M-6 crosses over Division Avenue and enters <a href="Gaines%20Township%2C%20Kent%20County%2C%20Michigan">Gaines Township</a> through a series of sound barrier walls as the freeway ramps merge back into the main lanes. This area had the highest traffic counts in 2011 at 55,236 vehicles per day. Near Kalamazoo Avenue, the freeway passes through an area with retail businesses and movie theaters on each side of the interchange; to the northeast is <a href="East%20Kentwood%20High%20School">East Kentwood High School</a>. On the approach to the East Paris Avenue underpass, M-6 curves first to the northeast and then back to the southeast, passing near one of <a href="Steelcase">Steelcase</a>'s office buildings, the pyramid-shaped Corporate Development Center. The freeway begins to curve to the northeast as it crosses into <a href="Caledonia%20Township%2C%20Kent%20County%2C%20Michigan">Caledonia Township</a>, with an interchange for <a href="M-37%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-37</a> (Broadmoor Avenue) and an overpass for 60th Street. M-6 curves around the southeast side of the <a href="Gerald%20R.%20Ford%20International%20Airport">Gerald R. Ford International Airport</a> in <a href="Cascade%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Cascade Township</a>. As the South Beltline nears I-96, it crosses 48th Street next to the Thornapple Pointe Golf Course. The carriageway splits into ramps for each direction of I-96, the ramps to eastbound I-96 crossing over the <a href="Thornapple%20River">Thornapple River</a> in the process. This interchange marks the eastern terminus of the Paul B. Henry South Beltline Freeway. The entire length of the freeway is listed on the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a>, a system of roads important to the nation's economy, defense and mobility.

The <a href="right%20of%20way%20%28transportation%29">right-of-way</a> along M-6 includes a pedestrian path known as the <a href="Frederik%20Meijer%20Trail">Frederik Meijer Trail</a>. Previously called the M-6 Trail, it links the <a href="Kent%20Trails">Kent Trails</a> west of Byron Center Avenue in <a href="Wyoming%2C%20Michigan">Wyoming</a> with the <a href="Paul%20Henry%20Rail%20Trail">Paul Henry Rail Trail</a> at 60th Street and Wing Avenue by Paris Park in <a href="Kentwood%2C%20Michigan">Kentwood</a>.

The first appearance of M-6 was in 1926 as a road in <a href="Keweenaw%20County%2C%20Michigan">Keweenaw County</a> in the <a href="Upper%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Upper Peninsula</a>. The highway ran from <a href="U.S.%20Route%2041%20in%20Michigan">US 41</a> at <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Michigan">Phoenix</a> to north of <a href="Eagle%20River%2C%20Michigan">Eagle River</a>. The <a href="Michigan%20State%20Highway%20Department">Michigan State Highway Department</a> redesignated the highway as M-111 in 1938, and it was redesignated two years later to become a part of the route of <a href="M-26%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-26</a>.

In the late 1970s, during the second phase of construction of the <a href="Interstate%20696">I-696 (Walter P. Reuther Freeway)</a> in <a href="Metro%20Detroit">Metro Detroit</a>, <a href="lobbying">lobbying</a> efforts and lawsuits attempted to block construction of the central section. If successful, the efforts would have left the freeway with a gap in the middle between the first (western) and second (eastern) phases of construction. During this time, MDOT assigned M-6 to the eastern section of the freeway under construction. Signs were erected along the service roads that followed 11 Mile Road to connect the already built <a href="stack%20interchange">stack interchange</a> at <a href="Interstate%2075%20in%20Michigan">I-75</a> east to <a href="Interstate%2094%20in%20Michigan">I-94</a>. By the time the eastern freeway segment was completed in 1979, the signage for M-6 was removed and replaced with I-696 signage, leaving an gap in the I-696 freeway until completion of the central section in 1989.

The South Beltline Freeway near Grand Rapids was a project that took about 32 years to complete. The idea dates back to the 1940s, but serious proposals were not made until the 1960s. The 1955 planning map for the Grand Rapids area Interstate Highways included a freeway roughly along the M-6 corridor before I-96 and I-196 were shifted north and east to their current locations. An increase in the state <a href="gas%20tax">gas tax</a> was approved in 1972 with the goal to finance local road projects in the state, including the South Beltline. The project was anticipated to cost $30–100 million (equivalent to $– million in ) in June 1975 with an expected groundbreaking in 1982–85. The highway was studied in January 1981 for $144,000 (equivalent to $ in ). The choice of consultants on the project was controversial; local planners felt that MDOT picked BKI Inc. only because they used a <a href="Minority%20business%20enterprise">minority-owned subcontractor</a> and not because they would be qualified for the assignment.

As this study was initiated, the route for the proposed freeway was located between 60th and 68th streets with a western end in <a href="Hudsonville%2C%20Michigan">Hudsonville</a> and an eastern end in <a href="Lowell%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Lowell Township</a>. The consultants were asked to study a full <a href="freeway">freeway</a> and a <a href="limited%20access">limited access</a> <a href="boulevard">boulevard</a> design. One final option was a "no-build" alternative; under this option, existing roads would be upgraded but no new roads would be built. The <a href="Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan">City of Grand Rapids</a> opposed the freeway while the suburbs and townships south and west of the city supported it. City officials were concerned about the impact to commercial and industrial business in Grand Rapids. Hudsonville's city manager favored the proposal as a benefit to local vegetable producers who shipped produce to Detroit or Cleveland. Other supporters, such as the <a href="Georgetown%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Georgetown Township</a> supervisor, were concerned that delays in starting the project could increase costs. State and local officials expected the freeway in January 1981 to cost between $40–100 million (equivalent to $– million in ). The road was to be started no sooner than 1990.
The boundaries for the highway corridor were determined by the consultants in April 1982, running between 60th and 84th streets, "dipping like a hammock beneath the cities of Kentwood and Wyoming". The results of the study by BKI were criticized by local planners in May 1982, who called the study "shabby and unprofessional work", and asked the state to fire the consulting firm. Local residents distributed 2,000 fliers to their neighbors in opposition to the freeway. The South Belt Local Advisory Board criticized BKI's 110-page study report as "filled with errors"; the consultants' earlier 26-page paper had been rejected by the board and MDOT as "unusable". An editorial in "<a href="The%20Grand%20Rapids%20Press">The Grand Rapids Press</a>" stated that the study did not help advance the project in the area, instead opening the proposed freeway up to new controversies. Doubts about the state's budget in 1982 to build the roadway combined with issues over the consultants and their study results.

A second citizens group, the South Belt Citizens Committee, was formed in July 1982 to gain additional public information on the project and supplement the work of the other groups, including the South Belt Local Advisory Board. BKI was fired as consultant on the project by MDOT on September 9, 1982. The switch to a new consultant delayed further study because of the timetable to take bids and interview the candidates. In the interim, work was shifted to local and state planners until a new consultant could be retained in an effort to minimize the delays involved. These local projects were focused on updating the information and maps from BKI's study and refining the scope of the highway's corridor.

Gaines, Cascade, and Caledonia townships and the city of Kentwood circulated a survey amongst their communities' planning commissions and elected boards in 1982. The survey showed an inconclusive preference for a limited-access highway in what was termed a "gut level reaction" to the proposed roadway. The South Belt Citizens Committee actively started to oppose the roadway during the fall of 1982, pressing local candidates for political office to take positions on the project. The group called the roadway a "holocaust" in its mailings to the candidates. Future Lieutenant Governor <a href="Dick%20Posthumus">Dick Posthumus</a>, then a member of the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Senate">Michigan State Senate</a>, called for an end to the studies in 1983; he would later reverse and become one of the project's biggest supporters.

MDOT hired a new consultant, Schimpeler/Coradino Associates, in 1984 to study the proposed freeway. The consultant recommended the freeway in March 1985. The South Beltline was included in the ten-year highway plan in 1986. By 1989, the state wanted to set the route in 1991 with construction starting in 1993. The freeway was studied as a possible <a href="toll%20road">toll road</a> in June 1991 after three alternative routes were proposed the previous year. That September, the final route was set with a projected start date in 1997. The toll road concept was revived in September 1995 to offset the failure of a proposed gas tax increase. As a cost-saving measure, the number of interchanges was reduced to four from eight in June 1996. When a gas tax increase was passed in 1997, Governor <a href="John%20Engler">John Engler</a> promised at least seven access points for the freeway. The South Beltline was touted as "[cutting] travel time around Grand Rapids virtually in half".

Proposals for the South Beltline Freeway were nearly 25 years old by the time initial construction was started in 1997. The <a href="Michigan%20State%20Legislature">Michigan State Legislature</a> named the South Beltline around the same time for the Congressman <a href="Paul%20B.%20Henry">Paul B. Henry</a>, who died in office in 1993, serving in <a href="Gerald%20Ford">Gerald Ford</a>'s old US House seat. The cost of the construction of new roads like the South Beltline was a campaign issue when Engler ran for re-election against <a href="Geoffrey%20Feiger">Geoffrey Feiger</a> in 1998. The entire freeway was projected to open by 2008, with the first phase opening in 2002. MDOT gave the South Beltline its numerical designation on the July 1999 edition of the state map, marking M-6 for the first time as a dotted line, to denote it was "under construction". The legislature approved Engler's "Build Michigan III" program in 2000; the plan accelerated road projects in the state. The capital outlay for the year was $82 million (equivalent to $ in ). <a href="Eminent%20domain">Condemnation</a> proceedings were initiated in the <a href="Kent%20County%2C%20Michigan">Kent County</a> Circuit Court in 1999 to clear the way for the acquisitions. Land that contained homes, farms, trailer parks, and businesses was purchased by MDOT to acquire the right-of-way needed for the freeway. The land needed measured wide and long. Land acquisitions for the South Beltline Freeway were completed in July 2001. Construction started later in the fall of 2001 on the second and third phases of the project.

The first leg of the South Beltline Freeway, located between <a href="M-37%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-37</a> (Broadmoor Avenue) and <a href="Interstate%2096">I-96</a>, was finished six months early. Dry summer weather allowed the roadbed contractors to finish their portion of the section of the freeway early, earning them a $300,000 bonus (equivalent to $ in ). The overpasses for the remaining sections of the freeway were completed while the first phase was under construction, leaving the interchanges at US 131 and I-196 and the connecting roadbed to be completed at that time. The first section was paved in <a href="asphalt">asphalt</a> after MDOT reversed the decision to pave the whole freeway in <a href="concrete">concrete</a>. That stretch of freeway opened to traffic on November 20, 2001. The state kept the overall project in an accelerated status headed into the next phases in 2002.

Construction of the remaining phases between US 131 and M-37 and between I-196 and US 131 was started on April 1, 2002. Area roads that crossed the path of the new freeway were closed to traffic with posted detours so that work could begin on the roadbed for the freeway. The last major project for the freeway was to replace bridge beams in the overpasses from westbound I-196 to eastbound M-6. Design flaws were found in 2002 in the size of the beams in the bridges over eastbound I-196 and the ramp from westbound M-6 to westbound I-196. The replacement was originally supposed to close traffic along I-196 over a weekend in 2004, but kept a lane closed for a full week, backing up traffic on the Interstate for ; completion of the work was delayed when human error caused a shortage of nuts and bolts.
MDOT hosted an open house along the unopened section of M-6 between Kalamazoo and Byron Center avenues. This event took place on October 2, 2004, and was billed as the "Southbelt Shuffle", allowing the public to walk or bike along the freeway. The event was planned to draw attention to the M-6 Trail that runs parallel to the freeway. Some event participants brought their horses for the chance to ride on the freeway. The whole freeway was opened to traffic on November 17, 2004, after a ribbon cutting ceremony. When opened, reconstruction work was still being completed on overpass bridges at the I-196 interchange on the west end. The entire project cost $700 million (equivalent to $ in ) to complete over the five-year construction period, about $35 million/mi (approximately $22 million/km, equivalent to $/mi or $/km in ). When the freeway was opened, it was the first in the state of Michigan to use a <a href="single-point%20urban%20interchange">SPUI</a> located at the Kalamazoo Avenue exit. All of the bridges and sound barrier walls were painted sienna beige as part of a "color theme" to the freeway. MDOT also used a new technique to recess the pavement markings into the concrete, designed to reduce the likelihood that snowplows would scrape them off. The signs are in miles, but "the entire M-6 freeway was designed and constructed in metric", according to MDOT manager Suzette Peplinski. The final ramps opened to traffic on December 9, 2004.

MDOT added the completed M-6 to the state maps in an updated printing in June 2005. At the time, the various online mapping services still did not show a complete freeway in eastern Ottawa or southern Kent counties. Services such as <a href="Mapquest">Mapquest</a> and <a href="Yahoo%21%20Maps">Yahoo! Maps</a> rely on <a href="Tele%20Atlas">Tele Atlas</a> out of New Hampshire for their mapping information, which, in turn, relies on agencies like MDOT to update their data. MDOT's map update came out nearly eight months after the initial opening due to its inclusion in a large-scale update to the state highway map.

A year after the freeway opened, traffic volumes along parallel roads like 44th, 56th and 68th streets dropped 40–50%. At the same time, roads with interchanges along the freeway saw increased traffic. Wilson Avenue experienced a 120% increase and sections of Byron Center Avenue jumped 100% in traffic levels a month after M-6 opened. Property values in the townships surrounding the freeway increased 11.3–12.4% by 2006 as a result of development attached to the freeway. Local officials credited the freeway for increased access to the area, driving housing starts as residents flocked to the communities for their schools and quality of life. In 2007, the Metro Health Village, a commercial development centered around the Byron Center Avenue exit and the hospital opened. Described as being similar to a mall with the hospital as a tenant, the village features restaurants, shops, offices and a hotel. Metro Health relocated from Grand Rapids to the location in Wyoming in the face of opposition to planned expansions of their previous location. Since opening, even though the freeway was officially named for Paul Henry, the original South Beltline name is still in use.

Reactions to the new freeway were not all positive. In a special editorial in "The Grand Rapids Press" after the freeway opened in 2004, local resident Curt MacDougall summarized the criticisms of the new freeway. He cited the loss of rural farmland and wetlands as a negative effect of the highway. The editorial also discussed that the freeway does decrease travel times for some residents, but it will mean increased development. That development will mean further <a href="urban%20sprawl">urban sprawl</a>, and could spur the creation of additional highways in the area.

The <a href="M-6%20Trail">M-6 Trail</a> was constructed in a $3.5 million project (equivalent to $ in ) that started in 2008. The goal was to create a path linking the <a href="Kent%20Trails">Kent Trails</a> with the <a href="Paul%20Henry%20Rail%20Trail">Paul Henry Rail Trail</a>. The M-6 Trail was the brainchild of Gaines Township Supervisor Don Hilton, Sr. He had pushed to have the path included in the original freeway construction and opened with the rest of the South Beltline. The trail project was funded by $2.9 million (equivalent to $ in ) in federal grants and $300,000 (equivalent to $ in ) from the <a href="Fred%20Meijer%20%28businessman%29">Frederik and Lena Meijer Foundation</a>. The balance came from Kent County and the townships. Work on the trail was completed in November 2008.

In 2009, the asphalt section of M-6 had to be repaired. This section of roadway between East Paris Avenue and 48th Street was rated poorly by the Michigan Infrastructure and Transportation Association, while the concrete west of Broadmoor Avenue had favorable marks. MDOT budgeted $2 million in repairs on top of previous crack-related fixes that were handled by the original pavement contractor under a warranty in 2006. The local press described the stretch of road as "troublesome" in relation to pavement quality issues.

Legislation was signed by Governor <a href="Rick%20Snyder">Rick Snyder</a> on December 27, 2014, to name the section of M-6 between Byron Center and Kalamazoo avenues the David John Warsen Memorial Highway. Warsen, a <a href="United%20States%20Navy%20SEALs">US Navy SEAL</a>, was killed in a helicopter accident in <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> in 2012. This section of the highway was dedicated on August 15, 2015.

Pride and Prejudice (1995 TV series)

Pride and Prejudice is a six-episode 1995 British television drama, adapted by <a href="Andrew%20Davies%20%28writer%29">Andrew Davies</a> from <a href="Jane%20Austen">Jane Austen</a>'s <a href="Pride%20and%20Prejudice">1813 novel of the same name</a>. <a href="Jennifer%20Ehle">Jennifer Ehle</a> and <a href="Colin%20Firth">Colin Firth</a> starred as <a href="Elizabeth%20Bennet">Elizabeth Bennet</a> and <a href="Mr.%20Darcy">Mr. Darcy</a>. Produced by <a href="Sue%20Birtwistle">Sue Birtwistle</a> and directed by <a href="Simon%20Langton%20%28television%20director%29">Simon Langton</a>, the serial was a <a href="BBC">BBC</a> production with additional funding from the American <a href="A%26amp%3BE%20Network">A&E Network</a>. <a href="BBC%20One">BBC1</a> originally broadcast the 55-minute episodes from 24 September to 29 October 1995. The A&E Network aired the series in double episodes on three consecutive nights beginning 14 January 1996.

Critically acclaimed and a popular success, "Pride and Prejudice" was honoured with several awards, including a <a href="BAFTA%20Television%20Award">BAFTA Television Award</a> for Jennifer Ehle for "Best Actress" and an <a href="Emmy">Emmy</a> for "Outstanding Individual Achievement in Costume Design for a Miniseries or a Special". The role of Mr Darcy elevated Colin Firth to stardom. A scene showing Firth in a wet shirt was recognised as "one of the most unforgettable moments in British TV history". "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" called the adaptation "a witty mix of love stories and social conniving, cleverly wrapped in the ambitions and illusions of a provincial gentry". The series inspired author <a href="Helen%20Fielding">Helen Fielding</a> to write the popular "<a href="Bridget%20Jones">Bridget Jones</a>" novels and their screen adaptations subsequently featured Firth as Bridget's love interest Mark Darcy.

Episode 1: Mr. Charles Bingley, a rich man from the north of England, settles down at Netherfield estate near Meryton village in <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a> for the autumn. Mrs Bennet, unlike her husband, is excited at the prospect of marrying off one of her five daughters (Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty, and Lydia) to the newcomer. Bingley takes an immediate liking to Jane at a local country-dance, while his best friend Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy, rumoured to be twice as rich, refuses to dance with anyone including Elizabeth. Elizabeth's poor impression of his character is confirmed at a later gathering at Lucas Lodge, and she and Darcy verbally clash on the two nights she spends at Netherfield caring for the sick Jane, who fell ill after riding in the rain.

Episode 2: Mr. William Collins, a sycophantic dimwitted clergyman, visits his cousins, the Bennets. He is the <a href="Fee%20tail">entailed</a> heir of their home and estate, Longbourn, and intends to marry one of Mr. Bennet's daughters. This is meant, on his part, as an act of benign goodwill towards the Bennets, because Mrs. Bennet and her unwed daughters will be rendered homeless once Mr. Bennet dies and Mr. Collins inherits the estate. He therefore invites himself for a two-week visit, to get to know the Bennets better and select a wife from among the daughters of the family. However, the Bennet girls judge Mr. Collins to be a rather ridiculous man, an "oddity" with many peculiarities of speech and deportment. They are nevertheless civil to him, and take him to balls and social events in Meryton. One day, while on a walk around Meryton village, they meet members of a newly arrived militia, including a Mr George Wickham. At a social event, Wickham befriends Elizabeth and tells her that his father was the steward for Darcy's late father, and that he originally planned to join the clergy. He says that when Darcy has denied Wickham a living (a <a href="curacy">curacy</a>), which had been assured to him by Mr. Darcy's father. At another social event, Darcy surprises Elizabeth with a dance offer at a ball at Netherfield, which she grudgingly but politely accepts. Mr Collins proposes to Elizabeth the next day, but she resoundingly rejects him. While Mrs Bennet disagrees about Elizabeth's decision, her close friend Charlotte Lucas invites Mr Collins to stay at Lucas Lodge.

Episode 3: Elizabeth is stunned and appalled when she learns that Charlotte Lucas has accepted a proposal from Mr Collins. When the Netherfield party departs for <a href="London">London</a> in autumn, Jane stays with her modest London relatives, the Gardiners, but she soon notices that the Bingleys ignore her. After befriending Mr Wickham, Elizabeth departs for the Collinses' home in <a href="Kent">Kent</a> in the spring. They live near Rosings, the estate of the formidable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and as Lady Catherine is Darcy's aunt, Elizabeth meets Darcy several times. Shortly after Elizabeth learns of Darcy's direct responsibility for Jane and Bingley's separation, Darcy unexpectedly proposes to her, expressing his ardent admiration and love despite Elizabeth's inferior family connections. Elizabeth flatly rejects him, noting his arrogant, disagreeable, and proud character, and his involvement in her sister's failed romance and Mr Wickham's misfortune.

Episode 4: Darcy justifies his previous actions in a long letter to Elizabeth: he misjudged Jane's affection for Bingley and exposes Wickham as a gambler who once attempted to elope with his young sister, Georgiana, to obtain her inheritance. Back at Longbourn, Mr Bennet allows Lydia to accompany the militia to <a href="Brighton">Brighton</a> as a personal friend of the militia colonel's wife. Elizabeth joins the Gardiners on a sightseeing trip to <a href="Derbyshire">Derbyshire</a> and visits <a href="Pemberley">Pemberley</a>, Darcy's estate, during his absence. Greatly impressed by the immense scale and richness of the estate, Elizabeth listens to the housekeeper's earnest tales of her master's lifelong goodness, while Darcy refreshes from his unannounced journey home by taking a swim in a lake. After an unexpected and awkward encounter with Elizabeth, a damp Darcy is able to prevent the party's premature departure with an unusual degree of friendliness and politeness.

Episode 5: Elizabeth and the Gardiners receive an invitation to Pemberley, where Darcy and Elizabeth share significant glances. The next morning, Elizabeth receives two letters from Jane, discussing Lydia's elopement with Wickham. As Elizabeth is about to return to Longbourn, Darcy walks in and offers his help, but, upon digesting the bad news, gradually appears more remote, and soon takes his leave. Elizabeth supposes she will never see him again. Mr and Mrs Bennet try to deal with the possible scandal until they receive a letter from Mr Gardiner, saying that Lydia and Wickham have been found and are not married, but will be soon under the Gardiners' care. After Mr Bennet states his surprise at how easily the issue has been resolved, Elizabeth informs Jane about her last meeting with Darcy, including her ambivalent feelings for him.

Episode 6: After Lydia carelessly mentions Darcy's involvement in her wedding, Mrs Gardiner enlightens Elizabeth how Darcy found the errant couple and paid for all the expenses. When Bingley and Darcy return to Netherfield in the autumn, Darcy apologises to Bingley for intervening in his relationship with Jane and gives his blessing for the couple to wed. Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who has heard rumours of an engagement between Darcy and Elizabeth but wants him to marry her sickly daughter Anne, pays Elizabeth an unannounced visit. She insists that Elizabeth renounce Darcy, but Elizabeth does not rule out a future engagement. When Elizabeth thanks Darcy for his role in Lydia's marriage, Lady Catherine's story encourages Darcy to reconfirm his feelings for Elizabeth. Elizabeth admits the complete transformation of her feelings and agrees to an engagement, which takes her family by surprise. The series ends with a double wedding in the winter months: Jane with Bingley, and Elizabeth to Fitzwilliam Darcy.

When <a href="Casting%20%28performing%20arts%29">casting</a> the many characters of "Pride and Prejudice", the producer <a href="Sue%20Birtwistle">Sue Birtwistle</a> and director <a href="Simon%20Langton%20%28television%20director%29">Simon Langton</a> were looking for actors with wit, charm and charisma, who could play the <a href="British%20Regency">Regency</a> period. Their choices for the protagonists, 20-year-old <a href="Elizabeth%20Bennet">Elizabeth Bennet</a> and 28-year-old <a href="Mr%20Darcy">Mr Darcy</a>, determined the other actors cast. Hundreds of actresses between 15 and 28 auditioned, and those with the right presence were <a href="screen%20test">screen-tested</a>, performing several prepared scenes in period costumes and makeup in a television studio. Straight offers were made to several established actors.

<a href="Jennifer%20Ehle">Jennifer Ehle</a> was chosen from six serious candidates to play Elizabeth, the second Bennet daughter, the brightest girl, and her father's favourite. At the time in her mid-20s, Ehle had read "Pride and Prejudice" at the age of 12 and was the only actor to be present throughout the whole filming schedule. Sue Birtwistle particularly wanted <a href="Colin%20Firth">Colin Firth</a>, a relatively unknown British actor in his mid-30s at the time, to play the wealthy and aloof Mr. Darcy. Birtwistle had worked with him on the mid-1980s comedy film "<a href="Dutch%20Girls">Dutch Girls</a>", but he repeatedly turned down her offer as he neither felt attracted to Austen's feminine perspective nor believed himself to be right for the role. Birtwistle's persistent coaxing and his deeper looks into the Darcy character finally convinced him to accept the role. Firth and Ehle began a romantic relationship during the filming of the series, which received media attention only after the couple's separation.

<a href="Benjamin%20Whitrow">Benjamin Whitrow</a> was cast to play Mr Bennet, Elizabeth's distinguished but financially imprudent and occasionally indulgent <a href="gentry">gentry</a> father. <a href="BAFTA">BAFTA</a>-nominated <a href="Alison%20Steadman">Alison Steadman</a> was cast to play the <a href="parvenu">parvenu</a> Mrs Bennet, Elizabeth's mortifyingly affected social climbing mother. Steadman was offered the role without auditions or screen tests. Elizabeth's four sisters, whose ages ranged between 15 and 22, were cast to look dissimilar from each other. <a href="Susannah%20Harker">Susannah Harker</a> portrayed Elizabeth's beautiful older sister Jane, who desires to only see good in others. <a href="Lucy%20Briers">Lucy Briers</a>, <a href="Polly%20Maberly">Polly Maberly</a>, and <a href="Julia%20Sawalha">Julia Sawalha</a> played Elizabeth's younger sisters – the plain Mary, the good-natured but flighty and susceptible Kitty, and frivolous and headstrong Lydia. Being 10 years older than 15-year-old Lydia, Julia Sawalha, of "<a href="Absolutely%20Fabulous">Absolutely Fabulous</a>" fame, had enough acting experience to get the role without screen tests. <a href="Joanna%20David">Joanna David</a> and <a href="Tim%20Wylton">Tim Wylton</a> appeared as the Gardiners, Elizabeth's maternal aunt and uncle. <a href="David%20Bamber">David Bamber</a> played the unctuous clergyman, Mr Collins, a cousin of Mr Bennet. <a href="Lucy%20Scott">Lucy Scott</a> portrayed Elizabeth's best friend and Mr Collins's wife, Charlotte Lucas, and <a href="David%20Bark-Jones">David Bark-Jones</a> portrayed Lt. Denny.

The producers found <a href="Crispin%20Bonham-Carter">Crispin Bonham-Carter</a> to have the best physical contrast to Firth's Darcy and gave him his first major television role as the good-natured and wealthy Mr Charles Bingley. Bonham-Carter had originally auditioned for the part of Mr <a href="George%20Wickham">George Wickham</a>, a handsome militia lieutenant whose charm conceals his licentiousness and greed, but <a href="Adrian%20Lukis">Adrian Lukis</a> was cast instead. <a href="Anna%20Chancellor">Anna Chancellor</a>, of "<a href="Four%20Weddings%20and%20a%20Funeral">Four Weddings and a Funeral</a>" fame, played Mr Bingley's sister Caroline Bingley. (Chancellor is also Jane Austen's six-times-great-niece) Mr Bingley's other sister and his brother-in-law were played by <a href="Lucy%20Robinson%20%28actress%29">Lucy Robinson</a> (Louisa Hurst) and <a href="Rupert%20Vansittart">Rupert Vansittart</a> (Mr Hurst). Casting the role of Darcy's young sister, Georgiana, proved hard as the producers were looking for a young actress who appeared innocent, proud and yet shy, had class and could also play the piano. After auditioning over 70 actresses, Simon Langton suggested <a href="Emilia%20Fox">Emilia Fox</a>, the real-life daughter of Joanna David (Mrs Gardiner), for the part. <a href="Barbara%20Leigh-Hunt">Barbara Leigh-Hunt</a> was cast as Darcy's meddling aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, without auditions or screen tests.

<a href="Jane%20Austen">Jane Austen</a>'s novel "<a href="Pride%20and%20Prejudice">Pride and Prejudice</a>" had already been the subject of <a href="Jane%20Austen%20in%20popular%20culture%23Pride%20and%20Prejudice">numerous television and film adaptations</a>, including <a href="BBC">BBC</a> television versions in 1938, 1952, 1958, 1967 and 1980. In the autumn of 1986, after watching a preview of Austen's "<a href="Northanger%20Abbey">Northanger Abbey</a>", <a href="Sue%20Birtwistle">Sue Birtwistle</a> and <a href="Andrew%20Davies%20%28writer%29">Andrew Davies</a> agreed to adapt "Pride and Prejudice", one of their favourite books, for television. Birtwistle in particular felt that a new adaptation on <a href="film%20stock">film</a> would serve the drama better than the previous <a href="videotape">videotape</a>d "Pride and Prejudice" television adaptations, which looked too "undernourished" and "unpoetic". The needs of TV scheduling forced Davies to change his original plan of a five-episode adaptation to six. Birtwistle and Davies then offered the first three scripts to <a href="ITV%20Network">ITV</a> in late 1986 to build on the guaranteed BBC audience, but the recent TV adaptation led to a delay. When ITV announced its renewed interest in 1993, <a href="Michael%20Wearing">Michael Wearing</a> of the BBC commissioned the final scripts with co-funding from the American <a href="A%26amp%3BE%20Network">A&E Network</a>. Director <a href="Simon%20Langton%20%28television%20director%29">Simon Langton</a> and the art department joined pre-production in January and February 1994.
Although Birtwistle and Davies wished to remain true to the tone and spirit of the novel, they wanted to produce "a fresh, lively story about real people", not an "old studio-bound BBC drama that was shown in the Sunday teatime slot". Emphasising sex and money as the themes of the story, Davies shifted the focus from Elizabeth to Elizabeth and Darcy and foreshadowed Darcy's role in the narrative resolution. To portray the characters as real human beings, Davies added short backstage scenes such as the Bennet girls dressing up to advertise themselves in the marriage market. New scenes where men pursue their hobbies with their peers departed from Jane Austen's focus on women. The biggest technical difficulty proved to be adapting the long letters in the second half of the story. Davies employed techniques such as <a href="voice-over">voice-over</a>s, <a href="Flashback%20%28narrative%29">flashback</a>s, and having the characters read the letters to themselves and to each other. Davies added some dialogue to clarify events from the novel to a modern audience but left much of the novel's dialogue intact.

Director of photography John Kenway used <a href="16%20mm%20film%23Super%2016%20mm">Super 16mm</a> film, which has a slightly smaller widescreen <a href="Aspect%20ratio%20%28image%29">aspect ratio</a> than , but the series was originally broadcast <a href="pan%20and%20scan">pan and scan</a>.

The budget of about £1 million per episode (totalling US$9.6 million) allowed 20 shooting weeks of five days to film six 55-minute episodes. Production aimed for 10.5-hour shooting days plus time for costume and make-up. Two weeks before filming began, about 70 of the cast and crew gathered for the script read-through, followed by rehearsals, lessons for dancing, horse-riding, fencing, and other skills that needed to be ready ahead of the actual filming. Filming took place between June 1994 and 1 November 1994 to reflect the changing seasons in the plot, followed by post-production until mid-May 1995. Scenes in the same place were grouped in the filming schedule.

Twenty-four locations, most of them owned by the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">National Trust</a>, and eight studio sets were used for filming. Reflecting the wealth differences between the main characters, the filming location for Longbourn showed the comfortable family house of the Bennet family, whereas Darcy's <a href="Pemberley">Pemberley</a> needed to look like the "most beautiful place", showing good taste and the history of the aristocracy. 

The first location that the producers agreed on was <a href="Lacock">Lacock</a> in <a href="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a> to represent the village of Meryton. <a href="Luckington">Luckington</a> Court nearby served as the interior and exterior of Longbourn. <a href="Lyme%20Hall">Lyme Hall</a> in <a href="Cheshire">Cheshire</a> was chosen as Pemberley but management problems forced production to film Pemberley's interiors at <a href="Sudbury%20Hall">Sudbury Hall</a> in <a href="Sudbury%2C%20Derbyshire">Sudbury, Derbyshire</a>.

The producers found <a href="Belton%20House">Belton House</a> in <a href="Grantham%2C%20Lincolnshire">Grantham, Lincolnshire</a> the best match for Rosings, Lady Catherine de Bourgh's estate, which needed to appear "over-the-top" to reflect her disagreeableness. Old Rectory at <a href="Teigh">Teigh</a> in <a href="Rutland">Rutland</a> was chosen as Hunsford parsonage, Mr Collins's modest home. <a href="Edgcote%23Edgcote%20House">Edgcote House</a> in south-west <a href="Northamptonshire">Northamptonshire</a> served as the interior and exterior of Bingley's Netherfield, along with <a href="Brocket%20Hall">Brocket Hall</a> in <a href="Welwyn%20Garden%20City%2C%20Hertfordshire">Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire</a> as the Netherfield ballroom. The <a href="London">London</a> streets were filmed in <a href="Lord%20Leycester%20Hospital">Lord Leycester Hospital</a> in <a href="Warwick%2C%20Warwickshire">Warwick, Warwickshire</a>. Wickham's and Georgiana's planned elopement in <a href="Ramsgate">Ramsgate</a> was filmed in the English seaside resort <a href="Weston-super-Mare">Weston-super-Mare</a> in <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>. Wickham's wedding takes place in <a href="St%20Paul%27s%2C%20Deptford">St Paul's in Deptford, London</a>.

Because "Pride and Prejudice" was a period drama, the design required more research than contemporary films. The personality and wealth of the characters were reflected in their costumes; the wealthy Bingley sisters were never shown in print dresses and they wore big feathers in their hair. As the BBC's stock of early 19th century costumes was limited, costume designer Dinah Collin designed most of the costumes, visiting museums for inspiration while trying to make the clothes attractive to a modern audience (although some costumes, mostly worn by extras, were re-used from earlier BBC productions or hired). Elizabeth's clothes had earthy tones and were fitted to allow easy and natural movements in line with the character's activity and liveliness. In contrast, Collin chose pale or creamy white colours for the clothes of the other Bennet girls to highlight their innocence and simplicity and richer colours for Bingley's sisters and Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Colin Firth participated in the wardrobe decisions and wanted his character to wear darker colours, leaving the warmer colours for Bingley.

The producers imagined Darcy to be dark despite no such references in the novel and asked Firth to dye black his light-brown hair, eyebrows and lashes; they instructed all male actors to let their hair grow before filming and shave off their moustaches. Three brunette wigs were made to cover Ehle's short, blonde hair and one wig for Alison Steadman (Mrs. Bennet) because of her thick, heavy hair. Susannah Harker's (Jane) hair was slightly lightened to contrast with Elizabeth's and was arranged in a classic Greek style to highlight the character's beauty. Mary's plainness was achieved by painting spots on Lucy Briers's face; her hair was greased to suggest an unwashed appearance and was arranged to emphasise the actress's protruding ears. As Kitty and Lydia were too young and wild to have their hair done by the maids, the actresses' hair was not changed much. Makeup artist Caroline Noble had always considered Mr. Collins a sweaty character with a moist upper lip; she also greased David Bamber's hair and gave him a low parting to suggest baldness.

<a href="Carl%20Davis">Carl Davis</a> had been writing scores for BBC adaptations of classic novels since the mid-1970s and approached Sue Birtwistle during pre-production. Aiming to communicate the wit and vitality of the novel and its theme of marriage and love in a small town in the early 19th century, he used contemporary classical music as inspiration, in particular a popular <a href="Beethoven">Beethoven</a> <a href="septet">septet</a> of the period, as well as a theme strongly reminiscent of the finale of Beethoven's Emperor Concerto. For control over the sound, the music was recorded in six hours by a group of up to 18 musicians and was then fed into tiny earpieces of the screen musicians, who mimed playing the instruments. The actresses whose characters played the piano, Lucy Briers (Mary) and Emilia Fox (Georgiana), were already accomplished pianists and were given the opportunity to practise weeks ahead of filming. Among the songs and movements that were played in the serial were <a href="Handel">Handel</a>'s "Air con Variazioni" from Suite No. 5 in E Major HWV 430 and "<a href="Ombra%20mai%20f%C3%B9">Slumber, Dear Maid</a>" from his opera "<a href="Xerxes%20%28opera%29">Xerxes</a>", <a href="Mozart">Mozart</a>'s "<a href="Rondo%20Alla%20Turca">Rondo Alla Turca</a>", "<a href="Voi%20Che%20Sapete">Voi Che Sapete</a>" and other music from his operas "<a href="The%20Marriage%20of%20Figaro">The Marriage of Figaro</a>" and "<a href="Don%20Giovanni">Don Giovanni</a>", Beethoven's "<a href="Andante%20Favori">Andante Favori</a>", the second movement from <a href="Muzio%20Clementi">Muzio Clementi</a>'s Sonatina No.4 and the traditional folk song "<a href="The%20Barley%20Mow">The Barley Mow</a>". A soundtrack with Davis's themes was released on CD in 1995.

Many scenes in the book were set at dances or balls. Jane Gibson based her choreography on "The Apted Book of Country Dances" (1966) by W.S. Porter, which had several late-18th-century dances by Charles and Samuel Thompson such as "The Shrewsbury Lasses", "A Trip to Highgate" and "Mr. Beveridge's Maggot". Although these dances gave the story an impression of authenticity, they were anachronistic, being out of fashion by the time of the story. Some fifteen dances were choreographed and rehearsed before filming. Polly Maberly and Julia Sawalha, the dance-mad Kitty and Lydia, had three days to learn the dances. Three days were allotted for the filming of the ball at Netherfield, whose pace and style concentrated on elegance rather than the community enjoying themselves as at the dance at Meryton. The musicians and dancers had earpieces with music playing to allow dialogue recording. Many wide-shots of Elizabeth's and Darcy's dance at Netherfield later turned out to be unusable because of a hair in front of a lens so the editors resorted to <a href="close-up">close-up</a> shots and material provided by a <a href="steadicam">steadicam</a>.

The adaptation received praise for its faithfulness to the novel, which highlights the importance of environment and upbringing on peoples' development, although privilege is not necessarily advantageous. Describing the adaptation as "a witty mix of love stories and social conniving, cleverly wrapped in the ambitions and illusions of a provincial gentry", critics noted that Davies's focus on sex and money and Austen's wry, incisive humour and the "deft" characterisation, prevented the television adaptation from "descending into the realm of a nicely-costumed, brilliantly-photographed melodrama".
To avoid a narrator, the serial delegates the novel's first ironic sentence to Elizabeth in an early scene. The adaptation opens with a view of Darcy's and Bingley's horses as they race across a field toward the Netherfield estate, expressing vitality; Elizabeth watches them before breaking into a run. While the novel indicates Elizabeth's independence and energy in her three-mile trek to Netherfield, the adaptation of this scene also shows her rebelliousness and love of nature.

In what is "perhaps the most radical revision of Austen's text", the BBC drama departs from a late 18th-century vision of emotional restraint and portrays emotions in a "modern" interpretation of the story. The novel leaves Elizabeth and the reader uncertain of Darcy's emotions and the adaptation uses additional scenes to hint at Darcy's inability to physically contain or verbally express his emotional turmoil. On the other hand, whereas the climax of the novel describes Darcy expressing his ardent love for Elizabeth at length (though Austen leaves his actual words to the reader's imagination), the adaptation elides this moment and passes directly to the next lines of dialogue. Scholars argue that activities such as billiards, bathing, fencing and swimming (see <a href="%23Lake%20scene">the lake scene</a>) offer Darcy to a female gaze; he is often presented in profile by a window or a fireplace when his friends discuss Elizabeth. Many passages relating to appearance or characters' viewpoints were lifted from the novel.

The novel shows irony with "unmistakable strains of cynicism, ... laughing at human nature without any real hope of changing it". Laughter in the story, which ranges from irresponsible laughter to laughter at people and laughter of amusement and relief, can also be linked to the sexual tensions among the different characters. Despite their appeal to modern audiences, laughter and wit were seen as vulgar and irreverent in Austen's time. The BBC drama made changes "with a view to exposing a character, or adding humour or irony to a situation". The adaptation comically exaggerates the characters of Mrs. Bennet, Miss Bingley and Mr. Collins, even showing Mrs. Bennet on the verge of hysteria in many of the early scenes.

The serial expands on Austen's metaphorical use of landscapes, reinforcing beauty and authenticity. Elizabeth takes every opportunity to enjoy nature and to escape exposure to Mr. Collins and Lady Catherine. The most symbolic use of nature in the novel is Elizabeth and the Gardiners' visit to Pemberley in Derbyshire, where Elizabeth becomes conscious of her love for Darcy. The story makes nature integral in the form of Old England. Elizabeth's appreciation of the beauties of Derbyshire elevates Darcy in her and her relatives' opinion. Darcy's gaze through the window works as a movie screen, projecting Elizabeth's actions for him and the viewer. His participation in the English landscape is his redemption.

Between 10 and 11 million people watched the original six-episode broadcast on <a href="BBC%20One">BBC One</a> on Sunday evenings from 24 September to 29 October 1995. The episodes were repeated each week on <a href="BBC%20Two">BBC Two</a>. The final episode of "Pride and Prejudice" had a market share of about 40 percent in Britain, by which time eight foreign countries had bought the rights to the serial. 3.7 million Americans watched the first broadcast on the <a href="A%26amp%3BE%20Network">A&E Network</a>, which aired the serial in double episodes on three consecutive evenings beginning 14 January 1996.

The serial was released on <a href="VHS">VHS</a> in the UK in the week running up to the original transmission of the final episode. The entire first run of 12,000 copies of the double-video set sold out within two hours of release. 70,000 copies had been sold by the end of the first week of sales, increasing to 200,000 sold units within the first year of the original airing. A BBC spokeswoman called the initial sale results "a huge phenomenon", as "it is unheard of for a video to sell even half as well, especially when viewers are able to tape the episodes at home for free". The CD soundtrack was also popular, and 20,000 copies of an official <a href="making-of">making-of</a> book were sold within days. The serial was released on DVD four times, initially in 2000, as a digitally remastered "Tenth Anniversary Edition" in September 2005, and in April 2007 as part of a "Classic Drama DVD" magazine collection. A high-definition transfer was produced from the original negatives and released as a <a href="Blu-ray">Blu-ray</a> in October 2008. The HD version has not been broadcast on television; the BBC refuses to broadcast anything shot in 16mm in HD. The same restored version was released on DVD in March 2009. The Blu-ray was released on 14 April 2009.

A 2010 Remastered Edition and a 2014 Keepsake Edition have the same footage, time lengths, and format. The 2014 Keepsake Edition has improved colors. The 2010 Remastered Edition begins with piracy warnings and then movie begins playing. The 2014 Keepsake Edition begins with five compulsory previews which can only be bypassed by skipping forward through each individual preview. The second disc of the Keepsake set also begins with the same five compulsory previews. The 2014 Keepsake Edition has 50" of new bonus materials plus the 1'45" of bonus materials that was presented in the 2010 Remastered Edition. These bonus materials include interviews with the producer, screenwriter, director, musical composer, and cast members. The cast interviews in both editions do not include interviews with the two main characters, Colin Firth (Mr. Darcy) and Jennifer Ehle (Elizabeth Bennet). 

The critical response to "Pride and Prejudice" was overwhelmingly positive. Gerard Gilbert of "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" recommended the opening episode of the serial one day before the British premiere, saying the television adaptation is "probably as good as it [can get for a literary classic]. The casting in particular deserves a tilt at a <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts">BAFTA</a>, Firth not being in the slightest bit soft and fluffy – and Jennifer Ehle showing the right brand of spirited intelligence as Elizabeth." He considered Benjamin Whitrow a "real scene-stealer with his Mr. Bennet", but was undecided about Alison Steadman's portrayal of Mrs. Bennet. Reviewing the first episode for the same newspaper on the day after transmission, <a href="Jim%20White%20%28journalist%29">Jim White</a> praised Andrew Davies for "injecting into the proceedings a pace and energy which at last provides a visual setting to do justice to the wit of the book. With everyone slinging themselves about at high speed (the dances, in a first for the genre, actually involve a bit of sweat), it looks like people are doing something you would never have suspected they did in Austen's time: having fun."

A few days before the American premiere, <a href="Howard%20Rosenberg">Howard Rosenberg</a> of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" considered the adaptation "decidedly agreeable" despite its incidental liberties with Austen's novel, and named Elizabeth's parents and Mr. Collins as the main source of humour. John O'Connor of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" lauded the serial as a "splendid adaptation, with a remarkably faithful and sensitively nuanced script". He commented on Jennifer Ehle's ability to make Elizabeth "strikingly intelligent and authoritative without being overbearing", and noted how Firth "brilliantly captures Mr. Darcy's snobbish pride while conveying, largely through intense stares, that he is falling in love despite himself". O'Connor praised Barbara Leigh-Hunt's portrayal of Lady Catherine as "a marvellously imperious witch" and considered her scenes with David Bamber (Mr. Collins) "hilarious".

However, O'Connor remarked that American audiences might find the "languorous walks across meadows" and "ornately choreographed dances" of the British production too slow. In one of the most negative reviews, "<a href="People%20Magazine">People Magazine</a>" considered the adaptation "a good deal more thorough than necessary" and "not the best Austen on the suddenly crowded market". Although the reviewer thought Firth "magnificent", he rebuked the casting of Jennifer Ehle as her oval face made her "look like <a href="Ana%C3%AFs%20Nin">Anaïs Nin</a> in period clothes, and that ain't right". The official <a href="A%26amp%3BE%20Network">A&E Network</a> magazine summarised a year later that "critics praised the lavish production, audiences adored it, and women everywhere swooned over Darcy. So much, in fact, that newspapers began to joke about 'Darcy fever.'" Commendation for the serial continued in the years following its original transmission.

"Pride and Prejudice" received <a href="BAFTA%20Television%20Award">BAFTA Television Award</a> nominations for "Best Drama Serial", "Best Costume Design", and "Best Make Up/Hair" in 1996. Jennifer Ehle was honoured with a BAFTA for "Best Actress", while Colin Firth and Benjamin Whitrow, nominated for "<a href="British%20Academy%20Television%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Best Actor</a>", lost to <a href="Robbie%20Coltrane">Robbie Coltrane</a> of <a href="Cracker%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">"Cracker"</a>. Firth won the 1996 <a href="Broadcasting%20Press%20Guild">Broadcasting Press Guild</a> Award for "Best Actor", complemented by the same award for "Best Drama Series/Serial". The serial was recognised in the United States with an <a href="Emmy">Emmy</a> for "Outstanding Individual Achievement in Costume Design for a Miniseries or a Special", and was Emmy-nominated for its achievements as an "Outstanding Miniseries" as well as for choreography and writing. Among other awards and nominations, "Pride and Prejudice" received a <a href="Peabody%20Award">Peabody Award</a>, a <a href="Television%20Critics%20Association%20Award">Television Critics Association Award</a>, and a <a href="Golden%20Satellite%20Award">Golden Satellite Award</a> nomination for outstanding achievements as a serial.

As one of the BBC's and A&E's most popular presentations ever, the serial was "a cultural phenomenon, inspiring hundreds of newspaper articles and making the novel a commuter favourite". With the 1995 and 1996 films "<a href="Persuasion%20%281995%20film%29">Persuasion</a>", "<a href="Sense%20and%20Sensibility%20%28film%29">Sense and Sensibility</a>" and "<a href="Emma%20%281996%20theatrical%20film%29">Emma</a>", the serial was part of a wave of Jane Austen enthusiasm which caused the membership of the <a href="Jane%20Austen%20Society">Jane Austen Society</a> of North America to jump fifty percent in 1996 and to over 4,000 members in the autumn of 1997. Some newspapers like "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>" explained this "Austen-mania" as a commercial move of the television and film industry, whereas others attributed Austen's popularity to escapism.

While Jennifer Ehle refused to capitalise on the success of the serial and joined the <a href="Royal%20Shakespeare%20Company">Royal Shakespeare Company</a> at <a href="Stratford-upon-Avon">Stratford-upon-Avon</a>, the role of Mr. Darcy unexpectedly elevated <a href="Colin%20Firth">Colin Firth</a> to stardom. Although Firth did not mind being recognised as "a romantic idol as a Darcy with smouldering sex appeal" in a role that "officially turned him into a heart-throb", he expressed the wish to not be associated with "Pride and Prejudice" forever and was reluctant to accept similar roles. He took on diverse roles and co-starred in productions such as "<a href="The%20English%20Patient%20%28film%29">The English Patient</a>" (1996), "<a href="Shakespeare%20in%20Love">Shakespeare in Love</a>" (1998), "<a href="Bridget%20Jones%27s%20Diary%20%28film%29">Bridget Jones's Diary</a>" (2001 – although this film is essentially an adaptation of Pride and Prejudice in which Firth effectively reprises the role of Darcy), "<a href="Girl%20with%20a%20Pearl%20Earring%20%28film%29">Girl with a Pearl Earring</a>" (2003), "<a href="Love%20Actually">Love Actually</a>" (2003) and "" (2004).

"Pride and Prejudice" continued to be honoured years later. A 2000 poll of industry professionals conducted by the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a> ranked the serial at 99 in the <a href="100%20Greatest%20British%20Television%20Programmes">100 Greatest British Television Programmes</a> of the 20th century, which the BFI attributed to its "managing to combine faithfulness to the novel with a freshness that appealed across the generations". "<a href="Radio%20Times">Radio Times</a>" included the serial in their list of "40 greatest TV programmes ever made" in 2003. It was also named by "Entertainment Weekly" as one of the 20 best miniseries of all time. In 2007, the <a href="UK%20Film%20Council">UK Film Council</a> declared "Pride and Prejudice" one of the television dramas that have become "virtual brochures" for British history and society. <a href="Lyme%20Hall">Lyme Hall</a>, <a href="Cheshire">Cheshire</a>, which had served as the exterior of <a href="Pemberley">Pemberley</a>, experienced a tripling in its visitor numbers after the series' broadcast and is still a popular travel destination.

The adaptation is famous for a scene in its fourth episode where a fully dressed Darcy, having emerged from a swim in a lake at Pemberley, accidentally encounters Elizabeth. While many critics attributed the scene's appeal to Firth's sexual attractiveness, Andrew Davies thought that it unwittingly "rerobed, not disrobed, Austen". When Davies wrote the scene (it was not part of Austen's novel), he did not intend a sexual connection between Elizabeth and Darcy but to create "an amusing moment in which Darcy tries to maintain his dignity while improperly dressed and sopping wet". The BBC opposed Davies's plan to have Darcy naked but the producers discarded the alternative of using underpants as fatuous. According to Davies, Firth had "a bit of the usual tension about getting [his] kit off", the scene was filmed with Firth in linen shirt, breeches and boots. A stuntman, who appears in midair in a very brief shot, was hired because of the risk of infection with <a href="Weil%27s%20disease">Weil's disease</a> at <a href="Lyme%20Park">Lyme Park</a>. A short underwater segment was filmed separately with Firth in a tank at <a href="Ealing%20Studios">Ealing Studios</a> in west <a href="London">London</a>.

"<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" declared the lake scene "one of the most unforgettable moments in British TV history". The sequence also appeared in <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a>'s <a href="100%20Greatest%20/%20100%20Worst">Top 100 TV Moments</a> in 1999, between the controversial programme "<a href="Death%20on%20the%20Rock">Death on the Rock</a>" and the <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a>. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" compared the scene to <a href="Marlon%20Brando">Marlon Brando</a> shouting "<a href="Stella%20Kowalski">Stella!</a>" in his undershirt in "<a href="A%20Streetcar%20Named%20Desire%20%281951%20film%29">A Streetcar Named Desire</a>" and Firth's projects began alluding to it – screenwriter-director <a href="Richard%20Curtis">Richard Curtis</a> added <a href="in-joke">in-joke</a> moments of Firth's characters falling into the water to "Love Actually" and "Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason", and Firth's character from the 2007 film "<a href="St%20Trinian%27s%20%282007%20film%29">St Trinian's</a>" emerges from a fountain in a soaking wet shirt before meeting up with an old love. The creators of the 2008 ITV production "<a href="Lost%20in%20Austen">Lost in Austen</a>" emulated the lake scene in their "Pride and Prejudice" through their contemporary heroine who cajoles Darcy into recreating the moment.

Cheryl L. Nixon suggested in "Jane Austen in Hollywood" that Darcy's dive is a "revelation of his emotional capabilities", expressing a "<a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a> bond with nature, a celebration of his home where he can 'strip down' to his essential self, a cleansing of social prejudices from his mind, or ... a rebirth of his love for Elizabeth". Linda Troost and Sayre Greenfield wrote that the scene "tells us more about our current decade's obsession with physical perfection and acceptance of gratuitous nudity than it does about Austen's Darcy, but the image carves a new facet into the text".

The fictional journalist <a href="Bridget%20Jones">Bridget Jones</a> (in reality <a href="Helen%20Fielding">Helen Fielding</a> of "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>") wrote of her love of the serial in the paper's "<a href="Bridget%20Jones%27s%20Diary">Bridget Jones's Diary</a>" column during the original British broadcast, mentioning her "simple human need for Darcy to get off with Elizabeth" and regarding the couple as her "chosen representatives in the field of shagging, or rather courtship". Fielding loosely reworked the plot of "Pride And Prejudice" in her 1996 novel of the column, naming Bridget's uptight love interest "Mark Darcy" and describing him exactly like Colin Firth. Following a first meeting with Firth during his filming of "<a href="Fever%20Pitch%20%281997%20film%29">Fever Pitch</a>" in 1996, Fielding asked Firth to collaborate in what would become a multi-page interview between Bridget Jones and Firth in her 1999 sequel novel, "". Conducting the real interview with Firth in <a href="Rome">Rome</a>, Fielding lapsed into Bridget Jones mode and obsessed over Darcy in his wet shirt for the fictional interview. Firth participated in the editing of what critics called "one of the funniest sequences in the diary's sequel". Both novels make various other references to the BBC serial.

Andrew Davies collaborated on the screenplays for the 2001 and 2004 "Bridget Jones" films, in which <a href="Crispin%20Bonham-Carter">Crispin Bonham-Carter</a> (Mr. Bingley) and <a href="Lucy%20Robinson%20%28actress%29">Lucy Robinson</a> (Mrs. Hurst) appeared in minor roles. The self-referential in-joke between the projects convinced Colin Firth to accept the role of Mark Darcy, as it gave him an opportunity to ridicule and liberate himself from his "Pride and Prejudice" character. Film critic <a href="James%20Berardinelli">James Berardinelli</a> would later state that Firth "plays this part [of Mark Darcy] exactly as he played the earlier role, making it evident that the two Darcys are essentially the same". The producers never found a way to incorporate the Jones-Firth interview in the second film but shot a spoof interview with Firth as himself and <a href="Ren%C3%A9e%20Zellweger">Renée Zellweger</a> staying in character as Bridget Jones after a day's wrap. The scene, which extended Bridget's Darcy obsession to cover Firth's lake scene in "Love Actually", is available as a bonus feature on the DVD.

For almost a decade, the 1995 TV serial was considered "so dominant, so universally adored, [that] it has lingered in the public consciousness as a cinematic standard". Comparing six "Pride and Prejudice" adaptations in 2005, the "<a href="Daily%20Mirror">Daily Mirror</a>" gave 9/10 to the 1995 serial ("what may be the ultimate adaptation") and the <a href="Pride%20%26amp%3B%20Prejudice%20%282005%20film%29">2005 film adaptation</a>, leaving the other adaptations such as the <a href="Pride%20and%20Prejudice%20%281940%20film%29">1940 film</a> behind with six or fewer points. The 2005 film was "obviously [not as] daring or revisionist" as the 1995 adaptation but the youth of the film's leads, <a href="Keira%20Knightley">Keira Knightley</a> and <a href="Matthew%20Macfadyen">Matthew Macfadyen</a>, was mentioned favourably over the 1995 cast, as Jennifer Ehle had formerly been "a little too 'heavy' for the role". The president of the Jane Austen Society of North America noted in an otherwise positive review that the casting of the 2005 leads was "arguably a little more callow than Firth and Ehle" and that "Knightley is better looking than Lizzy should strictly be". The critical reception of MacFadyen's Darcy, whose casting had proven difficult because "Colin Firth cast a very long shadow", ranged from praise to pleasant surprise and dislike. Several critics did not observe any significant impact of Macfadyen's Darcy in the following years. Garth Pearce of "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>" noted in 2007 that "Colin Firth will forever be remembered as the perfect Mr. Darcy", and Gene Seymour stated in a 2008 "<a href="Newsday">Newsday</a>" article that Firth was "'universally acknowledged' as the definitive Mr. Darcy".

Gateshead International Stadium

Gateshead International Stadium (GIS) is a <a href="multi-purpose%20stadium">multi-purpose</a>, <a href="all-seater">all-seater</a> venue in <a href="Gateshead">Gateshead</a>, Tyne and Wear, England. Originally known as the Gateshead Youth Stadium, the venue was built in 1955 at a cost of £30,000. It has since been extensively re-developed on three occasions. Its capacity of around 11,800 is the greatest in the <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Gateshead">Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead</a>, the third-largest in Tyne and Wear (behind only <a href="St%20James%27%20Park">St James' Park</a> and the <a href="Stadium%20of%20Light">Stadium of Light</a>) and the sixth-largest in <a href="North%20East%20England">North East England</a>.

The main arena is principally used for athletics. The inaugural athletics competition at the redeveloped venue, the 1974 "Gateshead Games", was instigated by <a href="Brendan%20Foster">Brendan Foster</a>, a Gateshead Council employee at that time. By breaking the world record in the <a href="3000%20metres">men's 3,000 m</a>, Foster brought international publicity to the new stadium and began a tradition of athletics competitions at the venue, which has since hosted the <a href="British%20Grand%20Prix%20%28athletics%29">British Grand Prix</a> (2003–10) and the <a href="European%20Team%20Championships">European Team Championships</a> in 1989, 2000 and 2013. It is the only venue to have hosted the latter event three times. Five world records have been set at the stadium, including two by <a href="pole%20vault">pole vault</a>er <a href="Yelena%20Isinbayeva">Yelena Isinbayeva</a> and a tied <a href="100%20metres">100 metres</a> record by <a href="Asafa%20Powell">Asafa Powell</a> in 2006.

Although the venue primarily caters for athletics, it is the current or former home to teams in several sports. It has been used by the town's main football club since 1973. Gateshead International Stadium was home to the <a href="Gateshead%20Thunder%20%281999%29">Gateshead Thunder</a> <a href="rugby%20league">rugby league</a> club during their spell in the <a href="Super%20League">Super League</a> and the replacement <a href="Newcastle%20Thunder">Gateshead Thunder club</a> played home games in the main arena, which was known as the Thunderdome when used by that team until the club relocated to Newcastle in 2015. Gateshead Harriers Athletic Club, which includes Foster and <a href="Jonathan%20Edwards%20%28triple%20jumper%29">Jonathan Edwards</a> among its life members, are the oldest tenants, having used the site since 1956. The stadium has also been used as a concert venue by numerous musical artists including <a href="Little%20Mix">Little Mix</a>, <a href="Guns%20N%27%20Roses">Guns N' Roses</a>, <a href="Bon%20Jovi">Bon Jovi</a>, <a href="Bryan%20Adams">Bryan Adams</a> and <a href="Tina%20Turner">Tina Turner</a>.

The stadium is built on the site of two large chemical works opened in 1827 and 1834. These works initially thrived, but by the early part of the 20th century both were in terminal decline, and were demolished in 1932 to leave behind a 2-million-tonne heap of spoil. This land, approximately east of the centre of Gateshead, was cleared in 1942 but continued to lie derelict until the mid-1950s.

In early 1955, Gateshead Council began work on transforming this land. The Gateshead Youth Stadium, built on the site of the old chemical works, was opened by <a href="Jim%20Peters%20%28athlete%29">Jim Peters</a> on 27 August 1955. Costing £30,000, the original venue contained little more than a cinder running track and an asphalt cycling track, though floodlights and a seating area were added soon after. On 1 July 1961, the arena hosted its first major competition—the <a href="Vaux%20Breweries">Vaux Breweries</a> International Athletics Meet—but according to sportswriter John Gibson, the Youth Stadium remained "little more than a minor track with a tiny grandstand and open terraces".

According to author Thomas Telfer, by the turn of the 1970s, the town of Gateshead was suffering from "the classic symptoms of decay in its inner-city areas". The response during the 1960s had been a programme of systematic derelict land reclamation and environmental improvement. While these measures did not have an immediate positive impact on the perception of the town, Gateshead Council pressed ahead by looking to develop existing infrastructure with a view to overall regeneration. One such opportunity was identified at the Gateshead Youth Stadium, where the council believed that investment might raise the region's profile and bring international recognition. In April 1974, Gateshead Council inaugurated a "Sport and Recreation" department. In July 1974, the council appointed <a href="Brendan%20Foster">Brendan Foster</a>—a former schoolteacher turned athlete and a native of <a href="Tyne%20and%20Wear">Tyne and Wear</a>—as the Council's sport and recreation manager. Foster, who according to Gibson became "the father of Gateshead athletics", had been forced to train in <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> during 1973 as a result of the poor condition of the Youth Stadium track. In December 1973, he had been invited to a civic reception to celebrate his breaking of the two-mile world record earlier that year at Crystal Palace. At this reception, Foster was told that a new <a href="all-weather%20running%20track">synthetic track</a> was being laid at Gateshead Youth Stadium. His response was a promise that, if the Council was serious, he would run at the stadium and break a world record (Foster later offered an explanation of that promise: "You know how it is when you've had a few drinks—you promise the world!"). When the track was laid in early 1974, Foster became convinced of the Council's sincerity. He was interviewed for the managerial position and, upon appointment, became the "driving force" behind the programme of improvements to the Youth Stadium, which included the building of the main, covered Tyne and Wear stand in 1981 and three accompanying stands; the venue was renamed the Gateshead International Stadium. This first tranche of improvements cost around £8 million, and Foster's proposal to commemorate the re-opening with an athletic event was approved, allowing for the first "Gateshead Games" to be held in 1974.

The success of the first Gateshead Games, and their subsequent annual renewal, raised the profile of the stadium and caused Gateshead Council to further their financial investment. During the 1980s, additions were made to the site infrastructure, including the building of an indoor sports hall, outdoor football pitches and a gymnasium. In 1989 the running track was again relayed and Gateshead confirmed its reputation as a top-class athletics venue by hosting the <a href="European%20Cup%20%28athletics%29">Europa Cup</a> (forerunner to the <a href="European%20Team%20Championships">European Team Championships</a>). In the 21st century, the site has been the subject of two major re-development projects. The first was completed in 2006, when two artificial outdoor football pitches, indoor athletic training facilities, sports science provisions and conferencing rooms were added at a cost of £15 million. The revamped stadium, funded by collaboration between <a href="One%20NorthEast">One NorthEast</a>, <a href="Sport%20England">Sport England</a> and <a href="Gateshead%20College">Gateshead College</a> among others, was opened on 12 May 2006 by <a href="Sebastian%20Coe">Sebastian Coe</a>.

A second tranche of development, undertaken in two stages, was approved in November 2009. This included a general refurbishment and improvement of the existing facilities at the stadium, adding cover, better toilet and new refreshment facilities to the exposed East Stand, improving wheelchair access, adding extra catering and conferencing facilities and a new media and management centre. This was funded by collaboration between Gateshead Council, local development funds and Gateshead College. The covering of the 4,000-seat East Stand with a new canopy roof was completed in July 2010, immediately prior to Gateshead hosting a <a href="2010%20IAAF%20Diamond%20League">Diamond League</a> event. The second stage of the re-development—the building of the corporate and media facilities—commenced on 6 September 2010 and was completed on time in summer 2011. The total cost of the work was estimated to be £7.6 million.

A third programme of expansion was initially mooted in 2008. The aim of this programme was to expand the stadium into an all-embracing "sports village", replete with an ice rink, indoor golf course, restaurants and shops. Gateshead Council invited tenders in August 2008 from commercial organisations interested in undertaking the development. A formal draft development brief was compiled and published in November 2009. A report to Council in December 2009 noted that there had been "a reasonable level of interest at the preliminary stage" from private investors, but that only one detailed proposal had been submitted, which had been declined by the Council on financial grounds. The report also noted concerns that the original centrepiece of the proposed village, the ice rink, may have been deterring investors and that a similar proposal to redevelop land at the <a href="Stadium%20of%20Light">Stadium of Light</a> in <a href="Sunderland%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear">Sunderland</a> was detracting from what councillors had hoped to be a unique feature of the proposed village. The result was that a fresh proposal was raised to remove the ice rink from the brief in an attempt to "stimulate the market". A public consultation was undertaken and in May 2010 the council reported that 327 of the 375 responses received were in favour of the amended proposal. As a result, notice was given to developers that the council intended to market the site and ten responses were received.

Gateshead International Stadium and its facilities occupy of land. The main athletics arena at Gateshead International Stadium is an <a href="All-seater%20stadium">all-seater</a>, bowl-shaped arena consisting of four stands of seats. The precise capacity of the venue is uncertain; some sources claim it to be 11,750, others 11,762 and some provide a figure of 11,800. The main stand is the Tyne and Wear Stand, a steep, <a href="cantilever">cantilever</a>ed structure seating 3,300 spectators. This stand contains toilet and catering facilities and a bar area. Opposite is the East Stand, a 4,000-seat structure that was uncovered until 2010, when a cantilevered <a href="Canopy%20%28building%29">canopy</a> roof was added. A bespoke design by Fabric Architecture, the roof is a structure incorporating five <a href="barrel%20vault">barrel vault</a> forms. Part of the same improvement plan added toilet and catering facilities to the East Stand. The South Terrace, sometimes referred to as simply the South Stand, consists of a continuous, uncovered bank of seating in eight blocks with access through four <a href="turnstiles">turnstiles</a>. The North Terrace is opposite and consists of two blocks of uncovered seating separated by a large scoreboard.

The athletics track in the main arena was laid in 2003 and is an <a href="International%20Association%20of%20Athletics%20Federations">International Association of Athletics Federations</a> (IAAF) standard 400m eight-lane oval. It is a polymer synthetic <a href="tartan%20track">tartan track</a> with a depth of . The sprint straight consists of eight lanes and is situated in front of the Tyne and Wear Stand, adjacent to the <a href="long%20jump">long</a> and <a href="triple%20jump">triple jump</a> area. A height-adjustable water jump, for use in <a href="Steeplechase%20%28athletics%29">steeplechase racing</a>, is located on the inside of the track. <a href="Floodlights%20%28sport%29">Floodlights</a> allow athletics events to be held at night. The inner track area, which is floodlit, is an IAAF standard-sized grass surface used for athletics field events, rugby and football. When used for the latter, the pitch dimensions are .

The main arena is supplemented by other facilities. To the rear of the North Terrace are two <a href="Artificial%20turf">third generation artificial</a> pitches that are <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> licensed, fully floodlit and full-sized for use in competitive rugby, football and American football. Alongside them are two grassed and one sand-dressed playing areas, which are also floodlit. Behind the Tyne and Wear Stand is an indoor sports hall, which contains a playing area marked out for various sports including badminton, netball and tennis. A retractable indoor athletics facility was previously housed alongside the sports hall, consisting of a long synthetic sprint straight and areas for throwing and jumping events, but its mechanical operation proved problematic and a more modern structure replaced it in 2006. This facility has a sprint straight in an hall, throwing and jumping facilities, a weights room and gymnasium.

The first major athletic event held at the stadium was the Vaux Breweries International Athletics meet in July 1961. According to its sponsors, the highlight of this meet was the team three-mile race, won by the Blackpool and Fylde Athletic club who were awarded a gold tankard as their prize. Attracted by a prize fund of £500 and the imminent <a href="AAA%20Championships">AAA Championships</a> in London, the event attracted several athletes from New Zealand, including <a href="Athletics%20at%20the%201960%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%205000%20metres">reigning 5000m metre Olympic champion</a> <a href="Murray%20Halberg">Murray Halberg</a> and <a href="Peter%20Snell">Peter Snell</a>, the <a href="Athletics%20at%20the%201960%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20800%20metres">reigning 800m Olympic champion</a>. Watched by a capacity crowd of 10,000 spectators, the men won their respective races; Halberg placed first in the <a href="Mile%20run">mile</a> with a time of 4:03:70 and Snell led a <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> one-two in the 880-yard event, finishing ahead of teammate Gary Philpott in 1:50:40.

When the comprehensive refurbishment of the stadium was completed more than a decade later, Brendan Foster (by this time a Gateshead Council employee) proposed an international athletics meet. On 3 August 1974, the first "Gateshead Games" were staged in front of around 10,000 spectators. Four weeks before he won the European 5000m title at the <a href="1974%20European%20Athletics%20Championships">1974 European Athletics Championships</a> in Rome, Foster kept his earlier promise to run in the men's 3000m and won the race in a new world-record time of 7:35:20. According to journalist John Gibson, Foster's performance gave the meet, broadcast live by <a href="Tyne%20Tees%20Television">Tyne Tees Television</a>, "landmark status". A plaque commemorating the record was later placed at the entrance to the stadium.

The Gateshead Games became an annual event, which gave the stadium credibility as a major sporting venue. In his managerial capacity with Gateshead Council, Foster was increasingly able to attract athletes to the games. In 1977, Foster had to intervene when <a href="BBC%20Radio%20Newcastle">BBC Radio Newcastle</a> provided the wrong <a href="Ethiopian%20national%20anthem">Ethiopian national anthem</a> which, when played, offended <a href="Miruts%20Yifter">Miruts Yifter</a> sufficiently that he and his teammates started off towards <a href="Newcastle%20International%20Airport">Newcastle International Airport</a>. The intervention worked—in the end, Foster asked Yifter and his teammates if they would sing the anthem themselves, which they did in the middle of the stadium—and Yifter returned to outclass a field including <a href="Steve%20Ovett">Steve Ovett</a> over 5000m. The track was resurfaced by Regisport in 1982 and the venues' profile was further raised in the summer of 1983, when Gateshead-born athlete <a href="Steve%20Cram">Steve Cram</a> faced Sebastian Coe over 800m in the Gateshead Games. In front of a reported crowd of 15,000 who were "shoehorned into the bowl" and millions more watching on BBC's <a href="Sunday%20Grandstand">Sunday Grandstand</a>, Cram prevailed to spark "pandemonium" in his final race before winning the gold medal at the <a href="1983%20World%20Championships%20in%20Athletics">1983 World Athletics Championships</a> in Helsinki.

In 1989, Gateshead hosted the <a href="1989%20European%20Cup%20%28athletics%29">Europa Cup</a>. The men's competition was won for the first time by a Great Britain team captained by <a href="Linford%20Christie">Linford Christie</a> and which included <a href="Kriss%20Akabusi">Kriss Akabusi</a> and <a href="Jack%20Buckner">Jack Buckner</a>; the event was described a decade later as having had an "invigorating effect" on those who were in attendance. Four years later, on 30 July 1993, a stadium-record crowd of 14,797 watched Christie, by this time <a href="Athletics%20at%20the%201992%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20100%20metres">the reigning 100m Olympic champion</a>, in action again – this time against his old rival <a href="Carl%20Lewis">Carl Lewis</a> in a race where both men were reportedly paid £100,000 irrespective of the result. Christie won in a time of 10.07 seconds, ahead of <a href="Jon%20Drummond">Jon Drummond</a> in second and Lewis, who finished "a distant third". The 100m race was the highlight of the "high profile" Vauxhall Invitational meet, which was televised in the UK by <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20channel%29">ITV</a> and watched by around 10 million viewers. <a href="Michael%20Johnson%20%28sprinter%29">Michael Johnson</a>, <a href="John%20Regis%20%28athlete%29">John Regis</a> and Steve Cram competed in various events at the Vauxhall Invitational.

In August 1998, Gateshead was selected to host the <a href="2000%20European%20Cup%20%28athletics%29">2000 Europa Cup</a> after the <a href="European%20Athletic%20Association">European Athletic Association</a> switched the event from original host venue <a href="Martinique">Martinique</a> to avoid athletes travelling long distances in an Olympic year. This made Gateshead the first venue to host the event twice. On 16–17 July 2000, spectators at Gateshead once again saw Great Britain's men's team take the title, this time by half a point from Germany in second place; the British victory came despite missing ten first-choice team members. The women's event was won by Russia, who defeated second-placed Germany by thirteen points.

Foster's "Gateshead Games" had become the <a href="British%20Grand%20Prix%20%28athletics%29">British Grand Prix</a> by 2003, and on 13 July 21-year-old <a href="Yelena%20Isinbayeva">Yelena Isinbayeva</a> set a <a href="Women%27s%20pole%20vault%20world%20record%20progression">new world record</a> of 4.82m in the women's <a href="pole%20vault">pole vault</a> event. Isinbayeva's achievement in the last event of the meet was so unexpected that only 1,000 of the 10,000 spectators witnessed it, the rest having left early. For her achievement, she was given a bonus cheque for $50,000. On 27 June 2004, Isinbayeva returned to Gateshead. This time the event organisers decided to schedule the pole vault event earlier and were rewarded when Isinbayeva defied extremely windy conditions to post a new record mark of 4.87m. Isinbayeva was the second woman to set a world record in the pole vault at Gateshead; <a href="Daniela%20Bartova">Daniela Bartova</a> did so in 1995. In 2006, a crowd of 8,500 saw <a href="Asafa%20Powell">Asafa Powell</a> equal the world record of 9.77 seconds in the <a href="100%20metres">men's 100m</a>. The official, un-rounded time of 9.762 seconds was then the fastest time ever recorded. The meet was also notable for the return to competition of <a href="Dwain%20Chambers">Dwain Chambers</a> after his ban for using <a href="Tetrahydrogestrinone">performance-enhancing drugs</a>, and for <a href="Eliud%20Kipchoge">Eliud Kipchoge</a> breaking Foster's stadium record over 3000m that had stood for more than three decades.

In 2010, the British Grand Prix at Gateshead was chosen as one of the inaugural fourteen <a href="IAAF%20Diamond%20League%202010">Diamond League</a> events, but although competitors included <a href="Tyson%20Gay">Tyson Gay</a>, Powell, <a href="Jessica%20Ennis">Jessica Ennis</a> and <a href="Vincent%20Chepkok">Vincent Chepkok</a>, the attendance was unusually poor, causing the local press to wonder whether Gateshead's contract for the marquee event would be renewed. Those fears were to prove well-founded when <a href="UK%20Athletics">UK Athletics</a> agreed to a three-year contract to stage the event at the <a href="Alexander%20Stadium">Alexander Stadium</a> in Birmingham. The move prompted one reporter to lament that "the switch is a major blow to both Gateshead International Stadium and North-East sport in general, but can hardly be regarded as a major surprise given the dwindling support for major athletics events in the region."

This loss was mitigated somewhat by the European Athletic Association's decision to award Gateshead the <a href="2013%20European%20Team%20Championships">2013 European Team Championships</a>, the successor to the Europa Cup. In doing so, Gateshead became the only stadium to host the European Team Championships on three occasions. The championships were held on 22–23 June 2013 amid very wet and windy conditions. On the first day of competition, <a href="Mo%20Farah">Mo Farah</a> ran a 50.89 second final lap in winning the men's 5000m to help the home team into third place on 181 points, behind Russia (194 points) and Germany (195 points). Despite a strong start, the Great Britain team were unable to make up the deficit on the second day of competition and finished in third place overall on 338 points, behind runners-up Germany (347.5 points) and the champions Russia (354.5 points).

The stadium was briefly used by former Football League members <a href="Gateshead%20A.F.C.">Gateshead A.F.C.</a> after leaving <a href="Redheugh%20Park">Redheugh Park</a> in 1973, but the club went bust later in the year. The following year South Shields football club relocated to Gateshead and were renamed <a href="Gateshead%20United%20F.C.">Gateshead United</a>; they played at the Gateshead Stadium from 1974 to 1977 when it folded and <a href="Gateshead%20F.C.">Gateshead F.C.</a> was formed.

Gateshead F.C. have been tenants since their formation in 1977. In May 2008 Gateshead hosted <a href="Buxton%20F.C.">Buxton</a> in a promotion play-off and won 2–0 in front of 1,402 spectators, the largest crowd to watch the club at the ground in 14 years. That record was broken a year later when 4,121 saw Gateshead defeat <a href="A.F.C.%20Telford%20United">Telford United</a> 2–0 on 9 May 2009 to win promotion to the <a href="Conference%20Premier">Conference Premier</a> league. The current record attendance for a competitive fixture stands at 8,144, set on 4 May 2014 when Gateshead played host to <a href="Grimsby%20Town%20F.C.">Grimsby Town</a> in the second leg of the <a href="2013-14%20Football%20Conference%23Play-offs">Conference Premier play-off</a> semi-final. Gateshead won 3-1 to progress to the final at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a> where they were beaten 2-1 by <a href="Cambridge%20United%20F.C.">Cambridge United</a>. The defeat consigned the club to a 55th consecutive season outside the Football League. Gateshead F.C. continue to play at Gateshead Stadium but, according to North East Life magazine, it is "a fine but inappropriate stadium ... as a football ground it can be a soulless home". In 2009, chairman Graham Wood unveiled plans to move to a new, purpose-built 9,000 capacity ground on Prince Consort Road in the centre of Gateshead. Detailed proposals were published soon after, and Wood told local media in 2012 that he expects the move to increase crowds and alleviate the financial constraints on him as he continues to bankroll the club; it is estimated that crowds would need to reach 3,000 regularly for the club to operate profitably from Gateshead Stadium. According to the original proposal, the stadium was expected to be ready for the 2012–13 season, but financing has been difficult and the proposed move is now on hold.

<a href="Gateshead%20Harriers">Gateshead Harriers</a> are an athletic club based at Gateshead International Stadium. Founded in 1904 as Gateshead St Mary's Church Running Club, they were initially a men-only club until allowing the admission of women in 1951. The club moved to the Gateshead Youth Stadium in 1956, making the Harriers the stadium's oldest tenant. In 2006 they won promotion to the first division of the <a href="British%20Athletics%20League">British Athletics League</a> and were the only club from the north-east of England to compete at that level. After a six-year stay in the division, the Harriers were relegated to division two in August 2012 after failing to win enough points at the final meet of the season at Eton to prevent a bottom-two league finish. Club officials received over 100 new applications for membership in the aftermath of <a href="2012%20Olympics">the 2012 London Olympics</a>.

At least one Gateshead Harrier has taken part in every Olympics and <a href="Paralympic%20Games">Paralympics</a> held since 1972. Notable alumni include Brendan Foster, who joined the club aged 17 and later claimed that "my first aim was to be the best runner of Gateshead Harriers". Foster, inducted into the <a href="England%20Athletics%20Hall%20of%20Fame">England Athletics Hall of Fame</a> in 2010 and recently voted the eleventh "greatest <a href="Geordie">Geordie</a>" in a local poll, later became the president of Gateshead Harriers and remains so as of 2012. Current world triple-jump record holder <a href="Jonathan%20Edwards%20%28triple%20jumper%29">Jonathan Edwards</a>, another member of the England Athletics Hall of Fame, joined Gateshead Harriers in 1991. Edwards was a member of the club when he set his record mark in <a href="1995%20World%20Championships%20in%20Athletics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20triple%20jump">winning gold</a> at the <a href="1995%20World%20Championships%20in%20Athletics">1995 World Championships</a> in Helsinki, when winning <a href="Athletics%20at%20the%202000%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20triple%20jump">Olympic gold</a> at the <a href="2000%20Summer%20Olympics">2000 Sydney Games</a> and a <a href="2001%20World%20Championships%20in%20Athletics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20triple%20jump">second world title</a> a year later in <a href="Edmonton">Edmonton</a>. Both Foster and Edwards are honorary life members of the club.

In 1998, Gateshead was awarded a <a href="rugby%20league">rugby league</a> franchise after a three-way contest with Cardiff and Swansea. The result was Gateshead Thunder, who played in <a href="Super%20League%20IV">Super League IV</a> in 1999. The Thunder played at Gateshead International Stadium and the club had, according to sports journalist Andy Wilson, "an enjoyable and surprisingly successful season" which included home and away wins against <a href="St%20Helens%20R.F.C.">St. Helens</a> and a sixth-place finish in the table – missing out on the playoffs by two points. Despite these performances, which attracted an average crowd of 3,895 to Gateshead Stadium, the franchise lost £700,000 in its first year and in November 1999 the <a href="Rugby%20Football%20League">Rugby Football League</a> (RFL) approved a merger with the Hull Sharks. The result was the formation of <a href="Hull%20F.C.">Hull FC</a>, and when the authorities refused permission for the merged clubs to enter a Hull-based team into the RFL's <a href="Rugby%20Football%20League%20Championship%20Second%20Division">second tier</a>, the franchise moved almost in its entirety to Hull, ending Gateshead's Super League participation after a single season; according to Wilson, the Thunder was "left to die, provoking bitter resentment" from supporters.

According to journalist Richard Bott, since the demise of the original Thunder side the club has "struggled for their very existence." There have been some highlights, including winning <a href="Championship%201">Championship 1</a> in 2008 and a run to the quarter-final of the <a href="Challenge%20Cup">Challenge Cup</a> in 2009 which ended in a 66–6 defeat to Super League side St Helens in front of 4,325 fans at Gateshead International Stadium. However, the Thunder went through a 64-game losing streak spanning two-and-a-half years before winning against <a href="Workington%20Town">Workington Town</a> on 29 August 2012.

Relations between the Thunder and Gateshead Council were strained at times, with a possible move to <a href="Kingston%20Park%20%28stadium%29">Kingston Park</a> <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a>, first mooted, and rejected, in 2006. In 2008, the club committed itself again to Gateshead Stadium for the immediate future, however, in March 2014 <a href="The%20Journal%20%28newspaper%29">The Journal</a> reported that talks had begun between Thunder's managing director Keith Christie and representatives of <a href="Newcastle%20Falcons">Newcastle Falcons</a> with a view to the Falcons taking over the rugby league club. Falcons' owner Semore Kurdi confirmed that a bid had been made to purchase Gateshead Thunder on 20 March 2014, though he refused to elaborate on whether he intended to relocate the club if that bid was accepted. The takeover was confirmed on 23 May 2014, though it was announced that the club would continue to play at the International Stadium. In January 2015 Gateshead Thunder were officially renamed Newcastle Thunder and relocated to Kingston Park. Keith Christie told the BBC that the move was "a business decision" designed to build a new fan base for the club.

The <a href="Gateshead%20Senators">Gateshead Senators</a> (originally the Gateshead International Senators) are an <a href="American%20football">American football</a> club formed in 1988 when the Newcastle Senators, who played at Northern Rugby Club, moved across the Tyne to play at the Gateshead International Stadium. The club has had mixed fortunes but their most successful season came in 1999. Having won eight of their nine games in the regular season, the team won the Division One North title and advanced to the end-of-season playoffs. After beating the Merseyside Nighthawks 43–0 in the quarter-finals, the Senators defeated the <a href="Essex%20Spartans">Essex Spartans</a> 33–19 in the semi-finals to reach the championship final. At the <a href="Saffron%20Lane%20sports%20centre">Saffron Lane Stadium</a> in <a href="Leicester">Leicester</a>, the Senators faced the <a href="Bristol%20Aztecs%20%28American%20football%29">Bristol Aztecs</a>. In a tight encounter, the Senators claimed the Division One <a href="British%20American%20Football%20League">British American Football League</a> title with a 7–2 victory. The club reached the playoffs again in the next three seasons but were unable to replicate that success, and after a season voluntarily spent in Division Two in 2003, returned to Division One North in 2004. They continue to play in that division, and in the 2012 season failed to make the playoffs after recording five wins and five defeats in their ten games.

The Senators were a tenant at Gateshead Stadium from 1988 to 2011. In 2012, the club announced plans to move away from Gateshead for the start of the 2012 season to create "a better game-day experience" and they now play at the <a href="Monkton%20Stadium">Monkton Stadium</a>.

Gateshead International Stadium has been used for many years as a concert venue. On 31 July 1982, <a href="The%20Police">The Police</a> performed at the stadium as part of their <a href="Ghost%20in%20the%20Machine%20Tour">Ghost in the Machine Tour</a>, with <a href="U2">U2</a> as a supporting act. Reports in the local press suggested that The Police seemed disappointed that the stadium was only half full and cited high ticket prices and poor weather as possible causes. On 16 June 1992 <a href="Guns%20N%27%20Roses">Guns N' Roses</a>, supported by <a href="Soundgarden">Soundgarden</a> and <a href="Faith%20No%20More">Faith No More</a>, performed at the stadium. This time the weather was hot and sunny which helped ensure that the concert, part of the <a href="Use%20Your%20Illusion%20Tour">Use Your Illusion Tour</a>, was a sell-out. American rock group <a href="Bon%20Jovi">Bon Jovi</a> have played twice at the stadium. The first occasion was on 27 June 1995, while supported by <a href="Skin%20%28British%20band%29">Skin</a>, on their <a href="These%20Days%20Tour">These Days Tour</a>. The group returned to Gateshead on 22 August 2000 as part of their <a href="Crush%20Tour">Crush Tour</a>. Another artist who has performed multiple times at Gateshead International Stadium is <a href="Tina%20Turner">Tina Turner</a>. As part of her , Turner performed twice on consecutive nights (21–22 July 1990) and attracted a total of 60,000 spectators. Turner performed for a third time at the stadium as part of her <a href="Wildest%20Dreams%20Tour">Wildest Dreams Tour</a> on 12 July 1996. Most recently the venue played host to <a href="Little%20Mix">Little Mix</a> on 26 July 2018 as part of their <a href="Summer%20Hits%20Tour%202018">Summer Hits Tour</a>. Other artists to have played at the stadium include <a href="Bryan%20Adams">Bryan Adams</a>, <a href="Rod%20Stewart">Rod Stewart</a>, <a href="Simple%20Minds">Simple Minds</a> and <a href="Simply%20Red">Simply Red</a>.

Gateshead International Stadium is east of Gateshead Town Centre and is on the <a href="A184%20road%20%28England%29%23Triple-digit%20roads">A184 Felling Bypass</a>, with access to a car park at Neilson Road. Journey time by car from Gateshead town centre is approximately five minutes and a further five minutes travel from Newcastle upon Tyne. A footpath runs adjacent to the Felling bypass and the journey by foot from Gateshead town centre takes some fifteen minutes. A journey east to <a href="Heworth%20Interchange">Heworth Interchange</a> also takes around fifteen minutes. Two designated cycle routes run past the stadium. These are <a href="National%20Cycle%20Route%2072">Hadrian's Way</a>, which provides access from <a href="Tynemouth">Tynemouth</a> in the east and <a href="Wylam">Wylam</a> in the west, and the <a href="National%20Cycle%20Route%2014">Keelman's Way</a>, which runs along the south bank of the <a href="River%20Tyne">River Tyne</a> towards <a href="Blaydon-on-Tyne">Blaydon-on-Tyne</a>.

The stadium is well served by public transport. It has its own <a href="Tyne%20and%20Wear%20Metro">Tyne and Wear Metro</a> station, the <a href="Gateshead%20Stadium%20Metro%20station">Gateshead Stadium Metro station</a>. This is at Shelley Drive, some five minutes' walk from the ground. Trains run direct from this station to all other Metro destinations; trains to <a href="South%20Shields%20Metro%20station">South Shields</a> and <a href="South%20Hylton%20metro%20station">South Hylton</a> stop at platform one while trains travelling towards <a href="St%20James%20Metro%20station">St James</a> and <a href="Airport%20Metro%20station%20%28Tyne%20and%20Wear%29">Airport</a> stop at platform two. The Gateshead Stadium Metro station is open seven days a week and at peak times seventeen trains per hour stop there. The nearest mainline railway station is <a href="Newcastle%20railway%20station">Newcastle Central Station</a>, around away, though local rail travel calls at Heworth Interchange. <a href="Go%20North%20East">Go North East</a> operate the 93/4 "Loop" bus service, which provides access to the stadium from the <a href="Team%20Valley">Team Valley</a>, <a href="Gateshead%20Interchange">Gateshead Interchange</a>, Heworth Interchange and <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20Hospital%2C%20Gateshead">Queen Elizabeth Hospital</a> in <a href="Sheriff%20Hill">Sheriff Hill</a>. This bus runs every fifteen minutes during the day and every half-hour during evenings.

State Route 52 (SR 52) is a <a href="List%20of%20state%20highways%20in%20California">state highway</a> in <a href="San%20Diego%20County%2C%20California">San Diego County, California</a>, that extends from La Jolla Parkway at <a href="Interstate%205%20in%20California">Interstate 5</a> (I-5) in <a href="La%20Jolla">La Jolla</a>, <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a>, to <a href="California%20State%20Route%2067">SR 67</a> in <a href="Santee%2C%20California">Santee</a>. It is a <a href="freeway">freeway</a> for its entire length and serves as a major east–west route through the northern part of the city of San Diego. The road connects the major north–south freeways of the county, including I-5, <a href="Interstate%20805">I-805</a>, <a href="California%20State%20Route%20163">SR 163</a>, <a href="Interstate%2015%20in%20California">I-15</a>, <a href="California%20State%20Route%20125">SR 125</a>, and SR 67. SR 52 passes north of the <a href="Rose%20Canyon%20Fault">Rose Canyon Fault</a> before traversing <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Air%20Station%20Miramar">Marine Corps Air Station Miramar</a> (MCAS Miramar). East of Santo Road and west of SR 125, the highway goes through <a href="Mission%20Trails%20Regional%20Park">Mission Trails Regional Park</a>, a large open preserve. SR 52 is also known as the Soledad Freeway and the San Clemente Canyon Freeway.

Plans for a route between La Jolla and Santee date from 1959, and SR 52 was officially designated in the <a href="1964%20state%20highway%20renumbering%20%28California%29">1964 state highway renumbering</a>. Construction began in 1966 at the I-5 interchange with Ardath Road leading to La Jolla. It continued with the building of San Clemente Canyon Road, which was later widened to become SR 52. The freeway was completed east to I-805 in 1970, and was built in two stages from there to Santo Road east of I-15; the last phase was completed in 1988.

The freeway east of Santo Road encountered delays from environmentalists over the endangered <a href="least%20Bell%27s%20vireo">least Bell's vireo</a>, a songbird which faced habitat destruction, as well as those concerned with the destruction of homes and businesses for the freeway <a href="right-of-way%20%28transportation%29">right-of-way</a>. The extension to Mission Gorge Road opened in 1993, and SR 52 was completed to SR 125 in 1998. Funding issues delayed the completion of the entire route until 2011, more than fifty years after construction began; until then, the city of Santee faced traffic snarls. A widening project was completed in 2007 between Santo Road and Mast Boulevard; further expansion has been put on hold due to state budget concerns.

SR 52 begins just west of <a href="I-5%20%28CA%29">I-5</a> at the eastern end of La Jolla Parkway. Before entering <a href="San%20Clemente%20Canyon">San Clemente Canyon</a>, the road becomes a freeway as it intersects I-5. The canyon is part of Marian Bear Natural Park. The freeway runs north of the <a href="Rose%20Canyon%20Fault">Rose Canyon Fault</a>, composed of <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> rock estimated to be 90 million years old, and <a href="Mount%20Soledad">Mount Soledad</a>. Following exits with Clairemont Mesa Boulevard / Regents Road and Genesee Avenue, SR 52 intersects <a href="I-805%20%28CA%29">I-805</a> before exiting the canyon and traveling along the southern edge of the <a href="MCAS%20Miramar">MCAS Miramar</a> military base.

From I-805 to SR 163, the highway goes through an area with visible <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a> sedimentary rocks estimated to be 10 million years old. After passing the Miramar Recycling Center and an interchange with Convoy Street, SR 52 intersects <a href="SR%20163%20%28CA%29">SR 163</a>, a freeway heading towards downtown San Diego. SR 52 intersects Kearny Villa Road before an interchange with <a href="I-15%20%28CA%29">I-15</a>. A <a href="collector-distributor%20road">collector-distributor road</a> serves these three interchanges.

After this interchange, the freeway leaves the edge of the military base and enters the San Diego neighborhood of <a href="Tierrasanta%2C%20San%20Diego%2C%20California">Tierrasanta</a>, where there is a junction with Santo Road, before traversing <a href="Mission%20Trails%20Regional%20Park">Mission Trails Regional Park</a>, an open space preserve, for a few miles. The freeway ascends to Mission Trails Pass, north of the summit of Fortuna Mountain. The mountain is part of the <a href="Peninsular%20Range">Peninsular Range</a>; the highway cuts through <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> rocks estimated to be 50 million years old and marine <a href="fossils">fossils</a>. The road on the eastern side of the mountain is carved out of "igneous granitic rocks" that are thought to be 150 million years old, an unusual formation compared to the Eocene layer.

A dedicated two-way bicycle path exists on the northern side of the roadway between Santo Road and Mast Boulevard, with access possible from both terminii. East of the Mast Boulevard interchange, SR 52 crosses and begins to parallel the <a href="San%20Diego%20River">San Diego River</a>. The freeway enters the city of <a href="Santee%2C%20California">Santee</a>, where SR 52 was built alongside Mission Gorge Road. SR 52 intersects the northern end of <a href="SR%20125%20%28CA%29">SR 125</a>, where SR 52 traffic can exit south onto SR 125. The freeway continues east through Santee, with interchanges at Fanita Drive, Cuyamaca Street, and Magnolia Avenue, before it comes to an end at <a href="California%20State%20Route%2067">SR 67</a>.

SR 52 is part of the <a href="California%20Freeway%20and%20Expressway%20System">California Freeway and Expressway System</a> and is eligible for the <a href="State%20Scenic%20Highway%20System%20%28California%29">State Scenic Highway System</a>; however, it is not a scenic highway as designated by <a href="Caltrans">Caltrans</a>. SR 52 is not part of the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a>, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a>. The entire route is known as both the Soledad Freeway and the San Clemente Canyon Freeway. In 2013, SR 52 had an <a href="annual%20average%20daily%20traffic">annual average daily traffic</a> (AADT) of 69,000 at the eastern terminus with SR 67, and 103,000 between Convoy Street and SR 163, the lowest and the highest AADT for the highway, respectively.

In 1959, Legislative Route 279 was designated as a highway from La Jolla to Santee and incorporated into the California Freeway and Expressway System. In the <a href="1964%20state%20highway%20renumbering%20%28California%29">1964 state highway renumbering</a>, this became SR 52. However, SR 52 took more than fifty years to be constructed, due to delays in the planning and construction phases.

A public hearing on Legislative Route 279 and on the Ardath Road connection to La Jolla was held on November 15, 1961. At the hearing, there were concerns expressed regarding destruction of vegetation. City and state officials indicated that the Soledad Freeway would be constructed in the northern part of the canyon to minimize environmental damage. On November 9, 1966, the I-5 interchange with Ardath Road opened at the western end of what would become SR 52. The original goal was to connect the interchange with San Clemente Canyon Road, which served as a predecessor to SR 52; plans were to widen the road to four lanes and designate it as SR 52. The connecting ramps were not opened that day because the aluminum <a href="guard%20rail">guard rail</a>s had not been delivered on time. Estimates indicated that each resident of La Jolla would save 80 hours per year by using Ardath Road. A ramp from southbound I-5 to westbound Ardath Road was never completed because of a hairpin turn that would be necessary due to the towering cliff on the west side of I-5 that Ardath Road ascends as it continues to La Jolla. On November 18, San Clemente Canyon Road was connected to I-5 when the aluminum guard rails arrived and were subsequently installed. San Clemente Canyon Road was not fully opened until 1967. That year, citizens expressed opposition to the construction of the Soledad Freeway because some wanted the land to be used for a park, and did not view the freeway as "necessary."

<a href="Construction%20bidding">Formal bids</a> began in February 1969 for the first section of SR 52 between I-5 and I-805. The state ordered the construction of this section on April 28, 1969. On Thursday, May 28, 1970, the Soledad Freeway opened, connecting Regents Road and Genesee Avenue with I-5; however, it did not connect to the unopened I-805. The road was built by Kasler, Ball and Yeager for $3.9 million (about $ in dollars). The construction firm deposited dirt into "an unnamed finger canyon" against the conditions of the city permit, and the city ordered the firm to remove it. The section of I-805 from SR 52 to El Cajon Boulevard was scheduled to be dedicated on March 20, 1972.

Ardath Road was renamed La Jolla Parkway on October 15, 2002, for two reasons: a nearby residential street was also named Ardath Road, and there was a desire to draw attention to this primary route to downtown La Jolla. This required the city of San Diego to pay $20,000 (about $ in dollars) to replace the signs on SR 52.

The second phase of SR 52 from I-805 to past <a href="U.S.%20Route%20395%20in%20California">U.S. Route 395</a> (which became I-15 in 1974) was projected to cost $29.4 million (about $ in dollars). The new freeway was to provide access to Tierrasanta and reduce the traffic on <a href="Interstate%208">I-8</a>. The U.S. Navy was consulted in the planning process due to the road's proposed routing through <a href="MCAS%20Miramar">MCAS Miramar</a> that would provide a delineation against further urban development. There were no concerns expressed at the public hearing on November 17, 1970; however, construction did not begin for more than ten years, as California governor <a href="Jerry%20Brown">Jerry Brown</a> stalled the construction of SR 52 from Santo Road to SR 67. In 1977, the county supervisor, a San Diego City councilman, and the mayors of La Mesa and National City wrote a letter to Brown to ask for the construction of this portion of SR 125 and other freeways, due to concerns about the types of congestion seen in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> coming to San Diego due to the incomplete freeway system. San Diego City Councilman Tom Gade wrote a telegram to Caltrans Director <a href="Adriana%20Gianturco">Adriana Gianturco</a> about the possible deletions; in response, Gianturco clarified that the plans were only being reconsidered and had not been removed, and a CHC member criticized the tone of the original telegram, calling it "intemperate". In 1984, Leo Trombatore, the Caltrans Director under California governor <a href="George%20Deukmejian">George Deukmejian</a>, requested to the <a href="California%20Transportation%20Commission">California Transportation Commission</a> (CTC) that "formal studies toward this end be initiated immediately. Route 52 has a high statewide priority." The CTC followed the director's wishes, approving the studies.

The first part of this phase, from I-805 to Convoy Street, began construction in December 1986. It was dedicated at a community celebration on July 11, 1987, and was scheduled to open to traffic a few weeks later. The first <a href="callbox">callbox</a>es in San Diego County were installed on SR 52 near Convoy Street on June 20, 1988. On June 30, 1988, SR 52 from Convoy Street to Santo Road opened to traffic. The I-15 interchange was built with state funds from the CTC.

In 2000, Hazard Construction Company added a single westbound lane on SR 52 from SR 163 to I-805, a distance of , at a cost of $1.7 million (about $ in dollars). In 2006, the <a href="San%20Diego%20Metropolitan%20Transit%20System">Metropolitan Transit System</a>, in cooperation with the <a href="San%20Diego%20Association%20of%20Governments">San Diego Association of Governments</a> (SANDAG), Caltrans, and the <a href="California%20Highway%20Patrol">California Highway Patrol</a>, began a pilot program to run transit buses along the shoulders of SR 52 between Kearny Villa Road and I-805. During <a href="rush%20hour">rush hour</a>, buses were able to use these shoulders to bypass slow traffic in the main lanes. The trial was considered successful as more than 99 percent of trips arrived on time, customer feedback was favorable and no safety concerns were encountered. On May 9, 2007, the "<a href="San%20Diego%20Union-Tribune">San Diego Union-Tribune</a>" published a story which raised reader concerns about a dangerous dip in the freeway. The dip had developed in a section of the highway constructed on top of the Miramar Landfill, and had been caused by trash settling; it was repaired by the next day.

The planning process for the remainder of SR 52 began as early as 1970, when the initial plan was to route the freeway through the city of Santee along Mission Gorge Road and the San Diego River. Planning was delayed until 1984, along with the construction of the I-805 to Santo Road segment. The City of Santee opposed the original plans, hoping to route the freeway on Prospect Avenue or north of the San Diego River. By April 1985, a second route along Prospect Avenue, proposed by Caltrans, earned the support of the City Council; however, the required demolition of many small businesses led many of those affected to start a petition against this route. On the other hand, there were objections about the "river route" costing approximately $15 million more (about $ in dollars) and cutting through a future "Town Center development". The <a href="Lakeside%2C%20California">Lakeside</a> Chamber of Commerce preferred the route along the San Diego River, citing the proximity to that city. The environmental impact report was found to be deficient by the <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a> in late 1986.

In January 1987, the Santee City Council voted to commence a study of a more northern route, even though local residents and workers objected that this would postpone construction. In March, the study, done by BSI Inc., supported the Caltrans decision to abandon plans for the northern path due to the increased cost from the "mountainous, undeveloped" terrain. The council voted to support a southern alignment through the town, with both the Prospect Avenue and San Diego River alternatives still viable. In the same month, the mayor of <a href="La%20Mesa%2C%20California">La Mesa</a>, Fred Nagel, started a petition drive supporting the extension of the freeway due to the recurring traffic on I-8. The Caltrans environmental impact report indicated that the Prospect Avenue route would cost $89 million (about $ in dollars), compared to the river route's $121 million (about $ in dollars). The city council of <a href="El%20Cajon%2C%20California">El Cajon</a> publicly supported the Prospect Avenue routing; however, some employees of the City of Santee, including some city planners and engineers, were concerned that portions of the report were "outdated." The petitions were given to the CTC in May, when San Diego officials made several arguments in support of the construction.

In June 1987, the CTC staff initially recommended against allocating money for the SR 52 segment; however, SANDAG agreed to fund the project with $1 million (about $ in dollars). Residents of Santee opposed the possible routes through the city at a public forum on June 10 because of the necessary destruction of homes to build on those routes. In late June, Caltrans considered making small modifications to the Prospect Avenue alignment to destroy fewer homes, including those in mobile home parks. On June 25, 1987, the CTC voted to support the SR 52 extension, with the requirement that $4.8 million (about $ in dollars) come from local funding sources. Finally, on September 23, the City of Santee recommended the Prospect Avenue Route to the CTC.
In July 1987, the <a href="U.S.%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a> expressed concerns that construction near the San Diego River crossing might result in the destruction of the endangered <a href="least%20Bell%27s%20vireo">least Bell's vireo</a> habitat. Two of the four alternative routes considered by Caltrans passed through the Carlton Hills golf course, which the public opposed. In April 1988, the <a href="Sierra%20Club">Sierra Club</a> denounced the Prospect Avenue route; federal negotiators recommended shifting the route from Hollins Lake towards the golf course. Environmental concerns raised in June 1988 related to the least Bell's vireo included decrease of insects, a darker environment after overpasses are constructed, and the fragmenting of habitat. Nevertheless, Caltrans still desired the Prospect Avenue route over concerns of a more expensive and less traveled northern route. Upset because of the delays, the Santee City Council wrote to U.S. senators <a href="Pete%20Wilson">Pete Wilson</a> and <a href="Alan%20Cranston">Alan Cranston</a>, asking for their assistance. Councilman Jim Bartell alleged that the issue would affect the city council elections.

In March 1989, the Fish and Wildlife Service agreed to the project, on the conditions of altering the route to cross the San Diego River and pass east of the center of the town, and constructing 44 acres of additional habitat as <a href="Environmental%20mitigation">mitigation</a>. SANDAG voted against building a full bicycle lane along the route in July 1989, citing the high costs. Finally, on July 27, the final routing of SR 52 was determined, running along Prospect Avenue. In May 1990, Santee councilman Roy Woodward was censured for having a <a href="conflict%20of%20interest">conflict of interest</a> in voting to support the proposals for the freeway because he "held interests" in three properties that would benefit from the freeway, thus violating the <a href="Political%20Reform%20Act">Political Reform Act</a> as these interests exceeded $10,000. One of the holdings was near Cuyamaca Street, the location of an offramp on a path that he voted to support. He was fined $2,000 (about $ in dollars) for each property, for a total of $6,000 (about $ in dollars).

In April 1990, the Santee City Council agreed to begin purchasing land, over the environmental concerns of Councilman Jim Bartell. Construction finally began on the four-lane section of SR 52 between Santo Road and Mission Gorge Road on July 19, 1991. The work was projected to cost $52 million (about $ in dollars). For environmental mitigation, a new songbird habitat was constructed that cost $8.3 million (about $ in dollars). Fossils of "small foraging mammals" were discovered during construction in late 1991. The construction company, HDB Construction, was required to keep noise below 61 decibels to protect the birds. The project was funded primarily with revenue from a voter-approved sales tax in 1987. The opening of this portion was scheduled for December 16, 1993. This new segment ended just southeast of the Mast Boulevard interchange, after the San Diego River overpass.

The opening of this stretch of SR 52 had many effects on the transportation of the <a href="East%20County%20%28San%20Diego%29">East County</a> region. Traffic decreased significantly on I-8 in early 1994, with an estimated 30,000 commuters switching from I-8 to SR 52. Fewer cars traveled on the western part of Mission Gorge Road, leading to a decrease in revenue for businesses located along that road. On Mast Boulevard and Mission Gorge Road in Santee, much more traffic was present, leading to residents complaining to the city. In 1998, the city began to widen Mission Gorge Road between Carlton Hills Drive and Fanita Road to handle the extra traffic from the incomplete SR 52.

The year after the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>, the military erected a fence to block a deer tunnel underneath the freeway that connected the base and Mission Trails Regional Park, since the tunnel could be used to gain unauthorized access to the base. In 2006, construction began to add a third lane on westbound SR 52 between Mast Boulevard and Santo Road. The expansion cost $3.4 million (about $ in dollars) and was funded by the state and the county TransNet sales tax. The new lane opened on May 8, 2007; however, the widening generated complaints from angry commuters facing a "bottleneck" at Santo Road. Because the additional lane was constructed in portions, the opening of the third lane between Santo Road and the existing third lane closer to I-15 was delayed; however, construction for the missing was approved in April 2007. The extension opened on July 20, 2007.

Construction on the next portion of SR 52, from Mission Gorge Road to SR 125, was scheduled to begin in late 1995, at a total cost of $60 million (about $ in dollars) for the entire project. Property acquisition began in 1994, with many property owners along the south side of Mission Gorge Road being forced to move out of the way of the freeway and subsequent road construction, as Mission Gorge Road was moved south to accommodate the new freeway. About $40 million ($ in dollars) was spent on the property acquisition. After weather-related construction delays due to the <a href="El%20Ni%C3%B1o">El Niño</a> season of the winter of 1997–1998, the extension of SR 52 between Mission Gorge Road and SR 125 was dedicated on May 9, 1998. The eastbound lanes were scheduled to be opened a few days later, and the westbound lanes were to be opened in mid-July of that year. L.R. Hubbard Construction Company built the portion for $17 million (about $ in dollars).

The city of Santee faced problems in the construction of the freeway from SR 125 to SR 67. As early as 1995, it was clear that the <a href="environmental%20impact%20report">environmental impact report</a> was delayed and that there would be funding difficulties. SANDAG allocated $23 million dollars (about $ in dollars) in 1999 to purchase properties needed for the <a href="right-of-way%20%28transportation%29">right-of-way</a>. In 2001, SANDAG gave $138 million (about $ in dollars) to the expansion of SR 52 to SR 67, which was necessary for extending the freeway past Cuyamaca Street. But by 2003, the transportation committee of SANDAG voted to delay the project due to decreased state funding. The city of Santee was required to make improvements to Forester Creek to accommodate potential flooding, which cost $30 million (about $ in dollars); the work began in May 2006. Funding issues were finally resolved in 2006 with voter-approved statewide transportation bonds. In 2007, highway construction costs increased; that year, the SANDAG transportation committee voted to fund the construction, taking money from a planned <a href="reversible%20lanes">reversible lanes</a> project on SR 52.

"Heavy construction" of SR 52 from SR 125 eastward to SR 67 began in February 2008. More than 360 properties were acquired to build the freeway; at least 60 were mobile homes. This portion was divided into three construction projects: from SR 125 to Cuyamaca Street, from there to Magnolia Avenue, and the interchange with SR 67, which began construction in mid-June 2008. The middle project had to be shut down briefly in February 2009 due to funding issues. Completion was scheduled for 2010, but was postponed to early 2011 due to weather-related delays. This new portion was opened to traffic on March 29, 2011. The cost of this project was $525 million, funded with state and federal funds as well as TransNet revenue. The opening was predicted to reduce traffic on I-8 as well as Mission Gorge Road and other Santee thoroughfares. The official "ribbon cutting" ceremony took place on March 19, 2011 on the freeway at the Cuyamaca Street interchange.

Reactions to the extension between SR 125 and SR 67 were mixed. There were reports of faster transportation through the East County area, yet commuters noted a rush hour backup at SR 125 headed westbound because there were only two lanes traveling west through the interchange. Traffic along Mission Gorge Road was reported to have decreased by 20 percent.

There are plans to add one lane in each direction, as well as two reversible lanes, from I-15 to SR 125. These plans were put on hold in 2008 due to a budget shortfall. Completion is scheduled to take place by 2040. Caltrans recommends adding two more lanes between I-5 and I-805, and two <a href="High-occupancy%20vehicle%20lane">HOV lanes</a> between I-805 and I-15.

Grasshopper

Grasshoppers are a group of <a href="insect">insect</a>s belonging to the <a href="suborder">suborder</a> <a href="Caelifera">Caelifera</a>. They are among what is probably the most ancient living group of chewing herbivorous insects, dating back to the <a href="early%20Triassic">early Triassic</a> around 250 million years ago. 

Grasshoppers are typically ground-dwelling insects with powerful hind legs which allow them to escape from threats by leaping vigorously. As <a href="hemimetabolous">hemimetabolous</a> insects, they do not undergo <a href="complete%20metamorphosis">complete metamorphosis</a>; they hatch from an egg into a <a href="Nymph%20%28biology%29">nymph</a> or "hopper" which undergoes five <a href="moult">moult</a>s, becoming more similar to the adult insect at each developmental stage. At high population densities and under certain environmental conditions, some grasshopper species can change color and behavior and form swarms. Under these circumstances, they are known as <a href="locust">locust</a>s.

Grasshoppers are plant-eaters, with a few species at times becoming serious <a href="pest%20%28organism%29">pest</a>s of cereals, vegetables and pasture, especially when they swarm in their millions as locusts and destroy crops over wide areas. They protect themselves from <a href="predator">predator</a>s by <a href="camouflage">camouflage</a>; when detected, many species attempt to <a href="Deimatic%20behaviour">startle</a> the predator with a brilliantly-coloured wing-flash while jumping and (if adult) launching themselves into the air, usually flying for only a short distance. Other species such as the <a href="rainbow%20grasshopper">rainbow grasshopper</a> have <a href="warning%20coloration">warning coloration</a> which deters predators. Grasshoppers are affected by parasites and various diseases, and many predatory creatures feed on both nymphs and adults. The eggs are the subject of attack by <a href="parasitoid">parasitoid</a>s and predators.

Grasshoppers have had a long relationship with humans. Swarms of locusts can have devastating effects and cause famine, and even in smaller numbers, the insects can be serious pests. They are used as food in countries such as Mexico and Indonesia. They feature in art, symbolism and literature.

Grasshoppers belong to the suborder Caelifera. Although, "grasshopper" is sometimes used as a common name for the suborder in general, some sources restrict it to the more "advanced" groups. They may be placed in the infraorder <a href="Acrididea">Acrididea</a> and have been referred-to as "short-horned grasshoppers" in older texts to distinguish them from the also-obsolete term "long-horned grasshoppers" (now <a href="bush-cricket">bush-cricket</a>s or katydids) with their much longer <a href="Antenna%20%28biology%29">antennae</a>. The <a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a> of the Caelifera, based on mitochondrial <a href="ribosomal%20RNA">ribosomal RNA</a> of thirty-two taxa in six out of seven superfamilies, is shown as a <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a>. The <a href="Ensifera">Ensifera</a> (crickets, "etc.") Caelifera and all the superfamilies of grasshoppers except Pamphagoidea appear to be <a href="monophyletic">monophyletic</a>.

In evolutionary terms, the split between the Caelifera and the Ensifera is no more recent than the <a href="Permo-Triassic%20boundary">Permo-Triassic boundary</a>; the earliest insects that are certainly Caeliferans are in the extinct families Locustopseidae and Locustavidae from the early Triassic, roughly 250 million years ago. The group diversified during the Triassic and have remained important plant-eaters from that time to now. The first modern families such as the Eumastacidae, Tetrigidae and Tridactylidae appeared in the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>, though some insects that might belong to the last two of these groups are found in the <a href="early%20Jurassic">early Jurassic</a>. Morphological classification is difficult because many taxa have converged towards a common habitat type; recent taxonomists have concentrated on the internal genitalia, especially those of the male. This information is not available from fossil specimens, and the palaentological taxonomy is founded principally on the venation of the hindwings.

The Caelifera includes some 2,400 valid genera and about 11,000 known species. Many undescribed species probably exist, especially in <a href="tropical%20wet%20forest">tropical wet forest</a>s. The Caelifera have a predominantly tropical distribution with fewer species known from temperate zones, but most of the superfamilies have representatives worldwide. They are almost exclusively herbivorous and are probably the oldest living group of chewing herbivorous insects.

The most diverse superfamily is the <a href="Acridoidea">Acridoidea</a>, with around 8,000 species. The two main families in this are the Acrididae (grasshoppers and locusts) with a worldwide distribution, and the <a href="Romaleidae">Romaleidae</a> (lubber grasshoppers), found chiefly in the New World. The Ommexechidae and Tristiridae are South American, and the Lentulidae, Lithidiidae and Pamphagidae are mainly African. The Pauliniids are nocturnal and can swim or skate on water, and the Lentulids are wingless. Pneumoridae are native to Africa, particularly southern Africa, and are distinguished by the inflated abdomens of the males.

Grasshoppers have the typical insect body plan of head, <a href="Thorax%20%28insect%20anatomy%29">thorax</a> and <a href="Abdomen%23Invertebrates">abdomen</a>. The head is held vertically at an angle to the body, with the mouth at the bottom. The head bears a large pair of <a href="compound%20eye">compound eye</a>s which give all-round vision, three simple eyes which can detect light and dark, and a pair of thread-like <a href="Antenna%20%28biology%29">antennae</a> that are sensitive to touch and smell. The downward-directed mouthparts are modified for chewing and there are two sensory palps in front of the <a href="Mandible%20%28insect%20mouthpart%29">jaws</a>.

The thorax and abdomen are segmented and have a rigid <a href="cuticle">cuticle</a> made up of overlapping plates composed of <a href="chitin">chitin</a>. The three fused thoracic segments bear three pairs of legs and two pairs of wings. The forewings, known as <a href="tegmina">tegmina</a>, are narrow and leathery while the hindwings are large and membranous, the veins providing strength. The legs are terminated by claws for gripping. The hind leg is particularly powerful; the femur is robust and has several ridges where different surfaces join and the inner ridges bear <a href="stridulatory">stridulatory</a> pegs in some species. The posterior edge of the tibia bears a double row of spines and there are a pair of articulated spurs near its lower end. The interior of the thorax houses the muscles that control the wings and legs.
The abdomen has eleven segments, the first of which is fused to the thorax and contains the <a href="tympanal%20organ">tympanal organ</a> and hearing system. Segments two to eight are ring-shaped and joined by flexible membranes. Segments nine to eleven are reduced in size; segment nine bears a pair of <a href="cercus">cerci</a> and segments ten and eleven house the reproductive organs. Female grasshoppers are normally <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">larger than males</a>, with short ovipositors. The name of the suborder "Caelifera" comes from the Latin and means "chisel-bearing", referring to the shape of the ovipositor.

Those species that make easily heard noises usually do so by rubbing a row of pegs on the hind legs against the edges of the forewings (stridulation). These sounds are produced mainly by males to attract females, though in some species the females also stridulate.

Grasshoppers may be confused with crickets, but they differ in many aspects; these include the number of segments in their antennae and the structure of the ovipositor, as well as the location of the tympanal organ and the methods by which sound is produced. Ensiferans have antennae that can be much longer than the body and have at least 20–24 segments, while caeliferans have fewer segments in their shorter, stouter antennae.

Most grasshoppers are <a href="polyphagous">polyphagous</a>, eating vegetation from multiple plant sources, but some are <a href="omnivorous">omnivorous</a> and also eat animal tissue and animal faeces. In general their preference is for grasses, including many <a href="cereal">cereal</a>s grown as crops. The digestive system is typical of insects, with Malpighian tubules discharging into the midgut. Carbohydrates are digested mainly in the crop, while proteins are digested in the ceca of the midgut. Saliva is abundant but largely free of enzymes, helping to move food and Malpighian secretions along the gut. Some grasshoppers possess <a href="cellulase">cellulase</a>, which by softening plant cell walls makes plant cell contents accessible to other digestive enzymes.

Grasshoppers have a typical insect nervous system, and have an extensive set of external sense organs. On the side of the head are a pair of large <a href="compound%20eyes">compound eyes</a> which give a broad field of vision and can detect movement, shape, colour and distance. There are also three simple eyes (<a href="ocelli">ocelli</a>) on the forehead which can detect light intensity, a pair of antennae containing olfactory (smell) and touch receptors, and mouthparts containing gustatory (taste) receptors. At the front end of the abdomen there is a pair of tympanal organs for sound reception. There are numerous fine hairs (<a href="setae">setae</a>) covering the whole body that act as mechanoreceptors (touch and wind sensors), and these are most dense on the antennae, the <a href="palp">palp</a>s (part of the mouth), and on the cerci at the tip of the abdomen. There are special receptors (<a href="campaniform%20sensilla">campaniform sensilla</a>e) embedded in the cuticle of the legs that sense pressure and cuticle distortion. There are internal "chordotonal" sense organs specialized to detect position and movement about the joints of the exoskeleton. The receptors convey information to the central nervous system through sensory neurons, and most of these have their cell bodies located in the periphery near the receptor site itself.

Like other insects, grasshoppers have an <a href="open%20circulatory%20system">open circulatory system</a> and their body cavities are filled with <a href="haemolymph">haemolymph</a>. A heart-like structure in the upper part of the abdomen pumps the fluid to the head from where it percolates past the tissues and organs on its way back to the abdomen. This system circulates nutrients throughout the body and carries <a href="metabolic%20waste">metabolic waste</a>s to be excreted into the gut. Other functions of the haemolymph include wound healing, heat transfer and the provision of hydrostatic pressure, but the circulatory system is not involved in gaseous exchange. Respiration is performed using <a href="Trachea%23Invertebrates">trachea</a>e, air-filled tubes, which open at the surfaces of the thorax and abdomen through pairs of valved <a href="spiracle">spiracle</a>s. Larger insects may need to actively ventilate their bodies by opening some spiracles while others remain closed, using abdominal muscles to expand and contract the body and pump air through the system.

A large grasshopper, such as a locust, can jump about a metre (twenty body lengths) without using its wings; the acceleration peaks at about 20 g. Grasshoppers jump by extending their large back legs and pushing against the substrate (the ground, a twig, a blade of grass or whatever else they are standing on); the reaction force propels them into the air. They jump for several reasons; to escape from a predator, to launch themselves into flight, or simply to move from place to place. For the escape jump in particular there is strong selective pressure to maximize take-off velocity, since this determines the range. This means that the legs must thrust against the ground with both high force and a high velocity of movement. A fundamental property of <a href="muscle%20contraction%23Force-length%20and%20force-velocity%20relationships">muscle</a> is that it cannot contract with high force and high velocity at the same time. Grasshoppers overcome this by using a <a href="catapult">catapult</a> mechanism to amplify the <a href="Power%20%28physics%29%23Mechanical%20power">mechanical power</a> produced by their muscles.

The jump is a three-stage process. First, the grasshopper fully flexes the lower part of the leg (tibia) against the upper part (femur) by activating the flexor tibiae muscle (the back legs of the grasshopper in the top photograph are in this preparatory position). Second, there is a period of co-contraction in which force builds up in the large, <a href="Pennate%20muscle">pennate</a> extensor tibiae muscle, but the tibia is kept flexed by the simultaneous contraction of the flexor tibiae muscle. The extensor muscle is much stronger than the flexor muscle, but the latter is aided by specialisations in the joint that give it a large effective mechanical advantage over the former when the tibia is fully flexed. Co-contraction can last for up to half a second, and during this period the extensor muscle shortens and stores elastic strain energy by distorting stiff cuticular structures in the leg. The extensor muscle contraction is quite slow (almost isometric), which allows it to develop high force (up to 14 N in the desert locust), but because it is slow only low power is needed. The third stage of the jump is the trigger relaxation of the flexor muscle, which releases the tibia from the flexed position. The subsequent rapid tibial extension is driven mainly by the relaxation of the elastic structures, rather than by further shortening of the extensor muscle. In this way the stiff cuticle acts like the elastic of a <a href="catapult">catapult</a>, or the bow of a bow-and-arrow. Energy is put into the store at low power by slow but strong muscle contraction, and retrieved from the store at high power by rapid relaxation of the mechanical elastic structures.

Male grasshoppers spend much of the day stridulating, singing more actively under optimal conditions and being more subdued when conditions are adverse; females also stridulate, but their efforts are insignificant when compared to the males. Late-stage male nymphs can sometimes be seen making stridulatory movements, although they lack the equipment to make sounds, demonstrating the importance of this behavioural trait. The songs are a means of communication; the male stridulation seems to express reproductive maturity, the desire for social cohesion and individual well-being. Social cohesion becomes necessary among grasshoppers because of their ability to jump or fly large distances, and the song can serve to limit dispersal and guide others to favourable habitat. The generalised song can vary in phraseology and intensity, and is modified in the presence of a rival male, and changes again to a courtship song when a female is nearby. In male grasshoppers of the family Pneumoridae, the enlarged abdomen amplifies stridulation.

In most grasshopper species, conflicts between males over females rarely escalate beyond ritualistic displays. Some exceptions include the chameleon grasshopper ("<a href="Kosciuscola">Kosciuscola tristis</a>"), where males may fight on top of ovipositing females; engaging in leg grappling, biting, kicking and mounting.

The newly emerged female grasshopper has a preoviposition period of a week or two while she increases in weight and her eggs mature. After mating, the female of most species digs a hole with her <a href="ovipositor">ovipositor</a> and lays a batch of eggs in a pod in the ground near food plants, generally in the summer. After laying the eggs, she covers the hole with soil and litter. Some, like the semi-aquatic "<a href="Cornops%20aquaticum">Cornops aquaticum</a>", deposit the pod directly into plant tissue. The eggs in the pod are glued together with a froth in some species. After a few weeks of development, the eggs of most species in temperate climates go into <a href="diapause">diapause</a>, and pass the winter in this state. Diapause is broken by a sufficiently low ground temperature, with development resuming as soon as the ground warms above a certain threshold temperature. The embryos in a pod generally all hatch out within a few minutes of each other. They soon shed their membranes and their exoskeletons harden. These first <a href="instar">instar</a> nymphs can then jump away from predators.
Grasshoppers undergo <a href="incomplete%20metamorphosis">incomplete metamorphosis</a>: they <a href="ecdysis">repeatedly moult</a>, each instar becoming larger and more like an adult, with the wing-buds increasing in size at each stage. The number of instars varies between species but is often six. After the final moult, the wings are inflated and become fully functional. The migratory grasshopper, "Melanoplus sanguinipes", spends about 25 to 30 days as a nymph, depending on sex and temperature, and lives for about 51 days as an adult.

Locusts are the swarming phase of certain species of short-horned grasshoppers in the family Acrididae. Swarming behaviour is a response to overcrowding. Increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs causes an increase in levels of <a href="serotonin">serotonin</a>. This causes the grasshopper to change colour, feed more and breed faster. The transformation of a solitary individual into a swarming one is induced by several contacts per minute over a short period.

Following this transformation, under suitable conditions dense nomadic bands of flightless nymphs known as "hoppers" can occur, producing <a href="pheromone">pheromone</a>s which attract the insects to each other. With several generations in a year, the locust population can build up from localised groups into vast accumulations of flying insects known as plagues, devouring all the vegetation they encounter. The <a href="Albert%27s%20swarm">largest recorded locust swarm</a> was one formed by the now-extinct <a href="Rocky%20Mountain%20locust">Rocky Mountain locust</a> in 1875; the swarm was long and wide, and one estimate puts the number of locusts involved at 3.5 trillion.
An adult <a href="desert%20locust">desert locust</a> can eat about of plant material each day, so the billions of insects in a large swarm can be very destructive, stripping all the foliage from plants in an affected area and consuming stems, flowers, fruits, seeds and bark.

Grasshoppers have a wide range of <a href="predator">predator</a>s at different stages of their lives; eggs are eaten by <a href="bee-flies">bee-flies</a>, <a href="ground%20beetle">ground beetle</a>s and <a href="blister%20beetle">blister beetle</a>s; hoppers and adults are taken by other insects such as <a href="ant">ant</a>s, <a href="robber%20flies">robber flies</a> and <a href="sphecid%20wasp">sphecid wasp</a>s, by <a href="spider">spider</a>s, and by many birds and small mammals including dogs and cats.

The eggs and nymphs are under attack by <a href="parasitoid">parasitoid</a>s including <a href="blow%20flies">blow flies</a>, flesh flies, and <a href="tachinid%20flies">tachinid flies</a>. External parasites of adults and nymphs include mites. Female grasshoppers parasitised by mites produce fewer eggs and thus have fewer offspring than unaffected individuals.
The <a href="Mermis%20nigrescens">grasshopper nematode</a> ("Mermis nigrescens") is a long slender worm that infects grasshoppers, living in the insect's <a href="Circulatory%20system">hemocoel</a>. Adult worms lay eggs on plants and the host becomes infected when the foliage is eaten. "<a href="Spinochordodes%20tellinii">Spinochordodes tellinii</a>" and "<a href="Paragordius%20tricuspidatus">Paragordius tricuspidatus</a>" are parasitic worms that infect grasshoppers and alter the behaviour of their hosts. When the worms are sufficiently developed, the grasshopper is persuaded to leap into a nearby body of water where it drowns, thus enabling the parasite to continue with the next stage of its <a href="Biological%20life%20cycle">life cycle</a>, which takes place in water.
Grasshoppers are affected by diseases caused by <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>, <a href="virus">virus</a>es, <a href="Fungus">fungi</a> and <a href="protozoa">protozoa</a>. The bacteria "<a href="Serratia%20marcescens">Serratia marcescens</a>" and "<a href="Pseudomonas%20aeruginosa">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</a>" have both been implicated in causing disease in grasshoppers, as has the <a href="entomopathogenic%20fungus">entomopathogenic fungus</a> "<a href="Beauveria%20bassiana">Beauveria bassiana</a>". This widespread fungus has been used to control various pest insects around the world, but although it infects grasshoppers, the infection is not usually lethal because basking in the sun has the result of raising the insect's temperature above a threshold tolerated by the fungus. The fungal <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a> "<a href="Entomophaga%20grylli">Entomophaga grylli</a>" is able to influence the behaviour of its grasshopper host, causing it to climb to the top of a plant and cling to the stem as it dies. This ensures wide dispersal of the fungal spores liberated from the corpse.

The fungal pathogen "<a href="Metarhizium%20acridum">Metarhizium acridum</a>" is found in Africa, Australia and Brazil where it has caused <a href="epizootic">epizootic</a>s in grasshoppers. It is being investigated for possible use as a microbial insecticide for locust control. The <a href="microsporidia">microsporidia</a>n fungus "<a href="Nosema%20locustae">Nosema locustae</a>", once considered to be a protozoan, can be lethal to grasshoppers. It has to be consumed by mouth and is the basis for a bait-based commercial microbial pesticide. Various other microsporidians and protozoans are found in the gut.

Grasshoppers exemplify a range of <a href="anti-predator%20adaptation">anti-predator adaptation</a>s, enabling them to avoid detection, to escape if detected, and in some cases to avoid being eaten if captured. Grasshoppers are often <a href="camouflage">camouflage</a>d to avoid detection by predators that hunt by sight; some species can change their coloration to suit their surroundings.

Several species such as the hooded leaf grasshopper "<a href="Phyllochoreia">Phyllochoreia ramakrishnai</a>" (Eumastacoidea) are detailed <a href="mimicry">mimics</a> of leaves. Stick grasshoppers (Proscopiidae) mimic wooden sticks in form and coloration. Grasshoppers often have <a href="deimatic">deimatic</a> patterns on their wings, giving a sudden flash of bright colours that may startle predators long enough to give time to escape in a combination of jump and flight.

Some species are genuinely <a href="aposematic">aposematic</a>, having both bright warning coloration and sufficient toxicity to dissuade predators. "<a href="Dictyophorus%20productus">Dictyophorus productus</a>" (Pyrgomorphidae) is a "heavy, bloated, sluggish insect" that makes no attempt to hide; it has a bright red abdomen. A "<a href="Cercopithecus">Cercopithecus</a>" monkey that ate other grasshoppers refused to eat the species. Another species, the rainbow or painted grasshopper of Arizona, "<a href="Dactylotum%20bicolor">Dactylotum bicolor</a>" (Acridoidea), has been shown by experiment with a natural predator, the <a href="little%20striped%20whiptail">little striped whiptail</a> lizard, to be aposematic.

Grasshoppers are occasionally depicted in artworks, such as the <a href="Dutch%20Golden%20Age">Dutch Golden Age</a> painter <a href="Balthasar%20van%20der%20Ast">Balthasar van der Ast</a>'s <a href="still%20life">still life</a> oil painting, "Flowers in a Vase with Shells and Insects", c. 1630, now in the <a href="National%20Gallery%2C%20London">National Gallery, London</a>, though the insect may be a bush-cricket.

Another orthopteran is found in <a href="Rachel%20Ruysch">Rachel Ruysch</a>'s still life "Flowers in a Vase", c. 1685. The seemingly static scene is animated by a "grasshopper on the table that looks about ready to spring", according to the gallery curator Betsy Wieseman, with other invertebrates including a spider, an ant, and two caterpillars.

Grasshoppers are also featured in cinema. The 1957 film "<a href="Beginning%20of%20the%20End%20%28film%29">Beginning of the End</a>" portrayed giant grasshoppers attacking <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>. In the 1998 <a href="Pixar">Pixar</a> film "<a href="A%20Bug%27s%20Life">A Bug's Life</a>", the heroes are the members of an ant colony, and the lead villain and his henchmen are grasshoppers.

Grasshoppers are sometimes used as symbols. During the <a href="Archaic%20Greece">Greek Archaic Era</a>, the grasshopper was the symbol of the "<a href="polis">polis</a>" of <a href="Classical%20Athens">Athens</a>, possibly because they were among the most common insects on the dry plains of <a href="Attica">Attica</a>. Native Athenians for a while wore golden grasshopper brooches to symbolise that they were of pure Athenian lineage with no foreign ancestors. Another symbolic use of the grasshopper is Sir <a href="Thomas%20Gresham">Thomas Gresham</a>'s gilded grasshopper in <a href="Lombard%20Street%2C%20London">Lombard Street, London</a>, dating from 1563; the building was for a while the headquarters of the <a href="Guardian%20Royal%20Exchange">Guardian Royal Exchange</a>, but the company declined to use the symbol for fear of confusion with the locust.

When grasshoppers appear in dreams, these have been interpreted as symbols of "Freedom, independence, spiritual enlightenment, inability to settle down or commit to decision". Locusts are taken literally to mean devastation of crops in the case of farmers; figuratively as "wicked men and women" for non-farmers; and "Extravagance, misfortune, & ephemeral happiness" by "gypsies".

In some countries, grasshoppers are used as food. In southern <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>, grasshoppers, known as "<a href="chapulines">chapulines</a>", are eaten in a variety of dishes, such as in <a href="tortilla">tortilla</a>s with chilli sauce. Grasshoppers are served on skewers in some Chinese food markets, like the <a href="Donghuamen%20Night%20Market">Donghuamen Night Market</a>. Fried grasshoppers ("walang goreng") are eaten in the <a href="Gunung%20Kidul%20Regency">Gunung Kidul Regency</a>, <a href="Special%20Region%20of%20Yogyakarta">Yogyakarta</a>, <a href="Java">Java</a> in Indonesia. In America, the <a href="Ohlone">Ohlone</a> burned grassland to herd grasshoppers into pits where they could be collected as food.
It is recorded in the Bible that <a href="John%20the%20Baptist">John the Baptist</a> ate locusts and wild honey (Greek: ἀκρίδες καὶ μέλι ἄγριον, "akrídes kaì méli ágrion") while living in the wilderness; attempts have been made to explain the locusts as suitably <a href="ascetic">ascetic</a> <a href="vegetarian">vegetarian</a> food such as <a href="carob">carob</a> beans, but the plain meaning of ἀκρίδες is the insects.

Grasshoppers eat large quantities of foliage both as adults and during their development, and can be serious pests of arid land and prairies. Pasture, grain, forage, vegetable and other crops can be affected. Grasshoppers often bask in the sun, and thrive in warm sunny conditions, so drought stimulates an increase in grasshopper populations. A single season of drought is not normally sufficient to stimulate a major population increase, but several successive dry seasons can do so, especially if the intervening winters are mild so that large numbers of nymphs survive. Although sunny weather stimulates growth, there needs to be an adequate food supply for the increasing grasshopper population. This means that although precipitation is needed to stimulate plant growth, prolonged periods of cloudy weather will slow nymphal development.

Grasshoppers can best be prevented from becoming pests by manipulating their environment. Shade provided by trees will discourage them and they may be prevented from moving onto developing crops by removing coarse vegetation from fallow land and field margins and discouraging thick growth beside ditches and on roadside verges. With increasing numbers of grasshoppers, predator numbers may increase, but this seldom happens rapidly enough to have much effect on populations. Biological control is being investigated, and spores of the protozoan parasite "<a href="Nosema%20locustae">Nosema locustae</a>" can be used mixed with bait to control grasshoppers, being more effective with immature insects. On a small scale, <a href="Azadirachta%20indica">neem products</a> can be effective as a feeding deterrent and as a disruptor of nymphal development. <a href="Insecticide">Insecticide</a>s can be used, but adult grasshoppers are difficult to kill, and as they move into fields from surrounding rank growth, crops may soon become reinfested.

Some grasshopper species, like the Chinese rice grasshopper, are a pest in <a href="rice">rice</a> paddies. Ploughing exposes the eggs on the surface of the field, to be destroyed by sunshine or eaten by natural enemies. Some eggs may be buried too deeply in the soil for hatching to take place.

Locust plagues can have devastating effects on human populations, causing <a href="famine">famine</a>s and population upheavals. They are mentioned in both the <a href="Quran">Koran</a> and the <a href="Bible">Bible</a> and have also been held responsible for <a href="cholera">cholera</a> epidemics, resulting from the corpses of locusts drowned in the Mediterranean Sea and decomposing on beaches. The <a href="Food%20and%20Agriculture%20Organization">FAO</a> and other organisations monitor locust activity around the world. Timely application of pesticides can prevent nomadic bands of hoppers from forming before dense swarms of adults can build up. Besides conventional control using contact insecticides, <a href="biological%20pest%20control">biological pest control</a> using the <a href="entomopathogenic%20fungus">entomopathogenic fungus</a> "<a href="Metarhizium%20acridum">Metarhizium acridum</a>", which specifically infects grasshoppers, has been used with some success.

The Egyptian word for locust or grasshopper was written "snḥm" in the consonantal hieroglyphic writing system. The pharaoh <a href="Ramesses%20II">Ramesses II</a> compared the armies of the <a href="Hittites">Hittites</a> to locusts: "They covered the mountains and valleys and were like locusts in their multitude."

One of <a href="Aesop%27s%20Fables">Aesop's Fables</a>, later retold by <a href="La%20Fontaine">La Fontaine</a>, is the tale of "<a href="The%20Ant%20and%20the%20Grasshopper">The Ant and the Grasshopper</a>". The ant works hard all summer, while the grasshopper plays. In winter, the ant is ready but the grasshopper starves. <a href="Somerset%20Maugham">Somerset Maugham</a>'s short story "The Ant and the Grasshopper" explores the fable's symbolism via complex framing. Other human weaknesses besides improvidence have become identified with the grasshopper's behaviour. So an unfaithful woman (hopping from man to man) is "a grasshopper" in "Poprygunya", an 1892 short story by <a href="Anton%20Chekhov">Anton Chekhov</a>, and in <a href="Jerry%20Paris">Jerry Paris</a>'s 1969 film "<a href="The%20Grasshopper%20%281970%20film%29">The Grasshopper</a>".

The name "Grasshopper" was given to the <a href="Aeronca%20L-3">Aeronca L-3</a> and <a href="Piper%20L-4">Piper L-4</a> light aircraft, both used for <a href="reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> and other support duties in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The name is said to have originated when Major General <a href="Innis%20P.%20Swift">Innis P. Swift</a> saw a Piper making a rough landing and remarked that it looked like a "damned grasshopper" for its bouncing progress.

<a href="Grasshopper%20beam%20engine">Grasshopper beam engine</a>s were <a href="beam%20engine">beam engine</a>s pivoted at one end, the long horizontal arm resembling the hind leg of a grasshopper. The type was patented by William Freemantle in 1803.

Shrine of Remembrance

The Shrine of Remembrance (commonly known among locals as The Shrine) is a war memorial in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, Australia, located in <a href="Kings%20Domain">Kings Domain</a> on <a href="St%20Kilda%20Road%2C%20Melbourne">St Kilda Road</a>. It was built to honour the men and women of <a href="Victoria%2C%20Australia">Victoria</a> who served in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, but is now a memorial to all Australians who have served in war. It is a site of annual observances of <a href="ANZAC%20Day">ANZAC Day</a> (25 April) and <a href="Remembrance%20Day">Remembrance Day</a> (11 November) and is one of the largest war memorials in Australia.

Designed by architects <a href="Hudson%20and%20Wardrop">Phillip Hudson and James Wardrop</a> who were both World War I veterans, the Shrine is in a <a href="classicism">classical</a> style, being based on the <a href="Tomb%20of%20Mausolus">Tomb of Mausolus</a> at <a href="Halicarnassus">Halicarnassus</a> and the <a href="Parthenon">Parthenon</a> in <a href="Athens">Athens</a>. The crowning element at the top of the memorial's ziggurat roof references the <a href="Choragic%20Monument%20of%20Lysicrates">Choragic Monument of Lysicrates</a>.
Built from <a href="Tynong%2C%20Victoria">Tynong</a> <a href="granite">granite</a>, the Shrine originally consisted only of the central sanctuary surrounded by the ambulatory. The sanctuary contains the <a href="marble">marble</a> Stone of Remembrance, upon which is engraved the words "Greater love hath no man". Once a year, on 11 November at 11 a.m. (Remembrance Day), a ray of sunlight shines through an aperture in the roof to light up the word "Love" in the inscription. Beneath the sanctuary lies the crypt, which contains a bronze statue of a soldier father and son, and panels listing every unit of the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a>.

The Shrine went through a prolonged process of development which began in 1918 with the initial proposal to build a Victorian memorial. Two committees were formed, the second of which ran a competition for the memorial's design. The winner was announced in 1922. However, opposition to the proposal (led by <a href="Keith%20Murdoch">Keith Murdoch</a> and "<a href="Herald%20Sun">The Herald</a>") forced the governments of the day to rethink the design, and a number of alternatives were proposed, the most significant of which was the ANZAC Square and <a href="cenotaph">cenotaph</a> proposal of 1926. In response, <a href="John%20Monash">General Sir John Monash</a> used the 1927 <a href="ANZAC%20Day">ANZAC Day</a> march to garner support for the Shrine, and finally won the support of the Victorian government later that year. The foundation stone was laid on 11 November 1927, and the Shrine was officially dedicated on 11 November 1934.

A war memorial in Melbourne was proposed as soon as the war ended in November 1918. In the early 1920s the Victorian state government appointed the War Memorials Advisory Committee, chaired by <a href="Walter%20Baldwin%20Spencer">Sir Baldwin Spencer</a>, which recommended an "arch of victory" over <a href="St%20Kilda%20Road%2C%20Melbourne">St Kilda Road</a>, the major boulevard leading out of the city of Melbourne to the south. In August 1921 an executive committee was formed, with the former commander of the Australian forces in the war, <a href="John%20Monash">General Sir John Monash</a>, as its driving force. The committee soon abandoned the idea of an arch and proposed a large monumental memorial to the east of St Kilda Road, a position which would make it clearly visible from the centre of the city. A competition was launched in March 1922 to find a design for the new memorial, open both to <a href="British%20subject">British subject</a>s residing in Australia and any Australian citizens who were residing overseas. A total of 83 entries were submitted, and in December 1923 the design offered by two Melbourne <a href="architect">architect</a>s (and war veterans), Phillip Hudson and James Wardrop, was announced as the winner.

The winning design had a number of supporters, including publications such as "<a href="The%20Age">The Age</a>" and <a href="George%20Augustine%20Taylor">George Taylor</a>'s Sydney-based trade journal, "Building", prominent citizens including artist <a href="Norman%20Lindsay">Norman Lindsay</a> and <a href="University%20of%20Sydney">University of Sydney</a> Dean of Architecture, <a href="Leslie%20Wilkinson">Leslie Wilkinson</a>, and the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (who had been heavily involved in the competition). Nevertheless, the design was also fiercely criticised in some quarters—especially by Keith Murdoch's "Herald", Murdoch reportedly describing the Shrine as "too severe, stiff and heavy, that there is no grace or beauty about it and that it is a tomb of gloom"—on the grounds of its grandiosity, its severity of design and its expense. As part of the campaign against the Shrine proposal, the "Herald" searched for alternative concepts, arguing that the funds could be better spent on more practical projects such as a hospital or a war widows' home. Furthermore, some <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> churches also attacked the design as <a href="Paganism">pagan</a> for having no <a href="crucifix">cross</a> or other Christian element.
The new Victorian <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Labor</a> government of 1924, under <a href="George%20Prendergast">George Prendergast</a>, supported the "Herald's" view, and pushed for a memorial hospital instead of the Shrine. When the Labor government was replaced with <a href="John%20Allan%20%28Australian%20politician%29">John Allan</a>'s <a href="National%20Party%20of%20Australia">Country</a>/<a href="Nationalist%20Party%20of%20Australia">National</a> coalition, the plan changed once again, leaning towards the earlier suggestion of an arch of victory to be built over St. Kilda Road. As a result of the debate, significant delays postponed the construction of the new memorial, so a temporary wood-and-plaster cenotaph was raised for the 1926 <a href="ANZAC%20Day">ANZAC Day</a> march. The success of the temporary cenotaph led the Victorian government to abandon the earlier project in 1926, and propose instead to build a permanent cenotaph in a large "ANZAC Square" at the top of Bourke St in front of <a href="Parliament%20House%2C%20Melbourne">Parliament House</a>. While this would have involved demolishing the <a href="Windsor%20Hotel%20%28Melbourne%29">Windsor Hotel</a>, one of Melbourne's favourite hotels, the new plan won the support of the "Herald", the <a href="Returned%20and%20Services%20League%20of%20Australia">Returned Soldiers League</a> (RSL) and the <a href="Melbourne%20City%20Council">Melbourne City Council</a>.

Nevertheless, both Monash and <a href="Legacy%20Australia">Legacy</a> still supported the Shrine. After a vote in favour of the Shrine by their executive council, Legacy started a public relations campaign, gaining the support of much of the media—although the council, state government and the "Herald" continued to oppose. In 1927, with the then <a href="Duke%20of%20York">Duke of York</a>, <a href="George%20VI%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prince Albert</a>, visiting the country, Monash spoke on the eve of ANZAC Day at the RSL dinner, arguing for the Shrine. The audience had been seeded with supporters, who provided a standing ovation at the conclusion of his speech, which helped to produce a groundswell of support. When a vote was called for, the majority voted in favour of the Shrine proposal. The next day, with Monash leading 30,000 veterans in the 1927 ANZAC Day march, and with the new support of the RSL, "The Age", and the "<a href="The%20Argus%20%28Australia%29">Argus</a>", the Shrine proposal had gained "new momentum". Faced with such support, and with Monash's arguments that the ANZAC Square would be prohibitively expensive, <a href="Edmond%20Hogan">Edmond Hogan</a>'s new Labor government decided in favour of the Shrine.

Another early point of contention (although not explicitly related to the nature of the memorial) concerned the possibility of incorporating a "<a href="Tomb%20of%20the%20Unknown%20Soldier">Tomb of the Unknown Soldier</a>" into the memorial—an approach that was championed by the St. Kilda RSL, who revealed plans to bury a soldier from either <a href="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</a> or <a href="France">France</a> on ANZAC Day, 25 April 1922. This proposal received considerable debate, and was countered by the argument that the <a href="Unknown%20Warrior">Unknown Warrior</a> in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> represented all of the dead of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>. Monash was on the side of those against such a burial, as while he could see a place for an Unknown Soldier in a national memorial, he did not feel that it would be suitable at the Victorian Shrine. The Stone of Remembrance was later placed in the position where an Unknown Soldier might have been laid. An Australian Unknown Soldier was eventually interred at the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a> by <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Paul%20Keating">Paul Keating</a> on 11 November 1993.

The foundation stone was laid on 11 November 1927, by the <a href="Governor%20of%20Victoria">Governor of Victoria</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Herbert%20Tennyson%20Somers%20Cocks%2C%206th%20Baron%20Somers">Lord Somers</a>. Although both the Victorian and Commonwealth governments made contributions, most of the cost of the Shrine (£160,000 out of a total of £250,000; equating to about £  out of £  in 2019) was raised in less than six months by public contributions, with Monash as chief fundraiser.

Monash, who was also an <a href="engineer">engineer</a>, took personal charge of the construction, which began in 1928 and was handled by the contractors Vaughan & Lodge. Monash died in 1931, before the Shrine was finished, but the Shrine was the cause "closest to his heart" in his later years.

Work was finally completed in September 1934, and the Shrine was formally dedicated on 11 November 1934 by the <a href="Prince%20Henry%2C%20Duke%20of%20Gloucester">Duke of Gloucester</a>, witnessed by a crowd of over 300,000 people—a "massive turnout" given that Melbourne's population at the time was approximately 1 million, and, according to <a href="Carl%20Bridge">Carl Bridge</a>, the "largest crowd ever to assemble in Australia to that date".

After <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> it was felt necessary to add to the Shrine an element commemorating the Australian war dead of the second great conflict. Once again a competition was run, with A. S. Fall and E. E. Milston as the joint winners. Milston's design was eventually chosen as the one to go ahead, and the result was the World War II Forecourt, a wide expanse of stone in front of the Shrine's north face; the Eternal Flame, a permanent gas flame set just to the west of the north face; and the World War II Memorial, a 12.5-metre-high (41 ft) cenotaph a little further west. The Forecourt replaced a <a href="reflecting%20pool">reflecting pool</a> that had previously stood in front of the Shrine. These enlargements were dedicated by <a href="Elizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth II</a> on 28 February 1954. Australia's involvements in later wars, such as the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>, the <a href="Borneo%20campaign%20%281945%29">Borneo campaign (1945)</a>, the <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Malayan Emergency</a>, the <a href="Indonesian%20Confrontation">Indonesian Confrontation</a> in <a href="North%20Borneo">North Borneo</a> and <a href="Sarawak">Sarawak</a>, the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> and the <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a>, are commemorated by inscriptions.

In 1951 the body of <a href="Thomas%20Blamey">Field Marshal Sir Thomas Blamey</a>, Australia's military commander during World War II, was held at the Shrine for three days for public viewing followed by a State funeral on site. 20,000 people visited the Shrine as he lay in state.

During the Vietnam War the Shrine became a centre of conflict when anti-war demonstrators protested during ANZAC Day services against Australia's involvement in the war. In 1971 the Shrine was defaced when the word was painted in large white letters on the pillars of the north portico.

In 1985 the Remembrance Garden was added beneath the western face of the Shrine to honour those who served during post-World War II conflicts.

Restoration work on the terraces surrounding the Shrine during the 1990s raised once again the possibility of taking advantage of the space under the Shrine: as the Shrine had been built on a hollow artificial hill, the undercroft (although at the time filled with rubble from the construction) provided a large space for development. At a planned cost of $5.5 million, the new development was intended to provide a visitor's centre, administration facilities and an improved access to the Shrine's crypt, as many of the remaining veterans and their families found the stairs at the traditional ceremonial entrance difficult to climb. In redeveloping the site, special consideration was given to the positioning of the new entrance. The original plan was to use a tunnel from the east, but this was discarded as it had "no sense of ceremony". Instead it was decided to develop two new courtyards, and place the new gallery under the northern steps. Construction commenced in 2002, with the design by Melbourne architects <a href="Ashton%20Raggatt%20McDougall">Ashton Raggatt McDougall</a>, and the new areas were opened in August 2003. The completed project was awarded the Victorian Architecture Medal by the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Institute%20of%20Architects">Royal Australian Institute of Architects</a> in 2004.

After this construction was complete, there were still more calls to further develop the site, and especially to provide facilities for education about the wars. A $62 million proposal was presented in 2006, incorporating a museum and an underground carpark. Designed once again by Ashton Raggatt McDougall, the proposal was opposed by local residents and some council members, and ran into significant funding problems when the Federal Government decided not to provide funding.

In 2012 the Victorian Government announced that $22.5 million would be allocated to redevelop the Shrine’s undercroft and extend it to the south. The new exhibition space, known as the "Galleries of Remembrance", was opened on Remembrance Day in 2014. A lifeboat from the ship <a href="SS%20Devanha">SS "Devanha"</a>, deployed during the <a href="landing%20at%20Anzac%20Cove">landing at Anzac Cove</a> at the start of the <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli Campaign</a> in 1915, is a centrepiece of the new development.

Materials for building the Shrine were sourced from within Australia: the chosen building stone was <a href="granodiorite">granodiorite</a> quarried from <a href="Tynong">Tynong</a>; the internal walls use <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> from <a href="Redesdale%2C%20Victoria">Redesdale</a>; and the black marble columns used stone from <a href="Buchan%2C%20Victoria">Buchan</a>. This raised some concerns when redeveloping the Shrine, as the Tynong <a href="quarry">quarry</a> was no longer in use, and it proved to be prohibitively expensive to reopen the site. Fortunately another quarry in the area was available and was able to provide the necessary stone.

The design of the Shrine is based on the ancient <a href="Mausoleum%20at%20Halicarnassus">Mausoleum at Halicarnassus</a>, one of the <a href="Seven%20Wonders%20of%20the%20Ancient%20World">Seven Wonders of the World</a>, and the <a href="Parthenon">Parthenon</a> in Athens. It is a structure of square plan roofed by a <a href="stepped%20pyramid">stepped pyramid</a> and entered on the north and south through classical <a href="portico">portico</a>s, each of eight fluted <a href="Doric%20order">Doric</a> columns supporting a <a href="pediment">pediment</a> containing sculpture in high relief. The porticos are approached by wide flights of steps which rise in stages to the podium on which the Shrine sits. The east and west facing fronts are marked at the corners by four groups of statuary by <a href="Paul%20Raphael%20Montford">Paul Raphael Montford</a>, representing <a href="Peace">Peace</a>, <a href="Justice">Justice</a>, <a href="Patriotism">Patriotism</a> and <a href="Sacrifice">Sacrifice</a>. The <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a> style and motifs draw on Greek and Assyrian sculpture. The symbolism is <a href="Neo-Classicism">Neo-Classical</a>.

Around the outer stone balustrade that marks the Shrine's external boundary are the 16 stone "battle honours" discs. These represent the battle honours granted by <a href="George%20V%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George V</a> and commemorate Australia's contributions to the following battles: <a href="Landing%20at%20Anzac">Landing at Anzac</a> (Gallipoli), <a href="Battle%20of%20Sari%20Bair">Sari Bair</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Romani">Rumani</a>, <a href="Third%20Battle%20of%20Gaza">Gaza-Beersheba</a>, the North Sea, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cocos">Cocos Islands</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Megiddo%20%281918%29">Megiddo</a>, Damascus, Villers-Bretonneux, <a href="Battle%20of%20Amiens%20%281918%29">Amiens</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Mont%20St.%20Quentin">Mont St Quentin</a>, the <a href="Hindenburg%20Line">Hindenburg Line</a>, <a href="Third%20Battle%20of%20Ypres">Ypres</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Messines%20%281917%29">Messines</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Pozi%C3%A8res">Pozieres</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Arras%20%281917%29">Bullecourt</a>.

Inside the Shrine is the Sanctuary, a high vaulted space entered by four tall portals of Classical design. A simple entablature is carried on sixteen tall fluted <a href="Ionic%20order">Ionic</a> columns and supports a <a href="frieze">frieze</a> with twelve relief panels sculptured by Lyndon Dadswell, depicting the armed services at work and in action during World War I.
At the centre of the Sanctuary is the Stone of Remembrance. This is a <a href="marble">marble</a> stone sunk below the pavement, so that visitors must bow their heads to read the inscription on it:

The inscription is part of a verse from the <a href="Bible">Bible</a> (<a href="John%2015">John 15</a>:13) "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends." The Stone is aligned with an aperture in the roof of the Sanctuary so that a ray of sunlight falls on the word on the Stone of Remembrance at exactly 11 a.m. on 11 November, marking the hour and day of the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany%20%28Compi%C3%A8gne%29">Armistice</a> which ended World War I. Since the introduction of <a href="daylight%20saving">daylight saving</a> in Victoria, the ray of sunlight is no longer in the right place at 11 a.m. A mirror has been installed to direct sunlight onto the Stone at 11 a.m. During the rest of the year, a light is used to simulate the effect.
Monash, with the advice of Professor T. G. Tucker and the assistance of <a href="Bernard%20O%27Dowd">Bernard O'Dowd</a> and Felix Meyer, reworded Phillip Hudson's inscription which appears on the western wall of the Shrine:

This inscription again aroused criticism, according to Taylor, "for having no Christian, (or, indeed, <a href="religion">religious</a>), element", but was considered to fit the Australian tradition of "stoic patriotism".

The inscription on the eastern wall, not written by Monash, reads:

The Sanctuary is surrounded by an <a href="ambulatory">ambulatory</a>, or passage, along which are forty-two bronze caskets containing hand-written, <a href="illuminated%20%28manuscript%29">illuminated</a> Books of Remembrance with the names of every Victorian who enlisted for active service with the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) or <a href="Australian%20Naval%20and%20Military%20Expeditionary%20Force">Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force</a> in World War I or died in camp prior to embarkation.

Beneath the Sanctuary is the <a href="Crypt">Crypt</a> containing a bronze statue of a father and son, representing the two generations who served in the two world wars. Around the walls are panels listing every unit of the AIF, down to <a href="battalion">battalion</a> and <a href="regiment">regiment</a>, along with the colours of their shoulder patch. The Crypt is hung with the standards of various battalions and regiments, listing their battle honours.

Visitors approach the shrine through the Entrance Courtyard, with "Lest We Forget" inscribed on one wall and a quote from former Governor-General <a href="Sir%20William%20Deane">Sir William Deane</a> on the other. The Garden Courtyard, on the same alignment, features the <a href="Legacy%20Australia">Legacy</a> <a href="Olive">Olive</a> Tree and a seating area. Both courtyards are finished in Tynong Granite.

The gallery of Medals has a 40-metre-long (130 ft) wall displaying around 4,000 medals, each symbolically representing 100 Victorians who have served in war and peacekeeping operations, and six who have died. A feature of the gallery is the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> awarded to <a href="Captain%20%28land%20and%20air%29">Captain</a> <a href="Robert%20Cuthbert%20Grieve">Robert Grieve</a> during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Messines%20%281917%29">Battle of Messines</a> in 1917. The Cross was lent to the Shrine by <a href="Wesley%20College%2C%20Melbourne">Wesley College, Melbourne</a>.

The cenotaph is a tall pillar constructed of <a href="Harcourt%2C%20Victoria">Harcourt granite</a>. Inscribed on its surface are the names of the defence forces, together with the theatres of war they served in. Atop the cenotaph is a <a href="basalt">basalt</a> sculpture of six servicemen carrying a <a href="bier">bier</a> with a corpse, draped by the <a href="flag%20of%20Australia">Australian flag</a>. The sculpture symbolises "the debt of the living to the dead". The <a href="Eternal%20Flame">Eternal Flame</a> is placed nearby, representing eternal life. The flame has burned continuously with few interruptions since it was first lit.

At the other side of the forecourt are three flagpoles. The usual arrangement comprises the Australian flag on the left, the <a href="Flag%20of%20Victoria">Victorian flag</a> in the middle and one of the flags of the three defence forces on the right. Other flags may be flown on special occasions, arranged according to strict protocols.

The Remembrance Garden features a pool, <a href="waterfall">waterfall</a> and Harcourt granite wall bearing the names of the conflicts and peacekeeping operations in which Australia participated following World War II, such as <a href="Kuwait">Kuwait</a> (<a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a>) and <a href="East%20Timor">East Timor</a>.

Although the original architects had proposed including four statues of war leaders, Monash rejected this plan. Instead there were to be no statues representing individual members of the <a href="Australian%20Defence%20Force">Australian Defence Force</a> at the shrine itself, although a number of statues were to be added in the surrounding parklands. The first of these was "The Man With The Donkey", representing <a href="John%20Simpson%20Kirkpatrick">John Simpson Kirkpatrick</a>, although he was not named on the statue. Officially the work is said to represent the "valour and compassion of the Australian soldier". The statue, by Wallace Anderson, was installed in 1936 on the initiative of women who had funded a "Mother's Tribute". A statue of Monash was also commissioned and was designed by <a href="William%20Leslie%20Bowles">Leslie Bowles</a>. Casting was due to begin in 1938, but the onset of World War II delayed work, and thus it was not installed until 1950, and, as with Simpson and his donkey, was located away from the shrine.

The Shrine is set in a large expanse of parkland officially called <a href="Kings%20Domain%2C%20Melbourne">Kings Domain</a>. Over the years many other war memorials have been built in this area, including the Australian-Hellenic Memorial to Australian and Greek dead in the Battles of Greece and <a href="Crete">Crete</a> in 1941, and statues of Monash and Blamey. Most of the trees which line the approaches to the Shrine bear plaques commemorating individual <a href="Australian%20Army">Army</a> units, naval vessels or <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Air Force</a> squadrons, placed there by veterans' groups. An older memorial to Victorians killed in the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a> of 1899–1902 is also located nearby on the corner of St Kilda and Domain Roads.
The Driver and Wipers Memorial, also in the Shrine reserve, commemorates the thousands of Australian lives lost during the fighting at <a href="Battle%20of%20Passchendaele">Ypres</a>; "Wipers" is the way servicemen pronounced "Ypres" during World War I. The bronze soldiers are the work of the British sculptor <a href="Charles%20Sargeant%20Jagger">Charles Sargeant Jagger</a> and originally stood outside the Museum and <a href="State%20Library%20of%20Victoria">State Library of Victoria</a> in Melbourne. They were transferred to the Shrine in 1998. The Driver is a soldier holding a horse whip and bridles, wearing breeches, a protective legging, spurs, and a steel helmet. The figure is a recasting of one of the figures from the <a href="Royal%20Artillery%20Memorial">Royal Artillery Memorial</a> in Hyde Park, London, UK. The other bronze, the "Wipers" figure, is a British infantry soldier standing guard with standard issue .303 rifle, bayonet fixed, a German helmet at his feet. This too is a recasting, taken from the <a href="Hoylake%20and%20West%20Kirby%20War%20Memorial">Hoylake and West Kirby War Memorial</a> in Merseyside, UK.

On 19 July 2008, being the 92nd anniversary of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fromelles">Battle of Fromelles</a>, a replica of the 1998 sculpture by <a href="Peter%20Corlett">Peter Corlett</a> in the <a href="Australian%20Memorial%20Park">Australian Memorial Park</a>, Fromelles was unveiled. This depicts Sergeant Simon Fraser, 57th Battalion, (a farmer from <a href="Byaduk%2C%20Victoria">Byaduk, Victoria</a>), rescuing a wounded compatriot from "<a href="no%20man%27s%20land">no man's land</a>" after the battle.

Near to the Shrine entrance is the Legacy Garden of Appreciation, which was established in 1978. This cross-shaped garden is outlined by hedges. Red <a href="Flanders%20Poppy">Flanders Poppies</a>, planted from seed originating from <a href="Villers-Bretonneux">Villers-Bretonneux</a> in France, flower in late spring. A sculpture by Louis Laumen, "Widow and Children", was commissioned to mark the 75th anniversary of <a href="Legacy%20Australia">Legacy Australia</a> in 1998. The Women's Garden, to the north of the shrine, incorporates concrete memorial violets within a grove of <a href="Jacaranda%20mimosifolia">jacarandas</a>. The focus of the garden is The Ex-Servicewomen’s Memorial Cairn (1985) which was relocated from the King's Domain in 2010.

A <a href="Lone%20Pine%20%28tree%29">Lone Pine</a> ("<a href="Pinus%20brutia">Pinus brutia</a>") was planted in 1933 near the north-east corner of the Shrine by <a href="Stanley%20Savige">Lieutenant-General Sir Stanley Savige</a>, founder of Melbourne Legacy at a formal ceremony. It was one of four seedlings planted in Victoria from seeds of a cone brought back from Gallipoli by Sgt. Keith McDowell. The tree was removed in August 2012 having succumbed to disease caused by the fungus "<a href="Diplodia%20pinea">Diplodia pinea</a>". A "grandchild tree" was planted nearby in 2006.

Since its dedication in 1934, the Shrine has been the centre of war commemoration in Melbourne. Although Remembrance Day (11 November) is the official day for commemorating the war dead, it has gradually been eclipsed in the public estimation by ANZAC Day (25 April), which unlike Remembrance Day is a specifically Australian (and <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>) day of commemoration and a public holiday in both nations. ANZAC Day at the Shrine is observed through a number of ceremonies. The first of these is the Dawn Service, an event that attracted a record crowd of more than 35,000 in 2007. This is followed by an official <a href="wreath">wreath</a>-laying service where officials march to the Shrine and lay wreaths in the Sanctuary. Later, the ANZAC Day March approaches the Shrine via St Kilda Road and the forecourt, before being dismissed at the steps and is followed by a commemoration service held between 1:00 and 1:30 p.m.

On Remembrance Day, Victorian leaders and community members gather to commemorate "the sacrifices made by Australians in all wars and conflicts". A minutes silence is observed at 11 a.m. as the Ray of Light illuminates the word LOVE on the Stone of Remembrance.

Throughout the rest of the year, ceremonies and wreath laying services are held by Victorian unit associations and <a href="battalion">battalion</a>s in the Sanctuary, around memorials in the Shrine Reserve and near remembrance trees specific to various associations.

The Shrine is managed by the Shrine of Remembrance Trustees, ten individuals appointed by the Governor in Council, on the advice of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs in the <a href="Victorian%20Government">Victorian Government</a>. The Trustees are responsible for the care, management, maintenance and preservation of the Shrine and Shrine Reserve.

Traditionally, security for the Shrine has been provided by the Shrine Guard, whose members were men with a military background. All of the original twelve members of the Shrine Guard had won bravery medals during World War I. When the Shrine Guard merged with the <a href="Victoria%20Police">Victoria Police</a> Protective Service, some civilians began to serve. During the hours the Shrine is open to the public or in use for any ceremony, they wear a uniform representing an <a href="Australian%20Light%20Horse">Australian Light Horse</a>man of World War I, with Victoria Police Force insignia.

Zong massacre

The "Zong" massacre was the mass killing of more than 130 African <a href="Slavery">slaves</a> by the crew of the British <a href="slave%20ship">slave ship</a> "Zong" on and in the days following 29 November 1781. The Gregson slave-trading syndicate, based in <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, owned the ship and sailed her in the <a href="Atlantic%20slave%20trade">Atlantic slave trade</a>. As was common business practice, they had taken out insurance on the lives of the slaves as cargo. When the ship ran low on drinking water following navigational mistakes, the crew threw slaves overboard into the sea to drown, in part to ensure the survival of the rest of the ship's passengers, and in part to cash in on the insurance on the slaves, thus not losing money on the slaves who would have died from the lack of water.

After the slave ship reached port at <a href="Black%20River%2C%20Jamaica">Black River, Jamaica</a>, "Zong"s owners made a claim to their insurers for the loss of the slaves. When the insurers refused to pay, the resulting court cases ("Gregson v Gilbert" (1783) 3 Doug. KB 232) held that in some circumstances, the deliberate killing of slaves was legal and that insurers could be required to pay for the slaves' deaths. The judge, <a href="William%20Murray%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Mansfield">Lord Chief Justice, the Earl of Mansfield</a>, ruled against the syndicate owners in this case, due to new evidence being introduced suggesting the captain and crew were at fault.

Following the first trial, freed slave <a href="Olaudah%20Equiano">Olaudah Equiano</a> brought news of the massacre to the attention of the anti-slavery campaigner <a href="Granville%20Sharp">Granville Sharp</a>, who worked unsuccessfully to have the ship's crew prosecuted for murder. Because of the legal dispute, reports of the massacre received increased publicity, stimulating the <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">abolitionist</a> movement in the late 18th and early 19th centuries; the "Zong" events were increasingly cited as a powerful symbol of the horrors of the <a href="Middle%20Passage">Middle Passage</a> of slaves to the New World.

The non-denominational <a href="Society%20for%20Effecting%20the%20Abolition%20of%20the%20Slave%20Trade">Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade</a> was founded in 1787. The next year <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament</a> passed the <a href="Slave%20Trade%20Act%201788">Slave Trade Act 1788</a>, its first law regulating the slave trade, to limit the number of slaves per ship. Then, in 1791, Parliament prohibited insurance companies from reimbursing ship owners when slaves were thrown overboard. The massacre has also inspired works of art and literature. It was commemorated in London in 2007, among events to mark the bicentenary of the British <a href="Slave%20Trade%20Act%201807">Slave Trade Act 1807</a>, which abolished British participation in the African slave trade, though not slavery itself. A monument to the murdered slaves on "Zong" was installed at Black River, Jamaica, their intended port.

"Zong" was originally named "Zorg" (meaning "Care" in <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a>) by its owners, the <a href="Middelburgsche%20Commercie%20Compagnie">Middelburgsche Commercie Compagnie</a>. It operated as a slave ship based in <a href="Middelburg">Middelburg</a>, <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, and made a voyage in 1777, delivering slaves to the coast of <a href="Suriname">Suriname</a>, South America. "Zong" was a "square stern ship" of 110 <a href="Builder%27s%20Old%20Measurement">tons burthen</a>. The <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> 16-gun brig captured her on 10 February 1781. On 26 February, "Alert" and "Zong" arrived at <a href="Cape%20Coast%20Castle">Cape Coast Castle</a>, in what is present-day <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a>. Cape Coast Castle was maintained and staffed, along with other forts and castles, by the <a href="Royal%20African%20Company">Royal African Company</a> (RAC), which used the Castle as its regional headquarters.

In early March 1781, the master of "William" purchased "Zong" on behalf of a syndicate of Liverpool merchants. The members of the syndicate were: Edward Wilson; George Case; James Aspinall; and William, James, and John Gregson. William Gregson had an interest in 50 slaving voyages between 1747 and 1780; he also served as mayor of Liverpool in 1762. By the end of his life, vessels in which Gregson had a financial stake had carried 58,000 Africans to slavery in the Americas.

"Zong" was paid for with <a href="negotiable%20instrument">bills of exchange</a>, and the 244 slaves already on board were part of the transaction. The ship was not insured until after it started its voyage. The insurers, a syndicate from Liverpool, underwrote the ship and slaves for up to £8,000, approximately half the slaves' potential market value. The remaining risk was borne by the owners.

"Zong" was the first command of Luke Collingwood, formerly the surgeon on the "William". While Collingwood lacked experience in navigation and command, ship's surgeons were typically involved in selecting slaves for purchase in Africa, so their medical expertise supported the determination of "commodity value" for a captive. If the surgeon rejected a captive, that individual suffered "commercial death", being of no value, and was liable to be killed by African handlers. Sometimes these killings happened in the presence of the surgeon. It is likely that Collingwood had already witnessed the mass-killing of slaves. As the historian Jeremy Krikler commented, this may have prepared him psychologically to condone the massacre that took place on the "Zong". "Zong" first mate was James Kelsall, who had also served on the "William".

The vessel's only passenger, Robert Stubbs, was a former captain of slave ships. In early 1780 he was appointed by the African Committee of the Royal African Company as the governor of <a href="Fort%20William%2C%20Ghana">Anomabu</a>, a British fortification near Cape Coast Castle in Ghana. This position made him also vice-president of the RAC Council of the Castle. Due to his ineptitude and enmity incurred with John Roberts, governor of the Castle, Stubbs was forced out of the governorship of Anomabu by the RAC Council after nine months. Witness statements gathered by the African Committee of the RAC accused him of being a semi-literate drunkard who mismanaged the slave-trading activities of the fort. Stubbs was aboard to return to Britain; Collingwood may have thought his earlier experience on slave ships would be useful.

"Zong" had a 17-man crew when it left Africa, which was far too small to maintain adequate sanitary conditions on the ship. Mariners willing to risk disease and slave rebellions on slave ships were difficult to recruit within Britain and were harder to find for a vessel captured from the Dutch off the coast of Africa. "Zong" was manned with remnants of the previous Dutch crew, the crew of "William", and with unemployed sailors hired from the settlements along the African coast.

When "Zong" sailed from <a href="Accra">Accra</a> with 442 slaves on 18 August 1781, it had taken on more than twice the number of people that it could safely transport. In the 1780s, British-built ships typically carried 1.75 slaves per ton of the ship's capacity; on the "Zong", the ratio was 4.0 per ton. A British slave ship of the period would carry around 193 slaves and it was extremely unusual for a ship of "Zong" relatively small size to carry so many.

After taking on drinking water at <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Tom%C3%A9%20and%20Pr%C3%ADncipe">São Tomé</a>, "Zong" began its voyage across the Atlantic Ocean to <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> on 6 September. On 18 or 19 November, the ship neared <a href="Tobago">Tobago</a> in the Caribbean but failed to stop there to replenish its water supplies.

It is unclear who, if anyone, was in charge of the ship at this point, as Luke Collingwood had been gravely ill for some time. The man who would normally have replaced him, first mate James Kelsall, had been previously suspended from duty following an argument on 14 November. Robert Stubbs had captained a slave ship several decades earlier and he temporarily commanded "Zong" during Collingwood's incapacitation, but he was not a registered member of the vessel's crew. According to historian James Walvin, the breakdown of the command structure on the ship might explain the subsequent navigational errors and the absence of checks on supplies of drinking water.

On 27 or 28 November, the crew sighted Jamaica at a distance of but misidentified it as the French colony of <a href="Saint-Domingue">Saint-Domingue</a> on the island of <a href="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a>. "Zong" continued on its westward course, leaving Jamaica behind. This mistake was recognised only after the ship was <a href="leeward">leeward</a> of the island. Overcrowding, malnutrition, accidents, and disease had already killed several mariners and approximately 62 Africans. James Kelsall later claimed that there was only four days' water remaining on the ship, when the navigational error was discovered and Jamaica was still 10–13 sailing days away.
If the slaves died onshore, the Liverpool ship-owners would have had no redress from their insurers. Similarly, if the slaves died a "natural death" (as the contemporary term put it) at sea, then insurance could not be claimed. If some slaves were jettisoned in order to save the rest of the "cargo" or the ship, then a claim could be made under "<a href="general%20average">general average</a>". (This principle holds that a captain who jettisons part of his cargo in order to save the rest can claim for the loss from his insurers.) The ship's insurance covered the loss of slaves at £30 a head.

On 29 November, the crew assembled to consider the proposal that some of the slaves should be thrown overboard. James Kelsall later claimed that he had disagreed with the plan at first but it was soon unanimously agreed. On 29 November, 54 women and children were thrown through cabin windows into the sea. On 1 December, 42 male slaves were thrown overboard, and 36 more followed in the next few days. Another ten, in a display of defiance at the inhumanity of the slavers, jumped into the sea. Having heard the shrieks of the victims as they were thrown into the water, one of the captives requested that the remaining Africans be denied all food and drink rather than be thrown into the sea. The crew ignored this request. In total, 142 Africans were killed by the time the ship reached Jamaica. The account of the King's Bench trial reports that one slave managed to climb back onto the ship.

The crew claimed that the slaves had been jettisoned because the ship did not have enough water to keep all the slaves alive for the rest of the voyage. This claim was later disputed, as the ship had of water left when it arrived in Jamaica on 22 December. An affidavit later made by Kelsall stated that on 1 December, when 42 slaves were killed, it rained heavily for more than a day, allowing six casks of water (sufficient for eleven days) to be collected.

On 22 December 1781, "Zong" arrived at <a href="Black%20River%2C%20Jamaica">Black River</a>, Jamaica, with 208 slaves on board, less than half the number taken from Africa. These sold for an average price of £36 each. The Jamaican Vice-Admiralty court upheld the legality of the British capture of "Zong" from the Dutch, and the syndicate renamed the ship "Richard of Jamaica". Luke Collingwood died three days after "Zong" reached Jamaica, two years before the 1783 court proceedings about the case.

When the news of "Zong" voyage reached Great Britain, the ship's owners claimed compensation from their insurers for the loss of the slaves. The insurers refused to honour the claim and the owners took them to court. "Zong"s logbook went missing after the ship reached Jamaica, two years before the hearings started. The legal proceedings provide almost all the documentary evidence about the massacre but there is no formal record of the first trial other than what is referred to in the appeals hearing. The ship's insurers claimed that the log had been deliberately destroyed, which the Gregson syndicate denied.

Almost all the surviving source material is of questionable reliability. The two witnesses who gave evidence, Robert Stubbs and James Kelsall, were strongly motivated to exonerate themselves from blame. It is possible that the figures concerning the number of slaves killed, the amount of water that remained on the ship, and the distance beyond Jamaica that "Zong" had mistakenly sailed are inaccurate.

Legal proceedings began when the insurers refused to compensate the owners of "Zong". The dispute was initially tried at the <a href="Guildhall%2C%20London">Guildhall</a> in London on 6 March 1783, with the <a href="Lord%20Chief%20Justice">Lord Chief Justice</a>, the <a href="William%20Murray%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Mansfield">Earl of Mansfield</a>, overseeing the trial before a jury. Mansfield was previously the judge in <a href="Somersett%27s%20Case">Somersett's Case</a> in 1772, which concerned the legality of keeping slaves in Britain. He had ruled that slavery had never been established by statute in Britain and was not supported by <a href="common%20law">common law</a>.

Robert Stubbs was the only witness in the first "Zong" trial and the jury found in favour of the owners, under an established protocol in maritime insurance that considered slaves as cargo. On 19 March 1783, <a href="Olaudah%20Equiano">Olaudah Equiano</a>, a freed slave, told the anti-slave-trade activist <a href="Granville%20Sharp">Granville Sharp</a> of the events aboard "Zong" and a newspaper soon carried a lengthy account, reporting that the captain had ordered the slaves killed in three batches. Sharp sought legal advice the next day, about the possibility of prosecuting the crew for murder.

The insurers applied to the Earl of Mansfield to have the previous verdict set aside and for the case to be tried again. A hearing was held at the <a href="Court%20of%20King%27s%20Bench%20%28England%29">Court of King's Bench</a> in <a href="Westminster%20Hall">Westminster Hall</a> on 21–22 May 1783, before Mansfield and two other King's Bench judges, <a href="Sir%20Francis%20Buller%2C%201st%20Baronet">Mr Justice Buller</a> and <a href="Edward%20Willes%20%281723%E2%80%931787%29">Mr Justice Willes</a>. The <a href="Solicitor%20General%20for%20England%20and%20Wales">Solicitor General</a>, <a href="John%20Lee%20%28Attorney-General%29">John Lee</a>, appeared on behalf of the "Zong" owners, as he had done previously in the Guildhall trial. Granville Sharp was also in attendance, together with a secretary he had hired to take a written record of the proceedings.

Summing up the verdict reached in the first trial, Mansfield said that the jury:

had no doubt (though it shocks one very much) that the Case of Slaves was the same as if Horses had been thrown over board ... The Question was, whether there was not an Absolute Necessity for throwing them over board to save the rest, [and] the Jury were of opinion there was ...

Collingwood had died in 1781 and the only witness of the massacre to appear at Westminster Hall was passenger Robert Stubbs, although a written affidavit by first mate James Kelsall was made available to the lawyers. Stubbs claimed that there was "an absolute Necessity for throwing over the Negroes", because the crew feared all the slaves would die if they did not throw some into the sea. The insurers argued that Collingwood had made "a Blunder and Mistake" in sailing beyond Jamaica and that the slaves had been killed so their owners could claim compensation. They alleged that Collingwood did this because he did not want his first voyage as a slave ship captain to be unprofitable.

John Lee responded by saying that the slaves "perished just as a Cargo of Goods perished" and were jettisoned for the greater good of the ship. The insurers' legal team replied that Lee's argument could never justify the killing of innocent people; each of the three addressed issues of humanity in the treatment of the slaves and said that the actions of "Zong" crew were nothing less than murder. As historian James Walvin has argued, it is possible that Granville Sharp directly influenced the strategy of the insurers' legal team.

At the hearing, new evidence was heard, that heavy rain had fallen on the ship on the second day of the killings, but a third batch of slaves was killed after that. This led Mansfield to order another trial, because the rainfall meant that the killing of those slaves, after the water shortage had been eased, could not be justified in terms of the greater necessity of saving the ship and the rest of its human cargo. One of the justices in attendance also said that this evidence invalidated the findings of the jury in the first trial, as the jury had heard testimony that the water shortage resulted from the poor condition of the ship, brought on by unforeseen maritime conditions, rather than from errors committed by its captain. Mansfield concluded that the insurers were not liable for losses resulting from errors committed by "Zong" crew.

There is no evidence that another trial was held on this issue. Despite Granville Sharp's efforts, no member of the crew was prosecuted for murder of the slaves. Yet, the "Zong" case did eventually gain both national and international attention. A summary of the appeal on the "Zong" case, was eventually published in the <a href="nominate%20reports">nominate reports</a> prepared from the contemporaneous manuscript notes of <a href="Sylvester%20Douglas%2C%201st%20Baron%20Glenbervie">Sylvester Douglas, Baron Glenbervie</a>, and others. It was published in 1831 as "Gregson v Gilbert" (1783) 3 Doug. KB 232.

Jeremy Krikler has argued that Mansfield wanted to ensure that commercial law remained as helpful to Britain's overseas trade as possible and as a consequence was keen to uphold the principle of "general average", even in relation to the killing of humans. For Mansfield to have found in favour of the insurers would have greatly undermined this idea. The revelation that rain had fallen during the period of the killings enabled Mansfield to order a retrial, while leaving the notion of "general average" intact. He emphasised that the massacre would have been legally justified and the owners' insurance claim would have been valid, if the water shortage had not arisen from mistakes made by the captain.

Krikler comments that Mansfield's conclusions ignored the ruling precedent of his predecessor, <a href="Matthew%20Hale%20%28jurist%29">Matthew Hale</a>, that the killing of innocents in the name of self-preservation was unlawful. This ruling was to prove important a century later in "<a href="R%20v%20Dudley%20and%20Stephens">R v Dudley and Stephens</a>", which also concerned the justifiability of acts of murder at sea. Mansfield also failed to acknowledge another important legal principle—that no insurance claim can be legal if it arose from an illegal act.

Granville Sharp campaigned to raise awareness of the massacre, writing letters to newspapers, the <a href="Lords%20Commissioners%20of%20Admiralty">Lords Commissioners of Admiralty</a> and the Prime Minister (the <a href="William%20Cavendish-Bentinck%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Portland">Duke of Portland</a>). Neither Portland nor the Admiralty sent him a reply. Only a single London newspaper reported the first "Zong" trial in March 1783, but it provided details of events. The newspaper article in March 1783 was the first public report of the massacre, and it was published nearly 18 months after the event. Little else about the massacre appeared in print before 1787.

Despite these setbacks, Sharp's efforts did have some success. In April 1783, he sent an account of the massacre to <a href="William%20Dillwyn">William Dillwyn</a>, a Quaker, who had asked to see evidence that was critical of the slave trade. The <a href="Britain%20Yearly%20Meeting">London Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends</a> decided shortly after to begin campaigning against slavery, and a petition signed by 273 Quakers was submitted to parliament in July 1783. Sharp also sent letters to Anglican bishops and clergy and to those already sympathetic to the abolitionist cause.

The immediate effect of the "Zong" massacre on public opinion was limited, demonstrating—as the historian of abolitionism <a href="Seymour%20Drescher">Seymour Drescher</a> has noted—the challenge that the early abolitionists faced. Following Sharp's efforts, the "Zong" massacre became an important topic in abolitionist literature and the massacre was discussed in works by <a href="Thomas%20Clarkson%20%28abolitionist%29">Thomas Clarkson</a>, <a href="Ottobah%20Cugoano">Ottobah Cugoano</a>, <a href="James%20Ramsay%20%28abolitionist%29">James Ramsay</a> and <a href="John%20Newton">John Newton</a>. These accounts often omitted the names of the ship and its captain, thereby creating, in the words of Srividhya Swaminathan, "a portrait of abuse that could be mapped onto any ship in the Middle Passage".

The "Zong" killings offered a powerful example of the horrors of the slave trade, stimulating the development of the abolitionist movement in Britain, which dramatically expanded in size and influence in the late 1780s. In 1787, the <a href="Society%20for%20the%20Abolition%20of%20the%20Slave%20Trade">Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade</a> was founded.

Parliament received numerous petitions against the slave trade and examined the issue in 1788. With strong support by <a href="Sir%20William%20Dolben%2C%203rd%20Baronet">Sir William Dolben</a>, who had toured a slave ship, it passed the <a href="Slave%20Trade%20Act%201788">Slave Trade Act 1788</a> (Dolben's Act), which was its first legislation to regulate the slave trade. It restricted the number of slaves that could be transported, to reduce problems of overcrowding and poor sanitation. Its renewal in 1794 included an amendment that limited the scope of insurance policies concerning slaves, rendering illegal such generalised phrases that promised to insure against "all other Perils, Losses, and Misfortunes." (The "Zong" owners' representatives had highlighted such a phrase in seeking their claim at the King's Bench hearing.) The act had to be renewed annually and Dolben led these efforts, speaking frequently to parliament in opposition to slavery. The Slave Trade Act of 1799 was passed to make these provisions permanent.

Abolitionists, notably <a href="William%20Wilberforce">William Wilberforce</a>, continued their effort to end the slave trade. Britain passed the <a href="Slave%20Trade%20Act%201807">Slave Trade Act 1807</a>, which prohibited the Atlantic slave trade, and the Royal Navy enforced the <a href="Blockade%20of%20Africa">Blockade of Africa</a>. The United States also prohibited the Atlantic slave trade in 1808 and helped intercept illegal slave ships at sea, predominately after 1842.

In 1823, the <a href="Anti-Slavery%20Society">Anti-Slavery Society</a> was founded in Britain, dedicated to abolishing slavery throughout the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>; the <a href="Slavery%20Abolition%20Act%201833">Slavery Abolition Act 1833</a> represented the achievement of their goal. The "Zong" massacre was frequently cited in abolitionist literature in the 19th century; in 1839, Thomas Clarkson published his "History of the Rise, Progress, and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the African Slave Trade", which included an account of killings.

Clarkson's book had an important influence on the artist <a href="J.%20M.%20W.%20Turner">J. M. W. Turner</a>, who displayed a painting at the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20summer%20exhibition">Royal Academy summer exhibition</a> in 1840 entitled "<a href="The%20Slave%20Ship">The Slave Ship</a>". The painting depicts a vessel from which a number of manacled slaves have been thrown into the sea, to be devoured by sharks. Some of the details in the painting, such as the <a href="Legcuffs">shackles</a> worn by the slaves, appear to have been influenced by the illustrations in Clarkson's book. The painting was shown at an important time in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide, as the Royal Academy exhibition opened one month before the first <a href="World%20Anti-Slavery%20Convention">World Anti-Slavery Convention</a> in London. The painting was admired by its owner, <a href="John%20Ruskin">John Ruskin</a>. It has been described by the 20th-century critic Marcus Wood as one of the few truly great depictions in Western art of the Atlantic slave trade.

The "Zong" massacre has inspired several works of literature. <a href="Fred%20D%27Aguiar">Fred D'Aguiar</a>'s novel "<a href="Feeding%20the%20Ghosts">Feeding the Ghosts</a>" (1997) tells the story of an African who survives being thrown overboard from the "Zong". In the novel, the journal of the slave—Mintah—is lost, unlike that of Granville Sharp. According to the cultural historian Anita Rupprecht, this signifies the silencing of African voices about the massacre.

<a href="M.%20NourbeSe%20Philip">M. NourbeSe Philip</a>'s 2008 book of poems, "Zong!", is based on the events surrounding the massacre and uses the account of the King's Bench hearing as its primary material. Philip's text physically deconstructs the account as a method for undermining the document's authority.

<a href="Margaret%20Busby">Margaret Busby</a>'s play "An African Cargo", staged by Nitro theatre company at <a href="Greenwich%20Theatre">Greenwich Theatre</a> in 2007, dealt with the massacre and the 1783 trials, making use of the legal transcripts.

An episode of the television programme "<a href="Garrow%27s%20Law">Garrow's Law</a>" (2010) is loosely based on the legal events arising from the massacre. The historical <a href="William%20Garrow">William Garrow</a> did not take part in the case, and because the "Zong" captain died shortly after arriving in Jamaica, his appearance in court for fraud is also fictional.

A new play, "The Meaning of Zong", being developed by <a href="Giles%20Terera">Giles Terera</a>, also deals with the massacre and the 1783 trails. Jointly commissioned by the <a href="Royal%20National%20Theatre">Royal National Theatre</a> and presented and developed with partner theatres in Liverpool, Glasgow and London, a number of workshop performances and discussions will be staged in Autumn 2018, ahead of the play being fully staged in 2019.

In 2007, a memorial stone was erected at <a href="Black%20River%2C%20Jamaica">Black River, Jamaica</a>, near where "Zong" would have landed. A sailing ship representing "Zong" was sailed to <a href="Tower%20Bridge">Tower Bridge</a> in London in March 2007 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the <a href="Slave%20Trade%20Act%201807">Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade</a>, at a cost of £300,000. The vessel housed depictions of the "Zong" massacre and the slave trade. It was accompanied by <a href="HMS%20Northumberland%20%28F238%29">HMS "Northumberland"</a>, with an exhibition on board commemorating the role of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> after 1807 in the suppression of the slave trade.

The Man Trap

"The Man Trap" is the premiere of the American <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> television series, "". Written by <a href="George%20Clayton%20Johnson">George Clayton Johnson</a> and directed by <a href="Marc%20Daniels">Marc Daniels</a>, it first aired on September 8, 1966.

In the episode, the crew visit an outpost to conduct medical exams on the residents, only to be attacked by a <a href="shapeshifting">shapeshifting</a> alien creature seeking to extract salt from their bodies.

This was the first "Star Trek" episode to air on television, although the sixth to be filmed; chosen as the first of the series to be broadcast by the studio due to the horror-based plot. "The Man Trap" placed first in the timeslot with a <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen rating</a> of 25.2 percent for the first half-hour and 24.2 for the remainder. It aired two days earlier on Canadian network <a href="CTV%20Television%20Network">CTV</a>.

The starship <a href="USS%20Enterprise%20%28NCC-1701%29">USS "Enterprise"</a> arrives at planet M-113 to provide medical exams for Professor Robert Crater (<a href="Alfred%20Ryder">Alfred Ryder</a>) and his wife Nancy (<a href="Jeanne%20Bal">Jeanne Bal</a>), who operate a research station there. Captain <a href="James%20T.%20Kirk">James T. Kirk</a> (<a href="William%20Shatner">William Shatner</a>), Chief Medical Officer Dr. <a href="Leonard%20McCoy">Leonard McCoy</a> (<a href="DeForest%20Kelley">DeForest Kelley</a>), and Crewman Darnell (<a href="Michael%20Zaslow">Michael Zaslow</a>) <a href="transporter%20%28Star%20Trek%29">transport</a> to the surface as Kirk teases McCoy about his affection for Nancy Crater ten years earlier. They arrive in the research station, and each of the three men see Nancy differently: McCoy as she was when he first met her, Kirk as she should look accounting for her age, and Darnell as a totally different, attractive younger woman. Kirk sends the dazed Darnell outside; when Nancy goes out to fetch her husband, she beckons Darnell to follow her.

When Professor Crater arrives, he is reluctant to be examined, telling Kirk that they only require salt tablets. Before McCoy can complete the examination, they hear a scream from outside. They find Darnell dead, with red ring-like mottling on his face and a plant root visible in his mouth; Nancy says that she was unable to stop Darnell from tasting the plant. On board "Enterprise", <a href="Spock">Spock</a> (<a href="Leonard%20Nimoy">Leonard Nimoy</a>) analyzes the plant. He confirms that it is poisonous, but the mottling is not a symptom. McCoy conducts a medical exam, and together with Spock determines that Darnell died after all the salt was drained from his body. In response, Kirk transports back down to the planet with McCoy and two crewmen, Green (Bruce Watson) and Sturgeon (John Arndt). They spread out to search, but Crater slips away. Kirk and McCoy find Sturgeon's body. Meanwhile, unseen by them, Nancy has killed Green; the faces of Green and Sturgeon show the same mottling as Darnell. Nancy alters her shape, assuming the form of Green, and meets Kirk and McCoy. They beam back up to the ship with Sturgeon's body.

"Green" roams the corridors, first following Yeoman <a href="Janice%20Rand">Janice Rand</a> (<a href="Grace%20Lee%20Whitney">Grace Lee Whitney</a>) into the botanical laboratory as she brings Lieutenant <a href="Hikaru%20Sulu">Sulu</a> (<a href="George%20Takei">George Takei</a>) his lunch with a salt shaker. A plant in the lab shrieks and shrinks in fear at the entrance of the creature, causing alarm. The creature then moves on, attacking several crew members, killing one. It then shape-shifts into the form of McCoy. Meanwhile, Spock confirms that scans show only one person, Crater, on the planet; Kirk and Spock beam down to capture him. They find Green's body before Crater tries to frighten them away with <a href="Weapons%20in%20Star%20Trek%23Phaser">phaser</a> fire. After they stun him with a phaser beam, the dazed Crater reveals that his real wife was killed by the creature – the last member of a long-dead civilization of shape-shifters who feed on salt – a year earlier. The creature continues to take on the appearance of Nancy out of affection for Crater, and he has been feeding it. Kirk informs "Enterprise" of the creature's intrusion, as the landing party and Crater transport back to the ship.

Crater refuses to help them identify the creature, so Kirk orders the fake "McCoy" to administer truth serum. Kirk arrives in sickbay to find Crater dead and Spock injured; Spock's <a href="Vulcan%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Vulcan</a> blood made him incompatible with the creature's needs. Back in its "Nancy" form, the creature goes to McCoy's quarters. Kirk arrives with a phaser to provoke the creature into attacking. McCoy gets in the way, giving the creature the opportunity to attack Kirk. The creature reverts to its natural appearance and starts to feed on Kirk. McCoy opens fire with his phaser. The creature changes back into the shape of "Nancy" to plead for its life as McCoy continues firing and kills it. As "Enterprise" leaves orbit, Kirk comments, with a degree of compassion, that this creature – the last of its kind – was probably not inherently evil, but simply desperate.

"The Man Trap" appeared in <a href="Gene%20Roddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a>'s original pitch for "Star Trek" as the title of a show with a different plot: the crew face several apparitions that are "wish-fulfilment traps which become as real as flesh and blood"; the traps increase in subtlety until the crew struggle to differentiate between apparition and reality. <a href="Lee%20Erwin%20%28writer%29">Lee Erwin</a>, who had previously worked on "<a href="The%20Lieutenant">The Lieutenant</a>" with Roddenberry, was commissioned to produce a treatment; an outline featuring a salt-devouring <a href="vampire">vampire</a> was handed in on April 8, 1966. Meanwhile, <a href="George%20Clayton%20Johnson">George Clayton Johnson</a> had been assigned a storyline, tentatively titled "Chicago II", in which the crew of the "Enterprise" visit a planet where the culture was that of 1920s <a href="American%20Mafia">mob</a>-era <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>. Johnson was hired after story editor <a href="John%20D.%20F.%20Black">John D. F. Black</a> recommended him to the producers. Johnson decided to use the 1953 science fiction novel "<a href="The%20Syndic">The Syndic</a>" by <a href="Cyril%20M.%20Kornbluth">Cyril M. Kornbluth</a> as the basis for the story. Roddenberry felt that Johnson's treatment did not match his vision for "Star Trek", but did not want to lose him entirely, and asked him to write "The Man Trap". Erwin was paid in full for his version, and given a separate "kill fee" because it would not be used.

Roddenberry wanted to see more action, so the creature's ability to create apparitions was added to the script from the original pitch. Stan Robertson at <a href="NBC">NBC</a> suggested to Roddenberry that they might wish to get medical advice over whether the draining of a chemical from a person would kill them instantly. To find out, Roddenberry asked Kellam de Forest Research, who said that, while it had never happened in reality, a quick death would be likely. Johnson suggested that the creature in "The Man Trap" could be the last of its species. He compared its situation to the reduction in numbers of <a href="American%20bison">American bison</a>. Roddenberry found the idea intriguing.
Erwin was paid a further fee to terminate his contract, and Johnson wrote a first draft teleplay titled "Damsel With a <a href="Hammered%20dulcimer">Dulcimer</a>." While writing, Johnson consulted Black, who advised him to place the creature on the "Enterprise" quickly to increase the pace of the episode. This draft was delivered on May 23, but NBC felt that <a href="hallucination">hallucination</a>s were being overused; the same plot device had appeared in the <a href="pilot%20episode">pilot episode</a> "". Johnson wrote a further draft on May 31, which reduced the number of apparitions, and was well received by <a href="Robert%20H.%20Justman">Robert H. Justman</a>. Roddenberry and Justman made further tweaks; one was to restore the name "The Man Trap" from Erwin's original treatment, another removed a scene which introduced McCoy's apprehension when using the transporter. Johnson further edited the script, but complained about the change in name. After a second edit by Johnson, it was passed from Justman to story editor Black. While the former felt that the script still needed work, Black felt it was nearly ready. Following Black's review, Roddenberry re-wrote the script between June 16 and 21. Johnson felt this re-write had "downgrad[ed] the story."

Black later said that Roddenberry removed a large part of Johnson's work, and that Johnson's original work was better than Roddenberry's edited version. Johnson was pleased with the final episode, although he was concerned that viewers might not understand "Star Trek" after watching "The Man Trap" owing to differences in characterization between this episode and the rest of the series. He admitted that he did not like Spock and was concerned that the character would not be understood after this episode. Roddenberry was pleased with Johnson's work, and offered him further writing work on "<a href="What%20Are%20Little%20Girls%20Made%20Of%3F">What Are Little Girls Made Of?</a>", which had been written by <a href="Robert%20Bloch">Robert Bloch</a>. Roddenberry only wanted Johnson to "polish" the script; Johnson, feeling he was unable to improve it without starting from scratch, turned down the offer, but expressed the desire to work on the show again. He later wrote a story outline titled "Rock-A-Bye Baby, or Die!" in which the "Enterprise" would have become a childlike sentient being who idolizes Kirk as its father. This was not commissioned, so "The Man Trap" was Johnson's only work on the franchise.

Jeanne Bal was cast as Nancy Crater, McCoy's former love interest; the actress had previously guest-starred in "<a href="Perry%20Mason%20%28TV%20series%29">Perry Mason</a>" and was one of the main performers in the <a href="sitcom">sitcom</a> "<a href="Love%20and%20Marriage%20%281959%20TV%20series%29">Love and Marriage</a>". Alfred Ryder was well known for his numerous appearances in similar <a href="Outline%20of%20science%20fiction">genre</a> series such as "<a href="The%20Wild%20Wild%20West">The Wild Wild West</a>" and "<a href="The%20Outer%20Limits%20%281963%20TV%20series%29">The Outer Limits</a>". After his appearance as Robert Crater in "The Man Trap", he appeared in the science fiction series "<a href="The%20Invaders">The Invaders</a>".

Actors playing two of the crewmen who died on screen later appeared in other episodes of "Star Trek". Michael Zaslow, seen in "The Man Trap" as Darnell, appeared in "<a href="I%2C%20Mudd">I, Mudd</a>", and later had a long-running role in the <a href="soap%20opera">soap opera</a> "<a href="Guiding%20Light">Guiding Light</a>" as <a href="Roger%20Thorpe%20and%20Holly%20Norris">Roger Thorpe</a>. John Arndt appeared in four further episodes of the original series.

All previous episodes of "Star Trek" had overrun their filming schedules, and the producers were concerned that not enough time had been allotted to each production. <a href="Marc%20Daniels">Marc Daniels</a> was recruited as director of "The Man Trap"; among his varied directing credits were episodes of "<a href="I%20Love%20Lucy">I Love Lucy</a>" for <a href="Desilu%20Productions">Desilu Productions</a>. Pre-production began during the six scheduled filming days for "", but that episode ran long. Filming for "The Man Trap" commenced around 3:20 p.m. on June 22 and continued until 7:10 p.m. Several futuristic-looking salt shakers were sourced for scenes in "The Man Trap", but due to concerns that they would not be recognized, they were instead used from "The Man Trap" onward as McCoy's tools in sickbay.

The first full day of filming on June 23 was predominantly shot on the set representing the bridge of the "Enterprise". Two small establishing shots were postponed until the filming of the next episode. The following day, corridor scenes were filmed, as was the climactic scene featuring the creature's death. At that point, Daniels estimated that he was only a third of a day behind schedule. After a break for the weekend, production resumed on June 27 for scenes in the botany lab, the briefing room and <a href="sick%20bay">sickbay</a>. One of Grace Lee Whitney's favorite sets to work on throughout the series was the lab, which was the sickbay redecorated, as she enjoyed working with George Takei. The animated plant in that scene was a hand puppet controlled from under the table, and Whitney later recalled that the operator could see right up her skirt throughout the shoot and would occasionally try to grope her using the puppet.

For the sickbay scenes when Spock bleeds, Daniels decided that Vulcans should have green blood. Roddenberry disliked the idea and unsuccessfully attempted to have it corrected in post-production. By the end of the fifth day of shooting, Daniels estimated that he was now only half an hour behind schedule. Days six and seven were spent on the sets used to show the surface of M-113; while the design of the planet did not match Johnson's vision, he was pleased with it nonetheless. The ruins were constructed out of cardboard boxes covered in <a href="Shotcrete">gunite</a> (a spray-on, cement-like product) to give them a rocky appearance. Production wrapped on June 30, at 2:55 p.m. Bob Justman later referred to Daniels as the "savior" of the series for delivering "The Man Trap" on schedule, and when the director for "<a href="The%20Naked%20Time">The Naked Time</a>" dropped out, Daniels took over and shot the episode back to back with "The Man Trap" a quarter of a day faster than the schedule. By the end of the original series, Daniels had filmed more episodes than any other director.

During the production of "The Man Trap", Daniels introduced a system in which actors unneeded on a shoot went to a "cast table" area to practice upcoming scenes rather than return to their dressing rooms. Producers felt that this both sped up the filming process and improved the quality of performances. The cast table system continued to be used throughout the production of the original series, even when Daniels was not directing.

In post-production, Justman recommended adding an opening narration. Roddenberry agreed and wrote new lines for a <a href="logbook">Captain's log</a>. <a href="Alexander%20Courage">Alexander Courage</a> recorded the music for this episode on August 19, the same day as the "<a href="Theme%20from%20Star%20Trek">Theme from "Star Trek"</a>", using a 25-piece orchestra. While Roddenberry liked the theme, he hated the music created specifically for "The Man Trap". The optical effects were created more quickly than usual; <a href="Howard%20A.%20Anderson%2C%20Jr.">Howard A. Anderson, Jr.</a> took two months, three times faster than for some episodes. The overall production costs for "The Man Trap" came in under-budget at $185,401.

The producers spent some time considering the creature's appearance. Justman suggested to Gene Roddenberry that it could be some sort of "terrifying, young lady" with a similar appearance to the green skinned <a href="Orion%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Orion slave girl</a> seen in "The Cage", but blue skinned and with orange hair. While Roddenberry thought that the idea was good, he already had an agreement with NBC that it would be an animal. Johnson envisaged the creature as a refugee with "ashen skin" wearing "<a href="gunny%20sack">gunnysack</a> clothing". Daniels had some apprehension about using a monster-of-the-week format, asking "Do you go for cheap thrills or a more intelligent approach?" He said that the crew decided to "treat everything as if it were real" in order to help the audience buy into it.

It was Johnson who suggested the creature should be a <a href="shapeshifting">shapeshifter</a>, having used the idea in an episode of "<a href="The%20Twilight%20Zone%20%281959%20TV%20series%29">The Twilight Zone</a>" he wrote called "<a href="The%20Four%20of%20Us%20Are%20Dying">The Four of Us Are Dying</a>". The creature was designed by <a href="Wah%20Chang">Wah Chang</a>, and dancer Sandra Gimpel wore the costume on-screen. She had previously appeared as a Talosian in "The Cage". The head of the creature costume was sculpted in clay then covered in a plaster cast. Once the cast was removed, <a href="liquid%20latex">liquid latex</a> was applied to create a flexible single-piece mask, which was then painted. Chang added a white wig and attached glass lenses to the mask for eyes. Once Gimpel was wearing the mask, cuts were made into its wrinkles to offer the actress some limited vision while wearing it. Gloves were modified by Chang to give the fingers the appearance of tentacles with suction cups. <a href="William%20Ware%20Theiss">William Ware Theiss</a> created the rest of the costume out of a fur bodysuit.

Johnson praised both Chang and Gimpel, saying that while the latter embodied the character, the design work meant that, in the final scene, it was as if the crew had to kill a "helpless dog". After filming, the costume was kept in Justman's office, becoming the first in an ever-growing number of alien costumes accumulated there. It reappeared on-screen in "<a href="The%20Squire%20of%20Gothos">The Squire of Gothos</a>". Although referred to officially as the "M-113 creature", during production it was called the "salt sucker" and <a href="trekkie">fans of the show</a> have taken to referring to the alien as the "salt vampire".

Don Lanning was part of the team working on the creature effects for the 2009 film "<a href="Star%20Trek%20%28film%29">Star Trek</a>". He was the key sculptor for the production, and personally revamped some of the aliens from the original series, including the salt vampire seen in "The Man Trap". He described the original design as "hokey", and said that he tried to change it to "something organic". The new version of the creature was unused in the film, which pleased Lanning. The creature did return in "<a href="Star%20Trek%20Online">Star Trek Online</a>", a <a href="massively%20multiplayer%20online%20role-playing%20game">massively multiplayer online role-playing game</a>. Rather than a single salt vampire, the 20-player <a href="Player%20versus%20environment">PvE</a> mission "Mine Trap" saw a <a href="Romulan">Romulan</a> colony overrun with them.

In his book "The Influence of Star Trek on Television, Film and Culture", Lincoln Geraghty wrote that episodes such as "The Man Trap" demonstrated a recurring theme within the series: the more barren the planet, the more likely that characters will be in danger. Other episodes which he said supported this view included "The Cage" and "What Are Little Girls Made Of?". Geraghty also pointed out that elsewhere in the original series, the predominant view was that alien predators such as the salt vampire were a lower life form which should be destroyed. He said that in "The Man Trap", the alternative argument is presented: that such creatures should not be killed. However, Geraghty felt that the writers tried to prevent viewers from feeling sympathy for the creature by revealing its true appearance as it died. Paula M. Block and Terry J. Erdmann also discussed the killing of the creature in their book "Star Trek: The Original Series 365", saying that it was "the right thing to do", but suggested that the nature of the death would have troubled McCoy for some time after the event although this was not shown in the series.

A vampiric alien is a recurring idea in science fiction television series, such as the "<a href="Blake%27s%207">Blake's 7</a>" episode "Sand", the "<a href="Babylon%205">Babylon 5</a>" episode "<a href="Soul%20Hunter%20%28Babylon%205%29">Soul Hunter</a>" and the <a href="television%20film">television film</a> "". The theme had already been used in written form, in <a href="Gustave%20Le%20Rouge">Gustave Le Rouge</a>'s 1908 <a href="French%20science%20fiction">French science fiction</a> work "Le Prisonnier de la Planète Mars".

Block and Erdmann also discussed another part of the episode where Spock is in charge on the bridge and <a href="Uhura">Uhura</a> begins to flirt with him, calling it a "quintessential scene of the series" due to the characters' sexual interest in each other. They suggested this may have been the inspiration for the Spock/Uhura relationship introduced in the 2009 <a href="Reboot%20%28fiction%29">reboot</a> film "Star Trek". <a href="Nichelle%20Nichols">Nichelle Nichols</a>, who played Uhura, later said that she felt there were hints of an Uhura/Spock relationship in other episodes of the original series.

A month prior to the premiere of "Star Trek", Desilu held a screening for NBC executives to help decide which episode to broadcast first, and several stories were considered. Executives were concerned that "<a href="Mudd%27s%20Women">Mudd's Women</a>", one potential choice, would have reviewers discussing "space hookers"; they felt another possibility, "<a href="Where%20No%20Man%20Has%20Gone%20Before">Where No Man Has Gone Before</a>", contained too much exposition, even though it was filmed as a second pilot. The final choice was between "The Man Trap" and "<a href="The%20Naked%20Time">The Naked Time</a>". Justman felt that "The Naked Time" would make it easier for viewers to understand the characters, but later agreed with NBC's decision to show "The Man Trap" first. In the book "Inside Star Trek: The Real Story", he suggests that it was "scarier and more exploitable than the others".

"The Man Trap" was the sixth episode produced. Although Roddenberry initially disagreed with NBC's decision, he and production executive <a href="Herbert%20Franklin%20Solow">Herbert Franklin Solow</a> came to believe it was the correct choice. Shatner also disagreed with the network, feeling that "The Man Trap" was the worst episode out of those available. The episode was the first episode of "Star Trek" broadcast in the United States, on NBC on September 8, 1966. "The Man Trap" formed part of NBC's "Sneak a Peak Week", in which the network showed the premiere episodes of several new shows in prime time slots, ahead of the rival channels <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> and <a href="CBS">CBS</a>, who were still showing repeats from the previous season. Leading into "Star Trek" was the first episode of "<a href="Tarzan%20%281966%20TV%20series%29">Tarzan</a>" showing <a href="Ron%20Ely">Ron Ely</a>, and leading out was <a href="Richard%20Mulligan">Richard Mulligan</a>'s "<a href="The%20Hero%20%281966%20TV%20series%29">The Hero</a>".

"The Man Trap" placed first in its timeslot, with <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen ratings</a> of 25.2 during the first half-hour; some 46.7 percent of all televisions in use at the time were tuned in to the episode. In the same timeslot, "<a href="The%20Tammy%20Grimes%20Show">The Tammy Grimes Show</a>" on ABC and "<a href="My%20Three%20Sons">My Three Sons</a>" on CBS received ratings of 14.1 and 9.4 respectively. During the second half of the episode, the rating for "The Man Trap" dropped to 24.2, with 42.2 percent of televisions tuned in. "<a href="Bewitched">Bewitched</a>" on ABC increased that network's rating to 15.8, and CBS's Thursday night movie increased their rating to 10.7.

The following episodes saw a drop in ratings after "The Man Trap". "<a href="Charlie%20X">Charlie X</a>" was broadcast the following week; the studio did not want that episode to run second, but "Where No Man Has Gone Before" was the only other completed story. It placed second in the timeslot during the first half hour, with a rating of 19.1 and an overall share of 35.9 percent of viewers. It was beaten by "My Three Sons" on CBS with a rating of 19.2. During the second half hour, "Star Trek" was pushed into third with a rating of 12.3 by the Thursday night movie on CBS and the season premiere of "Bewitched", which was also the first episode of that series broadcast in color. The following week, with "Where No Man Has Gone Before", the series returned to the top place with a 19.9 rating during the first half hour, and second in the second half hour to "Bewitched". The Trendex rating report for the first few weeks of "Star Trek" saw it ranked in 33rd spot for the period with an average rating of 18.7.

The episode was not the first to be broadcast in the United Kingdom, which instead premiered "Star Trek" on <a href="BBC%20One">BBC One</a> with "Where No Man Has Gone Before" on July 12, 1969. The episodes continued to be broadcast in a different order than they had appeared in the United States. "The Man Trap" was shown nearly three months later on October 4 as the 13th episode. This was during the period when the channel was still broadcasting only in black and white; it was not until "" on November 15 that the series was shown in color. During subsequent repeats of "Star Trek", the channel reverted to NBC's schedule and showed "The Man Trap" as the first episode. Canadian network <a href="CTV%20Television%20Network">CTV</a> aired episodes of the first season of "Star Trek" on Tuesday nights instead of Thursdays and so ran "The Man Trap" on September 6, 1966, two days before NBC. Airing American programs early was a common practice among Canadian broadcasters in order to avoid direct competition for viewers and advertisers with American border stations airing the same program at the same time. The practice became obsolete once <a href="simultaneous%20substitution">simultaneous substitution</a> of commercials was permitted.

A <a href="High-definition%20television">high-definition</a> remastering of "The Man Trap", which introduced new special effects and starship exteriors as well as enhanced music and audio, was shown for the first time in the United States on September 29, 2007, in <a href="broadcast%20syndication">broadcast syndication</a>. The episode was made available to over 200 local stations across the United States with the rights to broadcast "Star Trek".

In an interview published in the 1988 book "The Star Trek Interview Book", Johnson claimed that the response of critics to "The Man Trap", and the initial episodes of "Star Trek" in general, was "complete bewilderment". In previewing the broadcast of "The Man Trap", "The Daily Reporter" said that "Star Trek" had the "usual far-fetched suppositions" present in other science fiction works, but praise was given to the acting skills of Shatner and the plots of the initial episodes. The "<a href="Edwardsville%20Intelligencer">Edwardsville Intelligencer</a>" called the reveal of the creature in the episode "the kicker of a great sci-fi plot". "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Daily Variety</a>" columnist Jack Hellman gave the episode an unfavorable review over its "lack of meaningful cast leads", who "move around with directorial precision with only violence to provide the excitement." The weekly edition of the magazine offered a similar opinion, stating that the "Enterprise" "trudged along for a long hour with hardly any relief from violence, killing, ugly stuff and a distasteful monster".

Among more recent reviews, Zack Handlen of "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" gave the episode an "A-" rating, describing it as "done very well" with a plot that is dark and ambiguous. Torrie Atkinson and Eugene Myers reviewed the episode in 2009 for <a href="Tor%20Books">Tor.com</a>, saying that it suitably introduced the characters, although certain elements of the show were not yet in place. These included the lack of the death of a <a href="Redshirt%20%28character%29">redshirted character</a>, as the crewmen who died in "The Man Trap" did not wear red shirts, along with the lack of red and yellow alerts, instead referred to as <a href="general%20quarters">general quarters</a> three and four in this episode. The duo added that the episode demonstrated that the series was "something special", and that it remained more culturally diverse than modern television. They gave it a rating of four out of six.

Ryan Britt, also writing for Tor.com, said that "The Man Trap" was not a good introduction to the series, but praised the screen time given to Rand, Uhura and Sulu. He added that the latter two were more interesting in this episode than they would be at any point until the start of the movie franchise. Britt said that "The Man Trap" was different than the rest of the series, and more akin to "The Twilight Zone" owing to the background of the writer. In <a href="Hollywood.com">Hollywood.com</a>'s ranking of all 79 episodes of "The Original Series", Christian Blauvelt placed "The Man Trap" as 73rd, calling the creature "incredibly pointless". It was also listed as one of the show's "cheesiest classic creatures" by "<a href="Wired%20%28magazine%29">Wired</a>" magazine in 2007; however, "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine listed it as the tenth best villain in the franchise.

The first adaptation of "The Man Trap" was as a re-working into a short story by author <a href="James%20Blish">James Blish</a> as part of the novelization "<a href="Star%20Trek%20%28Bantam%20Books%29">Star Trek</a>". This book contained seven short stories, each based on an episode of "The Original Series", and was published in January 1967. The adaptation of "The Man Trap" appeared as the third story in the book, although it was named "The Unreal McCoy". The first home media release of "The Man Trap" was on <a href="Compact%20Cassette">Compact Cassette</a> from Startone productions in 1982. A further release on <a href="LaserDisc">LaserDisc</a> took place in 1985, alongside "Charlie X". Further releases of all episodes of the series were made on <a href="VHS">VHS</a> and <a href="Betamax">Betamax</a>.

The episode was released on <a href="DVD">DVD</a> paired with "The Naked Time" as part of the general release of the series in 1999. There were no other extras added to that series of releases, except the DVD containing "<a href="Turnabout%20Intruder">Turnabout Intruder</a>". "The Man Trap" was later released within a DVD box set of the first season in 2004; all three seasons of "The Original Series" were released as full-season box sets that year. The episode was included in the remastered season one release on DVD and <a href="Blu-ray">Blu-ray</a> in 2009.

Coalhouse Fort

Coalhouse Fort is an artillery fort in the <a href="East%20of%20England">eastern</a> <a href="England">English</a> county of <a href="Essex">Essex</a>. It was built in the 1860s to guard the lower <a href="Thames">Thames</a> from seaborne attack. It stands at Coalhouse Point on the north bank of the river, at a location near <a href="East%20Tilbury">East Tilbury</a> that was vulnerable to raiders and invaders. It was the last in a series of fortifications dating back to the 15th century and was the direct successor to a smaller mid-19th century fort built on the same site. Constructed during a period of tension with France, its location on marshy ground caused problems from the start and led to a lengthy construction process. The fort was equipped with a variety of large-calibre artillery guns and the most modern defensive facilities of the time, including shell-proof <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s protected by granite facing and cast-iron shields. Its lengthy construction and the rapid pace of artillery development at the time meant that it was practically obsolete for its original purpose within a few years of its completion.

The fort's armament was revised several times during its 70 years of <a href="military">military</a> use, as its role evolved in the river's defensive system. It was initially a front-line fortification, supported by <a href="Shornemead%20Fort">Shornemead Fort</a> and <a href="Cliffe%20Fort">Cliffe Fort</a> located to the south and east respectively on the <a href="Kent">Kent</a> shore. Over time, as <a href="Artillery%20battery">batteries</a> and forts further downriver became the front line of the Thames defences, Coalhouse Fort was stripped of its main weapons and it was altered to support smaller quick-firing guns intended to be used against fast-moving surface and aerial targets. Its last military use was as a training facility for a few years after the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>.

Decommissioned in 1949, the fort was used as a storehouse for a shoe factory before it was purchased by the local council. The surrounding land was developed into a public park, but the fort itself fell into dereliction despite its historical and architectural significance. Since 1985 it has been leased to a voluntary preservation group, the Coalhouse Fort Project, which has been working to restore the fort and use it for heritage and educational purposes. It can be visited by the public on regular open days. It houses reconstructions, small military museums and open-air displays of military equipment. Funding for its restoration has been provided in part by the <a href="Heritage%20Lottery%20Fund">Heritage Lottery Fund</a> and the <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> film studio, which used the fort as a location for the opening scenes of the 2005 film "<a href="Batman%20Begins">Batman Begins</a>".

East Tilbury, which stands at the western end of the section of the Thames known as Lower Hope Reach, was fortified long before the building of Coalhouse Fort due to its vulnerability to seaborne attackers. Settlements on both sides of the Thames were raided by the French in 1379 during the <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War%20%281369%E2%80%9389%29">second phase of the Hundred Years' War</a>. The attack prompted the building of <a href="Cooling%20Castle">Cooling Castle</a> on Kent's <a href="Hoo%20Peninsula">Hoo Peninsula</a> between 1380 and 1385 but there was initially no corresponding move to improve the defences of East Tilbury.

Appeals from the local people led to <a href="the%20Crown">the Crown</a> agreeing in July 1402 to build an earthen <a href="Rampart%20%28fortification%29">rampart</a> and towers to protect the settlement. The site of these early defences is not known but might have been near where St Catherine's Church now stands. A ditch of unknown date in that vicinity may represent a fragment of the medieval defences.

<a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a> ordered the construction of an artillery <a href="blockhouse">blockhouse</a> at East Tilbury in 1539–40 as part of <a href="Device%20Forts">a major scheme</a> to fortify the coastline of England and Wales. It followed <a href="English%20Reformation">his break from the Pope and the Catholic Church</a>, which led to fears that the Catholic powers of Europe would seek to invade so as to reimpose Papal authority. Five blockhouses were built along the Thames between Gravesend and Higham – two on the north bank at Tilbury and East Tilbury and three on the south bank at <a href="Gravesend%20Blockhouse">Gravesend</a>, <a href="Milton%20Blockhouse">Milton</a> (near the present <a href="New%20Tavern%20Fort">New Tavern Fort</a>) and Higham.

The East Tilbury Blockhouse was built partly with stone taken from St Margaret's Chapel in Tilbury, which was <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20monasteries">dissolved</a> in 1536. Its form is not known but it probably consisted of a brick and stone structure, perhaps in a D-shape, with a rampart and ditch to enclose its landward side. It was recorded as having fifteen iron and brass cannon of various calibres in 1540; these had been increased to 27 by 1539–40. It had a small permanent garrison, consisting of a commander and his deputy, a porter, two soldiers and four gunners. The blockhouse may have been altered in 1545 but in 1553 it was disarmed. Although the corresponding blockhouse at Gravesend continued in use and that at Tilbury was eventually incorporated into <a href="Tilbury%20Fort">Tilbury Fort</a> between 1670 and 1683, the one at East Tilbury seems to have been abandoned before the end of the 16th century. By 1735 it had been inundated by the river and was in ruins. Its site by the shoreline has since been eroded away by tidal action, though it is possible that remains from the blockhouse may still survive under the river mud.

The June 1687 <a href="Raid%20on%20the%20Medway">Raid on the Medway</a> by the Dutch fleet during the <a href="Second%20Anglo-Dutch%20War">Second Anglo-Dutch War</a> exposed the weaknesses of the Thames defences. It took another hundred years for the defences on Gravesend Reach to be improved, in the form of new works at Gravesend and Tilbury built in the 1780s, but even then the potential of forward defence – to prevent enemies accessing the lower Thames – continued to be neglected. It was not until the outbreak of the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary Wars</a> that the need for effective forward defence was addressed. <a href="Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Lieutenant Colonel</a> Hartcup of the <a href="Royal%20Engineers">Royal Engineers</a> carried out a survey of the Thames in 1794 in which he recommended building a triangle of artillery batteries to guard the entrance to Gravesend Reach and the next reach of the river, Lower Hope Reach. Two of the batteries would be located on the south bank at Shornemead, about north-west of Higham; at Lower Hope Point, about north-west of <a href="Cliffe%2C%20Kent">Cliffe</a>; and on the north bank at East Tilbury, about north of the old Henrician blockhouse. The batteries would have a maximum range of about and their arcs of fire would overlap, enabling them to support each other.

The new battery was constructed during 1799 on marshy ground a short distance south-east of St Catherine's Church. It took its name from the nearby Coalhouse Point, which was named for a coal wharf that once existed there to serve East Tilbury. The soft soil caused many problems but the work was completed by July of that year. It was equipped with four <a href="24-pounder%20long%20gun">24-pounder (pdr.) cannon</a> mounted on traversing carriages, which enabled the gunners to track targets much more easily than had been the case with traditional <a href="Gun%20carriage%23Naval%20or%20garrison%20carriages">garrison carriages</a>. The battery faced the river with a semi-circular earthen rampart on which the guns were mounted. A walled-off area to the rear enclosed a barracks, <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a> and shot kiln (for heating shot to set wooden ships on fire). The whole structure was surrounded by a polygonal water-filled <a href="Ditch%20%28fortification%29">ditch</a>. It was modified in 1810 to raise the height of the rampart and to add a small expense magazine where ammunition was stored for immediate use. The French did not test the Thames defences, despite an invasion scare in 1804, and the battery was abandoned along with those at Lower Hope Point and Shornemead following <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>'s final defeat in 1815.

Renewed tension between Britain and France in the 1840s led to a modernisation of some of Britain's coastal defences. The batteries at Shornemead and Coalhouse Point were reinstated and upgraded, though the one at Lower Hope Point was never restored. In the case of the Coalhouse battery, it was substantially expanded between 1847 and 1855 to convert it into a fort. The work was slow as the marshy ground caused the foundations to crack and the structure to subside, and the contractor was unsatisfactory.

The new fort was built as an extension to the north-west of the existing battery, and thus took an irregular plan. The rampart was extended to accommodate more guns – a total of seventeen 32-pdrs. – and a much enlarged interior replaced the old barracks and magazine. <a href="Caponier">Caponier</a>s at the east side and firing positions on the other sides facilitated musketry defence against land-based assailants. The fort was surrounded by a wide water-filled ditch. A bridge on the west (landward) side provided the only access route.

By the late 1850s, Britain and France were locked in an arms race. A new generation of increasingly accurate and powerful guns had been developed (of the <a href="rifled%20muzzle%20loader">rifled muzzle loader</a> (RML) and <a href="rifled%20breech%20loader">rifled breech loader</a> (RBL) types), mounted on fast-moving, manoueuvrable steam-powered ironclad warships such as the French "<a href="French%20ironclad%20Gloire">La Gloire</a>" and the British . Such vessels posed a serious threat to the important naval installations on the Thames, including the <a href="Victualler">victualling</a> yards at <a href="Deptford">Deptford</a>, the armaments works of <a href="Royal%20Arsenal">Woolwich Arsenal</a>, the shipbuilding yards at <a href="North%20Woolwich">North Woolwich</a>, and the magazines at <a href="Purfleet">Purfleet</a>. It was not possible for large warships to reach central London, as the river was not yet deep enough to take ships of more than 400 tons above Deptford. (Capital <a href="dredging">dredging</a> later enabled much larger ships to reach as far as the <a href="Pool%20of%20London">Pool of London</a>.) As the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> was soon to show, it was quite possible for the warships of the day to run past forts and attack up coastal rivers.

The new weapons meant that the existing coastal and riverine forts were rendered largely obsolete. The American Civil War was soon to demonstrate that traditional brick and masonry forts could be reduced to rubble by rifled guns. The government's response was to appoint a <a href="Royal%20Commission%20on%20the%20Defence%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom</a>, which published a far-reaching report in 1860. The Royal Commission recommended that a triangle of forts should be established on the lower Thames, east of <a href="Gravesend">Gravesend</a>. This would involve replacing the existing Coalhouse Fort on the Essex shore with a new fortification, similarly replacing the existing <a href="Shornemead%20Fort">Shornemead Fort</a> and building the wholly new <a href="Cliffe%20Fort">Cliffe Fort</a> opposite Coalhouse Point, which would replace the abandoned 18th-century battery at Lower Hope Point. The locations of the forts would enable interlocking arcs of fire from their guns. A <a href="Boom%20%28navigational%20barrier%29">boom defence</a> and a minefield would be installed off Coalhouse Point in wartime to further boost the strength of the defences.

The design of the new fort was similar to that of the other Royal Commission forts on the Thames, with an arc of granite-faced casemates, reinforced by iron shields. These, it was believed, would be virtually invulnerable to enemy fire. It was originally envisaged that the fort would have two tiers (in a design similar to that of <a href="Garrison%20Point%20Fort">Garrison Point Fort</a> at <a href="Sheerness">Sheerness</a>) mounting around 56 guns; 28 in casemates and the rest in <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s on the fort's roof. Construction began on this basis in July 1861 but as the work progressed the design was changed, leaving the fort with only a single tier of casemates. Like its predecessors, its construction was seriously affected by the poor ground conditions and was disrupted by shifting and cracking foundations. Colonel <a href="Charles%20George%20Gordon">Charles George Gordon</a>, who was later to die in the <a href="Siege%20of%20Khartoum">Siege of Khartoum</a>, supervised its final phases of construction. The fort cost a total of £130,000 to build.

It was originally intended that Coalhouse Fort would be armed with 68-pdr. smooth-bore guns, but these had become obsolete by the time it was completed in 1874. More powerful armour-piercing weapons were required, so the casemates were provided with four <a href="RML%2012.5%20inch%2038%20ton%20gun">12.5-inch</a> and thirteen <a href="RML%2011%20inch%2025%20ton%20gun">11-inch RMLs</a> with a range of about . A further three <a href="RML%209%20inch%2012%20ton%20gun">9-inch RMLs</a> were emplaced in the open battery. They were mounted on metal traversing platforms that could be elevated and traversed using hand-operated gearing devices. Operating the guns presented significant challenges; the 12.5-inch RMLs weighed up to apiece, used a charge weighing to fire a shell weighing to their maximum range, and broke windows half a mile away when they were fired. The detonations and clouds of choking black smoke generated when firing them presented a serious physical hazard to the gun crews.

The guns were controlled from a Battery Commander's Post on the roof, from where commands to the gun detachments could be relayed via <a href="Speaking%20tube">voice pipes</a>. Three <a href="depression%20range%20finder">depression range finder</a>s were installed on the roof by the late 1890s to aid the guns' targeting. A well-trained crew could fire each gun once every two minutes. Rather than firing all the guns at once, the guns were positioned so that they could be fired in sequence as an enemy ship passed by. When combined with the fire from Shornemead and Cliffe Forts on the Kent shore, this would ensure that constant fire could be maintained from three different sides.

The rapid development of artillery weapons in the late 19th century meant that the casemate style of fortification had become virtually obsolete within a decade of the fort's completion. Its original purpose of defending the river against large warships was taken over by a new <a href="East%20Tilbury%20Battery">East Tilbury Battery</a>, constructed in 1891 about to the north-west just outside East Tilbury village. This contained six much more powerful breech-loading (BL) guns on <a href="Disappearing%20gun">Moncrieff disappearing carriages</a> within concealed emplacements facing east up the river. A similar battery was built at <a href="Slough%20Fort">Slough Fort</a> on the Hoo Peninsula a few miles downriver.

At the same time, a new threat had emerged in the shape of the fast and highly manoeuvrable <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>. Large guns were virtually useless against such vessels, so the fort was supplemented with another new battery built in 1893 some to the south where 6-pdr. quick-firing guns were installed. Similar batteries were built on the opposite shore at Shornemead and Cliffe Forts.

By the start of the 20th century the fort's casemates had been put out of use as they were too vulnerable to modern artillery. Instead, part of the fort's front was covered with a sloping <a href="glacis">glacis</a> made of earth, blocking the casemates and filling the inner defensive ditch. At least one of the front caponiers was also demolished around this time. Most of the old RMLs were retired and replaced with four <a href="BL%206-inch%20Mk%20VII%20naval%20gun">Mk. VII six-inch BL guns</a> and four <a href="QF%2012-pounder%2012%20cwt%20naval%20gun">12-pdr quick-firing (QF) BL guns</a>, with ranges of and respectively, mounted on concrete emplacements on the fort's roof. The larger guns were intended to support those at East Tilbury Battery while the smaller ones provided a defence against fast-moving vessels such as destroyers and torpedo boats. Despite their obsolescence, two of the old 12.5-inch RMLs remained at the fort until as late as 1912. They were to be used as "giant blunderbusses" to spray torpedo boats with <a href="grapeshot">grapeshot</a> if they got past the other guns.

Coalhouse Fort was manned during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> by No. 2 Company, <a href="Royal%20Garrison%20Artillery">Royal Garrison Artillery</a>, which manned the guns; the 2nd Company <a href="London%20Electrical%20Engineers">London Electrical Engineers</a> operated the electric searchlights. A minefield was installed in the river between Shornemead and Coalhouse forts, with mechanically operated mines in the shallower parts of the river and remotely detonated mines in the navigable channel. Friendly ships could thus pass freely but the mines could be detonated by a shore-based observer if an enemy ship tried to use the main channel. Coalhouse Fort took on the role of an Examination Battery controlling the river traffic in conjunction with the River Examination Service. Incoming vessels were checked by tugs based alongside the old <a href="HMS%20Champion%20%281878%29">HMS "Champion"</a>, moored in midriver, and if any vessel was deemed suspect or refused to stop, the fort was authorised to fire across its bows.

The fort's armament was reduced during the war as other forts and batteries took over some of its duties. Two of the six-inch guns were shipped across the river to Cliffe Fort in 1914 and the QF guns on the roof were withdrawn. An anti-aircraft battery was established north-west of the fort for defence against <a href="Zeppelin">Zeppelin</a>s and enemy bombers.

Following the end of the war, it was proposed in 1924 that Coalhouse Fort should be re-equipped with 4-inch guns but post-war defence cuts meant that this plan was abandoned. Instead, the fort was reduced to care and maintenance status and East Tilbury Battery was decommissioned in 1930. The continuing development of artillery firepower meant that the forts and batteries further downriver took on an increased responsibility for the forward defences of the Thames. The forts on Gravesend Reach were relegated to a second line of defence.

Coalhouse Fort became an "emergency" battery during the <a href="British%20anti-invasion%20preparations%20of%20the%20Second%20World%20War">anti-invasion preparations of the early Second World War</a>. The existing 6-inch guns were replaced in July 1941 with two <a href="BL%205.5%20inch%20Mark%20I%20naval%20gun">5.5-inch guns</a> which had been removed from <a href="HMS%20Hood%20%2851%29">HMS "Hood"</a> during a refit in April 1940. These had a range of and were installed in two of the old 6-inch emplacements. A steel shelter was constructed on the fort's roof to protect the guns, which were also camouflaged with netting. A brick observation post on the roof provided range-finding, and two remotely controlled searchlights installed on the roof of the north caponier could illuminate the riverside below. The purpose of these installations was to protect against raids by <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s and torpedo boats and to counter any landings in the Thames.

The fort's defences were also enhanced with two light anti-aircraft guns, including a <a href="Bofors%2040%20mm%20gun">Bofors 40 mm gun</a> installed on the roof in August 1943, while the fort's perimeter was surrounded by barbed wire and trenches. Two <a href="Mortar%20%28weapon%29%23Spigot%20mortar">spigot mortars</a> were installed at the fort's rear; their bases can still be seen today. A detached concrete observation tower was built just north of the fort for use as an Extended Defence Officer's Post, to control the electrically detonated mines that had been laid in the river. A radar tower manned by naval personnel was also built south of the fort by 1941 to cover the approaches to the minefield, and an anti-aircraft battery was built to the north-west at Bowaters Farm in August 1939. It was frequently used in defence of the eastern approaches to London and was bombed on more than one occasion.

By 1944 the threat of invasion had abated and the fort was handed over to the <a href="Home%20Guard%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Home Guard</a>'s No. 356 Coast Battery detachment. Its complement at this time was a captain, two lieutenants and 103 other ranks. They were supplemented by a detachment of <a href="Women%27s%20Royal%20Naval%20Service">Wrens</a> who operated a <a href="degaussing">degaussing</a> range established at Coalhouse Fort in 1943 under the name of HMS "St Clement". Outbound ships passed over submerged sensors which detected whether the steel in their hulls had been demagnetised to a sufficient extent to make them undetectable by German <a href="magnetic%20mine">magnetic mine</a>s. If they were detected, they would be recalled for further degaussing. As one of the Wrens later recalled, they found themselves "surrounded by a wonderful array of young men, soldiers and marines of all ranks – and we were the only girls in sight."

HMS "St Clement" became a Combined Operations base and evolved into HMS "St Clement I", "II" and "III". As HMS "St Clement III", the fort's last military designation, it was used after 1946 by the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> for training <a href="Sea%20Cadet%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Sea Cadets</a> and nautical youth groups. It was decommissioned in 1949.

Coalhouse Fort is exceptionally well-preserved; it provides one of the finest surviving examples of a mid-Victorian armoured casemate fort. It has twelve casemates arranged in a semi-circle facing south and east towards the river, with an annexed open battery facing south-west. The casemates are faced with massive slabs of granite and have iron gun ports to protect the gunners from splinters dislodged by incoming fire.

Although the casemates have been altered over the years, many of their original features survive. None of the guns remain "in situ" but the metal rails on which they traversed are still in place. The casemates were divided into two sections. During periods of high alert the gun crews would live next to their weapons in the casemates' rear, an area known as the war accommodation. The front of the casemate was the gun emplacement proper, where the loading and firing took place. The iron shield protecting each casemate was fitted with iron bars from which two <a href="mantlet">mantlet</a>s made of thick lengths of rope were hung. These protected the gun crew from splinters and smoke. A loading bar above the gun-port enabled the crew to lift the heavy shells and cartridges up to the mouth of the gun. These were dispensed from the magazines below via lifts on either side of the emplacements.

The guns mounted in the open battery were lighter than those in the casemates and were not enclosed but traversed on rails in the open air. A covered section between each emplacement led to an ammunition lift shaft up which the shells and cartridges were raised using lifting gear that still survives.

Improvements to artillery technology necessitated significant changes to the fort's structure towards the end of the 19th century and the start of the 20th. Closely packed casemates of the type built at Coalhouse Fort were vulnerable to new and more powerful types of explosive shells. To alleviate this threat, massive concrete traverses were constructed in the 1880s to isolate each casemate, preventing a shell bursting inside one casemate from affecting its neighbours and causing a cumulative explosion. The construction of concrete gun emplacements on the fort's roof necessitated the installation of circular concrete pillars within the casemates to support the extra weight on the roof. The ammunition lifts were also extended to serve the new roof-mounted guns.

The magazines, situated deep under the casemates, consist of alternating pairs of shell and cartridge rooms accessed via an ammunition passage at the front and a lighting passage behind. Great care was taken to reduce the possibility of an accidental explosion. The magazine workers wore special clothes and shoes to eliminate the risk of striking sparks and the floors of the cartridge stores were covered by wooden <a href="batten">batten</a>s. The lighting was provided from oil lamps situated behind glass windows and accessed only from the lighting passage, which was physically separated from the rest of the magazine. Sets of lifting gear enabled the workers to winch the cartridges and ammunition up to the casemates, with which they could communicate via voice tubes.

A defensible barracks made of brick, faced in <a href="Kentish%20ragstone">Kentish ragstone</a> on the fort's exterior, closes off the gorge. Its line is indented to facilitate <a href="small%20arms">small arms</a> fire from loopholes and windows with armoured steel shutters. The first floor of the barracks had a veranda facing towards the fort's interior and supported on cast-iron pillars. The barracks provided accommodation for a wartime complement of six officers and 180 <a href="non-commissioned%20officers">NCOs</a> and men, though in peacetime only small maintenance detachments occupied the fort. It also accommodated storerooms and a hospital with room for fourteen patients. Although much of the barracks is now in poor condition, two of the kitchen ranges still survive and two rooms still contain service crests painted on their walls during the Second World War.

An irregularly shaped parade area occupies the middle of the fort, which is divided by a sloping ramp leading up to the casemates. A small brick building – originally used as a laboratory or shell-filling facility – stands to the right of the ramp. The fort is entered through a single gateway on its west side, protected against landward attackers by a <a href="caponier">caponier</a>. The front of the fort was surrounded by a dry ditch, in which there were originally four caponiers to provide musketry defence. A very wide outer wet ditch blocked access from the riverside.

The roof of the fort, accessed via steps up from the open battery, was altered substantially during the first half of the 20th century to accommodate new guns and other structures. These include emplacements for 5.5-inch and 6-inch guns as well as 12-pdrs, searchlight positions, shelters, an observation post, a fire control building, a machine-gun parapet on the north caponier and a Royal Navy monitoring station.

The fort was linked to a jetty, Coalhouse Wharf, on the riverside a short distance to the south. A <a href="standard%20gauge">standard gauge</a> railway track led from the fort's interior to the jetty and was used to bring guns and supplies from the wharf. The heaviest guns were transported to and from Coalhouse Fort (and other Thames forts) aboard two specialised gun barges called "Gog" and "Magog", built in 1886 and 1900 respectively and used until the 1960s. The remains of the jetty are still visible, as are sections of the track within the fort's entrance.
A two-storey concrete structure just north of the fort was used during the Second World War as an Extended Defence Officer's Post to control the minefield outside the fort. It could also serve as a <a href="pillbox%20%28military%29">pillbox</a>. A corresponding post stood on the Kent shore. A small concrete structure a further north-east of the fort may have been an electrical power house. The minefield was overlooked by a hexagonal radar tower about south of the fort, consisting of a concrete structure on a metal frame on which the radar array was mounted. This stands atop a brick building in which the power plant, electrical equipment radar screen and personnel accommodation were located. It was only used for a short time between 1941 and 1943 and is now considered structurally unsafe. Situated nearby is the detached battery built in 1893 to mount four 6-pdr. quick-firing guns. It is well-preserved and the emplacements, ready-use lockers and magazines are all still largely intact.

After being decommissioned, Coalhouse Fort was leased and used as a storage facility by <a href="Bata%20Shoes">Bata Shoes</a>, which operated the nearby <a href="Bata%20shoe%20factory%20%28East%20Tilbury%29">Bata shoe factory</a> in East Tilbury. It was also used for a while for emergency housing for demobilised servicemen and their families. In 1959, the parade ground was used as a coal store during a miners' strike. Thurrock Urban District Council (now Thurrock Council) purchased the fort in 1962 and still own it. The council turned the area around the fort into a riverside park but the building itself decayed badly through neglect and vandalism.

Coalhouse Fort and the adjacent artillery defences to the south of the fort were collectively designated as a <a href="scheduled%20monument">scheduled monument</a> in 1962, in recognition of their status as "a remarkable group of defensive sites". The fort has been leased to the Coalhouse Fort Project, a heritage charity operated by volunteers, since 1985. The project has been undertaking the gradual restoration of the fort ever since and hold regular open days. Various items of 20th century military equipment are on display in the interior of the fort, while the casemates house reconstructions and small military-related museums. The magazines and fort roof can be visited on volunteer-led guided tours.

The project has been highly commended in the British Archaeological Awards and the fort has featured both in the BBC series "<a href="Restoration%20%28TV%20series%29">Restoration</a>" and in the 2005 film "Batman Begins", in which it stood in for a <a href="Bhutan">Bhutan</a>ese prison in the first five minutes of the film. The British director <a href="Christopher%20Nolan">Christopher Nolan</a> had seen the TV series and decided that he wanted to set the film's opening scenes in the fort.

The poor condition of parts of the structure and its state of slow decay led to it be listed in 2008 on the <a href="Heritage%20at%20Risk">Heritage at Risk Register</a>. <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a> provided an emergency grant in 2009, supplemented by Thurrock Council and the filming fee from Warner Bros. for "Batman Begins", to help make £200,000 worth of repairs to the gatehouse. These were completed in 2011. Grants from <a href="Veolia%20Environnement">Veolia Thames</a> and Thurrock Council, via the Heritage Lottery Fund, have funded the construction of a new block outside the fort entrance to house a cafe, toilets and information centre. A four-mile (6.4 km) riverside walk known as the Two Forts Way links Coalhouse Fort with its older counterpart Tilbury Fort; it is described as "a challenging route suitable for able bodied walkers and experienced cyclists." Funded by the newly restructured <a href="Historic%20England">Historic England</a> (formerly English Heritage), a survey of the heritage site was completed in early 2017 and repairs to make the fort watertight were expected to begin in late 2017.

Russian battleship Potemkin

The Russian battleship "Potemkin" (, "Prince Potemkin of <a href="Taurida">Taurida</a>") was a <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a> built for the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Navy">Imperial Russian Navy</a>'s <a href="Black%20Sea%20Fleet">Black Sea Fleet</a>. She became famous when the crew rebelled against the officers in June 1905 (during <a href="1905%20Russian%20Revolution">that year's revolution</a>), which is now viewed as a first step towards the <a href="Russian%20Revolution">Russian Revolution</a> of 1917. The mutiny later formed the basis of <a href="Sergei%20Eisenstein">Sergei Eisenstein</a>'s 1925 silent film "<a href="The%20Battleship%20Potemkin">The Battleship Potemkin</a>".

After the mutineers sought asylum in <a href="Constan%C8%9Ba">Constanța</a>, Romania, and after the Russians recovered the ship, her name was changed to Panteleimon. She accidentally sank a Russian submarine in 1909 and was badly damaged when she <a href="Ship%20grounding">ran aground</a> in 1911. During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, "Panteleimon" participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20Sarych">Battle of Cape Sarych</a> in late 1914. She covered several bombardments of the <a href="Bosphorus">Bosphorus</a> fortifications in early 1915, including one where the ship was attacked by the Turkish <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a> <a href="SMS%20Goeben">"Yavuz Sultan Selim"</a> – "Panteleimon" and the other Russian pre-dreadnoughts present drove her off before she could inflict any serious damage. The ship was relegated to secondary roles after Russia's first <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a> entered service in late 1915. She was by then obsolete and was reduced to <a href="Reserve%20fleet">reserve</a> in 1918 in <a href="Sevastopol">Sevastopol</a>.

"Panteleimon" was captured when the Germans took Sevastopol in May 1918 and was handed over to the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allies</a> after the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany">Armistice</a> in November 1918. Her engines were destroyed by the British in 1919 when they withdrew from Sevastopol to prevent the advancing <a href="Bolsheviks">Bolsheviks</a> from using them against the <a href="White%20movement">White Russians</a>. She was abandoned when the Whites evacuated the <a href="Crimea">Crimea</a> in 1920 and was finally <a href="ship%20breaking">scrapped</a> by the Soviets in 1923.

Planning began in 1895 for a new battleship that would utilise a <a href="slipway">slipway</a> slated to become available at the <a href="Shipyard%20named%20after%2061%20Communards">Nikolayev Admiralty Shipyard</a> in 1896. The Naval Staff and the commander of the Black Sea Fleet, <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> K. P. Pilkin, agreed on a copy of the design, but they were overruled by <a href="General%20Admiral">General Admiral</a> <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Alexei%20Alexandrovich%20of%20Russia">Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich</a>. The General Admiral decided that the long range and less powerful guns of the "Peresvet" class were inappropriate for the narrow confines of the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>, and ordered the design of an improved version of the battleship instead. The improvements included a higher <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a> to improve the ship's <a href="seakeeping">seakeeping</a> qualities, <a href="Krupp%20cemented%20armour">Krupp cemented armour</a> and <a href="Belleville%20boilers">Belleville boilers</a>. The design process was complicated by numerous changes demanded by various departments of the Naval Technical Committee. The ship's design was finally approved on 12 June 1897, although design changes continued to be made that slowed the ship's construction.

Construction of "Potemkin" began on 27 December 1897 and she was <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> at the Nikolayev Admiralty Shipyard on 10 October 1898. She was named in honour of Prince <a href="Grigory%20Potemkin">Grigory Potemkin</a>, a Russian soldier and statesman. The ship was launched on 9 October 1900 and transferred to Sevastopol for <a href="fitting%20out">fitting out</a> on 4 July 1902. She began <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s in September 1903 and these continued, off and on, until early 1905 when her gun turrets were completed.

"Potemkin" was <a href="length%20at%20the%20waterline">long at the waterline</a> and long <a href="length%20overall">overall</a>. She had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a maximum <a href="draft%20%28hull%29">draught</a> of . She displaced , more than its designed displacement of . "Potemkin"s crew consisted of 26 officers and 705 enlisted men.

The ship had a pair of three-cylinder <a href="Marine%20steam%20engine%23Triple%20or%20multiple%20expansion">vertical triple-expansion steam engines</a>, each of which drove one <a href="propeller">propeller</a>, that had a total designed output of . Twenty-two <a href="Belleville%20boiler">Belleville boiler</a>s provided steam to the engines at a pressure of . The 8 boilers in the forward boiler room were oil-fired and the remaining 14 were coal-fired. During her sea trials on 31 October 1903, she reached a top speed of . Leaking oil caused a serious fire on 2 January 1904 that caused the navy to convert her boilers to coal firing at a cost of 20,000 <a href="ruble">ruble</a>s. The ship carried a maximum of of coal at full load that provided a range of at a speed of .

The main armament consisted of four 40-<a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">calibre</a> guns mounted in twin <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s fore and aft of the <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>. The electrically operated turrets were derived from the design of those used by the s. These guns had a maximum elevation of +15° and their rate of fire was very slow, only one round every four minutes during gunnery trials. They fired a shell at a <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of . At an elevation of +10° the guns had a range of . "Potemkin" carried 60 rounds for each gun.

The sixteen 45-calibre, <a href="152%20mm%2045%20caliber%20Pattern%201892"></a> <a href="Canet%20guns">Canet</a> Pattern 1891 <a href="quick-firing%20gun">quick-firing (QF) guns</a> were mounted in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s. Twelve of these were placed on the sides of the hull and the other four were positioned at the corners of the superstructure. They fired shells that weighed with a muzzle velocity of . They had a maximum range of when fired at an elevation of +20°. The ship stowed 160 rounds per gun.

Smaller guns were carried for close-range defence against <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s. These included fourteen 50-calibre Canet QF <a href="75mm%2050%20caliber%20Pattern%201892"></a> guns: four in hull <a href="embrasure">embrasure</a>s and the remaining 10 mounted on the superstructure. The ship carried 300 shells for each gun. They fired an shell at a muzzle velocity of to a maximum range of . She also mounted six <a href="Hotchkiss%20gun">Hotchkiss gun</a>s. Four of these were mounted in the <a href="Top%20%28sailing%20ship%29">fighting top</a> and two on the superstructure. They fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of .

"Potemkin" had five underwater <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s: one in the bow and two on each <a href="broadside">broadside</a>. She carried three torpedoes for each tube. The model of torpedo in use changed over time; the first torpedo that the ship would have been equipped with was the M1904. It had a <a href="warhead">warhead</a> weight of and a speed of with a maximum range of .

In 1907 <a href="telescopic%20sight">telescopic sight</a>s were fitted for the 12-inch and 6-inch guns. In that or the following year <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a>s were installed. The bow torpedo tube was removed in 1910–11, as was the fighting top. The following year the main-gun turret machinery was upgraded and the guns were modified to improve their rate of fire to one round every 40 seconds.

Two <a href="Anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft (AA) guns</a> were mounted on the ship's superstructure on 3–6 June 1915; they were supplemented by two 75 mm AA guns, one on top of each turret, probably during 1916. In February 1916 the ship's four remaining torpedo tubes were removed. At some point during World War I, her 75 mm guns were also removed.

The maximum thickness of the Krupp cemented armour <a href="Belt%20armor">waterline belt</a> was which reduced to abreast the <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a>s. It covered of the ship's length and plates protected the waterline to the ends of the ship. The belt was high, of which was below the <a href="waterline">waterline</a>, and tapered down to a thickness of at its bottom edge. The main part of the belt terminated in transverse <a href="bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkhead</a>s.

Above the belt was the upper <a href="strake">strake</a> of six-inch armour that was long and closed off by six-inch transverse bulkheads fore and aft. The upper casemate protected the six-inch guns and was five inches thick on all sides. The sides of the turrets were thick and they had a two-inch roof. The <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a>'s sides were nine inches thick. The nickel-steel armour deck was two inches thick on the flat amidships, but thick on the slope connecting it to the armour belt. Fore and aft of the armoured <a href="Citadel%23Naval%20term">citadel</a>, the deck was to the bow and stern. In 1910–11, additional armour plates were added fore and aft; their exact location is unknown, but they were probably used to extend the height of the two-inch armour strake at the ends of the ship.

During the <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">Russo-Japanese War</a> of 1904–05, many of the Black Sea Fleet's most experienced officers and enlisted men were transferred to the ships in the Pacific to replace losses. This left the fleet with primarily raw recruits and less capable officers. With the news of the disastrous <a href="Battle%20of%20Tsushima">Battle of Tsushima</a> in May 1905 morale dropped to an all-time low, and any minor incident could be enough to spark a major catastrophe. Taking advantage of the situation, plus the disruption caused by the <a href="Revolution%20of%201905">ongoing riots and uprisings</a>, the Central Committee of the Social Democratic Organisation of the Black Sea Fleet, called "Tsentralka", had started preparations for a simultaneous mutiny on all of the ships of the fleet, although the timing had not been decided.

On 27 June 1905, "Potemkin" was at gunnery practice near Tendra Island off the Ukrainian coast when many enlisted men refused to eat the <a href="borscht">borscht</a> made from rotten meat partially infested with <a href="Maggot">maggots</a>. The uprising was triggered when <a href="Ippolit%20Giliarovsky">Ippolit Giliarovsky</a>, the ship's second in command, allegedly threatened to shoot crew members for their refusal. He summoned the ship's marine guards as well as a <a href="tarpaulin">tarpaulin</a> to protect the ship's deck from any blood in an attempt to intimidate the crew. Giliarovsky was killed after he mortally wounded <a href="Grigory%20Vakulinchuk">Grigory Vakulinchuk</a>, one of the mutiny's leaders. The mutineers killed seven of the "Potemkin"s eighteen officers, including Captain <a href="Evgeny%20Golikov">Evgeny Golikov</a> (), and captured the <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a> (No. 627). They organized a ship's committee of 25 sailors, led by <a href="Afanasi%20Matushenko">Afanasi Matushenko</a>, to run the battleship.

The committee decided to head for <a href="Odessa">Odessa</a> flying a <a href="red%20flag%20%28politics%29">red flag</a> and arrived there later that day at 22:00. A <a href="general%20strike">general strike</a> had been called in the city and there was some rioting as the police tried to quell the strikers. The following day the mutineers refused to land armed sailors to help the striking revolutionaries take over the city, preferring instead to await the arrival of the other battleships of the Black Sea Fleet. Later that day the mutineers aboard the Potemkin captured a military transport, "<a href="Vekha">Vekha</a>", that had arrived in the city. The riots continued as much of the port area was destroyed by fire. On the afternoon of 29 June, Vakulinchuk's funeral turned into a political demonstration and the army attempted to ambush the sailors who participated in the funeral. In retaliation, the ship fired two six-inch shells at the theatre where a high-level military meeting was scheduled to take place, but missed.

The government issued an order to send two <a href="squadron%20%28naval%29">squadron</a>s to Odessa either to force the "Potemkin"s crew to give up or sink the battleship. "Potemkin" sortied on the morning of 30 June to meet the three battleships "Tri Sviatitelia", , and of the first squadron, but the loyal ships turned away. The second squadron arrived with the battleships and later that morning, and Vice Admiral <a href="Aleksander%20Krieger">Aleksander Krieger</a>, acting commander of the Black Sea Fleet, ordered the ships to proceed to Odessa. "Potemkin" sortied again and sailed through the combined squadrons as Krieger failed to order his ships to fire. Captain Kolands of "Dvenadsat Apostolov" attempted to <a href="Naval%20ram">ram</a> "Potemkin" and then detonate his ship's magazines, but he was thwarted by members of his crew. Krieger ordered his ships to fall back, but the crew of "Georgii Pobedonosets" mutinied and joined "Potemkin".

The following morning, loyalist members of "Georgii Pobedonosets" retook control of the ship and ran her aground in Odessa harbor. The crew of "Potemkin", together with "Ismail", decided to sail for Constanța later that day where they could restock food, water and coal. The Romanians refused to provide the supplies, backed by the presence of their small <a href="protected%20cruiser">protected cruiser</a> <a href="NMS%20Elisabeta">"Elisabeta"</a>, so the ship's committee decided to sail for the small, barely defended port of <a href="Feodosiya">Theodosia</a> in the <a href="Crimea">Crimea</a> where they hoped to resupply. The ship arrived on the morning of 5 July, but the city's governor refused to give them anything other than food. The mutineers attempted to seize several barges of coal the following morning, but the port's garrison ambushed them and killed or captured 22 of the 30 sailors involved. They decided to return to Constanța that afternoon.
"Potemkin" reached its destination at 23:00 on 7 July and the Romanians agreed to give asylum to the crew if they would disarm themselves and surrender the battleship. "Ismail"s crew decided the following morning to return to Sevastopol and turn themselves in, but "Potemkin"s crew voted to accept the terms. Captain Negru, commander of the port, came aboard at noon and hoisted the Romanian flag and then allowed the ship to enter the inner harbor. Before the crew disembarked, Matushenko ordered that the "Potemkin"s <a href="Kingston%20valve">Kingston valve</a>s be opened so she would sink to the bottom.

When Rear Admiral Pisarevsky reached Constanța on the morning of 9 July, he found the "Potemkin" half sunk in the harbor and flying the Romanian flag. After several hours of negotiations with the Romanian Government, the battleship was handed over to the Russians. Later that day the <a href="Russian%20Navy%20Ensign">Russian Navy Ensign</a> was raised over the battleship. She was then easily refloated by the navy, but the salt water had damaged its engines and boilers. The ship left Constanța on 10 July, having to be towed back to Sevastopol, where she arrived on 14 July. The ship was renamed "Panteleimon" (), after <a href="Saint%20Pantaleon">Saint Pantaleon</a>, on 12 October 1905. Some members of "Panteleimon"s crew joined a mutiny that began aboard the protected cruiser "Ochakov" () in November, but it was easily suppressed as both ships had been earlier disarmed.

"Panteleimon" received an experimental underwater communications set in February 1909. Later that year, she accidentally rammed and sank the submarine "Kambala" () at night on 11 June [according to Russian sources, "Kambala" sank in a collision with the battleship <a href="Russian%20battleship%20Rostislav">"Rostislav"</a>, not with "Panteleimon"], killing the 16 crewmen aboard the submarine.

While returning from a port visit to Constanța in 1911, "Panteleimon" ran aground on 2 October. It took several days to refloat her and make temporary repairs, and the full extent of the damage to its bottom was not fully realized for several more months. The ship participated in training and gunnery exercises for the rest of the year; a special watch was kept to ensure that no damaged seams were opened while firing. Permanent repairs, which involved replacing its boiler foundations, plating, and a large number of its hull frames, lasted from 10 January to 25 April 1912. The navy took advantage of these repairs to <a href="wikt%3Aoverhaul">overhaul</a> its engines and boilers.

"Panteleimon", flagship of the 1st Battleship Brigade, accompanied by the pre-dreadnoughts , , and "Tri Sviatitelia", covered the pre-dreadnought "Rostislav" while it bombarded <a href="Trabzon">Trebizond</a> on the morning of 17 November 1914. They were intercepted the following day by the Ottoman battlecruiser "Yavuz Sultan Selim" (the ex-German <a href="SMS%20Goeben">SMS "Goeben"</a>) and the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> "Midilli" (the ex-German <a href="SMS%20Breslau">SMS "Breslau"</a>) on their return voyage to Sevastopol in what came to be known as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20Sarych">Battle of Cape Sarych</a>. Despite the noon hour the conditions were foggy; the <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>s initially did not spot each other. Although several other ships opened fire, hitting the "Goeben" once, "Panteleimon" held fire because its turrets could not see the German ships before they disengaged.

"Tri Sviatitelia" and "Rostislav" bombarded Ottoman fortifications at the mouth of the <a href="Bosphorus">Bosphorus</a> on 18 March 1915, the first of several attacks intended to divert troops and attention from the ongoing <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli Campaign</a>, but fired only 105 rounds before sailing north to rejoin "Panteleimon", "Ioann Zlatoust" and "Evstafi". "Tri Sviatitelia" and "Rostislav" were intended to repeat the bombardment the following day, but were hindered by heavy fog. On 3 April, "Yavuz Sultan Selim" and several ships of the Turkish navy raided the Russian port at Odessa; the Russian battleship squadron sortied to intercept them. The battleships chased "Yavuz Sultan Selim" the entire day, but were unable to reach effective gunnery range and were forced to break off the chase. On 25 April "Tri Sviatitelia" and "Rostislav" repeated their bombardment of the Bosphorus forts. "Tri Sviatitelia", "Rostislav" and "Panteleimon" bombarded the forts again on 2 and 3 May. This time a total of 337 main-gun rounds were fired in addition to 528 six-inch shells between the three battleships.

On 9 May 1915, "Tri Sviatitelia" and "Panteleimon" returned to bombard the Bosphorus forts, covered by the remaining pre-dreadnoughts. "Yavuz Sultan Selim" intercepted the three ships of the covering force, although no damage was inflicted by either side. "Tri Sviatitelia" and "Pantelimon" rejoined their consorts and the latter scored two hits on "Yavuz Sultan Selim" before it broke off the action. The Russian ships pursued it for six hours before giving up the chase. On 1 August, all of the Black Sea pre-dreadnoughts were transferred to the 2nd Battleship Brigade, after the more powerful dreadnought entered service. On 1 October the new dreadnought provided cover while "Ioann Zlatoust" and "Pantelimon" bombarded <a href="Zonguldak">Zonguldak</a> and "Evstafi" shelled the nearby town of Kozlu. The ship bombarded <a href="Varna">Varna</a> twice in October 1915; during the second bombardment on 27 October, it entered Varna Bay and was unsuccessfully attacked by two German submarines stationed there.

"Panteleimon" supported Russian troops in early 1916 as they captured Trebizond and participated in an anti-shipping sweep off the northwestern <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>n coast in January 1917 that destroyed 39 Ottoman sailing ships. On 13 April 1917, after the <a href="February%20Revolution">February Revolution</a>, the ship was renamed "Potemkin-Tavricheskiy" (), and then on 11 May renamed "Borets za svobodu" ( – "Freedom Fighter").

She was placed in reserve in March 1918 and was captured by the Germans at Sevastopol in May. They handed the ship over to the Allies in December 1918 after the Armistice. The British wrecked her engines on 19 April 1919 when they left the Crimea to prevent the advancing Bolsheviks from using it against the White Russians. Thoroughly obsolete by this time, the ship was captured by both sides during the <a href="Russian%20Civil%20War">Russian Civil War</a>, but was abandoned by the White Russians when they evacuated the Crimea in November 1920. "Borets za svobodu" was scrapped beginning in 1923, although she was not stricken from the <a href="Navy%20List">Navy List</a> until 21 November 1925.

The immediate effects of the mutiny are difficult to assess. It may have influenced <a href="Tsar">Tsar</a> <a href="Nicholas%20II%20of%20Russia">Nicholas II</a>'s decisions to end the Russo-Japanese War and accept the <a href="October%20Manifesto">October Manifesto</a>, as the mutiny demonstrated that his régime no longer had the unquestioning loyalty of the military. The mutiny's failure did not stop other revolutionaries from inciting insurrections later that year, including the <a href="Sevastopol%20Uprising">Sevastopol Uprising</a>. <a href="Vladimir%20Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a>, leader of the <a href="Bolshevik%20Party">Bolshevik Party</a>, called the 1905 Revolution, including the "Potemkin" mutiny, a "dress rehearsal" for his successful <a href="Russian%20Revolution">revolution</a> in 1917. The Communists seized upon it as a <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a> symbol for their party and unduly emphasized their role in the mutiny. In fact, Matushenko explicitly rejected the Bolsheviks because he and the other leaders of the mutiny were <a href="Socialism">Socialists</a> of one type or another and cared nothing for <a href="Communism">Communism</a>.

The mutiny was memorialized most famously by <a href="Sergei%20Eisenstein">Sergei Eisenstein</a> in his 1925 silent film "<a href="Battleship%20Potemkin">Battleship Potemkin</a>", although the French silent film "La Révolution en Russe" ("Mutiny on a Man-of-War in Odessa" or "Revolution in Odessa", 1905), directed by <a href="Ferdinand%20Zecca">Ferdinand Zecca</a> or <a href="Lucien%20Nonguet">Lucien Nonguet</a> (or both), was the first film to depict the mutiny, preceding Eisenstein's far more famous film by 20 years. Filmed shortly after the Bolshevik victory in the Russian Civil War of 1917–22, with the derelict battleship "<a href="Russian%20battleship%20Dvenadsat%20Apostolov">Dvenadsat Apostolov</a>" standing in for the broken-up "Potemkin", Eisenstein recast the mutiny into a predecessor of the <a href="October%20Revolution">October Revolution</a> of 1917 that swept the Bolsheviks to power. He emphasized their role, and implied that the mutiny failed because Matushenko and the other leaders were not better Bolsheviks. Eisenstein made other changes to dramatize the story, ignoring the major fire that swept through Odessa's dock area while "Potemkin" was anchored there, combining the many different incidents of rioters and soldiers fighting into a famous sequence on the steps (today known as <a href="Potemkin%20Stairs">Potemkin Stairs</a>), and showing a tarpaulin thrown over the sailors to be executed.

In accordance with the Marxist doctrine that history is made by collective action, not individuals, Eisenstein forbore to single out any person in his film, but rather focused on the "mass protagonist". Soviet film critics hailed this approach, including the <a href="dramaturge">dramaturge</a> and critic, <a href="Adrian%20Piotrovsky">Adrian Piotrovsky</a>, writing for the <a href="Leningrad">Leningrad</a> newspaper "Krasnaia gazeta": The hero is the sailors' battleship, the Odessa crowd, but characteristic figures are snatched here and there from the crowd. For a moment, like a conjuring trick, they attract all the sympathies of the audience: like the sailor Vakulinchuk, like the young woman and child on the Odessa Steps, but they emerge only to dissolve once more into the mass. This signifies: no film stars but a film of real-life types.

Similarly, theatre critic Alexei Gvozdev wrote in the journal "Artistic Life" ("Zhizn ikusstva"): "In "Potemkin" there is no individual hero as there was in the old theatre. It is the mass that acts: the battleship and its sailors and the city and its population in revolutionary mood."

The last survivor of the mutiny was Ivan Beshoff, who died on 24 October 1987 at the age of 102 in Dublin.
