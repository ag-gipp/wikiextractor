Scottish Parliament

The Scottish Parliament (; <a href="Scots%20language">Scots</a>: "The Scots Pairlament") is the <a href="Devolution">devolved</a> <a href="Unicameralism">unicameral</a> legislature of <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>. Located in the <a href="Holyrood%2C%20Edinburgh">Holyrood</a> area of the capital city, <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, it is frequently referred to by the <a href="metonymy">metonym</a> Holyrood.

The Parliament is a democratically elected body comprising 129 members known as <a href="Member%20of%20the%20Scottish%20Parliament">Members of the Scottish Parliament</a> (MSPs), elected for four-year terms under the <a href="additional%20member%20system">additional member system</a>: 73 MSPs represent individual geographical <a href="Scottish%20Parliament%20constituencies%20and%20regions">constituencies</a> elected by the <a href="Plurality%20voting%20system">plurality</a> (‘first past the post’) system, while a further 56 are returned from eight <a href="Additional%20Member%20System">additional member</a> regions, each electing seven MSPs. The most recent <a href="Scottish%20Parliament%20election%2C%202016">general election</a> to the Parliament was held on 5 May 2016, with the <a href="Scottish%20National%20Party">Scottish National Party</a> winning a plurality.

The original <a href="Parliament%20of%20Scotland">Parliament of Scotland</a> was the national legislature of the independent <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Kingdom of Scotland</a>, and existed from the early 13th century until the Kingdom of Scotland merged with the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">Kingdom of England</a> under the <a href="Acts%20of%20Union%201707">Acts of Union 1707</a> to form the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Kingdom of Great Britain</a>. As a consequence, both the Parliament of Scotland and the <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">Parliament of England</a> ceased to exist, and the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Great%20Britain">Parliament of Great Britain</a>, which sat at <a href="Westminster">Westminster</a> in London was formed.

Following a <a href="Scottish%20devolution%20referendum%2C%201997">referendum in 1997</a>, in which the Scottish electorate voted for devolution, the powers of the <a href="devolution">devolved</a> legislature were specified by the <a href="Scotland%20Act%201998">Scotland Act 1998</a>. The Act delineates the legislative competence of the Parliament – the areas in which it can make <a href="Scots%20law">laws</a> – by explicitly specifying powers that are "<a href="reserved%20and%20excepted%20matters">reserved</a>" to the <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament of the United Kingdom</a>. The Scottish Parliament has the power to legislate in all areas that are not explicitly reserved to Westminster. The British Parliament retains the ability to amend the terms of reference of the Scottish Parliament, and can extend or reduce the areas in which it can make laws. The first meeting of the new Parliament took place on 12 May 1999. The competence of the Scottish Parliament has been amended numerous times since then, most notably by the <a href="Scotland%20Act%202012">Scotland Act 2012</a> and <a href="Scotland%20Act%202016">Scotland Act 2016</a>, with some of the most significant changes being the expansion of the Parliament's powers, especially over taxation and welfare.

Before the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Union%201707">Treaty of Union 1707</a> united the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Kingdom of Scotland</a> and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">Kingdom of England</a> into a new state called "<a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a>", Scotland had an <a href="independence">independent</a> parliament known as the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Scotland">Parliament of Scotland</a>. Initial Scottish proposals in the negotiation over the Union suggested a devolved Parliament be retained in Scotland, but this was not accepted by the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">English</a> negotiators.

For the next three hundred years, Scotland was directly governed by the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Great%20Britain">Parliament of Great Britain</a> and the subsequent <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament of the United Kingdom</a>, both seated at Westminster, and the lack of a Parliament of Scotland remained an important element in <a href="Scottish%20national%20identity">Scottish national identity</a>. Suggestions for a 'devolved' Parliament were made before 1914, but were shelved due to the outbreak of the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>. A sharp rise in nationalism in Scotland during the late 1960s fuelled demands for some form of <a href="devolution">home rule</a> or complete <a href="Scottish%20independence">independence</a>, and in 1969 prompted the incumbent <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour</a> government of <a href="Harold%20Wilson">Harold Wilson</a> to set up the <a href="Royal%20Commission%20on%20the%20Constitution%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Kilbrandon Commission</a> to consider the <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British constitution</a>. One of the principal objectives of the commission was to examine ways of enabling more self-government for Scotland, within the unitary state of the United Kingdom. Kilbrandon published his report in 1973 recommending the establishment of a directly elected <a href="Scottish%20Assembly">Scottish Assembly</a> to legislate for the majority of domestic Scottish affairs.

During this time, the discovery of <a href="North%20Sea%20oil">oil</a> in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> and the following "<a href="It%27s%20Scotland%27s%20oil">It's Scotland's oil</a>" campaign of the <a href="Scottish%20National%20Party">Scottish National Party</a> (SNP) resulted in rising support for Scottish independence, as well as the SNP. The party argued that the revenues from the oil were not benefitting Scotland as much as they should. The combined effect of these events led to <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> Wilson committing his government to some form of devolved legislature in 1974. However, it was not until 1978 that final legislative proposals for a Scottish Assembly were passed by the United Kingdom Parliament.

Under the terms of the <a href="Scotland%20Act%201978">Scotland Act 1978</a>, an elected assembly would be set up in Edinburgh provided that a referendum be held on 1 March 1979, with at least 40% of the total electorate voting in favour of the proposal. The <a href="Scottish%20devolution%20referendum%2C%201979">1979 Scottish devolution referendum</a> failed: although the vote was 51.6% in favour of a Scottish Assembly, with a turnout of 63.6%, the majority represented only 32.9% of the eligible voting population.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, demand for a Scottish Parliament grew, in part because the government of the United Kingdom was controlled by the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a>, while Scotland itself elected relatively few Conservative MPs. In the aftermath of the 1979 referendum defeat, the <a href="Campaign%20for%20a%20Scottish%20Assembly">Campaign for a Scottish Assembly</a> was initiated as a <a href="pressure%20group">pressure group</a>, leading to the 1989 <a href="Scottish%20Constitutional%20Convention">Scottish Constitutional Convention</a> with various organisations such as <a href="Religion%20in%20Scotland">Scottish churches</a>, <a href="List%20of%20political%20parties%20in%20Scotland">political parties</a> and representatives of industry taking part. Publishing its blueprint for devolution in 1995, the Convention provided much of the basis for the structure of the Parliament.
Devolution continued to be part of the platform of the Labour Party which, in May 1997, took power under <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a>. In September 1997, the <a href="1997%20Scottish%20devolution%20referendum">Scottish devolution referendum</a> was put to the Scottish electorate and secured a majority in favour of the establishment of a new devolved Scottish Parliament, with tax-varying powers, in Edinburgh. An election was held on 6 May 1999, and on 1 July of that year power was transferred from Westminster to the new Parliament.

Since September 2004, the official home of the Scottish Parliament has been a new <a href="Scottish%20Parliament%20Building">Scottish Parliament Building</a>, in the Holyrood area of Edinburgh. The Scottish Parliament building was designed by Spanish architect <a href="Enric%20Miralles">Enric Miralles</a> in partnership with local Edinburgh Architecture firm <a href="RMJM">RMJM</a> which was led by Design Principal <a href="Tony%20Kettle">Tony Kettle</a>. Some of the principal features of the complex include leaf-shaped buildings, a grass-roofed branch merging into adjacent parkland and <a href="gabion">gabion</a> walls formed from the stones of previous buildings. Throughout the building there are many repeated motifs, such as shapes based on <a href="Henry%20Raeburn">Raeburn's</a> <a href="The%20Skating%20Minister">Skating Minister</a>. <a href="Crow-stepped%20gable">Crow-stepped gable</a>s and the upturned boat skylights of the Garden Lobby, complete the unique architecture. <a href="Elizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth II</a> opened the new building on 9 October 2004.

In March 2006, one of the Holyrood building's roof beams slipped out of its support and was left dangling above the back benches during a debate. The debating chamber was subsequently closed, and MSPs moved to <a href="The%20Hub%20%28Edinburgh%29">The Hub</a> for one week, whilst inspections were carried out. During repairs, all chamber business was conducted in the Parliament's committee room two.

While the permanent building at Holyrood was being constructed, a temporary home for the Parliament was found in Edinburgh. The <a href="General%20Assembly%20Hall%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20Scotland">General Assembly Hall</a> of the <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">Church of Scotland</a> on the <a href="Royal%20Mile">Royal Mile</a> was chosen to host the Parliament. Official photographs and television interviews were held in the courtyard adjoining the Assembly Hall, which is part of the <a href="New%20College%2C%20Edinburgh">School of Divinity</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Edinburgh">University of Edinburgh</a>. This building was vacated twice to allow for the meeting of the <a href="General%20Assembly%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20Scotland">Church's General Assembly</a>. In May 2000, the Parliament was temporarily relocated to the former <a href="Strathclyde%20Regional%20Council">Strathclyde Regional Council</a> debating chamber in Glasgow, and to the <a href="University%20of%20Aberdeen">University of Aberdeen</a> in May 2002.

After each election to the Scottish Parliament, at the beginning of each parliamentary session, Parliament elects one MSP to serve as <a href="Presiding%20Officer%20of%20the%20Scottish%20Parliament">Presiding Officer</a>, the equivalent of the speaker in other legislatures, and two MSPs to serve as deputies. The Presiding Officer (currently <a href="Ken%20Macintosh">Ken Macintosh</a>) and deputies (currently <a href="Linda%20Fabiani">Linda Fabiani</a> and <a href="Christine%20Grahame">Christine Grahame</a>) are elected by a <a href="secret%20ballot">secret ballot</a> of the 129 MSPs, which is the only secret ballot conducted in the Scottish Parliament. Principally, the role of the Presiding Officer is to chair chamber proceedings and the <a href="Scottish%20Parliamentary%20Corporate%20Body">Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body</a>. When chairing meetings of the Parliament, the Presiding Officer and his/her deputies must be politically impartial. During debates, the Presiding Officer (or the deputy) is assisted by the parliamentary clerks, who give advice on how to interpret the <a href="Rules%20of%20order">standing orders</a> that govern the proceedings of meetings. A vote clerk sits in front of the Presiding Officer and operates the electronic voting equipment and chamber clocks.

As a member of the <a href="Scottish%20Parliamentary%20Corporate%20Body">Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body</a>, the Presiding Officer is responsible for ensuring that the Parliament functions effectively and has the staff, property and resources it requires to operate. Convening the Parliamentary Bureau, which allocates time and sets the work agenda in the chamber, is another of the roles of the Presiding Officer. Under the Standing Orders of the Parliament the Bureau consists of the Presiding Officer and one representative from each political party with five or more seats in the Parliament. Amongst the duties of the Bureau are to agree the timetable of business in the chamber, establish the number, remit and membership of parliamentary committees and regulate the passage of legislation (bills) through the Parliament. The Presiding Officer also represents the Scottish Parliament at home and abroad in an official capacity.

The Presiding Officer controls debates by calling on members to speak. If a member believes that a rule (or standing order) has been breached, he or she may raise a "<a href="point%20of%20order">point of order</a>", on which the Presiding Officer makes a ruling that is not subject to any debate or appeal. The Presiding Officer may also discipline members who fail to observe the rules of the Parliament.

The <a href="Cabinet%20Secretary%20for%20Government%20Business%20and%20Constitutional%20Relations">Cabinet Secretary for Government Business and Constitutional Relations</a>, supported by the <a href="Minister%20for%20Parliamentary%20Business">Minister for Parliamentary Business</a>, is responsible for steering the Scottish Government's executive business through Parliament.

The <a href="debating%20chamber">debating chamber</a> of the Scottish Parliament has seating arranged in a <a href="Hemicycle%20%28chamber%29">hemicycle</a>, a design which is common across European legislatures, intended to encourage consensus and compromise. There are 131 seats in the debating chamber. Of the total 131 seats, 129 are occupied by the Parliament's elected MSPs and two are seats for the Scottish Law Officers—the <a href="Lord%20Advocate">Lord Advocate</a> and the <a href="Solicitor%20General%20for%20Scotland">Solicitor General for Scotland</a>, who are not elected members of the Parliament but are members of the Scottish Government. As such, the Law Officers may attend and speak in the plenary meetings of the Parliament but, as they are not elected MSPs, cannot vote.

Members are able to sit anywhere in the debating chamber, but typically sit in their party groupings. The First Minister, Scottish <a href="List%20of%20Scottish%20Governments">cabinet ministers</a> and Law officers sit in the front row, in the middle section of the chamber. The largest party in the Parliament sits in the middle of the semicircle, with opposing parties on either side. The Presiding Officer, parliamentary clerks and officials sit opposite members at the front of the debating chamber.

In front of the Presiding Officers' desk is the parliamentary <a href="ceremonial%20mace">mace</a>, which is made from silver and <a href="inlay">inlaid</a> with gold panned from Scottish rivers and inscribed with the words: "Wisdom", "Compassion", "Justice" and "Integrity". The words "There shall be a Scottish Parliament", which are the first words of the Scotland Act, are inscribed around the head of the mace, which has a ceremonial role in the meetings of Parliament, representing the authority of the Parliament to make laws. Presented to the Scottish Parliament by the Queen upon Parliament's official opening in July 1999, the mace is displayed in a glass case, suspended from the lid. At the beginning of each sitting in the chamber, the lid of the case is rotated so that the mace is above the glass, to symbolise that a full meeting of the Parliament is taking place.

Parliament typically sits Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays from early January to late June and from early September to mid December, with two-week recesses in April and October. Plenary meetings in the debating chamber usually take place on Wednesday afternoons from 2 pm to 6 pm and on Thursdays from 9:15 am to 6 pm. Chamber debates and committee meetings are open to the public. Entry is free, but booking in advance is recommended due to limited space. Parliament TV is a webcast and archive of Parliamentary business back to 2012. and on the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s parliamentary channel <a href="BBC%20Parliament">BBC Parliament</a>. Proceedings are also recorded in text form, in print and online, in the "Official Report", which is the substantially verbatim transcript of parliamentary debates.

Since September 2012, the first item of business on Tuesday afternoons is usually Time for Reflection at which a speaker addresses members for up to four minutes, sharing a perspective on issues of <a href="faith">faith</a>. This contrasts with the formal style of "Prayers", which is the first item of business in meetings of the <a href="British%20House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a>. Speakers are drawn from across Scotland and are chosen to represent the balance of religious beliefs according to the <a href="Census%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Scottish census</a>. Invitations to address Parliament in this manner are determined by the Presiding Officer on the advice of the parliamentary bureau. Faith groups can make direct representations to the Presiding Officer to nominate speakers. Before September 2012, Time for reflection was held on Wednesday afternoons.

The Presiding Officer (or Deputy Presiding Officer) decides who speaks in chamber debates and the amount of time for which they are allowed to speak. Normally, the Presiding Officer tries to achieve a balance between different viewpoints and political parties when selecting members to speak. Typically, ministers or party leaders open debates, with opening speakers given between 5 and 20 minutes, and succeeding speakers allocated less time. The Presiding Officer can reduce speaking time if a large number of members wish to participate in the debate. Debate is more informal than in some parliamentary systems. Members may call each other directly by name, rather than by constituency or cabinet position, and hand clapping is allowed. Speeches to the chamber are normally delivered in English, but members may use <a href="Scots%20language">Scots</a>, <a href="Scottish%20Gaelic">Gaelic</a>, or any other language with the agreement of the Presiding Officer. The Scottish Parliament has conducted debates in the Gaelic language.

Each sitting day, normally at 5 pm, MSPs decide on all the <a href="motion%20%28democracy%29">motions</a> and amendments that have been moved that day. This "Decision Time" is heralded by the sounding of the division bell, which is heard throughout the Parliamentary campus and alerts MSPs who are not in the chamber to return and vote. At Decision Time, the Presiding Officer puts questions on the motions and amendments by reading out the name of the motion or amendment as well as the proposer and asking ""Are we all agreed?"", to which the chamber first votes orally. If there is audible dissent, the Presiding Officer announces ""There will be a division"" and members vote by means of electronic consoles on their desks. Each MSP has a unique access card with a <a href="integrated%20circuit">microchip</a> which, when inserted into the console, identifies them and allows them to vote. As a result, the outcome of each division is known in seconds.

The outcome of most votes can be predicted beforehand since political parties normally instruct members which way to vote. Parties entrust some MSPs, known as <a href="whip%20%28politics%29">whips</a>, with the task of ensuring that party members vote according to the party line. MSPs do not tend to vote against such instructions, since those who do are unlikely to reach higher political ranks in their parties. Errant members can be deselected as official party candidates during future elections, and, in serious cases, may be expelled from their parties outright. Thus, as with many Parliaments, the independence of Members of the Scottish Parliament tends to be low, and backbench rebellions by members who are discontent with their party's policies are rare. In some circumstances, however, parties announce "free votes", which allows Members to vote as they please. This is typically done on <a href="morality">moral</a> issues.

Immediately after Decision Time a "Members Debate" is held, which lasts for 45 minutes. Members Business is a debate on a motion proposed by an MSP who is not a <a href="Scottish%20Executive">Scottish minister</a>. Such motions are on issues which may be of interest to a particular area such as a member's own constituency, an upcoming or past event or any other item which would otherwise not be accorded official parliamentary time. As well as the proposer, other members normally contribute to the debate. The relevant minister, whose department the debate and motion relate to "winds up" the debate by speaking after all other participants.

Much of the work of the Scottish Parliament is done in <a href="committee">committee</a>. The role of committees is stronger in the Scottish Parliament than in other parliamentary systems, partly as a means of strengthening the role of backbenchers in their scrutiny of the government and partly to compensate for the fact that there is no revising chamber. The principal role of committees in the Scottish Parliament is to take evidence from witnesses, conduct inquiries and scrutinise legislation. Committee meetings take place on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morning when Parliament is sitting. Committees can also meet at other locations throughout Scotland.

Committees comprise a small number of MSPs, with membership reflecting the balance of parties across Parliament. There are different committees with their functions set out in different ways. Mandatory Committees are committees which are set down under the Scottish Parliament's standing orders, which govern their remits and proceedings. The current Mandatory Committees in the fourth Session of the Scottish Parliament are: Public <a href="Audit">Audit</a>; Equal Opportunities; <a href="Politics%20of%20Europe">European</a> and External Relations; Finance; Public Petitions; Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments; and Delegated Powers and Law Reform.

Subject Committees are established at the beginning of each parliamentary session, and again the members on each committee reflect the balance of parties across Parliament. Typically each committee corresponds with one (or more) of the departments (or ministries) of the Scottish Government. The current Subject Committees in the fourth Session are: Economy, Energy and Tourism; <a href="Education%20in%20Scotland">Education and Culture</a>; <a href="NHS%20Scotland">Health and Sport</a>; <a href="Scots%20Law">Justice</a>; <a href="Local%20government%20in%20Scotland">Local Government and Regeneration</a>; Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment; Welfare Reform; and <a href="Transport%20in%20Scotland">Infrastructure and Capital Investment</a>.

A further type of committee is normally set up to scrutinise <a href="private%20bill">private bill</a>s submitted to the Scottish Parliament by an outside party or promoter who is not a member of the Scottish Parliament or Scottish Government. Private bills normally relate to large-scale development projects such as infrastructure projects that require the use of land or property. Private Bill Committees have been set up to consider legislation on issues such as the development of the <a href="Edinburgh%20Tram%20Network">Edinburgh Tram Network</a>, the <a href="Glasgow%20Airport%20Rail%20Link">Glasgow Airport Rail Link</a>, the <a href="Airdrie-Bathgate%20Rail%20Link">Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link</a> and extensions to the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Scotland">National Gallery of Scotland</a>.

The <a href="Scotland%20Act%201998">Scotland Act 1998</a>, which was passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom and given <a href="royal%20assent">royal assent</a> by Queen Elizabeth II on 19 November 1998, governs the functions and role of the Scottish Parliament and delimits its legislative competence. The <a href="Scotland%20Act%202012">Scotland Act 2012</a> and the <a href="Scotland%20Act%202016">Scotland Act 2016</a> extended the devolved competencies. For the purposes of <a href="parliamentary%20sovereignty">parliamentary sovereignty</a>, the Parliament of the United Kingdom at Westminster continues to constitute the supreme legislature of Scotland. However, under the terms of the Scotland Acts, Westminster agreed to devolve some of its responsibilities over Scottish domestic policy to the Scottish Parliament. Such "devolved matters" include education, health, <a href="Scottish%20Executive%20Environment%20and%20Rural%20Affairs%20Department">agriculture</a> and justice. The Scotland Act 1998 enabled the Scottish Parliament to pass <a href="primary%20legislation">primary legislation</a> on these issues. A degree of domestic authority, and all <a href="Foreign%20relations%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">foreign policy</a>, remain with the UK Parliament in Westminster. The Scottish Parliament has the power to pass laws and has tax powers. Another of the roles of the Parliament is to hold the Scottish Government to account.

The specific devolved matters are all subjects which are not explicitly stated in Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act as <a href="reserved%20and%20excepted%20matters">reserved matters</a>. All matters that are not specifically reserved are automatically devolved to the Scottish Parliament. Most importantly, this includes agriculture, fisheries and forestry, <a href="Economy%20of%20Scotland">economic development</a>, education, environment, food standards, consumer advocacy, health, home affairs, <a href="Scots%20law">legal system</a>, <a href="Courts%20in%20Scotland">courts</a>, legal profession, police and fire services, prisons, control of air guns, local government, <a href="Sport%20in%20Scotland">sport</a> and the arts, many aspects of transport (including rail franchising), training, <a href="Tourism%20in%20Scotland">tourism</a>, research and statistics, social work, and some powers over social security. In terms of tax powers, the Scottish Parliament has full control over income tax rates and thresholds on all non-savings and non-dividend income liable for tax by taxpayers resident in Scotland. The Scottish Parliament also has full control over <a href="Land%20and%20Buildings%20Transaction%20Tax">Land and Buildings Transaction Tax</a> and <a href="Scottish%20Landfill%20Tax">Scottish Landfill Tax</a>.

Reserved matters are subjects that are outside the legislative competence of the Scotland Parliament. The Scottish Parliament is unable to legislate on such issues that are reserved to, and dealt with at, Westminster (and where Ministerial functions usually lie with UK Government ministers). These include <a href="Media%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">broadcasting</a> policy, <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Civil%20Service">civil service</a>, common markets for UK goods and services, <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">constitution</a>, <a href="Energy%20use%20and%20conservation%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">electricity</a>, coal, oil, gas, <a href="Nuclear%20power%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">nuclear energy</a>, <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">defence</a> and national security, <a href="Misuse%20of%20Drugs%20Act%201971">drug policy</a>, employment, foreign policy and relations with Europe, welfare, reserved tax powers, most aspects of <a href="Transport%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">transport</a> safety and regulation, <a href="National%20Lottery%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">National Lottery</a>, protection of borders, most aspects of <a href="National%20Insurance">social security</a> and stability of UK's fiscal, <a href="Economy%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">economic</a> and <a href="Banknotes%20of%20the%20pound%20sterling">monetary</a> system.

Members of the public take part in Parliament in two ways that are not the case at Westminster: a public <a href="petition">petition</a>ing system, and cross-party groups on policy topics which the interested public join and attend meetings of, alongside MSPs. The Parliament is able to debate any issue (including those reserved to Westminster) but is unable to make laws on issues that are outside its legislative competence.

As the Scottish Parliament is able to make laws on the areas constitutionally devolved to it, the legislative process begins with <a href="bill%20%28proposed%20law%29">bills</a> (draft laws) which are presented to Parliament.

Bills can be introduced to Parliament in a number of ways; the Scottish Government can introduce new laws or amendments to existing laws as a bill; a committee of the Parliament can present a bill in one of the areas under its remit; a member of the Scottish Parliament can introduce a bill as a private member; or a <a href="private%20bill">private bill</a> can be submitted to Parliament by an outside proposer. Most draft laws are government bills introduced by ministers in the governing party (or parties). Bills pass through Parliament in a number of stages before receiving royal assent, whereupon they become <a href="Acts%20of%20the%20Scottish%20Parliament">Acts of the Scottish Parliament</a>.

The party, or parties, that hold the majority of seats in the Parliament forms the <a href="Scottish%20Government">Scottish Government</a>. In contrast to many other parliamentary systems, Parliament elects a <a href="First%20Minister%20of%20Scotland">First Minister</a> from a number of candidates at the beginning of each parliamentary term (after a <a href="Elections%20in%20Scotland">general election</a>). Any member can put their name forward to be First Minister, and a vote is taken by all members of Parliament. Normally, the leader of the largest party is returned as First Minister, and head of the Scottish Government. Theoretically, Parliament also elects the Scottish Ministers who form the government of Scotland and sit in the Scottish cabinet, but such ministers are, in practice, appointed to their roles by the First Minister. Junior ministers, who do not attend cabinet, are also appointed to assist Scottish ministers in their departments. Most ministers and their juniors are drawn from amongst the elected MSPs, with the exception of Scotland's Chief Law Officers: the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General. Whilst the First Minister chooses the ministers – and may decide to remove them at any time – the formal appointment or dismissal is made by the Sovereign.

Under the Scotland Act 1998, ordinary general elections for the Scottish Parliament are held on the first Thursday in May every four years (<a href="Scottish%20Parliament%20election%2C%201999">1999</a>, <a href="Scottish%20Parliament%20election%2C%202003">2003</a>, <a href="Scottish%20Parliament%20election%2C%202007">2007</a> and so on). The date of the poll may be varied by up to one month either way by the Monarch on the proposal of the Presiding Officer. If the Parliament itself resolves that it should be dissolved (with at least two-thirds of the Members voting in favour), or if the Parliament fails to nominate one of its members to be First Minister within 28 days of a General Election or of the position becoming vacant, the Presiding Officer proposes a date for an extraordinary general election and the Parliament is dissolved by the Queen by <a href="royal%20proclamation">royal proclamation</a>. Extraordinary general elections are in addition to ordinary general elections, unless held less than six months before the due date of an ordinary general election, in which case they supplant it. The following ordinary election reverts to the first Thursday in May, a multiple of four years after 1999 (i.e., 5 May 2011, 7 May 2015, etc.).

Several procedures enable the Scottish Parliament to scrutinise the Government. The First Minister or members of the cabinet can deliver statements to Parliament upon which MSPs are invited to question. For example, at the beginning of each parliamentary year, the First Minister delivers a statement to the chamber setting out the Government's legislative programme for the forthcoming year. After the statement has been delivered, the leaders of the opposition parties and other MSPs question the First Minister on issues related to the substance of the statement.

Parliamentary time is also set aside for question periods in the debating chamber. A "General Question Time" takes place on a Thursday between 11:40 a.m. and noon where members can direct questions to any member of the Scottish Government. At 2:30 pm, a 40-minute-long themed "Question Time" takes place, where members can ask questions of ministers in departments that are selected for questioning that sitting day, such as health and justice or education and transport. Between noon and 12:30 p.m. on Thursdays, when Parliament is sitting, <a href="First%20Minister%27s%20Question%20Time%20%28Scotland%29">First Minister's Question Time</a> takes place. This gives members an opportunity to question the First Minister directly on issues under their jurisdiction.

Members who wish to ask general or themed questions, or questions of the First Minister, must lodge them with parliamentary clerks beforehand and selections are made by the Presiding Officer. Written questions may also be submitted by members to ministers. Written questions and answers are published in the "Official Report".

Elections for the Scottish Parliament were amongst the first in Britain to use a <a href="mixed%20member%20proportional%20representation">mixed member proportional representation</a> (MMP) system. The system is a form of the <a href="Additional%20Member%20System">additional member</a> method (AMS) of <a href="proportional%20representation">proportional representation</a>, and is better known as such in Britain. Under the system, voters are given two votes: one for a specific candidate and one for a political party.

Of the 129 MSPs, 73 are elected to represent <a href="plurality%20voting%20system">first past the post</a> <a href="Scottish%20Parliament%20constituencies%20and%20regions">constituencies</a> and are known as "Constituency MSPs". Voters choose one member to represent the constituency, and the member with most votes is returned as a constituency MSP. The 73 Scottish Parliament constituencies shared the same boundaries as the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20constituencies">UK Parliament constituencies</a> in Scotland, prior to the 2005 reduction in the number of Scottish MPs, with the exception of <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a> and <a href="Shetland">Shetland</a> which each return their own constituency MSP. Currently, the average Scottish Parliament constituency comprises 55,000 electors. Given the geographical distribution of <a href="Demographics%20of%20Scotland">population in Scotland</a>, this results in constituencies of a smaller area in the <a href="Central%20Lowlands">Central Lowlands</a>, where the bulk of Scotland's population live, and much larger constituency areas in the north and west of the country, which have a low population density. The island archipelagos of Orkney, Shetland and the <a href="Western%20Isles%20%28Scottish%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Western Isles</a> comprise a much smaller number of electors, due to their dispersed population. If a Constituency MSP resigns from Parliament, this triggers a by-election in his or her constituency, where a replacement MSP is returned from one of the parties by the plurality system.

The remaining 56 MSPs, called "List MSPs", are elected by an additional members system, which seeks to make the overall results more proportional, countering any distortions in the constituency results. Seven List MSPs are elected from each of eight <a href="Scottish%20Parliament%20constituencies%20and%20regions%23Regions">electoral regions</a>, of which constituencies are sub-divisions:
Each political party draws up a list of candidates standing in each electoral region, from which the List MSPs are elected. When a List MSP resigns, the next person on the resigning MSPs' party's list takes the seat.

The total number of seats in the Parliament are allocated to parties proportionally to the number of votes received in the second vote of the ballot using the <a href="d%27Hondt%20method">d'Hondt method</a>. For example, to determine who is awarded the first list seat, the number of list votes cast for each party is divided by one plus the number of seats the party won in the region (at this point just constituency seats). The party with the highest quotient is awarded the seat, which is then added to its constituency seats in allocating the second seat. This is repeated <a href="Iterated%20function">iteratively</a> until all available list seats are allocated. As the allocation of seats to parties mirrors the popular vote, it is commonplace for the most successful party in the election not to win an outright majority of the seats, thereby requiring them to  seek some form and level of cross-party support for their initiatives in government. Nonetheless, the 2011 election saw the SNP become the first–and to date, only–party to win a majority government.

As in the House of Commons, a number of qualifications apply to being an MSP. Such qualifications were introduced under the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20Disqualification%20Act%201975">House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975</a> and the <a href="British%20Nationality%20Act%201981">British Nationality Act 1981</a>. Specifically, members must be over the age of 18 and must be a <a href="British%20nationality%20law">citizen of the United Kingdom</a>, the Republic of Ireland, one of the countries in the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a>, a citizen of a <a href="British%20overseas%20territory">British overseas territory</a>, or a <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> citizen resident in the UK. Members of the police and the armed forces are disqualified from sitting in the Scottish Parliament as elected MSPs, and similarly, civil servants and members of foreign legislatures are disqualified. An individual may not sit in the Scottish Parliament if he or she is judged to be insane under the terms of the <a href="Mental%20Health%20%28Care%20and%20Treatment%29%20%28Scotland%29%20Act%202003">Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003</a>.

There have been five elections to the Parliament, in <a href="Scottish%20Parliament%20election%2C%201999">1999</a>, <a href="Scottish%20Parliament%20election%2C%202003">2003</a>, <a href="Scottish%20Parliament%20election%2C%202007">2007</a>, <a href="Scottish%20Parliament%20general%20election%2C%202011">2011</a> and <a href="Scottish%20Parliament%20election%2C%202016">2016</a>.

The <a href="next%20Scottish%20Parliament%20election">next Scottish Parliament election</a> is due to be held on Thursday 6 May 2021. Under the <a href="Scotland%20Act%201998">Scotland Act 1998</a>, an ordinary general election to the Scottish Parliament would normally have been held on the first Thursday in May four years after the <a href="Scottish%20Parliament%20election%2C%202016">2016 election</a>, i.e. in May 2020. This would have clashed with the proposed date of the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202017">2020 United Kingdom general election</a>, but later became a moot point after the latter was brought forward to 2017. In November 2015, the Scottish Government published a Scottish Elections (Dates) Bill, which proposed to extend the term of the Parliament to five years. That Bill was passed by the Scottish Parliament on 25 February 2016 and received Royal Assent on 30 March 2016, setting the new date for the election as 6 May 2021, with subsequent elections every four years after that.

As with all elections in the UK, Irish and qualifying <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> citizens are entitled to vote. Unlike elections to <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">the Westminster parliament</a>, citizens of other non-Commonwealth <a href="Member%20state%20of%20the%20European%20Union">EU member states</a> who are resident in Scotland are entitled to vote in elections to the Scottish Parliament. Overseas electors on Scottish <a href="electoral%20register">electoral register</a>s are not allowed to vote in Scottish Parliament elections. From the <a href="Scottish%20Parliament%20election%2C%202016">2016</a> election, the franchise for Scottish Parliament elections was expanded to include 16 and 17-year olds.

The resignation of <a href="Henry%20McLeish">Henry McLeish</a> as First Minister, brought on by an <a href="Officegate">office expenses scandal</a>, generated controversy in the first years of the Scottish Parliament. Various academics have written on how the Scottish Parliament can be improved as a governing institution.

A procedural consequence of the establishment of the Scottish Parliament is that Scottish MPs sitting in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">UK House of Commons</a> have been able to vote on domestic legislation that applies only to England, Wales and Northern Ireland – whilst English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish Westminster MPs are unable to vote on the domestic legislation of the Scottish Parliament. This phenomenon is known as the West Lothian question and has led to criticism. Following the Conservative victory in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202015">2015 UK election</a>, <a href="Parliamentary%20procedure">standing orders</a> of the House of Commons were changed to give MPs representing English constituencies a new "veto" over laws only affecting England, known as <a href="English%20votes%20for%20English%20laws">English votes for English laws</a>.

Rod Steiger

Rodney Stephen Steiger (April 14, 1925July 9, 2002) was an American actor, noted for his portrayal of offbeat, often volatile and crazed characters. Cited as "one of Hollywood's most charismatic and dynamic stars", he is closely associated with the art of <a href="method%20acting">method acting</a>, embodying the characters he played, which at times led to clashes with directors and co-stars. He starred as <a href="Marlon%20Brando">Marlon Brando</a>'s mobster brother Charley in "<a href="On%20the%20Waterfront">On the Waterfront</a>" (1954), the title character Sol Nazerman in "<a href="The%20Pawnbroker%20%28film%29">The Pawnbroker</a>" (1964), and as police chief Bill Gillespie opposite <a href="Sidney%20Poitier">Sidney Poitier</a> in the film "<a href="In%20the%20Heat%20of%20the%20Night%20%28film%29">In the Heat of the Night</a>" (1967) which won him the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Academy Award for Best Actor</a>.

Steiger was born in <a href="Westhampton%2C%20New%20York">Westhampton, New York</a>, the son of a <a href="Vaudeville">vaudevillian</a>. He had a difficult childhood, with an <a href="Alcoholism">alcoholic</a> mother from whom he ran away at the age of 16. After serving in the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean%20theater%20of%20World%20War%20II">South Pacific Theater</a> during World War II, he began his acting career with television roles in 1947, and went on to garner critical acclaim for his portrayal of the main character in the teleplay "<a href="Marty%20%28teleplay%29">Marty</a>" (1953). He made his stage debut in 1946, in a production of "Curse you, Jack Dalton!" at the Civic Repertory Theatre of Newark, and subsequently appeared in productions such as "<a href="An%20Enemy%20of%20the%20People">An Enemy of the People</a>" (1950), <a href="Clifford%20Odets">Clifford Odets</a>'s "<a href="Night%20Music%20%28play%29">Night Music</a>" (1951), "<a href="Seagulls%20Over%20Sorrento%23Original%20Play">Seagulls Over Sorrento</a>" (1952) and "<a href="Rashomon%20%28play%29">Rashomon</a>" (1959).

Steiger made his film debut in <a href="Fred%20Zinnemann">Fred Zinnemann</a>'s "<a href="Teresa%20%281951%20film%29">Teresa</a>" in 1951, and subsequently appeared in films such as "<a href="The%20Big%20Knife">The Big Knife</a>" (1955), "<a href="Oklahoma%21%20%281955%20film%29">Oklahoma!</a>" (1955), "<a href="Across%20the%20Bridge%20%28film%29">Across the Bridge</a>" (1957) and "<a href="Al%20Capone%20%28film%29">Al Capone</a>" (1959). After Steiger's performance in "The Pawnbroker" in 1964, in which he played an embittered Jewish <a href="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> survivor working as a pawnbroker in New York City, he portrayed an opportunistic Russian politician in <a href="David%20Lean">David Lean</a>'s "<a href="Doctor%20Zhivago%20%28film%29">Doctor Zhivago</a>" (1965). "In the Heat of the Night" (1967) won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Steiger, who was lauded for his performance as a Mississippi police chief who learns to respect an African-American officer (Poitier) as they search for a killer. The following year, he played a serial killer of many guises in "<a href="No%20Way%20to%20Treat%20a%20Lady%20%28film%29">No Way to Treat a Lady</a>".

During the 1970s, Steiger increasingly turned to European productions in his search for more demanding roles. He portrayed <a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> in "<a href="Waterloo%20%281970%20film%29">Waterloo</a>" (1970), a Mexican bandit in <a href="Sergio%20Leone">Sergio Leone</a>'s "<a href="Duck%2C%20You%20Sucker%21">Duck, You Sucker!</a>" (1971), <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> in "<a href="Last%20Days%20of%20Mussolini">Last Days of Mussolini</a>" (1975), and ended the decade playing a disturbed priest in " <a href="The%20Amityville%20Horror%20%281979%20film%29">The Amityville Horror</a>" (1979). By the 1980s, heart problems and depression took its toll on Steiger's career, and he found it difficult to find employment, agreeing to appear in low-budget <a href="B%20movie">B movie</a>s. One of his final roles was as judge <a href="H.%20Lee%20Sarokin">H. Lee Sarokin</a> in the prison drama "<a href="The%20Hurricane%20%281999%20film%29">The Hurricane</a>" (1999), which reunited him with "In the Heat of the Night" director <a href="Norman%20Jewison">Norman Jewison</a>. Steiger was married five times, and had a daughter, opera singer <a href="Anna%20Steiger">Anna Steiger</a>, and a son, Michael Steiger. He died of <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> and kidney failure as a result of complications from surgery for a <a href="gall%20bladder">gall bladder</a> tumor on July 9, 2002, aged 77, in Los Angeles, and was survived by his fifth wife <a href="Joan%20Benedict%20Steiger">Joan Benedict Steiger</a>.

Steiger was born on April 14, 1925 in <a href="Westhampton%2C%20New%20York">Westhampton, New York</a>, the only child of Lorraine (<a href="married%20and%20maiden%20names">née</a> Driver) and Frederick Steiger, of <a href="French%20people">French</a>, <a href="Scottish%20people">Scottish</a> and <a href="Germans">German</a> descent. Rod was raised as a <a href="Lutheranism">Lutheran</a>. He never knew his father, a <a href="Vaudeville">vaudevillian</a> who had been part of a traveling song-and-dance team with Steiger's mother, but was told that he was a handsome Latino-looking man, who was a talented musician and dancer. Biographer Tom Hutchinson describes him as a "shadowy, fugitive figure", one who "haunted" Rod throughout his life and was an "invisible presence and unseen influence".

Hutchinson described Steiger's mother as "plump, energetic and small, with long auburn hair". She had a good singing voice and nearly became a Hollywood actress, but after a leg surgery permanently impaired her walking ability, she gave up acting and turned to alcohol. As a result, she quit show business and moved away from Westhampton to raise her son. They moved through several towns, including <a href="Irvington%2C%20New%20Jersey">Irvington</a> and <a href="Bloomfield%2C%20New%20Jersey">Bloomfield</a>, before settling in <a href="Newark%2C%20New%20Jersey">Newark, New Jersey</a>. Her alcoholism caused Steiger much embarrassment, and the family was frequently mocked by other children and their parents within the community. At the age of five he was sexually abused by a pedophile who lured him in with a butterfly collection. Steiger said of his troubled family background: "If you had the choice of having the childhood you experienced, with your alcoholic mother and being the famous actor you are today, or having a loving, secure childhood and not being famous, which would you take? A loving, secure childhood in a New York minute". During the last 11 years of her life, Steiger's mother stayed sober and regularly attended <a href="Alcoholics%20Anonymous">Alcoholics Anonymous</a> meetings. Steiger recalled: "I was so proud of her. She turned herself around. She came alive again".

During his childhood, and owing to his considerable strength and bulk, Steiger became known as "The Rock". Despite being mocked over his mother's alcoholism, he was a popular figure at school and an able softball player. He displayed an interest in writing poetry and acting during his adolescent years, and appeared in several school plays while at <a href="West%20Side%20High%20School%20%28New%20Jersey%29">West Side High School</a> in Newark. Tired of fighting with his mother, he ran away from home at age sixteen to join the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

He enlisted on May 11, 1942, and received his training at the <a href="U.S.%20Naval%20Training%20Station">U.S. Naval Training Station</a> in <a href="Newport%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Newport, Rhode Island</a>. He joined the newly commissioned <a href="USS%20Taussig%20%28DD-746%29">USS "Taussig" (DD-746)</a> on May 20, 1944. While serving as a <a href="Torpedoman%27s%20mate">torpedoman</a> on <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s, he saw action in the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean%20theater%20of%20World%20War%20II">South Pacific</a>, including the <a href="Battle%20of%20Iwo%20Jima">Battle of Iwo Jima</a>. Steiger later commented: "I loved the Navy. I was stupid enough to think I was being heroic". His experiences during the war haunted him for the rest of his life, particularly the loss of Americans during the Battle of Iwo Jima, as well as the sinking of vessels by the "Taussig" which were known to have women and children aboard. On December 17, 1944, off the coast of <a href="Luzon">Luzon</a> in the Philippines, Steiger and the "Taussig" encountered a <a href="Typhoon%20Cobra%20%281944%29">severe typhoon</a>, which became known as <a href="Typhoon%20Cobra">"Halsey's Typhoon"</a>, with winds reaching one hundred knots (115 mph) and waves. As a result, three U.S. destroyers were lost, but the "Taussig" survived, with Steiger tying a rope to himself on deck and flattening himself as waves engulfed the ship.

After the war, the <a href="GI%20Bill">GI Bill</a> paid for his rent at a room on West 81st Street in New York City, an income of just over $100 a month, and four years of schooling. He initially found a job oiling machines and washing floors. He decided to attend a drama class, primarily because of its membership of attractive young women. Known as the Civil Service Little Theater group, it was conducted by the Office of Dependants and Beneficiaries, where he was employed at the time. This led him to start a two-year course at the <a href="The%20New%20School">New School for Social Research</a>, run by German émigré <a href="Erwin%20Piscator">Erwin Piscator</a>. During one audition, Steiger was cast after barely uttering a few words, the director exclaiming he had a "fresh, wonderful quality". Another talented pupil at the time was <a href="Walter%20Matthau">Walter Matthau</a>, who dubbed the institution "The Neurotic School for Sexual Research". Steiger was surprised to discover his own talent as an actor, and he was encouraged to pursue further studies at the Dramatic Workshop. One of the main reasons he wanted to be an actor was to regain public respect for his family name, which had so humiliated him during childhood. Another important factor was his belief that he did not "have the temperament for a regular job", and would have ended up a miserable, violent alcoholic. His only role model as an actor was <a href="Paul%20Muni">Paul Muni</a>, who he thought was "the greatest", though he also had a deep respect for French actor <a href="Harry%20Baur">Harry Baur</a> and, according to biographer Hutchinson, he admired <a href="Charlie%20Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a> "to the point of adoration".

Steiger made his stage debut in a production of "Curse you, Jack Dalton!" (1946) at the Civic Repertory Theatre of Newark. Subsequent to this, he received an invitation from one of his teachers, <a href="Daniel%20Mann">Daniel Mann</a>, to attend the <a href="Actors%20Studio">Actors Studio</a>, established by <a href="Elia%20Kazan">Elia Kazan</a> in October 1947. It was here, along with <a href="Marlon%20Brando">Marlon Brando</a>, <a href="Karl%20Malden">Karl Malden</a> and <a href="Eli%20Wallach">Eli Wallach</a>, that he studied <a href="method%20acting">method acting</a>, which became deeply engrained in him. Lacking matinée idol looks, much like Malden and Wallach, he began pursuing a career as a character actor rather than as a leading man. Steiger's stage work continued in 1950, with a minor role as a townperson in a stage production of "<a href="An%20Enemy%20of%20the%20People">An Enemy of the People</a>" at the <a href="Music%20Box%20Theatre">Music Box Theatre</a>. His first major role on Broadway came in <a href="Clifford%20Odets">Clifford Odets</a>'s production of "<a href="Night%20Music%20%28play%29">Night Music</a>" (1951), where he played A. L. Rosenberger. The play was held at the <a href="ANTA%20Playhouse">ANTA Playhouse</a>. The following year, he played a telegraphist in the play "<a href="Seagulls%20Over%20Sorrento%23Original%20Play">Seagulls Over Sorrento</a>", performed at the <a href="John%20Golden%20Theatre">John Golden Theatre</a> beginning on September 11, 1952.

Steiger's early roles, although minor, were numerous, especially in television series during the early 1950s, when he appeared in more than 250 live television productions over a five-year period. He was spotted by <a href="Fred%20Coe">Fred Coe</a>, NBC's manager of program development, who increasingly gave him bigger parts. Steiger considered television to be what <a href="repertory%20theatre">repertory theatre</a> had been for an earlier generation, and saw it as a place where he could test his talent with a plethora of different roles. Soon afterward he began receiving positive reviews from critics such as <a href="John%20Crosby%20%28media%20critic%29">John Crosby</a>, who noted that Steiger regularly gave "effortless persuasive performances". Among Steiger's credits were "<a href="Danger%20%28TV%20series%29">Danger</a>" (1950–53), "<a href="Lux%20Video%20Theatre">Lux Video Theatre</a>" (1951), "<a href="Out%20There%20%281951%20TV%20series%29">Out There</a>" (1951), "<a href="Tales%20of%20Tomorrow">Tales of Tomorrow</a>" (1952–53), "<a href="The%20Gulf%20Playhouse">The Gulf Playhouse</a>" (1953), "<a href="Medallion%20Theatre">Medallion Theatre</a>" (1953), "<a href="Goodyear%20Television%20Playhouse">Goodyear Television Playhouse</a>" (1953), and as <a href="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>'s Romeo in "The First Command Performance of Romeo and Juliet (1957)" episode of "<a href="You%20Are%20There%20%28series%29">You Are There</a>" in 1954, under director <a href="Sidney%20Lumet">Sidney Lumet</a>. He continued to make appearances in various playhouse television productions, appearing in five episodes of "<a href="Kraft%20Theatre">Kraft Theatre</a>" (1952–54), which earned him praise from critics, six episodes of "<a href="The%20Philco%20Television%20Playhouse">The Philco Television Playhouse</a>" (1951–55) and two episodes of "<a href="Schlitz%20Playhouse%20of%20Stars">Schlitz Playhouse of Stars</a>" (1957–58). Steiger made his big screen debut in 1953, with a small role in <a href="Fred%20Zinnemann">Fred Zinnemann</a>'s "<a href="Teresa%20%28film%29">Teresa</a>", shot in 1951. Steiger, who described himself as "cocky", won over Zinnemann by praising his direction. Zinnemann recalled that Steiger was "very popular, extremely articulate and full of remarkable memories", and the two remained highly respectful of each other for life.

On May 24, 1953, Steiger played the title role in <a href="Paddy%20Chayefsky">Paddy Chayefsky</a>'s "<a href="Marty%20%28teleplay%29">Marty</a>" episode of the Goodyear Television Playhouse. The role had originally been intended for <a href="Martin%20Ritt">Martin Ritt</a>, who later became a director. "Marty" is the story of a lonely and homely butcher from <a href="the%20Bronx">the Bronx</a> in search of love. The play was a critical success that increased Steiger's public exposure; <a href="Tom%20Stempel">Tom Stempel</a> noted that he brought "striking intensity to his performance as Marty, particularly in giving us Marty's pain". As Steiger refused to sign a seven-year studio contract, he was replaced with <a href="Ernest%20Borgnine">Ernest Borgnine</a> in the film "<a href="Marty%20%28film%29">Marty</a>" (1955), which won the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Academy Award for Best Picture</a>, as well as the Best Actor Oscar for Borgnine. 1953 proved to be Steiger's breakthrough year; he garnered <a href="Sylvania%20Award">Sylvania Award</a>s for "Marty" and four other best performances of the year—as Vishinsky and <a href="Rudolf%20Hess">Rudolf Hess</a> in two episodes of "You Are There", as gangster Dutch Schultz in a thriller, and as a radar operator in "My Brother's Keeper".

For his role as Charley "the Gent", the brother of Marlon Brando's character in Elia Kazan's "<a href="On%20the%20Waterfront">On the Waterfront</a>" (1954), Steiger was nominated for the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actor">Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor</a>. Film writer <a href="Leo%20Braudy">Leo Braudy</a> wrote that the "incessantly repeated images of its taxicab confrontation between Brando and Rod Steiger have made the film iconic". The taxicab scene took eleven hours to shoot and was heavily scripted, despite Brando fuelling the popular myth in his autobiography that the scene was improvised. Brando stated that seven takes were needed because Steiger could not stop crying, which Steiger found to be unfair and inaccurate. Though Steiger retained great respect for Brando as an actor, he disliked him as a person and frequently complained during the production of Brando's "predilection for leaving the set" immediately after shooting his scenes. Steiger later remarked: "We didn't get to know each other at all. He always flew solo and I haven't seen him since the film. I do resent him saying he's just a hooker, and that actors are whores". Steiger also responded unfavorably when he learned that Kazan had been awarded an honorary Oscar by the Academy in 1999. In a 1999 interview with "<a href="BBC%20News">BBC News</a>", Steiger said he probably would not have done "On the Waterfront" if he had known at the time that Kazan provided the <a href="House%20Un-American%20Activities%20Committee">House Un-American Activities Committee</a> with names of performers suspected of being Communists.

Steiger played Jud Fry in the film version of the <a href="Rodgers%20and%20Hammerstein">Rodgers and Hammerstein</a> musical "<a href="Oklahoma%21%20%281955%20film%29">Oklahoma!</a>" (1955), in which he performed his own singing. It was one of the biggest location film productions of the 1950s, shot near <a href="Nogales%2C%20Arizona">Nogales, Arizona</a> with a crew of 325 people and some 70 trucks. Steiger portrayed a disturbed, emotionally isolated version of Jud, which television channel <a href="Turner%20Classic%20Movies">Turner Classic Movies</a> (TCM) believed brought a "complexity to the character that went far beyond the stock musical villain". Steiger observed that <a href="James%20Dean">James Dean</a>, who auditioned for the role that went to <a href="Gordon%20MacRae">Gordon MacRae</a>, was a "nice kid absorbed by his own ego, so much so that it was destroying him", which he thought led to his death. Dean reportedly gave Steiger his prized copy of <a href="Ernest%20Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>'s book "<a href="Death%20in%20the%20Afternoon">Death in the Afternoon</a>", and had underlined every appearance of the word "death".

Later in 1955, Steiger played an obnoxious film tycoon, loosely based on Columbia boss <a href="Harry%20Cohn">Harry Cohn</a>, opposite <a href="Jack%20Palance">Jack Palance</a> and <a href="Ida%20Lupino">Ida Lupino</a> in <a href="Robert%20Aldrich">Robert Aldrich</a>'s <a href="film%20noir">film noir</a> "<a href="The%20Big%20Knife">The Big Knife</a>". Steiger bleached his hair for the part, sought inspiration for the role from Russian actor <a href="Vladimir%20Sokoloff">Vladimir Sokoloff</a>, read a book about the <a href="Treblinka%20extermination%20camp">Treblinka extermination camp</a> to understand his character thoroughly, and visited the perfume department of a store in <a href="Beverly%20Hills%2C%20California">Beverly Hills, California</a>, to try to understand his character's contempt for women. Steiger and Palance did not get along during the production, and in one scene Palance threw several <a href="Gramophone%20record">record albums</a> at Steiger in frustration, feeling that he was trying to steal the scene. Steiger earned critical acclaim later that year for a role as a prosecuting major in <a href="Otto%20Preminger">Otto Preminger</a>'s "<a href="The%20Court-Martial%20of%20Billy%20Mitchell">The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell</a>", alongside <a href="Gary%20Cooper">Gary Cooper</a> and <a href="Charles%20Bickford">Charles Bickford</a>.

Steiger portrayed the character "Pinky" in <a href="Columbia%20Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a>' western, "<a href="Jubal%20%28film%29">Jubal</a>" (1956), which co-starred <a href="Glenn%20Ford">Glenn Ford</a> and Ernest Borgnine. Steiger's character is a rancher, a "sneering baddie", who becomes jealous when his former mistress becomes attracted to Ford's character.. Ford noted Steiger's deep commitment to method acting during production, considering him to be a "fine actor but a real strange fellow". Steiger disliked the experience and frequently clashed with director <a href="Delmer%20Daves">Delmer Daves</a>, who was more favorable to Ford's lighthearted take on the film. Upon its release in April 1956, a writer for "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" was impressed with the "evil venom" displayed by his character, and remarked that there had not "been as hateful a screen heavy around in a long time". In <a href="Mark%20Robson">Mark Robson</a>'s "<a href="The%20Harder%20They%20Fall">The Harder They Fall</a>", Steiger played a crooked boxing promoter who hires a sports journalist (<a href="Humphrey%20Bogart">Humphrey Bogart</a> in his last role). Steiger referred to Bogart as "a professional" who had "tremendous authority" during filming.

Steiger appeared in three films released in 1957. The first was <a href="John%20Farrow">John Farrow</a>'s film noir "<a href="The%20Unholy%20Wife">The Unholy Wife</a>", in which he played a wealthy <a href="Napa%20Valley%20AVA">Napa Valley</a> vintner who marries a "<a href="femme%20fatale">femme fatale</a>" named Phyllis (<a href="Diana%20Dors">Diana Dors</a>). In its original review of the film, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" described Steiger's performance as "curious" further stating that the actor's voice modulation "ranges from Marlon Brando to Ronald Colman and back." During the production of <a href="Samuel%20Fuller">Samuel Fuller</a>'s "<a href="Run%20of%20the%20Arrow">Run of the Arrow</a>", in which he played a confederate veteran who refuses to accept defeat following the surrender of <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">General Robert E. Lee</a> at <a href="Battle%20of%20Appomattox%20Courthouse">Appomattox</a> at the end of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, Steiger badly sprained his ankle before shooting one of the battle scenes and was unable to walk, let alone run. Fuller instead got one of the Native American extras to run in Steiger's place, which is why the scene was shot showing only the feet, instead of using close-ups. Steiger had researched the history behind the film and decided to play the character as an Irishman, becoming "the first Irish cowboy" as he put it. Later that year, Steiger took the lead role in the British thriller "<a href="Across%20the%20Bridge%20%28film%29">Across the Bridge</a>", in which he played a German conman with British citizenship who goes into hiding in Mexico after embezzling company funds. Film critic <a href="Dennis%20Schwartz">Dennis Schwartz</a> stated that Steiger gave "one of his greatest performances".

Steiger portrayed a mastermind criminal seeking to obtain a $500,000 ransom, opposite <a href="James%20Mason">James Mason</a> and <a href="Inger%20Stevens">Inger Stevens</a>, in <a href="Andrew%20L.%20Stone">Andrew L. Stone</a>'s "<a href="Cry%20Terror%21">Cry Terror!</a>" (1958) for <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a>. <a href="Paul%20Beckley">Paul Beckley</a> of the "<a href="New%20York%20Herald%20Tribune">Herald Tribune</a>" had thought Steiger "superbly laconic", but Dennis Schwartz dismissed the film as "an ill-conceived attempt" with "too many coincidences and contrived plot points to sustain interest". The following year, Steiger appeared with <a href="Claire%20Bloom">Claire Bloom</a> (whom he later married) in a <a href="Fay%20Kanin">Fay</a> and <a href="Michael%20Kanin">Michael Kanin</a> stage production of <a href="Akira%20Kurosawa">Akira Kurosawa</a>'s <a href="Rashomon">1950 film</a>, "<a href="Rashomon%20%28play%29">Rashomon</a>", where he enacted the role of the bandit originally played by <a href="Toshiro%20Mifune">Toshiro Mifune</a>. A major success, it was lauded by critics and nominated for three <a href="Tony%20award">Tony award</a>s. Robert Coleman of the "<a href="Daily%20Mirror">Daily Mirror</a>" described Steiger's performance as "magnificently animalish", while <a href="Kenneth%20Tynan">Kenneth Tynan</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" thought the acting helped set new standards for Broadway. The same year, Steiger portrayed iconic mobster <a href="Al%20Capone">Al Capone</a> in the <a href="Al%20Capone%20%28film%29">film of the same name</a>. Steiger was particularly keen on demonstrating the showiness of Capone, speaking thunderously, slinging a camel-hair coat over his shoulders and wearing his hat at a jaunty angle. The film, noted for its deglamorized portrayal of the subject, earned Steiger a <a href="Laurel%20Awards">Laurel Award for Best Male Dramatic Performance</a> nomination. Though Hutchinson, author of "Rod Steiger: Memoirs of a friendship", perceived Steiger's portrayal of Capone to be more of a caricature, George Anastasia and Glen Macnow, authors of the book "The Ultimate Book of Gangster Movies", described it as one of the best screen portrayals of Capone.

Following the success of "Al Capone", Steiger played sophisticated thief Paul Mason, who masterminds a caper to steal $4 million in French francs from the underground vault of the casino of <a href="Monte%20Carlo">Monte Carlo</a>, in the <a href="Henry%20Hathaway">Henry Hathaway</a> heist film "<a href="Seven%20Thieves">Seven Thieves</a>" (1960). <a href="Bosley%20Crowther">Bosley Crowther</a> of "The New York Times" gave a positive review of the film, praising the "nerve-rackingly delicate plot" and the "most elaborate roles" of Steiger and his co-star, <a href="Edward%20G.%20Robinson">Edward G. Robinson</a>. The following year, he took the part of a prison psychiatrist who tries to cure the psychological demons of <a href="Stuart%20Whitman">Stuart Whitman</a>'s character in "<a href="The%20Mark%20%281961%20film%29">The Mark</a>". Steiger's performance was so convincing that, after the film was released, he received a call from a psychiatric institution asking him to attend one of their board meetings. "The Mark" was followed by a role in the European film production of "<a href="World%20in%20My%20Pocket">World in My Pocket</a>" alongside <a href="Nadja%20Tiller">Nadja Tiller</a>. Steiger increasingly played in films in Italy and France during this period. Not only did he believe he had greater credibility and esteem as an actor in Europe, but he approved of the more relaxed filming schedule prevalent there at that time.

In 1962, Steiger appeared on Broadway in "<a href="Moby%20Dick%E2%80%94Rehearsed">Moby Dick—Rehearsed</a>", at the <a href="Ethel%20Barrymore%20Theatre">Ethel Barrymore Theatre</a>, as well as playing a detective searching for a scientist's (<a href="Alan%20Ladd">Alan Ladd</a>'s) mugger in <a href="Philip%20Leacock">Philip Leacock</a>'s "<a href="13%20West%20Street">13 West Street</a>" for Columbia Pictures. Steiger played a small role of a destroyer commander among the large ensemble cast of "<a href="The%20Longest%20Day%20%28film%29">The Longest Day</a>", which included <a href="John%20Wayne">John Wayne</a>, <a href="Richard%20Todd">Richard Todd</a>, <a href="Robert%20Mitchum">Robert Mitchum</a>, <a href="Richard%20Burton">Richard Burton</a>, <a href="Sean%20Connery">Sean Connery</a> and <a href="Henry%20Fonda">Henry Fonda</a>. According to co-star Richard Burton, Steiger had privately admitted to him that he was in financial trouble at the time and had a face lift, which Burton thought made him look like "one half of a naked ass-hole". The following year, Steiger played ruthless <a href="Naples">Neapolitan</a> land developer and city councilman Edoardo Nottola, who uses his political power to make personal profit in a large scale <a href="suburb">suburb</a>an real estate deal, in <a href="Francesco%20Rosi">Francesco Rosi</a>'s Italian production, "<a href="Hands%20over%20the%20City">Hands over the City</a>" (1963). According to biographer Francesco Bolzoni, Rosi had cast Steiger in the Italian language film because he had wanted "a rich interpreter of great capacity" in the part of the land developer.

Shortly after "Hands over the City", Steiger agreed to appear in another Italian film, "<a href="Time%20of%20Indifference">Time of Indifference</a>" (1964), in which he starred opposite <a href="Claudia%20Cardinale">Claudia Cardinale</a> and <a href="Shelley%20Winters">Shelley Winters</a>. Though Steiger's powerful performance was unaffected, the production was marred by a dispute between director <a href="Francesco%20Maselli">Francesco Maselli</a> and producer <a href="Franco%20Cristaldi">Franco Cristaldi</a>, with one wanting it to be a purely political film and the other wanting emphasis on the erotic subplot and his relationship with Cardinale. In Sidney Lumet's gritty drama "<a href="The%20Pawnbroker%20%28film%29">The Pawnbroker</a>" (1964), Steiger played an embittered, emotionally withdrawn survivor of <a href="the%20Holocaust">the Holocaust</a> living in New York City. Richard Harland Smith of TCM notes that Steiger's career was waning at the time, and he had to "scramble for paying gigs for a decade" before getting this part. Steiger agreed to a reduced fee of $50,000. He read <a href="The%20Pawnbroker">Edward Lewis Wallant's novel</a> and the script many times to develop an intimate understanding of the character, and insisted on reducing his lines to make his character more realistic and alienated from society. Lumet noted that during the production Steiger had a tendency to be overly dramatic, stating: "Sure, Rod has weaknesses of rhetoric, but you can talk them through with him. I explained that this solitary Jew could not rise to heights of emotion; he had been hammered by life and by people. The faith he had to find was in other people, because God had betrayed him."

Steiger remarked of the film: "I think my best work is in "The Pawnbroker". The last scene, where I find the boy dead on the street. I think that's the highest moment, whatever it may be, with my talent." He drew upon inspiration for this climactic scene, in which he appears to show his frustration through a silent scream, from <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Picasso</a>'s "<a href="Guernica%20%28Picasso%29">Guernica</a>", which depicts war-ravaged villagers. <a href="Cecil%20Wilson%20%28journalist%29">Cecil Wilson</a> of the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" wrote that Steiger's character "seems to encompass all the agony ever inflicted on man". Although the film attracted controversy and was accused of <a href="anti-Semitism">anti-Semitism</a>, Steiger was widely acclaimed for his performance, which garnered him the prize for Best Actor at the <a href="Berlin%20International%20Film%20Festival">Berlin International Film Festival</a> and his second Best Actor nomination at the Oscars. Steiger was so certain that he had produced an Oscar-winning performance that he was shocked when he lost to <a href="Lee%20Marvin">Lee Marvin</a>.

In 1965, Steiger played an effeminate embalmer in <a href="Tony%20Richardson">Tony Richardson</a>'s comedy "<a href="The%20Loved%20One%20%28film%29">The Loved One</a>", about the funeral business in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, based on the <a href="The%20Loved%20One">1948 short satirical novel</a> by <a href="Evelyn%20Waugh">Evelyn Waugh</a>. His curly-haired appearance in the film was modeled on a bust of <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> he once saw while meeting Richardson. Steiger offended Bosley Crowther of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", who found his character repellent. His next role, as Komarovsky, a Russian politician and "villainous opportunist" who rapes <a href="Julie%20Christie">Julie Christie</a>'s character in <a href="David%20Lean">David Lean</a>'s "<a href="Doctor%20Zhivago%20%28film%29">Doctor Zhivago</a>" (1965), was one of his favorites. Steiger, one of only two Americans in the cast, was initially apprehensive about working with such great British actors as <a href="Ralph%20Richardson">Ralph Richardson</a> and <a href="Alec%20Guinness">Alec Guinness</a>, and was pleased when the film was completed that he did not stand out as an American. The film was the biggest international box office draw of the 1960s, grossing $200 million worldwide. It has since been acclaimed as one of the <a href="List%20of%20films%20considered%20the%20best">greatest films ever made</a>, and in 1998 was selected as the 39th best American film in the original <a href="AFI%27s%20100%20Years...100%20Movies">AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies</a> list by the <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a>.
Steiger had intended returning to the stage, and had signed on to play the title character in <a href="Bertolt%20Brecht">Bertolt Brecht</a>'s "<a href="Galileo">Galileo</a>", at the <a href="Lincoln%20Center%20Repertory%20Company">Lincoln Center Repertory Company</a> in April 1967, but the production was cancelled when he became ill. Steiger won the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Chief of Police Bill Gillespie in "<a href="In%20the%20Heat%20of%20the%20Night%20%28film%29">In the Heat of the Night</a>", opposite <a href="Sidney%20Poitier">Sidney Poitier</a>. He played a Southern police chief searching for a murderer. Prejudiced against blacks, he jumps to the conclusion that the culprit is Virgil Tibbs (Poitier), an African-American man passing through town after visiting his mother, who later turns out to be an experienced homicide detective from <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. The film deals with the way the two men interact and join forces in solving the crime, as Steiger's Gillespie learns to greatly respect the black man he initially took to be a criminal. Steiger drew upon his experience in the Navy with a Southerner named "King", remembering his accent. Poitier considered Steiger and <a href="Spencer%20Tracy">Spencer Tracy</a> to have been the finest actors he had ever worked with, remarking in 1995, "He's so good he made me dig into bags I never knew I had." A. D. Murphy of "Variety" described Steiger's performance as "outstanding", writing: "Steiger's transformation from a diehard Dixie bigot to a man who learns to respect Poitier stands out in smooth comparison to the wandering solution of the murder." Steiger won a plethora of other awards, including a <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor%20in%20a%20Leading%20Role">BAFTA</a>, a <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor%20-%20Motion%20Picture%20Drama">Golden Globe</a>, a <a href="Laurel%20Award">Laurel Award</a> and awards for Best Actor from the <a href="National%20Society%20of%20Film%20Critics%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">National Society of Film Critics</a> and the <a href="New%20York%20Film%20Critics%20Circle%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">New York Film Critics Circle</a>.

In 1968, Steiger played a serial killer opposite <a href="George%20Segal">George Segal</a> in <a href="Jack%20Smight">Jack Smight</a>'s black comedy thriller "<a href="No%20Way%20to%20Treat%20a%20Lady%20%28film%29">No Way to Treat a Lady</a>". During the course of the film, he adopts various disguises, including those of an Irish priest, a New York City policeman, a German plumber, and a gay hairdresser, to avoid being identified, and to put his victims at ease, before strangling them and painting a pair of lips on their foreheads with garish red lipstick. The film and Steiger's performance were critically acclaimed, with <a href="Vincent%20Canby">Vincent Canby</a> of "The New York Times" highlighting Steiger's "beautifully uninhibited performance as a hammy", and a writer for "<a href="Time%20Out%20%28magazine%29">Time Out</a>" describing him as "brilliant as a sort of <a href="Boston%20strangler">Boston strangler</a>, son of a great actress who has left her boy with a mother fixation". Later in 1968, Steiger played a repressed gay <a href="non-commissioned%20officer">non-commissioned officer</a> opposite <a href="John%20Phillip%20Law">John Phillip Law</a> in <a href="John%20Flynn%20%28director%29">John Flynn</a>'s "<a href="The%20Sergeant%20%28film%29">The Sergeant</a>" for <a href="Warner%20Bros.-Seven%20Arts">Warner Bros.-Seven Arts</a>, which earned him the <a href="David%20di%20Donatello%20for%20Best%20Foreign%20Actor">David di Donatello Award for Best Foreign Actor</a>. Despite the award win, film critic <a href="Pauline%20Kael">Pauline Kael</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" was particularly critical of the casting of Steiger as a homosexual and felt that he was "totally outside his range", to which Steiger concurred that he was ineffective.

Steiger was cast as a short-tempered tattooed man with soon-to-be ex-wife Claire Bloom in the science fiction picture "<a href="The%20Illustrated%20Man%20%28film%29">The Illustrated Man</a>" (1969). The film was a critical and commercial failure, and <a href="Ray%20Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a>, who wrote the screenplay, said: "Rod was very good in it, but it wasn't a good film...the script was terrible". Steiger had better luck alongside Bloom later that year in <a href="Peter%20Hall%20%28director%29">Peter Hall</a>'s British drama "<a href="Three%20into%20Two%20Won%27t%20Go">Three into Two Won't Go</a>", playing an Irishman who cheats on his wife with a young hiker. It was entered into the <a href="19th%20Berlin%20International%20Film%20Festival">Berlin International Film Festival</a> and became the 19th most popular film at the UK box office in 1969.

Steiger was offered the title role in "<a href="Patton%20%28film%29">Patton</a>" (1970), but turned it down because he did not want to glorify war. The role was then given to <a href="George%20C.%20Scott">George C. Scott</a>, who won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance. Steiger called this refusal his "dumbest career move", remarking, "I got on my high horse. I thought I was a pacifist." Instead, he chose to portray <a href="Napoleon%20I%20of%20France">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> opposite <a href="Christopher%20Plummer">Christopher Plummer</a> in <a href="Sergei%20Bondarchuk">Sergei Bondarchuk</a>'s "<a href="Waterloo%20%281970%20film%29">Waterloo</a>" (1970), a co-production between the Soviet Union and Italy. One commentator wrote: "I watched with extraordinary respect, no, that is not the right word, with enthusiasm, the acting of Rod Steiger in the role of Napoleon in Waterloo," while literary critic <a href="Daniel%20S.%20Burt">Daniel S. Burt</a> describes Steiger's Napoleon as an "unusual interpretation", finding him less convincing than Plummer's <a href="Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington">Wellington</a>.

In 1971, Steiger played a chauvinistic big game hunter, explorer and war hero opposite <a href="Susannah%20York">Susannah York</a> in Mark Robson's "<a href="Happy%20Birthday%2C%20Wanda%20June">Happy Birthday, Wanda June</a>", before agreeing to star alongside <a href="James%20Coburn">James Coburn</a> as Mexican bandit Juan Miranda in <a href="Sergio%20Leone">Sergio Leone</a>'s "<a href="Duck%2C%20You%20Sucker%21">Duck, You Sucker!</a>", which was alternatively titled "A Fistful of Dynamite". Leone was initially dissatisfied with his performance in that he played his character as a serious, <a href="Emiliano%20Zapata">Zapata</a>-like figure. As a result, tension grew between Steiger and Leone, including one incident that ended with Steiger walking off during the filming of the scene where Juan's stagecoach is destroyed. After the film's completion, Leone and Steiger were content with the final result, and Steiger praised Leone for his skills as a director. Steiger auditioned for the role of <a href="Michael%20Corleone">Michael Corleone</a> in <a href="Francis%20Ford%20Coppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a>'s "<a href="The%20Godfather">The Godfather</a>" (1972), a film adaptation of <a href="Italian%20American">Italian American</a> author <a href="Mario%20Puzo">Mario Puzo</a>'s <a href="The%20Godfather%20%28novel%29">1969 novel of the same name</a>, but Puzo felt that Steiger was too old for the part and rejected him.

Steiger played a rural <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> patriarch and brother of <a href="Jeff%20Bridges">Jeff Bridges</a>, at odds with Robert Ryan's character, in "<a href="Lolly-Madonna%20XXX">Lolly-Madonna XXX</a>" (1973), which received mixed reviews. Later that year he was cast as the turban-wearing German officer Guenther von Lutz in <a href="Duccio%20Tessari">Duccio Tessari</a>'s Italian war comedy "<a href="The%20Heroes%20%281973%20film%29">The Heroes</a>", opposite <a href="Rod%20Taylor">Rod Taylor</a>, and appeared as "foul-mouthed Sicilian mobster" Eugenio Giannini opposite <a href="Gian%20Maria%20Volont%C3%A8">Gian Maria Volontè</a>'s <a href="Lucky%20Luciano">Lucky Luciano</a> in Francesco Rosi's <a href="Lucky%20Luciano%20%28film%29">film of the same name</a>.

In 1975, Steiger portrayed Italian dictator <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> in <a href="Carlo%20Lizzani">Carlo Lizzani</a>'s "<a href="Last%20Days%20of%20Mussolini">Last Days of Mussolini</a>", which received a positive critical reception. He appeared in <a href="Claude%20Chabrol">Claude Chabrol</a>'s French picture "<a href="Innocents%20with%20Dirty%20Hands">Innocents with Dirty Hands</a>", playing the role of Louis Wormser, the wealthy alcoholic husband of <a href="Romy%20Schneider">Romy Schneider</a>'s character Julie Wormser. It was poorly received by critics, and Steiger found the director, whom he had admired, a bitter disappointment. He was highly critical of Chabrol's lack of communication and aloofness from the production, and preference for playing chess on set instead of talking through scenes. Vincent Canby of "The New York Times" dismissed it as "little more than a soap opera", writing: "The performances are of a piece—uniformly atrocious. Mr. Steiger surpasses his own earlier records for lumbering busyness. Within his first few minutes on screen he (1) gets drunk, (2) whines, (3) pleads for understanding, (4) weeps and (5) goes to bed alone."
Later that year, Steiger starred as an <a href="Irish%20Republican%20Army">Irish Republican Army</a> terrorist who plans to blow up the <a href="Houses%20of%20Parliament">Houses of Parliament</a> in <a href="Don%20Sharp">Don Sharp</a>'s British thriller "<a href="Hennessy%20%28film%29">Hennessy</a>". John Simon of "<a href="New%20York%20Magazine">New York Magazine</a>" wrote: "This fellow Hennessy, as played by Rod Steiger, is about as interesting and likable as a <a href="Guy%20Fawkes">Guy Fawkes</a> dummy."

The following year, Steiger portrayed the comic actor <a href="W.%20C.%20Fields">W. C. Fields</a> in an <a href="Arthur%20Hiller">Arthur Hiller</a> biopic, "<a href="W.%20C.%20Fields%20and%20Me">W. C. Fields and Me</a>", for <a href="Universal%20Pictures">Universal Pictures</a>. The <a href="screenplay">screenplay</a>, which was based on a <a href="memoir">memoir</a> by <a href="Carlotta%20Monti">Carlotta Monti</a>, who was Fields' mistress for the last 14 years of his life, was penned by <a href="Bob%20Merrill">Bob Merrill</a>. Steiger read extensively about Fields in preparation for the role, and developed an encyclopaedic knowledge of his career and personal life. He concluded that he would base his characterization around his performance in "<a href="The%20Bank%20Dick">The Bank Dick</a>" (1940) . One day, Fields' mistress Monti turned up on set, and watched the scene where he briefly thanks everybody. Nervous that she might not approve, he broke down in tears after Monti met him after the scene and fondly said "Woody, Woody, Woody, My Woody", a nickname used only by those very close to Fields. Despite the energy Steiger put into the picture, like the actor's previous recent films, it was poorly received by critics. Canby called it "dreadful" and described Steiger's portrayal of Fields as a "wax dummy of a character". Lucia Bozzola of "The New York Times" later referred to Steiger's portrayal of Fields as "superb", but noted that his Hollywood career had "undeniably fallen from his 1950s and '60s heights".

Steiger played <a href="Pontius%20Pilate">Pontius Pilate</a> in <a href="Franco%20Zeffirelli">Franco Zeffirelli</a>'s TV <a href="miniseries">miniseries</a> "<a href="Jesus%20of%20Nazareth%20%28miniseries%29">Jesus of Nazareth</a>" (1977). <a href="Stacy%20Keach">Stacy Keach</a>, who portrayed <a href="Barabbas">Barabbas</a>, expressed his joy at the opportunity to work with Steiger, describing him as "generous and opinionated". In 1978, Steiger played a senator in Norman Jewison's "<a href="F.I.S.T.">F.I.S.T.</a>", opposite <a href="Sylvester%20Stallone">Sylvester Stallone</a>, who played a Cleveland warehouse worker involved in the labor union leadership of the fictional organisation named Federation of Inter-State Truckers. "<a href="Love%20and%20Bullets%20%281979%20film%29">Love and Bullets</a>", later that year, in which Steiger appeared as a mafia boss, was poorly received; <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> dismissed it as a "hopelessly confused hodgepodge of chases, killings, enigmatic meetings and separations, and insufferably overacted scenes by Steiger alternating with alarmingly underacted scenes by [Charles] Bronson". The following year, Steiger was cast as a general opposite Richard Burton and Robert Mitchum in <a href="Andrew%20V.%20McLaglen">Andrew V. McLaglen</a>'s war film "<a href="Breakthrough%20%281979%20film%29">Breakthrough</a>", set on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28WWII%29">Western Front</a>. In "<a href="The%20Amityville%20Horror%20%281979%20film%29">The Amityville Horror</a>" (1979), Steiger appeared as a disturbed priest, who is invited to perform an <a href="exorcism">exorcism</a> on a haunted house. Again Steiger was accused of overacting; <a href="Janet%20Maslin">Janet Maslin</a> of "The New York Times" wrote: "Mr. Steiger bellows and weeps and overdoes absolutely everything. He won't even pick up the phone before it's rung 12 or 15 times." Pauline Kael thought that Steiger's "spiritual agony was enough to shatter the camera lens".

In 1980, Steiger received two <a href="Genie%20Award%20for%20Best%20Performance%20by%20a%20Foreign%20Actor">Genie Award for Best Performance by a Foreign Actor</a> nominations for his roles in "<a href="Klondike%20Fever">Klondike Fever</a>" and "<a href="The%20Lucky%20Star%20%28film%29">The Lucky Star</a>", both Canadian productions. "Klondike Fever" is based on <a href="Jack%20London">Jack London</a>'s journey from <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> to the <a href="Klondike%2C%20Yukon">Klondike</a> gold fields in 1898. Steiger revisited his role as Mussolini in "<a href="Lion%20of%20the%20Desert">Lion of the Desert</a>", a production that was financed by <a href="Muammar%20Gaddafi">Muammar Gaddafi</a>, and which co-starred <a href="Anthony%20Quinn">Anthony Quinn</a> as <a href="Bedouin">Bedouin</a> tribal leader <a href="Omar%20Mukhtar">Omar Mukhtar</a>, fighting the Italian army in the years leading up to World War II. The Italian authorities reportedly banned the film in 1982, as it was considered damaging to the army, and it was not shown on Italian television until a state visit by Gaddafi in 2009. It received critical acclaim in Britain, where it was praised in particular for the quality of its battle scenes. Later in 1981, Steiger won the <a href="Montreal%20World%20Film%20Festival">Montréal World Film Festival Award for Best Actor</a> for his portrayal of white-bearded Orthodox <a href="rabbi">rabbi</a> Reb Saunders in <a href="Jeremy%20Kagan">Jeremy Kagan</a>'s "<a href="The%20Chosen%20%281981%20film%29">The Chosen</a>". Janet Maslin commented that Steiger's "slow, rolling delivery" was more "numbing than prepossessing", though a critic from "Variety" thought it an "exceptional performance as the somewhat tyrannical but loving patriarch".

After his <a href="open-heart%20surgery">open-heart surgery</a> in 1979, clinical depression and health problems during the 1980s directly affected Steiger's career, and he often turned to <a href="B-movie">B-movie</a>s, low-budget, independent productions and TV miniseries. He admitted that during this period he accepted "everything I was offered", and knew that many of the films he appeared in were not great, but wanted to demonstrate his strong work ethic despite his issues. He later regretted the poorer films in which he appeared during the 1980s, and wished he had done more stage work. He sank into an even deeper depression when he was not involved in acting, but it bothered him more that his acting career had taken a turn for the worse and was no longer challenging. The major studio producers were wary of his problems and considered him a liability. Steiger spoke about the experience to a younger colleague while advising: "Never tell anyone if you've got heart problems, kid. Never." His reputation as a fine character actor remained intact, and <a href="Joel%20Hirschhorn">Joel Hirschhorn</a> at the time considered his talent to be "as strong as ever".

In 1984, Steiger starred as a detective assigned to investigate the murder of a Chicago psychoanalyst (<a href="Roger%20Moore">Roger Moore</a>), a man whom he detests from a previous case, in <a href="Bryan%20Forbes">Bryan Forbes</a>'s "<a href="The%20Naked%20Face%20%28film%29">The Naked Face</a>". <a href="Richard%20Christiansen%20%28critic%29">Richard Christiansen</a> of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" referred to it as a "wimpy suspense movie shot in Chicago in the fall of 1983, [that] doesn't do much good for the city or for anyone connected with it", and considered Steiger to be "acting in his high hysteria gear", who "snarls and whines and overacts". Steiger took a break from cinema in the mid-1980s, during which he appeared in the <a href="ITV%20Yorkshire">Yorkshire Television</a> mini-series "<a href="The%20Glory%20Boys">The Glory Boys</a>" (1984) with <a href="Anthony%20Perkins">Anthony Perkins</a>, and "<a href="Hollywood%20Wives%20%28miniseries%29">Hollywood Wives</a>" (1985) with <a href="Angie%20Dickinson">Angie Dickinson</a>. Steiger and Perkins were at loggerheads during the production of "The Glory Boys". Perkins resented the fact that Steiger insisted on a bigger trailer and felt that Steiger was trying to steal scenes from him, while Steiger had thought Perkins "so jittery and jinxed by the chemicals he was taking" that he felt sorry for him and believed that he was jeopardizing the success of the film. Steiger also performed on <a href="Joni%20Mitchell">Joni Mitchell</a>'s 1985 album <a href="Dog%20Eat%20Dog%20%28Joni%20Mitchell%20album%29">"Dog Eat Dog"</a>, where he provided the voice of an evangelist in the song "Tax Free".

Steiger appeared in the Argentine-American film "<a href="Catch%20the%20Heat">Catch the Heat</a>" (1987), a martial arts picture about a Brazilian drug baroness who smuggles drugs into the United States inside her breast implants. According to director <a href="Fred%20Olen%20Ray">Fred Olen Ray</a>, it was pulled from distribution within a week of release. In 1988, Steiger and <a href="Yvonne%20De%20Carlo">Yvonne De Carlo</a> played a spooky elderly couple with developmentally delayed children in <a href="John%20Hough%20%28director%29">John Hough</a>'s horror film "<a href="American%20Gothic%20%281988%20film%29">American Gothic</a>". Universally panned by the critics, <a href="Caryn%20James">Caryn James</a> of "The New York Times" wrote: "Mr. Steiger addresses the camera as if he were reciting Shakespeare, he is truly, straightforwardly, hilariously bad." During the last year of the decade he played authority figures, including a mayor in "<a href="The%20January%20Man">The January Man</a>", and as Judge Prescott in "<a href="Tennessee%20Waltz%20%28film%29">Tennessee Waltz</a>". Although Steiger admitted that his performance in "The January Man" was "way over the top", he enjoyed the experience, thereby marking a positive turning point after a period of clinical depression.

In 1990, Steiger starred in "<a href="Men%20of%20Respect">Men of Respect</a>", a crime drama film adaptation of William Shakespeare's play "<a href="Macbeth">Macbeth</a>". He played a character based on <a href="King%20Duncan">King Duncan</a>, opposite <a href="John%20Turturro">John Turturro</a> as Mike Battaglia (<a href="Macbeth%20%28character%29">Macbeth</a>), who plays a Mafia hitman who climbs his way to the top by killing Steiger's character. The film was critically panned, with Roger Ebert awarding it one star out of four, describing the concept as a "very, very bad idea". Steiger played another mobster, <a href="Sam%20Giancana">Sam Giancana</a>, two years later in the miniseries "<a href="Sinatra%20%28miniseries%29">Sinatra</a>" (1992).

Steiger portrayed a reverend living in a small town in the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">American South</a> in the macabre <a href="Merchant%20Ivory">Merchant Ivory</a> film production "<a href="The%20Ballad%20of%20the%20Sad%20Caf%C3%A9%20%28film%29">The Ballad of the Sad Café</a>" (1991), co-starring <a href="Vanessa%20Redgrave">Vanessa Redgrave</a> and <a href="Keith%20Carradine">Keith Carradine</a>. The film met with generally lukewarm reviews, though it was entered into the <a href="41st%20Berlin%20International%20Film%20Festival">41st Berlin International Film Festival</a>. Steiger auditioned for the part of an elderly Irishman in <a href="Ron%20Howard">Ron Howard</a>'s "<a href="Far%20and%20Away">Far and Away</a>", starring <a href="Tom%20Cruise">Tom Cruise</a> and <a href="Nicole%20Kidman">Nicole Kidman</a>. Steiger, who had long been bald, was ordered by Howard to wear a wig to the audition. He resented the fact that Howard insisted on taping the audition, which he believed to be a form of humiliation for actors, serving as after-dinner entertainment for the Hollywood executives. Steiger never forgave Howard, whom he referred to as a "cocksucker", for rejecting him for the part and giving it to <a href="Cyril%20Cusack">Cyril Cusack</a>.

In 1993, Steiger portrayed an aging <a href="Gynaecology">gynaecologist</a> who terrorizes his urban neighbors in a rural community in <a href="Burlington%2C%20Vermont">Burlington, Vermont</a> in "<a href="The%20Neighbor%20%281993%20film%29">The Neighbor</a>". Dennis Schwartz considered it to have been one of Steiger's creepiest roles, though he thought that the poor script had rendered the role awkward and "mildly entertaining in the sense that Steiger is asked to carry the film and hams it up". The following year, Steiger agreed to play the role of a Cuban mob boss opposite Sylvester Stallone and <a href="Sharon%20Stone">Sharon Stone</a> in <a href="Luis%20Llosa">Luis Llosa</a>'s thriller "<a href="The%20Specialist">The Specialist</a>", citing its purpose as a "$40 million commercial" to show a new generation that he existed. Critics panned the film, which has a four percent approval rating on <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> based on 27 reviews as of July 2015. The role earned Steiger a <a href="Golden%20Raspberry%20Award%20for%20Worst%20Supporting%20Actor">Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor</a> nomination, and the film was listed in "<a href="The%20Official%20Razzie%20Movie%20Guide">The Official Razzie Movie Guide</a>" as one of "The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made".

Following "The Specialist" (1994), Steiger appeared in "<a href="Tom%20Clancy%27s%20Op%20Center%20%28film%29">Tom Clancy's Op Center</a>" (1995), a film that was edited down into a TV miniseries, and featured in a "<a href="Columbo%20%28TV%20series%29">Columbo</a>" television film, "<a href="List%20of%20Columbo%20episodes%23Season%2010%20and%20specials">Strange Bedfellows</a>". The following year, he took a minor role as Doc Wallace in the <a href="Dale%20Rosenbloom">Dale Rosenbloom</a> family drama "<a href="Shiloh%20%28film%29">Shiloh</a>". He reprised the role three years later in . Also in 1996, Steiger played a "jingoistic top general" who "petitions the president to go nuclear in the middle of a global crisis" in the ensemble production of "<a href="Mars%20Attacks%21">Mars Attacks!</a>".

In 1997, Steiger played Tony Vago, the mob boss of <a href="Vincent%20Gallo">Vincent Gallo</a>'s character in <a href="Kiefer%20Sutherland">Kiefer Sutherland</a>'s "<a href="Truth%20or%20Consequences%2C%20N.M.%20%28film%29">Truth or Consequences, N.M.</a>", a gritty "noir" about a drug heist gone wrong. Steiger played judges in <a href="Antonio%20Banderas">Antonio Banderas</a>'s comedy-drama "<a href="Crazy%20in%20Alabama">Crazy in Alabama</a>" and in the prison drama, "<a href="The%20Hurricane%20%281999%20film%29">The Hurricane</a>", both in 1999, the latter of which tells the story of former middleweight boxer <a href="Rubin%20Carter">Rubin Carter</a>, who was wrongly convicted of a triple homicide in a bar in <a href="Paterson%2C%20New%20Jersey">Paterson, New Jersey</a>. "The Hurricane" reunited Steiger with Norman Jewison, who had directed him in "In the Heat of the Night". Steiger portrayed <a href="H.%20Lee%20Sarokin">H. Lee Sarokin</a>, the judge responsible for freeing Carter. Sarokin thought it was a "marvellous film" that was Oscar-worthy, but found Steiger's portrayal as overacted and a "little arrogant and pompous".

After a minor role as a "bombastic priest" in "<a href="End%20of%20Days%20%28film%29">End of Days</a>" (1999), Steiger was one of the lead actors in <a href="Burt%20Reynolds">Burt Reynolds</a>'s "<a href="The%20Last%20Producer">The Last Producer</a>" (2000), a film about a washed-up, veteran producer (Reynolds) who tries to re-enter the movie business by producing a new film. Steiger's last film role was as the <a href="billiard%20hall">billiard hall</a> manager, Nick, in "<a href="Poolhall%20Junkies">Poolhall Junkies</a>" (2002); it was poorly received by critics.

Steiger was married five times: he married actress Sally Gracie (1952–1958), actress <a href="Claire%20Bloom">Claire Bloom</a> (1959–1969), secretary Sherry Nelson (1973–1979), singer Paula Ellis (1986–1997) and actress <a href="Joan%20Benedict%20Steiger">Joan Benedict Steiger</a> (married 2000 until his death). He had a daughter, opera singer <a href="Anna%20Steiger">Anna Steiger</a> (born in 1960) by Bloom, and a son, Michael Steiger (born in 1993), from his marriage to Ellis. In an interview with journalist <a href="Kenneth%20Passingham">Kenneth Passingham</a>, Steiger stated that Bloom was "all I ever wanted in a woman", and that "maybe our marriage was better than most because we were both established when we met". The couple bought a home in <a href="Malibu%2C%20California">Malibu, California</a>, a community that appealed to Steiger but which Bloom found boring. They also purchased an apartment in Manhattan and a cottage in <a href="County%20Galway">County Galway</a>, in close proximity to <a href="John%20Huston">John Huston</a>'s home. Financial considerations led Steiger to sell their New York apartment in the mid-1970s. It upset him greatly when his marriage with Bloom ended in 1969 and that she quickly remarried Broadway producer <a href="Hillard%20Elkins">Hillard Elkins</a> the same year, a man whom Steiger had entrusted to care for her while he was away shooting "Waterloo". Steiger was also close friends with actress <a href="Elizabeth%20Taylor">Elizabeth Taylor</a>.

Steiger was outspoken on <a href="McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a>. He was particularly critical of <a href="Charlton%20Heston">Charlton Heston</a>'s stance on weapons, and publicly referred to him as "America's favorite fascist". In one clash in a column in the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>", Steiger responded to a letter sent by Heston saying that he was shocked that the American Film Institute had not honored Elia Kazan because of his testimony to the Un-American Activities Committee. Steiger wrote that he was "appalled, appalled, appalled" at actors and writers who had been forced to drive cabs because they were blacklisted and had even committed suicide as a result. Heston did not reply.

Steiger suffered from <a href="depression%20%28mood%29">depression</a> throughout much of his life. He described himself as "incapacitated for about eight years with clinical depression" before his Oscar win for "In The Heat of the Night". His career problems from the 1970s onwards were often exacerbated by health issues. He underwent open-heart surgery in 1976 and again in 1979 and struggled with obesity, though certain roles, such as Napoleon, required him to intentionally gain weight. After the decline of his third marriage in 1979, a deep depression, partly a side effect of his surgery, during the 1980s negatively affected his career. He became increasingly reclusive during this period, often confining himself to his apartment, watching <a href="American%20football">American football</a> for several hours. He said of the experience: "You begin to lose self-esteem. You don't walk, you don't shave and if no one was watching you'd go to the bathroom right where you were sitting". He would lie in bed at night thinking "You'll never act again. Why bother? You're no good". Despite these challenges, Steiger continued to act into the 1990s and early 2000s. In one of his final interviews, he stated that there was a stigma wrongfully attached to sufferers of depression and that it was caused by a chemical imbalance, not a mental disease. He commented: "Pain must never be a source of shame. It's a part of life, it's part of humanity."

Rod Steiger died of <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> and kidney failure at age 77, as a result of complications from surgery for a <a href="gall%20bladder">gall bladder</a> <a href="tumor">tumor</a> on July 9, 2002, in a Westside hospital in Los Angeles, and was buried in <a href="Forest%20Lawn%20Memorial%20Park%20%28Hollywood%20Hills%29">Forest Lawn – Hollywood Hills Cemetery</a>. The film "<a href="Saving%20Shiloh">Saving Shiloh</a>", released in 2006, was dedicated to his memory.

Steiger was one of Hollywood's most respected character actors; Hutchinson described him as "one of Hollywood's most charismatic and dynamic stars". Yet for Hutchinson, Steiger remained "out of sympathy with Hollywood" during his career, believing that accomplished actors often struggle to find challenging films as they got older. Steiger was an "effusive talent" according to Lucia Bozzola of "The New York Times", and was particularly noted for his intense portrayal of offbeat, often volatile and crazed characters. After "On the Waterfront" (1954), Steiger became somewhat typecast for playing tough characters and villains, and grew increasingly frustrated playing the "Mafia heavy or a near-psychopath" during the 1970s, roles which he could play menacingly, but provided little opportunity for him to showcase his talent. Gossip columnist <a href="Louella%20Parsons">Louella Parsons</a> hailed him as "the Screen's No.1 Bad Man", while the newspaper "<a href="London%20Evening%20News">London Evening News</a>" referred to him as "the man you would love to hate if you had the coverage". A 1960 publication by Dean Jennings of "<a href="The%20Saturday%20Evening%20Post">The Saturday Evening Post</a>" referred to Steiger as an "angry, hot-tempered newcomer of prodigious acting talents, [who] works best only at emotional white heat", and remarked that he found it "stimulating to carry theatrical fantasy into his private life". Pauline Kael found his performances so powerful that she believed he "often seems to take over a picture even when he isn't in the lead". The journal "<a href="Hansom%20Books">Films and Filming</a>", surveying his career in 1971, noted that his talent "developed steadily through films good and bad", and that the secret of his success was that he stayed grounded, citing a 1956 interview where he said "I pity the player who can't keep his feet on the ground. It's too easy to trade on success and forget that no performer can stand still."

A product of the Actors Studio, Steiger is closely associated with method acting, embodying the characters he played. Writer James F. Scott notes that during his career, he "many times put aside his own personality to think his way into an alien psyche". Steiger once said:

Steiger was so devoted to his craft that during the 1970s he turned to many foreign productions, especially in Italy, to obtain the sort of roles he desired, but often clashed with directors over his method acting techniques. In one of his last interviews, Steiger said: "What is the greatest thing an artist in any profession can give to a person?—that would be a constructive, warm memory. Because that gets into your brain and therefore into your life, so to speak. And that's it, when somebody says to me 'I'll never forget', that's worth more to me than five Academy Awards, I'm in that person's life".

Film writer Paul Simpson notes how closely Steiger prepared for his roles, and how he "effortlessly" recreated the mannerisms of figures such as Mussolini, in a "compelling take on an enigmatic figure". Judith Crist of "New York Magazine", reviewing "Duck, You Sucker!", commented that Steiger was "totally without mannerisms, always with manner", and noted that his "silences are stunningly effective". Roger Ebert later echoed this statement, concurring that Steiger lacked mannerisms, writing, "When he gets a character worth playing with, he creates it new from the bottom up, out of whole cloth. I don't know how he does it. It's almost as if he gets inside the skin of the guy he's playing and starts being that person for a while". Steiger said: "I always tried to do things different. If I got a role which was similar to another I'd try to do it a little different." His explosive screen performances were an influence on many later actors, including <a href="Robert%20De%20Niro">Robert De Niro</a>, who used Steiger's portrayal of Al Capone as a reference for his own performance in "<a href="The%20Untouchables%20%28film%29">The Untouchables</a>" (1987). <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a> was highly impressed with Steiger's "powerful and wrenching performance" in "The Pawnbroker".

Despite Steiger's acclaim as an actor, he was frequently accused of overacting and won his fair share of critics, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s. His acting was so dynamic at times that critics found him excessive and overbearing, and even uncomfortable or laughable to watch. Steiger once clashed with Armenian director <a href="Rouben%20Mamoulian">Rouben Mamoulian</a>, during a theatrical production of "Oklahoma!", as he was intolerant of Steiger's "unusual acting technique". Steiger ignored the director's concerns that he was mumbling his lines, and when he began chomping loudly on an apple during a scene with Gordon MacRae, Mamoulian exclaimed: "Get out of my theater. Get out of my life!", and fired him. Even Kazan found several of the Actors Studio's techniques disagreeable, preferring "more humor and verve and less self-indulgence, self-pity and self-awareness". Kazan felt that Steiger often displayed a competitive edge as an actor and tried to steal scenes from his co-stars. Steiger rejected these claims, insisting that he was merely "trying to take the medium of acting to as far as I can go, and that why I sometimes go over the edge".

Several co-stars found working with Steiger difficult; <a href="Warren%20Oates">Warren Oates</a>, according to director Norman Jewison, viewed Steiger as "somebody who had a tendency to go over the top" during the making of "In The Heat of the Night". Writer Richard Dyer highlights the contrast in the film between the acting styles of Steiger and Poitier, with "Poitier's stillness and implied intensity" and "Steiger's busy, exteriorised method acting". Humphrey Bogart, Steiger's co-star of "The Harder They Fall", referred to Steiger's method acting as the "scratch-your-ass-and-mumble school of acting". Director Robert Aldrich notes that Steiger had a habit of changing his lines, which often confused his co-stars. Aldrich stated: "Usually I lie awake at nights trying to think of ways to improve an actor's performance. With Steiger, the problem is to try and contain him". Steiger was particularly aggressive towards director Kenneth Annakin during the making of "Across the Bridge", insisting on rewriting most of the script and changing many of the lines to better fit Steiger's idea of the character. Annakin stated that he had "never known an actor to put so much thought and preparation into a performance" as Steiger. Hutchinson revealed that Steiger often suffered from panic during filming and that fear of failure haunted him throughout his life, but fear also provided him with a source of strength in his acting.

Alcibiades

Alcibiades, son of Cleinias ( 450–404 BC), from the <a href="deme">deme</a> of <a href="Scambonidae">Scambonidae</a>, was a prominent <a href="History%20of%20Athens">Athenian</a> <a href="wikt%3Astatesman">statesman</a>, <a href="Public%20speaking">orator</a>, and <a href="General%20officer">general</a>. He was the last famous member of his mother's aristocratic family, the <a href="Alcmaeonidae">Alcmaeonidae</a>, which fell from prominence after the <a href="Peloponnesian%20War">Peloponnesian War</a>. He played a major role in the second half of that conflict as a strategic advisor, military commander, and politician.

During the course of the Peloponnesian War, Alcibiades changed his political allegiance several times. In his native Athens in the early 410s BC, he advocated an aggressive foreign policy and was a prominent proponent of the <a href="Sicilian%20Expedition">Sicilian Expedition</a>, but he fled to <a href="History%20of%20Sparta">Sparta</a> after his political enemies brought charges of <a href="sacrilege">sacrilege</a> against him. In Sparta, he served as a strategic adviser, proposing or supervising several major campaigns against Athens. In Sparta too, however, Alcibiades soon made powerful enemies and felt forced to defect to <a href="Achaemenid%20Dynasty">Persia</a>. There he served as an adviser to the <a href="satrap">satrap</a> <a href="Tissaphernes">Tissaphernes</a> until his Athenian political allies brought about his recall. He then served as an Athenian general (<a href="Strategos">Strategos</a>) for several years, but his enemies eventually succeeded in exiling him a second time.

Scholars have argued that had the Sicilian expedition been under Alcibiades's command instead of that of <a href="Nicias">Nicias</a>, the expedition might not have met its eventual disastrous fate. In the years when he served Sparta, Alcibiades played a significant role in Athens's undoing; the capture of <a href="Decelea">Decelea</a> and the revolts of several critical Athenian subjects occurred either at his suggestion or under his supervision. Once restored to his native city, however, he played a crucial role in a string of Athenian victories that eventually brought Sparta to seek a peace with Athens. He favored unconventional tactics, frequently winning cities over by treachery or negotiation rather than by <a href="siege">siege</a>. Alcibiades's military and political talents frequently proved valuable to whichever <a href="polis">state</a> currently held his allegiance, but his propensity for making powerful enemies ensured that he never remained in one place for long; and by the end of the war that he had helped to rekindle in the early 410s, his days of political relevance were a bygone memory.

Alcibiades was born in <a href="Classical%20Athens">Athens</a>. His father was <a href="Cleinias">Cleinias</a>, who had distinguished himself in the <a href="Greco-Persian%20Wars">Persian War</a> both as a fighter himself and by personally subsidizing the cost of a <a href="trireme">trireme</a>. The family of Cleinias had old connections with the Spartan aristocracy through a relationship of "<a href="Xenia%20%28Greek%29">xenia</a>", and the name "Alcibiades" was of Spartan origin. Alcibiades' mother was <a href="Deinomache">Deinomache</a>, the daughter of <a href="Megacles">Megacles</a>, head of the powerful <a href="Alcmaeonidae">Alcmaeonid</a> family, and could trace her family back to <a href="Eurysaces">Eurysaces</a> and the <a href="Ajax%20the%20Great">Telamonian Ajax</a>. Alcibiades thereby, through his mother, belonged to the powerful and controversial family of the <a href="Alcmaeonidae">Alcmaeonidae</a>; the renowned <a href="Pericles">Pericles</a> and his brother Ariphron were Deinomache's cousins, as her father and their mother were siblings. His maternal grandfather, also named Alcibiades, was a friend of <a href="Cleisthenes">Cleisthenes</a>, the famous constitutional reformer of the late 6th century BC. After the death of Cleinias at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Coronea%20%28447%20BC%29">Battle of Coronea (447 BC)</a>, Pericles and Ariphron became his guardians.

According to <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>, Alcibiades had several famous teachers, including <a href="Socrates">Socrates</a>, and was well trained in the art of <a href="Rhetoric">Rhetoric</a>. He was noted, however, for his unruly behavior, which was mentioned by ancient Greek and Latin writers on several occasions. It was believed that Socrates took Alcibiades as a student because he believed he could change Alcibiades from his vain ways. <a href="Xenophon">Xenophon</a> attempted to clear Socrates' name at trial by relaying information that Alcibiades was always corrupt and that Socrates merely failed in attempting to teach him morality.

Alcibiades took part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Potidaea">Battle of Potidaea</a> in 432 BC, where Socrates was said to have saved his life and again at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Delium">Battle of Delium</a> in 424 BC. Alcibiades had a particularly close relationship with Socrates, whom he admired and respected. According to Plutarch, Alcibiades "feared and reverenced Socrates alone, and despised the rest of his lovers".

Alcibiades was married to <a href="Hipparete">Hipparete</a>, the daughter of <a href="Hipponicus">Hipponicus</a>, a wealthy Athenian. His bride brought with her a large dowry, which significantly increased Alcibiades' already substantial family fortune. According to Plutarch, Hipparete loved her husband, but she attempted to divorce him because he consorted with <a href="courtesan">courtesan</a>s but prevented her from appearing at court. He seized her in court and carried her home again through the crowded <a href="Agora">Agora</a>. She lived with him until her death, which came soon after, and gave birth to two children, a daughter and a son, <a href="Alcibiades%20the%20Younger">Alcibiades the Younger</a>. Alcibiades was famed throughout his life for his physical attractiveness, of which he was inordinately vain.

Alcibiades first rose to prominence when he began advocating aggressive Athenian action after the signing of the <a href="Peace%20of%20Nicias">Peace of Nicias</a>. That treaty, an uneasy truce between Sparta and Athens signed midway through the Peloponnesian War, came at the end of seven years of fighting during which neither side had gained a decisive advantage. Historians Arnold W. Gomme and <a href="Raphael%20Sealey">Raphael Sealey</a> believe, and <a href="Thucydides">Thucydides</a> reports, that Alcibiades was offended that the Spartans had negotiated that treaty through Nicias and <a href="Laches%20%28person%29">Laches</a>, overlooking him on account of his youth.

Disputes over the interpretation of the treaty led the Spartans to dispatch ambassadors to Athens with full powers to arrange all unsettled matters. The Athenians initially received these ambassadors well, but Alcibiades met with them in secret before they were to speak to the <a href="ecclesia%20%28ancient%20Athens%29">ecclesia</a> (the Athenian Assembly) and told them that the Assembly was haughty and had great ambitions. He urged them to renounce their diplomatic authority to represent Sparta, and instead allow him to assist them through his influence in Athenian politics. The representatives agreed and, impressed with Alcibiades, they alienated themselves from Nicias, who genuinely wanted to reach an agreement with the Spartans. The next day, during the Assembly, Alcibiades asked them what powers Sparta had granted them to negotiate and they replied, as agreed, that they had not come with full and independent powers. This was in direct contradiction to what they had said the day before, and Alcibiades seized on this opportunity to denounce their character, cast suspicion on their aims, and destroy their credibility. This ploy increased Alcibiades's standing while embarrassing Nicias, and Alcibiades was subsequently appointed General. He took advantage of his increasing power to orchestrate the creation of an alliance between <a href="Argos">Argos</a>, <a href="Mantinea">Mantinea</a>, <a href="Elis">Elis</a>, and other states in the Peloponnese, threatening Sparta's dominance in the region. According to Gomme, "it was a grandiose scheme for an Athenian general at the head of a mainly Peloponnesian army to march through the Peloponnese cocking a snook at Sparta when her reputation was at its lowest". This alliance, however, would ultimately be defeated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mantinea%20%28418%20BC%29">Battle of Mantinea</a>.

Somewhere in the years 416–415 BC, a complex struggle took place between <a href="Hyperbolos">Hyperbolos</a> on one side and Nicias and Alcibiades on the other. Hyperbolos tried to bring about the <a href="ostracism">ostracism</a> of one of this pair, but Nicias and Alcibiades combined their influence to induce the people to expel Hyperbolos instead. This incident reveals that Nicias and Alcibiades each commanded a personal following, whose votes were determined by the wishes of the leaders.

Alcibiades was not one of the Generals involved in <a href="Melian%20dialogue">the capture of Melos</a> in 416–415 BC, but Plutarch describes him as a supporter of the decree by which the grown men of Melos were killed and the women and children enslaved. An oration urging Alcibiades' ostracism, "Against Alcibiades" (historically attributed to the orator <a href="Andocides">Andocides</a> but not in fact by him), alleges that Alcibiades had a child by one of these enslaved women.

In 415 BC, delegates from the Sicilian city of <a href="Segesta">Segesta</a> () arrived at Athens to plead for the support of the Athenians in their war against <a href="Selinus">Selinus</a>. During the debates on the undertaking, Nicias was vehemently opposed to Athenian intervention, explaining that the campaign would be very costly and attacking the character and motives of Alcibiades, who had emerged as a major supporter of the expedition. On the other hand, Alcibiades argued that a campaign in this new theatre would bring riches to the city and expand the empire, just as the <a href="Persian%20Wars">Persian Wars</a> had. In his speech Alcibiades predicted (over-optimistically, in the opinion of most historians) that the Athenians would be able to recruit allies in the region and impose their rule on <a href="Syracuse%2C%20Sicily">Syracuse</a>, the most powerful city of <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>. In spite of Alcibiades's enthusiastic advocacy for the plan, it was Nicias, not he, who turned a modest undertaking into a massive campaign and made the conquest of Sicily seem possible and safe. It was at his suggestion that the size of the fleet was significantly increased from 60 ships to "140 galleys, 5,100 men at arms, and about 1300 archers, slingers, and light armed men". Philosopher <a href="Leo%20Strauss">Leo Strauss</a> underscores that the Sicilian expedition surpassed everything undertaken by Pericles. Almost certainly Nicias's intention was to shock the assembly with his high estimate of the forces required, but, instead of dissuading his fellow citizens, his analysis made them all the more eager. Against his wishes Nicias was appointed General along with Alcibiades and <a href="Lamachus">Lamachus</a>, all three of whom were given full powers to do whatever was in the best interests of Athens while in Sicily.

One night during preparations for the expedition, the <a href="herma">herma</a>i, heads of the god <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a> on a <a href="plinth">plinth</a> with a <a href="phallus">phallus</a>, were mutilated throughout Athens. This was a religious scandal and was seen as a bad omen for the mission. Plutarch explains that Androcles, a political leader, used false witnesses who accused Alcibiades and his friends of mutilating the statues, and of profaning the <a href="Eleusinian%20Mysteries">Eleusinian Mysteries</a>. Later his opponents, chief among them being Androcles and Thessalus, <a href="Cimon">Cimon</a>'s son, enlisted orators to argue that Alcibiades should set sail as planned and stand trial on his return from the campaign. Alcibiades was suspicious of their intentions, and asked to be allowed to stand trial immediately, under penalty of death, in order to clear his name. This request was denied, and the fleet set sail soon after, with the charges unresolved.

As Alcibiades had suspected, his absence emboldened his enemies, and they began to accuse him of other sacrilegious actions and comments and even alleged that these actions were connected with a plot against the democracy. According to <a href="Thucydides">Thucydides</a>, the Athenians were always in fear and took everything suspiciously. When the fleet arrived in <a href="Catania">Catania</a>, it found the state <a href="trireme">trireme</a> "Salaminia" waiting to bring Alcibiades and the others indicted for mutilating the hermai or profaning the Eleusinian Mysteries back to Athens to stand trial. Alcibiades told the heralds that he would follow them back to Athens in his ship, but in <a href="Thurii">Thurii</a> he escaped with his crew; in Athens he was <a href="trial%20in%20absentia">convicted "in absentia"</a> and condemned to death. His property was confiscated and a reward of one <a href="talent%20%28weight%29">talent</a> was promised to whoever succeeded in killing any who had fled. Meanwhile, the Athenian force in Sicily, after a few early victories, moved against <a href="Messina">Messina</a>, where the Generals expected their secret allies within the city to betray it to them. Alcibiades, however, foreseeing that he would be outlawed, gave information to the friends of the Syracusans in Messina, who succeeded in preventing the admission of the Athenians. With the death of Lamachus in battle some time later, command of the Sicilian Expedition fell into the hands of Nicias, whom modern scholars have judged to be an inadequate military leader.

After his disappearance at Thurii, Alcibiades quickly contacted the Spartans, "promising to render them aid and service greater than all the harm he had previously done them as an enemy" if they would offer him sanctuary. The Spartans granted this request and received him among them. Because of this defection, the Athenians condemned him to death "in absentia" and confiscated his property. In the debate at Sparta over whether to send a force to relieve Syracuse, Alcibiades spoke and instilled fear of Athenian ambition into the Spartan ephors by informing them that the Athenians hoped to conquer Sicily, <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, and even <a href="Carthage">Carthage</a>. <a href="Yale%20University">Yale</a> historian <a href="Donald%20Kagan">Donald Kagan</a> believes that Alcibiades knowingly exaggerated the plans of the Athenians to convince the Spartans of the benefit they stood to gain from his help. Kagan asserts that Alcibiades had not yet acquired his "legendary" reputation, and the Spartans saw him as "a defeated and hunted man" whose policies "produced strategic failures" and brought "no decisive result". If accurate, this assessment underscores one of Alcibiades's greatest talents, his highly persuasive oratory. After making the threat seem imminent, Alcibiades advised the Spartans to send troops and most importantly, a Spartan commander to discipline and aid the Syracusans.

Alcibiades served as a military adviser to Sparta and helped the Spartans secure several crucial successes. He advised them to build a permanent fort at <a href="Decelea">Decelea</a>, just over ten miles (16 km) from Athens and within sight of the city. By doing this, the Spartans cut the Athenians off entirely from their homes and crops and the silver mines of <a href="Sunium">Sunium</a>. This was part of Alcibiades's plan to renew the war with Athens in <a href="Attica">Attica</a>. The move was devastating to Athens and forced the citizens to live within the <a href="Long%20Walls">long walls</a> of the city year round, making them entirely dependent on their seaborne trade for food. Seeing Athens thus beleaguered on a second front, members of the <a href="Delian%20League">Delian League</a> began to contemplate revolt. In the wake of Athens's disastrous defeat in Sicily, Alcibiades sailed to <a href="Ionia">Ionia</a> with a Spartan fleet and succeeded in persuading several critical cities to revolt.

In spite of these valuable contributions to the Spartan cause, Alcibiades fell out of favor with the Spartan government at around this time, ruled by <a href="Agis%20II">Agis II</a>. <a href="Leotychides%2C%20son%20of%20Agis">Leotychides</a>, the son born by Agis's wife <a href="Timaia">Timaia</a> shortly after this, was believed by many to be Alcibiades's son. An alternate account asserts that Alcibiades took advantage of King Agis' absence with the Spartan Army in <a href="Attica">Attica</a> and seduced his wife, <a href="Timonassa">Timonassa</a>.

Alcibiades's influence was further reduced after the retirement of <a href="Endius">Endius</a>, the <a href="ephor">ephor</a> who was on good terms with him. It is alleged that <a href="Astyochus">Astyochus</a>, a Spartan Admiral, was sent orders to kill him, but Alcibiades received warning of this order and defected to the Persian <a href="satrap">satrap</a> <a href="Tissaphernes">Tissaphernes</a>, who had been supporting the Peloponnesian forces financially in 412 BC.

On his arrival in the local Persian court, Alcibiades won the trust of the powerful <a href="satrap">satrap</a> and made several policy suggestions which were well received. According to <a href="Thucydides">Thucydides</a>, Alcibiades immediately began to do all he could with Tissaphernes to injure the Peloponnesian cause. At his urging, the satrap reduced the payments he was making to the Peloponnesian fleet and began delivering them irregularly. Alcibiades next advised Tissaphernes to bribe the Generals of the cities to gain valuable intelligence on their activities. Lastly, and most importantly, he told the satrap to be in no hurry to bring the Persian fleet into the conflict, as the longer the war dragged out the more exhausted the combatants would become. This would allow the Persians to more easily conquer the region in the aftermath of the fighting. Alcibiades tried to convince the satrap that it was in Persia's interest to wear both Athens and Sparta out at first, "and after docking the Athenian power as much as he could, forthwith to rid the country of the Peloponnesians". Although Alcibiades's advice benefited the Persians, it was merely a means to an end; Thucydides tells us that his real motive was to use his alleged influence with the Persians to effect his restoration to Athens. Alcibiades was one of the several Greeks aristocrats who took refuge in the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a> following reversals at home, other famous ones being <a href="Themistocles">Themistocles</a>, <a href="Demaratos">Demaratos</a> or <a href="Gongylos">Gongylos</a>. According to <a href="Thucydides">Thucydides</a> (Thuc.8.47), Alcibiades also advised the Achaemenid king (<a href="Darius%20II">Darius II</a>), and therefore he may also have traveled to <a href="Susa">Susa</a> or <a href="Babylonia">Babylonia</a> to encounter him.

Alcibiades seemed to assume that the "radical democracy" would never agree to his recall to Athens. Therefore, he exchanged messages with the Athenian leaders at <a href="Samos">Samos</a> and suggested that if they could install an <a href="oligarchy">oligarchy</a> friendly to him he would return to Athens and bring with him Persian money and possibly the Persian fleet of 147 triremes. Alcibiades set about winning over the most influential military officers, and achieved his goal by offering them a threefold plan: the Athenian constitution was to be changed, the recall of Alcibiades was to be voted, and Alcibiades was to win over Tissaphernes and the King of Persia to the Athenian side. Most of the officers in the Athenian fleet accepted the plan and welcomed the prospect of a narrower constitution, which would allow them a greater share in determining policy. According to Thucydides, only one of the Athenian Generals at Samos, <a href="The%20Four%20Hundred%20%28oligarchy%29">Phrynichus</a>, opposed the plan and argued that Alcibiades cared no more for the proposed oligarchy than for the traditional democracy. The involvement in the plot of another General, <a href="Thrasybulus">Thrasybulus</a>, remains unclear.

These officers of the Athenian fleet formed a group of conspirators, but were met with opposition from the majority of the soldiers and sailors; these were eventually calmed down "by the advantageous prospect of the pay from the king". The members of the group assembled and prepared to send <a href="Pisander">Pisander</a>, one of their number, on an embassy to Athens to treat for the restoration of Alcibiades and the abolition of the democracy in the city, and thus to make Tissaphernes the friend of the Athenians.

Phrynichus, fearing that Alcibiades if restored would avenge himself upon him for his opposition, sent a secret letter to the Spartan Admiral, Astyochus, to tell him that Alcibiades was ruining their cause by making Tissaphernes the friend of the Athenians, and containing an express revelation of the rest of the intrigue. Astyochus went up to Alcibiades and Tissaphernes at <a href="Magnesia%20on%20the%20Maeander">Magnesia</a> and communicated to them Phrynichus's letter. Alcibiades responded in kind, sending to the authorities at Samos a letter against Phrynichus, stating what he had done, and requiring that he should be put to death. Phrynichus in desperation wrote again to Astyochus, offering him a chance to destroy the Athenian fleet at Samos. This also Astyochus revealed to Alcibiades who informed the officers at Samos that they had been betrayed by Phrynichus. Alcibiades however gained no credit, because Phrynichus had anticipated Alcibiades's letter and, before the accusations could arrive, told the army that he had received information of an enemy plan to attack the camp and that they should fortify Samos as quickly as possible.

Despite these events, Pisander and the other envoys of the conspirators arrived at Athens and made a speech before the people. Pisander won the argument, putting Alcibiades and his promises at the center. The Ecclesia deposed Phrynichus and elected Pisander and ten other envoys to negotiate with Tissaphernes and Alcibiades.

At this point, Alcibiades's scheme encountered a great obstacle. Tissaphernes would not make an agreement on any terms, wanting to follow his policy of neutrality. As Kagan points out, Tissaphernes was a prudent leader and had recognized the advantages of wearing each side out without direct Persian involvement. Alcibiades realized this and, by presenting the Athenians with stiffer and stiffer demands on Tissaphernes's behalf, attempted to convince them that he had persuaded Tissaphernes to support them, but that they had not conceded enough to him. Although the envoys were angered at the audacity of the Persian demands, they nevertheless departed with the impression that Alcibiades could have brought about an agreement among the powers if he had chosen to do so. This <a href="wikt%3Afiasco">fiasco</a> at the court of Tissaphernes, however, put an end to the negotiations between the conspirators and Alcibiades. The group was convinced that Alcibiades could not deliver his side of the bargain without demanding exorbitantly high concessions of them and they accordingly abandoned their plans to restore him to Athens.

In spite of the failure of the negotiations, the conspirators succeeded in overthrowing the democracy and imposing the oligarchic government of the <a href="The%20Four%20Hundred%20%28oligarchy%29">Four Hundred</a>, among the leaders of which were Phrynichus and Pisander. At Samos, however, a similar coup instigated by the conspirators did not go forward so smoothly. Samian democrats learned of the conspiracy and notified four prominent Athenians: the generals Leon and Diomedon, the <a href="trierarch">trierarch</a> Thrasybulus, and Thrasyllus, at that time a <a href="hoplite">hoplite</a> in the ranks. With the support of these men and the Athenian soldiers in general, the Samian democrats were able to defeat the 300 Samian oligarchs who attempted to seize power there. Further, the Athenian troops at Samos formed themselves into a political assembly, deposed their generals, and elected new ones, including Thrasybulus and Thrasyllus. The army, stating that they had not revolted from the city but that the city had revolted from them, resolved to stand by the democracy while continuing to prosecute the war against Sparta.

After a time, Thrasybulus persuaded the assembled troops to vote Alcibiades's recall, a policy that he had supported since before the coup. Then he sailed to retrieve Alcibiades and returned with him to Samos. The aim of this policy was to win away Persian support from the Spartans, as it was still believed that Alcibiades had great influence with Tissaphernes. Plutarch claims that the army sent for Alcibiades so as to use his help in putting down the tyrants in Athens. Kagan argues that this reinstatement was a disappointment to Alcibiades, who had hoped for a glorious return to Athens itself but found himself only restored to the rebellious fleet, where the immunity from prosecution he had been granted "protected him for the time being but not from a reckoning in the future"; furthermore, the recall, which Alcibiades had hoped to bring about through his own prestige and perceived influence, was achieved through the patronage of Thrasybulus.

At his first speech to the assembled troops, Alcibiades complained bitterly about the circumstances of his exile, but the greatest part of the speech consisted of boasting about his influence with Tissaphernes. The primary motives of his speech were to make the oligarchs at Athens afraid of him and to increase his credit with the army at Samos. Upon hearing his speech the troops immediately elected him General alongside Thrasybulus and the others. In fact, he roused them so much that they proposed to sail at once for <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a> and attack the oligarchs in Athens. It was primarily Alcibiades, along with Thrasybulus, who calmed the people and showed them the folly of this proposal, which would have sparked civil war and led to the immediate defeat of Athens. Shortly after Alcibiades's reinstatement as an Athenian general, the government of the Four Hundred was overthrown and replaced by a broader oligarchy, which would eventually give way to democracy.

Presently Alcibiades sailed to Tissaphernes with a detachment of ships. According to Plutarch, the supposed purpose of this mission was to stop the Persian fleet from coming to the aid of the Peloponnesians. Thucydides is in agreement with Plutarch that the Persian fleet was at <a href="Aspendus">Aspendus</a> and that Alcibiades told the troops he would bring the fleet to their side or prevent it from coming at all, but Thucydides further speculates that the real reason was to flaunt his new position to Tissaphernes and try to gain some real influence over him. According to the historian, Alcibiades had long known that Tissaphernes never meant to bring the fleet at all.

Alcibiades was recalled by the "intermediate regime" of The Five Thousand, the government which succeeded the Four Hundred in 411, but it is most likely that he waited until 407 BC to actually return to the city. Plutarch tells us that, although his recall had already been passed on motion of <a href="Critias">Critias</a>, a political ally of his, Alcibiades was resolved to come back with glory. While this was certainly his goal, it was again a means to an end, that end being avoiding prosecution upon his return to Athens.

The next significant part he would play in the war would occur at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Abydos">Battle of Abydos</a>. Alcibiades had remained behind at Samos with a small force while Thrasybulus and Thrasyllus led the greater part of the fleet to the <a href="Hellespont">Hellespont</a>. During this period, Alcibiades succeeded in raising money from <a href="Caria">Caria</a> and the neighboring area, with which he was able to pay the rowers and gain their favor. After the Athenian victory at <a href="Battle%20of%20Cynossema">Cynossema</a>, both fleets summoned all their ships from around the Aegean to join them for what might be a decisive next engagement.
While Alcibiades was still en route, the two fleets clashed at <a href="Abydos%2C%20Hellespont">Abydos</a>, where the Peloponnesians had set up their main naval base. The battle was evenly matched, and raged for a long time, but the balance tipped towards the Athenians when Alcibiades sailed into the Hellespont with eighteen triremes. The Persian satrap <a href="Pharnabazus%20%285th%20century%20BC%29">Pharnabazus</a>, who had replaced Tissaphernes as the sponsor of the Peloponnesian fleet, moved his land army to the shore to defend the ships and sailors who had beached their ships. Only the support of the Persian land army and the coming of night saved the Peloponnesian fleet from complete destruction.

Shortly after the battle, Tissaphernes had arrived in the Hellespont and Alcibiades left the fleet at Sestos to meet him, bringing gifts and hoping to once again try to win over the Persian governor. Evidently Alcibiades had gravely misjudged his standing with the satrap, and he was arrested on arrival. Within a month he would escape and resume command. It was now obvious, however, that he had no influence with the Persians; from now on his authority would depend on what he actually could accomplish rather than on what he promised to do.

After an interlude of several months in which the Peloponnesians constructed new ships and the Athenians besieged cities and raised money throughout the Aegean, the next major sea battle took place the spring of 410 BC at <a href="Cyzicus">Cyzicus</a>. Alcibiades had been forced to flee from <a href="Sestos">Sestos</a> to <a href="Cardia">Cardia</a> to protect his small fleet from the rebuilt Peloponnesian navy, but as soon as the Athenian fleet was reunited there its commanders led it to Cyzicus, where the Athenians had intelligence indicating that Pharnabazus and <a href="Mindarus">Mindarus</a>, the Peloponnesian fleet commander, were together plotting their next move. Concealed by storm and darkness, the combined Athenian force reached the vicinity without being spotted by the Peloponnesians. Here the Athenians devised a plot to draw the enemy into battle. According to <a href="Diodorus%20Siculus">Diodorus Siculus</a>, Alcibiades advanced with a small squadron in order to draw the Spartans out to battle, and, after he successfully deceived Mindarus with this ploy, the squadrons of Thrasybulus and Theramenes came to join him, cutting off the Spartans' retreat.

The Spartan fleet suffered losses in the flight and reached the shore with the Athenians in close pursuit. Alcibiades's troops, leading the Athenian pursuit, landed and attempted to pull the Spartan ships back out to sea. The Peloponnesians fought to prevent their ships from being towed away, and Pharnabazus's troops came up to support them. Thrasybulus landed his own force to temporarily relieve pressure on Alcibiades, and meanwhile ordered <a href="Theramenes">Theramenes</a> to join up with Athenian land forces nearby and bring them to reinforce the sailors and marines on the beach. The Spartans and Persians, overwhelmed by the arrival of multiple forces from several directions, were defeated and driven off, and the Athenians captured all the Spartan ships which were not destroyed. A letter dispatched to Sparta by Hippocrates, vice-admiral under Mindarus, was intercepted and taken to Athens; it ran as follows: "The ships are lost. Mindarus is dead. The men are starving. We know not what to do". A short time later Sparta petitioned for peace, but their appeals were ultimately rejected by the Athenians.

After their victory, Alcibiades and Thrasybulus began the siege of <a href="Chalcedon">Chalcedon</a> in 409 BC with about 190 ships. Although unable to attain a decisive victory or induce the city to surrender, Alcibiades was able to win a small tactical land battle outside of the city gates and Theramenes concluded an agreement with the Chalcedonians. Afterwards they concluded a temporary alliance with Pharnabazus which secured some much needed immediate cash for the army, but despite this Alcibiades was still forced to depart in search for more booty to pay the soldiers and oarsmen of the fleet.

In pursuit of these funds he traveled to the <a href="Thracian%20Chersonese">Thracian Chersonese</a> and attacked <a href="Selymbria">Selymbria</a>. He plotted with a pro-Athenian party within the city and offered the Selymbrians reasonable terms and imposed strict discipline to see that they were observed. He did their city no injury whatsoever, but merely took a sum of money from it, set a garrison in it and left. Epigraphical evidence indicates the Selymbrians surrendered hostages until the treaty was ratified in Athens. His performance is judged as skillful by historians, since it saved time, resources, and lives and still fully achieved his goal.

From here Alcibiades joined in the siege of <a href="Byzantium">Byzantium</a> along with Theramenes and Thrasyllus. A portion of the citizens of the city, demoralized and hungry, decided to surrender the city to Alcibiades for similar terms as the Selymbrians had received. On the designated night the defenders left their posts, and the Athenians attacked the Peloponnesian garrison in the city and their boats in the harbor. The portion of the citizenry that remained loyal to the Peloponnesians fought so savagely that Alcibiades issued a statement in the midst of the fighting which guaranteed their safety and this persuaded the remaining citizens to turn against the Peloponnesian garrison, which was nearly totally destroyed.

It was in the aftermath of these successes that Alcibiades resolved to finally return to Athens in the spring of 407 BC. Even in the wake of his recent victories, Alcibiades was exceedingly careful in his return, mindful of the changes in government, the charges still technically hanging over him, and the great injury he had done to Athens. Thus Alcibiades, instead of going straight home, first went to Samos to pick up 20 ships and proceeded with them to the <a href="Ceramic%20Gulf">Ceramic Gulf</a> where he collected 100 talents. He finally sailed to <a href="Gytheion">Gytheion</a> to make inquiries, partly about the reported preparations of the Spartans there, and partly about the feelings in Athens about his return. His inquiries assured him that the city was kindly disposed towards him and that his closest friends urged him to return.

Therefore, he finally sailed into Piraeus where the crowd had gathered, desiring to see the famous Alcibiades. He entered the harbor full of fear till he saw his cousin and others of his friends and acquaintance, who invited him to land. Upon arriving on shore he was greeted with a hero's welcome. Nevertheless, some saw an evil <a href="omen">omen</a> in the fact that he had returned to Athens on the very day when the ceremony of the <a href="Plynteria">Plynteria</a> (the feast where the old statue of <a href="Athena">Athena</a> would get cleansed) was being celebrated. This was regarded as the unluckiest day of the year to undertake anything of importance. His enemies took note of this and kept it in mind for a future occasion.

All the criminal proceedings against him were canceled and the charges of <a href="blasphemy">blasphemy</a> were officially withdrawn. Alcibiades was able to assert his piety and to raise Athenian morale by leading the solemn procession to <a href="Eleusis">Eleusis</a> (for the celebration of the Eleusinian Mysteries) by land for the first time since the Spartans had occupied Decelea. The procession had been replaced by a journey by sea, but this year Alcibiades used a detachment of soldiers to escort the traditional procession. His property was restored and the ecclesia elected him supreme commander of land and sea (<a href="Autokrator">strategos autokrator</a>).

In 406 BC Alcibiades set out from Athens with 1,500 hoplites and a hundred ships. He failed to take <a href="Andros">Andros</a> and then he went on to Samos. Later he moved to <a href="Notium">Notium</a>, closer to the enemy at <a href="Ephesus">Ephesus</a>. In the meanwhile Tissaphernes had been replaced by <a href="Cyrus%20the%20Younger">Cyrus the Younger</a> (son of <a href="Darius%20II%20of%20Persia">Darius II of Persia</a>) who decided to financially support the Peloponnesians. This new revenue started to attract Athenian deserters to the Spartan navy. Additionally the Spartans had replaced Mindarus with <a href="Lysander">Lysander</a>, a very capable admiral. These factors caused the rapid growth of the Peloponnesian fleet at the expense of the Athenian. In search of funds and needing to force another decisive battle, Alcibiades left Notium and sailed to help <a href="Thrasybulus">Thrasybulus</a> in the siege of <a href="Phocaea">Phocaea</a>. Alcibiades was aware the Spartan fleet was nearby, so he left nearly eighty ships to watch them under the command of his personal helmsman <a href="Antiochus%20%28admiral%29">Antiochus</a>, who was given express orders not to attack. Antiochus disobeyed this single order and endeavored to draw Lysander into a fight by imitating the tactics used at Cyzicus. The situation at Notium, however, was radically different from that at Cyzicus; the Athenians possessed no element of surprise, and Lysander had been well informed about their fleet by deserters. Antiochus's ship was sunk, and he was killed by a sudden Spartan attack; the remaining ships of the decoy force were then chased headlong back toward Notium, where the main Athenian force was caught unprepared by the sudden arrival of the whole Spartan fleet. In the ensuing fighting, Lysander gained an entire victory. Alcibiades soon returned and desperately tried to undo the defeat at Notium by scoring another victory, but Lysander could not be compelled to attack the fleet again.

Responsibility for the defeat ultimately fell on Alcibiades, and his enemies used the opportunity to attack him and have him removed from command, although some modern scholars believe that Alcibiades was unfairly blamed for <a href="Antiochus%20%28admiral%29">Antiochus</a>'s mistake. <a href="Diodorus">Diodorus</a> reports that, in addition to his mistake at Notium, Alcibiades was discharged on account of false accusations brought against him by his enemies. According to Anthony Andrewes, professor of <a href="ancient%20history">ancient history</a>, the extravagant hopes that his successes of the previous summer had created were a decisive element in his downfall. Consequently, Alcibiades condemned himself to exile. Never again returning to Athens, he sailed north to the castles in the Thracian Chersonese, which he had secured during his time in the Hellespont. The implications of the defeat were severe for Athens. Although the defeat had been minor, it occasioned the removal of not only Alcibiades but also his allies like <a href="Thrasybulus">Thrasybulus</a>, <a href="Theramenes">Theramenes</a> and <a href="Critias">Critias</a>. These were likely the most capable commanders Athens had at the time, and their removal would help lead to the Athenian surrender only two years later, after their complete defeat at <a href="Aegospotami">Aegospotami</a>.

With one exception, Alcibiades's role in the war ended with his command. Prior to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Aegospotami">Battle of Aegospotami</a>, in the last attested fact of his career, Alcibiades recognized that the Athenians were anchored in a tactically disadvantageous spot and advised them to move to <a href="Sestus">Sestus</a> where they could benefit from a harbor and a city. Diodorus, however, does not mention this advice, arguing instead that Alcibiades offered the Generals Thracian aid in exchange for a share in the command. In any case, the Generals of the Athenians, "considering that in case of defeat the blame would attach to them and that in case of success all men would attribute it to Alcibiades", asked him to leave and not come near the camp ever again. Days later the fleet would be annihilated by Lysander.

After the Battle of Aegospotami, Alcibiades crossed the Hellespont and took refuge in <a href="Hellespontine%20Phrygia">Hellespontine Phrygia</a>, with the object of securing the aid of the <a href="Achaemenid">Achaemenid</a> King <a href="Artaxerxes%20II%20of%20Persia">Artaxerxes</a> against Sparta. Alcibiades was one of the several Greeks aristocrats who took refuge in the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a> following reversals at home, other famous ones being <a href="Themistocles">Themistocles</a>, <a href="Hippias%20%28tyrant%29">Hippias</a>, <a href="Demaratos">Demaratos</a> or <a href="Gongylos">Gongylos</a>. In general, those were generously welcomed by the Achaemenid kings, and received land grants to support them, and ruled on various cities of <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>.

Much about Alcibiades's death is now uncertain, as there are conflicting accounts. According to the oldest of these, the Spartans and specifically Lysander were responsible. Though many of his details cannot be independently corroborated, Plutarch's version is this: Lysander sent an envoy to <a href="Pharnabazus%20%285th%20century%20BC%29">Pharnabazus</a> who then dispatched his brother to Phrygia where Alcibiades was living with his mistress, Timandra.

In 404 BC, as he was about to set out for the Persian court, his residence was surrounded and set on fire. Seeing no chance of escape he rushed out on his assassins, dagger in hand, and was killed by a shower of arrows. According to <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, the site of Alcibiades's death was Elaphus, a mountain in Phrygia.

In <a href="ancient%20Greece">ancient Greece</a>, Alcibiades was a polarizing figure. According to Thucydides, Alcibiades, being "exceedingly ambitious", proposed the expedition in Sicily in order "to gain in wealth and reputation by means of his successes". Alcibiades is not held responsible by Thucydides for the destruction of Athens, since "his habits gave offence to every one, and caused the Athenians to commit affairs to other hands, and thus before long to ruin the city". Plutarch regards him as "the least scrupulous and most entirely careless of human beings". On the other hand, <a href="Diodorus%20Siculus">Diodorus</a> argues that he was "in spirit brilliant and intent upon great enterprises". Sharon Press of <a href="Brown%20University">Brown University</a> points out that <a href="Xenophon">Xenophon</a> emphasizes Alcibiades's service to the state, rather than the harm he was charged with causing it. <a href="Demosthenes">Demosthenes</a> defends Alcibiades's achievements, saying that he had taken arms in the cause of democracy, displaying his patriotism, not by gifts of money or by speeches, but by personal service. For Demosthenes and other orators, Alcibiades epitomized the figure of the great man during the glorious days of the <a href="Athenian%20democracy">Athenian democracy</a> and became a rhetorical symbol. One of <a href="Isocrates">Isocrates</a>' speeches, delivered by Alcibiades the Younger, argues that the statesman deserved the Athenians' gratitude for the service he had given them. <a href="Lysias">Lysias</a>, on the other hand, argued in one of his orations that the Athenians should regard Alcibiades as an enemy because of the general tenor of his life, as "he repays with injury the open assistance of any of his friends". In the "<a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20Athenians%20%28Aristotle%29">Constitution of the Athenians</a>", <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> does not include Alcibiades in the list of the best Athenian politicians, but in "<a href="Posterior%20Analytics">Posterior Analytics</a>" he argues that traits of a proud man like Alcibiades are "equanimity amid the vicissitudes of life and impatience of dishonor". Alcibiades excited in his contemporaries a fear for the safety of the political order. Therefore, <a href="Andocides">Andocides</a> said of him that "instead of holding that he ought himself to conform with the laws of the state, he expects you to conform with his own way of life". Central to the depiction of the Athenian statesman is <a href="Cornelius%20Nepos">Cornelius Nepos</a>' famous phrase that Alcibiades "surpassed all the Athenians in grandeur and magnificence of living".

Even today, Alcibiades divides scholars. For Malcolm F. McGregor, former head of the Department of Classics in the <a href="University%20of%20British%20Columbia">University of British Columbia</a>, Alcibiades was rather a shrewd gambler than a mere opportunist. Evangelos P. Fotiadis, a prominent Greek <a href="philology">philologist</a>, asserts that Alcibiades was "a first class diplomat" and had "huge skills". Nevertheless, his spiritual powers were not counterbalanced with his magnificent mind and he had the hard luck to lead a people susceptible to demagoguery. <a href="Constantine%20Paparregopoulus">K. Paparrigopoulos</a>, a major modern Greek historian, underlines his "spiritual virtues" and compares him with <a href="Themistocles">Themistocles</a>, but he then asserts that all these gifts created a "traitor, an audacious and impious man". Walter Ellis believes that his actions were outrageous, but they were performed with <a href="panache">panache</a>. For his part, David Gribble argues that Alcibiades's actions against his city were misunderstood and believes that "the tension which led to Alcibiades's split with the city was between purely personal and civic values". <a href="Russell%20Meiggs">Russell Meiggs</a>, a British ancient historian, asserts that the Athenian statesman was absolutely unscrupulous despite his great charm and brilliant abilities. According to Meiggs his actions were dictated by selfish motives and his feud with <a href="Cleon">Cleon</a> and his successors undermined Athens. The same scholar underscores the fact that "his example of restless and undisciplined ambition strengthened the charge brought against Socrates". Even more critically, Athanasios G. Platias and Constantinos Koliopoulos, professors of strategic studies and <a href="international%20politics">international politics</a>, state that Alcibiades's own arguments "should be sufficient to do away with the notion that Alcibiades was a great statesman, as some people still believe". Writing from a different perspective, psychologist Anna C. Salter cites Alcibiades as exhibiting "all the classic features of <a href="psychopathy">psychopathy</a>." A similar assessment is made by <a href="Hervey%20Cleckley">Hervey Cleckley</a> at the end of chapter 5 in his "<a href="The%20Mask%20of%20Sanity">The Mask of Sanity</a>".

Despite his critical comments, Thucydides admits in a short digression that "publicly his conduct of the war was as good as could be desired". Diodorus and Demosthenes regard him as a great general. According to Fotiadis, Alcibiades was an invincible general and, wherever he went, victory followed him; had he led the army in Sicily, the Athenians would have avoided disaster and, had his countrymen followed his advice at Aegospotami, Lysander would have lost and Athens would have ruled Greece. On the other hand, Paparrigopoulos believes that the Sicilian Expedition, prompted by Alcibiades, was a strategic mistake. In agreement with Paparrigopoulos, Platias and Koliopoulos underscore the fact that the Sicilian expedition was a strategic blunder of the first magnitude, resulting from a "frivolous attitude and an unbelievable underestimation of the enemy". For his part, Angelos Vlachos, a Greek <a href="Academician">Academician</a>, underlines the constant interest of Athens for Sicily from the beginning of the war. According to Vlachos, the expedition had nothing of the extravagant or adventurous and constituted a rational strategic decision based on traditional Athenian aspirations. Vlachos asserts that Alcibiades had already conceived a broader plan: the conquest of the whole West. He intended to conquer Carthage and <a href="Libya">Libya</a>, then to attack <a href="Italy">Italy</a> and, after winning these, to seize Italy and Peloponnesus. The initial decision of the ecclesia provided however for a reasonable military force, which later became unreasonably large and costly because of Nicias's demands. Kagan criticizes Alcibiades for failing to recognize that the large size of the Athenian expedition undermined the diplomatic scheme on which his strategy rested.

Kagan believes that while Alcibiades was a commander of considerable ability, he was no military genius, and his confidence and ambitions went far beyond his skills. He thus was capable of important errors and serious miscalculations. Kagan argues that at Notium, Alcibiades committed a serious error in leaving the fleet in the hands of an inexperienced officer, and that most of the credit for the brilliant victory at Cyzicus must be assigned to Thrasybulus. In this judgement, Kagan agrees with Cornelius Nepos, who said that the Athenians' extravagant opinion of Alcibiades's abilities and valor was his chief misfortune.

Press argues that "though Alcibiades can be considered a good General on the basis of his performance in the Hellespont, he would not be considered so on the basis of his performance in Sicily", but "the strengths of Alcibiades's performance as a General outweigh his faults".

Plutarch asserts that "Alcibiades was a most able speaker in addition to his other gifts", while <a href="Theophrastus">Theophrastus</a> argues that Alcibiades was the most capable of discovering and understanding what was required in a given case. Nevertheless, he would often stumble in the midst of his speech, but then he would resume and proceed with all the caution in the world. Even the <a href="lisp">lisp</a> he had, which was noticed by Aristophanes, made his talk persuasive and full of charm. Eupolis says that he was "prince of talkers, but in speaking most incapable"; which is to say, more eloquent in his private discourses than when orating before the ecclesia. For his part, Demosthenes underscores the fact that Alcibiades was regarded as "the ablest speaker of the day". Paparrigopoulos does not accept Demosthenes's opinion, but acknowledges that the Athenian statesman could sufficiently support his case. Kagan acknowledges his rhetorical power, whilst <a href="Thomas%20Habinek">Thomas Habinek</a>, professor of Classics at the <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California">University of Southern California</a>, believes that the orator Alcibiades seemed to be whatever his audience needed on any given occasion. According to Habinek, in the field of oratory, the people responded to Alcibiades's affection with affection of their own. Therefore, the orator was "the institution of the city talking to—and loving—itself". According to Aristophanes, Athens "yearns for him, and hates him too, but wants him back".

Alcibiades has not been spared by ancient comedy and stories attest to an epic confrontation between Alcibiades and <a href="Eupolis">Eupolis</a> resembling that between Aristophanes and <a href="Cleon">Cleon</a>. He also appears as a character in several <a href="Socratic%20dialogue">Socratic dialogue</a>s ("<a href="Symposium%20%28Plato%29">Symposium</a>", "<a href="Protagoras%20%28dialogue%29">Protagoras</a>", "<a href="First%20Alcibiades">Alcibiades I</a>" and "<a href="Second%20Alcibiades">II</a>", as well as the eponymous dialogues by <a href="Aeschines%20Socraticus">Aeschines Socraticus</a> and <a href="Antisthenes">Antisthenes</a>). Purportedly based on his own personal experience, Antisthenes described Alcibiades's extraordinary physical strength, courage, and beauty, saying, "If <a href="Achilles">Achilles</a> did not look like this, he was not really handsome." In his <a href="trial%20of%20Socrates">trial</a>, Socrates must rebut the attempt to hold him guilty for the crimes of his former students, including Alcibiades. Hence, he declares in "<a href="Apology%20%28Plato%29">Apology</a>": "I have never been anyone's teacher".

Long after his death, Alcibiades continues to appear in art, both in Medieval and <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> works, and in several significant works of modern literature as well. He still fascinates the modern world, doing so most notably as the main character in <a href="historical%20novel">historical novel</a>s of authors like <a href="Anna%20Bowman%20Dodd">Anna Bowman Dodd</a>, <a href="Gertrude%20Atherton">Gertrude Atherton</a>, <a href="Rosemary%20Sutcliff">Rosemary Sutcliff</a>, <a href="Daniel%20Chavarria">Daniel Chavarria</a>, <a href="Steven%20Pressfield">Steven Pressfield</a> and <a href="Peter%20Green%20%28historian%29">Peter Green</a>.

He appears repeatedly in the 2018 video game <a href="Assassin%27s%20Creed%20Odyssey">Assassin's Creed Odyssey</a> as a character friendly to the protagonist. He is depicted as being extremely amorous but good-natured, though not above a certain ruthlessness.

Pygmy hippopotamus

The pygmy hippopotamus ("Choeropsis liberiensis" or "Hexaprotodon liberiensis") is a small <a href="Hippopotamidae">hippopotamid</a> which is native to the forests and swamps of <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a>, primarily in <a href="Liberia">Liberia</a>, with small populations in <a href="Sierra%20Leone">Sierra Leone</a>, <a href="Guinea">Guinea</a>, and <a href="Ivory%20Coast">Ivory Coast</a>.

The pygmy hippo is reclusive and <a href="nocturnal">nocturnal</a>. It is one of only two extant species in the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Hippopotamidae">Hippopotamidae</a>, the other being its much larger relative, the common <a href="hippopotamus">hippopotamus</a> ("Hippopotamus amphibius") or Nile hippopotamus. The pygmy hippopotamus displays many terrestrial <a href="adaptation">adaptation</a>s, but like the hippo, it is semiaquatic and relies on water to keep its skin moist and its body temperature cool. Behaviors such as mating and giving birth may occur in water or on land. The pygmy hippo is herbivorous, feeding on ferns, <a href="dicotyledons">broad-leaved plants</a>, <a href="grass">grass</a>es, and <a href="fruit">fruit</a>s it finds in the forests.

A rare <a href="nocturnal">nocturnal</a> forest creature, the pygmy hippopotamus is a difficult animal to study in the wild.
Pygmy hippos were unknown outside West Africa until the 19th century. Introduced to zoos in the early 20th century, they breed well in captivity and the vast majority of research is derived from zoo specimens. The survival of the species in captivity is more assured than in the wild; the <a href="World%20Conservation%20Union">World Conservation Union</a> estimates that fewer than 3,000 pygmy hippos remain in the wild.

Pygmy hippos are primarily threatened by loss of habitat, as forests are logged and converted to farm land, and are also vulnerable to <a href="poaching">poaching</a>, hunting for <a href="bushmeat">bushmeat</a>, natural predators, and war. Pygmy hippos are among the species <a href="Environmental%20issues%20in%20Liberia">illegally hunted for food in Liberia</a>.

Nomenclature of the pygmy hippopotamus reflects that of the <a href="Hippopotamus%23Taxonomy%20and%20origins">hippopotamus</a>. The plural form is pygmy hippopotami ("hippopotamuses" is also accepted as a <a href="English%20plural">plural</a> form by the <a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">OED</a>, or "pygmy hippos" for short). A male pygmy hippopotamus is known as a "bull", a female as a "cow", and a baby as a "calf". A group of hippopotami is known as a "herd" or a "bloat".
The pygmy hippopotamus is a member of the family <a href="Hippopotamidae">Hippopotamidae</a> where it is classified as a member of either the <a href="genus">genus</a> "Choeropsis" ("resembling a <a href="Pig">hog</a>") or, the genus "<a href="Hexaprotodon">Hexaprotodon</a>" ("six front teeth"). Members of Hippopotamidae are sometimes known as hippopotamids. Sometimes the sub-family Hippopotaminae is used. Further, some taxonomists group hippopotami and <a href="anthracotheres">anthracotheres</a> in the superfamily "Anthracotheroidea" or "Hippopotamoidea".

A sister species of the pygmy hippopotamus may have been the little-studied <a href="Malagasy%20Hippopotamus%23C.%20madagascariensis">Malagasy pygmy hippopotamus</a> ("Hexaprotodon madagascariensis" or "Hippopotamus madagascariensis"), one of three recently extinct <a href="Malagasy%20Hippopotamus">species from Madagascar</a>. "C. madagascariensis" was the same size as "C. liberiensis" and shared its terrestrial behavior, inhabiting the forested highlands of Madagascar, rather than open rivers. It is believed to have gone extinct within the last 500 years.

The <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a> of the genus of the pygmy hippopotamus has changed as understanding of the animal has developed. <a href="Samuel%20G.%20Morton">Samuel G. Morton</a> initially classified the animal as "Hippopotamus minor", but later determined it was distinct enough to warrant its own genus, and labeled it "Choeropsis". In 1977, <a href="Shirley%20C.%20Coryndon">Shirley C. Coryndon</a> proposed that the pygmy hippopotamus was closely related to "Hexaprotodon", a genus that consisted of prehistoric hippos mostly native to Asia.

This assertion was widely accepted, until Boisserie asserted in 2005 that the pygmy hippopotamus was not a member of "Hexaprotodon", after a thorough examination of the phylogeny of Hippopotamidae. He suggested instead that the pygmy hippopotamus was a distinct genus, and returned the animal to "Choeropsis". All agree that the modern pygmy hippopotamus, be it "H. liberiensis" or "C. liberiensis", is the only extant member of its genus.

A distinct subspecies of pygmy hippopotamus existed in Nigeria until at least the 20th century, though the validity of this has been questioned. The existence of the subspecies, makes "Choeropsis liberiensis liberiensis" (or "Hexaprotodon liberiensis liberiensis" under the old classification) the full <a href="trinomen">trinomial nomenclature</a> for the Liberian pygmy hippopotamus. The Nigerian pygmy hippopotamus was never studied in the wild and never captured. All research and all zoo specimens are the Liberian subspecies. The Nigerian subspecies is classified as "C. liberiensis heslopi".

The Nigerian pygmy hippopotamus ranged in the <a href="Niger%20River">Niger River Delta</a>, especially near <a href="Port%20Harcourt">Port Harcourt</a>, but no reliable reports exist after the collection of the museum specimens secured by I. R. P. Heslop, a British colonial officer, in the early 1940s. It is probably extinct. The subspecies is separated by over and the <a href="Dahomey%20Gap">Dahomey Gap</a>, a region of savanna that divides the forest regions of West Africa. The subspecies is named after I. R. P. Heslop, who claimed in 1945 to have shot a pygmy hippo in the Niger Delta region and collected several skulls. He estimated that perhaps no more than 30 pygmy hippos remained in the region.

Heslop reportedly sent four pygmy hippopotamus skulls he collected to the British Museum of Natural History in London. These specimens were not subjected to taxonomic evaluation, however, until 1969 when G. B. Corbet classified the skulls as belonging to a separate subspecies based on consistent variations in the proportions of the skulls. The Nigerian pygmy hippos were seen or shot in <a href="Rivers%20State">Rivers State</a>, <a href="Imo%20State">Imo State</a> and <a href="Bayelsa%20State">Bayelsa State</a>, <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>. While some local populations are aware that the species once existed, its history in the region is poorly documented.

The evolution of the pygmy hippopotamus is most often studied in the context of its larger cousin. Both species were long believed to be most closely related to the family <a href="Suidae">Suidae</a> (<a href="pig">pig</a>s and hogs) or Tayassuidae (<a href="peccaries">peccaries</a>), but research within the last 10 years has determined that pygmy hippos and hippos are most closely related to <a href="cetacea">cetacea</a>ns (<a href="whale">whale</a>s and <a href="dolphin">dolphin</a>s). Hippos and whales shared a common semi-aquatic ancestor that branched off from other artiodactyls around .

This hypothesized ancestor likely split into two branches about six million years later. One branch would <a href="Evolution%20of%20cetaceans">evolve into cetaceans</a>, the other branch became the <a href="anthracotheriidae">anthracotheres</a>, a large family of four-legged beasts, whose earliest member, from the Late <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a>, would have resembled narrow hippopotami with comparatively small and thin heads.

Hippopotamids are deeply nested within the family <a href="Anthracotheriidae">Anthracotheriidae</a>. The oldest known hippopotamid is the genus "<a href="Kenyapotamus">Kenyapotamus</a>", which lived in Africa from . "Kenyapotamus" is known only through fragmentary fossils, but was similar in size to "C. liberiensis". The Hippopotamidae are believed to have evolved in Africa, and while at one point the species spread across Asia and Europe, no hippopotami have ever been discovered in the Americas. Starting the "<a href="Archaeopotamus">Archaeopotamus</a>", likely ancestors to the genus "Hippopotamus" and "<a href="Hexaprotodon">Hexaprotodon</a>", lived in Africa and the Middle East.

While the fossil record of hippos is still poorly understood, the lineages of the two modern genera, "Hippopotamus" and "Choeropsis", may have diverged as far back as . The ancestral form of the pygmy hippopotamus may be the genus "Saotherium". "Saotherium" and "Choeropsis" are significantly more <a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> than "Hippopotamus" and "Hexaprotodon", and thus more closely resemble the ancestral species of hippos.

Several species of small hippopotamids have also become extinct in the Mediterranean in the late <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> or early <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a>. Though these species are sometimes known as "pygmy hippopotami" they are not believed to be closely related to "C. liberiensis". These include the <a href="Cretan%20Dwarf%20Hippopotamus">Cretan dwarf hippopotamus</a> ("Hippopotamus creutzburgi"), the Sicilian hippopotamus ("<a href="Hippopotamus%20pentlandi">Hippopotamus pentlandi</a>"), the Maltese hippopotamus ("<a href="Hippopotamus%20melitensis">Hippopotamus melitensis</a>") and the <a href="Cyprus%20Dwarf%20Hippopotamus">Cyprus dwarf hippopotamus</a> ("Hippopotamus minor").

These species, though comparable in size to the pygmy hippopotamus, are considered dwarf hippopotamuses, rather than pygmies. They are likely descended from a full-sized species of <a href="European%20Hippopotamus">European hippopotamus</a>, and reached their small size through the evolutionary process of <a href="insular%20dwarfism">insular dwarfism</a> which is common on islands; the ancestors of pygmy hippopotami were also small and thus there was never a dwarfing process. There were also several species of pygmy hippo on the island of Madagascar (see <a href="Malagasy%20Hippopotamus">Malagasy hippopotamus</a>).

Pygmy hippos share the same general form as a hippopotamus. They have a graviportal skeleton, with four stubby legs and four toes on each foot, supporting a portly frame. The pygmy hippo, however, is only half as tall as the hippopotamus and weighs less than 1/4 as much as its larger cousin. Adult pygmy hippos stand about high at the shoulder, are in length and weigh . Their lifespan in captivity ranges from 30 to 55 years, though it is unlikely that they live this long in the wild.

The skin is greenish-black or brown, shading to a creamy gray on the lower body. Their skin is very similar to the common hippo's, with a thin <a href="Epidermis%20%28skin%29">epidermis</a> over a <a href="dermis">dermis</a> that is several centimeters thick. Pygmy hippos have the same unusual <a href="secretion">secretion</a> as common hippos, that gives a pinkish tinge to their bodies, and is sometimes described as "blood sweat" though the secretion is neither <a href="sweat">sweat</a> nor <a href="blood">blood</a>. This substance, <a href="hipposudoric%20acid">hipposudoric acid</a>, is believed to have antiseptic and <a href="sunscreen">sunscreen</a>ing properties. The skin of hippos dries out quickly and cracks, which is why both species spend so much time in water.

The skeleton of "C. liberiensis" is more <a href="wikt%3Agracile">gracile</a> than that of the common hippopotamus, meaning their bones are proportionally thinner. The common hippo's spine is parallel with the ground; the pygmy hippo's back slopes forward, a likely <a href="adaptation">adaptation</a> to pass more easily through dense forest vegetation. Proportionally, the pygmy hippo's legs and neck are longer and its head smaller.
The <a href="Orbit%20%28anatomy%29">orbits</a> and <a href="nostril">nostril</a>s of a pygmy hippo are much less pronounced, an adaptation from spending less time in deep water (where pronounced orbits and nostrils help the common hippo breathe and see). The feet of pygmy hippos are narrower, but the toes are more spread out and have less webbing, to assist in walking on the forest floor.

Despite adaptations to a more terrestrial life than the common hippopotamus, pygmy hippos are still more aquatic than all other <a href="even-toed%20ungulate">even-toed ungulate</a>s. The ears and nostrils of pygmy hippos have strong muscular valves to aid submerging underwater, and the skin physiology is dependent on the availability of water.

The behavior of the pygmy hippo differs from the common hippo in many ways. Much of its behavior is more similar to that of a <a href="tapir">tapir</a>, though this is an effect of <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent evolution</a>. While the common hippopotamus is gregarious, pygmy hippos live either alone or in small groups, typically a mated pair or a mother and calf. Pygmy hippos tend to ignore each other rather than fight when they meet. Field studies have estimated that male pygmy hippos range over , while the range of a female is .

Pygmy hippos spend most of the day hidden in rivers. They will rest in the same spot for several days in a row, before moving to a new spot. At least some pygmy hippos make use of dens or <a href="burrow">burrow</a>s that form in river banks. It is unknown if the pygmy hippos help create these dens, or how common it is to use them. Though a pygmy hippo has never been observed burrowing, other artiodactyls, such as <a href="warthog">warthog</a>s, are burrowers.

Like the common hippopotamus, the pygmy hippo emerges from the water at dusk to feed. It relies on game trails to travel through dense forest vegetation. It marks trails by vigorously waving its tail while defecating to further spread its feces. The pygmy hippo spends about six hours a day foraging for food.
Pygmy hippos are <a href="herbivore">herbivorous</a>. They do not eat aquatic vegetation to a significant extent and rarely eat grass because it is uncommon in the thick forests they inhabit. The bulk of a pygmy hippo's diet consists of <a href="fern">fern</a>s, <a href="dicotyledons">broad-leaved plants</a> and <a href="fruit">fruit</a>s that have fallen to the forest floor. The wide variety of plants pygmy hippos have been observed eating suggests that they will eat any plants available. This diet is of higher quality than that of the common hippopotamus.

A study of breeding behavior in the wild has never been conducted; the artificial conditions of captivity may cause the observed behavior of pygmy hippos in zoos to differ from natural conditions. Sexual maturity for the pygmy hippopotamus occurs between three and five years of age. The youngest reported age for giving birth is a pygmy hippo in the <a href="Zoo%20Basel">Zoo Basel</a>, <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> which bore a calf at three years and three months. The <a href="oestrus%20cycle">oestrus cycle</a> of a female pygmy hippo lasts an average of 35.5 days, with the oestrus itself lasting between 24–48 hours.

Pygmy hippos consort for mating, but the duration of the relationship is unknown. In zoos they breed as monogamous pairs. Copulation can take place on land or in the water, and a pair will mate one to four times during an oestrus period. In captivity, pygmy hippos have been conceived and born in all months of the year. The gestation period ranges from 190–210 days, and usually a single young is born, though twins are known to occur.

The common hippopotamus gives birth and mates only in the water, but pygmy hippos mate and give birth on both land and water. Young pygmy hippos can swim almost immediately. At birth, pygmy hippos weigh 4.5–6.2 kg (9.9–13.7 lb) with males weighing about 0.25 kg (0.55 lb) more than females. Pygmy hippos are fully <a href="wean">wean</a>ed between six and eight months of age; before weaning they do not accompany their mother when she leaves the water to forage, but instead hide in the water by themselves. The mother returns to the hiding spot about three times a day and calls out for the calf to suckle. Suckling occurs with the mother lying on her side.

The greatest threat to the remaining pygmy hippopotamus population in the wild is loss of habitat. The forests in which pygmy hippos live have been subject to logging, settling and conversion to agriculture, with little efforts made to make logging sustainable. As forests shrink, the populations become more fragmented, leading to less genetic diversity in the potential mating pool.

Pygmy hippos are among the species <a href="Environmental%20issues%20in%20Liberia">illegally hunted for food in Liberia</a>. Their meat is said to be of excellent quality, like that of a wild boar; unlike those of the common hippo, the pygmy hippo's teeth have no value. The effects of West Africa's civil strife on the pygmy hippopotamus are unknown, but unlikely to be positive. The pygmy hippopotamus can be killed by <a href="leopard">leopard</a>s, <a href="Pythonidae">pythons</a> and <a href="crocodile">crocodile</a>s. How often this occurs is unknown.

"C. liberiensis" was identified as one of the top-10 "focal species" in 2007 by the <a href="EDGE%20Species">Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered</a> (EDGE) project. Some populations inhabit protected areas, such as the <a href="Gola%20West">Gola Forest Reserve</a> in Sierra Leone.

<a href="Basel%20Zoo">Basel Zoo</a> in Switzerland holds the international <a href="studbook">studbook</a> and coordinates the entire captive pygmy hippo population that freely breeds in zoos around the world. Between 1970 and 1991 the population of pygmy hippos born in captivity more than doubled. The survival of the species in zoos is more certain than the survival of the species in the wild. In captivity, the pygmy hippo lives from 42 to 55 years, longer than in the wild. Since 1919, only 41 percent of pygmy hippos born in zoos have been male.

While the common hippopotamus was known to Europeans since <a href="classical%20antiquity">classical antiquity</a>, the pygmy hippopotamus was unknown outside its range in West Africa until the 19th century. Due to their nocturnal, forested existence, they were poorly known within their range as well. In Liberia the animal was traditionally known as a "water cow".

Early field reports of the animal misidentified it as a <a href="wild%20hog">wild hog</a>. Several skulls of the species were sent to the American natural scientist <a href="Samuel%20G.%20Morton">Samuel G. Morton</a>, during his residency in <a href="Monrovia">Monrovia</a>, <a href="Liberia">Liberia</a>. Morton first described the species in 1843. The first complete specimens were collected as part of a comprehensive investigation of Liberian fauna in the 1870s and 1880s by Dr. <a href="Johann%20B%C3%BCttikofer">Johann Büttikofer</a>. The specimens were taken to the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20Leiden">Natural History Museum</a> in <a href="Leiden">Leiden</a>, The <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>.

The first pygmy hippo was brought to Europe in 1873 after being captured in Sierra Leone by a member of the British Colonial Service but died shortly after arrival. Pygmy hippos were successfully introduced to Europe in 1911. They were first shipped to Germany and then to the <a href="Bronx%20Zoo">Bronx Zoo</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> where they also thrived.

In 1927, <a href="Harvey%20Firestone">Harvey Firestone</a> of <a href="Firestone%20Tire%20and%20Rubber%20Company">Firestone Tires</a> presented <a href="Billy%20%28pygmy%20hippo%29">Billy the pygmy hippo</a> to U.S. President <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a>. Coolidge donated Billy to the <a href="National%20Zoological%20Park%20%28United%20States%29">National Zoo in Washington, D.C.</a> According to the zoo, Billy is a common ancestor to most pygmy hippos in U.S. zoos today.

Several folktales have been collected about the pygmy hippopotamus. One tale says that pygmy hippos carry a shining diamond in their mouths to help travel through thick forests at night; by day the pygmy hippo has a secret hiding place for the diamond, but if a hunter catches a pygmy hippo at night the diamond can be taken. Villagers sometimes believed that baby pygmy hippos do not nurse but rather lick secretions off the skin of the mother.

Epacris impressa

Epacris impressa, also known as common heath, is a plant of the heath family, <a href="Ericaceae">Ericaceae</a>, that is native to southeast Australia (the states of <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>, <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> and <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>). French botanist <a href="Jacques%20Labillardi%C3%A8re">Jacques Labillardière</a> collected the species in 1793 and <a href="species%20description">described</a> it in 1805. Four forms have been identified, but no subspecies are recognised. Growing in heathland, shrubland or open forest, it is generally a small shrub around tall, with small stiff leaves. The red, pink or white tube-like flowers appear from late autumn to early spring. <a href="Honeyeater">Honeyeater</a> birds, particularly the <a href="eastern%20spinebill">eastern spinebill</a>, feed upon the nectar of the flowers. It regenerates after <a href="bushfire">bushfire</a> by seed or by <a href="Resprouter">resprouting</a>.

A highly regarded garden plant, the common heath was first cultivated in England in 1825; over seventy named <a href="cultivar">cultivar</a>s have been developed, most of which have now vanished. A pink-flowered form, often referred to as "pink heath", is the <a href="floral%20emblem">floral emblem</a> of the state of <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>. "Epacris impressa" has proven a difficult plant to <a href="Plant%20propagation">propagate</a> reliably, which has limited its use in horticulture and revegetation. It grows best in well-drained but moist soil in a semishaded position.

"Epacris impressa" grows as a woody shrub with an erect <a href="Habit%20%28biology%29">habit</a>, sometimes reaching in height although plants in the range of tall are more commonly observed. The branches are stiff and have small leaves with prickly, pointed apices that are long. The flowers mainly occur between late autumn and early spring, arising in dense and sometimes pendulous clusters along the stems. White, pink or red in colour, they are and are narrow and tubular with five indentations on the base. The <a href="Catacorolla">corolla</a> of the flower is formed by five <a href="petal">petal</a>s, fused at the base to form a tubelike structure, with the free petal ends forming five lobes at the apex. There are five whorled <a href="sepal">sepal</a>s at the base of the corolla. Within the corolla is a central <a href="Gynoecium%23the%20stigma%20and%20style">style</a> that persists through development of the fruit. The style connects the <a href="Stigma%20%28botany%29">stigma</a> at the apex and <a href="Ovary%20%28botany%29">ovary</a> at the base, where the <a href="nectar">nectar</a> is also located. Different colour forms are often observed growing near each other. The fruit is a 5-<a href="locule">locule</a> capsule that is about in diameter. It is globular in shape, sometimes with one end flattened. Initially green, it dries and splits, releasing numerous tiny seeds.

The <a href="type%20specimen">type specimen</a> of common heath was collected in 1793 by French botanist <a href="Jacques%20Labillardi%C3%A8re">Jacques Labillardière</a> in <a href="Van%20Diemen%27s%20Land">Van Diemen's Land</a> (now Tasmania) during a voyage with <a href="Antoine%20Bruni%20d%27Entrecasteaux">Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux</a>. Labillardière <a href="species%20description">described</a> it in his 1805 work "<a href="Novae%20Hollandiae%20Plantarum%20Specimen">Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen</a>", giving it its current name "Epacris impressa". The Latin <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> "impressa" (meaning "impressed" or "indented") alludes to the indentations on the floral tube. The original mounted specimen is currently held at the <a href="National%20Herbarium%20of%20Victoria">National Herbarium of Victoria</a> at the <a href="Royal%20Botanic%20Gardens%2C%20Melbourne">Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne</a>.

A number of specimens once described as separate species are now regarded as "Epacris impressa", with no recognised subspecies. Scottish botanist <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28Scottish%20botanist%20from%20Montrose%29">Robert Brown</a> described "Epacris ruscifolia" in his 1810 work "<a href="Prodromus%20Florae%20Novae%20Hollandiae%20et%20Insulae%20Van%20Diemen">Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen</a>" alongside "E. impressa". <a href="John%20Lindley">John Lindley</a> described "Epacris tomentosa" from plant specimens collected during the third expedition of <a href="Thomas%20Mitchell%20%28explorer%29">Thomas Mitchell</a> in 1838. Upon encountering "Epacris impressa" on <a href="Mount%20William%20%28Mount%20Duwil%29">Mount William</a> in the Grampians, Mitchell remarked that it was "A most beautiful downy-leaved Epacris with large, curved, purple flowers, allied to "<a href="Epacris%20longiflora">E. grandiflora</a>" but much handsomer". Dr <a href="Robert%20Graham%20%28botanist%29">Robert Graham</a> described "Epacris ceriflora" (which he spelt "ceraeflora") from plants cultivated at the Edinburgh Botanic Gardens in 1832. The seed had come from Tasmania, the resulting progeny flowering over April and May 1832. A year later, he described "E. nivalis", which he called an "exceedingly beautiful species", from specimens growing in <a href="Loddiges">Loddiges</a> nursery. He also noted a form with long corollas that had been called "E. variabilis" that was in cultivation at the time, and noted it was difficult to describe the precise characteristics that distinguished "E. ceraeflora", "E. nivalis", "E. variabilis" and "E. impressa".

In his landmark "<a href="Flora%20Australiensis">Flora Australiensis</a>" (1869), <a href="George%20Bentham">George Bentham</a> argued that several previously described species were in fact a single species – "E. impressa", uniting "E. variabilis", a short red-flowered "E. campanulata", "E. ruscifolia", which had narrow leaves and long flowers, the white-flowered "E. nivalis", and short white-flowered "E. ceraeflora". He re-classified as a separate species – "<a href="Epacris%20reclinata">E. reclinata</a>" – several plants that <a href="Allan%20Cunningham%20%28botanist%29">Allan Cunningham</a> had collected in the <a href="Blue%20Mountains%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Blue Mountains</a> and classified as "E. impressa".

In the same work, Bentham named and described two naturally occurring varieties, "Epacris impressa" var. "grandiflora" and "E. impressa" var. "ovata". Plant specimens designated as "grandiflora" had been collected in the <a href="Wimmera">Wimmera</a>, the <a href="Grampians%20National%20Park">Grampians</a> (including those previously designated as "E. tomentosa") and at <a href="Stawell%2C%20Victoria">Stawell</a> in Victoria. Those classified as "ovata" were collected at <a href="Twofold%20Bay">Twofold Bay</a> and <a href="Mount%20Imlay">Mount Imlay</a> in southeastern New South Wales as well as <a href="Cape%20Grim">Woolnorth</a> and <a href="Rocky%20Cape%20National%20Park">Rocky Cape</a> in northern Tasmania. Bentham noted that, although variable, all forms had "five impressed cavities outside, alternating with the stamens immediately above the ovary."

In his 1972 publication "A Handbook to Plants in Victoria", Australian botanist <a href="James%20Hamlyn%20Willis">Jim Willis</a> expressed his view that dividing the species into subspecies was not feasible given that common heath is highly variable in flower colour and leaf shape, though he conceded the Grampians race "grandiflora" might be distinctive based on its larger <a href="Catacorolla">corolla</a>s and coarser and hairier foliage. Currently, both "grandiflora" and "ovata" are regarded as synonyms of "Epacris impressa" rather than being classified as distinct varieties. The plant populations that best fit Bentham's original description of "grandiflora", also known as Grampians heath, occur naturally on <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> at locations including Mount Zero, Mount Stapylton and the <a href="Black%20Range%20State%20Park">Black Range</a>. Other nearby populations are regarded as having intermediate characteristics, including those in the Victoria Range and <a href="Mount%20Arapiles">Mount Arapiles</a>. Although not recognised in the <a href="Australian%20Plant%20Census">Australian Plant Census</a>, the variety is noted as "rare" on the list of "Advisory List of Rare or Threatened Plants in Victoria" issued by the <a href="Department%20of%20Environment%20and%20Primary%20Industries">Department of Environment and Primary Industries</a>.

In 1977 Helen Stace and Yvonne Fripp from <a href="La%20Trobe%20University">La Trobe University</a> studied 195 populations of "Epacris impressa" in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania and found that 120 consisted of mixed stands of two or more <a href="Race%20%28biology%29">races</a> while 75 populations were of one race only. They identified four races based on the following corolla characteristics:

The long-pink and short-white races frequently occur in close proximity to each other; in these mixed populations the former tends to flower in winter and the latter in spring. The question has been raised whether these different forms are becoming incompatible. However, controlled cross-pollination between plants with short and long corollas showed that there was no incompatibility between them.

Pink-flowering populations have a relatively distinct <a href="genome">genetic makeup</a>, whereas red or white flowering populations have more evident sharing of genetic traits. Research based on <a href="DNA%20profiling">DNA profiling</a> has revealed substantial genetic diversity within and between flower colour races and site populations. This has implications for vegetation projects in that <a href="provenance">provenance</a> material needs to be collected from a wide geographic area to maintain this diversity.

"Epacris impressa" is commonly found in coastal regions and nearby foothills, ranging from <a href="Kangaroo%20Island">Kangaroo Island</a> and the southern <a href="Mount%20Lofty%20Ranges">Mount Lofty Ranges</a> in <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> across southern Victoria, extending to the <a href="Grampians%20National%20Park">Grampians</a> and the <a href="Little%20Desert">Little Desert</a>, and northwards to southern <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> as far as the <a href="Clyde%20River%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Clyde River</a> in the <a href="Budawang%20Range">Budawang Range</a>. It is also widespread in <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>. Plants are recorded at altitudes up to at Mount Stradbroke and Mount Tingaringy in <a href="East%20Gippsland">East Gippsland</a>. The species grows in widely diverse habitats including sand and clay heathland, herb-rich and heathy woodland, lowland and shrubby dry forests, riparian thickets, montane rocky shrubland and rocky outcrops.

<a href="Honeyeater">Honeyeater</a>s such as the <a href="eastern%20spinebill">eastern spinebill</a> are attracted to the flowers. As the bird gathers the nectar, the pollen, which has fins, attaches itself to the feathers on the heads of the birds and is carried to other flowers, aiding <a href="cross%20pollination">cross pollination</a>. A study in forests near <a href="Hobart">Hobart</a> in Tasmania found that the eastern spinebill arrived in the area at the same time the common heath was in flower in March, and left once flowering had finished. Other honeyeaters, such as the <a href="strong-billed%20honeyeater">strong-billed</a>, <a href="crescent%20honeyeater">crescent</a> and <a href="yellow-throated%20honeyeater">yellow-throated honeyeater</a>s, fed occasionally at common heath flowers. Field work in the <a href="Mount%20Lofty%20Ranges">Mount Lofty Ranges</a> in South Australia recorded the <a href="white-plumed%20honeyeater">white-plumed</a> and <a href="New%20Holland%20honeyeater">New Holland honeyeater</a>s, as well as the crescent honeyeater and the eastern spinebill.

Insects recorded visiting white-flowered plants include the <a href="Australian%20painted%20lady">Australian painted lady</a> ("Vanessa kershawi") and <a href="yellow%20admiral">yellow admiral</a> ("V. itea"), as well as bees. Field work in southern Tasmania showed that the introduced bumblebee ("<a href="Bombus%20terrestris">Bombus terrestris</a>") sometimes robbed nectar by piercing the base of the tube. This then allowed honeybees ("<a href="Western%20honey%20bee">Apis mellifera</a>") to retrieve nectar the same way. "Epacris impressa" is host to the <a href="scale%20insect">scale insect</a> "<a href="Lecanodiaspis%20microcribraria">Lecanodiaspis microcribraria</a>".

A field study of the invasion of the pathogen "<a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">Phytophthora cinnamomi</a>" into the <a href="Brisbane%20Ranges%20National%20Park">Brisbane Ranges National Park</a> in Victoria in 1971 indicated that "Epacris impressa" was moderately susceptible to the pathogen. Inoculation of seedlings confirmed this. Fieldwork in the Brisbane Ranges National Park in 1985 showed that there was some evidence that "E. impressa" seedlings were able to recolonise areas that had been infested with "P. cinnamomi" a decade before.

"Epacris impressa" regenerates after <a href="bushfire">bushfire</a> by seed and <a href="Resprouter">resprouting</a>. Fieldwork in heathland in the <a href="Otway%20Ranges">Otway Ranges</a> in the years following the 1983 <a href="Ash%20Wednesday%20bushfires">Ash Wednesday bushfires</a> showed that large numbers of "E. impressa" seedlings appeared in some areas, and that flowering took place as early as the second year after the fire.

The roots of "Epacris impressa" are colonized by fungi forming <a href="ericoid%20mycorrhiza">ericoid mycorrhiza</a>. It is believed that the fungal species vary between regions.

Propagated from seed collected by <a href="William%20Baxter%20%28botanist%29">William Baxter</a> in southern Australia, common heath was introduced into cultivation in England by the <a href="Clapton%20Nursery">Clapton Nursery</a> in 1825. Due to its frost-tenderness, it was mostly restricted to <a href="greenhouse">greenhouse</a> cultivation. In 1873, a variety known as "Epacris impressa alba" was recorded as being grown commercially for <a href="cut%20flowers">cut flowers</a> in Boston in the United States. While initially popular – over seventy cultivars appeared in the literature at the time – most have since disappeared.

Plants grow best in a moist but well-drained, acidic soil, with added <a href="peat">peat</a> being helpful. They may be grown in coastal gardens in a sheltered position, and generally require some degree of shade. Once established, plants can tolerate short dry spells. As they age, plants may become straggly, but benefit from hard <a href="pruning">pruning</a> after fertilizing and watering, which promotes compact, bushier growth. Common heath can be short-lived and difficult to <a href="transplanting">transplant</a>, though it can be readily grown as a pot plant. Along with other members of the genus, "Epacris impressa" initially proved difficult to grow and maintain on original soil in the <a href="Australian%20National%20Botanic%20Gardens">Australian National Botanic Gardens</a> in Canberra.

<a href="Plant%20propagation">Propagation</a> both by seed and cuttings is difficult, reducing potential production by plant nurseries. Germination rates of <a href="soil%20seed%20bank">soil-stored seeds</a> have been found to increase substantially with the application of heat and aqueous solutions of smoke. The most satisfactory results from cuttings can be achieved by using tip growth, taken six weeks after the cessation of flowering, and kept under a fogging system for twenty weeks. Plantsman Neil Marriott recommends semi-hardened cutting material taken in spring and autumn. Roots of cuttings are brittle and easily damaged.

The following forms have been selected and grown for cultivation:

This is a form from <a href="Bega%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bega</a> in southern New South Wales that has bright red flowers and grows to high. It is regarded as one of the more reliable forms in cultivation. White- and pink-flowered forms from the same region also have horticultural potential.


'Cranbourne Bells' is a <a href="double-flowered">double-flowered</a> form with pink flower buds fading to white as they open. Registered by the <a href="Australian%20Cultivar%20Registration%20Authority">Australian Cultivar Registration Authority</a> in 1988, it occurred naturally near the <a href="Royal%20Botanic%20Gardens%2C%20Cranbourne">Royal Botanic Gardens Cranbourne</a> in Victoria, but its habitat has since been cleared. A double-flowered form of "Epacris impressa" was collected as early as the 1860s in Victoria when Government Botanist <a href="Ferdinand%20von%20Mueller">Ferdinand von Mueller</a> sent a specimen to <a href="Royal%20Botanic%20Gardens%2C%20Kew">Kew Gardens</a>. This was examined by botanist <a href="William%20Hemsley%20%28botanist%29">William Hemsley</a> in 1865. The specimen, labelled as "Epacris impressa" var. "pleniflora", originated from <a href="Stawell%2C%20Victoria">Stawell</a> in western Victoria. Another specimen given the same name by Mueller was collected at <a href="Nunawading">Nunawading</a>, today a suburb of Melbourne. <a href="Charles%20French%20%28entomologist%29">Charles French</a>, co-founder of the <a href="Field%20Naturalists%20Club%20of%20Victoria">Field Naturalists Club of Victoria</a>, collected a white double-flowered form from <a href="Cheltenham%2C%20Victoria">Cheltenham</a> south of Melbourne in 1859 and a pink double-flowered form from <a href="Dromana%2C%20Victoria">Dromana</a> on the Mornington Peninsula in about 1862. These were later sent as rooted cuttings to <a href="Veitch%20Nurseries">Veitch Nurseries</a> in England. Double-flowered forms of various colours have since been found throughout Victoria, but only single plants have been observed in any location, and they are still regarded as a rarity. A naturally occurring form of the variety "grandiflora" with rosebud-like double flowers is also grown.

A form with deep pink flowers on long spikes, 'Spring Pink' appears in spring. It grows to high.

At a meeting of representatives of government and other bodies in 1951 it was agreed that the pink form of the common heath, the "pink heath", be adopted as the official <a href="floral%20emblem">floral emblem</a> for the state of Victoria. Victoria was the first Australian state to adopt a floral emblem. The proclamation, made on 11 November 1958 by Governor <a href="Dallas%20Brooks">Dallas Brooks</a>, was as follows:

The Red Badge of Courage

The Red Badge of Courage is a <a href="war%20novel">war novel</a> by American author <a href="Stephen%20Crane">Stephen Crane</a> (1871–1900). Taking place during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, the story is about a young <a href="Private%20%28rank%29">private</a> of the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a>, Henry Fleming, who flees from the field of battle. Overcome with shame, he longs for a wound, a "red badge of courage," to counteract his cowardice. When his regiment once again faces the enemy, Henry acts as <a href="standard-bearer">standard-bearer</a>, who carries a flag.

Although Crane was born after the war, and had not at the time experienced battle first-hand, the novel is known for its <a href="literary%20realism">realism</a> and naturalism. He began writing what would become his second novel in 1894, using various contemporary and written accounts (such as those published previously by "<a href="The%20Century%20Magazine">Century Magazine</a>") as inspiration. It is believed that he based the fictional battle on that of <a href="Battle%20of%20Chancellorsville">Chancellorsville</a>; he may also have interviewed veterans of the <a href="124th%20New%20York%20Volunteer%20Infantry%20Regiment">124th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment</a>, commonly known as the Orange Blossoms. Initially shortened and serialized in newspapers in December 1894, the novel was published in full in October 1895. A longer version of the work, based on Crane's original manuscript, was published in 1983.

The novel is known for its distinctive style, which includes realistic battle sequences as well as the repeated use of color imagery, and ironic tone. Separating itself from a traditional war narrative, Crane's story reflects the inner experience of its protagonist (a soldier fleeing from combat) rather than the external world around him. Also notable for its use of what Crane called a "psychological portrayal of fear", the novel's <a href="allegory">allegorical</a> and symbolic qualities are often debated by critics. Several of the themes that the story explores are maturation, heroism, cowardice, and the indifference of nature. "The Red Badge of Courage" garnered widespread acclaim, what <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a> called "an orgy of praise", shortly after its publication, making Crane an instant celebrity at the age of twenty-four. The novel and its author did have their initial detractors, however, including author and veteran <a href="Ambrose%20Bierce">Ambrose Bierce</a>. Adapted several times for the screen, the novel became a bestseller. It has never been out of print and is now thought to be Crane's most important work and a major American text.

Stephen Crane published his first novel, "", in March 1893 at the age of 22. "Maggie" was not a success, either financially or critically. Most critics thought the unsentimental <a href="Bowery">Bowery</a> tale crude or vulgar, and Crane chose to publish the work privately after it was repeatedly rejected for publication. Crane found inspiration for his next novel while spending hours lounging in a friend's studio in the early summer of 1893. There, he became fascinated with issues of "<a href="The%20Century%20Magazine">Century Magazine</a>" that were largely devoted to famous battles and military leaders from the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>. Frustrated with the dryly written stories, Crane stated, "I wonder that some of those fellows don't tell how they "felt" in those scraps. They spout enough of what they "did", but they're as emotionless as rocks." Returning to these magazines during subsequent visits to the studio, he decided to write a war novel. He later stated that he "had been unconsciously working the detail of the story out through most of his boyhood" and had imagined "war stories ever since he was out of knickerbockers."

At the time, Crane was intermittently employed as a free-lance writer, contributing articles to various New York City newspapers. He began writing what would become "The Red Badge of Courage" in June 1893, while living with his older brother Edmund in <a href="Paterson%2C%20New%20Jersey">Lake View, New Jersey</a>. Crane conceived the story from the point of view of a young private who is at first filled with boyish dreams of the glory of war, only to become disillusioned by war's reality. He took the private's surname, "Fleming," from his sister-in-law's maiden name. He would later relate that the first paragraphs came to him with "every word in place, every comma, every period fixed." Working mostly nights, he wrote from around midnight until four or five in the morning. Because he could not afford a typewriter, he carefully wrote in ink on legal-sized paper, occasionally crossing through or overlying a word. If he changed something, he would rewrite the whole page. He later moved to New York City, where he completed the novel in April 1894.

The title of Crane's original, 55,000-word manuscript was "Private Fleming/His various battles", but in order to create the sense of a less traditional Civil War narrative, he ultimately changed the title to "The Red Badge of Courage: An Episode of the American Civil War". In early 1894, Crane submitted the manuscript to <a href="S.%20S.%20McClure">S. S. McClure</a>, who held on to it for six months without publication. Frustrated, the author asked for the manuscript to be returned, after which he gave it to <a href="Irving%20Bacheller">Irving Bacheller</a> in October. An abbreviated version of Crane's story was first <a href="serial%20%28literature%29">serialized</a> in "<a href="Philadelphia%20Press">The Philadelphia Press</a>" in December 1894. This version of the story, which was culled to 18,000 words by an editor specifically for the serialization, was reprinted in newspapers across America, establishing Crane's fame. Crane biographer <a href="John%20Berryman">John Berryman</a> wrote that the story was published in at least 200 small city dailies and approximately 550 weekly papers. In October 1895, a version, which was 5,000 words shorter than the original manuscript, was printed in book form by <a href="D.%20Appleton%20%26amp%3B%20Company">D. Appleton & Company</a>. This version of the novel differed greatly from Crane's original manuscript; the deletions were thought by some scholars to be due to demands by an Appleton employee who was afraid of public disapproval of the novel's content. Parts of the original manuscript removed from the 1895 version include all of the twelfth chapter, as well as the endings to chapters seven, ten and fifteen.

Crane's contract with Appleton allowed him to receive a flat ten percent royalty of all copies sold. However, the contract also stipulated that he was not to receive royalties from the books sold in Great Britain, where they were released by <a href="Heinemann%20%28publisher%29">Heinemann</a> in early 1896 as part of its Pioneer Series. In 1982, <a href="W.%20W.%20Norton%20%26amp%3B%20Company">W. W. Norton & Company</a> published a version of the novel based on Crane's original 1894 manuscript of 55,000 words. Edited by Henry Binder, this version is questioned by those who believe Crane made the original edits for the 1895 Appleton edition on his own accord. Since its initial publication, the novel has never gone out of print.

On a cold day, the fictional 304th New York Infantry Regiment awaits battle beside a river. Eighteen-year-old Private Henry Fleming, remembering his romantic reasons for enlisting as well as his mother's resulting protests, wonders whether he will remain brave in the face of fear or turn and run. He is comforted by one of his friends from home, Jim Conklin, who admits that he would run from battle if his fellow soldiers also fled. During the regiment's first battle, Confederate soldiers charge, but are repelled. The enemy quickly regroups and attacks again, this time forcing some of the unprepared Union soldiers to flee. Fearing the battle is a lost cause, Henry <a href="desertion">deserts</a> his regiment. It is not until after he reaches the rear of the army that he overhears a general announcing the Union's victory.
Ashamed, Henry escapes into a nearby forest, where he discovers a decaying body in a peaceful clearing. In his distress, he hurriedly leaves the clearing and stumbles upon a group of injured men returning from battle. One member of the group, a "tattered soldier", asks Henry where he is wounded, but the youth dodges the question. Among the group is Jim Conklin, who has been shot in the side and is suffering delirium from blood loss. Jim eventually dies of his injury, defiantly resisting aid from his friend, and an enraged and helpless Henry runs from the wounded soldiers. He next joins a retreating column that is in disarray. In the ensuing panic, a man hits Henry on the head with his rifle, wounding him. Exhausted, hungry, thirsty, and now wounded, Henry decides to return to his regiment regardless of his shame. When he arrives at camp, the other soldiers believe his injury resulted from a grazing bullet during battle. The other men care for the youth, dressing his wound.

The next morning Henry goes into battle for the third time. His regiment encounters a small group of Confederates, and in the ensuing fight Henry proves to be a capable soldier, comforted by the belief that his previous cowardice had not been noticed, as he "had performed his mistakes in the dark, so he was still a man". Afterward, while looking for a stream from which to obtain water with a friend, he discovers from the commanding officer that his regiment has a lackluster reputation. The officer speaks casually about sacrificing the 304th because they are nothing more than "mule drivers" and "mud diggers." With no other regiments to spare, the general orders his men forward.

In the final battle, Henry acts as the <a href="Standard-bearer">flag-bearer</a> after the color sergeant falls. A line of Confederates hidden behind a fence beyond a clearing shoots with impunity at Henry's regiment, which is ill-covered in the tree-line. Facing withering fire if they stay and disgrace if they retreat, the officers order a charge. Unarmed, Henry leads the men while entirely escaping injury. Most of the Confederates run before the regiment arrives, and four of the remaining men are taken <a href="Prisoner%20of%20war">prisoner</a>. The novel closes with the following passage:

Although Crane once wrote in a letter, "You can tell nothing... unless you are in that condition yourself," he wrote "The Red Badge of Courage" without any experience of war. He would, however, later serve as a <a href="war%20correspondent">war correspondent</a> during the <a href="Greco-Turkish%20War%20%281897%29">Greco-Turkish</a> and <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a>s. Nevertheless, the realistic portrayal of the battlefield in "The Red Badge of Courage" has often misled readers into thinking that Crane (despite being born six years after the end of the Civil War) was himself a veteran. While trying to explain his ability to write about battle realistically, Crane stated: "Of course, I have never been in a battle, but I believe that I got my sense of the rage of conflict on the football field, or else fighting is a hereditary instinct, and I wrote intuitively; for the Cranes were a family of fighters in the old days".

Crane drew from a variety of sources in order to realistically depict battle. "Century" "Battles and Leaders" series served as direct inspiration for the novel, and one story in particular (Warren Lee Goss's "Recollections of a Private") contains many parallels to Crane's work. <a href="Thomas%20Beer">Thomas Beer</a> wrote in his problematic 1923 biography that Crane was challenged by a friend to write "The Red Badge of Courage" after having announced that he could do better than <a href="%C3%89mile%20Zola">Émile Zola</a>'s "<a href="La%20D%C3%A9b%C3%A2cle">La Débâcle</a>". This anecdote, however, has not been substantiated. The metaphor of the "red badge of courage" itself may have been inspired by true events; historian Cecil D. Eby, Jr. noted that Union officer <a href="Philip%20Kearny">Philip Kearny</a>'s insisted his troops wear bright red <a href="American%20Civil%20War%20Corps%20Badges">unit insignia patches</a>, which became known as marks of valor and bravery. While the 304th New York Volunteer Infantry is fictional, many strategies and occurrences in the novel echo actual events during the Civil War. Details concerning specific campaigns during the war, especially regarding battle formations and actions during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chancellorsville">Battle of Chancellorsville</a>, have been noted by critics.

It is believed that Crane listened to war stories in the town square of <a href="Port%20Jervis%2C%20New%20York">Port Jervis, New York</a> (where his family at times resided) told by members of the <a href="124th%20New%20York%20Volunteer%20Infantry%20Regiment">124th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment</a>, commonly known as the Orange Blossoms. The Orange Blossoms first saw battle at Chancellorsville, which is believed by local historians to have been the inspiration for the battle depicted in "The Red Badge of Courage". Furthermore, there was a Private James Conklin who served in the 124th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, and Crane's short story "The Veteran", which was published in "McClure's Magazine" the year after "The Red Badge of Courage", depicts an elderly Henry Fleming who specifically identifies his first combat experience as having occurred at Chancellorsville.

"The Red Badge of Courage" has a distinctive style, which is often described as <a href="Naturalism%20%28literature%29">naturalistic</a>, <a href="literary%20realism">realistic</a>, <a href="Impressionism%20%28literature%29">impressionistic</a> or a mixture of the three. Told in a <a href="third-person%20narrative">third-person limited point of view</a>, the novel reflects the inner-experience of Henry Fleming, a young soldier who flees from combat, rather than upon the external world around him. "The Red Badge of Courage" is notable in its vivid descriptions and well-cadenced prose, both of which help create suspense within the story. Critics in particular have pointed to the repeated use of color imagery throughout the novel, both literal and figurative, as proof of the novel's use of Impressionism. Blue and gray uniforms are mentioned, as are yellow and orange sunlight, and green forests, while men's faces grow red with rage or courage, and gray with death. Crane also uses animalistic imagery to comment upon people, nature, and war itself. For example, the novel begins by portraying the army as a living entity that is "stretched out on the hills, resting."

While the novel takes place during a series of battles, "The Red Badge of Courage" is not a traditional Civil War narrative. Focusing on the complex internal struggle of its main character, rather than on the war itself, Crane's novel often divides readers as to whether the story is intended to be either for or against war. By avoiding political, military, and geographic details of the conflict between the states, the story becomes divorced from its historical context. Notably lacking are the dates in which the action takes place, and the name of the battle; these omissions effectively shift attention away from historical patterns in order to concentrate on the emotional violence of battle in general. The writer alluded to as much in a letter, in which he stated he wished to depict war through "a psychological portrayal of fear."

Writing more than thirty years after the novel's debut, author <a href="Joseph%20Conrad">Joseph Conrad</a> agreed that the novel's main struggle was internal rather than external, and that Fleming "stands before the unknown. He would like to prove to himself by some reasoning process that he will not 'run from the battle'. And in his unblooded regiment he can find no help. He is alone with the problem of courage." Crane's realistic portrayal of the psychological struck a chord with reviewers; as one contemporary critic wrote for "The New York Press": "At times the description is so vivid as to be almost suffocating. The reader is right down in the midst of it where patriotism is dissolved into its elements and where only a dozen men can be seen, firing blindly and grotesquely into the smoke. This is war from a new point of view."

With its heavy use of <a href="irony">irony</a>, <a href="symbol">symbol</a>ism and <a href="metaphor">metaphor</a>, the novel also lends itself to less straightforward readings. As with many of Crane's fictional works, the novel's dialogue often uses distinctive local <a href="dialect">dialect</a>s, contributing to its apparent historicity; for example, Jim Conklin muses at the beginning of the novel: "I s'pose we must go reconnoiterin' 'round th' kentry jest t' keep 'em from gittin' too clost, or t'develope'm, or something". The ironic tone increases in severity as the novel progresses, especially in terms of the ironic distance between the narrator and protagonist. The title of the work itself is ironic; Henry wishes "that he, too, had a wound, a red badge of courage", echoing a wish to have been wounded in battle. The wound he does receive (from the rifle butt of a fleeing Union soldier), however, is not a badge of courage but a badge of shame.

By substituting epithets for characters' names ("the youth", "the tattered soldier"), Crane injects an <a href="allegory">allegorical</a> quality into his work, making his characters point to a specific characteristic of man. There have been numerous interpretations concerning hidden meanings within "The Red Badge of Courage". Beginning with Robert W. Stallman's 1968 Crane biography, several critics have explored the novel in terms of Christian allegory. In particular, the death of Henry Fleming's Christ-like friend, Jim Conklin, is noted for evidence of this reading, as well as the concluding sentence of chapter nine, which refers to the sun as "fierce <a href="sacramental%20bread">wafer</a>" in the sky. John Berryman was one of the first critics to interpret the novel as a modern wasteland through which the protagonist plays the role of an <a href="Everyman">Everyman</a>. Still others read the novel as having a Naturalist structure, comparing the work to those by <a href="Theodore%20Dreiser">Theodore Dreiser</a>, <a href="Frank%20Norris">Frank Norris</a> and <a href="Jack%20London">Jack London</a>.

As the title of the work suggests, the main theme of the novel deals with Henry Fleming's attempt to prove himself a worthy soldier by earning his "red badge of courage". The first twelve chapters, until he receives his accidental wound, expose his cowardice. The following chapters detail his growth and apparently resulting heroism. Before the onset of battle, the novel's protagonist romanticized war; what little he knew about battle he learned from books: "He had read of marches, sieges, conflicts, and he had longed to see it all". Therefore, when confronted by the harsh realities of war, Henry is shocked, and his idealism falters. Finding solace in <a href="existential">existential</a> thoughts, he internally fights to make sense of the senseless world in which he finds himself. When he seems to come to terms with his situation, he is yet again forced into the fears of battle, which threaten to strip him of his enlightened identity. <a href="Joseph%20Hergesheimer">Joseph Hergesheimer</a> wrote in his introduction to the 1925 Knopf edition of the novel that, at its heart, "The Red Badge of Courage" was a "story of the birth, in a boy, of a knowledge of himself and of self-command."

However, the text is ambiguous, making it questionable that Henry ever matures. As critic Donald Gibson stated in "The Red Badge of Courage: Redefining the Hero", "the novel undercuts itself. It says there is no answer to the questions it raises; yet it says the opposite... It says that Henry Fleming finally sees things as they are; it says he is a deluded fool. It says that Henry does not see things as they are; but no one else does either." Although Crane critic and biographer Stallman wrote of Henry's "spiritual change" by the end of the story, he also found this theme difficult to champion in light of the novel's enigmatic ending. Although Henry "progresses upwards toward manhood and moral triumph", as he begins to mature by taking leave of his previous "romantic notions," "the education of the hero ends as it began: in self deception." Critic William B. Dillingham also noted the novel's heroism paradox, especially in terms of the introspective Henry's lapse into unreasoning self-abandon in the second half of the book. Dillingham stated that "in order to be courageous, a man in time of physical strife must abandon the highest of his human facilities, reason and imagination, and act instinctively, even animalistically."

The indifference of the natural world is a reoccurring theme in Crane's work. At the beginning of the novel, as the regiments advance toward battle, the sky is described as being an innocuous "fairy blue." In chapter seven, Henry notes the inexplicable tranquility of nature, "a woman with a deep aversion to tragedy", even as the battle rages on. Similarly, Heaven itself is indifferent to the slaughter he encounters on the battlefield. The dichotomy between nature's sweetness and war's destructiveness is further described in chapter eighteen: "A cloud of dark smoke as from smoldering ruins went up toward the sun now bright and gay in the blue, enameled sky." After his desertion, however, Henry finds some comfort in the laws of nature, which seem to briefly affirm his previous cowardice:

This landscape gave him assurance. A fair field holding life. It was the religion of peace. It would die if its timid eyes were compelled to see blood... He threw a pine cone at a jovial squirrel, and he ran with chattering fear. High in a treetop he stopped, and, poking his head cautiously from behind a branch, looked down with an air of trepidation. The youth felt triumphant at this exhibition. There was the law, he said. Nature had given him a sign. The squirrel, immediately upon recognizing danger, had taken to his legs without ado. He did not stand stolidly baring his furry belly to the missile, and die with an upward glance at the sympathetic heavens. On the contrary, he had fled as fast as his legs could carry him.

"The Red Badge of Courage" received generally positive reviews from critics on its initial publication; in particular, it was said to be a remarkably modern and original work. Appleton's 1895 publication went through ten editions in the first year alone, making Crane an overnight success at the age of twenty-four. <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a>, a friend of the author, later wrote that the novel was greeted by an "orgy of praise" in England and the United States. An anonymous reviewer for "The New York Press" wrote shortly after the novel's initial publication that "One should be forever slow in charging an author with genius, but it must be confessed that "The Red Badge of Courage" is open to the suspicion of having greater power and originality than can be girdled by the name of talent." The reviewer for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" was impressed by Crane's realistic portrayal of war, writing that the book "strikes the reader as a statement of facts by a veteran", a sentiment that was echoed by the reviewer for "The Critic", who called the novel "a true book; true to life, whether it be taken as a literal transcript of a soldier's experiences in his first battle, or... a great parable of the inner battle which every man must fight."

The novel, however, did have its initial detractors. Some critics found Crane's young age and inexperience troubling, rather than impressive. For example, one reviewer wrote, "As Mr. Crane is too young a man to write from experience, the frightful details of his book must be the outcome of a very feverish imagination." Crane and his work also received criticism from veterans of the war; one in particular, <a href="Alexander%20C.%20McClurg">Alexander C. McClurg</a>, a brigadier general who served through the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chickamauga">Chickamauga</a> and <a href="Chattanooga%20Campaign">Chattanooga</a> campaigns, wrote a lengthy letter to "<a href="The%20Dial">The Dial</a>" (which his publishing company owned) in April 1896, lambasting the novel as "a vicious satire upon American soldiers and American armies." Author and veteran <a href="Ambrose%20Bierce">Ambrose Bierce</a>, popular for his Civil War-fiction, also expressed contempt for the novel and its writer. When a reviewer for "The New York Journal" referred to "The Red Badge of Courage" as a poor imitation of Bierce's work, Bierce responded by congratulating them for exposing "the Crane freak". Some reviewers also found fault with Crane's narrative style, grammar mistakes, and apparent lack of traditional plot.

While it eventually became a bestseller in the United States, "The Red Badge of Courage" was more popular and sold more rapidly in England when it was published in late 1895. Crane was delighted with his novel's success overseas, writing to a friend: "I have only one pride and that is that the English edition of "The Red Badge of Courage" has been with great praise by the English reviewers. I am proud of this simply because the remoter people would seem more just and harder to win." Critic, veteran and Member of Parliament <a href="George%20Wyndham">George Wyndham</a> called the novel a "masterpiece", applauding Crane's ability to "stage the drama of man, so to speak, within the mind of one man, and then admits you as to a theatre." <a href="Harold%20Frederic">Harold Frederic</a> wrote in his own review that "If there were in existence any books of a similar character, one could start confidently by saying that it was the best of its kind. But it has no fellows. It is a book outside of all classification. So unlike anything else is it that the temptation rises to deny that it is a book at all". Frederic, who would later befriend Crane when the latter relocated to England in 1897, juxtaposed the novel's treatment of war to those by <a href="Leo%20Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a>, <a href="%C3%89mile%20Zola">Émile Zola</a> and <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a>, all of whose works he believed to be "positively... cold and ineffectual" when compared to "The Red Badge of Courage".

Crane himself later wrote about the novel: "I don't think "The Red Badge" to be any great shakes but then the very theme of it gives it an intensity that the writer can't reach every day." For the remainder of Crane's short career (he died from <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> at the age of 28) "The Red Badge of Courage" served as the standard against which the rest of his works were compared. Appleton republished the novel again in 1917, shortly after the US entered <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, reissuing it three additional times that same year.

Since the resurgence of Crane's popularity in the 1920s, "The Red Badge of Courage" has been deemed a major American text, and Crane's most important work. While modern critics have noted Crane's "anticipation of the modern spectacle of war", others, such as Crane scholar Stanley Wertheim, believe the work to be "unquestionably the most realistic novel about the American Civil War". Donald Gibson called the novel "ahead of its time" because it did "not conform to very many contemporary notions about what literature should be and do." The novel has been anthologized numerous times, including in <a href="Ernest%20Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>'s 1942 collection "". In the introduction, Hemingway wrote that the novel "is one of the finest books of our literature, and I include it entire because it is all as much of a piece as a great poem is." Robert W. Stallman's introduction to the <a href="Modern%20Library">Modern Library</a>'s 1951 edition of "The Red Badge of Courage" contained one of the first modern assessments of the novel. This novel is followed by other works by Crane, such as the short story, . 

The novel has been adapted several times for the screen. A <a href="The%20Red%20Badge%20of%20Courage%20%28film%29">1951 film by the same name</a> was directed by <a href="John%20Huston">John Huston</a>, starring <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medal of Honor</a>-recipient <a href="Audie%20Murphy">Audie Murphy</a> as Henry Fleming. Written by Huston and <a href="Albert%20Band">Albert Band</a>, the film suffered from a troubled production history, went over budget, and was cut down to only seventy minutes despite objections from the director. A made-for-television movie was released in 1974, starring <a href="Richard%20Thomas%20%28actor%29">Richard Thomas</a> as Fleming, while the 2008 Czech film "<a href="Tobruk%20%282008%20film%29">Tobruk</a>" was partly based on "The Red Badge of Courage". In 2018, a film titled "<a href="https%3A//www.imdb.com/title/tt8391372/">The Red Badge of Courage: A Soldier's Tale</a> ," was announced on IMDb as 'in development' which would be made into an epic trilogy and loosely based on the original novel.

It was formally named on 28 November 2016. The name is in line with the tradition of honoring a scientist, in this case the nuclear physicist <a href="Yuri%20Oganessian">Yuri Oganessian</a>, who has played a leading role in the discovery of the heaviest elements in the periodic table.

The <a href="radioactive%20decay">radioactive</a> oganesson atom is very unstable, and since 2005, only five (possibly six) atoms of the <a href="isotopes%20of%20oganesson">nuclide Og</a> have been detected. Although this allowed very little experimental characterization of its properties and possible <a href="Chemical%20compound">compounds</a>, theoretical calculations have resulted in many predictions, including some surprising ones. For example, although oganesson is a member of <a href="group%2018">group 18</a> – the first synthetic element to be so – it may be significantly reactive, unlike all the other elements of that group (the <a href="noble%20gases">noble gases</a>). It was formerly thought to be a gas under <a href="standard%20conditions%20for%20temperature%20and%20pressure">normal conditions</a> but is now predicted to be a <a href="solid">solid</a> due to <a href="Relativistic%20quantum%20chemistry">relativistic effects</a>. On the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a> of the elements it is a <a href="p-block">p-block</a> element and the last one of the <a href="period%207">period 7</a>.

The Danish physicist <a href="Niels%20Bohr">Niels Bohr</a> was the first to seriously consider the possibility of an element with an atomic number as high as 118, noting in 1922 that such an element would take its place in the periodic table below <a href="radon">radon</a> as the seventh noble gas. Following this, <a href="Aristid%20von%20Grosse">Aristid von Grosse</a> wrote an article in 1965 predicting the likely properties of element 118. These were remarkably early predictions, given that it was not yet known how to produce elements artificially in 1922, and that the existence of the <a href="island%20of%20stability">island of stability</a> had not yet been theorized in 1965. It was 80 years from Bohr's prediction before oganesson was successfully synthesised, although its chemical properties have not been investigated to determine if it behaves as the heavier congener of radon.

In late 1998, Polish physicist <a href="Robert%20Smola%C5%84czuk">Robert Smolańczuk</a> published calculations on the fusion of atomic nuclei towards the synthesis of <a href="superheavy%20element">superheavy atoms</a>, including oganesson. His calculations suggested that it might be possible to make oganesson by fusing <a href="lead">lead</a> with <a href="krypton">krypton</a> under carefully controlled conditions, and that the fusion probability (<a href="cross-section%20%28physics%29">cross-section</a>) of that reaction would be close to the lead–<a href="chromium">chromium</a> reaction that had produced element 106, <a href="seaborgium">seaborgium</a>. This contradicted predictions that the cross-sections for reactions with lead or <a href="bismuth">bismuth</a> targets would go down exponentially as the atomic number of the resulting elements increased.

In 1999, researchers at <a href="Lawrence%20Berkeley%20National%20Laboratory">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a> made use of these predictions and announced the discovery of <a href="livermorium">livermorium</a> and oganesson, in a paper published in "<a href="Physical%20Review%20Letters">Physical Review Letters</a>", and very soon after the results were reported in "<a href="Science%20%28journal%29">Science</a>". The researchers reported that they had performed the <a href="nuclear%20reaction">reaction</a>

The following year, they published a retraction after researchers at other laboratories were unable to duplicate the results and the Berkeley lab could not duplicate them either. In June 2002, the director of the lab announced that the original claim of the discovery of these two elements had been based on data fabricated by principal author <a href="Victor%20Ninov">Victor Ninov</a>. Newer experimental results and theoretical predictions have confirmed the exponential decrease in cross-sections with lead and bismuth targets as the atomic number of the resulting nuclide increases.

The first genuine decay of atoms of oganesson was observed in 2002 at the <a href="Joint%20Institute%20for%20Nuclear%20Research">Joint Institute for Nuclear Research</a> (JINR) in <a href="Dubna">Dubna</a>, Russia, by a joint team of Russian and American scientists. Headed by <a href="Yuri%20Oganessian">Yuri Oganessian</a>, a Russian nuclear physicist of Armenian ethnicity, the team included American scientists of the <a href="Lawrence%20Livermore%20National%20Laboratory">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a>, California. The discovery was not announced immediately, because the decay energy of Og matched that of <a href="isotopes%20of%20polonium">Po</a>, a common impurity produced in fusion reactions aimed at producing superheavy elements, and thus announcement was delayed until after a 2005 confirmatory experiment aimed at producing more oganesson atoms. On 9 October 2006, the researchers announced that they had indirectly detected a total of three (possibly four) nuclei of oganesson-294 (one or two in 2002 and two more in 2005) produced via collisions of <a href="californium">californium</a>-249 atoms and <a href="calcium-48">calcium-48</a> ions.

In 2011, <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Pure%20and%20Applied%20Chemistry">IUPAC</a> evaluated the 2006 results of the Dubna–Livermore collaboration and concluded: "The three events reported for the "Z" = 118 isotope have very good internal
redundancy but with no anchor to known nuclei do not satisfy the criteria for discovery".

Because of the very small <a href="fusion%20reaction">fusion reaction</a> probability (the fusion <a href="nuclear%20cross%20section">cross section</a> is or ) the experiment took four months and involved a beam dose of <a href="calcium">calcium</a> ions that had to be shot at the <a href="californium">californium</a> target to produce the first recorded event believed to be the synthesis of oganesson.
Nevertheless, researchers were highly confident that the results were not a <a href="false%20positive">false positive</a>, since the chance that the detections were random events was estimated to be less than one part in .

In the experiments, the alpha-decay of three atoms of oganesson was observed. A fourth decay by direct <a href="spontaneous%20fission">spontaneous fission</a> was also proposed. A <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of 0.89 ms was calculated: decays into by <a href="alpha%20decay">alpha decay</a>. Since there were only three nuclei, the half-life derived from observed lifetimes has a large uncertainty: .

The identification of the nuclei was verified by separately creating the putative <a href="decay%20product">daughter nucleus</a> directly by means of a bombardment of with ions,

and checking that the decay matched the <a href="decay%20chain">decay chain</a> of the nuclei. The daughter nucleus is very unstable, decaying with a lifetime of 14 milliseconds into , which may experience either <a href="spontaneous%20fission">spontaneous fission</a> or alpha decay into , which will undergo spontaneous fission.

In a <a href="Quantum%20tunneling">quantum-tunneling model</a>, the alpha decay half-life of was predicted to be with the experimental <a href="Q%20value%20%28nuclear%20science%29">Q-value</a> published in 2004. Calculation with theoretical Q-values from the macroscopic-microscopic model of Muntian–Hofman–Patyk–Sobiczewski gives somewhat lower but comparable results.
One atom of the heavier isotope Og may have been seen in a 2011 experiment at the <a href="GSI%20Helmholtz%20Centre%20for%20Heavy%20Ion%20Research">GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research</a> in <a href="Darmstadt">Darmstadt</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a> aimed at the synthesis of <a href="unbinilium">element 120</a> in the reaction Cm+Cr, but uncertainties in the data meant that the observed chain cannot be definitely assigned to 120 and Og: the data indicates a longer half-life of Og of 181 milliseconds than that of Og, which is 0.7 milliseconds.

In December 2015, the <a href="IUPAC/IUPAP%20Joint%20Working%20Party">Joint Working Party</a> of international scientific bodies <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Pure%20and%20Applied%20Chemistry">International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry</a> (IUPAC) and <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Pure%20and%20Applied%20Physics">International Union of Pure and Applied Physics</a> (IUPAP) recognized the element's discovery and assigned the priority of the discovery to the Dubna–Livermore collaboration. This was on account of two 2009 and 2010 confirmations of the properties of the granddaughter of Og, Fl, at the <a href="Lawrence%20Berkeley%20National%20Laboratory">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>, as well as the observation of another consistent decay chain of Og by the Dubna group in 2012. The goal of that experiment had been the synthesis of Ts via the reaction Bk(Ca,3n), but the short half-life of Bk resulted in a significant quantity of the target having decayed to Cf, resulting in the synthesis of oganesson instead of <a href="tennessine">tennessine</a>.

From 1 October 2015 to 6 April 2016, the Dubna team performed a similar experiment with Ca projectiles aimed at a mixed-isotope californium target containing Cf, Cf, and Cf, with the aim of producing the heavier oganesson isotopes Og and Og. Two beam energies at 252 MeV and 258 MeV were used. Only one atom was seen at the lower beam energy, whose decay chain fitted the previously known one of Og (terminating with spontaneous fission of Fl), and none were seen at the higher beam energy. The experiment was then halted, as the glue from the sector frames covered the target and blocked evaporation residues from escaping to the detectors. The Dubna team planned to repeat this experiment in 2017.

Using <a href="Mendeleev%27s%20predicted%20elements">Mendeleev's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements</a>, oganesson is sometimes known as "eka-radon" (until the 1960s as "eka-emanation", emanation being the old name for <a href="radon">radon</a>). In 1979, IUPAC assigned the <a href="systematic%20element%20name">systematic</a> <a href="placeholder%20name">placeholder name</a> "ununoctium" to the undiscovered element, with the corresponding symbol of "Uuo", and recommended that it be used until after confirmed discovery of the element. Although widely used in the chemical community on all levels, from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks, the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field, who called it "element 118", with the symbol of "E118", "(118)", or even simply "118".

Before the retraction in 2001, the researchers from Berkeley had intended to name the element "ghiorsium" ("Gh"), after <a href="Albert%20Ghiorso">Albert Ghiorso</a> (a leading member of the research team).

The Russian discoverers reported their synthesis in 2006. According to IUPAC recommendations, the discoverers of a new element have the right to suggest a name. In 2007, the head of the Russian institute stated the team were considering two names for the new element: "flyorium", in honor of <a href="Georgy%20Flyorov">Georgy Flyorov</a>, the founder of the research laboratory in Dubna; and "moskovium", in recognition of the <a href="Moscow%20Oblast">Moscow Oblast</a> where Dubna is located. He also stated that although the element was discovered as an American collaboration, who provided the californium target, the element should rightly be named in honor of Russia since the <a href="Flyorov%20Laboratory%20of%20Nuclear%20Reactions">Flyorov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions</a> at JINR was the only facility in the world which could achieve this result. These names were later proposed for <a href="flerovium">element 114</a> (flerovium) and <a href="livermorium">element 116</a> (moscovium). However, the final name proposed for element 116 was instead "livermorium", and the name "moscovium" was later proposed and accepted for <a href="moscovium">element 115</a> instead.

Traditionally, the names of all <a href="noble%20gas">noble gas</a>es end in "-on", with the exception of <a href="helium">helium</a>, which was not known to be a noble gas when discovered. The IUPAC guidelines valid at the moment of the discovery approval however required "all" new elements be named with the ending "-ium", even if they turned out to be <a href="halogen">halogen</a>s (traditionally ending in "-ine") or noble gases (traditionally ending in "-on"). While the provisional name ununoctium followed this convention, a new IUPAC recommendation published in 2016 recommended using the "-on" ending for new <a href="group%2018%20element">group 18 element</a>s, regardless of whether they turn out to have the chemical properties of a noble gas.

In June 2016 IUPAC announced that the discoverers planned to give the element the name "oganesson" (symbol: "Og"), in honour of the Russian nuclear physicist <a href="Yuri%20Oganessian">Yuri Oganessian</a>, a pioneer in superheavy element research for sixty years reaching back to the field's foundation: his team and his proposed techniques had led directly to the synthesis of elements <a href="seaborgium">106</a> through 118. The name became official on 28 November 2016. Oganessian later commented on the naming:

The naming ceremony for moscovium, tennessine, and oganesson was held on 2 March 2017 at the <a href="Russian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Russian Academy of Sciences</a> in <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a>.

The stability of nuclei quickly decreases with the increase in atomic number after <a href="curium">curium</a>, element 96, whose half-life is four orders of magnitude longer than that of any subsequent element. All isotopes with an atomic number above <a href="mendelevium">101</a> undergo radioactive decay with half-lives of less than 30 hours. No elements with atomic numbers above 82 (after <a href="lead">lead</a>) have stable isotopes. This is because of the ever-increasing Coulomb repulsion of protons, so that the <a href="strong%20nuclear%20force">strong nuclear force</a> cannot hold the nucleus together against <a href="spontaneous%20fission">spontaneous fission</a> for long. Calculations suggest that in the absence of other stabilizing factors, elements with more than <a href="rutherfordium">104 protons</a> should not exist. However, researchers in the 1960s suggested that the closed <a href="nuclear%20shell%20model">nuclear shells</a> around 114 protons and 184 neutrons should counteract this instability, creating an "<a href="island%20of%20stability">island of stability</a>" where nuclides could have half-lives reaching thousands or millions of years. While scientists have still not reached the island, the mere existence of the <a href="superheavy%20element">superheavy element</a>s (including oganesson) confirms that this stabilizing effect is real, and in general the known superheavy nuclides become exponentially longer-lived as they approach the predicted location of the island. Oganesson is <a href="radioactive">radioactive</a> and has a <a href="half-life">half-life</a> that appears to be less than a <a href="millisecond">millisecond</a>. Nonetheless, this is still longer than some predicted values, thus giving further support to the idea of this "island of stability".

Calculations using a quantum-tunneling model predict the existence of several neutron-rich isotopes of oganesson with alpha-decay half-lives close to 1 ms.

Theoretical calculations done on the synthetic pathways for, and the half-life of, other <a href="isotopes%20of%20oganesson">isotopes</a> have shown that some could be slightly more <a href="stable%20isotope">stable</a> than the synthesized isotope Og, most likely Og, Og, Og, Og, Og, Og and Og. Of these, Og might provide the best chances for obtaining longer-lived nuclei, and thus might become the focus of future work with this element. Some isotopes with many more neutrons, such as some located around Og, could also provide longer-lived nuclei. Since these heavier isotopes greatly facilitate future chemical studies of oganesson, due to their expected longer half-lives, the Dubna team plans to conduct an experiment through the second half of 2017 with a heavier target containing a mix of the isotopes Cf, Cf, and Cf with Ca projectiles, aimed at the synthesis of the new isotopes Og and Og; a repeat of this reaction in 2020 at the JINR is planned to produce Og. The production of Og and its daughter Lv in this reaction is also possible. The isotopes Og and Og may also be produced in the fusion of Cm with Ti projectiles, a reaction planned at the JINR and at <a href="RIKEN">RIKEN</a> in 2017–2018.

Oganesson is a member of <a href="noble%20gas">group 18</a>, the zero-<a href="valency%20%28chemistry%29">valence</a> elements. The members of this group are usually inert to most common chemical reactions (for example, combustion) because the outer <a href="valence%20shell">valence shell</a> is completely filled with <a href="octet%20rule">eight electrons</a>. This produces a stable, minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound. It is thought that similarly, oganesson has a <a href="closed%20shell">closed</a> outer valence shell in which its <a href="valence%20electron">valence electron</a>s are arranged in a 7s7p <a href="electron%20configuration">configuration</a>.

Consequently, some expect oganesson to have similar physical and chemical properties to other members of its group, most closely resembling the noble gas above it in the periodic table, <a href="radon">radon</a>.
Following the <a href="periodic%20trend">periodic trend</a>, oganesson would be expected to be slightly more reactive than radon. However, theoretical calculations have shown that it could be significantly more reactive. In addition to being far more reactive than radon, oganesson may be even more reactive than the elements <a href="flerovium">flerovium</a> and <a href="copernicium">copernicium</a>, which are heavier homologs of the more chemically active elements <a href="lead">lead</a> and <a href="mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a> respectively. The reason for the possible enhancement of the chemical activity of oganesson relative to radon is an energetic destabilization and a radial expansion of the last occupied 7p-<a href="Electron%20shell%23Subshells">subshell</a>. More precisely, considerable <a href="spin%E2%80%93orbit%20interaction">spin–orbit interaction</a>s between the 7p electrons and the inert 7s electrons effectively lead to a second valence shell closing at <a href="flerovium">flerovium</a>, and a significant decrease in stabilization of the closed shell of oganesson. It has also been calculated that oganesson, unlike the other noble gases, binds an electron with release of energy, or in other words, it exhibits positive <a href="electron%20affinity">electron affinity</a>, due to the relativistically stabilized 8s energy level and the destabilized 7p level, whereas copernicium and flerovium are predicted to have no electron affinity. Nevertheless, <a href="quantum%20electrodynamic">quantum electrodynamic</a> corrections have been shown to be quite significant in reducing this affinity by decreasing the binding in the <a href="anion">anion</a> Og by 9%, thus confirming the importance of these corrections in <a href="superheavy%20element">superheavy element</a>s.

Oganesson is expected to have an extremely broad <a href="polarizability">polarizability</a>, almost double that of radon. By extrapolating from the other noble gases, it is expected that oganesson has a boiling point between 320 and 380 K. This is very different from the previously estimated values of 263 K or 247 K. Even given the large uncertainties of the calculations, it seems highly unlikely that oganesson would be a gas under <a href="standard%20conditions">standard conditions</a>, and as the liquid range of the other gases is very narrow, between 2 and 9 kelvins, this element should be <a href="solid">solid</a> at standard conditions. If oganesson forms a <a href="gas">gas</a> under standard conditions nevertheless, it would be one of the densest gaseous substances at standard conditions, even if it is <a href="monatomic">monatomic</a> like the other noble gases.

Because of its tremendous polarizability, oganesson is expected to have an anomalously low <a href="ionization%20energy">ionization energy</a> (similar to that of <a href="lead">lead</a> which is 70% of that of radon and significantly smaller than that of flerovium) and a standard state <a href="condensed%20phase">condensed phase</a>. Even the shell structure in the nucleus and electron cloud of oganesson is strongly impacted by relativistic effects: the valence and core electron subshells in oganesson are expected to be "smeared out" in a homogeneous <a href="Fermi%20gas">Fermi gas</a> of electrons, unlike those of the "less relativistic" radon and xenon (although there is some incipient delocalisation in radon), due to the very strong spin-orbit splitting of the 7p orbital in oganesson. A similar effect for nucleons, particularly neutrons, is incipient in the closed-neutron-shell nucleus Og and is strongly in force at the hypothetical superheavy closed-shell nucleus 164, with 164 protons and 308 neutrons.

The only confirmed isotope of oganesson, Og, has much too short a half-life to be chemically investigated experimentally. Therefore, no compounds of oganesson have been synthesized yet. Nevertheless, calculations on <a href="theoretical%20chemistry">theoretical compounds</a> have been performed since 1964. It is expected that if the <a href="ionization%20energy">ionization energy</a> of the element is high enough, it will be difficult to <a href="oxidize">oxidize</a> and therefore, the most common <a href="oxidation%20state">oxidation state</a> would be 0 (as for the noble gases); nevertheless, this appears not to be the case.

Calculations on the <a href="diatomic%20molecule">diatomic molecule</a> showed a <a href="chemical%20bond">bonding</a> interaction roughly equivalent to that calculated for , and a <a href="dissociation%20energy">dissociation energy</a> of 6 kJ/mol, roughly 4 times of that of . Most strikingly, it was calculated to have a <a href="bond%20length">bond length</a> shorter than in by 0.16 Å, which would be indicative of a significant bonding interaction. On the other hand, the compound OgH exhibits a dissociation energy (in other words <a href="proton%20affinity">proton affinity</a> of oganesson) that is smaller than that of RnH.

The bonding between oganesson and <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> in OgH is predicted to be very weak and can be regarded as a pure <a href="van%20der%20Waals%20interaction">van der Waals interaction</a> rather than a true <a href="chemical%20bond">chemical bond</a>. On the other hand, with highly electronegative elements, oganesson seems to form more stable compounds than for example <a href="copernicium">copernicium</a> or <a href="flerovium">flerovium</a>. The stable oxidation states +2 and +4 have been predicted to exist in the <a href="fluoride">fluoride</a>s and . The +6 state would be less stable due to the strong binding of the 7p subshell. This is a result of the same spin-orbit interactions that make oganesson unusually reactive. For example, it was shown that the reaction of oganesson with to form the compound would release an energy of 106 kcal/mol of which about 46 kcal/mol come from these interactions. For comparison, the spin-orbit interaction for the similar molecule is about 10 kcal/mol out of a formation energy of 49 kcal/mol. The same interaction stabilizes the <a href="tetrahedral%20molecular%20geometry">tetrahedral T configuration</a> for , as distinct from the <a href="square%20planar">square planar D one</a> of <a href="xenon%20tetrafluoride"></a>, which is also expected to have. The Og–F bond will most probably be <a href="ionic%20bond">ionic</a> rather than <a href="covalent%20bond">covalent</a>, rendering the oganesson fluorides non-volatile. OgF is predicted to be partially <a href="ionic%20bonding">ionic</a> due to oganesson's high <a href="electropositivity">electropositivity</a>. Unlike the other noble gases (except possibly <a href="xenon">xenon</a> and radon), oganesson is predicted to be sufficiently electropositive to form an Og–Cl bond with <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a>.

Secretariat (horse)

Secretariat (March 30, 1970 – October 4, 1989) was an American <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a> <a href="racehorse">racehorse</a> who, in 1973, became the first <a href="United%20States%20Triple%20Crown%20of%20Thoroughbred%20Racing">Triple Crown</a> winner in 25 years. His record-breaking victory in the <a href="Belmont%20Stakes">Belmont Stakes</a>, which he won by 31 <a href="Horse%20length">lengths</a>, is widely regarded as one of the greatest races of all time. During his racing career, he won five <a href="Eclipse%20Awards">Eclipse Awards</a>, including <a href="American%20Horse%20of%20the%20Year">Horse of the Year</a> honors at ages two and three. He was elected to the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Racing%20and%20Hall%20of%20Fame">National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame</a> in 1974. In the <a href="Blood-Horse%20magazine%20List%20of%20the%20Top%20100%20U.S.%20Racehorses%20of%20the%2020th%20Century">List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century</a>, Secretariat is second only to <a href="Man%20o%27%20War">Man o' War</a> (racing career 1919–1920), who also was a large <a href="Chestnut%20%28coat%29">chestnut</a> <a href="Colt%20%28horse%29">colt</a> given the nickname "Big Red".

At age two, Secretariat finished fourth in his 1972 debut in a <a href="Glossary%20of%20North%20American%20horse%20racing%23M">maiden</a> race, but then won seven of his remaining eight starts, including five stakes victories. His only loss during this period was in the <a href="Champagne%20Stakes%20%28United%20States%29">Champagne Stakes</a>, where he finished first but was disqualified to second for interference. He received the <a href="Eclipse%20Award">Eclipse Award</a> for <a href="American%20Champion%20Two-Year-Old%20Colt">champion two-year-old colt</a>, and also was the 1972 Horse of the Year, a rare honor for a horse so young. At age three, Secretariat not only won the Triple Crown, he set speed records in all three races. His time in the <a href="Kentucky%20Derby">Kentucky Derby</a> still stands as the <a href="Churchill%20Downs">Churchill Downs</a> track record for miles, and his time in the Belmont Stakes stands as the American record for miles on the dirt. His controversial time in the <a href="Preakness%20Stakes">Preakness Stakes</a> was eventually recognized as a stakes record in 2012. Secretariat's win in the <a href="Gotham%20Stakes">Gotham Stakes</a> tied the track record for 1 mile, he set a world record in the <a href="Marlboro%20Cup">Marlboro Cup</a> at miles, and further proved his versatility by winning two major stakes races on <a href="Poaceae%23Sports%20turf">turf</a>. He lost three times that year: in the <a href="Wood%20Memorial">Wood Memorial</a>, <a href="Whitney%20Handicap">Whitney</a>, and <a href="Woodward%20Stakes">Woodward Stakes</a>, but the brilliance of his nine wins made him an American icon. He won his second Horse of the Year title, plus Eclipse Awards for <a href="Eclipse%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Three-Year-Old%20Colt">champion three-year-old colt</a> and <a href="American%20Champion%20Turf%20Horse">champion turf horse</a>.

At the beginning of his three-year-old year, Secretariat was <a href="Syndicate%23Business%20syndicates">syndicated</a> for a record-breaking $6.08 million on condition that he be retired from racing by the end of the year. Although he sired several successful racehorses, he ultimately was most influential through his daughters' offspring, becoming the <a href="leading%20broodmare%20sire%20in%20North%20America">leading broodmare sire in North America</a> in 1992. His daughters produced several notable <a href="Glossary%20of%20equestrian%20terms%23S">sires</a>, including <a href="Storm%20Cat">Storm Cat</a>, <a href="A.P.%20Indy">A.P. Indy</a>, <a href="Gone%20West">Gone West</a>, <a href="Dehere">Dehere</a> and <a href="Chief%27s%20Crown">Chief's Crown</a>, and through them Secretariat appears in the pedigree of many modern champions. Secretariat died in 1989 due to <a href="laminitis">laminitis</a> at age 19. He is recognized as one of the greatest horses in American racing history.

Secretariat was officially bred by <a href="Christopher%20Chenery">Christopher Chenery's</a> Meadow Stud, but the breeding was actually arranged by <a href="Penny%20Chenery">Penny Chenery</a> (then known as Penny Tweedy), who had taken over the running of the stable in 1968 when her father became ill. Secretariat was sired by <a href="Bold%20Ruler">Bold Ruler</a> and his dam was <a href="Somethingroyal">Somethingroyal</a>, a daughter of <a href="Princequillo">Princequillo</a>. Bold Ruler was the <a href="leading%20sire%20in%20North%20America">leading sire in North America</a> from 1963 to 1969 and again in 1973. Owned by the <a href="Phipps%20family">Phipps family</a>, Bold Ruler possessed both speed and stamina, having won the <a href="Preakness%20Stakes">Preakness Stakes</a> and Horse of the Year honors in 1957, and <a href="American%20Champion%20Sprint%20Horse">American Champion Sprint Horse</a> honors in 1958. Bold Ruler was retired to <a href="Stud%20%28horse%29">stud</a> at <a href="Claiborne%20Farm">Claiborne Farm</a>, but the Phippses owned most of the <a href="mare">mare</a>s to which Bold Ruler was bred, and few of his offspring were sold at public auction. To bring new blood into their breeding program, the Phippses sometimes negotiated a foal-sharing agreement with other mare owners: Instead of charging a <a href="stud%20fee">stud fee</a> for Bold Ruler, they would arrange for multiple matings with Bold Ruler, either with two mares in one year or one mare over a two-year period. Assuming two foals were produced, the Phipps family would keep one and the mare's owner would keep the other, with a <a href="coin%20toss">coin toss</a> determining who received first pick.

Under such an arrangement, Chenery sent two mares to be bred to Bold Ruler in 1968, Hasty Matelda and Somethingroyal. She then sent <a href="Cicada%20%28horse%29">Cicada</a> and Somethingroyal in 1969. The foal-sharing agreement stated that the winner of the coin toss would get first pick of the foals produced in 1969, while the loser of the toss would get first pick of the foals due in 1970. In the spring of 1969, a <a href="colt%20%28horse%29">colt</a> and <a href="filly">filly</a> were produced. In the 1969 breeding season, Cicada did not conceive, leaving only one foal due in the spring of 1970. Thus, the winner of the coin toss would get only one foal (the first pick from 1969), and the loser would get two (the second pick from 1969 and the only foal from 1970). Chenery later said that both owners hoped they would lose the coin toss, which was held in the fall of 1969 in the office of <a href="New%20York%20Racing%20Association">New York Racing Association</a> Chairman <a href="Alfred%20G.%20Vanderbilt%20II">Alfred G. Vanderbilt II</a>, with <a href="Arthur%20B.%20Hancock%2C%20Jr.">Arthur "Bull" Hancock</a> of Claiborne Farm as witness. <a href="Ogden%20Phipps">Ogden Phipps</a> won the toss and took the 1969 <a href="weanling">weanling</a> filly out of Somethingroyal. The filly was named The Bride and never won a race, though she did later become a stakes producer. Chenery received the Hasty Matelda colt in 1969 and the as-yet-unborn 1970 foal of Somethingroyal, which turned out to be Secretariat.

On March 30, 1970, at 12:10 a.m. at the Meadow Stud in <a href="Caroline%20County%2C%20Virginia">Caroline County, Virginia</a>, Somethingroyal foaled a bright-red chestnut colt with three white <a href="Horse%20markings%23Leg%20markings">socks</a> and a <a href="Horse%20markings%23Facial%20markings">star with a narrow stripe</a>. The foal stood when he was 45 minutes old and nursed 30 minutes later. Howard Gentry, the manager of Meadow Stud, was at the foaling and later said, "He was a very well-made foal. He was as perfect a foal that I ever delivered." The colt soon distinguished himself from the others. "He was always the leader in the crowd," said Gentry's nephew, Robert, who also worked at the farm. "To us, he was Big Red, and he had a personality. He was a clown and was always cutting up, always into some devilment." Some time later, Chenery got her first look at the foal and made a one word entry in her notebook: "Wow!"

That fall, Chenery and Elizabeth Ham, the Meadow's longtime secretary, worked together to name the newly weaned colt. The first set of names submitted to the Jockey Club (Sceptre, Royal Line, and Something Special) played on the names of his sire and dam, but were rejected. The second set, submitted in January 1971, were Games of Chance, Deo Volente ("God Willing"), and Secretariat, the last suggested by Ham based on her previous job associated with the <a href="United%20Nations%20Secretariat">secretariat</a> of the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a> (the predecessor of the United Nations).

Secretariat grew into a massive, powerful horse said to resemble his sire's maternal grandsire, <a href="Discovery%20%28horse%29">Discovery</a>. He stood when fully grown. He was noted for being exceptionally well-balanced, a big, powerful horse described as having "nearly perfect" <a href="equine%20conformation">conformation</a> and stride <a href="Sports%20biomechanics">biomechanics</a>. His <a href="Equine%20conformation%23The%20Chest">chest</a> was so large that he required a custom-made <a href="girth%20%28tack%29">girth</a>, and he was noted for his large, powerful, well-muscled hindquarters. An Australian trainer said of him, "He is incredible, an absolutely perfect horse. I never saw anything like him."

Secretariat's absence of major conformation flaws was important, as horses with well made <a href="limbs%20of%20the%20horse">limbs</a> and feet are less likely to become injured. Secretariat's hindquarters were the main source of his power, with a sloped <a href="Rump%20%28animal%29">croup</a> that extended the length of his femur. When in full stride, his hind legs were able to reach far under himself, increasing his drive. His ample girth, long back and well-made neck all contributed to his heart-lung efficiency.

The manner in which Secretariat's body parts fit together determined the efficiency of his stride, which affected his acceleration and endurance. Even very small differences in the length and angles of bones can have a major effect on performance. Secretariat was well put together even as a two-year-old, and by the time he was three, he had further matured in body and smoothed out his gait. The New York Racing Association's Dr. M. A. Gilman, a veterinarian who routinely measured leading Thoroughbreds with a goal of applying science to create better ways to breed and evaluate racehorses, measured Secretariat's development from two to three as follows:

Secretariat's length of stride was considered large even after taking into account his large frame and strong build. While training for the Preakness Stakes, his stride was measured as 24 feet, 11 inches. His powerful hindquarters allowed him to unleash "devastating" speed and because he was so well-muscled and had significant cardiac capacity, he could simply out-gallop competitors at nearly any point in a race.

His weight before the Gotham Stakes in April 1973 was . After completing the grueling Triple Crown, his weight on June 15 had dropped only 24 pounds, to . Secretariat was known for his appetite—during his three-year-old campaign, he ate 15 quarts of oats a day—and to keep the muscle from turning to fat, he needed fast workouts that could have won many a stakes race.

<a href="Seth%20Hancock">Seth Hancock</a> of Claiborne Farm once said, 

Secretariat raced in Meadow Stables' blue-and-white-checkered colors. He never raced in <a href="leg%20wraps">track bandages</a>, but typically wore a <a href="blinders">blinker hood</a>, mostly to help him focus, but also because he had a tendency to run in towards the rail during races. In January 1972, he joined trainer <a href="Lucien%20Laurin">Lucien Laurin</a>'s winter stable at <a href="Hialeah%20Park%20Race%20Track">Hialeah</a>. Secretariat gained a reputation as a kind horse, likeable and unruffled in crowds or by the bumping that occurs between young horses. He had the physique of a runner, but at first was awkward and clumsy. He was frequently outpaced by more precocious stable mates, running a quarter-mile in 26 seconds compared to 23 seconds by his peers. His regular exercise riders were Jim Gaffney and Charlie Davis. Davis was not initially impressed. "He was a big fat sucker", Davis said. "I mean, he was big. He wasn't in a hurry to do nothin'. He took his time. The quality was there, but he didn't show it until he wanted to." Gaffney though recalled his first ride on Secretariat in early 1972 as "having this big red machine under me, and from that very first day I knew he had a power of strength that I have never felt before ..."

Groom <a href="Eddie%20Sweat">Eddie Sweat</a> was another important member of the Secretariat team, providing most of the daily hands-on care. Sweat once told a reporter, "I guess a groom gets closer to a horse than anyone. The owner, the trainer, they maybe see him once a day. But I lived with him, worked with him."

Laurin sent Chenery regular updates on Secretariat's progress, saying that the colt was still learning to run, or that he still needed to lose his baby fat. Chenery recalled that when Secretariat was in training, Lucien once said: "Your big Bold Ruler colt don't show me nothin'. He can't outrun a fat man." But Secretariat made steady progress over the spring. On June 6, he wore blinkers for the first time to keep his attention focused and responded with a half-mile workout in a solid 47 seconds. On June 24, he ran a "bullet", the fastest workout of the day, at 6 furlongs in 1:12 on a sloppy track. Laurin called Chenery at her Colorado home and advised her that Secretariat was ready to race.

For his first start on July 4, 1972 at <a href="Aqueduct%20Racetrack">Aqueduct Racetrack</a>, Secretariat was made the lukewarm favorite at 3–1. At the start, a horse named Quebec cut in front of the field, causing a chain reaction that resulted in Secretariat being bumped hard. According to jockey Paul Feliciano, he would have fallen if he hadn't been so strong. Secretariat recovered, only to run into traffic on the backstretch. In tenth position at the top of the stretch, he closed ground rapidly and finished fourth, beaten by only <a href="horse%20length">lengths</a>. In many of his subsequent races, Secretariat hung back at the start, which Laurin later attributed to the bumping he received in his debut.

With Feliciano again up, Secretariat returned to the track on July 15 as the 6–5 favorite. He broke poorly, but then rushed past the field on the turn to win by six lengths. On July 31 in an allowance race at <a href="Saratoga%20Race%20Course">Saratoga</a>, Feliciano was replaced by <a href="Ron%20Turcotte">Ron Turcotte</a>, the regular jockey for Meadow Stables. Turcotte had ridden the colt in several morning workouts, but had missed his first two starts while recovering from a fall. Secretariat's commanding win as the 2–5 favorite caught the attention of veteran sportswriter, <a href="Charles%20Hatton">Charles Hatton</a>. He later reported, "You carry an ideal around in your head, and boy, I thought, 'This is it.' I never saw perfection before. I absolutely could not fault him in any way. And neither could the rest of them and that was the amazing thing about it. The body and the head and the eye and the general attitude. It was just incredible. I couldn't believe my eyes, frankly."

In August, Secretariat entered the <a href="Sanford%20Stakes">Sanford Stakes</a>, facing off with highly regarded Linda's Chief. Entering the stretch, Secretariat was blocked by the horses in front of him but then made his way through "like a hawk scattering a barnyard of chickens" on his way to a three-length win. Sportswriter <a href="Andrew%20Beyer">Andrew Beyer</a> covered the race for the "<a href="Washington%20Star">Washington Star</a>" and later wrote, "Never have I watched a lightly raced 2-year-old stamp himself so definitively as a potential great."

Ten days later in the <a href="Hopeful%20Stakes">Hopeful Stakes</a>, Secretariat made a "dazzling" move, passing eight horses within mile to take the lead then drawing off to win by five lengths. His time of 1:16 for furlongs was only of a second off the track record. Returning to Belmont Park on September 16, he won the <a href="Belmont%20Futurity">Belmont Futurity</a> by a length and a half after starting his move on the turn. He then ran in the <a href="Champagne%20Stakes%20%28United%20States%29">Champagne Stakes</a> at Belmont on October 14 as the 7–10 favorite. As had become his custom, he started slowly and then made a big move around the turn, blowing past his rivals to win by two lengths. However, following an inquiry by the racecourse stewards, Secretariat was disqualified and placed second for bearing in and interfering with <a href="Stop%20The%20Music%20%28horse%29">Stop the Music</a>, who was declared the winner.

Secretariat then took the <a href="Laurel%20Futurity">Laurel Futurity</a> on October 28, winning by eight lengths over Stop the Music. His time on a sloppy track was just of a second off the track record. He completed his season in the <a href="Garden%20State%20Futurity">Garden State Futurity</a> on November 18, dropping back early and making a powerful move around the turn to win by lengths at 1–10 odds. Laurin said, "In all his races, he has taken the worst of it by coming from behind, usually circling his field. A colt has to be a real runner to do this consistently and get away with it."

Secretariat won the <a href="Eclipse%20Award">Eclipse Award</a> for <a href="American%20Champion%20Two-Year-Old%20Male%20Horse">American Champion Two-Year-Old Male Horse</a> and, in a rare occurrence, two two-year-olds topped the balloting for 1972 <a href="American%20Horse%20of%20the%20Year">American Horse of the Year</a> honors, with Secretariat edging out the undefeated filly, <a href="La%20Prevoyante">La Prevoyante</a>. Secretariat received the votes of the <a href="Thoroughbred%20Racing%20Associations%20of%20North%20America">Thoroughbred Racing Associations of North America</a> and the <a href="Daily%20Racing%20Form">Daily Racing Form</a>, while La Prevoyante was chosen by the <a href="National%20Turf%20Writers%20Association">National Turf Writers Association</a>. Only one horse since then, <a href="Favorite%20Trick">Favorite Trick</a> in 1997, has won that award as a two-year-old.

In January 1973, Christopher Chenery, the founder of Meadow Stables, died and the taxes on his estate forced his daughter Penny to consider selling Secretariat. Together with Seth Hancock of Claiborne Farm, she instead managed to <a href="syndicate">syndicate</a> the horse, selling 32 shares worth $190,000 each for a total of $6.08 million, a world syndication record at the time, surpassing the previous record for <a href="Nijinsky%20%28horse%29">Nijinsky</a> who was syndicated for $5.44 million in 1970. Hancock said the sale was easy, citing Secretariat's two-year-old performance, breeding, and appearance. "He's, well, he's a hell of a horse." Chenery retained four shares in the horse and would have complete control over his three-year-old racing campaign, but agreed that he would be retired at the end of the year.

Secretariat wintered in Florida but did not race until March 17, 1973 in the <a href="Bay%20Shore%20Stakes">Bay Shore Stakes</a> at Aqueduct, where he went off as the heavy favorite. As the trainer of one of his opponents put it, "The only chance we have is if he falls down." Racing boxed in by horses on each side, Turcotte decided to go through a narrow gap between horses rather than try to circle the field. Secretariat broke free and won easily, but one of the other jockeys claimed that Secretariat had committed a foul going through the hole. The stewards reviewed photos from the race and determined that Secretariat was actually on the receiving end of a bump, so let the result stand. The Bay Shore established that Secretariat had improved over the winter and that he could also handle adversity.
In the <a href="Gotham%20Stakes">Gotham Stakes</a> on April 7, Laurin decided to experiment with Secretariat's running style. With no speed horses entered in the race, Secretariat would be allowed to set his own pace. Accordingly, Turcotte hustled Secretariat from the <a href="starting%20gate">starting gate</a> and they led easily. Down the stretch though, Champagne Charlie came running and at the <a href="Glossary%20of%20North%20American%20horse%20racing%23E">eighth pole</a> was almost even. Turcotte tapped Secretariat once on each side with the whip and Secretariat drew away to win by three lengths. He ran the first 3/4 mile in 1:08 and finished the one-mile race in 1:33, matching the track record.

His final preparatory race for the Kentucky Derby was the <a href="Wood%20Memorial">Wood Memorial</a>, where he finished a surprising third to <a href="Angle%20Light">Angle Light</a> and <a href="Santa%20Anita%20Derby">Santa Anita Derby</a> winner <a href="Sham%20%28horse%29">Sham</a>. Laurin was crushed, even though he had trained the winner, Angle Light, who set a slow pace and "stole" the race. Secretariat's loss was later attributed to a large abscess in his mouth, which made him sensitive to the bit. Before and after the race, there was some ill feeling between Laurin and the trainer of Sham, <a href="Pancho%20Martin">Pancho Martin</a>, fanned by comments in the press. The dispute concerned the use of coupled entries as Martin had entered two horses in addition to Sham, all with the same owner. There was fear that an entry could be used tactically to gang up on another horse. Stung by such insinuations, Martin wound up scratching the two horses that he had originally entered with Sham, and asked Lauren to do the same, but Laurin could not follow suit as Secretariat and Angle Light had different owners.

Because of the Wood Memorial results, Secretariat's chances in the Kentucky Derby became the subject of much speculation in the media. Some questioned his stamina: in part because of his "blocky" build, more typical of a sprinter, and in part because of Bold Ruler's reputation as a sire of precocious sprinters. Rumors circulated that Secretariat was unsound.

The <a href="1973%20Kentucky%20Derby">1973 Kentucky Derby</a> on May 5 attracted a crowd of 134,476 to <a href="Churchill%20Downs">Churchill Downs</a>, then the largest crowd in North American racing history. The bettors made the entry of Secretariat and Angle Light the 3–2 favorite, with Sham the second choice at 5–2. The start was marred when Twice a Prince reared in his stall, hitting Our Native, positioned next to him, and causing Sham to bang his head against the gate, loosening two teeth. Sham then broke poorly and cut himself, also bumping into Navajo. Secretariat avoided problems by breaking last from <a href="Glossary%20of%20North%20American%20horse%20racing%23P">post position</a> 10, then cut over to the rail. Early leader Shecky Greene set a reasonable pace, then gave way to Sham around the far turn. Secretariat came charging as they entered the stretch and battled with Sham down the stretch, finally pulling away to win by lengths. Our Native finished eight lengths further back in third.

On his way to a still-standing track record of 1:59, Secretariat ran each quarter-mile segment faster than the one before it. The successive quarter-mile times were :25, :24, :23, :23, and :23. This means he was still accelerating as of the final quarter-mile of the race. No other horse had won the Derby in less than 2 minutes before, and it would not be accomplished again until <a href="Monarchos">Monarchos</a> ran the race in 1:59.97 in 2001.

Sportswriter Mike Sullivan later said:

In the <a href="1973%20Preakness%20Stakes">1973 Preakness Stakes</a> on May 19, Secretariat broke last, but then made a huge, last-to-first move on the first turn. Raymond Woolfe, a photographer for the "Daily Racing Form", captured Secretariat launching the move with a leaping stride in the air. This was later used as the basis for the statue by <a href="John%20Skeaping">John Skeaping</a> that stands in the Belmont Park paddock. Turcotte later said that he was proudest of this win because of the split-second decision he made going into the turn: "I let my horse drop back, when I went to drop in, they started backing up into me. I said, 'I don't want to get trapped here.' So I just breezed by them." Secretariat completed the second quarter mile of the race in under 22 seconds. After reaching the lead with furlongs to go, Secretariat was never challenged, and won by lengths, with Sham again finishing second and Our Native in third, a further eight lengths back. It was the first time in history that the top three finishers in the Derby and Preakness were the same; the distance between each of the horses was also the same.

The time of the race was disputed. The infield teletimer displayed a time of 1:55 but it had malfunctioned because of damage caused by people crossing the track to reach the infield. The <a href="Pimlico%20Race%20Course">Pimlico Race Course</a> clocker E.T. McLean Jr. announced a hand time of 1:54, but two "Daily Racing Form" clockers claimed the time was 1:53, which would have broken the track record of 1:54 set by <a href="Ca%C3%B1onero%20II">Cañonero II</a>. Tapes of Secretariat and Cañonero II were played side by side by CBS, and Secretariat got to the finish line first on tape, though this was not a reliable method of timing a horse race at the time. The Maryland Jockey Club, which managed the Pimlico racetrack and is responsible for maintaining Preakness records, discarded both the electronic and "Daily Racing Form" times and recognized the clocker's 1:54 as the official time; however, the "Daily Racing Form", for the first time in history, printed its own clocking of 1:53 underneath the official time in the chart of the race.

On June 19, 2012, a special meeting of the Maryland Racing Commission was convened at <a href="Laurel%20Park%20Racecourse">Laurel Park</a> at the request of Penny Chenery, who hired companies to conduct a forensic review of the videotapes of the race. After over two hours of testimony, the commission unanimously voted to change the time of Secretariat's win from 1:54 to 1:53, establishing a new stakes record. The "Daily Racing Form" announced that it would honor the commission's ruling with regard to the running time. With the revised time, Sham also would have broken the old stakes record.

As Secretariat prepared for the <a href="Belmont%20Stakes">Belmont Stakes</a>, he appeared on the covers of three national magazines: "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>", "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>", and "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>". He had become a national celebrity. William Nack wrote: "Secretariat suddenly transcended horse racing and became a cultural phenomenon, a sort of undeclared national holiday from the tortures of <a href="Watergate">Watergate</a> and the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>." 
Chenery needed a secretary to handle all the fan mail and hired the <a href="William%20Morris%20Agency">William Morris Agency</a> to manage public engagements. Secretariat responded to his fame by learning to pose for the camera.

Only four horses ran against Secretariat for the June 9 <a href="1973%20Belmont%20Stakes">Belmont Stakes</a>, including Sham and three other horses thought to have little chance by the bettors: Twice A Prince, My Gallant, and Private Smiles. With so few horses in the race, and Secretariat expected to win, no "show" bets were taken. Secretariat was sent off as a 1–10 favorite before a crowd of 69,138, then the second largest attendance in Belmont history. The race was televised by CBS and was watched by over 15 million households, an <a href="Nielsen%20ratings%23Ratings.2Fshare%20and%20total%20viewers">audience share</a> of 52%.
On race day, the track was fast, and the weather was warm and sunny. Secretariat broke well on the rail and Sham rushed up beside him. The two ran the first quarter in a quick :23 and the next quarter in a swift :22, completing the fastest opening half mile in the history of the race and opening ten lengths on the rest of the field. After the six-furlong mark, Sham began to tire, ultimately finishing last. Secretariat continued the fast pace and opened up a larger and larger margin on the field. His time for the mile was 1:34, over a second faster than the next fastest Belmont mile fraction in history, set by his sire Bold Ruler, who had eventually tired and finished third. Secretariat, however, did not falter. Turcotte said, "This horse really paced himself. He is smart: I think he knew he was going miles, I never pushed him." In the stretch, Secretariat opened a lead of almost of a mile on the rest of the field. At the finish, he won by 31 lengths, breaking the margin-of-victory record set by Triple Crown winner <a href="Count%20Fleet">Count Fleet</a> in 1943 of 25 lengths.
CBS Television announcer <a href="Chic%20Anderson">Chic Anderson</a> described the horse's pace in a famous commentary: 
The time for the race was not only a record, it was the fastest miles on dirt in history, 2:24 flat, breaking the stakes record by more than two seconds. Secretariat's record still stands as an American record on the dirt. If the <a href="Beyer%20Speed%20Figure">Beyer Speed Figure</a> calculation had been developed during that time, Andrew Beyer calculated that Secretariat would have earned a figure of 139, the highest he has ever assigned.

A large crowd had started gathering around the paddock hours before the Belmont, many missing the races run earlier in the day for a chance to see the horses up close. Secretariat and Chenery were greeted with an enthusiasm that Chenery responded to with a wave or smile; Secretariat was imperturbable. A large cheer went up at the break, but as the race went on, the two most commonly reported reactions were disbelief and fear that Secretariat had gone too fast. When it was clear that Secretariat would win, the sound reached a crescendo that reportedly made the grandstand shake. "<a href="The%20Blood-Horse">The Blood-Horse</a>" magazine editor Kent Hollingsworth described the impact: "Two twenty-four flat! I don't believe it. Impossible. But I saw it. I can't breathe. He won by a sixteenth of a mile! I saw it. I have to believe it."

The race is widely considered the greatest performance of the twentieth century by a North American racehorse. Secretariat became the ninth Triple Crown winner in history, and the first since <a href="Citation%20%28horse%29">Citation</a> in 1948, a gap of 25 years. Bettors holding 5,427 winning parimutuel tickets on Secretariat never redeemed them, presumably keeping them as souvenirs (and because the tickets would have paid only $2.20 on a $2 bet).

Three weeks after his win at Belmont, Secretariat was shipped to <a href="Arlington%20Park">Arlington Park</a> for the <a href="Secretariat%20Stakes">Arlington Invitational</a>. Laurin explained: "Even before the Belmont, you remember, I said I really didn't know how I could give this horse a rest. He's so strong and full of energy. Well, this is only a week and a half after the Belmont, and believe me when I tell you, if I don't run this horse he's going to hurt himself in his stall. So we decided it would be nice to race him in Chicago to let the people in the Midwest have a chance to see him run." The race was run at miles with a purse of $125,000. The challengers were grouped as a single betting entry at 6–1: Secretariat was 1–20 (the legal minimum) and created a <a href="Glossary%20of%20North%20American%20horse%20racing%23M">minus pool</a> of $17,941.

Mayor <a href="Richard%20J.%20Daley">Richard Daley</a> of Chicago declared that the Saturday of the race was Secretariat Day. A crowd of 41,223 (the largest at Arlington in three decades) greeted his arrival on the track with sustained applause. Secretariat broke poorly but soon went to the lead, setting slow early fractions. He gathered momentum on the final turn and eventually won by nine lengths in 1:47 flat, just off the track record set by <a href="Damascus%20%28horse%29">Damascus</a>. <a href="George%20Plimpton">George Plimpton</a> commented, "With a better start, a horse to press him and less bow to his turns, Secretariat might have posted a time that would have stood a century."

Secretariat next went to Saratoga, popularly nicknamed "the graveyard of champions", in preparation for the <a href="Whitney%20Stakes">Whitney Stakes</a> on August 4, where he would face older horses the first time. On July 27, he put in a stunning workout of 1:34 for a mile on a sloppy track, a time that would have broken Saratoga's track record. On race day though, he was beaten by the <a href="Allen%20Jerkens">Allen Jerkens</a>-trained <a href="Onion%20%28horse%29">Onion</a>, a four-year-old <a href="gelding">gelding</a> who had set a track record at furlongs in his previous start. The <a href="Going%20%28horse%20racing%29%23USA">track condition</a> for the Whitney was labelled fast but was running slow, especially along the inside rail. Secretariat broke poorly and Onion led from the start, setting a slow pace running well off the rail. Down the backstretch, Turcotte chose to make his move along the rail rather than sweeping wide. Secretariat responded more sluggishly than usual and Turcotte went to the whip. Secretariat closed to within a head on the final turn before Onion pulled ahead in the straight to win by a length. A record crowd of more than 30,000 witnessed what was described as an "astonishing" upset.

Despite Jerkens's reputation as the "Giant Killer," Secretariat's stunning loss can possibly be attributed to a viral infection, which caused a low-grade fever and diarrhea. "I was learning then that anything could happen in horse racing," said Chenery. "We knew he had a low-grade infection. But we decided he was strong enough to win anyway, and we were wrong."

Secretariat lost his appetite and acted sluggishly for several days. Charles Hatton wrote: "He seemed distressingly ill walking off, and he missed the Travers. Returned to Belmont to point for the $250,000 Marlboro, the sport's pin-up horse looked bloody awful, rather like one of those sick paintings which betoken an inner theatre of the macabre. It required supernatural recuperative powers to recover as he did. He was subjected to four severe preps in two weeks. Astonishingly, he gained weight and blossomed with every trial."

On September 15, Secretariat returned to Belmont Park in the inaugural <a href="Marlboro%20Cup">Marlboro Cup</a>, which was originally intended to be a match race with stablemate <a href="Riva%20Ridge">Riva Ridge</a>, the 1972 Derby and Belmont Stakes winner. After Secretariat's loss in the Whitney, the field was expanded to invite top horses from across the country. Entries included 1972 <a href="Eclipse%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Male%20Turf%20Horse">turf champion</a> and top California stakes winner <a href="Cougar%20II">Cougar II</a>, <a href="Sovereign%20Award">Canadian champion</a> <a href="Kennedy%20Road%20%28horse%29">Kennedy Road</a>, 1972 <a href="Eclipse%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Three-Year-Old%20Colt">American champion three-year-old colt</a> <a href="Key%20to%20the%20Mint">Key to the Mint</a>, <a href="Travers%20Stakes">Travers</a> winner <a href="Annihilate%20%27Em">Annihilate 'Em</a> (the only other three-year-old in the race), and Onion. Riva Ridge was assigned top weight of 127 pounds (one pound over the <a href="weight-for-age">weight-for-age</a> scale), Key to the Mint and Cougar II were at 126 pounds, scale weight, while Secretariat was at 124, three pounds over scale for his age. The field included five champions, and the seven starters had won 63 stakes races between them.

It rained the night before, but the track dried out by race time. Secretariat stalked a fast pace in fifth, while Riva Ridge rated just behind Onion and Kennedy Road. Around the turn, Secretariat raced wide and started to make up ground. Coming into the stretch, Secretariat overtook Riva Ridge, while the other early leaders dropped back. Secretariat drew away to win, completing miles in 1:45 , then a world record on the dirt for the distance. Riva Ridge ran second with Cougar II in third and Onion in fourth. Turcotte said, "Today he was the old Secretariat and he did it on his own." The purse for the Marlboro Cup was $250,000, then the highest prize money offered: the win made Secretariat the 13th Thoroughbred millionaire in history.

After the Marlboro Cup, the original plan was to enter Riva Ridge in the mile <a href="Woodward%20Stakes">Woodward Stakes</a>, just two weeks later, while Secretariat put in some slow workouts on the turf in preparation for the Man o' War Stakes in October. It rained before the Woodward and the track was sloppy, which Riva Ridge could not handle, so Secretariat was entered in his place. Secretariat led into the straight but was overtaken by the Allen Jerkens-trained four-year-old <a href="Prove%20Out">Prove Out</a>, who pulled clear to win by lengths despite carrying five more pounds than Secretariat under the <a href="weight-for-age">weight-for-age</a> conditions of the race. Prove Out ran the race of his life that day: his time was the second-fastest mile-and-a-half on the dirt in Belmont Park's history despite the sloppy conditions. Prove Out went on to beat Riva Ridge in that year's Jockey Club Gold Cup.

On October 8, just nine days after the Woodward, Secretariat was moved to turf for the <a href="Man%20O%27%20War%20Stakes">Man O' War Stakes</a> at a distance of miles. He faced Tentam, who had set a world record for miles on the turf earlier that summer, and five others. Secretariat went to the lead early, followed by Tentam, who gradually closed the gap down the backstretch. Tentam got to within a half-length before Secretariat responded, pulling away by three lengths. Tentam made another run around the far turn, but Secretariat again drew away eventually winning by five lengths over Tentam, with Big Spruce seven and a half lengths further back in third. Secretariat set a course record time of 2:24. After the race, Ron Turcotte explained that "when Tentam came up to him in the backstretch I just chirped to him and he pulled away."

The syndication deal for Secretariat precluded the horse racing past age three. Accordingly, Secretariat's last race was against older horses in the <a href="Canadian%20International%20Stakes">Canadian International Stakes</a> over one and five-eighths miles on the turf at <a href="Woodbine%20Racetrack">Woodbine Racetrack</a> in <a href="Toronto%2C%20Ontario">Toronto, Ontario</a>, Canada on October 28, 1973. The race was chosen in part because of long-time ties between <a href="E.P.%20Taylor">E.P. Taylor</a> and the Chenery family, and partly to honor Secretariat's Canadian connections, Laurin and Turcotte. Unfortunately, Turcotte missed the race with a five-day suspension: <a href="Eddie%20Maple">Eddie Maple</a> got the mount.

The day of the race was cold, windy and wet, but the Marshall turf course was firm. Despite the weather, some 35,000 people turned out to greet Secretariat in a "virtual hysteria" that Secretariat seemed not to notice. His biggest opponents were Kennedy Road, whom he had already beaten in the Marlboro Cup, and Big Spruce, who had finished third in the Man o' War. Kennedy Road went to the early lead, while Secretariat moved to second after breaking from an outside post. On the backstretch, Secretariat made his move and forged to the lead. "Snorting steam in the raw twilight", he rounded the far turn with a 12-length lead before gearing down in the final furlong, ultimately winning by lengths. Once again, many winning tickets went uncashed by souvenir hunters.

After the race, Secretariat was brought to Aqueduct Racetrack where he was paraded with Turcotte dressed in the Meadow silks before a crowd of 32,990 in his final public appearance. "It's a sad day, and yet it's a great day," said Laurin. "I certainly wish he could run as a 4-year-old. He's a great horse and he loves to run."

Altogether, Secretariat won 16 of his 21 career races, with three seconds and one third, and total earnings of $1,316,808.

For 1973, Secretariat was again named Horse of the Year, and won Eclipse Awards as the <a href="American%20Champion%20Three-Year-Old%20Male%20Horse">American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse</a> and the <a href="American%20Champion%20Male%20Turf%20Horse">American Champion Male Turf Horse</a>.

When Secretariat first retired to Claiborne Farm, his sperm showed some signs of immaturity, so he was bred to three non-Thoroughbred mares in December 1973 to test his fertility. One of these, an <a href="Appaloosa">Appaloosa</a> named Leola, produced Secretariat's first foal in November 1974. Named First Secretary, the foal was a chestnut like his sire, but spotted like his dam.

Secretariat's first official foal crop, arriving in 1975, consisted of 28 foals, the best of which was <a href="Dactylographer%20%28horse%29">Dactylographer</a>, who won the <a href="William%20Hill%20Futurity">William Hill Futurity</a> in October 1977. The first crop also included <a href="Canadian%20Bound">Canadian Bound</a>, who at the 1976 <a href="Keeneland%20Sales">Keeneland July sale</a> was the first yearling to break the $1 million barrier, selling for $1.5 million. Canadian Bound, however, was a complete failure in racing, and for several years, the value of Secretariat's offspring declined considerably, especially given the rising popularity of <a href="Northern%20Dancer">Northern Dancer</a>'s offspring in the sales ring.

Secretariat eventually sired a number of major stakes winners, including:

Ultimately, Secretariat officially sired 663 named foals, including 341 winners (51.4%) and 54 stakes winners (8.1%) . There has been some criticism of Secretariat as a stallion, mainly because he did not produce male offspring of his own ability and did not leave a leading sire son behind, but his legacy is assured though the quality of his daughters, several of whom were excellent racers and even more of whom were excellent producers. In 1992, Secretariat was the <a href="leading%20broodmare%20sire%20in%20North%20America">leading broodmare sire in North America</a>. Overall, Secretariat's daughters produced 24 Grade/Group 1 winners. As a broodmare sire, Secretariat's most notable progeny were:

Through Weekend Surprise and Terlingua alone, Secretariat appears in the pedigree of numerous champions. Weekend Surprises's son A.P. Indy was the leading sire in North America in 2003 and 2006, and is the sire of 2003 Horse of the Year <a href="Mineshaft%20%28horse%29">Mineshaft</a> and 2007 Belmont Stakes winner <a href="Rags%20to%20Riches%20%28horse%29">Rags to Riches</a>. He has also established a successful sire-line that leads to Kentucky Derby winners <a href="Orb%20%28horse%29">Orb</a> and <a href="California%20Chrome">California Chrome</a>. A.P. Indy's leading sire-line descendant is <a href="Tapit">Tapit</a>, who led the sire list in 2014–2015 and is the sire of Belmont Stakes winners <a href="Tonalist">Tonalist</a> and <a href="Creator%20%28horse%29">Creator</a>. Terlingua's son Storm Cat is also a two time leading sire, whose offspring include <a href="Giant%27s%20Causeway">Giant's Causeway</a>, three-time leading sire in North America. Storm Cat also sired Yankee Gentleman, who is the broodmare sire of 2015 Triple Crown winner <a href="American%20Pharoah">American Pharoah</a>. Both Storm Cat and A.P. Indy appear in the pedigree of 2018 Triple Crown winner <a href="Justify%20%28horse%29">Justify</a>.

<a href="Inbreeding">Inbreeding</a> to Secretariat has also proven successful, as exemplified by numerous <a href="graded%20stakes%20race">graded stakes winners</a>, including two-time Horse of the Year <a href="Wise%20Dan">Wise Dan</a>, as well as <a href="Eclipse%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Sprint%20Horse">sprint champion</a> <a href="Speightstown%20%28horse%29">Speightstown</a>.

Secretariat's paddock at Claiborne Farm bordered three other stallions: <a href="Drone%20%28horse%29">Drone</a>, <a href="Sir%20Ivor">Sir Ivor</a>, and Hall of Fame inductee <a href="Spectacular%20Bid">Spectacular Bid</a>. Secretariat did not pay much attention to Drone or Sir Ivor, but he and Spectacular Bid became friendly and occasionally raced each other along the fence line between their paddocks.

In the fall of 1989, Secretariat became afflicted with <a href="laminitis">laminitis</a>—a painful and debilitating hoof condition. When his condition failed to improve after a month of treatment, he was <a href="Animal%20euthanasia">euthanized</a> on October 4 at the age of 19. Secretariat was buried at Claiborne Farm, given the rare honor of being buried whole (traditionally only the head, heart, and hooves of a winning race horse are buried).

At the time of Secretariat's death, the veterinarian who performed the <a href="necropsy">necropsy</a>, Dr. Thomas Swerczek, head pathologist at the University of Kentucky, did not weigh Secretariat's heart, but stated, "We just stood there in stunned silence. We couldn't believe it. The heart was perfect. There were no problems with it. It was just this huge engine." Later, Swerczek also performed a necropsy on Sham, who died in 1993. Swerczek did weigh Sham's heart, and it was . Based on Sham's measurement, and having necropsied both horses, he estimated Secretariat's heart probably weighed , or about 2.5 times that of the average horse ().

An extremely large heart is a trait that occasionally occurs in Thoroughbreds, hypothesized to be linked to a genetic condition, called the "<a href="Circulatory%20system%20of%20the%20horse%23X%20factor">x-factor</a>", passed down in specific inheritance patterns. The x-factor can be traced to the historic racehorse <a href="Eclipse%20%28horse%29">Eclipse</a>, who was necropsied after his death in 1789. Because Eclipse's heart appeared to be much larger than the hearts of other horses, it was weighed, and found to be , almost twice the normal weight. Eclipse is believed to have passed the trait on via his daughters, and pedigree research verified that Secretariat traces his <a href="Glossary%20of%20equestrian%20terms%23D">dam line</a> to a daughter of Eclipse. Secretariat's success as a broodmare sire has been linked by some to this large heart theory. However, it has not been proven whether the x-factor exists, let alone if it contributes to athletic ability.

Secretariat was inducted into the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Racing%20and%20Hall%20of%20Fame">National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame</a> in 1974, the year following his Triple Crown victory. Also in 1974, <a href="Paul%20Mellon">Paul Mellon</a> commissioned a bronze statue, sometimes known as "Secretariat in Full Stride", from John Skeaping. The life-size statue remained in the center of the walking ring at Belmont Park until 1988 when it was replaced by a replica. The original is now located at the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. The <a href="Kentucky%20Horse%20Park">Kentucky Horse Park</a> has two other life-sized statues of Secretariat. The first, created by <a href="Jim%20Reno">Jim Reno</a> in 1992, shows Secretariat as an older sire, while the second, completed by Edwin Bogucki in 2004, shows him being led into the winner's circle after the Kentucky Derby. In 2015, a new statue of Secretariat and Ron Turcotte crossing the finish line at the Belmont Stakes was unveiled in <a href="Grand%20Falls%2C%20New%20Brunswick">Grand Falls, New Brunswick</a>, Turcotte's hometown.
In 1994, "Sports Illustrated" ranked Secretariat #17 in their list of the 40 greatest sports figures of the past 40 years. In 1999, <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> listed him 35th of <a href="ESPN%20Sports%20Century">the 100 greatest North American athletes of the 20th century</a>, the highest of three non-humans on the list (the other two were also racehorses: <a href="Man%20o%27%20War">Man o' War</a> at 84th and Citation at 97th). Secretariat ranked second behind Man o' War in "<a href="The%20Blood-Horse">The Blood-Horse</a>"'s <a href="Blood-Horse%20magazine%20List%20of%20the%20Top%20100%20U.S.%20Racehorses%20of%20the%2020th%20Century">List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century</a>. He was also ranked second behind Man o' War by both a six-member panel of experts assembled by the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a>, and a "Sports Illustrated" panel of seven experts.

On October 16, 1999 in a ceremony conducted in the winner's circle at <a href="Keeneland%20Race%20Course">Keeneland Race Course</a> in <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">U.S. Postal Service</a> honored Secretariat with a 33-cent <a href="List%20of%20people%20on%20stamps%20of%20the%20United%20States">postage stamp</a> bearing his image. In 2005, Secretariat was featured in <a href="ESPN%20Classic">ESPN Classic</a>'s show "<a href="Who%27s%20No.%201%3F">Who's No. 1?</a>" in the episode "Greatest Sports Performances". He was the only nonhuman on the list, with his run at Belmont ranking second behind <a href="Wilt%20Chamberlain%27s%20100-point%20game">Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game</a>. On May 2, 2007, Secretariat was inducted into the Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame, marking the first time an animal received this honor. In 2013, Secretariat was inducted into the <a href="Canadian%20Horse%20Racing%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame</a> in honor of his victory in the Canadian International 40 years earlier. Secretariat was also the focus of a 2013 segment of "<a href="60%20Minutes%20Sports">60 Minutes Sports</a>". In March 2016, Secretariat's Triple Crown victory was rated #13 in the "Sports Illustrated" listing of the 100 Greatest Moments in Sports History.

Due to Secretariat's enduring popularity, Chenery remained a prominent figure in racing and a powerful advocate for Thoroughbred aftercare and veterinary research until her death in 2017. In 2004, the Maker's Mark Secretariat Center, dedicated to reschooling former racehorses and matching them to new homes, opened at the Kentucky Horse Park. In 2010, Chenery developed the <a href="Secretariat%20Vox%20Populi%20Award">Secretariat Vox Populi</a> ("voice of the people") Award, which is voted for by racing fans. It is intended to acknowledge "the horse whose popularity and racing excellence best resounded with the American public and gained recognition for Thoroughbred racing." The consideration of the racing fan's engagement is what distinguishes the Vox Populi award from others. The first honoree in 2010 was <a href="Zenyatta">Zenyatta</a>, that year's Horse of the Year, while the second award went to <a href="Rapid%20Redux">Rapid Redux</a>, a former claimer who went on to win 22 consecutive races at smaller racetracks. Paynter received the 2012 award for his battle with laminitis, the same condition that led to Secretariat's death. "Paynter's popularity stems from his ability to battle and exceed expectations, making him the perfect choice as the recipient of this year's Vox Populi Award", said Chenery. "After seeing firsthand the devastating effects of this disease, I am even more convinced that the industry must continue to diligently fight laminitis. The progress we have made to date clearly benefited Paynter — a beautiful colt with a tremendous spirit."

The Secretariat Stakes was created in 1974 to honor his appearance at Arlington Park in 1973. The Meadow, the farm at which he was born, was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>. It is now known as <a href="Meadow%20Event%20Park">The Meadow Historic District</a>.

"<a href="Secretariat%20%28film%29">Secretariat</a>", a <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Pictures">Disney</a> live-action film about the racing career of Secretariat, written by <a href="Mike%20Rich">Mike Rich</a> and directed by <a href="Randall%20Wallace">Randall Wallace</a>, was released on October 8, 2010.

In the animated series "<a href="BoJack%20Horseman">BoJack Horseman</a>", BoJack looked up to Secretariat as a child and would go on to star in a biopic about him. <a href="Margo%20Martindale">Margo Martindale</a>, who plays herself in a recurring role on the show, also had a role in the Disney film "Secretariat" mentioned above.

Secretariat's earnings in 1973 were, at the time, a single-season record.

Secretariat was sired by Bold Ruler, who led the North America sire list eight times, more than any other stallion in the 20th century. He also led the juvenile (two-year-old) sire list a record six times. Before Secretariat's Triple Crown run, Bold Ruler was often categorized as a sire of precocious juveniles that lacked stamina or did not train on past age two. However, even before Secretariat, Bold Ruler actually had sired 11 stakes winners of races at 10 furlongs or more. Ultimately, seven of the ten Kentucky Derby winners in the 1970s can be traced directly to Bold Ruler in their tail male lines, including Secretariat and fellow Triple Crown winner <a href="Seattle%20Slew">Seattle Slew</a>.

Secretariat's dam was Somethingroyal, the 1973 <a href="Kentucky%20Broodmare%20of%20the%20Year">Kentucky Broodmare of the Year</a>. Although Somethingroyal was unplaced in her only start, she had an excellent pedigree. Her sire Princequillo was the leading broodmare sire from 1966 to 1970 and was noted as a source of stamina and soundness. Her dam <a href="Imperatrice">Imperatrice</a> was a stakes winner who was purchased by Christopher Chenery at a dispersal sale in 1947 for $30,000. Imperatrice produced several stakes winners and stakes producers for the Meadow. Prior to foaling Secretariat at age 18, Somethingroyal had already produced <a href="Sir%20Gaylord">Sir Gaylord</a>, a stakes winner who became an important sire, whose offspring included <a href="Epsom%20Derby">Epsom Derby</a> winner Sir Ivor. Somethingroyal's other stakes winners were First Family, Sir Gaylord and Syrian Sea.

Breeders speak of a '<a href="Thoroughbred%20breeding%20theories%23Nicking">nick</a>" occurring when a sire or grandsire produces significantly better offspring from the daughters of one particular sire than with mares from other bloodlines. The breeding of Bold Ruler with Somethingroyal is an example of a famous nick between Bold Ruler's sire <a href="Nasrullah%20%28horse%29">Nasrullah</a> and daughters of Princequillo. The goal was to balance the speed, precocity, and fiery temperament provided by the Nasrullah side of the pedigree with Princequillo's stamina, soundness, and sensible temperament.

Guinea pig

The guinea pig or domestic guinea pig ("Cavia porcellus"), also known as cavy or domestic cavy, is a species of <a href="rodent">rodent</a> belonging to the family <a href="Caviidae">Caviidae</a> and the genus "<a href="Cavia">Cavia</a>". Despite their <a href="common%20name">common name</a>, guinea pigs are not native to <a href="Guinea%20%28region%29">Guinea</a>, nor are they biologically related to <a href="suidae">pig</a>s, and the origin of the name is still unclear. They originated in the <a href="Andes">Andes</a> of South America, and studies based on <a href="biochemistry">biochemistry</a> and <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridization</a> suggest they are <a href="domestication">domesticated</a> descendants of a closely related species of cavy such as "<a href="Montane%20Guinea%20Pig">C. tschudii</a>", and therefore do not exist naturally in the wild.
In <a href="Western%20society">Western society</a>, the domestic guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a <a href="Pet">household pet</a>, a type of <a href="pocket%20pet">pocket pet</a>, since its introduction by European traders in the 16th century. Their docile nature; friendly, even affectionate, responsiveness to handling and feeding; and the relative ease of caring for them have made and continue to make guinea pigs a popular choice of pet. Organizations devoted to the <a href="Animal%20fancy">competitive breeding</a> of guinea pigs have been formed worldwide, and many <a href="Guinea%20pig%20breed">specialized breeds</a> with varying <a href="Coat%20%28animal%29">coat</a> colors and textures are selected by <a href="Breeder%20%28animal%29">breeders</a>.
The domestic guinea pig plays an important role in <a href="folk%20culture">folk culture</a> for many <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Andes">indigenous Andean groups</a>, especially as a food source, but also in <a href="traditional%20medicine">folk medicine</a> and in community religious ceremonies. The animals are used for meat and are a culinary staple in the <a href="Andes%20Mountains">Andes Mountains</a>, where they are known as "cuy". A modern breeding program was started in the 1960s in Peru that resulted in large breeds known as "cuy mejorados" ("improved cuy") and prompted efforts to increase consumption of the animal outside South America.
<a href="Animal%20testing">Biological experimentation</a> on domestic guinea pigs has been carried out since the 17th century. The animals were so frequently used as <a href="model%20organism">model organism</a>s in the 19th and 20th centuries that the <a href="epithet">epithet</a> "guinea pig" came into use to describe a <a href="human%20subject%20research">human test subject</a>. Since that time, they have been largely replaced by other rodents such as <a href="House%20Mouse">mice</a> and <a href="Brown%20Rat">rats</a>. However, they are still used in research, primarily as models for human medical conditions such as <a href="diabetes%20mellitus%20type%201">juvenile diabetes</a>, <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, <a href="scurvy">scurvy</a> (like humans, they must get <a href="vitamin%20C">vitamin C</a>), and <a href="pre-eclampsia">pregnancy complications</a>.

The scientific name of the common species is "Cavia porcellus", with "" being <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "<a href="diminutive">little</a> pig". "Cavia" is <a href="New%20Latin">New Latin</a>; it is derived from "cabiai", the animal's name in the language of the <a href="Galibi">Galibi</a> tribes once native to <a href="French%20Guiana">French Guiana</a>. "Cabiai" may be an adaptation of the <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a> "çavia" (now "savia"), which is itself derived from the <a href="Tupian%20languages">Tupi</a> word "saujá", meaning rat. Guinea pigs are called "quwi" or "jaca" in <a href="Quechua%20language">Quechua</a> and "cuy" or "cuyo" (plural "cuyes, cuyos") in the <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> of Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. Ironically, <a href="Animal%20fancy">breeders</a> tend to use the more formal "cavy" to describe the animal, while in scientific and laboratory contexts, it is far more commonly referred to by the more colloquial "guinea pig".

How the animals came to be called "pigs" is not clear. They are built somewhat like <a href="pig">pig</a>s, with large heads relative to their bodies, stout necks, and rounded rumps with no tail of any consequence; some of the sounds they emit are very similar to those made by pigs, and they also spend a large amount of time eating. They can survive for long periods in small quarters, like a 'pig pen', and were thus easily transported on ships to Europe.

The animal's name alludes to pigs in many European languages. The <a href="German%20language">German</a> word for them is "<a href="wikt%3AMeerschweinchen">Meerschweinchen</a>", literally "little sea pig", which has been translated into <a href="Polish%20language">Polish</a> as "świnka morska", into <a href="Hungarian%20language">Hungarian</a> as "tengerimalac", and into <a href="Russian%20language">Russian</a> as "морская свинка". This derives from the <a href="Middle%20High%20German">Middle High German</a> name "merswin". This originally meant "<a href="dolphin">dolphin</a>" and was used because of the animals' grunting sounds (which were thought to be similar). Many other, possibly less scientifically based explanations of the German name exist. For example, sailing ships stopping to reprovision in the <a href="New%20World">New World</a> would pick up stores of guinea pigs, which provided an easily transportable source of fresh meat. The <a href="French%20language">French</a> term is "<a href="wikt%3Afr%3Acavia">cochon d'Inde</a>" (Indian pig) or "cobaye"; the <a href="Netherlands">Dutch</a> call it "<a href="wikt%3Anl%3Acavia">Guinees biggetje</a>" (Guinean piglet) or cavia (while in some Dutch dialects it is called "Spaanse rat"); and in <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a>, the guinea pig is variously referred to as "<a href="wikt%3Apt%3Acobaia">cobaia</a>", from the Tupi word via its Latinization, or as "porquinho da Índia" (little Indian pig). This is not universal; for example, the common word in Spanish is "<a href="wikt%3Aes%3Aconejillo%20de%20Indias">conejillo de Indias</a>" (little rabbit of the Indies). The Chinese refer to them as 豚鼠 ("túnshǔ", 'pig mouse'), and sometimes as Netherlands pig (荷蘭豬, "hélánzhū") or Indian mouse (天竺鼠, "tiānzhúshǔ"). The Japanese word for guinea pig is "モルモット" ("morumotto"), which derives from the name of another mountain-dwelling rodent, the <a href="marmot">marmot</a>; this is what guinea pigs were called by the Dutch traders who first brought them to Nagasaki in 1843. The other Japanese word for guinea pig, using kanji, is "tenjiku-nezumi" (天竺鼠, or てんじくねずみ), which literally translates as "India rat".

The origin of "guinea" in "guinea pig" is harder to explain. One proposed explanation is that the animals were brought to Europe by way of <a href="Guinea%20%28region%29">Guinea</a>, leading people to think they had originated there. "Guinea" was also frequently used in English to refer generally to any far-off, unknown country, so the name may simply be a colorful reference to the animal's exotic appeal. Another hypothesis suggests the "guinea" in the name is a corruption of "<a href="The%20Guianas">Guiana</a>", an area in <a href="South%20America">South America</a>. A common misconception is that they were so named because they were sold for the price of a <a href="Guinea%20%28British%20coin%29">guinea coin</a>; this hypothesis is untenable, because the guinea was first struck in England in 1663, and <a href="William%20Harvey">William Harvey</a> used the term "Ginny-pig" as early as 1653. Others believe "guinea" may be an alteration of the word <a href="wikt%3Aconey">coney</a> (rabbit); guinea pigs were referred to as "pig coneys" in <a href="Edward%20Topsell">Edward Topsell</a>'s 1607 treatise on <a href="quadrupedalism">quadrupeds</a>.

The guinea pig was first <a href="domestication">domesticated</a> as early as 5000 BC for food by tribes in the <a href="Andes">Andean</a> region of <a href="South%20America">South America</a> (the present-day southern part of <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a>, <a href="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>, <a href="Peru">Peru</a>, and <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>), some thousands of years after the domestication of the South American <a href="camelid">camelid</a>s. Statues dating from "circa" 500 BC to 500 AD that depict guinea pigs have been unearthed in archaeological digs in Peru and Ecuador. The <a href="Moche%20%28culture%29">Moche</a> people of ancient Peru worshipped animals and often depicted the guinea pig in their art. From about 1200 AD to the <a href="Spanish%20conquest%20of%20the%20Inca%20Empire">Spanish conquest</a> in 1532, selective breeding resulted in many varieties of domestic guinea pigs, which form the basis for some of the modern domestic breeds. They continue to be a food source in the region; many households in the Andean highlands raise the animal, which subsists on the family's vegetable scraps. Folklore traditions involving guinea pigs are numerous; they are exchanged as gifts, used in customary social and religious ceremonies, and frequently referenced in spoken metaphors. They also play a role in traditional healing rituals by folk doctors, or "<a href="curandero">curandero</a>s", who use the animals to diagnose diseases such as <a href="jaundice">jaundice</a>, <a href="rheumatism">rheumatism</a>, <a href="arthritis">arthritis</a>, and <a href="typhus">typhus</a>. They are rubbed against the bodies of the sick, and are seen as a supernatural medium. Black guinea pigs are considered especially useful for diagnoses. The animal also may be cut open and its entrails examined to determine whether the cure was effective. These methods are widely accepted in many parts of the Andes, where Western medicine is either unavailable or distrusted.

<a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spanish</a>, <a href="Dutch%20Empire">Dutch</a>, and <a href="British%20Empire">English</a> traders brought guinea pigs to <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, where they quickly became popular as <a href="exotic%20pet">exotic pet</a>s among the upper classes and royalty, including <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Queen Elizabeth I</a>. The earliest known written account of the guinea pig dates from 1547, in a description of the animal from <a href="Santo%20Domingo">Santo Domingo</a>; because cavies are not native to <a href="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a>, the animal was earlier believed to have been introduced there by Spanish travelers. However, based on more recent excavations on West Indian islands, the animal must have been introduced by ceramic-making horticulturalists from South America to the Caribbean around 500 BC, and it was present in the <a href="Ostionoid">Ostionoid</a> period, for example, on <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a>, long before the advent of the Spaniards. The guinea pig was first described in the West in 1554 by the <a href="Switzerland">Swiss</a> naturalist <a href="Conrad%20Gessner">Conrad Gessner</a>. Its <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">binomial scientific name</a> was first used by <a href="Johann%20Christian%20Polycarp%20Erxleben">Erxleben</a> in 1777; it is an amalgam of <a href="Peter%20Simon%20Pallas">Pallas</a>' <a href="Genus%20name">generic</a> designation (1766) and <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a>' <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific</a> conferral (1758). The earliest known European illustration of a domestic guinea pig is a painting (artist unknown) in the collection of the <a href="National%20Portrait%20Gallery%2C%20London">National Portrait Gallery</a> in London, dated to 1580, which shows a girl in typical Elizabethan dress holding a tortoise-shell guinea pig in her hands; she is flanked by her two brothers, one of whom holds a pet bird. The picture dates from the same period as the oldest recorded guinea pig remains in England, which are a partial cavy skeleton found at <a href="Hill%20Hall%20%28Essex%29">Hill Hall</a>, an Elizabethan manor house in <a href="Essex">Essex</a>, and dated to around 1575.

Guinea pigs are large for rodents; the common pet breeds weigh between when full grown and measure between in length. Some livestock breeds weigh when full grown. Pet breeds live an average of four to five years, but may live as long as eight. According to the 2006 "<a href="Guinness%20World%20Records">Guinness World Records</a>", the longest living guinea pig survived 14 years, 10.5 months. Most guinea pigs have fur, but one <a href="laboratory">laboratory</a> breed adopted by some pet owners, the <a href="skinny%20pig">skinny pig</a>, is a mostly furless breed. Some breeds are longfur breeds such as the <a href="Peruvian%20guinea%20pig">Peruvian</a>, the <a href="Silkie%20guinea%20pig">Silkie</a>, and the <a href="Texel%20Guinea%20Pig">Texel</a>.

In the 1990s, a minority scientific opinion emerged proposing that <a href="caviomorpha">caviomorphs</a>, such as guinea pigs, <a href="chinchilla">chinchilla</a>s, and <a href="Octodon">degu</a>s, are not rodents and should be <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">reclassified</a> as a separate <a href="order%20%28biology%29">order</a> of mammals (similar to <a href="lagomorpha">lagomorphs</a>). Subsequent research using wider sampling restored the consensus among mammalian biologists regarding the current classification of rodents as <a href="monophyly">monophyletic</a>.

Guinea pigs can learn complex paths to food, and can accurately remember a learned path for months. Their strongest problem-solving strategy is motion. While guinea pigs can jump small obstacles, most of them are poor climbers, and are not particularly agile. They startle extremely easily, and either freeze in place for long periods or run for cover with rapid, darting motions when they sense danger. Larger groups of startled guinea pigs "stampede", running in haphazard directions as a means of confusing predators. When happily excited, guinea pigs may repeatedly perform little hops in the air (known as "popcorning"), a movement analogous to the ferret's <a href="weasel%20war%20dance">war dance</a>. They are also good swimmers.

Like many rodents, guinea pigs sometimes participate in <a href="social%20grooming">social grooming</a>, and they regularly self-groom. A milky-white substance is secreted from their eyes and rubbed into the hair during the grooming process. Groups of boars often chew each other's hair, but this is a method of establishing hierarchy within a group, rather than a social gesture. Dominance is also established through biting (especially of the ears), <a href="Goose%20bumps">piloerection</a>, aggressive noises, head thrusts, and leaping attacks. Non-sexual simulated <a href="wikt%3Amount%23Verb">mounting</a> for dominance is also common among same-sex groups.

Guinea pig eyesight is not as good as that of a human in terms of distance and color, but they have a wider angle of vision (about 340°) and see in partial color (<a href="dichromacy">dichromacy</a>). They have well-developed senses of hearing, <a href="olfaction">smell</a>, and touch. 

Vocalization is the primary means of communication between members of the species. These are the most common sounds made by the guinea pig:

"C. porcellus" is not found naturally in the wild; it is likely descended from closely related species of <a href="cavia">cavies</a>, such as "<a href="Brazilian%20Guinea%20Pig">C. aperea</a>", "<a href="Shiny%20Guinea%20Pig">C. fulgida</a>", and "<a href="Montane%20Guinea%20Pig">C. tschudii</a>", which are still commonly found in various regions of South America. Studies from 2007–2010 applied molecular markers and studied the skull and skeletal morphology of current and mummified animals, thereby revealing the ancestor to most likely be "Cavia tschudii". Some species of cavy identified in the 20th century, such as "<a href="Cavia%20anolaimae">C. anolaimae</a>" and "<a href="Cavia%20guianae">C. guianae</a>", may be domestic guinea pigs that have become <a href="feral">feral</a> by reintroduction into the wild. Wild cavies are found on grassy plains and occupy an <a href="ecological%20niche">ecological niche</a> similar to that of <a href="cattle">cattle</a>. They are social, living in the wild in small groups that consist of several females (sows), a male (boar), and the young (which, in a break with the preceding <a href="pig">porcine</a> nomenclature, are called "pups" not "piglets"). They move together in groups (<a href="herd">herd</a>s) eating grass or other vegetation, and do not store food. While they do not <a href="burrow">burrow</a> themselves or build nests, they frequently seek shelter in the burrows of other animals, as well as in crevices and tunnels formed by <a href="vegetation">vegetation</a>. They <a href="crepuscular">tend to be most active during dawn and dusk (crepuscular)</a>, when it is harder for predators to spot them.

<a href="Domestication">Domesticated</a> guinea pigs thrive in groups of two or more; groups of sows, or groups of one or more sows and a neutered boar are common combinations, but boars can sometimes live together. Guinea pigs learn to recognize and bond with other individual pigs, and testing of boars shows their <a href="neuroendocrine">neuroendocrine</a> stress response is significantly lowered in the presence of a bonded female when compared to the presence of unfamiliar females. Groups of boars may also get along, provided their cage has enough space, they are introduced at an early age, and no females are present. Domestic guinea pigs have developed a different biological rhythm from their wild counterparts, and have longer periods of activity followed by short periods of sleep in between. Activity is scattered randomly throughout the day; aside from an avoidance of intense light, no regular <a href="circadian%20rhythm">circadian</a> patterns are apparent.

Domestic guinea pigs generally live in cages, although some owners of large numbers of guinea pigs dedicate entire rooms to their pets. Cages with solid or wire mesh floors are used, although wire mesh floors can cause injury and may be associated with an infection commonly known as <a href="bumblefoot%20%28infection%29">bumblefoot</a> (ulcerative pododermatitis). "Cubes and <a href="Coroplast">Coroplast</a>" (C&C) style cages are now a common choice. Cages are often lined with wood shavings or a similar material. Bedding made from red cedar (<a href="Eastern%20redcedar">Eastern</a> or <a href="Western%20redcedar">Western</a>) and <a href="pine">pine</a>, both <a href="softwood">softwood</a>s, were commonly used in the past, but these materials are now believed to contain harmful <a href="phenol">phenol</a>s (aromatic hydrocarbons) and oils. Safer bedding materials made from <a href="hardwood">hardwood</a>s (such as <a href="aspen">aspen</a>), paper products, and corn cob materials are other alternatives. Guinea pigs tend to be messy within their cages; they often jump into their food bowls or kick bedding and feces into them, and their <a href="urine">urine</a> sometimes crystallizes on cage surfaces, making it difficult to remove. After its cage has been cleaned, a guinea pig typically urinates and drags its lower body across the floor of the cage to mark its territory. Male guinea pigs may also mark their territory in this way when they are taken out of their cages.

Guinea pigs do not generally thrive when housed with other species. Housing guinea pigs with other rodents such as <a href="gerbil">gerbil</a>s and <a href="hamster">hamster</a>s may increase instances of respiratory and other infections, and such rodents may act aggressively toward the guinea pig. Larger animals may regard guinea pigs as <a href="predation">prey</a>, though some (such as dogs or cats) can be trained to accept them. Opinion is divided over the cohousing of guinea pigs and <a href="domestic%20rabbit">domestic rabbit</a>s. Some published sources say that guinea pigs and rabbits complement each other well when sharing a cage. However, rabbits have different nutritional requirements; as <a href="Lagomorpha">lagomorphs</a>, they synthesize their own <a href="Vitamin%20C">Vitamin C</a>, so the two species will not thrive if fed the same food when housed together. Rabbits may also harbor diseases (such as respiratory infections from "<a href="Bordetella">Bordetella</a>" and "<a href="Pasteurella">Pasteurella</a>"), to which guinea pigs are susceptible. Even a <a href="dwarf%20rabbit">dwarf rabbit</a> is generally stronger than a guinea pig and may cause intentional or inadvertent injury.

The guinea pig's natural diet is <a href="grass">grass</a>; their <a href="Molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a> are particularly suited for grinding plant matter and grow continuously throughout their life. Most mammals that graze are large and have a long digestive tract; guinea pigs have much longer <a href="Colon%20%28anatomy%29">colons</a> than most rodents, but they must also <a href="Dietary%20supplement">supplement</a> their diet by eating their feces (<a href="coprophagia">coprophagy</a>) . However, they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately, but produce special soft pellets, called <a href="cecotrope">cecotrope</a>s (or caecal pellets), which recycle <a href="B%20vitamins">B vitamins</a>, fiber, and bacteria required for proper digestion. The cecotropes are eaten directly from the anus, unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese. They share this behaviour with <a href="rabbit">rabbit</a>s. In geriatric boars or sows (rarely in young ones), the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus can become weak. This creates a condition known as "anal impaction", which prevents the animal from redigesting cecotropes even though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass. The condition may be temporarily alleviated by a human carefully removing the impacted feces from the anus.

Guinea pigs benefit from a diet of fresh <a href="grass%20hay">grass hay</a>, such as <a href="Timothy-grass">timothy hay</a>, in addition to <a href="food%20pellets">food pellets</a> which are often based on timothy hay. <a href="Alfalfa">Alfalfa</a> hay is also a popular food choice and most guinea pigs will eat large amounts of alfalfa when offered it, though some controversy exists over offering alfalfa to adult guinea pigs. Some pet owners and veterinary organizations have advised that, as a <a href="legume">legume</a> rather than a grass hay, alfalfa consumed in large amounts may lead to <a href="obesity">obesity</a>, as well as <a href="bladder%20stone%20%28animal%29">bladder stones</a> from the excess <a href="calcium">calcium</a> in all animals except for pregnant and very young guinea pigs. However, published scientific sources mention alfalfa as a food source that can replenish protein, <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s, and fiber.

Like humans, but unlike most other <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s, guinea pigs cannot synthesize their own <a href="vitamin%20C">vitamin C</a> and must obtain this vital <a href="nutrient">nutrient</a> from food. If guinea pigs do not ingest enough vitamin C, they can suffer from potentially fatal <a href="scurvy">scurvy</a>. Guinea pigs require about 10 mg of vitamin C daily (20 mg if pregnant), which can be obtained through fresh, raw fruits and vegetables (such as broccoli, apple, cabbage, carrot, celery, and spinach) or through dietary supplements or by eating fresh <a href="Animal%20feed%23Fodder">pellets</a> designed for guinea pigs, if they have been handled properly. Healthy diets for guinea pigs require a complex balance of calcium, <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>, <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>, <a href="potassium">potassium</a>, and <a href="hydrogen%20ion">hydrogen ion</a>s; but adequate amounts of vitamins <a href="Vitamin%20A">A</a>, <a href="Vitamin%20D">D</a>, and <a href="Vitamin%20E">E</a> are also necessary.

Poor diets for guinea pigs have been associated with <a href="muscular%20dystrophy">muscular dystrophy</a>, <a href="metastatic%20calcification">metastatic calcification</a>, difficulties with pregnancy, <a href="vitamin%20deficiencies">vitamin deficiencies</a>, and teeth problems. Guinea pigs tend to be <a href="Picky%20eating">fickle eaters</a> when it comes to fresh fruits and vegetables after having learned early in life what is and is not appropriate to consume, and their eating habits may be difficult to change after maturity. They do not respond well to sudden changes in their diet and they may stop eating and starve rather than accept new food types. A constant supply of hay is generally recommended, as guinea pigs feed continuously and may develop bad habits if food is not present, such as chewing on their hair. Because their teeth grow constantly (as do their nails, like humans), they routinely <a href="wikt%3Agnaw">gnaw</a> on things, lest their teeth become too large for their jaw (a common problem in <a href="rodent">rodent</a>s). Guinea pigs chew on cloth, paper, plastic, and rubber, if they are available.

A number of plants are poisonous to guinea pigs, including <a href="bracken">bracken</a>, <a href="Bryonia">bryony</a>, <a href="ranunculus">buttercup</a>, <a href="sinapis%20arvensis">charlock</a>, <a href="atropa%20belladonna">deadly nightshade</a>, <a href="digitalis">foxglove</a>, <a href="hellebore">hellebore</a>, <a href="conium">hemlock</a>, <a href="lily%20of%20the%20valley">lily of the valley</a>, <a href="Anthemis%20cotula">mayweed</a>, <a href="aconitum">monkshood</a>, <a href="privet">privet</a>, <a href="Senecio">ragwort</a>, <a href="rhubarb">rhubarb</a>, <a href="veronica%20arvensis">speedwell</a>, toadflax (both "<a href="Linaria%20vulgaris">Linaria vulgaris</a>" and "<a href="Linaria%20dalmatica">Linaria dalmatica</a>"), and <a href="vallisneria%20americana">wild celery</a>. Additionally, any plant which grows from a <a href="bulb">bulb</a> (e.g., <a href="tulip">tulip</a> or <a href="onion">onion</a>) is normally considered poisonous, as well as ivy and oak tree leaves. A guinea pig may or may not eat poisonous material.

Males reach sexual maturity in 3–5 weeks, while females can be fertile as early as 4 weeks old, and can carry litters before they are adults. The female guinea pig is able to breed year-round, with spring being the peak. A sow can have as many as five litters in a year, but six is theoretically possible. Unlike the offspring of most <a href="rodents">rodents</a>, which are <a href="altricial">altricial</a> at birth, newborn cavy pups are <a href="Precociality">precocial</a>, and are well-developed with hair, teeth, claws, and partial eyesight. The pups are immediately mobile and begin eating solid food immediately, though they continue to <a href="breastfeeding">suckle</a>. Females can once again become pregnant 6–48 hours after giving birth, but it is not healthy for a female to be constantly pregnant.

The <a href="gestation">gestation</a> period lasts from to , with an average of 63–68 days. Because of the long gestation period and the large size of the pups, pregnant females may become large and <a href="eggplant">eggplant</a>-shaped, although the change in size and shape varies depending upon the size of the litter. <a href="Litter%20%28animal%29">Litter</a> size ranges from one to six, with three being the average; the largest recorded litter size is 17. The guinea pig mother only has two nipples, but she can readily raise the more average-sized litters of 2 to 4 pups. In smaller litters, difficulties may occur during <a href="Childbirth">labour</a> due to oversized pups. Large litters result in higher incidences of <a href="stillbirth">stillbirth</a>, but because the pups are delivered at an advanced stage of development, lack of access to the mother's milk has little effect on the mortality rate of newborns.

Cohabitating females assist in mothering duties if lactating; guinea pigs practice <a href="Alloparenting">alloparental care</a>, in which a female may adopt the pup(s) of another. This might take place if the original parents die or are for some reason separated from them. This behavior is common and is seen in many other animal species such as the elephant.

<a href="pre-eclampsia">Toxemia of pregnancy</a> (hypertension) is a common problem and kills many pregnant females. Signs of toxemia include: <a href="Anorexia%20nervosa">anorexia</a>, <a href="Lethargy">lack of energy</a>, <a href="Salivation">excessive salivation</a>, a <a href="Bad%20breath">sweet or fruity breath odor</a> due to <a href="ketone">ketone</a>s, and <a href="seizure">seizure</a>s in advanced cases. Pregnancy toxemia appears to be most common in hot climates. Other serious complications during pregnancy can include a <a href="prolapse">prolapsed uterus</a>, <a href="hypocalcaemia">hypocalcaemia</a>, and <a href="mastitis">mastitis</a>.

Females that do not give birth may develop an irreversible fusing of the <a href="pubic%20symphysis">pubic symphysis</a>, a joint in the <a href="pelvis">pelvis</a>, due to calcification which may occur between 6 and 10 months of age. If they become pregnant after this has happened, the birth canal will probably not widen sufficiently and this may lead to <a href="dystocia">dystocia</a> and death as they attempt to give birth. Calcification of the female's pubic symphysis if not bred is greatly overstated. The reason for potential calcification is a metabolic disease, like <a href="ochronosis">ochronosis</a>. A healthy, normal female guinea pig's pubic symphysis does not calcify.
Male and female guinea pigs do not <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">differ in appearance</a> apart from general size, with the male being about 30% larger. The position of the anus is very close to the <a href="genitals">genitals</a> in both sexes. Female genitals are distinguished by a Y-shaped configuration formed from a vulvar flap. While male genitals may look similar, with the penis and anus forming a similar shape, the penis will protrude if pressure is applied to the surrounding hair. The male's <a href="testes">testes</a> may also be visible externally from scrotal swelling.

Common ailments in domestic guinea pigs include <a href="Lower%20respiratory%20tract%20infection">respiratory tract infections</a>, <a href="diarrhea">diarrhea</a>, scurvy (vitamin C deficiency, typically characterized by sluggishness), <a href="abscess">abscess</a>es due to infection (often in the neck, due to hay embedded in the throat, or from external scratches), and infections by <a href="louse">lice</a>, <a href="mite">mite</a>s, or <a href="fungus">fungus</a>.

Mange mites ("Trixacarus caviae") are a common cause of hair loss, and other symptoms may also include excessive scratching, unusually aggressive behavior when touched (due to pain), and, in some instances, seizures. Guinea pigs may also suffer from "running lice" ("Gliricola porcelli"), a small, white insect which can be seen moving through the hair; their eggs, which appear as black or white specks attached to the hair, are sometimes referred to as "static lice". Other causes of hair loss can be due to hormonal upsets caused by underlying medical conditions such as <a href="ovarian%20cyst">ovarian cyst</a>s.

Foreign bodies, especially small pieces of hay or straw, can become lodged in the eyes of guinea pigs, resulting in excessive blinking, tearing, and in some cases an opaque film over the eye due to <a href="corneal%20ulcers%20in%20animals">corneal ulcer</a>. Hay or straw dust can also cause <a href="sneeze">sneezing</a>. While it is normal for guinea pigs to sneeze periodically, frequent sneezing may be a symptom of <a href="pneumonia%20%28non-human%29">pneumonia</a>, especially in response to atmospheric changes. Pneumonia may also be accompanied by <a href="torticollis">torticollis</a> and can be fatal.

Because the guinea pig has a stout, compact body, it more easily tolerates excessive cold than excessive heat. Its normal <a href="thermoregulation">body temperature</a> is , so its ideal ambient air temperature range is similar to a human's, about . Consistent ambient temperatures in excess of have been linked to <a href="hyperthermia">hyperthermia</a> and death, especially among pregnant sows. Guinea pigs are not well suited to environments that feature wind or frequent drafts, and respond poorly to extremes of <a href="humidity">humidity</a> outside of the range of 30–70%.

Guinea pigs are <a href="Predation">prey</a> animals whose survival instinct is to mask pain and signs of illness, and many times health problems may not be apparent until a condition is severe or in its advanced stages. Treatment of disease is made more difficult by the extreme sensitivity guinea pigs have to most <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s, including <a href="penicillin">penicillin</a>, which kill off the <a href="gut%20flora">intestinal flora</a> and quickly bring on episodes of diarrhea and in some cases, death.

Similar to the inherited <a href="genetic%20disorder">genetic diseases</a> of other breeds of animal (such as <a href="Hip%20dysplasia%20%28canine%29">hip dysplasia</a> in canines), a number of genetic abnormalities of guinea pigs have been reported. Most commonly, the <a href="roan%20%28color%29%23Roan%20Guinea%20Pigs">roan</a> coloration of <a href="Abyssinian%20guinea%20pig">Abyssinian</a> guinea pigs is associated with <a href="congenital%20disorder">congenital</a> eye disorders and problems with the digestive system. Other genetic disorders include "waltzing disease" (deafness coupled with a tendency to run in circles), <a href="%3Awikt%3Apalsy">palsy</a>, and <a href="tremor">tremor</a> conditions.

If handled correctly early in life, guinea pigs become amenable to being picked up and carried, and seldom bite or scratch. They are timid explorers and often hesitate to attempt an escape from their cage even when an opportunity presents itself. Still, they show considerable curiosity when allowed to walk freely, especially in familiar and safe terrain. Guinea pigs that become familiar with their owner will whistle on the owner's approach; they will also learn to whistle in response to the rustling of plastic bags or the opening of refrigerator doors, where their food is most commonly stored. In Switzerland, owning a single guinea pig is considered harmful to its well-being and forbidden by law.

<a href="Domestication">Domesticated</a> guinea pigs occur in many breeds, which have been developed since their introduction to Europe and North America. These varieties vary in hair and color composition. The most common varieties found in pet stores are the English shorthair (also known as the American), which have a short, smooth coat, and the <a href="Abyssinian%20guinea%20pig">Abyssinian</a>, whose coat is ruffled with <a href="cowlick">cowlick</a>s, or <a href="rosette%20%28zoology%29">rosettes</a>. Also popular among breeders are the <a href="Guinea%20pig%20breed%23Peruvian">Peruvian</a> and the <a href="Guinea%20pig%20breed%23Silkie%20or%20Sheltie">Sheltie</a> (or Silkie), both straight longhair breeds, and the <a href="Guinea%20pig%20breed%23Texel">Texel</a>, a curly longhair. Grooming of guinea pigs is primarily accomplished using combs or brushes. Shorthair breeds are typically brushed weekly, while longhair breeds may require daily grooming.

Cavy clubs and associations dedicated to the showing and breeding of guinea pigs have been established worldwide. The American Cavy Breeders Association, an adjunct to the <a href="American%20Rabbit%20Breeders%27%20Association">American Rabbit Breeders' Association</a>, is the governing body in the United States and Canada. The <a href="British%20Cavy%20Council">British Cavy Council</a> governs cavy clubs in the United Kingdom. Similar organizations exist in Australia (Australian National Cavy Council) and New Zealand (New Zealand Cavy Council). Each club publishes its own standard of perfection and determines which breeds are eligible for showing.

<a href="Allergy">Allergic</a> symptoms, including <a href="rhinitis">rhinitis</a>, <a href="conjunctivitis">conjunctivitis</a>, and <a href="asthma">asthma</a>, have been documented in laboratory animal workers who come into contact with guinea pigs. Allergic reactions following direct exposure to guinea pigs in domestic settings have also been reported. Two major guinea pig allergens, Cav p I and Cav p II, have been identified in guinea pig fluids (urine and saliva) and guinea pig <a href="dander">dander</a>. People who are allergic to guinea pigs are usually allergic to hamsters and gerbils, as well. <a href="Allergy%20shots">Allergy shots</a> can successfully treat an allergy to guinea pigs, although treatment can take up to 18 months.

As a result of their widespread popularity, especially in households with children, guinea pigs have shown a presence in culture and media. Some noted appearances of the animal in <a href="literature">literature</a> include the short story "<a href="Pigs%20Is%20Pigs">Pigs Is Pigs</a>" by <a href="Ellis%20Parker%20Butler">Ellis Parker Butler</a>, which is a tale of <a href="bureaucracy">bureaucratic</a> incompetence. Two guinea pigs held at a railway station breed unchecked while humans argue as to whether they are "pigs" or "pets" for the purpose of determining freight charges. Butler's story, in turn, inspired the "" episode "<a href="The%20Trouble%20with%20Tribbles">The Trouble with Tribbles</a>", written by <a href="David%20Gerrold">David Gerrold</a>. In the <a href="Golden%20Hamster%20Saga">Golden Hamster Saga</a> books, two guinea pigs named Enrico and Caruso are modern-day thespians (named after <a href="Enrico%20Caruso">Enrico Caruso</a>) who serve as secondary characters, and often irritate the main character, <a href="Freddy%20Auratus">Freddy Auratus</a>, who strongly dislikes their acting antics.

"<a href="The%20Fairy%20Caravan">The Fairy Caravan</a>", a novel by <a href="Beatrix%20Potter">Beatrix Potter</a>, and <a href="Michael%20Bond">Michael Bond</a>'s <a href="Olga%20da%20Polga">Olga da Polga</a> series for children, both feature guinea pigs as the <a href="protagonist">protagonist</a>. Another appearance is in "<a href="The%20Magician%27s%20Nephew">The Magician's Nephew</a>" by <a href="C.%20S.%20Lewis">C. S. Lewis</a>: in the first (chronologically) of his "<a href="The%20Chronicles%20of%20Narnia">The Chronicles of Narnia</a>" series, a guinea pig is the first creature to travel to the <a href="Wood%20between%20the%20Worlds">Wood between the Worlds</a>. In <a href="Ursula%20Dubosarsky">Ursula Dubosarsky</a>'s "Maisie and the Pinny Gig", a little girl has a recurrent dream about a giant guinea pig, while guinea pigs feature significantly in several of Dubosarsky's other books, including the young adult novel "The White Guinea Pig" and "The Game of the Goose".

Guinea pigs have also been featured in film and television. In the TV movie "<a href="Shredderman%20Rules">Shredderman Rules</a>", the main character and the main character's crush both have guinea pigs which play a minor part in the plot. A guinea pig named Rodney, voiced by <a href="Chris%20Rock">Chris Rock</a>, was a prominent character in the 1998 film "<a href="Dr.%20Dolittle%20%28film%29">Dr. Dolittle</a>", and Linny the Guinea pig is a co-star on <a href="Nick%20Jr.%20%28TV%20channel%29">Nick Jr.</a>'s "<a href="Wonder%20Pets">Wonder Pets</a>". Guinea pigs were used in some major <a href="advertising">advertising campaigns</a> in the 1990s and 2000s, notably for <a href="Egg%20Banking">Egg Banking plc</a>, <a href="Snapple">Snapple</a>, and <a href="Blockbuster%20Inc.">Blockbuster Video</a>. The Blockbuster campaign is considered by some guinea pig advocates to have been a factor in the rise of caging guinea pigs and rabbits together. In the "<a href="South%20Park">South Park</a>" <a href="South%20Park%20%28season%2012%29">season 12</a> episode "", giant guinea pigs dressed in costumes rampage over the Earth. The 2009 <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Pictures">Walt Disney Pictures</a> movie "<a href="G-Force%20%28film%29">G-Force</a>" features a group of highly intelligent guinea pigs trained as operatives of the U.S. government. A video game based on the movie was also released. A guinea pig named Bugsy appears in the 2008 film "<a href="Bedtime%20Stories%20%28film%29">Bedtime Stories</a>". A guinea pig named Cashew features prominently in the second season of the U.S. adaptation of "<a href="House%20of%20Cards%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">House of Cards</a>".

Guinea pigs (called "cuy", "cuye", or "curí") were originally domesticated for their meat in the Andes. Traditionally, the animal was reserved for ceremonial meals by indigenous people in the Andean highlands, but since the 1960s, it has become more socially acceptable for consumption by all people. It continues to be a major part of the diet in Peru and Bolivia, particularly in the Andes Mountains highlands; it is also eaten in some areas of Ecuador (mainly in the <a href="Geography%20of%20Ecuador%23La%20Sierra%20%28the%20highlands%29">Sierra</a>) and in Colombia, exclusively in highland locations in the department of Nariño near the border with Ecuador. Because guinea pigs require much less room than traditional <a href="livestock">livestock</a> and reproduce extremely quickly, they are a more profitable source of food and income than many traditional stock animals, such as pigs and cattle; moreover, they can be raised in an urban environment. Both rural and urban families raise guinea pigs for supplementary income, and the animals are commonly bought and sold at local markets and large-scale municipal fairs.
Guinea pig meat is high in <a href="protein">protein</a> and low in <a href="fat">fat</a> and <a href="cholesterol">cholesterol</a>, and is described as being similar to rabbit and the dark meat of <a href="chicken%20%28food%29">chicken</a>. The animal may be served fried ("chactado" or "frito"), broiled ("asado"), or roasted ("al horno"), and in urban restaurants may also be served in a <a href="casserole">casserole</a> or a <a href="fricassee">fricassee</a>. Ecuadorians commonly consume "sopa" or "locro de cuy", a soup dish. "<a href="Pachamanca">Pachamanca</a>" or "<a href="huatia">huatia</a>", a process similar to <a href="barbecue">barbecue</a>ing, is also popular, and is usually served with corn beer ("<a href="chicha">chicha</a>") in traditional settings.

Peruvians consume an estimated 65 million guinea pigs each year, and the animal is so entrenched in the culture that one famous painting of the <a href="Last%20Supper">Last Supper</a> in the <a href="Cusco%20Cathedral">main cathedral in Cusco</a> shows <a href="Christ">Christ</a> and the 12 disciples dining on guinea pig. The animal remains an important aspect of certain religious events in both rural and urban areas of Peru. A religious celebration known as "jaca tsariy" ("collecting the cuys") is a major festival in many villages in the <a href="Antonio%20Raymondi%20Province">Antonio Raimondi</a> province of eastern Peru, and is celebrated in smaller ceremonies in <a href="Lima">Lima</a>. It is a <a href="syncretism">syncretistic</a> event, combining elements of <a href="Catholicism">Catholicism</a> and <a href="pre-Columbian">pre-Columbian</a> religious practices, and revolves around the celebration of local <a href="patron%20saint">patron saint</a>s. The exact form the "jaca tsariy" takes differs from town to town; in some localities, a "sirvinti" (servant) is appointed to go from door to door, collecting donations of guinea pigs, while in others, guinea pigs may be brought to a communal area to be released in a mock <a href="bullfighting">bullfight</a>. Meals such as "cuy chactado" are always served as part of these festivities, and the killing and serving of the animal is framed by some communities as a symbolic <a href="satire">satire</a> of local politicians or important figures. In the <a href="Tungurahua%20Province">Tungurahua</a> and <a href="Cotopaxi%20Province">Cotopaxi</a> provinces of central Ecuador, guinea pigs are employed in the celebrations surrounding the feast of <a href="Corpus%20Christi%20%28feast%29">Corpus Christi</a> as part of the "Ensayo", which is a community meal, and the "Octava", where "castillos" (greased poles) are erected with prizes tied to the crossbars, from which several guinea pigs may be hung. The Peruvian town of <a href="Churin">Churin</a> has an annual festival which involves dressing guinea pigs in elaborate costumes for a competition. There are also guinea pig festivals held in <a href="Huancayo">Huancayo</a>, <a href="Cusco">Cusco</a>, <a href="Lima">Lima</a>, and <a href="Huacho">Huacho</a>, featuring costumes and guinea pig dishes. Most guinea pig celebrations take place on the National Guinea Pig Day (Día Nacional del Cuy) across Peru on the second Friday of October.

Peruvian research universities, especially <a href="La%20Molina%20National%20Agrarian%20University">La Molina National Agrarian University</a>, began experimental programs in the 1960s with the intention of breeding larger-sized guinea pigs. Subsequent university efforts have sought to change breeding and husbandry procedures in South America, to make the raising of guinea pigs as livestock more economically sustainable. The variety of guinea pig produced by La Molina is fast-growing and can weigh . All the large breeds of guinea pig are known as "cuy mejorados" and the pet breeds are known as "cuy criollos". The three original lines out of Peru were the "Perú" (weighing by 2 weeks), the "Andina", and the "Inti".

Andean immigrants in New York City raise and sell guinea pigs for meat, and some South American restaurants in major cities in the United States serve "cuy" as a <a href="delicacy">delicacy</a>. In the 1990s and 2000s, La Molina University began exporting large breed guinea pigs to Europe, Japan, and the United States in the hope of increasing human consumption outside of countries in northern South America.

Many efforts have also been made to promote guinea pig <a href="animal%20husbandry">husbandry</a> in developing countries of <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a>, where they occur more widely than generally known because they are usually not covered by livestock statistics. However, it has not been known when and where the animals have been introduced to Africa. In <a href="Cameroon">Cameroon</a>, they are widely distributed. In the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>, they can be found both in peri-urban environments as well as in rural regions, for example, in <a href="South%20Kivu">South Kivu</a>. They are also frequently held in rural households in <a href="Iringa%20Region">Iringa Region</a> of southwestern <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>.

The use of guinea pigs in scientific experimentation dates back at least to the 17th century, when the Italian biologists <a href="Marcello%20Malpighi">Marcello Malpighi</a> and <a href="Carlo%20Fracassati">Carlo Fracassati</a> conducted <a href="vivisection">vivisection</a>s of guinea pigs in their examinations of <a href="anatomy">anatomic</a> structures. In 1780, <a href="Antoine%20Lavoisier">Antoine Lavoisier</a> used a guinea pig in his experiments with the <a href="calorimeter">calorimeter</a>, a device used to measure heat production. The heat from the guinea pig's respiration melted snow surrounding the calorimeter, showing that respiratory gas exchange is a <a href="combustion">combustion</a>, similar to a candle burning. Guinea pigs played a major role in the establishment of <a href="germ%20theory%20of%20disease">germ theory</a> in the late 19th century, through the experiments of <a href="Louis%20Pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a>, <a href="Pierre%20Paul%20%C3%89mile%20Roux">Émile Roux</a>, and <a href="Robert%20Koch">Robert Koch</a>. Guinea pigs have been <a href="animals%20in%20space">launched into orbital space flight</a> several times, first by the <a href="Soviet%20Union">USSR</a> on the <a href="Sputnik%209">Sputnik 9</a> <a href="biosatellite">biosatellite</a> of March 9, 1961 – with a successful recovery. <a href="China">China</a> also launched and recovered a biosatellite in 1990 which included guinea pigs as passengers.

In <a href="English%20language">English</a>, the term "guinea pig" is commonly used as a metaphor for a subject of scientific experimentation, or any experiment or test in modern times. This dates back to the early 20th century; the "<a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>" notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913. In 1933, <a href="Consumers%20Research">Consumers Research</a> founders <a href="F.%20J.%20Schlink">F. J. Schlink</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Kallet">Arthur Kallet</a> wrote a book entitled "<a href="100%2C000%2C000%20Guinea%20Pigs">100,000,000 Guinea Pigs</a>", extending the metaphor to consumer society. The book became a national bestseller in the United States, thus further popularizing the term, and spurred the growth of the <a href="consumer%20protection">consumer protection</a> movement. During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the <a href="Plastic%20surgery">plastic surgeon</a> <a href="Archibald%20McIndoe">Archibald McIndoe</a> established the <a href="Guinea%20Pig%20Club">Guinea Pig Club</a> at <a href="Queen%20Victoria%20Hospital">Queen Victoria Hospital</a>, <a href="East%20Grinstead">East Grinstead</a>, Sussex, England as a social club and mutual support network for his patients, who were undergoing previously-untested reconstruction procedures. The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel "The Guinea Pigs" (1970) by <a href="Czechs">Czech</a> author <a href="Ludv%C3%ADk%20Vacul%C3%ADk">Ludvík Vaculík</a> as an allegory for <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> <a href="totalitarianism">totalitarianism</a>. Guinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century: about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s, but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s. As of 2007, they constitute about 2% of the current total of laboratory animals. In the past, they were widely used to standardize <a href="vaccine">vaccine</a>s and <a href="antiviral%20drug">antiviral agents</a>; they were also often employed in studies on the production of <a href="antibody">antibodies</a> in response to extreme <a href="allergy">allergic reactions</a>, or <a href="anaphylaxis">anaphylaxis</a>. Less common uses included research in <a href="pharmacology">pharmacology</a> and <a href="irradiation">irradiation</a>. Since the middle 20th century, they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats. This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents, although geneticists <a href="William%20Ernest%20Castle">W. E. Castle</a> and <a href="Sewall%20Wright">Sewall Wright</a> made a number of contributions to this area of study, especially regarding <a href="biological%20pigment">coat color</a>. In 2004, the U.S.'s <a href="National%20Human%20Genome%20Research%20Institute">National Human Genome Research Institute</a> announced plans to sequence the <a href="genome">genome</a> of the domestic guinea pig.

The guinea pig was most extensively implemented in research and diagnosis of <a href="infectious%20disease">infectious disease</a>s. Common uses included identification of <a href="brucellosis">brucellosis</a>, <a href="Chagas%20disease">Chagas disease</a>, <a href="cholera">cholera</a>, <a href="diphtheria">diphtheria</a>, <a href="foot-and-mouth%20disease">foot-and-mouth disease</a>, <a href="glanders">glanders</a>, <a href="Q%20fever">Q fever</a>, <a href="Rocky%20Mountain%20spotted%20fever">Rocky Mountain spotted fever</a>, and various strains of <a href="typhus">typhus</a>. They are still frequently used to diagnose <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, since they are easily infected by human tuberculosis bacteria. Because guinea pigs are one of the few animals which, like humans and other <a href="primate">primate</a>s, cannot synthesize vitamin C, but must obtain it from their diet, they are ideal for researching scurvy. From the accidental discovery in 1907 that scurvy could be induced in guinea pigs, to their use to prove the chemical structure of the "ascorbutic factor" in 1932, the guinea pig model proved a crucial part of vitamin C research.

<a href="Complement%20system">Complement</a>, an important component for <a href="serology">serology</a>, was first isolated from the blood of the guinea pig. Guinea pigs have an unusual insulin mutation, and are a suitable species for the generation of anti-insulin antibodies. Present at a level 10 times that found in other mammals, the insulin in guinea pigs may be important in growth regulation, a role usually played by <a href="growth%20hormone">growth hormone</a>. Additionally, guinea pigs have been identified as <a href="model%20organism">model organism</a>s for the study of juvenile diabetes and, because of the frequency of pregnancy toxemia, of pre-eclampsia in human females. Their placental structure is similar to that of humans, and their gestation period can be divided into trimesters that resemble the stages of fetal development in humans.

Guinea pig <a href="strain%20%28biology%29">strains</a> used in scientific research are primarily outbred strains. Aside from the common American or English stock, the two main outbred strains in laboratory use are the Hartley and Dunkin-Hartley; these English strains are <a href="albinism">albino</a>, although pigmented strains are also available. <a href="Inbred%20strain">Inbred strain</a>s are less common and are usually used for very specific research, such as immune system molecular biology. Of the inbred strains that have been created, the two still used with any frequency are, following Sewall Wright's designations, "Strain 2" and "Strain 13".

Hairless breeds of guinea pigs have been used in scientific research since the 1980s, particularly for <a href="dermatology">dermatological</a> studies. A hairless and <a href="immunodeficiency">immunodeficient</a> breed was the result of a spontaneous genetic mutation in inbred laboratory strains from the Hartley stock at the <a href="Eastman%20Kodak">Eastman Kodak Company</a> in 1979. An immunocompetent hairless breed was also identified by the <a href="Institute%20Armand%20Frappier">Institute Armand Frappier</a> in 1978, and <a href="Charles%20River%20Laboratories">Charles River Laboratories</a> has reproduced this breed for research since 1982. Cavy fanciers then began acquiring hairless breeds, and the pet hairless varieties are referred to as "<a href="skinny%20pig">skinny pig</a>s".

Bee-eater

The bee-eaters are a group of <a href="near-passerine">near-passerine</a> <a href="bird">bird</a>s in the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> Meropidae containing three genera and 27 species. Most species are found in Africa and Asia, with a few in southern Europe, Australia, and New Guinea. They are characterised by richly coloured <a href="plumage">plumage</a>, slender bodies, and usually elongated central tail feathers. All have long down-turned <a href="Beak">bills</a> and medium to long wings, which may be pointed or round. Male and female plumages are usually similar.

As their name suggests, bee-eaters predominantly eat flying <a href="insect">insect</a>s, especially <a href="bee">bee</a>s and <a href="wasp">wasp</a>s, which are caught in the air by flights from an open perch. The <a href="stinger">stinger</a> is removed by repeatedly hitting and rubbing the insect on a hard surface. During this process, pressure is applied to the insect, thereby extracting most of the <a href="venom">venom</a>.

Most bee-eaters are <a href="Social%20animal">gregarious</a>. They form <a href="Bird%20colony">colonies</a>, nesting in burrows tunnelled into vertical sandy banks, often at the side of a river or in flat ground. As they mostly live in colonies, large numbers of nest holes may be seen together. The eggs are white, with typically five to the clutch. Most species are <a href="monogamy">monogamous</a>, and both parents care for the young, sometimes with assistance from related birds in the colony.

Bee-eaters may be killed by <a href="bird%20of%20prey">raptors</a>; their nests are raided by rodents and snakes, and they can carry various <a href="parasite">parasite</a>s. Some species are adversely affected by human activity or <a href="Habitat%20destruction">habitat loss</a>, but none meet the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a>'s vulnerability criteria, and all are therefore evaluated as "<a href="Least-concern%20species">least concern</a>". Their conspicuous appearance means that they have been mentioned by ancient writers and incorporated into <a href="mythology">mythology</a>.

The bee-eaters were first named as a scientific group by the French <a href="polymath">polymath</a> <a href="Constantine%20Samuel%20Rafinesque">Constantine Samuel Rafinesque-Schmaltz</a>, who created the bird subfamily Meropia for these birds in 1815. The name, now modernised as Meropidae, is derived from "Merops", the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> for "bee-eater", and the English term "bee-eater" was first recorded in 1668, referring to the European species.

The bee-eaters have been considered to be related to other families, such as the <a href="roller">roller</a>s, <a href="hoopoe">hoopoe</a> and <a href="kingfisher">kingfisher</a>s, but ancestors of those families diverged from the bee-eaters at least forty million years ago, so any relationship is not close. The scarcity of <a href="fossil">fossil</a>s is unhelpful. Bee-eater fossils from the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> (2,588,000 to 11,700 years ago) have been found in Austria, and there are <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> (from 11,700 years ago to present) specimens from Israel and Russia, but all have proved to be of the extant <a href="European%20bee-eater">European bee-eater</a>. Opinions vary as to the bee-eater's nearest relatives. In 2001, Fry considered the kingfishers to be the most likely, whereas a large study published in 2008 found that bee-eaters are <a href="sister%20group">sister</a> to all other <a href="Coraciiformes">Coraciiformes</a> (rollers, <a href="ground%20roller">ground roller</a>s, <a href="tody">todies</a>, <a href="motmot">motmot</a>s and kingfishers). A 2009 book supported Fry's contention, but then a later study in 2015 suggested that the bee-eaters are sister to the rollers. The 2008 and 2015 papers both linked the kingfishers to the New World motmots.

The bee-eaters are generally similar in appearance, although they are normally divided into three <a href="genus">genera</a>. "<a href="Nyctyornis">Nyctyornis</a>" comprises two large species with long throat feathers, the <a href="blue-bearded%20bee-eater">blue-bearded bee-eater</a> and the <a href="red-bearded%20bee-eater">red-bearded bee-eater</a>, both of which have rounded wings, a ridged <a href="culmen%20%28bird%29">culmen</a>, feathered nostrils and a relatively sluggish lifestyle. The <a href="purple-bearded%20bee-eater">purple-bearded bee-eater</a> is the sole member of "Meropogon", which is intermediate between "Nyctyornis" and the typical bee-eaters, having rounded wings and a "beard", but a smooth culmen and no nostril feathers. All the remaining species are normally retained in the single genus "<a href="Merops%20%28genus%29">Merops</a>". There are close relationships within this genus, for example the <a href="red-throated%20bee-eater">red-throated bee-eater</a> and the <a href="white-fronted%20bee-eater">white-fronted bee-eater</a> form a <a href="superspecies">superspecies</a>, but formerly suggested genera, such as "Aerops", "Melittophagus", "Bombylonax" and "Dicrocercus", have not been generally accepted for several decades since a 1969 paper united them in the current arrangement.

The bee-eater family contains the following species.


Some authorities split the green bee-eater into three species, the Asian green bee-eater, "Merops orientalis", the Arabian green bee-eater, "M. cyanophrys", and the African green bee-eater, "M. viridissimus".

A 2007 <a href="nuclear%20DNA">nuclear</a> and <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> study produced a possible <a href="phylogenetic%20tree">phylogenetic tree</a>, although the position of the purple-bearded bee-eater appears anomalous, in that it appears amongst "Merops" species.

The bee-eaters are <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphologically</a> a fairly uniform group. They share many features with related Coraciiformes such as the kingfishers and rollers, being large-headed (although less so than their relatives), short-necked, brightly plumaged and short-legged. Their wings may be rounded or pointed, with the wing shape closely correlated with the species' preferred foraging habitat and <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a> tendencies. Shorter, rounder wings are found on species that are sedentary and make typically short foraging flights in denser forests and reed-beds. Those with more elongated wings are more migratory. All the bee-eaters are highly aerial; they take off strongly from perches, fly directly without undulations, and are able to change direction quickly, although they rarely hover.

The <a href="flight%20feather">flight feather</a>s of the wing comprise 10 <a href="flight%20feather%23primaries">primaries</a>, the outermost being very small, and 13 <a href="flight%20feather%23secondaries">secondaries</a>, and there are 12 <a href="flight%20feather%23rectrices">tail feathers</a>.

The <a href="beak">bill</a>s of bee-eaters are curved, long and end in a sharp point. The bill can bite strongly, particularly at the tip, and it is used as a pair of <a href="forceps">forceps</a> with which to snatch insects from the air and crush smaller prey. The short legs have weak feet, and when it is moving on the ground a bee-eater's gait is barely more than a shuffle. The feet have sharp claws used for perching on vertical surfaces and also for nest excavation.

The <a href="plumage">plumage</a> of the family is generally very bright and in most species is mostly or at least partly green, although the two <a href="carmine%20bee-eater%20%28disambiguation%29">carmine bee-eaters</a> are mostly rose-coloured. Most of the "Merops" bee-eaters have a black bar through the eye and many have differently coloured throats and faces. The extent of the green in these species varies from almost complete in the <a href="green%20bee-eater">green bee-eater</a> to barely any green in the <a href="white-throated%20bee-eater">white-throated bee-eater</a>. Three species, from equatorial Africa, have no green at all in their plumage, the <a href="black%20bee-eater">black bee-eater</a>, the <a href="blue-headed%20bee-eater">blue-headed bee-eater</a> and the <a href="rosy%20bee-eater">rosy bee-eater</a>. Many species have elongated central tail feathers.

There is little visible <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">difference between the sexes</a> in most of the family, although in several species the <a href="Iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a> is red in the males and brown-red in the females, and in species with tail-streamers these may be slightly longer in males. Both the European and red-bearded bee-eaters have sex-based differences in their plumage colour, and the female rainbow bee-eater has shorter tail streamers than the male, which terminate in a club-shape that he lacks. There may be instances where bee-eaters are sexually <a href="dichroism">dichromatic</a> at the <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> part of the colour spectrum, which humans cannot see. A study of <a href="blue-tailed%20bee-eater">blue-tailed bee-eater</a> found that males were more colourful than females in UV light. Their overall colour was also affected by body condition, suggesting that there was a signalling component to plumage colour. Juveniles are generally similar to adults, except for the two "Nyctyornis" species, in which the young have mainly green plumage.

Bee-eaters have calls that are characteristic for each species. Most sound simple to the human ear, but show significant variability when studied in detail, carrying significant information for the birds.

The bee-eaters have an <a href="Old%20World">Old World</a> distribution, occurring from Europe to Australia. The centre of diversity of the family is Africa, although a number of species also occur in Asia. Single species occur in each of Europe, (the <a href="European%20bee-eater">European bee-eater</a>), Australia (the <a href="rainbow%20bee-eater">rainbow bee-eater</a>) and Madagascar (the <a href="olive%20bee-eater">olive bee-eater</a>, also found on mainland Africa). Of the three genera, "Merops", which has the majority of the species, occurs across the entirety of the family's distribution. "Nyctyornis" is restricted to Asia, ranging from India and southern China to the Indonesian islands of <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a> and <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a>. The genus "Meropogon" has a single species restricted to <a href="Sulawesi">Sulawesi</a> in Indonesia.

Bee-eaters are fairly indiscriminate in their choice of habitat. Their requirements are simply an elevated perch from which to watch for prey and a suitable ground substrate in which to dig their breeding burrow. Because their prey is entirely caught on the wing they are not dependent on any vegetation type. A single species, the blue-headed bee-eater, is found inside closed rainforest where it forages close to the ground in poor light in the gaps between large trees. Six other species are also closely associated with rainforest, but occur in edge habitat such as along rivers, in tree-fall gaps, off trees overhanging ravines or on emergent tree crowns above the main canopy.

Species that breed in subtropical or temperate areas of Europe, Asia and Australia are all migratory. The European bee-eaters that breed in southern Europe and Asia migrate to <a href="West%20Africa">West</a> and <a href="southern%20Africa">southern Africa</a>. Another population of the same species breeds in South Africa and Namibia; these birds move northwards after breeding. In Australia the rainbow bee-eater is migratory in the southern areas of its range, migrating to Indonesia and New Guinea, but occurs year-round in northern Australia. Several species of bee-eater, are intra-African migrants; the white-throated bee-eater, for example, breeds on the southern edge of the <a href="Sahara">Sahara</a> and winters further south in equatorial <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a>. The most unusual migration is that of the <a href="southern%20carmine%20bee-eater">southern carmine bee-eater</a>, which has a three-stage migration; after breeding in a band between Angola and Mozambique it moves south to Botswana, Namibia and South Africa before moving north to its main wintering grounds in northern Angola, Congo and Tanzania.

The bee-eaters are <a href="Diurnality">diurnal</a> (active by day), although a few species may migrate during the night if the terrain "en route" is unsuitable for stopping or if they are crossing the sea. Bee-eaters are highly social, and pairs sitting or roosting together are often so close that they touch (an <a href="individual%20distance">individual distance</a> of zero). Many species are <a href="bird%20colony">colonial</a> in the breeding season and some species are also highly gregarious when not nesting.

The social structures of the red-throated bee-eater and the white-fronted bee-eaters have been described as more complex than for any other bird species. The birds exist in colonies located on nesting cliffs, and have a stable structure all year round. These colonies typically contain five to 50 burrows, occasionally up to 200, and are composed of clans of two or three pairs, their <a href="Helpers%20at%20the%20nest">helpers</a>, and their offspring. The helpers are male offspring from a previous year. Within the colony, the males alternate between guarding their mate and attempting to make forced copulations with other females. The females in turn attempt to lay eggs in their neighbour's nests, an example of <a href="Brood%20parasite">brood parasitism</a>. Some individuals also specialise in <a href="kleptoparasitism">kleptoparasitism</a>, stealing prey collected by other colony members. The colony's daily routine is to emerge from the nesting holes or roosting branches soon after dawn, preen and sun themselves for an hour, then disperse to feed. Feeding territories are divided by clan, with each clan defending its territory from all others of the same species, including clans of the same colony. The clans return to the colony before dusk, and engage in more social behaviour before retiring for the night. Colonies are situated several hundred metres apart and have little to do with each other, although young individuals may disperse between colonies. As such these species can be thought to have four tiers of social kinship, the individual pair, the family unit, the clan and the colony as a whole.

Bee-eaters spend around 10% of their day on comfort activities. These include <a href="sun%20bathing">sunning themselves</a>, <a href="dust%20bath">dust bath</a>ing and water bathing. Sunning behaviour helps warm birds in the morning, reducing the need to use energy to raise their temperature. It also has a social aspect, as multiple birds adopt the same posture. Finally, it may help stimulate <a href="parasite">parasite</a>s in the feathers, making them easier to find and remove. Due to their hole-nesting lifestyle, bee-eaters accumulate a number of external parasites such as <a href="mite">mite</a>s and flies. Together with sunning, bouts of dust bathing (or water bathing where available), as well as rigorous <a href="preening%20%28bird%29">preening</a>, keep the feathers and skin in good health. Bathing with water involves making shallow dives into a water body and then returning to a perch to preen.

The bee-eaters are almost exclusively aerial hunters of insect prey. Prey is caught either in continuous flight or more commonly from an exposed perch from which the bee-eater watches for prey. Smaller, rounder-winged bee-eaters typically hunt from branches and twigs closer to the ground, whereas the larger species hunt from tree tops or telegraph wires. One unusual technique often used by carmine bee-eaters is to ride on the backs of <a href="bustard">bustard</a>s.

Prey can be spotted from a distance; European bee-eaters are able to spot a bee away, and blue-cheeked bee-eaters have been observed flying out to catch large wasps. Prey is approached directly or from behind. Prey that lands on the ground or on plants is usually not pursued. Small prey may be eaten on the wing, but larger items are returned to the perch where they are beaten until dead and then broken up. Insects with poisonous stings are first smacked on the branch, then, with the bird's eyes closed, rubbed to discharge the <a href="venom">venom</a> sac and <a href="stinger">stinger</a>. This behaviour is <a href="Intrinsic%20and%20extrinsic%20properties">innate</a>, as demonstrated by a juvenile bird in captivity, which performed the task when first presented with wild bees. This bird was stung on the first five tries, but by ten bees, it was as adept at handling bees as adult birds.

Bee-eaters consume a wide range of insects; beyond a few distasteful butterflies they consume almost any insect from tiny "<a href="Drosophila">Drosophila</a>" flies to large beetles and dragonflies. At some point bee-eaters have been recorded eating beetles, <a href="mayfly">mayflies</a>, <a href="stonefly">stoneflies</a>, <a href="cicada">cicada</a>s, <a href="termite">termite</a>s, <a href="Orthoptera">crickets and grasshopper</a>s, <a href="mantis">mantis</a>es, true flies and moths. For many species the dominant prey item are stinging members of the order Hymenoptera, namely <a href="wasp">wasp</a>s and <a href="bee">bee</a>s. In a survey of 20 studies the proportion of the diet made up by bees and wasps varied from 20% to 96%, with the average being 70%. Of these <a href="honeybee">honeybee</a>s can comprise a large part of the diet, as much as 89% of the overall intake. The preference for bees and wasps may have arisen because of the numerical abundance of these suitably sized insects. The <a href="Apis%20dorsata">giant honeybee</a> is a particularly commonly eaten species. These bees attempt to congregate in a mass defence against the bee-eaters. In Israel, a European bee-eater was documented attempting to eat a small bat that it had caught, which probably couldn't fit down its throat.

Like kingfishers, bee-eaters regurgitate <a href="Pellet%20%28ornithology%29">pellets</a> of undigested material, typically long black oblongs.

If an <a href="apiary">apiary</a> is set up close to a bee-eater colony, a larger number of honey bees are eaten because they are more abundant. However, studies show the bee-eaters do not intentionally fly into the apiary, rather they feed on the insects caught on pastures and meadows within a radius of from the colony, this maximum distance being reached only when there is a lack of food. Observations show that the birds actually enter the apiary only in cold and rainy periods, when the bees do not leave the hive and other insect prey are harder for the bee-eaters to detect.

Predation is more likely when the bees are queening or during peak migrations, from late March till mid-April, and in mid-September. Hives close to or under trees or overhead cables are also at increased risk as the birds pounce on flying insects from these perches.

Bee-eaters are <a href="monogamy">monogamous</a> during a nesting season, and in sedentary species, pairs may stay together for multiple years. Migratory bee-eaters may find new mates each breeding season. The courtship displays of the bee-eaters are rather unspectacular, with some calling and raising of throat and wing feathers. The exception is the performance of the white-throated bee-eater. Their "butterfly display" involves both members of a pair performing a gliding display flight with shallow wing-beats; they then perch facing each other, raising and folding their wings while calling. Most members of the family engage in courtship feeding, where the male presents prey items to the female, and such feeding can account for much, if not all, of the energy females require for egg creation.

Like almost all Coraciiformes the bee-eaters are cavity <a href="bird%20nest">nesters</a>. In the case of the bee-eaters the nests are burrows dug into the ground, either into the sides of earth cliffs or directly into level soil. Both types of nesting site are vulnerable, those on level ground are vulnerable to trampling and small predators, whereas those in cliffs, which are often the banks of rivers, are vulnerable to flash floods, which can wipe out dozens or hundreds of nests. Many species will nest either on cliffs or on level ground but prefer cliffs, although <a href="B%C3%B6hm%27s%20bee-eater">Böhm's bee-eater</a> always nests on level ground. The burrows are dug by both birds in the pair, sometimes assisted by helpers. The soil or sand is loosened with jabs of the sharp bill, then the feet are used to kick out the loose soil. It has been suggested that riverine <a href="loess">loess</a> deposits that do not crumble when excavated may be favoured by the larger bee-eaters. There may be several false starts where nests are dug partway before being abandoned; in solitary species this can give the impression of colonial living even when that is not the case. The process of nest building can take as long as twenty days to complete, during which time the bill can be blunted and shortened. Nests are generally used only for a single season and are rarely used twice by the bee-eaters, but abandoned nests may be used by other birds, snakes and bats as shelter and breeding sites.

No nesting material is used in the breeding cavity. One white egg is laid each day until the typical clutch of about five eggs is complete. <a href="egg%20incubation">Incubation</a> starts soon after the first egg is laid, with both parents sharing this duty in the day, but only the female at night. The eggs hatch in about 20 days, and the newly hatched young are blind, pink and naked. For most species, the eggs do not all hatch at the same time, so if food is in short supply only the older chicks survive. Adults and young <a href="defecation">defecate</a> in the nest, and their pellets are trodden underfoot, making the nest cavity very malodorous. The chicks are in the nest for about 30 days.

Bee-eaters may nest as single pairs, loose colonies or dense colonies. Smaller species tend to nest solitarily, while medium-sized bee-eaters have small colonies, and larger and migratory species nest in large colonies that can number in the thousands. In some instances, colonies may contain more than one species of bee-eater. In species that nest gregariously, breeding pairs may be assisted by up to five helpers, These birds may alternate between breeding themselves and helping in successive years.

Bee-eater nests may be raided by rats and snakes, and the adults are hunted by birds of prey such as the <a href="Levant%20sparrowhawk">Levant sparrowhawk</a>. The little bee-eater and red-throated bee-eaters are hosts of the <a href="greater%20honeyguide">greater honeyguide</a> and the <a href="lesser%20honeyguide">lesser honeyguide</a>, both <a href="brood%20parasite">brood parasite</a>s. The young honeyguides kill the bee-eater's chicks and destroy any eggs. The begging call of the honeyguide sounds like "two" bee-eater chicks, ensuring a good supply of food from the adult bee-eaters.

Bee-eaters may be infested by several blood-feeding <a href="fly">flies</a> of the genus "<a href="Carnus%20%28fly%29">Carnus</a>", and the biting fly "<a href="Ornithophila">Ornithophila metallica</a>". Other parasites include <a href="Mallophaga">chewing lice</a> of the genera "<a href="Meromenopon">Meromenopon</a>", "<a href="Brueeliaa">Brueeliaa</a>" and "<a href="Meropoecus">Meropoecus</a>", some of which are specialist parasites of bee-eaters, and the stickfast flea "<a href="Echidnophaga%20gallinacea">Echidnophaga gallinacea</a>". The hole-nesting lifestyle of bee-eaters means that they tend to carry a higher burden of external parasites than non-hole-nesting bird species. Bee-eaters may also be infected by <a href="protozoa">protozoa</a>n blood parasites of the genus "<a href="Haemoproteus">Haemoproteus</a>" including "<a href="Haemoproteus%20meropis">H. meropis</a>".

Fly <a href="larva">larva</a>e of the genus "<a href="Fannia%20%28genus%29">Fannia</a>" live in the nests of at least European bee-eaters, and feed on faeces and food remains. Their presence and cleaning activities appear to benefit the developing bee-eaters.

The <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) assesses species vulnerability in terms of total population and the rate of any population decline. None of the bee-eaters meet the IUCN vulnerability criteria, and all are therefore evaluated as "<a href="Least-concern%20species">Least-concern species</a>".

Open country species, which comprise the majority of bee-eaters, have mostly expanded in range as more land is converted to agriculture, but some tropical forest species have suffered declines through loss of habitat, although no species or subspecies gives serious cause for concern. There is some human persecution of bee-eaters, with nest holes being blocked, adults shot or <a href="birdlime">limed</a>, or young taken for food. More generally problematic is the unintended destruction of nests. This can occur through cattle trampling, as with the blue-headed bee-eater in Kenya, or loss of forests, with massive conversion of native forest to <a href="oil%20palm">oil palm</a> plantations in Malaysia being particularly concerning.

A study of the southern carmine bee-eater in Zimbabwe showed that it was affected by deliberate interference and persecution and loss of woodlands, and that nesting sites are lost though poor water management leading to river bank damage, dam construction and panning for gold. Colonies are becoming concentrated into the <a href="national%20park">national park</a>s and the <a href="Zambezi">Zambezi</a> Valley. The well-studied European bee-eater is trapped and shot on migration in countries bordering the <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>, an estimated 4,000–6,000 annually being killed in Cyprus alone, but with a global population of between 170,000 and 550,000 pairs even losses on that scale make little overall impact.

Bee-eaters were mentioned by ancient writers such as <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> and <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>, who both advised <a href="beekeeper">beekeeper</a>s to kill the birds. Aristotle knew that bee-eaters nested at the end of tunnels up to long and the size of their clutch. He said that nesting adults were fed by their own young, based on the observed actual help at the nest by related birds. In <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, the <a href="Thebes%2C%20Greece">Theban</a> <a href="Botres">Botres</a> was fatally struck by his father when he desecrated a ritual sacrifice of a ram to the god <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> by tasting the victim's brains. The god took pity on him, turning him into a bee-eater.

The <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>ians believed that bee-eaters had medical properties, prescribing the application of bee-eater fat to deter biting flies, and treating the eyes with the smoke from charred bee-eater legs to cure an unspecified female complaint.

In <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, the shape of the bird in flight was thought to resemble a bow, with the long bill as an arrow. This led to a <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> name meaning "<a href="Vishnu">Vishnu</a>'s bow" and an association with archer gods. <a href="Defamation">Scandalmonger</a>s were thought to be <a href="reincarnation">reincarnated</a> as bee-eaters, because of the metaphorical poison they bore in their mouths.

Depictions in classical art are rare for such striking birds. The only known Ancient Egyptian example is a relief, probably of a little green bee-eater, on a wall of Queen <a href="Hatshepsut">Hatshepsut's</a> <a href="mortuary%20temple">mortuary temple</a>, and an early <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> mural depicting blue-cheeked bee-eaters was found in the villa of <a href="Agrippina%20the%20Younger">Agrippina</a>. Bee-eaters have been depicted on the postage stamps of at least 38 countries, the European and Carmine bee-eaters being the most common subjects, with 18 and 11 countries respectively.

P. G. Wodehouse

Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse (; 15 October 188114 February 1975) was an English author and one of the most widely read <a href="humorist">humorist</a>s of the 20th century. Born in <a href="Guildford">Guildford</a>, the third son of a British magistrate based in Hong Kong, Wodehouse spent happy teenage years at <a href="Dulwich%20College">Dulwich College</a>, to which he remained devoted all his life. After leaving school, he was employed by a bank but disliked the work and turned to writing in his spare time. His early novels were mostly <a href="School%20story">school stories</a>, but he later switched to comic fiction, creating several regular characters who became familiar to the public over the years. They include the jolly gentleman of leisure <a href="Bertie%20Wooster">Bertie Wooster</a> and his sagacious valet <a href="Jeeves">Jeeves</a>; the immaculate and loquacious <a href="Psmith">Psmith</a>; <a href="Lord%20Emsworth">Lord Emsworth</a> and the <a href="Blandings%20Castle">Blandings Castle</a> set; the <a href="Oldest%20Member%20%28character%29">Oldest Member</a>, with stories about golf; and <a href="Mr%20Mulliner">Mr Mulliner</a>, with tall tales on subjects ranging from bibulous bishops to megalomaniac movie moguls.

Most of Wodehouse's fiction is set in England, although he spent much of his life in the US and used New York and Hollywood as settings for some of his novels and short stories. He wrote a series of <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> musical comedies during and after the First World War, together with <a href="Guy%20Bolton">Guy Bolton</a> and <a href="Jerome%20Kern">Jerome Kern</a>, that played an important part in the development of the American musical. He began the 1930s writing for <a href="MGM">MGM</a> in Hollywood. In a 1931 interview, his naïve revelations of incompetence and extravagance in the studios caused a furore. In the same decade, his literary career reached a new peak.

In 1934 Wodehouse moved to France for tax reasons; in 1940 he was taken prisoner at <a href="Le%20Touquet">Le Touquet</a> by the invading Germans and interned for nearly a year. After his release he made six broadcasts from German radio in Berlin to the US, which had not yet entered the war. The talks were comic and apolitical, but his broadcasting over enemy radio prompted anger and strident controversy in Britain, and a threat of prosecution. Wodehouse never returned to England. From 1947 until his death he lived in the US, taking dual British-American citizenship in 1955. He was a prolific writer throughout his life, publishing more than ninety books, forty plays, two hundred short stories and other writings between 1902 and 1974. He died in 1975, at the age of 93, in <a href="Southampton%2C%20New%20York">Southampton, New York</a>.

Wodehouse worked extensively on his books, sometimes having two or more in preparation simultaneously. He would take up to two years to build a plot and write a scenario of about thirty thousand words. After the scenario was complete he would write the story. Early in his career he would produce a novel in about three months, but he slowed in old age to around six months. He used a mixture of <a href="Edwardian%20era">Edwardian</a> slang, quotations from and allusions to numerous poets, and several literary techniques to produce a prose style that has been compared to comic poetry and musical comedy. Some critics of Wodehouse have considered his work flippant, but among his fans are former British prime ministers and many of his fellow writers.

Wodehouse was born in <a href="Guildford">Guildford</a>, Surrey, the third son of Henry Ernest Wodehouse (1845–1929), a magistrate resident in the British colony of Hong Kong, and his wife, Eleanor (1861–1941), daughter of the Rev <a href="John%20Bathurst%20Deane">John Bathurst Deane</a>. The Wodehouses, who traced their ancestry back to the 13th century, belonged to a <a href="cadet%20branch">cadet branch</a> of the family of the <a href="earls%20of%20Kimberley">earls of Kimberley</a>. Eleanor Wodehouse was also of ancient aristocratic ancestry. She was visiting her sister in Guildford when Wodehouse was born there prematurely.
The boy was baptised at the <a href="Church%20of%20St%20Nicolas%2C%20Guildford">Church of St Nicolas, Guildford</a>, and was named after his godfather, <a href="P.%20G.%20von%20Donop">Pelham von Donop</a>. Wodehouse wrote in 1957, "If you ask me to tell you frankly if I like the name Pelham Grenville Wodehouse, I must confess that I do not... I was named after a godfather, and not a thing to show for it but a small silver mug which I lost in 1897." The first name was rapidly elided to "Plum", the name by which Wodehouse became known to family and friends.

Mother and son sailed for Hong Kong, where for his first two years Wodehouse was raised by a Chinese <a href="Amah%20%28occupation%29">amah</a> (nurse), alongside his elder brothers Peveril (1877–1951) and Armine (1879–1936). When he was two, the brothers were brought to England, where they were placed under the care of an English <a href="nanny">nanny</a> in a house adjoining that of Eleanor's father and mother. The boys' parents returned to Hong Kong and became virtual strangers to their sons. Such an arrangement was then normal for middle-class families based in the colonies. The lack of parental contact, and the harsh regime of some of those "<a href="in%20loco%20parentis">in loco parentis</a>", left permanent emotional scars on many children from similar backgrounds, including the writers <a href="William%20Makepeace%20Thackeray">Thackeray</a>, <a href="Saki">Saki</a>, <a href="Rudyard%20Kipling">Kipling</a> and <a href="Hugh%20Walpole">Walpole</a>. Wodehouse was more fortunate; his nanny, Emma Roper, was strict but not unkind, and both with her and later at his different schools Wodehouse had a generally happy childhood. His recollection was that "it went like a breeze from start to finish, with everybody I met understanding me perfectly". The biographer <a href="Robert%20McCrum">Robert McCrum</a> suggests that nonetheless Wodehouse's isolation from his parents left a psychological mark, causing him to avoid emotional engagement both in life and in his works. Another biographer, <a href="Frances%20Donaldson%2C%20Baroness%20Donaldson%20of%20Kingsbridge">Frances Donaldson</a>, writes, "Deprived so early, not merely of maternal love, but of home life and even a stable background, Wodehouse consoled himself from the youngest age in an imaginary world of his own."

In 1886 the brothers were sent to a <a href="dame-school">dame-school</a> in <a href="Croydon">Croydon</a>, where they spent three years. Peveril was then found to have a "weak chest"; sea air was prescribed, and the three boys were moved to <a href="Elizabeth%20College%2C%20Guernsey">Elizabeth College</a> on the island of <a href="Guernsey">Guernsey</a>. In 1891 Wodehouse went on to <a href="Malvern%20House%20Preparatory%20School">Malvern House Preparatory School</a> in <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, which concentrated on preparing its pupils for entry to the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>. His father had planned a naval career for him, but the boy's eyesight was found to be too poor for it. He was unimpressed by the school's narrow curriculum and zealous discipline; he later parodied it in his novels, with <a href="Bertie%20Wooster">Bertie Wooster</a> recalling his early years as a pupil at a "penitentiary... with the outward guise of a prep school" called Malvern House.

Throughout their school years the brothers were sent to stay during the holidays with various uncles and aunts from both sides of the family. In the "<a href="Oxford%20Dictionary%20of%20National%20Biography">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</a>", <a href="Iain%20Sproat">Iain Sproat</a> counts twenty aunts and considers that they played an important part not only in Wodehouse's early life, but, thinly disguised, in his mature novels, as the formidable aunts who dominate the action in the Wooster, <a href="Blandings%20Castle">Blandings</a>, and other stories. The boys had fifteen uncles, four of whom were clergymen. Sproat writes that they inspired Wodehouse's "pious but fallible curates, vicars, and bishops, of which he wrote with friendly irreverence but without mockery".

At the age of twelve in 1894, to his great joy, Wodehouse was able to follow his brother Armine to <a href="Dulwich%20College">Dulwich College</a>. He was entirely at home there; Donaldson comments that Dulwich gave him, for the first time, "some continuity and a stable and ordered life." He loved the camaraderie, distinguished himself at cricket, <a href="Rugby%20union">rugby</a> and boxing, and was a good, if not consistently diligent, student. The headmaster at the time was <a href="Arthur%20Herman%20Gilkes">A. H. Gilkes</a>, a respected <a href="classicist">classicist</a>, who was a strong influence on Wodehouse. In a study of Wodehouse's works, <a href="Richard%20Usborne">Richard Usborne</a> argues that "only a writer who was himself a scholar and had had his face ground into Latin and Greek (especially <a href="Thucydides">Thucydides</a>) as a boy" could sustain the complex sequences of <a href="subordinate%20clauses">subordinate clauses</a> sometimes found in Wodehouse's comic prose.

Wodehouse's six years at Dulwich were among the happiest of his life: "To me the years between 1894 and 1900 were like heaven." In addition to his sporting achievements he was a good singer and enjoyed taking part in school concerts; his literary leanings found an outlet in editing the school magazine, "The Alleynian". For the rest of his life he remained devoted to the school. The biographer Barry Phelps writes that Wodehouse "loved the college as much as he loved anything or anybody."

Wodehouse expected to follow Armine to the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a>, but the family's finances took a turn for the worse at the crucial moment. Ernest Wodehouse had retired in 1895, and his pension was paid in <a href="rupee">rupee</a>s; fluctuation against the <a href="Pound%20sterling">pound</a> reduced its value in Britain. Wodehouse recalled, "The wolf was not actually whining at the door and there was always a little something in the kitty for the butcher and the grocer, but the finances would not run to anything in the nature of a splash". Instead of a university career, in September 1900 Wodehouse was engaged in a junior position in the London office of the <a href="The%20Hongkong%20and%20Shanghai%20Banking%20Corporation">Hongkong and Shanghai Bank</a>. He was unsuited to it and found the work baffling and uncongenial. He later wrote a humorous account of his experiences at the bank, but at the time he longed for the end of each working day, when he could return to his rented lodgings in <a href="Chelsea%2C%20London">Chelsea</a> and write. At first he concentrated, with some success, on serious articles about school sports for "<a href="Public%20School%20Magazine">Public School Magazine</a>". In November 1900 his first comic piece, "Men Who Missed Their Own Weddings", was accepted by "<a href="Tit-Bits">Tit-Bits</a>". A new magazine for boys, "<a href="The%20Captain%20%28magazine%29">The Captain</a>", provided further well-paid opportunities, and during his two years at the bank, Wodehouse had eighty pieces published in a total of nine magazines.
In 1901, with the help of a former Dulwich master, <a href="William%20Beach%20Thomas">William Beach Thomas</a>, Wodehouse secured an appointment—at first temporary and later permanent—writing for "<a href="The%20Globe%20%28London%20newspaper%29">The Globe</a>"s popular "By the Way" column. He held the post until 1909. At around the same time his first novel was published—a school story called "<a href="The%20Pothunters">The Pothunters</a>", serialised incomplete in "Public School Magazine" in early 1902, and issued in full in hardback in September. He resigned from the bank that month to devote himself to writing full-time.

Between the publication of "The Pothunters" 1902 and that of "<a href="Mike%20%28novel%29">Mike</a>" in 1909, Wodehouse wrote eight novels and co-wrote another two. The critic R. D. B. French writes that, of Wodehouse's work from this period, almost all that deserves to survive is the school fiction. Looking back in the 1950s Wodehouse viewed these as his apprentice years: "I was practically in swaddling clothes and it is extremely creditable to me that I was able to write at all."

From his boyhood Wodehouse had been fascinated by America, which he conceived of as "a land of romance"; he "yearned" to visit the country, and by 1904 he had earned enough to do so. In April he sailed to New York, which he found greatly to his liking. He noted in his diary: "In New York gathering experience. Worth many guineas in the future but none for the moment". This prediction proved correct: few British writers had first-hand experience of the US, and his articles about life in New York brought him higher than usual fees. He later recalled that "in 1904 anyone in the London writing world who had been to America was regarded with awe and looked upon as an authority on that "terra incognita"... After that trip to New York I was a man who counted... My income rose like a rocketing pheasant."

Wodehouse's other new venture in 1904 was writing for the stage. Towards the end of the year the librettist <a href="Owen%20Hall">Owen Hall</a> invited him to contribute an additional lyric for a <a href="Edwardian%20musical%20comedy">musical comedy</a> "Sergeant Brue". Wodehouse had loved theatre since his first visit, aged thirteen, when <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a>'s "<a href="Patience%20%28opera%29">Patience</a>" had made him "drunk with ecstasy". His lyric for Hall, "Put Me in My Little Cell", was a <a href="W.%20S.%20Gilbert">Gilbertian</a> number for a trio of comic crooks, with music by <a href="Frederick%20Rosse">Frederick Rosse</a>; it was well received and launched Wodehouse on a career as a theatre writer that spanned three decades.

Although it made little impact on its first publication, the 1906 novel "<a href="Love%20Among%20the%20Chickens">Love Among the Chickens</a>" contained what French calls the author's first original comic creation: <a href="Stanley%20Featherstonehaugh%20Ukridge">Stanley Featherstonehaugh Ukridge</a>. The character, an amoral, bungling opportunist, is partly based on Wodehouse's "Globe" colleague <a href="Herbert%20Westbrook">Herbert Westbrook</a>. The two collaborated between 1907 and 1913 on two books, two <a href="music%20hall">music hall</a> sketches, and a play, "Brother Alfred". Wodehouse would return to the character in short stories over the next six decades.

In early 1906 the actor-manager <a href="Seymour%20Hicks">Seymour Hicks</a> invited Wodehouse to become resident lyricist at the <a href="Aldwych%20Theatre">Aldwych Theatre</a>, to add topical verses to newly imported or long-running shows. Hicks had already recruited the young <a href="Jerome%20Kern">Jerome Kern</a> to write the music for such songs. The first Kern-Wodehouse collaboration, a comic number for "<a href="The%20Beauty%20of%20Bath">The Beauty of Bath</a>" titled "Mr <nowiki>[</nowiki><a href="Joseph%20Chamberlain">Joseph</a><nowiki>]</nowiki> Chamberlain", was a show-stopper and was briefly the most popular song in London.

Wodehouse's early period as a writer came to an end in 1908 with the serialisation of "The Lost Lambs", published the following year in book form as the second half of the novel "Mike". The work begins as a conventional school story, but Wodehouse introduces a new and strikingly original character, <a href="Psmith">Psmith</a>, whose creation both <a href="Evelyn%20Waugh">Evelyn Waugh</a> and <a href="George%20Orwell">George Orwell</a> regarded as a watershed in Wodehouse's development. Wodehouse said that he based Psmith on the hotelier and impresario <a href="Rupert%20D%27Oyly%20Carte">Rupert D'Oyly Carte</a>—"the only thing in my literary career which was handed to me on a silver plate with watercress around it". Wodehouse wrote in the 1970s that a cousin of his who had been at school with Carte told him of the latter's monocle, studied suavity, and stateliness of speech, all of which Wodehouse adopted for his new character. Psmith featured in three more novels: "<a href="Psmith%20in%20the%20City">Psmith in the City</a>" (1910), a burlesque of banking; "<a href="Psmith%2C%20Journalist">Psmith, Journalist</a>" (1915) set in New York; and "<a href="Leave%20It%20to%20Psmith">Leave It to Psmith</a>" (1923), set at Blandings Castle.

In May 1909 Wodehouse made his second visit to New York, where he sold two short stories to "<a href="Cosmopolitan%20%28magazine%29">Cosmopolitan</a>" and "<a href="Collier%27s">Collier's</a>" for a total of $500, a much higher fee than he had commanded previously. He resigned from "The Globe" and stayed in New York for nearly a year. He sold many more stories, but none of the American publications offered a permanent relationship and guaranteed income. Wodehouse returned to England in late 1910, rejoining "The Globe" and also contributing regularly to "<a href="The%20Strand%20Magazine">The Strand Magazine</a>". Between then and the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 he revisited America frequently.

Wodehouse was in New York when the war began. Ineligible for military service because of his poor eyesight, he remained in the US throughout the war, detached from the conflict in Europe and absorbed in his theatrical and literary concerns. In September 1914 he married Ethel May Wayman, "née" Newton (1885–1984), an English widow. The marriage proved happy and lifelong. Ethel's personality was in contrast with her husband's: he was shy and impractical; she was gregarious, decisive and well organised. In Sproat's phrase, she "took charge of Wodehouse's life and made certain that he had the peace and quiet he needed to write". There were no children of the marriage, but Wodehouse came to love Ethel's daughter Leonora (1905–1944) and legally adopted her.
Wodehouse experimented with different genres of fiction in these years; his "<a href="Psmith%2C%20Journalist">Psmith, Journalist</a>", mixing comedy with social comment on slum landlords and racketeers, was published in 1915. In the same year "<a href="The%20Saturday%20Evening%20Post">The Saturday Evening Post</a>" paid $3,500 to serialise "<a href="Something%20Fresh">Something New</a>", the first of what became a series of novels set at Blandings Castle. It was published in hardback in the US and the UK in the same year (the British edition being retitled "Something Fresh"). It was Wodehouse's first <a href="farce">farcical</a> novel; it was also his first best-seller, and although his later books included some gentler, lightly sentimental stories, it was as a farceur that he became known. Later in the same year "Extricating Young Gussie", the first story about Bertie and <a href="Jeeves">Jeeves</a>, was published. These stories introduced two sets of characters about whom Wodehouse wrote for the rest of his life. The Blandings Castle stories, set in an English stately home, depict the attempts of the placid <a href="Lord%20Emsworth">Lord Emsworth</a> to evade the many distractions around him, which include successive pairs of young lovers, the machinations of his exuberant brother <a href="Galahad%20Threepwood">Galahad</a>, the demands of his domineering sisters and super-efficient secretaries, and anything detrimental to his prize sow, the <a href="Empress%20of%20Blandings">Empress of Blandings</a>. The Bertie and Jeeves stories feature an amiable young man-about-town, regularly rescued from the consequences of his idiocy by the benign interference of his valet.

A third milestone in Wodehouse's life came towards the end of 1915: his old songwriting partner Jerome Kern introduced him to the writer <a href="Guy%20Bolton">Guy Bolton</a>, who became Wodehouse's closest friend and a regular collaborator. Bolton and Kern had a musical, "<a href="Very%20Good%20Eddie">Very Good Eddie</a>", running at the <a href="Princess%20Theatre%2C%20New%20York%20City">Princess Theatre</a> in New York. The show was successful, but they thought the song lyrics weak and invited Wodehouse to join them on its successor. This was "<a href="Zsuzsi%20kisasszony">Miss Springtime</a>" (1916), which ran for 227 performances—a good run by the standards of the day. The team produced several more successes, including "<a href="Leave%20It%20to%20Jane">Leave It to Jane</a>" (1917), "<a href="Oh%2C%20Boy%21%20%28musical%29">Oh, Boy!</a>" (1917–18) and "<a href="Oh%2C%20Lady%21%20Lady%21%21">Oh, Lady! Lady!!</a>" (1918), and Wodehouse and Bolton wrote a few more shows with other composers. In these musicals Wodehouse's lyrics won high praise from critics as well as fellow lyricists such as <a href="Ira%20Gershwin">Ira Gershwin</a>.

Unlike his original model, Gilbert, Wodehouse preferred the music to be written first, fitting his words into the melodies. Donaldson suggests that this is the reason why his lyrics have largely been overlooked in recent years: they fit the music perfectly, but do not stand on their own in verse form as Gilbert's do. Nonetheless, Donaldson adds, the book and lyrics for the Princess Theatre shows made the collaborators an enormous fortune and played an important part in the development of the American musical. In the "<a href="Grove%20Dictionary%20of%20Music%20and%20Musicians">Grove Dictionary of American Music</a>" Larry Stempel writes, "By presenting naturalistic stories and characters and attempting to integrate the songs and lyrics into the action of the libretto, these works brought a new level of intimacy, cohesion, and sophistication to American musical comedy." The theatre writer <a href="Gerald%20Bordman">Gerald Bordman</a> calls Wodehouse "the most observant, literate, and witty lyricist of his day". The composer <a href="Richard%20Rodgers">Richard Rodgers</a> wrote, "Before <a href="Lorenz%20Hart">Larry Hart</a>, only P.G. Wodehouse had made any real assault on the intelligence of the song-listening public."

In the years after the war, Wodehouse steadily increased his sales, polished his existing characters and introduced new ones. Bertie and Jeeves, Lord Emsworth and his circle, and Ukridge appeared in novels and short stories; Psmith made his fourth and last appearance; two new characters were the Oldest Member, narrating his series of golfing stories, and Mr Mulliner, telling his particularly tall tales to fellow patrons of the bar at the Angler's Rest. Various other young men-about-town appeared in short stories about members of the <a href="Drones%20Club">Drones Club</a>.
The Wodehouses returned to England, where they had a house in London for some years, but Wodehouse continued to cross the Atlantic frequently, spending substantial periods in New York. He continued to work in the theatre. During the 1920s he collaborated on nine musical comedies produced on Broadway or in the West End, including the long-running "<a href="Sally%20%28musical%29">Sally</a>" (1920, New York), "<a href="The%20Cabaret%20Girl">The Cabaret Girl</a>" (1922, London) and "<a href="Rosalie%20%28musical%29">Rosalie</a>" (1928, New York). He also wrote non-musical plays, including "The Play's the Thing" (1926), adapted from <a href="Ferenc%20Moln%C3%A1r">Ferenc Molnár</a>, and "A Damsel in Distress" (1928), a dramatisation of his 1919 novel.

Though never a naturally gregarious man, Wodehouse was more sociable in the 1920s than at other periods. Donaldson lists among those with whom he was on friendly terms writers including <a href="A.%20A.%20Milne">A. A. Milne</a>, <a href="Ian%20Hay">Ian Hay</a>, <a href="Frederick%20Lonsdale">Frederick Lonsdale</a> and <a href="E.%20Phillips%20Oppenheim">E. Phillips Oppenheim</a>, and stage performers including <a href="George%20Grossmith%20Jr.">George Grossmith Jr.</a>, <a href="Heather%20Thatcher">Heather Thatcher</a> and <a href="Dorothy%20Dickson">Dorothy Dickson</a>.

There had been films of Wodehouse stories since 1915, when <a href="A%20Gentleman%20of%20Leisure%20%281915%20film%29">"A Gentleman of Leisure"</a> was based on his 1910 novel of the <a href="A%20Gentleman%20of%20Leisure">same name</a>. Further screen adaptations of his books were made between then and 1927, but it was not until 1929 that Wodehouse went to Hollywood where Bolton was working as a highly paid writer for <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> (MGM). Ethel was taken with both the financial and social aspects of Hollywood life, and she negotiated a contract with MGM on her husband's behalf under which he would be paid $2,000 a week. This large salary was particularly welcome because the couple had lost considerable sums in the <a href="Wall%20Street%20Crash%20of%201929">Wall Street Crash of 1929</a>.
The contract started in May 1930, but the studio found little for Wodehouse to do, and he had spare time to write a novel and nine short stories. He commented, "It's odd how soon one comes to look on every minute as wasted that is given to earning one's salary." Even when the studio found a project for him to work on, the interventions of committees and constant rewriting by numerous contract authors meant that his ideas were rarely used. In a 2005 study of Wodehouse in Hollywood, Brian Taves writes that "<a href="Those%20Three%20French%20Girls">Those Three French Girls</a>" (1930) was "as close to a success as Wodehouse was to have at MGM. His only other credits were minimal, and the other projects he worked on were not produced."

Wodehouse's contract ended after a year and was not renewed. At MGM's request, he gave an interview to "<a href="The%20Los%20Angeles%20Times">The Los Angeles Times</a>". Wodehouse was described by <a href="Herbert%20Warren%20Wind">Herbert Warren Wind</a> as "politically naive [and] fundamentally unworldly," and he caused a sensation by saying publicly what he had already told his friends privately about Hollywood's inefficiency, arbitrary decision-making, and waste of expensive talent. The interview was reprinted in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", and there was much editorial comment about the state of the film industry. Many writers have considered that the interview precipitated a radical overhaul of the studio system, but Taves believes it to have been "a storm in a teacup", and Donaldson comments that, in the straitened post-crash era, the reforms would have been inevitable.

Wind's view of Wodehouse's naïveté is not universally held. Biographers including Donaldson, McCrum and Phelps suggest that his unworldliness was only part of a complex character, and that in some respects he was highly astute. He was unsparing of the studio owners in his early-1930s short stories set in Hollywood, which contain what Taves considers Wodehouse's sharpest and most biting satire.

During the 1930s Wodehouse's theatrical work tailed off. He wrote or adapted four plays for the West End; "Leave it to Psmith" (1930), which he adapted in collaboration with Ian Hay, was the only one to have a long run. The reviewer in "<a href="The%20Manchester%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>" praised the play, but commented: "It is Mr Wodehouse's own inimitable narrative comments and descriptions in his own person of the antics of his puppets that one misses. They cannot be got into a play and they are at least half the fun of the novels." In 1934 Wodehouse collaborated with Bolton on the book for <a href="Cole%20Porter">Cole Porter</a>'s "<a href="Anything%20Goes">Anything Goes</a>" (Porter wrote his own lyrics), but at the last minute their version was almost entirely rewritten by others at the instigation of the producer, who disliked the original script. Concentrating on writing novels and short stories, Wodehouse reached the peak of his productivity in this decade, averaging two books each year, and grossing an annual £100,000.

His practice of dividing his time between Britain and America caused Wodehouse difficulties with the tax authorities of both countries. Both the UK <a href="Inland%20Revenue">Inland Revenue</a> and the US <a href="Internal%20Revenue%20Service">Internal Revenue Service</a> sought to tax him as a resident. The matter was settled after lengthy negotiations, but the Wodehouses decided to change their residential status beyond doubt by moving to France, where they bought a house near <a href="Le%20Touquet">Le Touquet</a> in the north.

In 1935 Wodehouse created the last of his regular cast of principal characters, Lord Ickenham, otherwise known as Uncle Fred, who, in Usborne's words, "leads the dance in four novels and a short story... a whirring dynamo of misrule". His other books from the decade include "<a href="Right%20Ho%2C%20Jeeves">Right Ho, Jeeves</a>", which Donaldson judged his best work, "<a href="Uncle%20Fred%20in%20the%20Springtime">Uncle Fred in the Springtime</a>", which the writer <a href="Bernard%20Levin">Bernard Levin</a> considered the best, and "Blandings Castle", which contains "Lord Emsworth and the Girl Friend", which Rudyard Kipling thought "one of the most perfect short stories I have ever read".

Other leading literary figures who admired Wodehouse were <a href="A.%20E.%20Housman">A. E. Housman</a>, <a href="Max%20Beerbohm">Max Beerbohm</a> and <a href="Hilaire%20Belloc">Hilaire Belloc</a>; on the radio and in print Belloc called Wodehouse "the best writer of our time: the best living writer of English... the head of my profession". Wodehouse regarded Belloc's plaudit as "a gag, to get a rise out of serious-minded authors whom he disliked". Wodehouse was never sure that his books had literary merit as well as popular appeal, and, Donaldson suggests, must have been overwhelmed when the University of Oxford conferred an honorary doctorate of letters on him in June 1939. His visit to England for the awarding ceremony was the last time he set foot in his native land.

At the start of the Second World War Wodehouse and his wife remained at their Le Touquet house, where, during the <a href="Phoney%20War">Phoney War</a>, he worked on "<a href="Joy%20in%20the%20Morning%20%28Wodehouse%20novel%29">Joy in the Morning</a>". With the advance of the Germans, the nearby Royal Air Force base withdrew; Wodehouse was offered the sole spare seat in one of the fighter aircraft, but he turned down the opportunity as it would have meant leaving behind Ethel and their dog. On 21 May 1940, with German troops advancing through northern France, the Wodehouses decided to drive to Portugal and fly from there to the US. Two miles from home their car broke down, so they returned and borrowed a car from a neighbour; with the routes blocked with refugees, they returned home again.
The Germans occupied Le Touquet on 22 May 1940 and Wodehouse had to report to the authorities daily. After two months of occupation the Germans <a href="Internment">interned</a> all male enemy nationals under 60, and Wodehouse was sent to a former prison in <a href="Loos%2C%20Nord">Loos</a>, a suburb of <a href="Lille">Lille</a>, on 21 July; Ethel remained in Le Touquet. The internees were placed four to a cell, each of which had been designed for one man. One bed was available per cell, which was made available to the eldest man—not Wodehouse, who slept on the granite floor. The prisoners were not kept long in Loos before they were transported in cattle trucks to a former barracks in <a href="Li%C3%A8ge">Liège</a> which was run as a prison by the <a href="Schutzstaffel">SS</a>. After a week the men were transferred to <a href="Huy">Huy</a> in <a href="Li%C3%A8ge%20%28province%29">Liège</a>, Belgium, where they were incarcerated in the <a href="Citadel%20of%20Huy">local citadel</a>. They remained there until September 1940, when they were transported to <a href="Toszek">Tost</a> in <a href="Upper%20Silesia">Upper Silesia</a> (then Germany, now Toszek in Poland).

Wodehouse's family and friends had not had any news of his location after the fall of France, but an article from an <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> reporter who had visited Tost in December 1940 led to pressure on the German authorities to release the novelist. This included a petition from influential people in the US; Senator <a href="W.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BWarren%20Barbour">W. Warren Barbour</a> presented it to the German ambassador. Although his captors refused to release him, Wodehouse was provided with a typewriter and, to pass the time, he wrote "<a href="Money%20in%20the%20Bank%20%28novel%29">Money in the Bank</a>". Throughout his time in Tost, he sent postcards to his US literary agent asking for $5 to be sent to various people in Canada, mentioning his name. These were the families of Canadian prisoners of war, and the news from Wodehouse was the first indication that their sons were alive and well. Wodehouse risked severe punishment for the communication, but managed to evade the German censor.

On 21 June 1941, while he was in the middle of playing a game of cricket, Wodehouse received a visit from two members of the <a href="Gestapo">Gestapo</a>. He was given ten minutes to pack his things before he was taken to the <a href="Hotel%20Adlon">Hotel Adlon</a>, a top luxury hotel in Berlin. He stayed there at his own expense; royalties from the German editions of his books had been put into a special frozen bank account at the outset of the war, and Wodehouse was permitted to draw upon this money he had earned whilst staying in Berlin. He was thus released from internment a few months before his sixtieth birthday—the age at which civilian internees were released by the Nazis. Shortly afterwards Wodehouse was, in the words of Phelps, "cleverly trapped" into making five broadcasts to the US via German radio, with the Berlin-based correspondent of the <a href="CBS">Columbia Broadcasting System</a>. The broadcasts—aired on 28 June, 9, 23 and 30 July, and 6 August—were titled "How to be an Internee Without Previous Training", and comprised humorous anecdotes about Wodehouse's experiences as a prisoner, including some gentle mocking of captors. The German propaganda ministry arranged for the recordings to be broadcast to Britain in August. The day after Wodehouse recorded his final programme, Ethel joined him in Berlin, having sold most of her jewellery to pay for the journey.

The reaction in Britain to Wodehouse's broadcasts was hostile, and he was "reviled ... as a traitor, collaborator, Nazi propagandist, and a coward", although, Phelps observes, many of those who decried his actions had not heard the content of the programmes. A front-page article in "<a href="The%20Daily%20Mirror">The Daily Mirror</a>" stated that Wodehouse "lived luxuriously because Britain laughed with him, but when the laughter was out of his country's heart, ... [he] was not ready to share her suffering. He hadn't the guts ... even to stick it out in the internment camp." In the House of Commons <a href="Anthony%20Eden">Anthony Eden</a>, the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Affairs">Foreign Secretary</a>, regretted Wodehouse's actions. Several libraries removed Wodehouse novels from their shelves.
On 15 July the journalist <a href="William%20Connor">William Connor</a>, under his pen name Cassandra, broadcast a postscript to the news programme railing against Wodehouse. According to "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", the broadcast "provoked a storm of complaint ... from listeners all over the country". Wodehouse's biographer, <a href="Joseph%20Connolly%20%28author%29">Joseph Connolly</a>, thinks the broadcast "inaccurate, spiteful and slanderous"; Phelps calls it "probably the most vituperative attack on an individual ever heard on British radio". The broadcast was made at the direct instruction of <a href="Duff%20Cooper">Duff Cooper</a>, the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Information%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Minister of Information</a>, who overruled strong protests made by the BBC against the decision to air the programme. Numerous letters appeared in the British press, both supporting and criticising Wodehouse. The letters page of "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" became a focus for censuring Wodehouse, including one from Wodehouse's friend, A. A. Milne; a reply from their fellow author <a href="Compton%20Mackenzie">Compton Mackenzie</a> in defence of Wodehouse was not published because the editor claimed a lack of space. Most of those defending Wodehouse against accusations of disloyalty, including <a href="Sax%20Rohmer">Sax Rohmer</a>, <a href="Dorothy%20L.%20Sayers">Dorothy L. Sayers</a> and <a href="Gilbert%20Frankau">Gilbert Frankau</a>, conceded that he had acted stupidly. Some members of the public wrote to the newspapers to say that the full facts were not yet known and a fair judgment could not be made until they were. The management of the BBC, who considered Wodehouse's actions no worse than "ill advised", pointed out to Cooper that there was no evidence at that point whether Wodehouse had acted voluntarily or under compulsion.

When Wodehouse heard of the furore the broadcasts had caused, he contacted the Foreign Office—through the Swiss embassy in Berlin—to explain his actions, and attempted to return home via neutral countries, but the German authorities refused to let him leave. In "<a href="Performing%20Flea">Performing Flea</a>", a 1953 collection of letters, Wodehouse wrote, "Of course I ought to have had the sense to see that it was a loony thing to do to use the German radio for even the most harmless stuff, but I didn't. I suppose prison life saps the intellect". The reaction in America was mixed: the left-leaning publication "P.M." accused Wodehouse of "play[ing] Jeeves to the Nazis", but the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20War">Department of War</a> used the interviews as an ideal representation of anti-Nazi propaganda.
The Wodehouses remained in Germany until September 1943, when, because of the Allied bombings, they were allowed to move back to Paris. They were living there when the city was liberated on 25 August 1944; Wodehouse reported to the American authorities the following day, asking them to inform the British of his whereabouts. He was subsequently visited by <a href="Malcolm%20Muggeridge">Malcolm Muggeridge</a>, recently arrived in Paris as an intelligence officer with <a href="MI6">MI6</a>. The young officer quickly came to like Wodehouse and considered the question of treasonable behaviour as "ludicrous"; he summed up the writer as "ill-fitted to live in an age of ideological conflict". On 9 September Wodehouse was visited by an <a href="MI5">MI5</a> officer and former barrister, Major Edward Cussen, who formally investigated him, a process that stretched over four days. On 28 September Cussen filed his report, which states that in regard to the broadcasts, Wodehouse's behaviour "has been unwise", but advised against further action. On 23 November <a href="Theobald%20Mathew%20%28Director%20of%20Public%20Prosecutions%29">Theobald Matthew</a>, the <a href="Director%20of%20Public%20Prosecutions%20%28England%20and%20Wales%29">Director of Public Prosecutions</a>, decided there was no evidence to justify prosecuting Wodehouse.

In November 1944 Duff Cooper was appointed British ambassador to France and was provided accommodation at the <a href="H%C3%B4tel%20Le%20Bristol%20Paris">Hôtel Le Bristol</a>, where the Wodehouses were living. Cooper complained to the French authorities, and the couple were moved to a different hotel. They were subsequently arrested by French police and placed under preventive detention, despite no charges being presented. When Muggeridge tracked them down later, he managed to get Ethel released straight away and, four days later, ensured that the French authorities declared Wodehouse unwell and put him in a nearby hospital, which was more comfortable than where they had been detained. While in this hospital, Wodehouse worked on his novel "<a href="Uncle%20Dynamite">Uncle Dynamite</a>".

While still detained by the French, Wodehouse was again mentioned in questions in the House of Commons in December 1944 when MPs wondered if the French authorities could repatriate him to stand trial. Eden stated that the "matter has been gone into, and, according to the advice given, there are no grounds upon which we could take action". Two months later, Orwell wrote the essay "In Defence of P.G. Wodehouse", where he stated that "it is important to realise that the events of 1941 do not convict Wodehouse of anything worse than stupidity". Orwell's rationale was that Wodehouse's "moral outlook has remained that of a public-school boy, and according to the public-school code, treachery in time of war is the most unforgivable of all the sins", which was compounded by his "complete lack—so far as one can judge from his printed works—of political awareness".

On 15 January 1945 the French authorities released Wodehouse, but they did not inform him, until June 1946, that he would not face any official charges and was free to leave the country.

Having secured American visas in July 1946, the Wodehouses made preparations to return to New York. They were delayed by Ethel's insistence on acquiring suitable new clothes and by Wodehouse's wish to finish writing his current novel, "<a href="The%20Mating%20Season%20%28novel%29">The Mating Season</a>", in the peace of the French countryside. In April 1947 they sailed to New York, where Wodehouse was relieved at the friendly reception he received from the large press contingent awaiting his arrival. Ethel secured a comfortable penthouse apartment in <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>'s <a href="Upper%20East%20Side">Upper East Side</a>, but Wodehouse was not at ease. The New York that he had known before the war was much changed. The magazines that had paid lavishly for his stories were in decline, and those that remained were not much interested in him. He was sounded out about writing for Broadway, but he was not at home in the post-war theatre; he had money problems, with large sums temporarily tied up in Britain, and for the first time in his career he had no ideas for a new novel. He did not complete one until 1951.

Wodehouse remained unsettled until he and Ethel left New York City for suburban Long Island. Bolton and his wife lived in the prosperous hamlet of <a href="Remsenburg%2C%20New%20York">Remsenburg</a>, part of the <a href="Southampton%2C%20New%20York">Southampton</a> resort area of <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a>, east of Manhattan. Wodehouse stayed with them frequently, and in 1952 he and Ethel bought a house nearby. They lived at Remsenburg for the rest of their lives. Between 1952 and 1975 he published more than twenty novels, as well as two collections of short stories, a heavily edited collection of his letters, a volume of memoirs, and a selection of his magazine articles. He continued to hanker after a revival of his theatrical career. A 1959 off-Broadway revival of the 1917 Bolton-Wodehouse-Kern "<a href="Leave%20It%20to%20Jane">Leave It to Jane</a>" was a surprise hit, running for 928 performances, but his few post-war stage works, some in collaboration with Bolton, made little impression.

Although Ethel made a return visit to England in 1948 to shop and visit family and friends, Wodehouse never left America after his arrival in 1947. It was not until 1965 that the British government indicated privately that he could return without fear of legal proceedings, and by then he felt too old to make the journey. The biographers <a href="Benny%20Green%20%28saxophonist%29">Benny Green</a> and Robert McCrum both take the view that this exile benefited Wodehouse's writing, helping him to go on depicting an idealised England seen in his mind's eye, rather than as it actually was in the post-war decades.

In 1955 Wodehouse became an American citizen, though he remained a British subject, and was therefore still eligible for UK state honours. He was considered for the award of a <a href="knight%20bachelor">knighthood</a> three times from 1967, but the honour was twice blocked by British officials. In 1974 the British prime minister, <a href="Harold%20Wilson">Harold Wilson</a>, intervened to secure a knighthood (<a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">KBE</a>) for Wodehouse, which was announced in January 1975, in the same <a href="New%20Year%20Honours">New Year Honours</a> list in which <a href="Charlie%20Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a> became Sir Charles. "The Times" commented that Wodehouse's honour signalled "official forgiveness for his wartime indiscretion... It is late, but not too late, to take the sting out of that unhappy incident."

The following month Wodehouse entered <a href="Southampton%20Hospital">Southampton Hospital</a>, Long Island, for treatment of a skin complaint. While there, he suffered a heart attack and died on 14 February 1975 at the age of 93. He was buried at Remsenburg Presbyterian Church four days later. Ethel outlived him by more than nine years; Leonora had predeceased him, dying suddenly in 1944.

Before starting a book Wodehouse would write up to four hundred pages of notes bringing together an outline of the plot; he acknowledged that "It's the plots that I find so hard to work out. It takes such a long time to work one out." He always completed the plot before working on specific character actions. For a novel the note-writing process could take up to two years, and he would usually have two or more novels in preparation simultaneously. After he had completed his notes, he would draw up a fuller scenario of about thirty thousand words, which ensured plot holes were avoided, and allowed for the dialogue to begin to develop. When interviewed in 1975 he revealed that "For a humorous novel you've got to have a scenario, and you've got to test it so that you know where the comedy comes in, where the situations come in ... splitting it up into scenes (you can make a scene of almost anything) and have as little stuff in between as possible." He preferred working between 4 and 7 pm—but never after dinner—and would work seven days a week. In his younger years, he would write around two to three thousand words a day, although he slowed as he aged, so that in his nineties he would produce a thousand. The reduced speed in writing slowed his production of books: when younger he would produce a novel in about three months, while "<a href="Bachelors%20Anonymous">Bachelors Anonymous</a>", published in 1973, took around six months. Although studies of language production in normal healthy ageing show a marked decline from the mid 70's on, a study of Wodehouse's works did not find any evidence of a decline in linguistic ability with age.

Wodehouse believed that one of the factors that made his stories humorous was his view of life, and he stated that "If you take life fairly easily, then you take a humorous view of things. It's probably because you were born that way." He carried this view through into his writing, describing the approach as "making the thing a sort of musical comedy without music, and ignoring real life altogether". The literary critic Edward L. Galligan considers Wodehouse's stories to show his mastery in adapting the form of the American musical comedy for his writings. Wodehouse would ensure that his first draft was as carefully and accurately done as possible, correcting and refining the prose as he wrote, and would then make another good copy, before proof reading again and then making a final copy for his publisher.
Most of Wodehouse's canon is set in an undated period around the 1920s and 1930s. The critic Anthony Lejeune describes the settings of Wodehouse's novels, such as the Drones Club and Blandings Castle, as "a fairyland". Although some critics thought Wodehouse's fiction was based on a world that had never existed, Wodehouse affirmed that "it did. It was going strong between the wars", although he agreed that his version was to some extent "a sort of artificial world of my own creation". The novels showed a largely unchanging world, regardless of when they were written, and only rarely—and mistakenly in McCrum's view—did Wodehouse allow modernity to intrude, as he did in the 1966 story "Bingo Bans the Bomb".

When dealing with the dialogue in his novels, Wodehouse would consider the book's characters as if they were actors in a play, ensuring that the main roles were kept suitably employed throughout the storyline, which must be strong: "If they aren't in interesting situations, characters can't be major characters, not even if you have the rest of the troop talk their heads off about them." Many of Wodehouse's parts were stereotypes, and he acknowledged that "a real character in one of my books sticks out like a sore thumb." The publisher <a href="Michael%20Joseph%20%28publisher%29">Michael Joseph</a> identifies that even within the stereotypes Wodehouse understood human nature, and therefore "shares with [Charles] Dickens and Charles Chaplin the ability to present the comic resistance of the individual against those superior forces to which we are all subject".

Much of Wodehouse's use of slang terms reflects the influence of his time at school in Dulwich, and partly reflects <a href="Edwardian%20era">Edwardian</a> slang. As a young man he enjoyed the literary works of <a href="Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a> and <a href="Jerome%20K.%20Jerome">Jerome K. Jerome</a>, and the operatic works of Gilbert and Sullivan. Wodehouse quotes from and alludes to numerous poets throughout his work. The scholar Clarke Olney lists those quoted, including <a href="John%20Milton">Milton</a>, <a href="Lord%20Byron">Byron</a>, <a href="Henry%20Wadsworth%20Longfellow">Longfellow</a>, <a href="Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge">Coleridge</a>, <a href="Algernon%20Charles%20Swinburne">Swinburne</a>, <a href="Alfred%2C%20Lord%20Tennyson">Tennyson</a>, <a href="William%20Wordsworth">Wordsworth</a> and <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>. Another favoured source was the <a href="King%20James%20Bible">King James Bible</a>.

In 1941 the "Concise Cambridge History of English Literature" opined that Wodehouse had "a gift for highly original aptness of phrase that almost suggests a poet struggling for release among the wild extravagances of farce", while McCrum thinks that Wodehouse manages to combine "high farce with the inverted poetry of his mature comic style", particularly in "<a href="The%20Code%20of%20the%20Woosters">The Code of the Woosters</a>"; the novelist <a href="Anthony%20Powell">Anthony Powell</a> believes Wodehouse to be a "comic poet". <a href="Robert%20A.%20Hall%2C%20Jr.">Robert A. Hall, Jr.</a>, in his study of Wodehouse's style and technique, describes the author as a master of prose, an opinion also shared by Levin, who considers Wodehouse "one of the finest and purest writers of English prose". Hall identifies several techniques used by Wodehouse to achieve comic effect, including the creation of new words through adding or removing prefixes and suffixes, so when Pongo Twistleton removes the housemaid Elsie Bean from a cupboard, Wodehouse writes that the character "de-Beaned the cupboard". Wodehouse created new words by splitting others in two, thus Wodehouse divides "hobnobbing" when he writes: "To offer a housemaid a cigarette is not hobbing. Nor, when you light it for her, does that constitute nobbing."

Richard Voorhees, Wodehouse's biographer, believes that the author used clichés in a deliberate and ironic manner. His opinion is shared by the academic <a href="Stephen%20Medcalf">Stephen Medcalf</a>, who deems Wodehouse's skill is to "bring a cliché just enough to life to kill it", although Pamela March, writing in "<a href="The%20Christian%20Science%20Monitor">The Christian Science Monitor</a>", considers Wodehouse to have "an ability to decliché a cliché". Medcalf provides an example from "Right Ho, Jeeves" in which the <a href="Teetotalism">teetotal</a> <a href="Gussie%20Fink-Nottle">Gussie Fink-Nottle</a> has surreptitiously been given whisky and gin in a punch prior to a prize-giving:

<poem>
 'It seems to me, Jeeves, that the ceremony may be one fraught with considerable interest.'
'Yes, sir.'
'What, in your opinion, will the harvest be?'
'One finds it difficult to hazard a conjecture, sir.'
'You mean imagination boggles?'
'Yes, sir.'
I inspected my imagination. He was right. It boggled.
</poem>

The stylistic device most commonly found in Wodehouse's work is his use of comparative imagery that includes similes. Hall opines that the humour comes from Wodehouse's ability to accentuate "resemblances which at first glance seem highly incongruous". Examples can be seen in "Joy in the Morning", Chapter 29: "There was a sound in the background like a distant sheep coughing gently on a mountainside. Jeeves sailing into action", or "Psmith", Chapter 7: "A sound like two or three pigs feeding rather noisily in the middle of a thunderstorm interrupted his meditation." Hall also identifies that periodically Wodehouse used the stylistic device of a <a href="Hypallage">transferred epithet</a>, with an adjective that properly belongs to a person applied instead to some inanimate object. The form of expression is used sparingly by Wodehouse in comparison with other mechanisms, only once or twice in a story or novel, according to Hall.

<poem>
"I balanced a thoughtful lump of sugar on the teaspoon."
—"Joy in the Morning", Chapter 5

"As I sat in the bath-tub, soaping a meditative foot ..."
—"<a href="Jeeves%20and%20the%20Feudal%20Spirit">Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit</a>", Chapter 1

"The first thing he did was to prod Jeeves in the lower ribs with an uncouth forefinger."
—"<a href="Much%20Obliged%2C%20Jeeves">Much Obliged, Jeeves</a>", Chapter 4
</poem>

Wordplay is a key element in Wodehouse's writing. This can take the form of puns, such as in "Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit", when Bertie is released after a night in the police cells, and says that he has "a pinched look" about him. Linguistic confusion is another humorous mechanism, such as in "Uncle Dynamite" when Constable Potter says he has been "assaulted by the duck pond." In reply, Sir Aylmer, confusing the two meanings of the word "by", asks: "How the devil can you be assaulted by a duck pond?" Wodehouse also uses metaphor and mixed metaphor to add humour. Some come through exaggeration, such as <a href="Bingo%20Little">Bingo Little</a>'s infant child who "not only has the aspect of a mass murderer, but that of a mass murderer suffering from an ingrown toenail", or Wooster's complaint that "the rumpuses that <a href="Bobbie%20Wickham">Bobbie Wickham</a> is already starting may be amusing to her, but not to the unfortunate toads beneath the harrow whom she ruthlessly plunges into the soup." Bertie Wooster's half-forgotten vocabulary also provides a further humorous device. In "Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit" Bertie asks Jeeves "Let a plugugly like young Thos loose in the community with a cosh, and you are inviting disaster and ... what's the word? Something about cats." Jeeves replies, "Cataclysms, sir?"

Wodehouse's early career as a lyricist and playwright was profitable, and his work with Bolton, according to "The Guardian", "was one of the most successful in the history of musical comedy". At the outbreak of the Second World War he was earning £40,000 a year from his work, which had broadened to include novels and short stories. Following the furore ensuing from the wartime broadcasts, he suffered a downturn in his popularity and book sales; "The Saturday Evening Post" stopped publishing his short stories, a stance they reversed in 1965, although his popularity—and the sales figures—slowly recovered over time.
Wodehouse received great praise from many of his contemporaries, including Max Beerbohm, Rudyard Kipling, A. E. Housman and Evelyn Waugh—the last of whom opines, "One has to regard a man as a Master who can produce on average three uniquely brilliant and entirely original similes on each page." There are dissenters to the praise. The writer <a href="Alan%20Bennett">Alan Bennett</a> thinks that "inspired though his language is, I can never take more than ten pages of the novels at a time, their relentless flippancy wearing and tedious", while the literary critic <a href="Q.%20D.%20Leavis">Q. D. Leavis</a> writes that Wodehouse had a "stereotyped humour ... of ingenious variations on a laugh in one place". In a 2010 study of Wodehouse's few relatively serious novels, such as "The Coming of Bill" (1919), "Jill the Reckless" (1920) and "The Adventures of Sally" (1922), David Heddendorf concludes that though their literary quality does not match that of the farcical novels, they show a range of empathy and interests that in real life—and in his most comic works—the author seemed to lack. "Never oblivious to grief and despair, he opts in clear-eyed awareness for his timeless world of spats and woolly-headed peers. It's an austere, almost bloodless preference for pristine artifice over the pain and messy outcomes of actual existence, but it's a case of Wodehouse keeping faith with his own unique art."

The American literary analyst Robert F. Kiernan, defining "camp" as "excessive stylization of whatever kind", brackets Wodehouse as "a master of the camp novel", along with <a href="Thomas%20Love%20Peacock">Thomas Love Peacock</a>, <a href="Max%20Beerbohm">Max Beerbohm</a>, <a href="Ronald%20Firbank">Ronald Firbank</a>, <a href="E.%20F.%20Benson">E. F. Benson</a> and <a href="Ivy%20Compton-Burnett">Ivy Compton-Burnett</a>. The literary critic and writer <a href="Cyril%20Connolly">Cyril Connolly</a> calls Wodehouse a "politicians' author"—one who does "not like art to be exacting and difficult". Two former British prime ministers, <a href="H.%20H.%20Asquith">H. H. Asquith</a> and <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a>, are on record as Wodehouse aficionados, and the latter became a patron of the Wodehouse Society. <a href="Se%C3%A1n%20O%27Casey">Seán O'Casey</a>, a successful playwright of the 1920s, thought little of Wodehouse; he commented in 1941 that it was damaging to England's dignity that the public or "the academic government of Oxford, dead from the chin up" considered Wodehouse an important figure in English literature. His jibe that Wodehouse was "English literature's performing flea" provided his target with the title of his collected letters, published in 1953.

The proposed nominations of Wodehouse for a <a href="knighthood">knighthood</a> in 1967 and 1971 were blocked for fear that such an award would "revive the controversy of his wartime behaviour and give currency to a Bertie Wooster image of the British character which the embassy was doing its best to eradicate". When Wodehouse was awarded the knighthood, only four years later, the journalist <a href="Dennis%20Barker">Dennis Barker</a> wrote in "The Guardian" that the writer was "the solitary surviving English literary comic genius". After his death six weeks later, the journalist <a href="Michael%20Davie">Michael Davie</a>, writing in the same paper, observed that "Many people regarded ... [Wodehouse] as he regarded <a href="Beachcomber%20%28pen%20name%29">Beachcomber</a>, as 'one, if not more than one, of England's greatest men'", while in the view of the obituarist for "The Times" Wodehouse "was a comic genius recognized in his lifetime as a classic and an old master of farce".

Since Wodehouse's death there have been numerous adaptations and dramatisations of his work on television and film, and, 2015, the "<a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>" contains over 1,750 quotations from Wodehouse, illustrating terms from "crispish" to "zippiness". McCrum, writing in 2004, observes, "Wodehouse is more popular today than on the day he died", and "his comic vision has an absolutely secure place in the English literary imagination." Voorhees, while acknowledging that Wodehouse's antecedents in literature range from <a href="Ben%20Jonson">Ben Jonson</a> to <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a>, writes:

In October 2018 it was announced that Wodehouse would be commemorated with a memorial stone in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>.

Evelyn Waugh

Arthur Evelyn St. John Waugh (; 28 October 1903 – 10 April 1966) was an English writer of novels, biographies, and travel books, and he was also a prolific journalist and book reviewer. His most famous works include the early satires "<a href="Decline%20and%20Fall">Decline and Fall</a>" (1928) and "<a href="A%20Handful%20of%20Dust">A Handful of Dust</a>" (1934), the novel "<a href="Brideshead%20Revisited">Brideshead Revisited</a>" (1945), and the Second World War trilogy "<a href="Sword%20of%20Honour">Sword of Honour</a>" (1952–61). He is recognised as one of the great prose stylists of the English language in the 20th century.

Waugh was the son of a publisher, educated at <a href="Lancing%20College">Lancing College</a> and then at <a href="Hertford%20College%2C%20Oxford">Hertford College, Oxford</a>. He worked briefly as a schoolmaster before he became a full-time writer. As a young man, he acquired many fashionable and aristocratic friends and developed a taste for <a href="country%20house">country house</a> society. He travelled extensively in the 1930s, often as a special newspaper correspondent; he reported from <a href="Ethiopian%20Empire">Abyssinia</a> at the time of the <a href="Second%20Italo-Ethiopian%20War">1935 Italian invasion</a>. He served in the British armed forces throughout the Second World War, first in the <a href="Royal%20Marines">Royal Marines</a> and then in the <a href="Royal%20Horse%20Guards">Royal Horse Guards</a>. He was a perceptive writer who used the experiences and the wide range of people whom he encountered in his works of fiction, generally to humorous effect. Waugh's detachment was such that he fictionalised his own mental breakdown which occurred in the early 1950s.

Waugh converted to <a href="Catholicism">Catholicism</a> in 1930 after his first marriage failed. His traditionalist stance led him to strongly oppose all attempts to reform the Church, and the changes by the <a href="Second%20Vatican%20Council">Second Vatican Council</a> (1962–65) greatly disturbed his sensibilities, especially the introduction of the vernacular <a href="Mass%20in%20the%20Catholic%20Church">Mass</a>. That blow to his religious traditionalism, his dislike for the <a href="welfare%20state">welfare state</a> culture of the postwar world, and the decline of his health all darkened his final years, but he continued to write. He displayed to the world a mask of indifference, but he was capable of great kindness to those whom he considered his friends. After his death in 1966 he acquired a following of new readers through the film and television versions of his works, such as the television serial "<a href="Brideshead%20Revisited%20%28TV%20serial%29">Brideshead Revisited</a>" (1981).

Arthur Evelyn St. John Waugh was born on 28 October 1903 to <a href="Arthur%20Waugh">Arthur Waugh</a> (1866–1943) and Catherine Charlotte Raban (1870–1954), into a family with English, Scottish, Welsh, Irish and <a href="Huguenot">Huguenot</a> origins. Distinguished forebears include <a href="Henry%20Cockburn%2C%20Lord%20Cockburn">Lord Cockburn</a> (1779–1854), a leading Scottish advocate and judge, <a href="William%20Morgan%20%28actuary%29">William Morgan</a> (1750–1833), a pioneer of <a href="actuarial%20science">actuarial science</a> who served <a href="the%20Equitable%20Life%20Assurance%20Society">the Equitable Life Assurance Society</a> for 56 years, and <a href="Philip%20Henry%20Gosse">Philip Henry Gosse</a> (1810–1888), a natural scientist who became notorious through his depiction as a religious fanatic in his son <a href="Edmund%20Gosse">Edmund's</a> memoir "<a href="Father%20and%20Son%20%28book%29">Father and Son</a>". Among ancestors bearing the Waugh name, the Rev. Alexander Waugh (1754–1827) was a minister in the <a href="United%20Secession%20Church">Secession Church of Scotland</a> who helped found the <a href="London%20Missionary%20Society">London Missionary Society</a> and was one of the leading <a href="Nonconformist">Nonconformist</a> preachers of his day. His grandson Alexander Waugh (1840–1906) was a country medical practitioner, who bullied his wife and children and became known in the Waugh family as "the Brute". The elder of his two sons, born in 1866, was <a href="Arthur%20Waugh">Arthur Waugh</a>.

After attending <a href="Sherborne%20School">Sherborne School</a> and <a href="New%20College%2C%20Oxford">New College, Oxford</a>, Arthur Waugh began a career in publishing and as a <a href="literary%20critic">literary critic</a>. In 1902 he became managing director of <a href="Chapman%20and%20Hall">Chapman and Hall</a>, publishers of the works of <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>. He had married Catherine Raban (1870–1954) in 1893; their first son <a href="Alec%20Waugh">Alexander Raban Waugh</a> (always known as Alec) was born on 8 July 1898. Alec Waugh later became a novelist of note. At the time of his birth the family were living in <a href="North%20London">North London</a>, at Hillfield Road, <a href="West%20Hampstead">West Hampstead</a> where, on 28 October 1903, the couple's second son was born, "in great haste before Dr Andrews could arrive", Catherine recorded. On 7 January 1904 the boy was christened Arthur Evelyn St John Waugh but was known in the family and in the wider world as Evelyn.

In 1907, the Waugh family left Hillfield Road for Underhill, a house which Arthur had built in North End Road, <a href="Hampstead">Hampstead</a>, close to <a href="Golders%20Green">Golders Green</a>, then a semi-rural area of dairy farms, market gardens and bluebell woods. Evelyn received his first school lessons at home, from his mother, with whom he formed a particularly close relationship; his father, Arthur Waugh, was a more distant figure, whose close bond with his elder son, Alec, was such that Evelyn often felt excluded. In September 1910, Evelyn began as a day pupil at <a href="Heath%20Mount%20School">Heath Mount</a> preparatory school. By then, he was a lively boy of many interests, who already had written and completed "The Curse of the Horse Race", his first story. Waugh spent six relatively contented years at Heath Mount; on his own assertion he was "quite a clever little boy", who was seldom distressed or overawed by his lessons. A positive influence on his writing was an English master, Aubrey Ensor. L Physically pugnacious, Evelyn was inclined to bully weaker boys; among his victims was the future society photographer <a href="Cecil%20Beaton">Cecil Beaton</a>, who never forgot the experience.

Outside school, he and other neighbourhood children performed plays, usually written by Waugh. On the basis of the xenophobia fostered by the genre books of <a href="Invasion%20literature">Invasion literature</a>, that the Germans were about to invade Britain, Waugh organised his friends into the "Pistol Troop", who built a fort, went on manœuvres and paraded in makeshift uniforms. In 1914, after the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> began, Waugh and other boys from the Boy Scout Troop of Heath Mount School were sometimes employed as messengers at the <a href="War%20Office">War Office</a>; Evelyn loitered about the War Office in hope of glimpsing <a href="Horatio%20Kitchener%2C%201st%20Earl%20Kitchener">Lord Kitchener</a>, but never did.

Family holidays usually were spent with the Waugh aunts, at <a href="Midsomer%20Norton">Midsomer Norton</a>, in a house lit with oil lamps, a time that Waugh recalled with delight, many years later. At Midsomer Norton, Evelyn became deeply interested in <a href="High%20church">high Anglican</a> church rituals, the initial stirrings of the spiritual dimension that later dominated his perspective of life, and he served as an <a href="altar%20boy">altar boy</a> at the local Anglican church. During his last year at Heath Mount, Waugh established and edited "The Cynic" school magazine.

Like his father before him, Alec Waugh went to school at Sherborne, and, it was presumed by the family that Evelyn would follow, but in 1915, the school asked Evelyn's older brother Alec to leave, after a <a href="homosexual">homosexual</a> relationship came to light. Alec departed Sherborne for military training as an <a href="Military%20officer">officer</a>, and, while awaiting confirmation of his <a href="Commission%20%28document%29">commission</a>, wrote "The Loom of Youth" (1917), a novel of school life, which alluded to homosexual friendships at a school that was recognisably Sherborne. The public sensation caused by Alec's novel so offended the school that it became impossible for Evelyn to go there. In May 1917, much to his annoyance, he was sent to <a href="Lancing%20College">Lancing College</a>, in his opinion, a decidedly inferior school.

Waugh soon overcame his initial aversion to Lancing, settled in and established his reputation as an <a href="aesthete">aesthete</a>. In November 1917 his essay "In Defence of Cubism" (1917) was accepted by and published in the arts magazine "Drawing and Design"; it was his first published article. Within the school, he became mildly subversive, mocking the school's cadet corps and founding the Corpse Club "for those who were bored stiff". The end of the war saw the return to the school of younger masters such as <a href="J.%20F.%20Roxburgh">J. F. Roxburgh</a>, who encouraged Waugh to write and predicted a great future for him. Another mentor, Francis Crease, taught Waugh the arts of <a href="calligraphy">calligraphy</a> and decorative design; some of the boy's work was good enough to be used by Chapman and Hall on book jackets.

In his later years at Lancing, Waugh achieved success as a house captain, editor of the school magazine and president of the <a href="debating%20society">debating society</a>, and won numerous art and literature prizes. He also shed most of his religious beliefs. He started a novel of school life, untitled, but abandoned the effort after writing around 5,000 words. He ended his schooldays by winning a scholarship to read Modern History at <a href="Hertford%20College%2C%20Oxford">Hertford College, Oxford</a>, and left Lancing in December 1921.

Waugh arrived in Oxford in January 1922. He was soon writing to old friends at Lancing about the pleasures of his new life; he informed <a href="Tom%20Driberg">Tom Driberg</a>: "I do no work here and never go to Chapel". During his first two terms, he generally followed convention; he smoked a pipe, bought a bicycle, and gave his maiden speech at the <a href="Oxford%20Union">Oxford Union</a>, opposing the motion that "This House would welcome Prohibition". Waugh wrote reports on Union debates for both Oxford magazines, "<a href="Cherwell%20%28newspaper%29">Cherwell</a>" and "<a href="Isis%20magazine">Isis</a>", and he acted as a film critic for "Isis". He also became secretary of the Hertford College debating society, "an onerous but not honorific post", he told Driberg. Although Waugh tended to regard his scholarship as a reward for past efforts rather than a stepping-stone to future academic success, he did sufficient work in his first two terms to pass his "History Previous", an essential preliminary examination.

The arrival in Oxford in October 1922 of the sophisticated <a href="Old%20Etonians">Etonians</a> <a href="Harold%20Acton">Harold Acton</a> and <a href="Brian%20Howard%20%28poet%29">Brian Howard</a> changed Waugh's Oxford life. Acton and Howard rapidly became the centre of an <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> circle known as the <a href="Hypocrites%27%20Club">Hypocrites' Club</a> (Waugh was the secretary of the club), whose artistic, social and homosexual values Waugh adopted enthusiastically; he later wrote: "It was the stamping ground of half my Oxford life". He began drinking heavily, and embarked on the first of several homosexual relationships, the most lasting of which were with <a href="Richard%20Pares">Richard Pares</a> and <a href="Alastair%20Hugh%20Graham">Alastair Graham</a>. He continued to write reviews and short stories for the university journals, and developed a reputation as a talented graphic artist, but formal study largely ceased. This neglect led to a bitter feud between Waugh and his history tutor, <a href="C.%20R.%20M.%20F.%20Cruttwell">C. R. M. F. Cruttwell</a>, dean (and later principal) of Hertford College. When Cruttwell advised him to mend his ways, Waugh responded in a manner which, he admitted later, was "fatuously haughty", from then on, relations between the two descended into mutual hatred. Waugh continued the feud long after his Oxford days by using Cruttwell's name in his early novels for a succession of ludicrous, ignominious or odious minor characters.

Waugh's dissipated lifestyle continued into his final Oxford year, 1924. A letter written that year to a Lancing friend, <a href="Dudley%20Carew">Dudley Carew</a>, hints at severe emotional pressures: "I have been living very intensely these last three weeks. For the last fortnight I have been nearly insane... I may perhaps one day in a later time tell you some of the things that have happened". He did just enough work to pass his final examinations in the summer of 1924 with a third-class. However, as he had begun at Hertford in the second term of the 1921–22 academic year, Waugh had completed only eight terms' residence when he sat his finals, rather than the nine required under the university's statutes. His poor results led to the loss of his scholarship, which made it impossible for him to return to Oxford for that final term, so he left without his degree.

Back at home, Waugh began a novel, "<a href="The%20Temple%20at%20Thatch">The Temple at Thatch</a>", and worked with some of his fellow Hypocrites on a film, "The Scarlet Woman", which was shot partly in the gardens at Underhill. He spent much of the rest of the summer in the company of Alastair Graham; after Graham departed for <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a>, Waugh enrolled for the autumn at a London art school, <a href="Heatherley%20School%20of%20Fine%20Art">Heatherley's</a>.

Waugh began at Heatherley's in late September 1924, but became bored with the routine and quickly abandoned his course. He spent weeks partying in London and Oxford before the overriding need for money led him to apply through an agency for a teaching job. Almost at once, he secured a post at Arnold House, a boys' preparatory school in <a href="North%20Wales">North Wales</a>, beginning in January 1925. He took with him the notes for his novel, "The Temple at Thatch", intending to work on it in his spare time. Despite the gloomy ambience of the school, Waugh did his best to fulfil the requirements of his position, but a brief return to London and Oxford during the Easter holiday only exacerbated his sense of isolation.

In the summer of 1925, Waugh's outlook briefly improved, with the prospect of a job in <a href="Pisa">Pisa</a>, Italy, as secretary to the Scottish writer <a href="Charles%20Kenneth%20Scott%20Moncrieff">Charles Kenneth Scott Moncrieff</a>, who was engaged on the English translations of <a href="Marcel%20Proust">Marcel Proust</a>'s works. Believing that the job was his, Waugh resigned his position at Arnold House. He had meantime sent the early chapters of his novel to Acton for assessment and criticism. Acton's reply was so coolly dismissive that Waugh immediately burnt his manuscript; shortly afterwards, before he left <a href="North%20Wales">North Wales</a>, he learned that the Moncrieff job had fallen through. The twin blows were sufficient for him to consider suicide. He records that he went down to a nearby beach and, leaving a note with his clothes, walked out to sea. An attack by jellyfish changed his mind, and he returned quickly to the shore.

During the following two years Waugh taught at schools in <a href="Aston%20Clinton">Aston Clinton</a> (from which he was dismissed for the attempted drunken seduction of a school matron) and <a href="Notting%20Hill">Notting Hill</a> in London. He considered alternative careers in printing or cabinet-making, and attended evening classes in carpentry at Holborn Polytechnic while continuing to write. A short story, "The Balance", written in an experimental <a href="modernist%20literature">modernist</a> style, became his first commercially published fiction, when it was included by Chapman and Hall in a 1926 anthology, "Georgian Stories". An extended essay on the <a href="Pre-Raphaelite%20Brotherhood">Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood</a> was printed privately by Alastair Graham, using by agreement the press of the <a href="Shakespeare%20Head%20Press">Shakespeare Head Press</a> in <a href="Stratford-upon-Avon">Stratford-upon-Avon</a>, where he was undergoing training as a printer. This led to a contract from the publishers <a href="Gerald%20Duckworth%20and%20Company">Duckworths</a> for a full-length biography of <a href="Dante%20Gabriel%20Rossetti">Dante Gabriel Rossetti</a>, which Waugh wrote during 1927. He also began working on a <a href="comic%20novel">comic novel</a>; after several temporary working titles this became "<a href="Decline%20and%20Fall">Decline and Fall</a>". Having given up teaching, he had no regular employment except for a short, unsuccessful stint as a reporter on the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>" in April–May 1927. That year he met (possibly through his brother <a href="Alec%20Waugh">Alec</a>) and fell in love with <a href="Evelyn%20Gardner">Evelyn Gardner</a>, the daughter of <a href="Herbert%20Gardner%2C%201st%20Baron%20Burghclere">Lord and Lady Burghclere</a>.

In December 1927, Waugh and Evelyn Gardner became engaged, despite the opposition of Lady Burghclere, who felt that Waugh lacked moral fibre and kept unsuitable company. Among their friends, they quickly became known as "He-Evelyn" and "She-Evelyn". Waugh was at this time dependent on a £4-a-week allowance from his father and the small sums he could earn from book reviewing and journalism. The Rossetti biography was published to a generally favourable reception in April 1928: <a href="J.%20C.%20Squire">J. C. Squire</a> in "The Observer" praised the book's elegance and wit; Acton gave cautious approval; and the novelist <a href="Rebecca%20West">Rebecca West</a> wrote to express how much she had enjoyed the book. Less pleasing to Waugh was the "<a href="Times%20Literary%20Supplement">Times Literary Supplement</a>"s references to him as "Miss Waugh".

When "Decline and Fall" was completed, Duckworths objected to its "obscenity", but Chapman and Hall agreed to publish it. This was sufficient for Waugh and Gardner to bring forward their wedding plans. They were married in St Paul's Church, Portman Square, on 27 June 1928, with only Acton, Alec Waugh and the bride's friend <a href="Lady%20Pansy%20Lamb">Pansy Pakenham</a> present. The couple made their home in a small flat in Canonbury Square, <a href="Islington">Islington</a>. The first months of the marriage were overshadowed by a lack of money, and by Gardner's poor health, which persisted into the autumn.

In September 1928, "Decline and Fall" was published to almost unanimous praise. By December, the book was into its third printing, and the American publishing rights were sold for $500. In the afterglow of his success, Waugh was commissioned to write travel articles in return for a free <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a> cruise, which he and Gardner began in February 1929, as an extended, delayed honeymoon. The trip was disrupted when Gardner contracted <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> and was carried ashore to the British hospital in <a href="Port%20Said">Port Said</a>. The couple returned home in June, after her recovery. A month later, without warning, Gardner confessed that their mutual friend, <a href="John%20Heygate">John Heygate</a>, had become her lover. After an attempted reconciliation failed, a shocked and dismayed Waugh filed for divorce on 3 September 1929. The couple apparently met again only once, during the process for the <a href="annulment">annulment</a> of their marriage a few years later.

Waugh's first biographer, <a href="Christopher%20Sykes%20%28author%29">Christopher Sykes</a>, records that after the divorce friends "saw, or believed they saw, a new hardness and bitterness" in Waugh's outlook. Nevertheless, despite a letter to Acton in which he wrote that he "did not know it was possible to be so miserable and live", he soon resumed his professional and social life. He finished his second novel, "<a href="Vile%20Bodies">Vile Bodies</a>", and wrote articles including (ironically, he thought) one for the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" on the meaning of the marriage ceremony. During this period Waugh began the practice of staying at the various houses of his friends; he was to have no settled home for the next eight years.

"Vile Bodies", a satire on the <a href="Bright%20Young%20People">Bright Young People</a> of the 1920s, was published on 19 January 1930 and was Waugh's first major commercial success. Despite its quasi-biblical title, the book is dark, bitter, "a manifesto of disillusionment", according to biographer Martin Stannard. As a best-selling author Waugh could now command larger fees for his journalism. Amid regular work for "<a href="The%20Graphic">The Graphic</a>", "<a href="Town%20and%20Country%20%28magazine%29">Town and Country</a>" and "<a href="Harper%27s%20Bazaar">Harper's Bazaar</a>", he quickly wrote "Labels", a detached account of his honeymoon cruise with She-Evelyn.

On 29 September 1930, Waugh was received into the Catholic Church. This shocked his family and surprised some of his friends, but he had contemplated the step for some time. He had lost his Anglicanism at Lancing and had led an irreligious life at Oxford, but there are references in his diaries from the mid-1920s to religious discussion and regular churchgoing. On 22 December 1925, Waugh wrote: "Claud and I took Audrey to supper and sat up until 7 in the morning arguing about the Roman Church". The entry for 20 February 1927 includes, "I am to visit a Father Underhill about being a parson". Throughout the period, Waugh was influenced by his friend Olivia Plunket-Greene, who had converted in 1925 and of whom Waugh later wrote, "She bullied me into the Church". It was she who led him to Father <a href="Martin%20D%27Arcy">Martin D'Arcy</a>, a <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Jesuit</a>, who persuaded Waugh "on firm intellectual convictions but little emotion" that "the Christian revelation was genuine". In 1949, Waugh explained that his conversion followed his realisation that life was "unintelligible and unendurable without God".

On 10 October 1930, Waugh, representing several newspapers, departed for <a href="Ethiopian%20Empire">Abyssinia</a> to cover the coronation of <a href="Haile%20Selassie">Haile Selassie</a>. He reported the event as "an elaborate propaganda effort" to convince the world that Abyssinia was a civilised nation that concealed that the emperor had achieved power through barbarous means. A subsequent journey through the <a href="British%20East%20Africa">British East Africa</a> colonies and the <a href="Belgian%20Congo">Belgian Congo</a> formed the basis of two books; the travelogue "Remote People" (1931) and the comic novel "<a href="Black%20Mischief">Black Mischief</a>" (1932). Waugh's next extended trip, in the winter of 1932–1933, was to <a href="Guyana">British Guiana</a> (now Guyana) in South America, possibly taken to distract him from a long and unrequited passion for the socialite <a href="Teresa%20Jungman">Teresa Jungman</a>. On arrival in <a href="Georgetown%2C%20Guyana">Georgetown</a>, Waugh arranged a river trip by steam launch into the interior. He travelled on via several staging-posts to <a href="Boa%20Vista%2C%20Roraima">Boa Vista</a> in Brazil, and then took a convoluted overland journey back to Georgetown. His various adventures and encounters found their way into two further books: his travel account "Ninety-two Days", and the novel "<a href="A%20Handful%20of%20Dust">A Handful of Dust</a>", both published in 1934.

Back from South America, Waugh faced accusations of obscenity and <a href="blasphemy">blasphemy</a> from the Catholic journal "<a href="The%20Tablet">The Tablet</a>", which objected to passages in "Black Mischief". He defended himself in an open letter to the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Westminster">Archbishop of Westminster</a>, Cardinal <a href="Francis%20Bourne">Francis Bourne</a>, which remained unpublished until 1980. In the summer of 1934, he went on an expedition to <a href="Spitsbergen">Spitsbergen</a> in the <a href="Arctic">Arctic</a>, an experience he did not enjoy and of which he made minimal literary use. On his return, determined to write a major Catholic biography, he selected the <a href="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> martyr <a href="Edmund%20Campion">Edmund Campion</a> as his subject. The book, published in 1935, caused controversy by its forthright pro-Catholic, anti-<a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> stance but brought its writer the <a href="Hawthornden%20Prize">Hawthornden Prize</a>. He returned to Abyssinia in August 1935 to report the opening stages of the <a href="Second%20Italo-Abyssinian%20War">Second Italo-Abyssinian War</a> for the "Daily Mail". Waugh, on the basis of his earlier visit, considered Abyssinia "a savage place which <a href="Mussolini">Mussolini</a> was doing well to tame" according to his fellow reporter, <a href="Bill%20Deedes">William Deedes</a>. Waugh saw little action and was not wholly serious in his role as a war correspondent. Deedes remarks on the older writer's snobbery: "None of us quite measured up to the company he liked to keep back at home". However, in the face of imminent Italian air attacks, Deedes found Waugh's courage "deeply reassuring". Waugh wrote up his Abyssinian experiences in a book, "Waugh in Abyssinia" (1936), which <a href="Rose%20Macaulay">Rose Macaulay</a> dismissed as a "fascist tract" on account of its pro-Italian tone. A better-known account is his novel "<a href="Scoop%20%28novel%29">Scoop</a>" (1938) in which the protagonist, William Boot, is loosely based on Deedes.

Among Waugh's growing circle of friends were <a href="Diana%20Mitford">Diana Guinness</a> and <a href="Bryan%20Guinness%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Moyne">Bryan Guinness</a> (dedicatees of "<a href="Vile%20Bodies">Vile Bodies</a>"), <a href="Lady%20Diana%20Cooper">Lady Diana Cooper</a> and her husband <a href="Duff%20Cooper">Duff Cooper</a>, <a href="Nancy%20Mitford">Nancy Mitford</a> who was originally a friend of Evelyn Gardner's, and the <a href="Earl%20Beauchamp">Lygon sisters</a>. Waugh had known <a href="Hugh%20Patrick%20Lygon">Hugh Patrick Lygon</a> at Oxford; now he was introduced to the girls and their country house, <a href="Madresfield%20Court">Madresfield Court</a>, which became the closest that he had to a home during his years of wandering. In 1933, on a Greek islands cruise, he was introduced by Father D'Arcy to Gabriel Herbert, eldest daughter of the late explorer <a href="Aubrey%20Herbert">Aubrey Herbert</a>. When the cruise ended Waugh was invited to stay at the Herbert family's villa in <a href="Portofino">Portofino</a>, where he first met Gabriel's 17-year-old sister, Laura.

On his conversion, Waugh had accepted that he would be unable to remarry while Evelyn Gardner was alive. However, he wanted a wife and children, and in October 1933, he began proceedings for the <a href="Annulment%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">annulment</a> of the marriage on the grounds of "lack of real consent". The case was heard by an <a href="Ecclesiastical%20court">ecclesiastical tribunal</a> in London, but a delay in the submission of the papers to Rome meant that the annulment was not granted until 4 July 1936. In the meantime, following their initial encounter in Portofino, Waugh had fallen in love with Laura Herbert. He proposed marriage, by letter, in spring 1936. There were initial misgivings from the <a href="Herbert%20family">Herberts</a>, an aristocratic Catholic family; as a further complication, Laura Herbert was a cousin of Evelyn Gardner. Despite some family hostility the marriage took place on 17 April 1937 at the <a href="Church%20of%20our%20Lady%20of%20the%20Assumption%20and%20St%20Gregory%2C%20Westminster">Church of the Assumption</a> in Warwick Street, London.

As a wedding present the bride's grandmother bought the couple Piers Court, a country house near <a href="Stinchcombe%2C%20Gloucestershire">Stinchcombe</a> in Gloucestershire. The couple had seven children, one of whom died in infancy. Their first child, a daughter, Maria Teresa, was born on 9 March 1938 and a son, <a href="Auberon%20Waugh">Auberon Alexander</a>, on 17 November 1939. Between these events, "Scoop" was published in May 1938 to wide critical acclaim. In August 1938 Waugh, with Laura, made a three-month trip to <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> after which he wrote "<a href="Robbery%20Under%20Law">Robbery Under Law</a>", based on his experiences there. In the book he spelled out clearly his conservative credo; he later described the book as dealing "little with travel and much with political questions".

Waugh left Piers Court on 1 September 1939, at the outbreak of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> and moved his young family to <a href="Pixton%20Park">Pixton Park</a> in <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>, the Herbert family's country seat, while he sought military employment. He also began writing a novel in a new style, using first-person narration but abandoned work on it when he was commissioned into the <a href="Royal%20Marines">Royal Marines</a> in December and entered training at <a href="Chatham%2C%20Kent">Chatham</a> naval base. He never completed the novel: fragments were eventually published as "Work Suspended and Other Stories" (1943).

Waugh's daily training routine left him with "so stiff a spine that he found it painful even to pick up a pen". In April 1940, he was temporarily promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29">captain</a> and given command of a <a href="company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a> of marines, but he proved an unpopular officer, being haughty and curt with his men. Even after the <a href="Battle%20of%20France">German invasion of the Low Countries</a> (10 May–22 June 1940), his battalion was not called into action. Waugh's inability to adapt to regimental life meant that he soon lost his command, and he became the battalion's Intelligence Officer. In that role, he finally saw action in Operation Menace as part of the British force sent to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dakar">Battle of Dakar</a> in West Africa (23–25 September 1940) in August 1940 to support an attempt by the <a href="Free%20French%20Forces">Free French Forces</a> to overthrow the <a href="Vichy%20France">Vichy French</a> colonial government and install General <a href="Charles%20de%20Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a>. Operation Menace failed, hampered by fog and misinformation about the extent of the town's defences, and the British forces withdrew on 26 September. Waugh's comment on the affair was this: ″Bloodshed has been avoided at the cost of honour.″

In November 1940, Waugh was posted to a <a href="commando">commando</a> unit, and, after further training, became a member of "<a href="Layforce">Layforce</a>", under Colonel (later Brigadier) <a href="Robert%20Laycock">Robert Laycock</a>. In February 1941, the unit sailed to the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a>, where it participated in an unsuccessful attempt to recapture <a href="Bardia">Bardia</a>, on the Libyan coast. In May, Layforce was required to assist in the evacuation of <a href="Crete">Crete</a>: Waugh was shocked by the disorder and its loss of discipline and, as he saw it, the cowardice of the departing troops. In July, during the roundabout journey home by troop ship, he wrote "<a href="Put%20Out%20More%20Flags">Put Out More Flags</a>" (1942), a novel of the war's early months in which he returned to the literary style he had used in the 1930s. Back in Britain, more training and waiting followed until, in May 1942, he was transferred to the <a href="Royal%20Horse%20Guards">Royal Horse Guards</a>, on Laycock's recommendation. On 10 June 1942, Laura gave birth to Margaret, the couple's fourth child.

Waugh's elation at his transfer soon descended into disillusion as he failed to find opportunities for active service. The death of his father, on 26 June 1943, and the need to deal with family affairs prevented him from departing with his brigade for North Africa as part of <a href="Operation%20Husky">Operation Husky</a> (9 July–17 August 1943), the Allied invasion of <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>. Despite his undoubted courage, his unmilitary and insubordinate character were rendering him effectively unemployable as a soldier. After spells of idleness at the regimental depot in <a href="Windsor%2C%20Berkshire">Windsor</a>, Waugh began parachute training at <a href="Tatton%20Park">Tatton Park</a>, Cheshire, but landed awkwardly during an exercise and fractured a <a href="fibula">fibula</a>. Recovering at Windsor, he applied for three months' unpaid leave to write the novel that had been forming in his mind. His request was granted and, on 31 January 1944, he departed for <a href="Chagford">Chagford</a>, Devon, where he could work in seclusion. The result was "<a href="Brideshead%20Revisited">Brideshead Revisited: The Sacred & Profane Memories of Captain Charles Ryder</a>" (1945), the first of his explicitly Catholic novels of which the biographer <a href="Douglas%20Lane%20Patey">Douglas Lane Patey</a> commented that it was "the book that seemed to confirm his new sense of his writerly vocation".

Waugh managed to extend his leave until June 1944. Soon after his return to duty he was recruited by <a href="Randolph%20Churchill">Randolph Churchill</a> to serve in a military mission to <a href="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>, and, early in July, flew with Churchill from <a href="Bari">Bari</a>, Italy, to the Croatian island of <a href="Vis%20%28island%29">Vis</a>. There, they met <a href="Josip%20Broz%20Tito">Marshal Tito</a>, the Communist leader of the <a href="Partisans%20%28Yugoslavia%29">Partisans</a>, who was leading the guerrilla fight against the occupying <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> forces with Allied support. Waugh and Churchill returned to Bari before flying back to Yugoslavia to begin their mission, but their aeroplane crash-landed, both men were injured, and their mission was delayed for a month.

The mission eventually arrived at <a href="Topusko">Topusko</a>, where it established itself in a deserted farmhouse. The group's liaison duties, between the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> and the Communist Partisans, were light. Waugh had little sympathy with the Communist-led Partisans and despised Tito. His chief interest became the welfare of the Catholic Church in Croatia, which, he believed, had suffered at the hands of the <a href="Serbian%20Orthodox%20Church">Serbian Orthodox Church</a> and would fare worse when the Communists took control. He expressed those thoughts in a long report, "Church and State in Liberated Croatia". After spells in <a href="Dubrovnik">Dubrovnik</a> and Rome, Waugh returned to London on 15 March 1945 to present his report, which the <a href="Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Office">Foreign Office</a> suppressed to maintain good relations with Tito, now the leader of communist Yugoslavia.

"Brideshead Revisited" was published in London in May 1945. Waugh had been convinced of the book's qualities, "my first novel rather than my last". It was a tremendous success, bringing its author fame, fortune and literary status. Happy though he was with this outcome, Waugh's principal concern as the war ended was the fate of the large populations of Eastern European Catholics, betrayed (as he saw it) into the hands of <a href="Stalin">Stalin</a>'s <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> by the Allies. He now saw little difference in morality between the war's combatants and later described it as "a sweaty tug-of-war between teams of indistinguishable louts". Although he took momentary pleasure from the defeat of <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> and his <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservatives</a> in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201945">1945 general election</a>, he saw the accession to power of the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> as a triumph of barbarism and the onset of a new "Dark Age".
In September 1945, after he was released by the army, he returned to Piers Court with his family (another daughter, Harriet, had been born at Pixton in 1944) but spent much of the next seven years either in London, or travelling. In March 1946, he visited the <a href="Nuremberg%20trials">Nuremberg trials</a>, and later that year, he was in Spain for a celebration of the 400th anniversary of the death of <a href="Francisco%20de%20Vitoria">Francisco de Vitoria</a>, said to be the founder of <a href="international%20law">international law</a>. Waugh wrote up his experiences of the frustrations of postwar European travel in a novella, "<a href="Scott-King%27s%20Modern%20Europe">Scott-King's Modern Europe</a>". In February 1947, he made the first of several trips to the United States, in the first instance to discuss filming of "Brideshead". The project collapsed, but Waugh used his time in Hollywood to visit the <a href="Forest%20Lawn%20Memorial%20Park%20%28Hollywood%20Hills%29">Forest Lawn cemetery</a>, which provided the basis for his satire of American perspectives on death, "<a href="The%20Loved%20One">The Loved One</a>". In 1951 he visited the <a href="Holy%20Land">Holy Land</a> with his future biographer, Christopher Sykes, and in 1953, he travelled to <a href="Goa">Goa</a> to witness the final exhibition before burial of the remains of the 16th century Jesuit missionary-priest <a href="Francis%20Xavier">Francis Xavier</a>.

In between his journeys, Waugh worked intermittently on "<a href="Helena%20%281950%20novel%29">Helena</a>", a long-planned novel about the discoverer of the <a href="True%20Cross">True Cross</a> that was "far the best book I have ever written or ever will write". Its success with the public was limited, but it was, his daughter Harriet later said, "the only one of his books that he ever cared to read aloud".

In 1952 Waugh published "<a href="Men%20at%20Arms%20%28Evelyn%20Waugh%29">Men at Arms</a>", the first of his semi-autobiographical war trilogy in which he depicted many of his personal experiences and encounters from the early stages of the war. Other books published during this period included "<a href="When%20The%20Going%20Was%20Good">When The Going Was Good</a>" (1946), an anthology of his pre-war travel writing, "The Holy Places" (published by the <a href="Ian%20Fleming">Ian Fleming</a>-managed <a href="Queen%20Anne%20Press">Queen Anne Press</a>, 1952) and "<a href="Love%20Among%20the%20Ruins.%20A%20Romance%20of%20the%20Near%20Future">Love Among the Ruins</a>" (1953), a <a href="dystopia">dystopia</a>n tale in which Waugh displays his contempt for the modern world. Nearing 50, Waugh was old for his years, "selectively deaf, rheumatic, irascible" and increasingly dependent on alcohol and on drugs to relieve his insomnia and depression. Two more children, James (born 1946) and Septimus (born 1950), completed his family.

From 1945 onwards, Waugh became an avid collector of objects, particularly Victorian paintings and furniture. He filled Piers Court with his acquisitions, often from London's <a href="Portobello%20Market">Portobello Market</a> and from house clearance sales. His diary entry for 30 August 1946 records a visit to <a href="Gloucester">Gloucester</a>, where he bought "a lion of wood, finely carved for £25, also a bookcase £35... a charming Chinese painting £10, a Regency easel £7". Some of his buying was shrewd and prescient; he paid £10 for Rossetti's "Spirit of the Rainbow" to begin a collection of Victorian paintings that eventually acquired great value. Waugh also began, from 1949, to write knowledgeable reviews and articles on the subject of painting.

By 1953, Waugh's popularity as a writer was declining. He was perceived as out of step with the "<a href="Zeitgeist">Zeitgeist</a>", and the large fees he demanded were no longer easily available. His money was running out and progress on the second book of his war trilogy, "<a href="Officers%20and%20Gentlemen">Officers and Gentlemen</a>", had stalled. Partly because of his dependency on drugs, his health was steadily deteriorating. Shortage of cash led him to agree in November 1953 to be interviewed on BBC radio, where the panel took an aggressive line: "they tried to make a fool of me, and I don't think they entirely succeeded", Waugh wrote to Nancy Mitford. <a href="Peter%20Fleming%20%28writer%29">Peter Fleming</a> in "<a href="The%20Spectator">The Spectator</a>" likened the interview to "the goading of a bull by matadors".

Early in 1954, Waugh's doctors, concerned by his physical deterioration, advised a change of scene. On 29 January, he took a ship bound for <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Ceylon</a>, hoping that he would be able to finish his novel. Within a few days, he was writing home complaining of "other passengers whispering about me" and of hearing voices, including that of his recent BBC <a href="interlocutor%20%28linguistics%29">interlocutor</a>, Stephen Black. He left the ship in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> and flew on to <a href="Colombo">Colombo</a>, but, he wrote to Laura, the voices followed him. Alarmed, Laura sought help from her friend, <a href="Frances%20Donaldson">Frances Donaldson</a>, whose husband agreed to fly out to Ceylon and bring Waugh home. In fact, Waugh made his own way back, now believing that he was being possessed by devils. A brief medical examination indicated that Waugh was suffering from <a href="bromism">bromide poisoning</a> from his drugs regimen. When his medication was changed, the voices and the other hallucinations quickly disappeared. Waugh was delighted, informing all of his friends that he had been mad: "Clean off my onion!". The experience was fictionalised a few years later, in "<a href="The%20Ordeal%20of%20Gilbert%20Pinfold">The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold</a>" (1957).

In 1956, <a href="Edwin%20Newman">Edwin Newman</a> made a short film about Waugh. In the course of doing so, Newman learned that Waugh hated the modern world and wished that he had been born two or three centuries sooner. Waugh disliked modern methods of transportation or communication, refusing to drive or use the telephone, and writing with a quill pen. Waugh also expressed the view that American news reporters could not function without frequent infusions of <a href="whisky">whisky</a> and that every American had been divorced at least once.

Restored to health, Waugh returned to work and finished "Officers and Gentlemen". In June 1955 the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>" journalist and reviewer <a href="Nancy%20Spain">Nancy Spain</a>, accompanied by her friend Lord Noel-Buxton, arrived uninvited at Piers Court and demanded an interview. Waugh saw the pair off and wrote a wry account for "The Spectator", but he was troubled by the incident and decided to sell Piers Court: "I felt it was polluted", he told Nancy Mitford. Late in 1956, the family moved to the manor house in the Somerset village of <a href="Combe%20Florey">Combe Florey</a>. In January 1957, Waugh avenged the Spain–Noel-Buxton intrusion by winning libel damages from the "Express" and Spain. The paper had printed an article by Spain that suggested that the sales of Waugh's books were much lower than they were and that his worth, as a journalist, was low.

"<a href="The%20Ordeal%20of%20Gilbert%20Pinfold">Gilbert Pinfold</a>" was published in the summer of 1957, "my barmy book", Waugh called it. The extent to which the story is self-mockery, rather than true autobiography, became a subject of critical debate. Waugh's next major book was a biography of his longtime friend <a href="Ronald%20Knox">Ronald Knox</a>, the Catholic writer and theologian who had died in August 1957. Research and writing extended over two years during which Waugh did little other work, delaying the third volume of his war trilogy. In June 1958, his son Auberon was severely wounded in a shooting accident while serving with the army in <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>. Waugh remained detached; he neither went to Cyprus nor immediately visited Auberon on the latter's return to Britain. The critic and <a href="biography%20in%20literature">literary biographer</a> David Wykes called Waugh's sang-froid "astonishing" and the family's apparent acceptance of his behaviour even more so.

Although most of Waugh's books had sold well, and he had been well-rewarded for his journalism, his levels of expenditure meant that money problems and tax bills were a recurrent feature in his life. In 1950, as a means of <a href="tax%20avoidance">tax avoidance</a>, he had set up a trust fund for his children (he termed it the "Save the Children Fund", after the <a href="Save%20the%20Children">well-established charity of that name</a>) into which he placed the initial advance and all future royalties from the Penguin (paperback) editions of his books. He was able to augment his personal finances by charging household items to the trust or selling his own possessions to it. Nonetheless, by 1960, shortage of money led him to agree to an interview on BBC Television, in the "<a href="Face%20to%20Face%20%28British%20TV%20series%29">Face to Face</a>" series conducted by <a href="John%20Freeman%20%28British%20politician%29">John Freeman</a>. The interview was broadcast on 26 June 1960; according to his biographer <a href="Selina%20Hastings%20%28writer%29">Selena Hastings</a>, Waugh restrained his instinctive hostility and coolly answered the questions put to him by Freeman, assuming what she describes as a "pose of world-weary boredom".

In 1960, Waugh was offered the honour of a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">CBE</a> but declined, believing that he should have been given the superior status of a <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighthood</a>. In September, he produced his final travel book, "<a href="A%20Tourist%20in%20Africa">A Tourist in Africa</a>", based on a visit made in January–March 1959. He enjoyed the trip but "despised" the book. The critic <a href="Cyril%20Connolly">Cyril Connolly</a> called it "the thinnest piece of book-making that Mr Waugh has undertaken". The book done, he worked on the last of the war trilogy, which was published in 1961 as "Unconditional Surrender".

As he approached his sixties, Waugh was in poor health, prematurely aged, "fat, deaf, short of breath", according to Patey. His biographer Martin Stannard likened his appearance around this time to that of "an exhausted rogue jollied up by drink". In 1962 Waugh began work on his autobiography, and that same year wrote his final fiction, the long short story "Basil Seal Rides Again". This revival of the protagonist of "Black Mischief" and "Put Out More Flags" was published in 1963; the "<a href="Times%20Literary%20Supplement">Times Literary Supplement</a>" called it a "nasty little book". When the first volume of autobiography, "A Little Learning", was published in 1964, Waugh's often oblique tone and discreet name changes ensured that friends avoided the embarrassments that some had feared.

Waugh had welcomed the accession in 1958 of <a href="Pope%20John%20XXIII">Pope John XXIII</a> and wrote an appreciative tribute on the pope's death in 1963. However, he became increasingly concerned by the decisions emerging from the <a href="Second%20Vatican%20Council">Second Vatican Council</a>, which was convened by Pope John in October 1962 and continued under his successor, <a href="Pope%20Paul%20VI">Pope Paul VI</a> until 1965. Waugh, a staunch opponent of Church reform, was particularly distressed by the replacement of the universal <a href="Latin%20Mass">Latin Mass</a> with the <a href="vernacular">vernacular</a>. In a "Spectator" article of 23 November 1962, he argued the case against change in a manner described by a later commentator as "sharp-edged reasonableness". He wrote to Nancy Mitford that "the buggering up of the Church is a deep sorrow to me... We write letters to the paper. A fat lot of good that does."

In 1965, a new financial crisis arose from an apparent flaw in the terms of the "Save the Children" trust, and a large sum of back tax was being demanded. Waugh's agent, A.D. Peters, negotiated a settlement with the tax authorities for a manageable amount, but in his concern to generate funds, Waugh signed contracts to write several books, including a history of the papacy, an illustrated book on the Crusades and a second volume of autobiography. Waugh's physical and mental deterioration prevented any work on these projects, and the contracts were cancelled. He described himself as "toothless, deaf, melancholic, shaky on my pins, unable to eat, full of dope, quite idle" and expressed the belief that "all fates were worse than death". His only significant literary activity in 1965 was the editing of the three war novels into a single volume, published as "Sword of Honour".

On Easter Day, 10 April 1966, after attending a Latin Mass in a neighbouring village with members of his family, Waugh died of heart failure at his Combe Florey home, at 62. He was buried, by special arrangement, in a consecrated plot outside the Anglican churchyard of the <a href="Church%20of%20St%20Peter%20%26amp%3B%20St%20Paul%2C%20Combe%20Florey">Church of St Peter & St Paul, Combe Florey</a>. A <a href="Requiem%20Mass">Requiem Mass</a>, in Latin, was celebrated in <a href="Westminster%20Cathedral">Westminster Cathedral</a> on 21 April 1966.

In the course of his lifetime, Waugh made enemies and offended many people; writer <a href="James%20Lees-Milne">James Lees-Milne</a> said that Waugh "was the nastiest-tempered man in England". Waugh's son, <a href="Auberon%20Waugh">Auberon</a>, said that the force of his father's personality was such that, despite his lack of height, "generals and chancellors of the exchequer, six-foot-six and exuding self-importance from every pore, quail[ed] in front of him".

In the biographic "Mad World" (2009), Paula Byrne said that the common view of Evelyn Waugh as a "snobbish misanthrope" is a caricature; he asks: "Why would a man, who was so unpleasant, be so beloved by such a wide circle of friends?" His generosity to individual persons and causes, especially Catholic causes, extended to small gestures; after his libel-court victory over <a href="Nancy%20Spain">Nancy Spain</a>, he sent her a bottle of champagne. Hastings said that Waugh's outward personal belligerence to strangers was not entirely serious but an attempt at "finding a sparring partner worthy of his own wit and ingenuity". Besides mocking others, Waugh mocked himself—the elderly buffer, "crusty colonel" image, which he presented in later life, was a comic impersonation, and not his true self.

As an instinctive conservative, Waugh believed that class divisions, with inequalities of wealth and position, were natural and that "no form of government [was] ordained by God as being better than any other". In the post-war "Age of the Common Man", he attacked socialism (the "Cripps–Attlee terror") and complained, after Churchill's election in 1951, that "the Conservative Party have never put the clock back a single second". Waugh never voted in elections; in 1959, he expressed a hope that the Conservatives would win the election, which they did, but would not vote for them, saying "I should feel I was morally inculpated in their follies" and added: "I do not aspire to advise my sovereign in her choice of servants".

Waugh's Catholicism was fundamental: "The Church ... is the normal state of man from which men have disastrously exiled themselves." He believed that the Catholic Church was the last, great defence against the encroachment of the Dark Age being ushered in by the <a href="welfare%20state">welfare state</a> and the spreading of <a href="working%20class%20culture">working class culture</a>. Strictly observant, Waugh admitted to Diana Cooper that his most difficult task was how to square the obligations of his faith with his indifference to his fellow men. When Nancy Mitford asked him how he reconciled his often objectionable conduct with being a Christian, Waugh replied that "were he not a Christian he would be even more horrible".

Waugh's conservatism was <a href="aesthetics">aesthetic</a> as well as political and religious. Although he praised younger writers, such as <a href="Angus%20Wilson">Angus Wilson</a>, <a href="Muriel%20Spark">Muriel Spark</a> and <a href="V.S.%20Naipaul">V.S. Naipaul</a>, he was scornful of the 1950s writers' group known as "<a href="The%20Movement%20%28literature%29">The Movement</a>". He said that the literary world was "sinking into black disaster" and that literature might die within thirty years. As a schoolboy, Waugh had praised the art of <a href="Cubism">Cubism</a> but soon abandoned his interest in artistic <a href="Modernism">Modernism</a>. In 1945, Waugh said that <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a>'s artistic standing was the result of a "mesmeric trick" and that his paintings "could not be intelligently discussed in the terms used of the civilised <a href="Old%20Masters">masters</a>". In 1953, in a radio interview, he named <a href="Augustus%20Egg">Augustus Egg</a> (1816–1863) as a painter for whom he had particular esteem. Despite their political differences, Waugh came to admire <a href="George%20Orwell">George Orwell</a>, because of their shared patriotism and sense of <a href="morality">morality</a>.

Throughout his literary works, Evelyn Waugh freely expressed <a href="racialism">racial</a> and <a href="anti-Semitism">anti-semitic</a> prejudices, especially in the books he wrote before the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. The writer <a href="V.S.%20Pritchett">V.S. Pritchett</a> said that Waugh's anti-semitism, "like <a href="Mount%20Everest">Mount Everest</a>, is there, nonviolent, but undeniable". Wykes said that anti-semitism is Waugh's "most persistent nastiness", adding that Waugh's racism was "an illogical extension of his views on the naturalness and rightness of <a href="hierarchy">hierarchy</a> as the [main] principle of social organisation". As an admirer of Waugh's writing, Orwell said that Evelyn Waugh was "almost as good a novelist as it is possible to be... while holding untenable opinions".

Wykes observes that Waugh's novels reprise and fictionalise the principal events of his life, although in an early essay Waugh wrote: "Nothing is more insulting to a novelist than to assume that he is incapable of anything but the mere transcription of what he observes". The reader should not assume that the author agreed with the opinions expressed by his fictional characters. Nevertheless, in the Introduction to the "Complete Short Stories", Ann Pasternak Slater said that the "delineation of social prejudices and the language in which they are expressed is part of Waugh's meticulous observation of his contemporary world".

The critic <a href="Clive%20James">Clive James</a> said of Waugh: "Nobody ever wrote a more unaffectedly elegant English... its hundreds of years of steady development culminate in him". As his talent developed and matured, he maintained what literary critic Andrew Michael Roberts called "an exquisite sense of the ludicrous, and a fine aptitude for exposing false attitudes". In the first stages of his 40-year writing career, before his conversion to Catholicism in 1930, Waugh was the novelist of the <a href="Bright%20Young%20People">Bright Young People</a> generation. His first two novels, "<a href="Decline%20and%20Fall">Decline and Fall</a>" (1928) and "<a href="Vile%20Bodies">Vile Bodies</a>" (1930), comically reflect a futile society, populated by two-dimensional, basically unbelievable characters in circumstances too fantastic to evoke the reader's emotions. A typical Waugh trademark evident in the early novels is rapid, unattributed dialogue in which the participants can be readily identified. At the same time Waugh was writing serious essays, such as "The War and the Younger Generation" in which he castigates his own generation as "crazy and sterile" people.

Waugh's conversion to Catholicism did not noticeably change the nature of his next two novels, "<a href="Black%20Mischief">Black Mischief</a>" (1934) and "<a href="A%20Handful%20of%20Dust">A Handful of Dust</a>" (1934), but, in the latter novel, the elements of <a href="farce">farce</a> are subdued, and the protagonist, Tony Last, is recognisably a person rather than a comic cipher. Waugh's first fiction with a Catholic theme was the short story "Out of Depth" (1933) about the immutability of the Mass. From the mid-1930s onwards, Catholicism and conservative politics were much featured in his journalistic and non-fiction writing before he reverted to his former manner with "Scoop" (1938), a novel about journalism, journalists, and unsavoury journalistic practices.

In "Work Suspended and Other Stories" Waugh introduced "real" characters and a first-person narrator, signalling the literary style he would adopt in "Brideshead Revisited" a few years later. "Brideshead", which questions the meaning of human existence without God, is the first novel in which Evelyn Waugh clearly presents his conservative religious and political views. In the "LIFE" magazine article, "Fan Fare" (1946), Waugh said that "you can only leave God out [of fiction] by making your characters pure abstractions" and that his future novels shall be "the attempt to represent man more fully which, to me, means only one thing, man in his relation to God." As such, the novel "<a href="Helena%20%281950%20novel%29">Helena</a>" (1950) is Evelyn Waugh's most philosophically Christian book.

In "Brideshead", the <a href="proletarian">proletarian</a> junior officer Hooper illustrates a theme that persists in Waugh's postwar fiction: the rise of mediocrity in the "Age of the Common Man". In the trilogy "<a href="Sword%20of%20Honour">Sword of Honour</a>" ("Men at Arms", 1952; "Officers and Gentlemen", 1955, "Unconditional Surrender", 1961) the social pervasiveness of mediocrity is personified in the semi-comical character "Trimmer", a sloven and a fraud who triumphs by contrivance. In the novella "<a href="Scott-King%27s%20Modern%20Europe">Scott-King's Modern Europe</a>" (1947), Waugh's pessimism about the future is in the schoolmaster's admonition: "I think it would be very wicked, indeed, to do anything to fit a boy for the modern world". Likewise, such cynicism pervades the novel "Love Among the Ruins" (1953), set in a dystopian, welfare-state Britain that is so socially disagreeable that <a href="euthanasia">euthanasia</a> is the most sought-after of the government's social services. Of the postwar novels, Patey says that "The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold" (1957) stands out ″a kind of mock-novel, a sly invitation to a game″. Waugh's final work of fiction, "Basil Seal Rides Again" (1962), features characters from the prewar novels; Waugh admitted that the work was a ″senile attempt to recapture the manner of my youth″. Stylistically this final story begins in the same fashion as the first story, ″The Balance" of 1926, with a "fusillade of unattributed dialogue".

Of Waugh's early books, "Decline and Fall" was hailed by <a href="Arnold%20Bennett">Arnold Bennett</a> in the "<a href="Evening%20Standard">Evening Standard</a>" as "an uncompromising and brilliantly malicious satire". The critical reception of "Vile Bodies" two years later was even more enthusiastic, with Rebecca West predicting that Waugh was "destined to be the dazzling figure of his age". However, "A Handful of Dust", later widely regarded as a masterpiece, received a more muted welcome from critics, despite the author's own high estimation of the work. The book's ending, with Tony Last condemned forever to read Dickens to his mad jungle captor, was thought by the critic <a href="Henry%20Green">Henry Yorke</a> to reduce an otherwise believable book to "phantasy". <a href="Cyril%20Connolly">Cyril Connolly</a>'s first reaction to the book was that Waugh's powers were failing, an opinion that he later revised.

In the latter 1930s, Waugh's inclination to Catholic and conservative polemics affected his standing with the general reading public. The Campion biography is said by David Wykes to be "so rigidly biased that it has no claims to make as history". The pro-fascist tone in parts of "Waugh in Abyssinia" offended readers and critics and prevented its publication in America. There was general relief among critics when "Scoop", in 1938, indicated a return to Waugh's earlier comic style. Critics had begun to think that his wit had been displaced by partisanship and propaganda.

Waugh maintained his reputation in 1942, with "Put Out More Flags", which sold well despite wartime restrictions on paper and printing. Its public reception, however, did not compare with that accorded to "Brideshead Revisited" three years later, on both sides of the Atlantic. "Brideshead"'s selection as the American <a href="Book%20of%20the%20Month%20Club">Book of the Month</a> swelled its US sales to an extent that dwarfed those in Britain, which was affected by paper shortages. Despite the public's enthusiasm, critical opinion was split. "Brideshead's" Catholic standpoint offended some critics who had greeted Waugh's earlier novels with warm praise. Its perceived snobbery and its deference to the aristocracy were attacked by, among others, <a href="Conor%20Cruise%20O%27Brien">Conor Cruise O'Brien</a> who, in the Irish literary magazine "<a href="The%20Bell%20%28magazine%29">The Bell</a>", wrote of Waugh's "almost mystical veneration" for the upper classes. Fellow writer <a href="Rose%20Macaulay">Rose Macaulay</a> believed that Waugh's genius had been adversely affected by the intrusion of his right-wing partisan "alter ego" and that he had lost his detachment: "In art so naturally ironic and detached as his, this is a serious loss". Conversely, the book was praised by Yorke, <a href="Graham%20Greene">Graham Greene</a> and, in glowing terms, by <a href="Harold%20Acton">Harold Acton</a> who was particularly impressed by its evocation of 1920s Oxford. In 1959, at the request of publishers Chapman and Hall and in some deference to his critics, Waugh revised the book and wrote in a preface: "I have modified the grosser passages but not obliterated them because they are an essential part of the book".

In "Fan Fare", Waugh forecasts that his future books will be unpopular because of their religious theme. On publication in 1950, "Helena" was received indifferently by the public and by critics, who disparaged the awkward mixing of 20th century schoolgirl slang with otherwise reverential prose. Otherwise, Waugh's prediction proved unfounded; all his fiction remained in print and sales stayed healthy. During his successful 1957 lawsuit against the "Daily Express", Waugh's counsel produced figures showing total sales to that time of over four million books, two thirds in Britain and the rest in America. "Men at Arms", the first volume of his war trilogy, won the <a href="James%20Tait%20Black%20Memorial%20Prize">James Tait Black Memorial Prize</a> in 1953; initial critical comment was lukewarm, with Connolly likening "Men at Arms" to beer rather than champagne. Connolly changed his view later, calling the completed trilogy "the finest novel to come out of the war". Of Waugh's other major postwar works, the Knox biography was admired within Waugh's close circle but criticised by others in the Church for its depiction of Knox as an unappreciated victim of the Catholic hierarchy. The book did not sell well—"like warm cakes", according to Waugh. "Pinfold" surprised the critics by its originality. Its plainly autobiographical content, Hastings suggests, gave the public a fixed image of Waugh: "stout, splenetic, red-faced and reactionary, a figure from burlesque complete with cigar, bowler hat and loud checked suit."

In 1973, Waugh's diaries were serialised in "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" prior to publication in book form in 1976. The revelations about his private life, thoughts and attitudes created controversy. Although Waugh had removed embarrassing entries relating to his Oxford years and his first marriage, there was sufficient left on the record to enable enemies to project a negative image of the writer as intolerant, snobbish and sadistic, with pronounced fascist leanings. Some of this picture, it was maintained by Waugh's supporters, arose from poor editing of the diaries, and a desire to transform Waugh from a writer to a "character". Nevertheless, a popular conception developed of Waugh as a monster. When, in 1980, a selection of his letters was published, his reputation became the subject of further discussion. <a href="Philip%20Larkin">Philip Larkin</a>, reviewing the collection in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", thought that it demonstrated Waugh's elitism; to receive a letter from him, it seemed, "one would have to have a nursery nickname and be a member of <a href="White%27s">White's</a>, a Roman Catholic, a high-born lady or an Old Etonian novelist".
The publication of the diaries and letters promoted increased interest in Waugh and his works and caused publication of much new material. Christopher Sykes's biography had appeared in 1975, between 1980 and 1998 three more full biographies were issued and other biographical and critical studies have continued to be produced. A collection of Waugh's journalism and reviews was published in 1983, revealing a fuller range of his ideas and beliefs. The new material provided further grounds for debate between Waugh's supporters and detractors. The 1982 <a href="Granada%20Television">Granada Television</a> <a href="Brideshead%20Revisited%20%28TV%20serial%29">adaptation of "Brideshead Revisited"</a> introduced a new generation to Waugh's works, in Britain and in America. There had been earlier television treatment of Waugh's fiction, as "Sword of Honour" had been serialised by the <a href="British%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">BBC</a> in 1967, but the impact of Granada's "Brideshead" was much wider. Its nostalgic depiction of a vanished form of Englishness appealed to the American mass market; "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine's TV critic described the series as "a novel... made into a poem", and listed it among the "100 Best TV Shows of All Time". There have been further cinematic Waugh adaptations: "A Handful of Dust" in 1988, "Vile Bodies" (filmed as "Bright Young Things") in 2003 and "Brideshead" again in 2008. These popular treatments have maintained the public's appetite for Waugh's novels, all of which remain in print and continue to sell. Several have been listed among various compiled lists of the world's greatest novels.

Stannard concludes that beneath his public mask, Waugh was "a dedicated artist and a man of earnest faith, struggling against the dryness of his soul". <a href="Graham%20Greene">Graham Greene</a>, in a letter to "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" shortly after Waugh's death, acknowledged him as "the greatest novelist of my generation", while "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine's obituarist called him "the grand old mandarin of modern British prose" and asserted that his novels "will continue to survive as long as there are readers who can savor what critic <a href="V.%20S.%20Pritchett">V. S. Pritchett</a> calls 'the beauty of his malice' ". Nancy Mitford said of him in a television interview, "What nobody remembers about Evelyn is that everything with him was jokes. Everything. That's what none of the people who wrote about him seem to have taken into account at all".

Alan Shepard

<a href="Rear%20admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Rear Admiral</a> Alan Bartlett Shepard Jr. (November 18, 1923 – July 21, 1998) was an American <a href="astronaut">astronaut</a>, <a href="United%20States%20naval%20aviator">naval aviator</a>, <a href="test%20pilot">test pilot</a>, and <a href="businessman">businessman</a>. In 1961 he became the first American to travel into space, and in 1971 he walked on the <a href="Moon">Moon</a>.

A graduate of the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a> at <a href="Annapolis">Annapolis</a>, Shepard saw action with the surface navy during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. He became a naval aviator in 1946, and a test pilot in 1950. He was selected as one of the original <a href="NASA">NASA</a> <a href="Mercury%20Seven">Mercury Seven</a> astronauts in 1959, and in May 1961 he made the first manned <a href="Project%20Mercury">Project Mercury</a> flight, <a href="Mercury-Redstone%203">MR-3</a>, in a spacecraft he named "Freedom 7". His craft entered space, but was not capable of achieving <a href="orbit">orbit</a>. He became the second person, and the first American, to travel into space, and the first space traveler to manually control the orientation of his craft. In the final stages of Project Mercury, Shepard was scheduled to pilot the <a href="Mercury-Atlas%2010">Mercury-Atlas 10</a> (MA-10), which was planned as a three-day mission. He named Mercury Spacecraft 15B "Freedom 7 II" in honor of his first spacecraft, but the mission was canceled.

Shepard was designated as the commander of the first manned <a href="Project%20Gemini">Project Gemini</a> mission, but was grounded in 1963 due to <a href="M%C3%A9ni%C3%A8re%27s%20disease">Ménière's disease</a>, an inner-ear ailment that caused episodes of extreme dizziness and nausea. This was surgically corrected in 1969, and in 1971, Shepard commanded the <a href="Apollo%2014">Apollo 14</a> mission, piloting the <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Module">Apollo Lunar Module</a> "Antares" to the most accurate landing of the <a href="Apollo%20program">Apollo</a> missions. At age 47, he became <a href="List%20of%20Apollo%20astronauts">the fifth, the oldest, and the earliest-born person to walk on the Moon</a>, and the only one of the Mercury Seven astronauts to do so. During the mission, he hit two <a href="golf%20ball">golf ball</a>s on the <a href="lunar%20surface">lunar surface</a>. He was <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Astronaut%20Office">Chief of the Astronaut Office</a> from November 1963 to July 1969 (the approximate period of his grounding), and from June 1971 until his retirement from the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> and NASA on August 1, 1974. He was promoted to rear admiral on August 25, 1971, the first astronaut to reach that rank.

Alan Bartlett Shepard Jr. was born on November 18, 1923, in <a href="Derry%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Derry, New Hampshire</a>, to Alan B. Shepard Sr. and Pauline Renza Shepard (). He had a younger sister, Pauline, who was known as Polly. He was one of many famous descendants of "<a href="Mayflower">Mayflower</a>" passenger <a href="Richard%20Warren">Richard Warren</a>. His father, Alan B. Shepard Sr., known as Bart, worked in the Derry National Bank, owned by Shepard's grandfather. Alan Sr. joined the <a href="National%20Guard%20of%20the%20United%20States">National Guard</a> in 1915 and served in France with the <a href="American%20Expeditionary%20Force">American Expeditionary Force</a> during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. He remained in the National Guard between the wars, and was recalled to active duty during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, rising to the rank of <a href="lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant colonel</a>.

Shepard attended Adams School in Derry, where his academic performance impressed his teachers; he skipped the sixth grade, and proceeded to <a href="middle%20school">middle school</a> at Oak Street School in Derry, where he skipped the eighth grade. In 1936, he went to the <a href="Pinkerton%20Academy">Pinkerton Academy</a>, a private school in Derry that his father had attended and where his grandfather had been a trustee. He completed years 9 to 12 there. Fascinated by flight, he created a model airplane club at the Academy, and his Christmas present in 1938 was a flight in a <a href="Douglas%20DC-3">Douglas DC-3</a>. The following year he began cycling to <a href="Manchester%E2%80%93Boston%20Regional%20Airport">Manchester Airfield</a>, where he would do odd jobs in exchange for the occasional ride in an airplane or informal flying lesson.

Shepard graduated from Pinkerton Academy in 1940. Because World War II was already raging in Europe, his father wanted him to join the Army. Shepard chose the Navy instead. He easily passed the entrance exam to the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a> at <a href="Annapolis">Annapolis</a> in 1940, but at sixteen was too young to enter that year. The Navy sent him to the <a href="Admiral%20Farragut%20Academy">Admiral Farragut Academy</a>, a <a href="University-preparatory%20school">prep school</a> for the Naval Academy, from which he graduated with the class of 1941. Tests administered at Farragut indicated an <a href="IQ">IQ</a> of 145, but his grades were mediocre.

At Annapolis, Shepard enjoyed <a href="aquatic%20sports">aquatic sports</a>. He was a keen and competitive sailor, winning several races, including a <a href="regatta">regatta</a> held by the Annapolis Yacht Club. He learned to sail all the types of boats the academy owned, up to and including , a <a href="schooner">schooner</a>. He also participated in <a href="swimming%20%28sport%29">swimming</a>, and rowed with the <a href="eight%20%28rowing%29">eight</a>. During his Christmas break in 1942, he went to <a href="Principia%20College">Principia College</a> to be with his sister, who was unable to go home owing to wartime travel restrictions. There he met Louise Brewer, whose parents were pensioners on the <a href="du%20Pont%20family">du Pont family</a> estate, and, like Renza Shepard, were devout <a href="Christian%20Scientist">Christian Scientist</a>s. Owing to the war, the usual four-year course at Annapolis was cut short by a year, and he graduated and was commissioned as an <a href="Ensign%20%28rank%29%23United%20States">ensign</a> on June 6, 1944, ranked 463rd in his class of 915. The following month he became secretly engaged to Louise. In 1944 he received a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Science">Bachelor of Science</a> at the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a>.

After a month of classroom instruction in aviation, Shepard was posted to a <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>, , in August 1944; it was US Navy policy that aviation candidates should first have some service at sea. At the time the destroyer was deployed on active service in the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>. Shepard joined it when it returned to the naval base at <a href="Ulithi">Ulithi</a> on October 30. After just two days at sea "Cogswell" helped rescue 172 sailors from the <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a> , which had been torpedoed by a Japanese submarine, then escorted the crippled ship back to Ulithi. The ship was buffeted by <a href="Typhoon%20Cobra">Typhoon Cobra</a> in December 1944, a storm in which three other destroyers went down, and battled <a href="kamikazes">kamikazes</a> in the <a href="invasion%20of%20Lingayen%20Gulf">invasion of Lingayen Gulf</a> in January 1945.
"Cogswell" returned to the United States for an overhaul in February 1945. Shepard was given three weeks' leave, in which time he and Louise decided to marry. The ceremony took place on March 3, 1945, in St. Stephen's Lutheran Church in <a href="Wilmington%2C%20Delaware">Wilmington, Delaware</a>. His father, Bart, served as his best man. The newlyweds had only a brief time together before Shepard rejoined "Cogswell" at the <a href="Long%20Beach%20Navy%20Yard">Long Beach Navy Yard</a> on April 5, 1945. After the war, they had two children, both daughters: Laura, born in 1947, and Julie, born in 1951. Following the death of Louise's sister in 1956, they raised her five-year-old niece, Judith Williams—whom they renamed Alice to avoid confusion with Julie—as their own, although they never adopted her. They eventually had six grandchildren.

On Shepard's second cruise with "Cogswell", he was appointed a gunnery officer, responsible for the 20 mm and 40 mm antiaircraft guns on the ship's bow. They engaged kamikazes in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Okinawa">Battle of Okinawa</a>, where the ship served in the dangerous role of a <a href="radar%20picket">radar picket</a>. The job of the radar pickets was to warn the fleet of incoming kamikazes, but because they were often the first ships sighted by incoming Japanese aircraft, they were also the most likely ships to be attacked. "Cogswell" performed this duty from May 27, 1945, until June 26, when it rejoined <a href="Task%20Force%2038">Task Force 38</a>. The ship also participated in the <a href="Allied%20naval%20bombardments%20of%20Japan%20during%20World%20War%20II">Allied naval bombardments of Japan</a>, and was present in <a href="Tokyo%20Bay">Tokyo Bay</a> for the <a href="Surrender%20of%20Japan">Surrender of Japan</a> in September 1945. Shepard returned to the United States later that month.
In November 1945, Shepard arrived at <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Corpus%20Christi">Naval Air Station Corpus Christi</a> in <a href="Texas">Texas</a>, where he commenced basic flight training on January 7, 1946. He was an average student, and for a time faced being "bilged" (dropped) from flight training and reassigned to the surface navy. To make up for this, he took private lessons at a local civilian flying school—something the Navy frowned on—earning a civil pilot's license. His flying skills gradually improved, and by early 1947 his instructors rated him above average. He was sent to <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Pensacola">Naval Air Station Pensacola</a> in <a href="Florida">Florida</a> for advanced training. His final test was six perfect landings on the carrier . The following day, he received his <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Aviator">naval aviator</a> <a href="United%20States%20Aviator%20Badge">wings</a>, which his father pinned on his chest.

Shepard was assigned to <a href="Attack%20Squadron%2042%20%28United%20States%20Navy%29">Fighter Squadron 42</a> (VF-42), flying the <a href="Vought%20F4U%20Corsair">Vought F4U Corsair</a>. The squadron was nominally based on the <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> , but the ship was being overhauled at the time Shepard arrived, and in the meantime the squadron was based at <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Norfolk">Naval Air Station Norfolk</a> in <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>. He departed on his first cruise, of the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, on "Franklin D. Roosevelt" with VF-42 in 1948. Most of the aviators were, like Shepard, on their first assignment. Those who were not were given the opportunity to qualify for night landings on a carrier, a dangerous maneuver, especially in a Corsair, which had to bank sharply on approach. Shepard managed to persuade his squadron commander to allow him to qualify as well. After briefly returning to Norfolk, the carrier set out on a nine-month tour of the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>. He earned a reputation for carousing and chasing women. He also instituted a ritual of, whenever he could, calling Louise at 17:00 (her time) each day.

Normally sea duty alternated with periods of duty ashore. In 1950, Shepard was selected to attend the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Test%20Pilot%20School">United States Naval Test Pilot School</a> at <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Patuxent%20River">Naval Air Station Patuxent River</a> in <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>. As a test pilot he conducted high-altitude tests to obtain information about the light and air masses at different altitudes over North America; carrier suitability certification of the <a href="McDonnell%20F2H%20Banshee">McDonnell F2H Banshee</a>; experiments with the Navy's new in-flight refueling system; and tests of the <a href="angled%20flight%20deck">angled flight deck</a>. He narrowly avoided being <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a>ed by the station commander, <a href="Rear%20Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Alfred%20M.%20Pride">Alfred M. Pride</a>, after looping the <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay%20Bridge">Chesapeake Bay Bridge</a> and making low passes over the beach at <a href="Ocean%20City%2C%20Maryland">Ocean City, Maryland</a>, and the base; but Shepard's superiors, <a href="John%20Hyland">John Hyland</a> and Robert M. Elder, interceded on his behalf.
Shepard's next assignment was to <a href="VF-142">VF-193</a>, a <a href="night%20fighter">night fighter</a> squadron flying the Banshee, that was based at <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Moffett%20Field">Naval Air Station Moffett Field</a>, <a href="California">California</a>. The squadron was part of Commander <a href="James%20D.%20Ramage">James D. "Jig Dog" Ramage</a>'s Air Group 19. Naval aviators with experience in jet aircraft were still relatively rare, and Ramage specifically requested Shepard's assignment on the advice of Elder, who commanded VF-193's sister squadron, <a href="VF-191">VF-191</a>. Ramage made Shepard his own <a href="wingman">wingman</a>, a decision that would save Ramage's life in 1954, when his oxygen system failed and Shepard talked him through a landing. As squadron operations officer, Shepard's most important task was imparting his knowledge of flying jets to his fellow aviators to keep them alive. He served two tours on the aircraft carrier in the western Pacific. It set out on a combat tour off Korea in 1953, during the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>, but the <a href="Korean%20Armistice%20Agreement">Korean Armistice Agreement</a> ended the fighting in July 1953, and Shepard did not see combat.

Rear Admiral <a href="John%20P.%20Whitney">John P. Whitney</a> requested Shepard's services as an <a href="aide%20de%20camp">aide de camp</a>, but Shepard wanted to fly. Therefore, at Shepard's request, Ramage spoke to the admiral on his behalf, and Shepard was instead sent back to Patuxent. He flight tested the <a href="McDonnell%20F3H%20Demon">McDonnell F3H Demon</a>, <a href="Vought%20F-8%20Crusader">Vought F-8 Crusader</a>, <a href="Douglas%20F4D%20Skyray">Douglas F4D Skyray</a> and <a href="Grumman%20F-11%20Tiger">Grumman F-11 Tiger</a>. The <a href="Vought%20F7U%20Cutlass">Vought F7U Cutlass</a> tended to go into an inverted spin during a snap roll. This was not unusual; many aircraft did this, but normally if the pilot let go of the stick the aircraft would correct itself. When he attempted this in the F7U, Shepard found this was not the case. He was unable to break out of the spin and was forced to eject. In 1957, he was project test pilot on the <a href="Douglas%20F5D%20Skylancer">Douglas F5D Skylancer</a>. Shepard did not like the plane, and gave it an unfavorable report. The Navy canceled orders for it, buying the F8U instead. He also filed an unfavorable report on the F11F after a harrowing incident in which the engine failed on him during a high-speed dive. Fortunately, he managed to restart the engine.

Shepard was an <a href="flight%20instructor">instructor</a> at the Test Pilot School, and then entered the <a href="Naval%20War%20College">Naval War College</a> at <a href="Newport%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Newport, Rhode Island</a>. He graduated in 1957, and became as Aircraft Readiness Officer on the staff of the <a href="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</a>, <a href="United%20States%20Fleet%20Forces%20Command">Atlantic Fleet</a>. By this time he had logged more than 3,600 hours of flying time, including 1,700 hours in jets.
On October 4, 1957, the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> launched <a href="Sputnik%201">Sputnik 1</a>, the first artificial <a href="satellite">satellite</a>. This shattered American confidence in its technological superiority, creating a wave of anxiety known as the <a href="Sputnik%20crisis">Sputnik crisis</a>. Among his responses, <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> launched the <a href="Space%20Race">Space Race</a>. The <a href="National%20Aeronautics%20and%20Space%20Administration">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a> (NASA) was established on October 1, 1958, as a civilian agency to develop space technology. One of its first initiatives was publicly announced on December 17, 1958. This was <a href="Project%20Mercury">Project Mercury</a>, which aimed to launch a man into <a href="Earth%20orbit">Earth orbit</a>, return him safely to the Earth, and evaluate his capabilities in space.

NASA received permission from Eisenhower to recruit its first <a href="astronaut">astronaut</a>s from the ranks of military test pilots. The service records of 508 graduates of test pilot schools were obtained from the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">United States Department of Defense</a>. From these, 110 were found that matched the minimum standards: the candidates had to be younger than 40, possess a bachelor's degree or equivalent and to be or less. While these were not all strictly enforced, the height requirement was firm, owing to the size of the Project Mercury spacecraft. The 110 were then split into three groups, with the most promising in the first group.

The first group of 35, which included Shepard, assembled at <a href="the%20Pentagon">the Pentagon</a> on February 2, 1959. The Navy and <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">Marine Corps</a> officers were welcomed by the <a href="Chief%20of%20Naval%20Operations">Chief of Naval Operations</a>, Admiral <a href="Arleigh%20Burke">Arleigh Burke</a>, while the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> officers were addressed by the <a href="Chief%20of%20Staff%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Air%20Force">Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force</a>, <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Thomas%20D.%20White">Thomas D. White</a>. Both pledged their support to the Space Program, and promised that the careers of volunteers would not be adversely affected. NASA officials then briefed them on Project Mercury. They conceded that it would be a hazardous undertaking, but emphasized that it was of great national importance. That evening, Shepard discussed the day's events with fellow naval aviators <a href="Jim%20Lovell">Jim Lovell</a>, <a href="Pete%20Conrad">Pete Conrad</a> and <a href="Wally%20Schirra">Wally Schirra</a>, all of whom would eventually become astronauts. They were concerned about their careers, but decided to volunteer.

The briefing process was repeated with a second group of 34 candidates a week later. Of the 69, six were found to be over the height limit, 15 were eliminated for other reasons, and 16 declined. This left NASA with 32 candidates. Since this was more than expected, NASA decided not to bother with the remaining 41 candidates, as 32 candidates seemed a more than adequate number from which to select 12 astronauts as planned. The degree of interest also indicated that far fewer would drop out during training than anticipated, which would result in training astronauts who would not be required to fly Project Mercury missions. It was therefore decided to cut the number of astronauts selected to just six. Then came a grueling series of physical and psychological tests at the <a href="Lovelace%20Respiratory%20Research%20Institute">Lovelace Clinic</a> and the <a href="Wright-Patterson%20Air%20Force%20Base">Wright Aerospace Medical Laboratory</a>. Only one candidate, Lovell, was eliminated on medical grounds at this stage, and the diagnosis was later found to be in error; thirteen others were recommended with reservations. The director of the NASA <a href="Space%20Task%20Group">Space Task Group</a>, <a href="Robert%20R.%20Gilruth">Robert R. Gilruth</a>, found himself unable to select only six from the remaining eighteen, and ultimately seven were chosen.

Shepard was informed of his selection on April 1, 1959. Two days later he traveled to Boston with Louise for the wedding of his cousin Anne, and was able to break the news to his parents and sister. The identities of the seven were announced at a press conference at <a href="Dolley%20Madison%20House">Dolley Madison House</a> in Washington, D.C., on April 9, 1959: <a href="Scott%20Carpenter">Scott Carpenter</a>, <a href="Gordon%20Cooper">Gordon Cooper</a>, <a href="John%20Glenn">John Glenn</a>, <a href="Gus%20Grissom">Gus Grissom</a>, <a href="Wally%20Schirra">Wally Schirra</a>, Alan Shepard, and <a href="Deke%20Slayton">Deke Slayton</a>. The magnitude of the challenge ahead of them was made clear a few weeks later, on the night of May 18, 1959, when the seven astronauts gathered at <a href="Cape%20Canaveral">Cape Canaveral</a> to watch their first rocket launch, of an <a href="SM-65D%20Atlas">SM-65D Atlas</a>, which was similar to the one that was to carry them into orbit. A few minutes after liftoff, it spectacularly exploded, lighting up the night sky. The astronauts were stunned. Shepard turned to Glenn and said: "Well, I'm glad they got that out of the way."

Faced with intense competition from the other astronauts, particularly John Glenn, Shepard quit smoking and adopted Glenn's habit of taking a morning jog, although he did not go so far as to give up the cocktails or the philandering. On January 19, 1961, Robert R. Gilruth, the director of NASA's Space Task Group, informed the seven astronauts that Shepard had been chosen for the first American manned mission into space. Shepard later recalled Louise's response when he told her that she had her arms around the man who would be the first man in space: "Who let a Russian in here?" During training he flew 120 simulated flights. Although his flight was originally scheduled for April 26, 1960, it was postponed several times by unplanned preparatory work, initially to December 5, 1960, then mid-January 1961, March 6, 1961, April 25, 1961, May 2, 1961, and finally to May 5, 1961. On April 12, 1961, Soviet <a href="cosmonaut">cosmonaut</a> <a href="Yuri%20Gagarin">Yuri Gagarin</a> became the first person in space, and the first to orbit the Earth. It was another body blow to American pride. When Shepard heard the news he slammed his fist down on a table so hard a NASA public relation officer feared he might have broken it.

On May 5, 1961, Shepard piloted the <a href="Mercury-Redstone%203">Mercury-Redstone 3</a> mission and became the second person, and the first American, to travel into space. He named his spacecraft, Mercury Spacecraft 7, "Freedom 7". It was launched atop a <a href="Mercury-Redstone%20Launch%20Vehicle">Redstone rocket</a>. According to <a href="Gene%20Kranz">Gene Kranz</a> in his book "<a href="Failure%20Is%20Not%20an%20Option">Failure Is Not an Option</a>", "When reporters asked Shepard what he thought about as he sat atop the Redstone rocket, waiting for liftoff, he had replied, 'The fact that every part of this ship was built by the lowest bidder.'".

Unlike Gagarin's 108-minute <a href="orbital%20flight">orbital flight</a> in a <a href="Vostok%20%28spacecraft%29">Vostok</a> spacecraft three times the size of "Freedom 7", Shepard stayed on a <a href="sub-orbital%20spaceflight">suborbital</a> trajectory for the 15-minute flight, which reached an altitude of , and then fell to a <a href="splashdown">splashdown</a> down the <a href="Eastern%20Range">Atlantic Missile Range</a>. Unlike Gagarin, whose flight was strictly automatic, Shepard had some control of "Freedom 7", spacecraft <a href="aircraft%20principal%20axes">attitude</a> in particular. Shepard's launch was seen live on television by millions.

One thing that was not seen at the time by the public was Shepard's pre-launch "emergency". Because the entire journey was only expected to take fifteen minutes, Shepard's suit did not have any provision for elimination of bodily wastes. After being strapped into the capsule's seat, launch delays kept him in that suit for eight hours; Shepard's endurance gave out before launch, and he was forced to empty his bladder into the suit, which shorted out the medical sensors attached to it to track the astronaut's condition in flight. After Shepard's flight, NASA called in the space suit's manufacturer, <a href="B.%20F.%20Goodrich">B. F. Goodrich</a>, and by the time of <a href="John%20Glenn">John Glenn</a>'s <a href="Mercury-Atlas%206">Mercury-Atlas 6</a> orbital flight the following year, a liquid waste collection feature had been built into the suit.
After a dramatic <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> recovery, Commander Shepard observed that he "... didn't really feel the flight was a success until the recovery had been successfully completed. It's not the fall that hurts; it's the sudden stop." Splashdown occurred with an impact comparable to landing a jet aircraft on an aircraft carrier. A recovery helicopter arrived after a few minutes, and the capsule was lifted partly out of the water to allow Shepard to leave by the main hatch. He squeezed out of the door and into a sling hoist, and was pulled into the helicopter, which flew both the astronaut and spacecraft to the aircraft carrier . The whole recovery process took just eleven minutes. Shepard was celebrated as a national hero, honored with ticker-tape parades in Washington, New York and Los Angeles, and received the <a href="NASA%20Distinguished%20Service%20Medal">NASA Distinguished Service Medal</a> from President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>. He was also awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a>.

Shepard served as <a href="capsule%20communicator">capsule communicator</a> (CAPCOM) for Glenn's <a href="Mercury-Atlas%206">Mercury-Atlas 6</a> orbital flight, which he had also been considered for, and Carpenter's <a href="Mercury-Atlas%207">Mercury-Atlas 7</a>. He was the backup pilot for Cooper for the <a href="Mercury-Atlas%209">Mercury-Atlas 9</a> mission, nearly replacing Cooper after Cooper flew low over the NASA administration building at Cape Canaveral in an <a href="F-106">F-106</a>. In the final stages of Project Mercury, Shepard was scheduled to pilot the <a href="Mercury-Atlas%2010">Mercury-Atlas 10</a> (MA-10), which was planned as a three-day mission. He named Mercury Spacecraft 15B "Freedom 7 II" in honor of his first spacecraft, and had the name painted on it, but on June 12, 1963, NASA Administrator <a href="James%20E.%20Webb">James E. Webb</a> announced that Mercury had accomplished all its goals and no more missions would be flown. Shepard went as far as making a personal appeal to President Kennedy, but to no avail.

<a href="Project%20Gemini">Project Gemini</a> followed on from Project Mercury, taking its name from the fact that it carried two men instead of just one. After the Mercury-Atlas 10 mission was canceled, Shepard was designated as the commander of the first manned Gemini mission, with <a href="Thomas%20P.%20Stafford">Thomas P. Stafford</a> chosen as his pilot. In late 1963, Shepard began to experience episodes of extreme dizziness and nausea, accompanied by a loud, clanging noise in the left ear. He tried to keep it secret, fearing that he would lose his flight status, but was aware that if an episode occurred in the air or in space it could be fatal. Following an episode during a lecture in Houston, where he had recently moved from <a href="Virginia%20Beach%2C%20Virginia">Virginia Beach, Virginia</a>, Shepard was forced to confess his ailment to Slayton, who was now Director of Flight Operations, and seek help from NASA's doctors.

The doctors diagnosed <a href="M%C3%A9ni%C3%A8re%27s%20disease">Ménière's disease</a>, a condition in which fluid pressure builds up in the inner ear. This syndrome causes the semicircular canals and motion detectors to become extremely sensitive, resulting in disorientation, dizziness, and nausea. There was no known cure, but in about 20 percent of cases the condition went away by itself. They prescribed <a href="diuretic">diuretic</a>s in an attempt to drain the fluid from the ear. They also diagnosed <a href="glaucoma">glaucoma</a>. An X-ray found a lump on his <a href="thyroid">thyroid</a>, and on January 17, 1964, surgeons at <a href="Hermann%20Hospital">Hermann Hospital</a> made an incision on his throat and removed 20 percent of his thyroid. The condition caused Shepard to be removed from flight status. Grissom and <a href="John%20Young%20%28astronaut%29">John Young</a> flew <a href="Gemini%203">Gemini 3</a> instead.

Shepard was designated <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Astronaut%20Office">Chief of the Astronaut Office</a> in November 1963. He thereby became responsible for NASA astronaut training. This involved the development of appropriate training programs for all astronauts and the scheduling of training of individual astronauts for specific missions and roles. He provided and coordinated astronaut input into mission planning and the design of spacecraft and other equipment to be used by astronauts on space missions. He also was on the selection panel for the <a href="NASA%20Astronaut%20Group%205">NASA Astronaut Group 5</a> in 1966. He spent much of his time investing in banks, <a href="wildcatting">wildcatting</a>, and real estate. He became part owner and vice president of Baytown National Bank and would spend hours on the phone in his NASA office overseeing it. He also bought a partnership in a ranch in <a href="Weatherford%2C%20Texas">Weatherford, Texas</a>, that raised horses and cattle. During this period, his secretary had several <a href="head%20shot">head shot</a> photographs taken of Shepard, posed with various expressions on his face. She would post these on the door to his private office, with a sign which said "Mood of the Day". Visitors could then look at the photo to decide whether it was a good time to talk to him. <a href="Tom%20Wolfe">Tom Wolfe</a> characterised Shepard's dual personalities as "Smilin' Al" and the "Icy Commander". "Inside his locker", Wolfe wrote, "he kept Smilin' Al of the Cape!" 

In 1968, Stafford stopped by Shepard's office and told him that an <a href="otologist">otologist</a> in Los Angeles had developed a cure for Ménière's disease. Shepard flew to Los Angeles, where he met with Dr. <a href="William%20F.%20House">William F. House</a>. House proposed to open Shepard's <a href="mastoid%20bone">mastoid bone</a> and make a tiny hole in the <a href="endolymphatic%20sac">endolymphatic sac</a>. A small tube was inserted to drain excess fluid. The surgery was conducted in early 1969 at <a href="St.%20Vincent%20Medical%20Center%20%28Los%20Angeles%29">St. Vincent's Hospital</a> in Los Angeles, where Shepard checked in under the pseudonym of Victor Poulos. The surgery was successful, and he was restored to full flight status on May 7, 1969.

Shepard and Slayton put Shepard down to command the next available Moon mission, which was <a href="Apollo%2013">Apollo 13</a> in 1970. Under normal circumstances, this assignment would have gone to Cooper, as the backup commander of <a href="Apollo%2010">Apollo 10</a>, but Cooper was swept aside. A rookie, <a href="Stuart%20Roosa">Stuart Roosa</a>, was designated the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module%23Command%20Module%20%28CM%29">Command Module</a> Pilot. Shepard asked for <a href="Jim%20McDivitt">Jim McDivitt</a> as his <a href="Lunar%20Module">Lunar Module</a> Pilot, but McDivitt, who had already commanded the <a href="Apollo%209">Apollo 9</a> mission, balked at the prospect, arguing that Shepard did not have sufficient Apollo training to command a Moon mission. A rookie, <a href="Edgar%20Mitchell">Edgar Mitchell</a>, was designated the Lunar Module Pilot instead.
When Slayton submitted the proposed crew assignments to NASA headquarters, <a href="George%20Mueller%20%28NASA%29">George Mueller</a> turned them down on the grounds that the crew was too inexperienced. So Slayton asked Jim Lovell, who had been the backup commander for <a href="Apollo%2011">Apollo 11</a>, and was slated to command <a href="Apollo%2014">Apollo 14</a>, if his crew would be willing to fly Apollo 13 instead. He agreed to do so, and Shepard's inexperienced crew was assigned to Apollo 14.

Neither Shepard nor Lovell expected there would be much difference between Apollo 13 and Apollo 14, but Apollo 13 went disastrously wrong. An oxygen tank explosion caused the Moon landing to be aborted and nearly resulted in the loss of the crew. It became a joke between Shepard and Lovell, who would offer to give Shepard back the mission each time they bumped into each other. The failure of Apollo 13 delayed Apollo 14 until 1971 so that modifications could be made to the spacecraft. The target of the Apollo 14 mission was switched to the <a href="Fra%20Mauro%20formation">Fra Mauro formation</a>, the intended destination of Apollo 13.

Shepard made his second space flight as Commander of Apollo 14 from January 31 to February 9, 1971. It was America's third successful <a href="List%20of%20lunar%20astronauts">lunar landing mission</a>. Shepard piloted the Lunar Module "Antares" to the most accurate landing of the entire Apollo program. He became the fifth and, at the age of 47, the oldest man to walk on the Moon, and the only one of the Mercury Seven astronauts to do so.

This was the first mission to broadcast extensive color television coverage from the lunar surface, using the <a href="Apollo%20TV%20camera%23Westinghouse%20Lunar%20Color%20Camera">Westinghouse Lunar Color Camera</a>. (The same color camera model was used on <a href="Apollo%2012">Apollo 12</a> and provided about 30 minutes of color telecasting before it was inadvertently pointed at the Sun, ending its usefulness.) While on the Moon, Shepard used a Wilson six-iron head attached to a lunar sample scoop handle to drive golf balls. Despite thick gloves and a stiff spacesuit, which forced him to swing the club with one hand, Shepard struck two golf balls, driving the second, as he jokingly put it, "miles and miles and miles".
For this mission Shepard was awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medal and the <a href="Navy%20Distinguished%20Service%20Medal">Navy Distinguished Service Medal</a>. His citation read:

Following Apollo 14, Shepard returned to his position as Chief of the Astronaut Office in June 1971. In July 1971 President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> appointed him as a delegate to the 26th <a href="United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly">United Nations General Assembly</a>, a position in which he served from September to December 1971. He was promoted to <a href="rear%20admiral%20%28United%20States%29">rear admiral</a> by Nixon on August 26, 1971, the first astronaut to reach this rank, although McDivitt had previously been promoted to <a href="brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">brigadier general</a> in the Air Force. He retired from both NASA and the Navy on July 31, 1974.

Shepard was devoted to his children. Frequently Julie, Laura and Alice were the only astronauts' children at NASA events. He taught them to ski and took them skiing in <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>. He once rented a small plane to fly them and their friends from Texas to a <a href="summer%20camp">summer camp</a> in Maine. He doted on his six grandchildren as well. After Apollo 14 he began to spend more time with Louise, and started taking her with him on trips to the <a href="Paris%20Air%20Show">Paris Air Show</a> every other year, and to Asia. Louise heard rumors of his affairs. The publication of Tom Wolfe's 1979 book "<a href="The%20Right%20Stuff%20%28book%29">The Right Stuff</a>" made them public knowledge, but she never confronted him about it, nor did she ever contemplate leaving him.

After Shepard left NASA, he served on the boards of many corporations. He also served as president of his <a href="umbrella%20company">umbrella company</a> for several business enterprises, Seven Fourteen Enterprises, Inc. (named for his two flights, "Freedom 7" and Apollo 14). He made a fortune in banking and real estate. He was a <a href="fellow">fellow</a> of the <a href="American%20Astronautical%20Society">American Astronautical Society</a> and the <a href="Society%20of%20Experimental%20Test%20Pilots">Society of Experimental Test Pilots</a>, a member of <a href="Rotary%20International">Rotary</a>, <a href="Kiwanis">Kiwanis</a>, the <a href="Mayflower%20Society">Mayflower Society</a>, the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Cincinnati">Order of the Cincinnati</a>, and the American Fighter Aces, an honorary member of the <a href="Board%20of%20Directors">Board of Directors</a> for the Houston School for Deaf Children, and a <a href="Board%20of%20directors">director</a> of the <a href="National%20Space%20Institute">National Space Institute</a> and the Los Angeles Ear Research Institute. Together with the other surviving Mercury astronauts, and Betty Grissom, Gus Grissom's widow, in 1984 Shepard founded the Mercury Seven Foundation, which raises money to provide college scholarships to science and engineering students. It was renamed the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation in 1995. Shepard was elected its first president and chairman, positions he held until October 1997, when he was succeeded by former astronaut Jim Lovell.

In 1994, he published a book with two journalists, <a href="Jay%20Barbree">Jay Barbree</a> and Howard Benedict, called "". Fellow Mercury astronaut Deke Slayton is also named as an author. The book included a composite photograph showing Shepard hitting a golf ball on the Moon. There are no still images of this event; the only record is TV footage. The book was turned into a TV <a href="miniseries">miniseries</a> in 1994.

Shepard was diagnosed with <a href="leukemia">leukemia</a> in 1996 and died from complications of the disease in <a href="Pebble%20Beach%2C%20California">Pebble Beach, California</a>, on July 21, 1998. He was the second astronaut who had walked on the Moon to die, <a href="Jim%20Irwin">Jim Irwin</a> being the first, in 1991. Shepard's widow Louise resolved to cremate his remains and scatter the ashes, but she died from a heart attack on August 25, 1998, at 17:00, the time at which he had always called her. They had been married for 53 years. The family decided to cremate them both, and their ashes were scattered together by a Navy helicopter over Stillwater Cove, in front of their Pebble Beach home.

Shepard was awarded the <a href="Congressional%20Space%20Medal%20of%20Honor">Congressional Space Medal of Honor</a> by President <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> on October 1, 1978. He also received the <a href="Golden%20Plate%20Award">Golden Plate Award</a> for Science and Exploration in 1981; the <a href="Langley%20Gold%20Medal">Langley Gold Medal</a> on May 5, 1964; the <a href="John%20J.%20Montgomery%20Award">John J.

He was awarded an <a href="Honorary%20degree">Honorary</a> degrees of <a href="Master%20of%20Arts">Master of Arts</a> from <a href="Dartmouth%20College">Dartmouth College</a> in 1962, <a href="Doctor%20of%20Science">D.Sc.</a> from <a href="Miami%20University">Miami University</a> in 1971, and <a href="Doctor%20of%20Humane%20Letters">Doctorate of Humanities</a> from <a href="Franklin%20Pierce%20University">Franklin Pierce College</a> in 1972. He was inducted into the <a href="National%20Aviation%20Hall%20of%20Fame">National Aviation Hall of Fame</a> in 1977, the <a href="New%20Mexico%20Museum%20of%20Space%20History">International Space Hall of Fame</a> in 1981, and the <a href="U.S.%20Astronaut%20Hall%20of%20Fame">U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame</a> on May 11, 1990.
The Navy named a supply ship, , for him in 2006. The <a href="McAuliffe-Shepard%20Discovery%20Center">McAuliffe-Shepard Discovery Center</a> in <a href="Concord%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Concord</a>, New Hampshire, is named after Shepard and <a href="Christa%20McAuliffe">Christa McAuliffe</a>. <a href="Interstate%2093">Interstate 93</a> in New Hampshire, from the <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> border to <a href="Hooksett%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Hooksett</a>, is designated the Alan B. Shepard Highway, and in <a href="Hampton%2C%20Virginia">Hampton, Virginia</a>, a road is named Commander Shepard Boulevard in his honor. His hometown of Derry has the nickname Space Town in honor of his career as an astronaut. Following an act of Congress, the post office in Derry was designated the Alan B. Shepard Jr. Post Office Building. Alan Shepard Park in <a href="Cocoa%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Cocoa Beach, Florida</a>, a beach-side park south of Cape Canaveral, is named in his honor. The City of Virginia Beach renamed its convention center, with its integral <a href="geodesic%20dome">geodesic dome</a>, the "Alan B. Shepard Convention Center". The building was later renamed the "Alan B. Shepard Civic Center", and was razed in 1994. At the time of the "Freedom 7" launch, Shepard lived in Virginia Beach.

Shepard's high school alma mater in Derry, Pinkerton Academy, has a building named after him, and the school team is called the Astros after his career as an astronaut. Alan B. Shepard High School, in <a href="Palos%20Heights%2C%20Illinois">Palos Heights, Illinois</a>, which opened in 1976, was named in his honor. Framed newspapers throughout the school depict various accomplishments and milestones in Shepard's life. Additionally, an autographed plaque commemorates the dedication of the building. The school newspaper is named "Freedom 7" and the yearbook is entitled "Odyssey". <a href="Blue%20Origin">Blue Origin</a>'s suborbital space tourism rocket, the <a href="New%20Shepard">New Shepard</a>, is named after Shepard.

In a 2010 <a href="Space%20Foundation">Space Foundation</a> survey, Shepard was ranked as the ninth most popular space hero (tied with astronauts <a href="Buzz%20Aldrin">Buzz Aldrin</a> and Gus Grissom). In 2011, NASA honored Shepard with an Ambassador of Exploration Award, consisting of a <a href="Moon%20rock">Moon rock</a> encased in <a href="Poly%28methyl%20methacrylate%29">Lucite</a>, for his contributions to the U.S. space program. His family members accepted the award on his behalf during a ceremony on April 28 at the <a href="U.S.%20Naval%20Academy%20Museum">U.S. Naval Academy Museum</a> in <a href="Annapolis%2C%20Maryland">Annapolis, Maryland</a>, where it is on permanent display. On May 4, 2011, the <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">U.S. Postal Service</a> issued a first-class stamp in Shepard's honor, the first U.S. stamp to depict a specific astronaut. The first day of issue ceremony was held at NASA's <a href="Kennedy%20Space%20Center%20Visitor%20Complex">Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex</a>.

Alan Bush

Alan Dudley Bush (22 December 1900 – 31 October 1995) was a British composer, pianist, conductor, teacher and political activist. A committed <a href="Communism">communist</a>, his uncompromising political beliefs were often reflected in his music. He composed prolifically across a range of genres, but struggled through his lifetime for recognition from the British musical establishment, which largely ignored his works.

Bush, from a prosperous middle-class background, enjoyed considerable success as a student at the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Music">Royal Academy of Music</a> (RAM) in the early 1920s, and spent much of that decade furthering his compositional and piano-playing skills under distinguished tutors. A two-year period in Berlin in 1929 to 1931, early in the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a>'s rise to power, cemented Bush's political convictions and moved him from the mainstream <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> to the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Great%20Britain">Communist Party of Great Britain</a> which he joined in 1935. He wrote several large-scale works in the 1930s, and was heavily involved with workers' choirs for whom he composed pageants, choruses and songs. His pro-<a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> stance led to a temporary ban on his music by the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> in the early years of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, and his refusal to modify his position in the postwar <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> era led to a more prolonged semi-ostracism of his music. As a result, the four major operas he wrote between 1950 and 1970 were all premiered in <a href="East%20Germany">East Germany</a>.

In his prewar works, Bush's style retained what commentators have described as an essential Englishness, but was also influenced by the avant-garde European idioms of the inter-war years. During and after the war he began to simplify this style, in line with his Marxism-inspired belief that music should be accessible to the mass of the people. Despite the difficulties he encountered in getting his works performed in the West he continued to compose until well into his eighties. He taught composition at the RAM for more than 50 years, published two books, was the founder and long-time president of the Workers' Music Association, and served as chairman and later vice-president of the <a href="Composers%27%20Guild%20of%20Great%20Britain">Composers' Guild of Great Britain</a>. His contribution to musical life was slowly recognised, in the form of doctorates from two universities and numerous tribute concerts towards the end of his life. Since his death aged 94 in 1995, his musical legacy has been nurtured by the Alan Bush Music Trust, established in 1997.

Bush was born in <a href="Dulwich">Dulwich</a>, South London, on 22 December 1900, the third and youngest son of Alfred Walter Bush and Alice Maud, née Brinsley. The Bushes were a prosperous middle-class family, their wealth deriving from the firm of industrial chemists founded by the composer's great-grandfather, W. J. Bush. As a child Alan's health was delicate, and he was initially educated at home. When he was eleven he began at <a href="Highgate%20School">Highgate School</a> as a day pupil, and remained there until 1918. Both of his elder brothers served as officers in the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>; one of them, Alfred junior, was killed on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> in 1917. The end of the war in November 1918 meant that Alan narrowly avoided being called up for military service; meantime, having determined on a musical career, he had applied to and been accepted by the RAM, where he began his studies in the spring of 1918.

At the RAM, Bush studied composition under <a href="Frederick%20Corder">Frederick Corder</a> and piano with <a href="Tobias%20Matthay">Tobias Matthay</a>. He made rapid progress, and won various scholarships and awards, including the Thalberg Scholarship, the Phillimore piano prize, and a Carnegie award for composition. He produced the first compositions of his formal canon: Three Pieces for Two Pianos, Op. 1, and Piano Sonata in B minor, Op. 2, and also made his first attempt to write opera – a scene from <a href="Bulwer%20Lytton">Bulwer Lytton</a>'s novel "<a href="The%20Last%20Days%20of%20Pompeii">The Last Days of Pompeii</a>", with a <a href="libretto">libretto</a> by his brother Brinsley. The work, with Bush at the piano, received a single private performance with family members and friends forming the cast. The manuscript was later destroyed by Bush.

Among Bush's fellow students was <a href="Michael%20Head%20%28composer%29">Michael Head</a>. The two became friends, as a result of which Bush met Head's 14-year-old sister Nancy. In 1931, ten years after their first meeting, Bush and Nancy would marry and begin a lifelong artistic partnership in which she became Bush's principal librettist, as well as providing the texts for many of his other vocal works. 
In 1922 Bush graduated from the RAM, but continued to study composition privately under <a href="John%20Ireland%20%28composer%29">John Ireland</a>, with whom he formed an enduring friendship. In 1925 Bush was appointed to a teaching post at the RAM, as a professor of harmony and composition, under terms that gave him scope to continue with his studies and to travel. He began to study piano under <a href="Benno%20Moiseiwitsch">Benno Moiseiwitsch</a>, from whom he learned the <a href="Theodor%20Leschetizky">Leschetizky</a> method. In 1926 he made his first of numerous visits to Berlin, where with the violinist Florence Lockwood he gave two concerts of contemporary, mainly British, music which included his own "Phantasy" in C minor, Op. 3. The skill of the performers was admired by the critics more than the quality of the music. In 1928 Bush returned to Berlin, to perform with the <a href="Antonio%20Brosa">Brosa Quartet</a> at the Bechstein Hall, in a concert of his own music which included the premieres of the chamber work "Five Pieces", Op. 6 and the piano solo "Relinquishment", Op. 11. Critical opinion was broadly favourable, the "Berliner Zeitung am Mittag" correspondent noting "nothing extravagant but much of promise".

Among the works composed by Bush during this period were the Quartet for piano, violin, viola and cello, Op. 5; Prelude and Fugue for piano, Op. 9; settings of poems by <a href="Walter%20de%20la%20Mare">Walter de la Mare</a>, <a href="Harold%20Monro">Harold Monro</a> and <a href="W.%20B.%20Yeats">W. B. Yeats</a>; and his first venture into orchestral music, the Symphonic Impressions of 1926–27, Op. 8. In early 1929 he completed one of his best-known early chamber works, the string quartet "Dialectic", Op. 15, which helped to establish Bush's reputation abroad when it was performed at a Prague festival in the 1930s.

Bush had begun to develop an interest in politics during the war years. In 1924, rejecting his parents' conservatism, he joined the <a href="Independent%20Labour%20Party">Independent Labour Party</a> (ILP). The following year he joined the London Labour Choral Union (LLCU), a group of largely London-based choirs that had been organised by the socialist composer <a href="Rutland%20Boughton">Rutland Boughton</a>, with <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> support, to "develop the musical instincts of the people and to render service to the Labour movement". Bush was soon appointed as Boughton's assistant, and two years later, he succeeded Boughton as the LLCU's chief musical adviser, remaining in this post until the body disbanded in 1940. Through his LLCU work, Bush met <a href="Michael%20Tippett">Michael Tippett</a>, five years his junior, who shared Bush's left-wing political perspective. In his memoirs Tippett records his first impressions of Bush: "I learned much from him. His music at the time seemed so adventurous and vigorous". Tippett's biographer Ian Kemp writes: "Apart from Sibelius, the contemporary composer who taught Tippett as much as anyone else was his own contemporary Alan Bush".

After his 1928 concert tour in Berlin, Bush returned to the city to study piano under <a href="Artur%20Schnabel">Artur Schnabel</a>. He left the ILP in 1929, and joined the Labour Party proper, before taking extended leave from the RAM to begin a two-year course in philosophy and musicology at Berlin's <a href="Humboldt%20University%20of%20Berlin">Friedrich-Wilhelm University</a>. Here, his tutors included <a href="Max%20Dessoir">Max Dessoir</a> and <a href="Friedrich%20Blume">Friedrich Blume</a>. Bush's years in Berlin profoundly affected his political beliefs, and had direct influence on the subsequent character of his music. Michael Jones, writing in "British Music" after Bush's death, records Bush's concern at the rise of fascism and antisemitism in Germany. His association with like-minded musicians such as <a href="Hanns%20Eisler">Hanns Eisler</a> and <a href="Ernst%20Hermann%20Meyer">Ernst Hermann Meyer</a>, and writers such as <a href="Bertold%20Brecht">Bertold Brecht</a>, helped to develop his growing political awareness into a lifelong commitment to Marxism and communism. Bush's conversion to full-blown communism was not immediate, but in 1935 he finally abandoned Labour and joined the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Great%20Britain">British Communist Party</a>.

Notwithstanding the uncompromising nature of his politics, Bush in his writings tended to express his views in restrained terms, "much more like a reforming patrician Whig than a proletarian revolutionary" according to <a href="Michael%20Oliver%20%28writer%2C%20broadcaster%29">Michael Oliver</a> in a 1995 "Gramophone" article. Bush's <a href="Grove%20Music%20Online">Grove Music Online</a> biographers also observe that in the politicisation of his music, his folk idioms have more in common with the English traditions of <a href="Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams">Ralph Vaughan Williams</a> than with the continental radicalism of <a href="Kurt%20Weill">Kurt Weill</a>.

In March 1931 Bush and Nancy were married in London, before returning to Germany where Bush continued his studies. In April a BBC broadcast performance of his Dance Overture for Military Band, Op. 12a, received a mixed reception. Nancy Bush quotes two listeners' comments that appeared in the "<a href="Radio%20Times">Radio Times</a>" on 8 May 1931. One thought that "such a medley of fearful discords could never be called music", while another opined that "[we] should not cry for more Mozart, Haydn or Beethoven if modern composers would all give us sheer beauty like this". 

At the end of summer 1931 the couple returned permanently to England, and settled in the village of <a href="Radlett">Radlett</a>, in <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>. In the following years three daughters were born. Bush resumed his RAM and LLCU duties, and in 1932 accepted a new appointment, as an examiner for the Associated Board of London's Royal Schools of Music, a post which involved extensive overseas travel. These new domestic and professional responsibilities limited Bush's composing activity, but he provided the music for the 1934 Pageant of Labour, organised for the London Trades Council and held at the <a href="The%20Crystal%20Palace">Crystal Palace</a> during October. Tippett, who co-conducted the event, later described it as a "high water mark" in Bush's drive to provide workers' choirs with settings for left-wing texts. In 1936 Bush was one of the founders of the Workers' Musical Association (WMA), and became its first chairman.

In 1935 Bush began work on a piano concerto which, completed in 1937, included the unusual feature of a mixed chorus and baritone soloist in the finale, singing a radical text by <a href="Randall%20Swingler">Randall Swingler</a>. Bush played the piano part when the work was premiered by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under <a href="Sir%20Adrian%20Boult">Sir Adrian Boult</a> on 4 March 1938. The largely left-wing audience responded to the work enthusiastically; Tippett observed that "to counter the radical tendencies of the finale ... Boult forced the applause to end by unexpectedly performing the National Anthem". A performance of the concerto a year later, at the 1939 "Festival of Music for the People", drew caustic comments from <a href="Neville%20Cardus">Neville Cardus</a> in "<a href="The%20Manchester%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>". Cardus saw little direction and no humour in the music: "Why don't these people laugh at themselves now and then? Just for fun."

Bush provided much of the music, and also acted as general director, for the London Co-operative Societies' pageant "Towards Tomorrow", held at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a> on 2 July 1938. In the autumn of that year he visited both the Soviet Union and the United States. Back home in early 1939 he was closely involved in founding and conducting the London String Orchestra, which operated successfully until 1941 and again in the immediate postwar years. He also began to write a major orchestral work, his Symphony No. 1 in C. Amid this busy life Bush was elected a <a href="List%20of%20Royal%20Academy%20of%20Music%20people%23Past%20and%20present%20Fellows%20of%20the%20Royal%20Academy%20of%20Music%20%28FRAM%29">Fellow of the Royal Academy of Music</a>.

When war broke out in September 1939, Bush registered for military service under the National Service (Armed Forces) Act of 1939. He was not called up immediately, and continued his musical life, helping to form the WMA Singers to replace the now-defunct LLCU, and founding the William Morris Music Society. In April 1940 he conducted a <a href="Queen%27s%20Hall">Queen's Hall</a> concert of music by Soviet composers which included the British premieres of <a href="Dmitri%20Shostakovich">Shostakovich</a>'s <a href="Symphony%20No.%205%20%28Shostakovich%29">Fifth Symphony</a>, and <a href="Aram%20Khatchaturian">Khatchaturian</a>'s <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20%28Khachaturian%29">Piano Concerto</a>. <a href="William%20Glock">William Glock</a> in "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" was disdainful, dismissing the Khatachurian concerto as "sixth-rate", and criticising the inordinate length, as he saw it, of the symphony.

Bush was among many musicians, artists and writers who in January 1941 signed up to the communist-led <a href="People%27s%20Convention">People's Convention</a>, which promoted a six-point radical anti-war programme that included friendship with the Soviet Union and "a people's peace". The BBC advised him that because of his association with this movement, he and his music would no longer be broadcast. This action drew strong protests from, among others, <a href="E.%20M.%20Forster">E. M. Forster</a> and <a href="Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams">Ralph Vaughan Williams</a>. The ban was opposed by the prime minister, <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a>, and proved short-lived; it was annulled following the <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">German invasion of the Soviet Union</a> in June 1941.

In November 1941 Bush was conscripted into the army, and after initial training was assigned to the <a href="Royal%20Army%20Medical%20Corps">Royal Army Medical Corps</a>. Based in London, he was given leave to perform in concerts, which enabled him to conduct the premiere of his First Symphony at a BBC Promenade Concert in the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a> on 24 July 1942. He also performed regularly with the London String Orchestra, and in 1944 was the piano soloist in the British premiere of <a href="Dmitri%20Shostakovitch">Shostakovich</a>'s Piano Quintet. His wartime compositions were few; among them were the "Festal Day" Overture, Op. 23, written for Vaughan Williams's 70th birthday in 1942, and several songs and choruses including "Freedom on the March", written for a British-Soviet Unity Demonstration at the Albert Hall on 27 June 1943.

Bush's relatively calm war was marred by the death, in 1944, of his seven-year-old daughter Alice in a road accident. As the war in Europe drew to its end, Bush was posted to the Far East despite being well over the normal age limit for overseas service. The matter was raised in Parliament by the Independent Labour member <a href="D.%20N.%20Pritt">D. N. Pritt</a>, who enquired whether political factors were behind the decision. The posting was withdrawn; and Bush remained in London until his discharge in December 1945.

Bush's return to composing after the war led to what Richard Stoker, in the "<a href="Oxford%20Dictionary%20of%20National%20Biography">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</a>", calls "his best period". However, Bush's attempts to secure a place in the concert repertoire were frustrated. A contributory factor may have been what the critic Dominic Daula calls Bush's "intriguingly unique compositional voice" that challenged critics and audiences alike. But the composer's refusal to modify his pro-Soviet stance following the onset of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> alienated both the public and the music establishment, a factor which Bush acknowledged 20 years later: "People who were in a position to promote my works were afraid to do so. They were afraid of being labelled". Stoker comments that "in a less tolerant country he would certainly have been imprisoned, or worse. But he was merely ignored, both politically, and, which is a pity, as a composer". Nancy Bush writes that the BBC considered him "persona non grata", and imposed an almost complete though unofficial broadcast ban that lasted for some 15 years after the war.

As well as resuming his teaching routines, Bush embarked on a busy schedule of travel, mainly in Eastern Europe with the WMA choir. While in <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a> in August 1947, he and the WMA performed his unaccompanied chorus "Lidice" at the site of the <a href="Lidice">village of that name</a>, which had been destroyed by the Nazis in 1942 in a reprisal for the assassination of <a href="Reinhard%20Heydrich">Reinhard Heydrich</a>.

Among Bush's earliest postwar works was the "English Suite", performed by the revived London String Orchestra at the <a href="Wigmore%20Hall">Wigmore Hall</a> on 9 February 1946. The orchestra had suspended its operations in 1941; after the war, Bush's failure to secure funding for it led to its closure, despite considerable artistic success. Critics noted in the work a change of idiom, away from the European avant-garde character of much of his prewar music and towards a simpler popular style. This change was acknowledged by Bush as he responded to the 1948 decree issued by <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Stalin</a>'s director of cultural policy, <a href="Andrei%20Zhdanov">Andrei Zhdanov</a>, against <a href="Formalism%20%28music%29">formalism</a> and <a href="Consonance%20and%20dissonance%23Dissonance">dissonance</a> in modern music – although the process of simplification had probably begun during the war years.

In 1948 Bush accepted a commission from the Nottingham Co-operative Society to write a symphony as part of the city's quincentennial celebrations in 1949. > According to Foreman, "by any standards this is one of Bush's most approachable scores", yet since its Nottingham premiere on 27 June 1949 and its London debut on 11 December 1952 under Boult and the London Philharmonic, the work has been rarely heard in Britain. His Violin Concerto, Op. 32, received its premiere on 25 August 1949, with <a href="Max%20Rostal">Max Rostal</a> as soloist. In this work Bush explained that "the soloist represents the individual, the orchestra world society, and the work [represents] the individual's struggles and of his final absorption into society". "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>"s critic observed that "it was the orchestra, i.e. society, that after a strenuous opening gave up the struggle".

In 1947 Bush became chairman of the <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Songwriters%2C%20Composers%20and%20Authors">Composers' Guild of Great Britain</a> for 1947–48. He also produced a full-length textbook, "Strict Counterpoint in the Palestrina Style" (Joseph Williams, London, 1948). On 15 December 1950 the WMA marked Bush's 50th birthday with a special concert of his music at the <a href="Conway%20Hall%20Ethical%20Society%23Conway%20Hall">Conway Hall</a>.

Since his youthful "Last Days of Pompeii", Bush had not attempted to write opera, but he took up the genre in 1946 with a short operetta for children, "The Press Gang (or the Escap'd Apprentice)", for which Nancy supplied the libretto. This was performed by pupils at <a href="St%20Christopher%20School%2C%20Letchworth">St Christopher School, Letchworth</a>, on 7 March 1947. The following year he began a more ambitious venture, a full-length grand opera recounting the story of <a href="Wat%20Tyler">Wat Tyler</a>, who led the <a href="Peasants%27%20Revolt">Peasants' Revolt</a> of 1381. "Wat Tyler", again to Nancy's libretto, was submitted in 1950 to the Arts Council's <a href="Festival%20of%20Britain">Festival of Britain</a> opera competition, and was one of four prizewinners – Bush received £400. The opera was not taken up by any of the British opera houses, and was first staged at <a href="Leipzig%20Opera">Leipzig Opera</a> in 1953. It was well received, retained for the season and ran again in the following year; there was a further performance in Rostock in 1955. "Wat Tyler" did not receive its full British premiere until 19 June 1974, when it was produced at <a href="Sadler%27s%20Wells">Sadler's Wells</a>; as of 2017, this remains the only professional staging of a Bush opera in Britain.

Bush's second opera, "Men of Blackmoor", composed in 1954–55 to Nancy's libretto, is a story of <a href="Northumberland">Northumbrian</a> miners in the early 19th century; Bush went down a mine as part of his research. It received its premiere at the German National Theatre, Weimar on 18 November 1956. Like "Wat Tyler" in Leipzig, the opera was successful; after the Weimar season there were further East German productions in <a href="Jena">Jena</a> (1957), Leipzig (1959) and <a href="Zwickau">Zwickau</a> (1960). In Britain there were student performances at Oxford in 1960, and Bristol in 1974. In December 1960 David Drew in the "New Statesman" wrote: "The chief virtue of "Men of Blackmoor", and the reason why it particularly deserves a [professional] performance at this historical point, is its unfailing honesty ... it is never cheap, and at its best achieves a genuine dignity."

For his third opera, Bush chose a contemporary theme – the struggle against colonial rule. He intended to collect appropriate musical material from <a href="Guyana">British Guiana</a>, but an attempt to visit the colony in 1957 was thwarted when its government refused him entry. The ban was rescinded the following year, and in 1959 Bush was able to gather and record a great deal of authentic music from the local African and Indian populations. The eventual result was "The Sugar Reapers", premiered at Leipzig on 11 December 1966. "The Times" correspondent, praising the performance, wrote: "One can only hope that London will soon see a production of its own". With Nancy, Bush wrote two more operettas for children: "The Spell Unbound" (1953) and "The Ferryman's Daughter" (1961). His final opera, written in 1965–67, was "Joe Hill", based on the life story of <a href="Joe%20Hill">Joe Hill</a>, an American union activist and songwriter who was controversially convicted of murder and executed in 1915. The opera, to a libretto by Barrie Stavis, was premiered at the German State Opera, Berlin, on 29 September 1970, and in 1979 was broadcast by the BBC.

During his involvement with opera, Bush continued to compose in other genres. His 1953 cantata "Voice of the Prophets", Op. 41, was commissioned by the tenor <a href="Peter%20Pears">Peter Pears</a> and sung by Pears at its premiere on 22 May 1953. In 1959–60 he produced two major orchestral works: the "Dorian Passacaglia and Fugue", Op. 52, and the Third Symphony, Op. 53, known as the "Byron" since it depicts musically scenes from the <a href="Lord%20Byron">life of the poet</a>. The symphony, a commission from East German Radio, was first performed at Leipzig on 20 March 1962. Colin Mason, writing in "The Guardian", thought the work had a stronger socialist programme than the Nottingman symphony of 1949. The ending of the second movement, a long tune representing Byron's speech against the extension of the death penalty was, Mason wrote, "a splendid piece". The symphony was awarded that year's Händel Prize in the city of <a href="Halle%20%28Saale%29">Halle</a>.

At the end of the 1960s Bush wrote, among other works, "Time Remembered", Op. 67, for chamber orchestra, and "Scherzo for Wind Orchestra and Percussion", Op. 68, based on an original Guyanese theme. In 1969 he produced the first of three song cycles, "The Freight of Harvest", Op. 69 – "Life's Span" and "Woman's Life" would follow in 1974 and 1977. In the 1970s, while maintaining his teaching commitment to the RAM, he continued to perform in the concert hall as conductor and pianist. Bush was slowly being recognised for his achievements, even by those who had long cold-shouldered him. In 1968 he was awarded a <a href="Doctor%20of%20Music">Doctor of Music</a> degree by the <a href="University%20of%20London">University of London</a>, and two years later received an <a href="Honorary%20degree">honorary doctorate</a> from the <a href="University%20of%20Durham">University of Durham</a>. On 6 December 1970, just before Bush's 70th birthday, BBC Television broadcast a programme about his life and works, and on 16 February 1971 the RAM hosted a special (late) birthday concert, in which he and Pears performed songs from "Voices of the Prophets". Bush featured in a further television programme, broadcast on 25 October 1975, in a series entitled "Born in 1900".

In old age, Bush continued to lead an active and productive life, punctuated by periodic commemorations of his life and works. In November 1975 his 50 years' professorship at the RAM was marked in a concert there, and in January 1976 the WMA gave a concert to honour his recent 75th birthday. In 1977 he produced his last major piano work, the "Twenty-four Preludes", Op. 84, of which he gave the first performance at the Wigmore Hall on 30 October 1977. A later reviewer described this piece as "music I'd like to have playing beside me as I sprawled on the grass beneath the trees with an ice-cream, watching a county cricket match on a golden afternoon".

In 1978 Bush retired from the RAM after 52 years' service. His 80th birthday in December 1980 was celebrated at concerts in London, Birmingham and East Germany, and the BBC broadcast a special birthday musical tribute. In the same year he published "In My Eighth Decade and Other Essays", in which he stated his personal creed that "as a musician and as a man, Marxism is a guide to action", enabling him to express through music the "struggle to create a condition of social organisation in which science and art will be the possession of all". In 1982 Bush visited the <a href="Lascaux">Lascaux</a> caves in south-western France, and was inspired by the prehistoric cave paintings to write his fourth and final symphony, Op. 94, subtitled the "Lascaux". This, his last major orchestral work, was premiered by the <a href="BBC%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">BBC Philharmonic Orchestra</a>, under <a href="Edward%20Downes">Edward Downes</a> in Manchester, on 25 March 1986.

In the late 1980s Bush was increasingly hampered by failing eyesight. His last formal compositions appeared in 1988: "Spring Woodland and Summer Garden" for solo piano, Op. 124, and "Summer Valley" for cello and piano, Op. 125, although he continued to compose privately and play the piano. Nancy's health meanwhile deteriorated, and she died on 12 October 1991. Bush lived on quietly at Radlett for another four years, able to recall the events of his youth but with no memory of the last fifty years and unaware of the <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">collapse of the Soviet Union</a> in 1991. He died in Watford General hospital on 31 October 1995, after a short illness, at the age of 94.

Despite undergoing various changes of emphasis, Bush's music retained a voice distinct from that of any of his contemporaries. One critic describes the typical Bush sound as "Mild dominant discords, of consonant effect, used with great originality in uncommon progressions alive with swift, purposeful harmonic movement ... except in [Benjamin] Britten they are nowhere used with more telling expression, colour and sense of movement than in Bush".

John Ireland, Bush's early mentor, instilled "the sophisticated and restrained craftsmanship which marked Bush's music from the beginning", introducing him to folksong and <a href="Giovanni%20Pierluigi%20da%20Palestrina">Palestrina</a>, both important building blocks in the development of Bush's mature style. Daula comments that "Bush's music does not [merely] imitate the sound-world of his Renaissance predecessors", but creates his unique fingerprint by "[juxtaposing] 16th century modal counterpoint with late- and post-romantic harmony".

Bush's music, at least from the mid-1930s, often carried political overtones. His obituarist Rupert Christiansen writes that, as a principled Marxist, Bush "put the requirements of the revolutionary proletariat at the head of the composer's responsibilities", a choice which others, such as Tippett, chose not to make. However, Vaughan Williams thought that, despite Bush's oft-declared theories of the purposes of art and music, "when the inspiration comes over him he forgets all about this and remembers only the one eternal rule for all artists, 'To thine own self be true'."

According to Duncan Hall's account of the music culture of the Labour Movement in the inter-war years, Bush's youthful music, composed before his Berlin sojourn, already demonstrated its essential character. His "Dialectic for String Quartet" (1929), Op. 15, created a strong impression when first heard in 1935, as "a musical discourse of driving intensity and virile incident". Christiansen highlights its "tightness and austerity" in contrast to the more fashionable lyricism then prevalent in English music.

Bush's years in Berlin brought into his music the advanced Central European idioms that characterise his major orchestral compositions of the period: the Piano Concerto (1935–37), and the First Symphony (1939–40). Nancy Bush describes the Piano Concerto as Bush's first attempt to fuse his musical and political ideas. The symphony was even more overtly political, representing in its three movements greed (of the bourgeoisie), frustration (of the proletariat) and the final liberation of the latter, but not, according to Christiansen, "in an idiom calculated to appeal to the masses".

Aside from these large-scale works, much of Bush's compositional activity in the 1930s was devoted to pageants, songs and choruses written for his choirs, work undertaken with the utmost seriousness. In his introduction to a 1938 socialist song book, Bush wrote that "socialists must sing what we mean and sing it like we mean it". Under Bush's influence the "music of the workers" moved from the high aesthetic represented by, for example, <a href="Arthur%20Bourchier">Arthur Bourchier</a>'s mid-1920s pamphlet "Art and Culture in Relation to Socialism", towards an expression with broader popular appeal.

Although Bush accepted Zhdanov's 1948 diktat without demur and acted accordingly, his postwar simplifications had begun earlier and would continue as part of a gradual process. Bush first outlined the basis of his new method of composition in an article, "The Crisis of Modern Music", which appeared in WMA's "Keynote" magazine in spring 1946. The method, in which every note has thematic significance, has drawn comparison by critics with <a href="Arnold%20Schoenberg">Schoenberg</a>'s <a href="Twelve-tone%20technique">twelve-note system</a>, although Bush rejected this equation.

Many of Bush's best-known works were written in the immediate postwar years. <a href="Anthony%20Payne">Anthony Payne</a> described the "Three Concert Studies for Piano Trio" (Op. 31) of 1947 as exceeding Britten in its inventiveness, "a high-water mark in Bush's mature art". The Violin Concerto (Op. 32, 1948) has been cited as "a work as beautiful and refined as any in the genre since Walton's". Foreman considers the concerto, which uses twelve-tone themes, to be the epitome of Bush's thematic theory of composition, although Bush's contemporary, <a href="Edmund%20Rubbra">Edmund Rubbra</a>, thought it too intellectual for general audiences. The "Dorian Passacaglia and Fugue" for timpani, percussion and strings, (Op. 52, 1959), involves eight variations in the <a href="Dorian%20mode">Dorian mode</a>, followed by eight in other modes culminating in a final quadruple fugue in six parts. "Musical Opinion"s critic praised the composer's "wonderful control and splendid craftsmanship" in this piece, and predicted that it could become the most popular of all Bush's orchestral works. 

The postwar period also saw the beginning of Bush's 20-year involvement with grand opera, a genre in which, although he achieved little commercial recognition, he was retrospectively hailed by critics as a master of British opera second only to Britten. His first venture, "Wat Tyler", was written in a form which Bush thought acceptable to the general British public; it was not his choice, he wrote, that the opera and its successors all found their initial audiences in East Germany. When eventually staged in Britain in 1974 the opera, although well received at Sadler's Wells, seemed somewhat old-fashioned; <a href="Philip%20Hope-Wallace">Philip Hope-Wallace</a> in "The Guardian" thought the ending degenerated into "a choral union cantata", and found the music pleasant but not especially memorable. Bush's three other major operas were all characterised by their use of "local" music: Northumbrian folk-song in the case of "Men of Blackmoor", Guyanese songs and dances in "The Sugar Reapers", and American folk music in "Joe Hill" – the last-named used in a manner reminiscent of Kurt Weill and the German opera with which Bush had become familiar in the early 1930s.

The extent to which Bush's music changed substantially after the war was addressed by Meirion Bowen, reviewing a Bush concert in the 1980s. Bowen noted a distinct contrast between early and late works, the former showing primarily the influences of Ireland and of Bush's European contacts, while in the later pieces the idiom was "often overtly folklike and Vaughan Williams-ish". In general Bush's late works continued to show all the hallmarks of his postwar oeuvre: vigour, clarity of tone and masterful use of counterpoint. The Lascaux symphony, written when he was 83, is the composer's final major orchestral statement, and addresses deep philosophical issues relating to the origins and destiny of mankind.

In the 1920s it appeared that Bush might emerge as Britain's foremost pianist, after his studies under the leading teachers of the day, but he turned to composition as his principal musical activity. In Foreman's summary he is "a major figure who really straddles the century as almost no other composer does". He remained a pianist of consequence, with a strong and reliable, if heavy, touch.

Joanna Bullivant, writing in "Music and Letters", maintains that in his music Bush subordinated all ideas of personal expression to the ideology of Marxism. The critic Hugo Cole thought that, as a composer, Bush came close to <a href="Paul%20Hindemith">Paul Hindemith</a>'s ideal: "one for whom music is felt as a moral and social force, and only incidentally as a means of personal expression". The composer <a href="Wilfrid%20Mellers">Wilfrid Mellers</a> credits Bush with more than ideological correctness; while remaining faithful to his creed even when it was entirely out of fashion, he "attempt[ed] to re-establish an English tradition meaningful to his country's past, present and future". Hall describes Bush as "a key figure in the democratisation of art in Britain, achieving far more in this regard than his pedagogic, utopian patrons and peers, the labour romantics."

The music critic Colin Mason described Bush's music thus:His range is wide, the quality of his music consistently excellent. He has the intellectual concentration of Tippett, the easy command and expansiveness of Walton, the nervous intensity of Rawsthorne, the serene leisureliness of Rubbra ... He is surpassed only in melody, as are the others, by Walton, but not even by him in harmonic richness, nor by Tippett in contrapuntal originality and the expressive power of rather austere musical thought, nor by Rawsthorne in concise, compelling utterance and telling invention, nor by Rubbra in handling large forms well.

Bush's long career as a teacher influenced generations of English composers and performers. Tippett was never a formal pupil, but has acknowledged a deep debt to Bush. <a href="Herbert%20Murrill">Herbert Murrill</a>, a pupil of Bush's at the RAM in the 1920s, wrote in 1950 of his tutor: "[T]here is humility in his makeup, and I believe that no man can achieve greatness in the arts without humility ... To Alan Bush I owe much, not least the artistic strength and right to differ from him". Among postwar Bush students who later led distinguished careers are the composers <a href="Edward%20Gregson">Edward Gregson</a>, <a href="Roger%20Steptoe">Roger Steptoe</a> and <a href="Michael%20Nyman">Michael Nyman</a>, and the pianists <a href="John%20Bingham%20%28pianist%29">John Bingham</a> and <a href="Graham%20Johnson%20%28musician%29">Graham Johnson</a>. Through his sponsorship of the London String Quartet Bush helped launch the careers of string players such as <a href="Norbert%20Brainin">Norbert Brainin</a> and <a href="Emanuel%20Hurwitz">Emanuel Hurwitz</a>, both of whom later achieved international recognition.

Bush's music was under-represented in the concert repertoire in his lifetime, and virtually disappeared after his death. The 2000 centenary of his birth was markedly low key; the Prom season ignored him, although there was a memorial concert at the Wigmore Hall on 1 November, and a BBC broadcast of the Piano Concerto on 19 December. The centenary, albeit quietly observed, helped to introduce the name and music of Bush to a new generation of music lovers, and generated an increase in both performance and recordings. The centenary also heralded an awakening of scholarly interest in Bush, whose life and works were the subject of numerous PhD theses in the early 20th century. Scholars such as Paul Harper-Scott and Joanna Bullivant have obtained access to new material, including documents released since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and Bush's MI5 file. This, says Bullivant, enables a more informed assessment of the interrelationships within Bush's music and his communism, and of the inherent conflicting priorities.

In October 1997 family members and friends founded The Alan Bush Music Trust "to promote the education and appreciation by the public in and of music and, in particular, the works of the British composer Alan Bush". The trust provides a newsletter, features news stories, promotes performances and recordings of Bush's works, and through its website reproduces wide-ranging critical and biographical material.
It continues to monitor concert performances of Bush's works, and other Bush-related events, at home and abroad.

At the time of Bush's centenary, Martin Anderson, writing in the British Music Information Centre's newsletter, summarised Bush's compositional career:

Bush was not a natural melodist à la Dvorák, though he could produce an appealing tune when he set his mind to it. But he was a first-rate contrapuntist, and his harmonic world can glow with a rare internal warmth. It would be foolish to claim that everything he wrote was a masterpiece – and equally idiotic to turn our backs on the many outstanding scores still awaiting assiduous attention.

Before Bush's centenary year, 2000, the few available recordings of his music included none of the major works. In the 21st century much has been added, including recordings of Symphonies 1, 2 and 4, the Piano and Violin Concertos, many of the main vocal works and the complete organ works.

Troy McClure

Troy McClure is a <a href="fictional%20character">fictional character</a> in the American animated sitcom "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>". He was originally <a href="voice%20acting">voiced</a> by <a href="Phil%20Hartman">Phil Hartman</a> and first appeared in the <a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%202%29">second season</a> episode "<a href="Homer%20vs.%20Lisa%20and%20the%208th%20Commandment">Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment</a>". McClure is an actor who is usually shown doing low-level work, such as hosting infomercials and educational films. He appears as the main character in "<a href="A%20Fish%20Called%20Selma">A Fish Called Selma</a>", in which he marries <a href="Patty%20and%20Selma%20Bouvier">Selma Bouvier</a> to aid his failing career and quash rumors about his personal life. McClure also 'hosts' "<a href="The%20Simpsons%20138th%20Episode%20Spectacular">The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular</a>" and "<a href="The%20Simpsons%20Spin-Off%20Showcase">The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase</a>".

McClure was partially based on B movie actors <a href="Troy%20Donahue">Troy Donahue</a> and <a href="Doug%20McClure">Doug McClure</a>, as well as Hartman himself. Following Hartman's murder in 1998, two of his "Simpsons" characters were retired, with Hartman's final appearance as McClure in the <a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%2010%29">tenth season</a> episode "<a href="Bart%20the%20Mother">Bart the Mother</a>" four months later. Since his retirement, McClure has often been cited as one of the series' most popular characters. In 2006, <a href="IGN">IGN</a> ranked McClure No. 1 on their list of the "Top 25 "Simpsons" Peripheral Characters".

Troy McClure is a stereotypical <a href="Hollywood%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Hollywood</a> has-been. He was a star in the early 1970s, but his career went downhill due to rumors of a <a href="paraphilia">paraphilia</a> involving fish. In most of his appearances in the show, he hosts short video clips that other characters watch on television or in a public place. He often presents educational videos and <a href="infomercial">infomercial</a>s. McClure introduces himself by saying, "Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such [films, educational videos, voiceovers, etc.] as...," mentioning two titles that are similar to his current performance. For example, in the episode "<a href="Bart%20the%20Mother">Bart the Mother</a>", McClure introduces a film about birds by saying, "Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such nature films as "Earwigs: Eww!" and "Man vs. Nature: The Road to Victory"."

McClure's most prominent role occurs in the seventh-season episode "<a href="A%20Fish%20Called%20Selma">A Fish Called Selma</a>". In the episode, McClure begins a relationship with <a href="Selma%20Bouvier">Selma Bouvier</a>, whom he meets when she gives him an eye test at the <a href="Department%20of%20Motor%20Vehicles">Department of Motor Vehicles</a>. The relationship revives his career, leading him to star in "Stop the Planet of the Apes, I Want to Get Off!", a stage musical version of the film "<a href="Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%20%281968%20film%29">Planet of the Apes</a>". To further boost McClure's career, McClure's agent suggests that he get married. Unaware of McClure's motivation, Selma accepts his proposal, and moves into McClure's house, a <a href="Modern%20architecture">Modernist</a> building which resembles the <a href="Chemosphere">Chemosphere</a>. At his <a href="bachelor%20party">bachelor party</a>, a drunken McClure tells <a href="Homer%20Simpson">Homer Simpson</a> that the marriage is just a sham to help his career. Homer says nothing at the wedding, but later offhandedly mentions McClure's admission to <a href="Marge%20Simpson">Marge</a>, who then informs her sister. Selma decides to remain with McClure anyway, but she becomes disturbed when McClure's agent advises the pair to have a child (since "all the big parts these days are going to family men"). Having a child will secure McClure's casting as McBain's sidekick in "McBain IV: Fatal Discharge", but Selma is unwilling to bring a child into a loveless relationship and decides to leave McClure. McClure ultimately gets the role, but turns it down in order to direct and star in his own pet project, a <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a> film called "The Contrabulous Fabtraption of Professor Horatio Hufnagel".

In addition to his in-story appearances, McClure appears as host of "<a href="The%20Simpsons%20138th%20Episode%20Spectacular">The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular</a>" and "<a href="The%20Simpsons%20Spin-Off%20Showcase">The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase</a>". The first is a behind-the-scenes look at "The Simpsons", answering questions and featuring extra "never-before-seen" material. The second is an episode presenting three possible spin-offs from "The Simpsons".

McClure was made into an action figure as part of the "<a href="World%20of%20Springfield">World of Springfield</a>" toy line, and was released in the "Celebrity Series 1" wave. He also features briefly in the video game "<a href="Virtual%20Springfield">Virtual Springfield</a>", introducing the town of <a href="Springfield%20%28The%20Simpsons%29">Springfield</a> to the player.

McClure was based on the typical "washed up" Hollywood actor. <a href="B%20movie">B movie</a> actors <a href="Troy%20Donahue">Troy Donahue</a> and <a href="Doug%20McClure">Doug McClure</a> served as inspiration for his name and certain character aspects. McClure found the homage funny and his children called him "Troy McClure" when his back was turned. According to show creator <a href="Matt%20Groening">Matt Groening</a>, <a href="Phil%20Hartman">Phil Hartman</a> was cast in the role due to his ability to pull "the maximum amount of humor" out of any line he was given. McClure's visual appearance is similar to that of Hartman himself. When he was designed, McClure was given an extra line under his eyes to suggest that the character had gotten a <a href="facelift">facelift</a>.

In a very brief appearance in the <a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%202%29">season 2</a> episode <a href="Bart%27s%20Dog%20Gets%20an%20%26quot%3BF%26quot%3B">Bart's Dog Gets an "F"</a>, Troy was voiced by <a href="Dan%20Castellaneta">Dan Castellaneta</a>.

According to executive producer <a href="Al%20Jean">Al Jean</a>, the writers often used McClure as a "panic button" and added the character when they felt an episode needed more humor.

McClure's character is most developed in "A Fish Called Selma", which provides a more in-depth look into his private life and backstory. <a href="Showrunner">Showrunner</a>s <a href="Bill%20Oakley">Bill Oakley</a> and <a href="Josh%20Weinstein">Josh Weinstein</a> were fans of Hartman, and wished to make an episode entirely about McClure in order to give Hartman as much to do as possible. From this came the idea of McClure's marriage to <a href="Selma%20Bouvier">Selma Bouvier</a>, as she was "always marrying people". Animator <a href="Mark%20Kirkland">Mark Kirkland</a> was particularly pleased that McClure was the star of the episode. He enjoyed interpreting Hartman's voice-over performances, and the episode allowed him and the other animators to "open [McClure] up visually as a character".

Throughout "A Fish Called Selma", it is hinted that McClure engages in strange sexual behavior. The writers did not initially know what the "unsavory" sexual preference would be, but eventually decided on a fish fetish, using a suggestion from executive producer <a href="James%20L.%20Brooks">James L. Brooks</a>. Josh Weinstein described the fish fetish concept as "so perverted and strange, it was over the top".

After Hartman's murder in 1998, rather than replace him with a new voice actor, the production staff retired McClure, along with Hartman's other recurring character, <a href="Lionel%20Hutz">Lionel Hutz</a>, from the show. McClure last appeared in the season ten episode "<a href="Bart%20the%20Mother">Bart the Mother</a>", which was dedicated to Hartman. Before his death, Hartman had often expressed an interest in starring in a live-action film about McClure, which would be penned by some of the show's writers. He noted that he was "looking forward to his live-action movie, publicizing [McClure's] <a href="Betty%20Ford%20Center">Betty Ford</a> appearances." <a href="Matt%20Groening">Matt Groening</a> later told "<a href="Empire%20%28magazine%29">Empire</a>" that the idea never "got further than enthusiasm", but "would have been really fun".

Even after his retirement, Troy McClure remains a popular supporting character. <a href="IGN">IGN</a> ranked McClure first in their 2006 list of the "Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters", calling him "a wonderfully bizarre and entertaining character that showcases the best of what small roles on The Simpsons can be". In a 2007 article on "Simpsons" guest stars, Adam Finley of <a href="TV%20Squad">TV Squad</a> wrote that McClure was "responsible for some of the funniest moments in "Simpsons" history". Hartman ranked first on <a href="AOL">AOL</a>'s list of their favorite 25 "Simpsons" guest stars. <a href="Chris%20Turner%20%28author%29">Chris Turner</a> argues in "<a href="Planet%20Simpson">Planet Simpson</a>" that McClure and <a href="Lionel%20Hutz">Lionel Hutz</a> "together...represent the most significant contribution to the show outside of its permanent cast", adding that "the show's Golden Age is hard to imagine without them". He continues, "The smarmy Hollywood type...has been done to death, but Hartman's version breathed new life into it with each appearance. McClure has become the <a href="apotheosis">apotheosis</a> of the stereotype, a gut-achingly funny reinterpretation whose trademark introduction...has become a shorthand way to describe any grossly artificial media figure."

McClure's most prominent episode, "<a href="A%20Fish%20Called%20Selma">A Fish Called Selma</a>", is a favorite of many of the show's staff members, and has been cited as one of the series' best episodes by several publications. "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" placed the episode eighth on their top 25 "The Simpsons" episode list, and IGN named the episode the best of the <a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%207%29">seventh season</a>, calling it the "obvious pick". They also deemed McClure's "Planet of the Apes" musical the best moment of the episode and "maybe even the whole show".

McClure was one of Phil Hartman's best known-roles. He often used his McClure voice to entertain the audience between takes while taping episodes of "<a href="NewsRadio">NewsRadio</a>". He remarked, "My favorite fans are Troy McClure fans." He added "It's the one thing that I do in my life that's almost an avocation. I do it for the pure love of it." Many obituaries of Hartman mentioned his work as McClure as one of the highlights of his career. The <a href="BBC">BBC</a> said that "[Hartman's] voice was known to millions" because of McClure and Lionel Hutz.

The title of a song on American indie-rock band <a href="Yo%20La%20Tengo">Yo La Tengo</a>'s ninth full-length album, "<a href="And%20Then%20Nothing%20Turned%20Itself%20Inside-Out">And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out</a>", "Let's Save Tony Orlando's House", is based upon a telethon that McClure hosts in the episode "<a href="Marge%20on%20the%20Lam">Marge on the Lam</a>". In an interview with the <a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">A.V. Club</a>, <a href="Ira%20Kaplan">Ira Kaplan</a>, the singer and guitarist of Yo La Tengo, states that <a href="James%20McNew">James McNew</a>, the band's bassist, titled a series of instrumentals used to develop the album based upon the Troy McClure filmography.

Sideshow Bob

Robert Underdunk Terwilliger Jr., <a href="Doctor%20of%20Philosophy">PhD</a>, better known as Sideshow Bob, is a <a href="recurring%20character">recurring character</a> in the animated television series "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>." He is voiced by <a href="Kelsey%20Grammer">Kelsey Grammer</a> and first appeared briefly in the episode "<a href="The%20Telltale%20Head">The Telltale Head</a>". Bob is a self-proclaimed genius who is a graduate of <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a>, a member of the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a>, and a champion of <a href="high%20culture">high culture</a>. He began his career as a sidekick on <a href="Krusty%20the%20Clown">Krusty the Clown</a>'s television show, but after enduring constant abuse, Bob attempted to frame his employer for armed robbery in "<a href="Krusty%20Gets%20Busted">Krusty Gets Busted</a>". The plan was foiled by his arch-enemy, <a href="Bart%20Simpson">Bart Simpson</a>, and Sideshow Bob was sent to prison.

Bob made his second major appearance in <a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%203%29">season three</a>'s "<a href="Black%20Widower">Black Widower</a>"; the writers echoed the premise of the <a href="Wile%20E.%20Coyote%20and%20Road%20Runner">Coyote chasing the Road Runner</a> by having Bob unexpectedly insert himself into Bart's life, threatening to disrupt – and sometimes end – it. In each appearance thereafter, Bob has assumed the role on "The Simpsons" of an <a href="Villain%23The%20evil%20genius%20villain">evil genius</a>. Episodes in which he is a central character typically involve Sideshow Bob being released from prison and executing an elaborate revenge plan, usually foiled by Bart and <a href="Lisa%20Simpson">Lisa</a>. His plans often involve murder and destruction, usually targeted at Bart or, less often, Krusty, though these plans often involve targeting the entire Simpson family. In 2015, however, during the "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20%28series%29">Treehouse of Horror</a>" segment, "Wanted: Dead, Then Alive", Bob finally gets his wish of killing Bart, commenting that he spent 24 years trying to kill a ten-year-old child; however, he becomes bored with Bart dead, so he brings him back to life so that he can repeatedly kill Bart over and over again.

Sideshow Bob shares some personality traits of Grammer's character <a href="Frasier%20Crane">Frasier Crane</a> from the sitcoms "<a href="Cheers">Cheers</a>" and "<a href="Frasier">Frasier</a>", and has been described as "Frasier pickled in arsenic". Several parallels have been explicitly drawn in "The Simpsons" between Bob and Frasier Crane – Bob's brother Cecil and his father were played by <a href="David%20Hyde%20Pierce">David Hyde Pierce</a> and <a href="John%20Mahoney">John Mahoney</a> respectively, echoing the roles they played in "Frasier". Grammer, who based Bob's voice on that of actor <a href="Ellis%20Rabb">Ellis Rabb</a>, has been praised for his portrayals of the character. In 2006, he won an Emmy for <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Voice-Over%20Performance">Outstanding Voice-Over Performance</a> for his work in the episode "<a href="The%20Italian%20Bob">The Italian Bob</a>".

As of December 2017, Bob has had speaking appearances in 20 episodes and been featured in 13; the most recent of the latter, "<a href="Gone%20Boy">Gone Boy</a>", aired during <a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%2029%29">the 29th season</a>. In addition to his recurring role in the series, Sideshow Bob has made several appearances in other "Simpsons" media. He appears in the <a href="List%20of%20The%20Simpsons%20comics%23Simpsons%20Comics">"Simpsons Comics"</a>, cameos in the 2007 video game "<a href="The%20Simpsons%20Game">The Simpsons Game</a>", and stars as the main antagonist in <a href="The%20Simpsons%20Ride">"The Simpsons" Ride</a> at Universal Studios' theme parks. A lover of <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a> <a href="operetta">operetta</a>s, Sideshow Bob is also known for his singing voice; several of Grammer's performances have been included in <a href="The%20Simpsons%20discography">"The Simpsons" musical compilations</a>.

The character of Sideshow Bob began his career as the non-speaking sidekick on <a href="Krusty%20the%20Clown">Krusty the Clown</a>'s television show. The episode "<a href="Brother%20from%20Another%20Series">Brother from Another Series</a>" (<a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%208%29">season eight</a>, 1997) reveals that Bob only received the job after his younger brother <a href="List%20of%20recurring%20The%20Simpsons%20characters%23Cecil%20Terwilliger">Cecil</a> failed an audition, because Krusty considered Bob to be a perfect comic foil. After repeated instances of abuse, including being shot from a cannon and hit constantly with pies, the <a href="Yale%20University">Yale</a>-educated Bob became angry at Krusty and resentful of the clown's success. In "<a href="Krusty%20Gets%20Busted">Krusty Gets Busted</a>" (<a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%201%29">season one</a>, 1990) Bob disguised himself as Krusty and framed him for armed robbery of the <a href="Kwik-E-Mart">Kwik-E-Mart</a>. After Krusty is arrested, Bob takes control of the show, introducing children to elements of <a href="high%20culture">high culture</a>. However, Bob's reign is short-lived; <a href="Bart%20Simpson">Bart Simpson</a> exposes him as the robber, Krusty is released, and Bob is fired and sent to jail.

In "<a href="Black%20Widower">Black Widower</a>" (<a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%203%29">season three</a>, 1992), Bob's first major appearance after framing Krusty, he is released from prison and marries Bart's aunt <a href="Patty%20and%20Selma%20Bouvier">Selma Bouvier</a>. As part of a scheme to inherit money she has invested in the stock market, Bob attempts to blow Selma up during their honeymoon. Bart again foils the plan and Sideshow Bob returns to prison. After being paroled from prison in "<a href="Cape%20Feare">Cape Feare</a>" (<a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%205%29">season five</a>, 1993), Bob targets Bart directly, threatening him repeatedly and forcing the Simpsons into hiding as part of the Witness Relocation Program. Bob follows them to their hideout, a houseboat on Terror Lake, and, after subduing the family, prepares to kill Bart. He allows a final request, however, and Bart asks to hear Bob sing the entire score of "<a href="H.M.S.%20Pinafore">H.M.S. Pinafore</a>". The delaying tactic leads to Bob's third arrest.

Bob is released from prison once again in "<a href="Sideshow%20Bob%20Roberts">Sideshow Bob Roberts</a>" (<a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%206%29">season six</a>, 1994), and runs for Mayor of <a href="Springfield%20%28The%20Simpsons%29">Springfield</a> as the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a> candidate. He defeats <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> incumbent <a href="Joe%20Quimby">Joe Quimby</a> in a landslide, but Bart and Lisa discover that Bob rigged the election, leading to another incarceration. Bob escapes from prison for the first time in "<a href="Sideshow%20Bob%27s%20Last%20Gleaming">Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming</a>" (<a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%207%29">season seven</a>, 1995), and threatens to blow up Springfield with a <a href="nuclear%20bomb">nuclear bomb</a> unless the city stops broadcasting all television shows. He is thwarted when he finds out that the bomb itself is a dud, then kidnaps Bart and flies the Wright Brothers' plane in an attempt to kill himself, Bart, and Krusty (who is hiding inside a shack, improvising a performance on the <a href="Emergency%20Broadcast%20System">Emergency Broadcast System</a>). This too is thwarted, and Bob returns to prison. In the following season, Bob takes advantage of the prison's work release program, and appears to be genuinely redeemed. In "<a href="Brother%20from%20Another%20Series">Brother from Another Series</a>", <a href="Timothy%20Lovejoy">Reverend Lovejoy</a> declares him a changed man and recommends him for a <a href="work%20release">work release</a> opportunity. Bob is discharged from prison into the care of his brother Cecil, who is <a href="Springfield%20%28The%20Simpsons%29">Springfield</a>'s chief hydrological and hydrodynamical engineer. However, the scheming Cecil, still smarting over his failed audition for Krusty, tries to frame Bob by sabotaging the Springfield Dam. Bob, Bart, and Lisa together stop Cecil and save the town, and both brothers, despite Bob's genuine innocence, are sent to prison.

In "<a href="Day%20of%20the%20Jackanapes">Day of the Jackanapes</a>" (<a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%2011%29">season 12</a>, 2001), Bob discovers that Krusty has erased all of the early shows featuring Sideshow Bob as Krusty himself is declaring his fifth and final retirement after being annoyed with the network executives. Bob is released from prison and develops a plot to kill Krusty using Bart as a suicide bomber during Krusty's retirement special. Just as Bob was to succeed, he overhears Krusty publicly holding himself responsible for turning Bob into a criminal, expressing his regret of mistreating Bob during his years as Sideshow. To appease things, Krusty sings himself a song on Bob's behalf, and being touched by this, Bob decides to abort his plan of attempted murder and reconciles with Krusty, although he is returned to prison for it. Bob's aid is sought by Springfield police in "<a href="The%20Great%20Louse%20Detective">The Great Louse Detective</a>" (<a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%2014%29">season 14</a>, 2002). After an attempt is made on <a href="Homer%20Simpson">Homer Simpson</a>'s life, Bob is released from prison to help find the culprit. When the mystery is solved, he returns to murder Bart. However, Bob finds he is "accustomed to [Bart's] face" and cannot do it.

It is revealed in "<a href="The%20Italian%20Bob">The Italian Bob</a>" (<a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%2017%29">season 17</a>, 2005) that Bob has moved to Italy to make a fresh start. He is elected mayor of a village in <a href="Tuscany">Tuscany</a> and marries a local woman named <a href="List%20of%20recurring%20The%20Simpsons%20characters%23Francesca%20Terwilliger">Francesca</a>, with whom he has a son named Gino. The Simpson family, in Italy to retrieve a car for <a href="Montgomery%20Burns">Mr. Burns</a>, encounters him by chance. Bob welcomes them with hospitality on the condition that they not reveal his felonious past; however, a drunken Lisa jokes about Bob's criminal deeds, alienating Bob from his citizens. He, his wife and son swear a <a href="Feud">vendetta</a> on the Simpsons. The entire Terwilliger family returns in "<a href="Funeral%20for%20a%20Fiend">Funeral for a Fiend</a>" (<a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%2019%29">season 19</a>, 2007) in which Bob's father, Robert Terwilliger Sr., and mother, Dame Judith Underdunk, make their first appearances. Bob fakes his own death and locks Bart in the coffin, which he attempts to cremate at the otherwise empty funeral home as all the Terwilligers laugh maniacally. They are foiled by Lisa and the rest of the Simpson family and sent to prison. Bob briefly returns in the <a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%2020%29">season 20</a> episode "<a href="Wedding%20for%20Disaster">Wedding for Disaster</a>", when Bart and Lisa initially suspect Bob of kidnapping Homer to prevent him from attending his second wedding with <a href="Marge%20Simpson">Marge</a> (due to a keychain they found had an 'S' and a 'B'), but Krusty provides him with an alibi, explaining to the kids that Bob was with him the whole day. Eventually, Bob and the kids discover the true culprits, <a href="Patty%20and%20Selma">Patty and Selma</a>.

Bob reappears again in the episode "<a href="The%20Bob%20Next%20Door">The Bob Next Door</a>" (<a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%2021%29">season 21</a>, 2010), where he switches faces with his prison cellmate Walt Warren. Bob returns to Springfield and moves into the house next to the Simpson family, assuming Walt's identity. He exploits this to make his latest attempt to kill Bart legally over state lines, but is foiled again and gets taken away by state police. Bob briefly appears in "<a href="At%20Long%20Last%20Leave">At Long Last Leave</a>" (<a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%2023%29">season 23</a>, 2012), where he attends a town meeting to decide if the Simpson family should be banished from Springfield, and is one of many who express their desire for it to happen. In "<a href="The%20Man%20Who%20Grew%20Too%20Much">The Man Who Grew Too Much</a>" (<a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%2025%29">season 25</a>, 2014), he was revealed as a Chief Scientist for a genetic engineering company named <a href="Monsanto">Monsarno</a>, having received the position after he was selected as a test subject and published the results of the experiments to which he was subjected. He and Lisa bond over their interest in <a href="Walt%20Whitman">Walt Whitman</a>, but Bob soon reveals that he has also genetically modified himself to give himself various superhuman abilities, intending to acquire DNA from the relics of various historical figures stored in the Springfield Museum to make himself a superhuman dictator. However, after he is provoked into a fight, he realizes that he has become a crude monster and jumps off the Springfield Dam, surviving because the gills he gave himself allow him to survive in the lake.

Bob briefly appears in "<a href="Clown%20in%20the%20Dumps">Clown in the Dumps</a>" (<a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%2026%29">season 26</a>, 2014), where offered his condolences to Krusty after the death of his father, <a href="Rabbi%20Krustofsky">Rabbi Krustofsky</a>. He also made a brief appearance on "<a href="Blazed%20and%20Confused">Blazed and Confused</a>" (<a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%2026%29">season 26</a>, 2014), where he meets Mr. Lassen, Bart's former teacher, who was now reduced to working in prison as a guard after Bart's actions got him fired. Despite Lassen's offer to get him out, Bob rejects the idea that they team up as Lassen thought that they would take turns gutting Bart. In "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20XXVI">Treehouse of Horror XXVI</a>" segment "Wanted: Dead, then Alive", Bob successfully kills Bart, but finds his life so meaningless in Bart's absence that he creates a machine to bring Bart back to life so that he can keep killing his enemy over and over, until the other Simpsons rescue Bart and Bart uses the resurrection machine to turn Bob into a twisted amalgamation of creatures. Bob has made a brief appearance in "<a href="Gal%20of%20Constant%20Sorrow">Gal of Constant Sorrow</a>", grunting in annoyance as he wipes off Bart's graffiti from Hettie Mae Boggs' promo poster on the wall along with Snake Jailbird and other inmates. Bob appeared in the 29th season in "<a href="Gone%20Boy">Gone Boy</a>" when he tries to track down the whereabouts of <a href="Bart%20Simpson">Bart Simpson</a>.

In addition to regular roles in the television series, Sideshow Bob has made several appearances in other "Simpsons" media. Kelsey Grammer recorded several Sideshow Bob lines for "<a href="The%20Simpsons%20Movie">The Simpsons Movie</a>," but the scene was cut. Sideshow Bob has made regular appearances in the monthly <a href="List%20of%20The%20Simpsons%20comics%23Simpsons%20Comics">"Simpsons Comics"</a>, and several of Kelsey Grammer's singing performances have been included in "The Simpsons" CD compilations. His performance of the "H.M.S. Pinafore" in "Cape Feare" was later included on the album "<a href="Go%20Simpsonic%20with%20The%20Simpsons">Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons</a>," and the song "<a href="I%27ve%20Grown%20Accustomed%20to%20Her%20Face">The Very Reason That I Live</a>" from "The Great Louse Detective" was included on "". A previously unaired song, "Hullaba Lula", originally written for "Day of the Jackanapes", was also included on that compilation. The producers modeled the song after "<a href="Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah">Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah</a>", but were forced to remove the song from the episode when they were unable to obtain the rights to it.

In "<a href="The%20Simpsons%20Game">The Simpsons Game</a>", released in November 2007, Bob has a speaking cameo appearance at the end of the chapter titled "Invasion of the Yokel-Snatchers" in which he was working with <a href="Kang%20and%20Kodos">Kang and Kodos</a>. Sideshow Bob appears in the 1991 "<a href="The%20Simpsons%20Arcade%20Game">The Simpsons Arcade Game</a>", on the fifth level where he is pulling a cart containing a roast chicken health pick up. Bob was also included as a level boss in the 1991 video game "". Sideshow Bob plays a lead role in <a href="The%20Simpsons%20Ride">The Simpsons Ride</a>, which opened at <a href="Universal%20Studios%20Florida">Universal Studios Florida</a> and <a href="Universal%20Studios%20Hollywood">Universal Studios Hollywood</a> in May 2008. Voiced by Grammer, he is the main villain in the ride, having escaped from prison to get revenge on the Simpson family.

In "", a city builder game released in February 2012, Sideshow Bob occurs as a bonus. Popping up every couple hours, the players are given a chance to tap on him to receive a small sum of money, and "send" him to jail. In a later update to the game, Sideshow Bob also has a stand in Krusty Land, where player get to pop balloons for a chance to win donuts and Krusty <a href="Ticket%20%28admission%29">tickets</a>. The Simpsons: Tapped Out Terwilligers content update was released April 14, 2015 and has several references to the Simpsons episodes with Sideshow Bob. This game event was split in 3 acts and ended June 4, 2015. New characters, skins and costumes include Sideshow Bob, Cecil Terwilliger, Gino Terwilliger, Francesca Terwilliger, Dr. Robert Terwilliger Sr., Judith Underdunk, Captain Bob and Opera Krusty. Most of the event action takes place at Monsarno Research and Opera House.

Sideshow Bob first appeared in "<a href="The%20Telltale%20Head">The Telltale Head</a>", the eighth episode of <a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%201%29">season one</a>. His design was relatively simple compared to later incarnations, and his hairstyle was rounded. However, towards the end of the episode, he appears again, in a panning shot of a crowd, with his familiar hairstyle. His first major appearance was in season one's twelfth episode "<a href="Krusty%20Gets%20Busted">Krusty Gets Busted</a>", written by <a href="Jay%20Kogen">Jay Kogen</a> and <a href="Wallace%20Wolodarsky">Wallace Wolodarsky</a>. Bob's design was updated for "Krusty Gets Busted"; as the episode's animation style evolved, director <a href="Brad%20Bird">Brad Bird</a> made the character of Sideshow Bob sleeker and more refined, to fit Grammer's voice technique. Following the re-design, animators tried to redraw his scenes in "The Telltale Head", but had insufficient time before the show was produced.

Bob has no lines of dialogue during the first half of "Krusty Gets Busted"; the character's only communication takes the form of a <a href="slide%20whistle">slide whistle</a>. This was designed to make Bob appear simplistic, so that when he finally spoke, viewers would be surprised to hear his sophisticated vocabulary. An early version of the script for "Krusty Gets Busted" called for <a href="James%20Earl%20Jones">James Earl Jones</a> to voice Bob, but the producers instead selected <a href="Kelsey%20Grammer">Kelsey Grammer</a>. For Bob's voice, Grammer performed an impression of theatre actor and director <a href="Ellis%20Rabb">Ellis Rabb</a>. Grammer had once worked for Rabb, whose "lamenting tones became [the] foundation for Sideshow Bob".

Sideshow Bob's full name is Robert Underdunk Terwilliger. His last name was first revealed in "Black Widower" while his middle name was first mentioned in "Sideshow Bob Roberts". Competing theories as to the origin of his name exist; some sources say he was named after the character Dr. Terwilliker, a megalomaniac outwitted by a boy named Bart in the film "<a href="The%205%2C000%20Fingers%20of%20Dr.%20T">The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T</a>" by <a href="Dr.%20Seuss">Dr. Seuss</a>, but others say he was named after <a href="Terwilliger%20Boulevard">Terwilliger Boulevard</a> in <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>. Yet another theory is that he was named after Sergeant Terwilliger and Mrs. Underdunk in the pilot episode of the TV show "<a href="Hunter%20%281984%20U.S.%20TV%20series%29">Hunter</a>".

For <a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%203%29">season three</a>'s "<a href="Black%20Widower">Black Widower</a>", the writers echoed the premise of <a href="Wile%20E.%20Coyote%20and%20Road%20Runner">Wile E. Coyote chasing the Road Runner</a> from <a href="Looney%20Tunes">Looney Tunes</a> cartoons by having Bob unexpectedly insert himself into Bart's life and attempt to kill him. Executive producer <a href="Al%20Jean">Al Jean</a> has compared Bob's character to that of Wile E. Coyote, noting that both are intelligent, yet always foiled by what they perceive as an inferior intellect. For "Black Widower", director <a href="David%20Silverman%20%28animator%29">David Silverman</a> updated the character model to reflect the animation of director Brad Bird. A rule for earlier episodes featuring Bob called for a recap of his evil deeds; this was dropped after <a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%208%29">season eight</a>'s "<a href="Brother%20from%20Another%20Series">Brother from Another Series</a>" when the chronology became too lengthy. Another rule established by the show's writers mandated Bob's return to prison at the end of each episode, although this pattern was abandoned in later episodes like "The Great Louse Detective" and "The Italian Bob".

<a href="Bill%20Oakley">Bill Oakley</a> and <a href="Josh%20Weinstein">Josh Weinstein</a>, the <a href="showrunner">showrunner</a>s for the seventh and eighth seasons, believed that every season of the show should contain an episode starring Sideshow Bob. However, by the seventh season Bob had already been the focus of four stories, and writers were having trouble developing new ways to include him. Weinstein describes Bob's dialogue as difficult to write, due to his unique and refined style of speaking. Despite these challenges, however, creators of "The Simpsons" usually look forward to "Sideshow Bob episodes"; the writers consider them enjoyable to write, and former director <a href="Dominic%20Polcino">Dominic Polcino</a> describes them as "a treat" to work on.

Kelsey Grammer initially expected Sideshow Bob to be a one-time role, and calls him "the most popular character I've ever played". Grammer usually joins the show's "table readings" (wherein cast members read each script together for the first time), and former executive producer <a href="David%20Mirkin">David Mirkin</a> described working with Grammer as very pleasant, due to his lively sense of humor. Grammer, Mirkin says, is capable of perfect readings, but noted that the actor dislikes performing Sideshow Bob's evil laugh. In a 2007 interview, "Simpsons" executive producer <a href="Al%20Jean">Al Jean</a> listed Grammer as one of his favorite guest stars (second only to <a href="Phil%20Hartman">Phil Hartman</a>), saying "his voice is so rich." Writer <a href="George%20Meyer">George Meyer</a> commented that "writing for Kelsey is great, he can give the kind of purple, florid, melodramatic speeches that most of the characters would never give. And he can sing."

The show's writers admire Grammer's singing voice, and try to include a song for each appearance. <a href="Alf%20Clausen">Alf Clausen</a>, the primary composer for "The Simpsons", commented that "[Grammer] is so great. He's just amazing. You can tell he has this love of musical theater and he has the vocal instrument to go with it, so I know whatever I write is going to be sung the way I've heard it." Clausen composed Sideshow Bob's theme, which is played whenever Bob gets out of prison or is about to commit a sinister action, and was first used in "<a href="Cape%20Feare">Cape Feare</a>". It is based on the score of the film "<a href="Cape%20Fear%20%281962%20film%29">Cape Fear</a>", composed by <a href="Bernard%20Herrmann">Bernard Herrmann</a>. The musical score for "Cape Feare" earned Clausen an <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a> nomination for <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Music%20Composition%20for%20a%20Series">Outstanding Dramatic Underscore – Series</a> in 1994.

Bob's prisoner number is often 24601, which is <a href="Jean%20Valjean">Jean Valjean</a>'s prisoner number in "<a href="Les%20Mis%C3%A9rables">Les Misérables</a>". Another trademark for Bob is a visual gag of stepping on a rake and being struck in the face with its handle; this joke first appeared in "Cape Feare". To fill time, the writers added nine consecutive iterations of the same joke in quick succession. The sequence has become known as the "rake joke" and was described by "Entertainment Weekly" as showing "genius in its repetitive stupidity."

The episode "<a href="Brother%20from%20Another%20Series">Brother from Another Series</a>" introduces Bob's brother Cecil. After writer <a href="Ken%20Keeler">Ken Keeler</a> was assigned to write an episode featuring Sideshow Bob, he drew inspiration from episodes of "<a href="Frasier">Frasier</a>". He decided to incorporate elements of Grammer's other show into the character of Sideshow Bob, and designed Cecil to resemble Grammer's brother on "Frasier". Cecil is voiced by <a href="David%20Hyde%20Pierce">David Hyde Pierce</a>, who portrayed <a href="Frasier%20Crane">Frasier Crane</a>'s brother <a href="Niles%20Crane">Niles</a>. Pierce commented, "Normally, I would not do something like this. But how often do you get a chance to work with an actor like Kelsey Grammer and, more importantly, play his brother?" Several of "Frasier" producers were asked to review the original script and provide feedback. Their comments were positive; they only expressed concern with a very brief scene in which Cecil talks to a visible character whom he refers to as "Maris". In "Frasier", <a href="Maris%20Crane">Maris Crane</a> is an <a href="unseen%20character">unseen character</a>, and the producers of "Frasier" asked that the scene be removed. Many of the interactions between Bob and Cecil were based on those of Niles and Frasier. Cecil was drawn to resemble <a href="David%20Hyde%20Pierce">David Hyde Pierce</a>, while retaining a visual similarity to Sideshow Bob. According to director <a href="Pete%20Michels">Pete Michels</a>, it was difficult to draw Bob and Cecil standing together, because of their comically oversized feet.

Cecil returns in <a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%2019%29">season 19</a>'s "<a href="Funeral%20for%20a%20Fiend">Funeral for a Fiend</a>", which introduces the brothers' previously unseen father, Dr. Robert Terwilliger, played by <a href="John%20Mahoney">John Mahoney</a>. Mahoney portrayed <a href="Martin%20Crane">Martin Crane</a>, the father of Grammer's and Pierce's characters in "Frasier". Whereas in "Frasier", Mahoney played the "down-to-Earth, average guy" to Grammer's and Hyde Pierce's "uppity snobs", Robert Terwilliger Sr. was portrayed as equally highbrow as Bob. His wife, Bob's mother, is Dame Judith Underdunk, "the finest classical actress of her generation." She sports the same curly spiked hair as her two sons. Bob also has a wife named Francesca (voiced by <a href="Maria%20Grazia%20Cucinotta">Maria Grazia Cucinotta</a>) and a son named Gino, both of whom were introduced in <a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%2017%29">season 17</a> episode "<a href="The%20Italian%20Bob">The Italian Bob</a>" and returned for "<a href="Funeral%20for%20a%20Fiend">Funeral for a Fiend</a>".

The character of Sideshow Bob and Grammer's voicework have received many accolades. In 2006 <a href="IGN">IGN</a> listed him as the second-best "peripheral character" on "The Simpsons", commenting that Bob is "a man of contradictions; his goofy appearance, complete with palm tree like hair, doesn't seem to match up to the well spoken and even musically talented maniac." Also that year, "<a href="Wizard%20%28magazine%29">Wizard Magazine</a>" rated Bob as the 66th greatest villain of all time. Adam Finley of <a href="TV%20Squad">TV Squad</a> wrote that "that baritone voice, the Shakespearean delivery, and the ability to go from calm and collected to stark raving mad all within the same second make Sideshow Bob one of the best recurring characters on the show."

Kelsey Grammer has consistently received praise for his voicework, and has been described as "brilliant", "inimitable" and "a feast of mid-Atlantic anglophilia". In 2006, Grammer won the <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award">Primetime Emmy Award</a> for <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Voice-Over%20Performance">Outstanding Voice-Over Performance</a> for his role in "<a href="The%20Italian%20Bob">The Italian Bob</a>"; he had previously won four awards in the <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Lead%20Actor%20-%20Comedy%20Series">Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series</a> category for his portrayal of the title role on "Frasier". In 2008, Grammer was included in "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>"s list of the sixteen best "Simpsons" guest stars; Hyde Pierce was also included in that list. Ken Tucker of "Entertainment Weekly" wrote that "Kelsey Grammer's grand voice-performance as Sideshow Bob is Frasier pickled in arsenic." In her book "<a href="My%20Life%20as%20a%2010-Year-Old%20Boy">My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy</a>", <a href="Nancy%20Cartwright">Nancy Cartwright</a> (who performs the voice of Bart Simpson) wrote that "Kelsey Grammer scores big-time by injecting caustic, bitter, contemptuous and deliciously vile energy into his rendition of Sideshow Bob. Springfield just wouldn't be the same without him."

Most of the episodes featuring Bob have been well received by fans and critics. "<a href="Cape%20Feare">Cape Feare</a>" is generally regarded as one of the best episodes of "The Simpsons" and placed third on "Entertainment Weekly"s 2003 list of the show's top 25 episodes. IGN considers it the best episode of the fifth season. In 2007, "<a href="Vanity%20Fair%20%28magazine%29">Vanity Fair</a>" called it the show's fourth-best episode, because of its "masterful integration of filmic parody and a recurring character". <a href="Ben%20Rayner">Ben Rayner</a> of the "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a>" listed "Cape Feare", "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming" and "Brother From Another Series" among the best episodes of the series, writing "forget "Frasier", these are Kelsey Grammer's best roles." "<a href="The%20Italian%20Bob">The Italian Bob</a>" and its writer <a href="John%20Frink">John Frink</a> won a <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20Award">Writers Guild of America Award</a> in 2007 in the animation category. In December 2009, Robert Canning of IGN ranked the ten episodes to feature Bob that had aired at the time. The first five Bob episodes took up the top five, with "Cape Feare" being ranked first. "The Italian Bob" was ranked tenth, with the explanation that "All the things we love about a Sideshow Bob episode – the vengeance, the familiar settings and characters, the elaborate scheming – were missing from this half-hour. Without it, Bob wasn't nearly as entertaining, and the episode didn't result in a whole lot of laughs." He noted that only "The Italian Bob" and the ninth ranked "Funeral for a Fiend" were "the only ones I'd consider clunkers. The remaining episodes are all quite fun."

In "<a href="Planet%20Simpson">Planet Simpson</a>", author <a href="Chris%20Turner%20%28author%29">Chris Turner</a> writes that Bob is built into a highbrow snob and conservative <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> so that the writers can continually use him as a strawman and pincushion. He represents <a href="high%20culture">high culture</a> while Krusty represents <a href="low%20culture">low culture</a>, and Bart, stuck in between, always wins out. In the book "<a href="Leaving%20Springfield">Leaving Springfield</a>", David L. G. Arnold comments that Bart is a product of a "mass-culture upbringing" and thus is Bob's enemy. Frustrated by his early role as the target of "Krusty's cheap gags", Bob frames Krusty and takes over the show. He changes the content of that show to present readings of classic literature and segments examining the emotional lives of pre-teens. He believes that by exposing the kids to high culture he will improve their lives. Arnold writes that "Bob's own conscience and morality are clearly unaffected by the high culture he represents." He also tries to "manipulate the tastes of the masses" by becoming a criminal mastermind. Arnold believes that this is most apparent in "<a href="Sideshow%20Bob%20Roberts">Sideshow Bob Roberts</a>", wherein he rigs the election to become the mayor of Springfield. When accused of election fraud, he rants, "Your guilty consciences may force you to vote Democratic, but secretly you yearn for a cold-hearted Republican who'll cut taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king! You need me, Springfield!" He considers himself a member of the social elite, and happily uses <a href="Niccol%C3%B2%20Machiavelli">Machiavellian</a> methods to acquire and maintain power.

Bob's intelligence serves him in many ways. During the episode "Cape Feare", for example, the parole board asks Bob why he has a tattoo that says "Die, Bart, Die". Bob replies that it is German for "The, Bart, The"; members of the board are impressed by his reasoning. Believing that "nobody who speaks German could be an evil man", they release him. However, his love of high culture is sometimes used against him. In the same episode, Bob agrees to perform the operetta "<a href="H.M.S.%20Pinafore">H.M.S. Pinafore</a>" in its entirety as a last request for Bart. The tactic stalls Bob long enough for the police to arrest him.

Japanese aircraft carrier Hiryū

After a brief refit, "Hiryū" and three other fleet carriers of the <a href="First%20Air%20Fleet">First Air Fleet</a> ("Kido Butai") participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a> in June 1942. After bombarding American forces on <a href="Midway%20Atoll">the atoll</a>, the carriers were attacked by aircraft from Midway and the carriers , , and . <a href="Dive%20bomber">Dive bomber</a>s from "Yorktown" and "Enterprise" crippled "Hiryū" and set her afire. She was <a href="scuttling">scuttled</a> the following day after it became clear that she could not be salvaged. The loss of "Hiryū" and three other IJN carriers at Midway was a crucial strategic defeat for Japan and contributed significantly to the Allies' ultimate victory in the Pacific.

"Hiryū" was one of two large carriers approved for construction under the <a href="2nd%20Naval%20Armaments%20Supplement%20Programme">1931–32 Supplementary Program</a>. Originally designed as the <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a> of "Sōryū", her design was enlarged and modified in light of the <a href="Tomozuru%20Incident">"Tomozuru"</a> and <a href="4th%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29%23The%20Fourth%20Fleet%20Incident">Fourth Fleet Incidents</a> in 1934–35 that revealed many IJN ships were top-heavy, <a href="Stability%20conditions">unstable</a> and structurally weak. Her <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a> was raised and her <a href="hull%20%28watercraft%29">hull</a> strengthened. Other changes involved increasing her <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a>, <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displacement</a>, and armor protection.

The ship had a length of <a href="length%20overall">overall</a>, a beam of and a <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draft</a> of . She displaced at <a href="Displacement%20%28ship%29%23Standard%20displacement">standard</a> load and at normal load. Her crew consisted of 1,100 officers and enlisted men.

"Hiryū" was fitted with four geared <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a> sets with a total of , each driving one <a href="propeller%20shaft%20%28ship%29">propeller shaft</a>, using steam provided by eight Kampon <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s. The turbines and boilers were the same as those used in the s. The ship's power and slim, cruiser-type hull with a length-to-beam ratio of 10:1 gave her a speed of and made her the fastest carrier in the world at the time of her commissioning. "Hiryū" carried of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> which gave her a range of at . The boiler uptakes were trunked to the ship's starboard side amidships and exhausted just below <a href="flight%20deck">flight deck</a> level through two <a href="funnel%20%28ship%29">funnel</a>s curved downward.

The carrier's flight deck was wide and overhung her <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a> at both ends, supported by pairs of pillars. "Hiryū" was one of only two carriers ever built whose <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23island">island</a> was on the port side of the ship ( was the other). It was also positioned further to the rear and encroached on the width of the flight deck, unlike "Sōryū". Nine transverse <a href="arrestor%20wire">arrestor wire</a>s were installed on the flight deck that could stop a aircraft. One group of three wires was positioned further forward to allow the ship to land aircraft over the bow, although this was never done in practice. The flight deck was only above the <a href="waterline">waterline</a> and the ship's designers kept this figure low by reducing the height of the hangars. The upper hangar was and had an approximate height of ; the lower was and had an approximate height of . Together they had an approximate total area of . This caused problems in handling aircraft because the wings of a <a href="Nakajima%20B5N">Nakajima B5N</a> "Kate" <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a> could neither be spread nor folded in the upper hangar.

Aircraft were transported between the hangars and the flight deck by three <a href="Elevator%23Aircraft%20elevators">elevators</a>, the forward one abreast the island on the centerline and the other two offset to starboard. The forward platform measured , the middle one , and the rear . They were capable of transferring aircraft weighing up to . "Hiryū" had a designed aircraft capacity of 64, plus nine spares.

"Hiryū"s primary <a href="anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft</a> (AA) armament consisted of six twin-gun mounts equipped with 40-<a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">caliber</a> <a href="12.7%20cm/40%20Type%2089%20naval%20gun">12.7-centimeter Type 89</a> <a href="dual-purpose%20gun">dual-purpose gun</a>s mounted on projecting <a href="sponson">sponson</a>s, three on either side of the carrier's hull. When firing at surface targets, the guns had a range of ; they had a maximum ceiling of at their maximum elevation of +90 degrees. Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute, but their sustained rate of fire was approximately eight rounds per minute. The ship was equipped with two Type 94 <a href="Fire-control%20system%23Naval%20fire%20control">fire-control directors</a> to control the guns, one for each side of the ship; the starboard-side director was on top of the island and the other director was positioned below flight deck level on the port side.

The ship's light AA armament consisted of seven triple and five twin-gun mounts for <a href="license-built">license-built</a> <a href="25%20mm%20Hotchkiss%20anti-aircraft%20gun">Hotchkiss</a> <a href="Type%2096%2025%20mm%20AT/AA%20Gun">25 mm Type 96</a> AA guns. Two of the triple mounts were sited on a platform just below the forward end of the flight deck. The gun was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II, but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it largely ineffective. According to historian Mark Stille, the weapon had many faults including an inability to "handle high-speed targets because it could not be trained or elevated fast enough by either hand or power, its sights were inadequate for high-speed targets, it possessed excessive vibration and muzzle blast, and its magazines were too small to maintain high rates of fire". These guns had an effective range of , and an effective ceiling of at an elevation of +85 degrees. The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the fifteen-round <a href="magazine%20%28firearms%29">magazines</a>. The Type 96 guns were controlled by five Type 95 directors, two on each side and one in the bow.

"Hiryū" had a <a href="Belt%20armor">waterline belt</a> with a maximum thickness of over the <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a>s that reduced to over the machinery spaces and the <a href="avgas">avgas</a> storage tanks. It was backed by an internal anti-splinter <a href="bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkhead</a>. The ship's <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> was thick over the machinery spaces and thick over the magazines and avgas storage tanks.

Following the <a href="Japanese%20ship-naming%20conventions">Japanese ship-naming conventions</a> for aircraft carriers, "Hiryū" was named "Flying Dragon". The ship was <a href="Keel">laid down</a> at the <a href="Yokosuka%20Naval%20Arsenal">Yokosuka Naval Arsenal</a> on 8 July 1936, <a href="Ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 16 November 1937 and <a href="Ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> on 5 July 1939. She was assigned to the <a href="Second%20Carrier%20Division">Second Carrier Division</a> on 15 November. In September 1940, the ship's air group was transferred to <a href="Hainan%20Island">Hainan Island</a> to support the <a href="Japanese%20invasion%20of%20French%20Indochina">Japanese invasion of French Indochina</a>. In February 1941, "Hiryū" supported the blockade of Southern China. Two months later, the 2nd Carrier Division, commanded by <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Tamon%20Yamaguchi">Tamon Yamaguchi</a>, was assigned to the <a href="First%20Air%20Fleet">First Air Fleet</a>, or "Kido Butai", on 10 April. "Hiryū" returned to Japan on 7 August and began a short refit that was completed on 15 September. She became <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of the Second Division from 22 September to 26 October while "Sōryū" was refitting.

In November 1941, the IJN's Combined Fleet, commanded by <a href="Admiral">Admiral</a> <a href="Isoroku%20Yamamoto">Isoroku Yamamoto</a>, prepared to participate in Japan's initiation of a formal war with the United States by conducting a preemptive strike against the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>'s <a href="United%20States%20Pacific%20Fleet">Pacific Fleet</a> base at <a href="Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a>, Hawaii. On 22 November, "Hiryū", commanded by <a href="Captain%20%28naval%29">Captain</a> <a href="Tomeo%20Kaku">Tomeo Kaku</a>, and the rest of the "Kido Butai", under <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Chuichi%20Nagumo">Chuichi Nagumo</a> and including six fleet carriers from the First, Second, and Fifth Carrier Divisions, assembled in Hitokappu Bay at <a href="Etorofu%20Island">Etorofu Island</a>. The fleet departed Etorofu on 26 November and followed a course across the north-central Pacific to avoid commercial shipping lanes. Now the flagship of the Second Carrier Division, the ship embarked 21 <a href="Mitsubishi%20A6M%20Zero">Mitsubishi A6M Zero</a> fighters, 18 <a href="Aichi%20D3A">Aichi D3A</a> "Val" dive bombers, and 18 Nakajima B5N "Kate" torpedo bombers. From a position north of <a href="Oahu">Oahu</a>, "Hiryū" and the other five carriers launched two waves of aircraft on the morning of 7 December 1941 Hawaiian time.

In the first wave, 8 B5N torpedo bombers were supposed to attack the aircraft carriers that normally berthed on the northwest side of <a href="Ford%20Island">Ford Island</a>, but none were in Pearl Harbor that day; 4 of the B5N pilots diverted to their secondary target, ships berthed alongside "1010 Pier" where the fleet flagship was usually <a href="wikt%3Amoor">moored</a>. That ship, the battleship , was in <a href="drydock">drydock</a> and its position was occupied by the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> and the <a href="minelayer">minelayer</a> ; all four torpedoes missed. The other four pilots attacked the battleships and . The remaining 10 B5Ns were tasked to drop armor-piercing bombs on the battleships berthed on the southeast side of Ford Island ("Battleship Row") and may have scored one or two hits on them, in addition to causing a magazine explosion aboard the battleship that sank her with heavy loss of life. The 6 A6M Zeros <a href="strafe">strafe</a>d parked aircraft at <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Air%20Station%20Ewa">Marine Corps Air Station Ewa</a> (MCAS Ewa), claiming 22 aircraft destroyed.

The second wave consisted of 9 Zeros and 18 D3As, one of each aborting with mechanical problems. The former strafed <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Air%20Station%20Kaneohe%20Bay">Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay</a> before moving on to attack <a href="Bellows%20Army%20Airfield">Bellows Army Airfield</a>. They strafed the airfield, and shot down two <a href="Curtiss%20P-40">Curtiss P-40</a> fighters attempting to take off when the Zeros arrived and a <a href="Boeing%20B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress</a> <a href="heavy%20bomber">heavy bomber</a> that had earlier diverted from <a href="Hickam%20Army%20Airfield">Hickam Army Airfield</a>, and also destroyed a <a href="Stinson%20O-49">Stinson O-49</a> observation aircraft on the ground for the loss of one of their own. The fighters with remaining ammunition expended it strafing MCAS Ewa, the rendezvous point for the second-wave fighters. The D3As attacked various ships in Pearl Harbor, but it is not possible to identify which aircraft attacked which ship. Two D3As from "Hiryū" were lost during the attack, one shot down by <a href="Second%20Lieutenant">Second Lieutenant</a> <a href="George%20Welch%20%28pilot%29">George Welch</a>.

While returning to Japan after the attack, Vice Admiral <a href="Ch%C5%ABichi%20Nagumo">Chūichi Nagumo</a>, commander of the First Air Fleet, ordered that "Sōryū" and "Hiryū" be detached on 16 December to attack the defenders of <a href="Battle%20of%20Wake%20Island">Wake Island</a> who had already defeated the first Japanese attack on the island. The two carriers reached the vicinity of the island on 21 December and launched 29 D3As and 2 B5Ns, escorted by 18 Zeros, to attack ground targets. They encountered no aerial opposition and launched 35 B5Ns and 6 A6M Zeros the following day. They were intercepted by the 2 surviving <a href="Grumman%20F4F%20Wildcat">Grumman F4F Wildcat</a> fighters of <a href="United%20States%20Marine">Marine</a> Fighter Squadron <a href="VMF-211">VMF-211</a>. The Wildcats shot down 2 B5Ns before they were shot down by <a href="Petty%20officer%2C%20third%20class">PO3c</a> Isao Towara. The garrison surrendered the next day after Japanese troops were landed.

The carriers arrived at <a href="Kure%2C%20Hiroshima">Kure</a> on 29 December. They were assigned to the Southern Force on 8 January 1942 and departed four days later for the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>. The ships supported the invasion of the <a href="Palau%20Islands">Palau Islands</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ambon">Battle of Ambon</a>, attacking Allied positions on <a href="Ambon%20Island">the island</a> on 23 January with 54 aircraft. Four days later the carriers detached 18 Zeros and 9 D3As to operate from land bases in support of Japanese operations in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Borneo%20%281941%E2%80%9342%29">Battle of Borneo</a>. "Hiryū" and "Sōryū" arrived at Palau on 28 January and waited for the arrival of the carriers and "Akagi". All four carriers departed Palau on 15 February and launched <a href="Bombing%20of%20Darwin%20%28February%201942%29">air strikes</a> against <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin, Australia</a>, four days later. "Hiryū" contributed 18 B5Ns, 18 D3As, and 9 Zeros to the attack. Her aircraft attacked the ships in port and its facilities, sinking or setting on fire three ships and damaging two others. The Zeros destroyed 1 P-40E as it was taking off, 2 <a href="Consolidated%20PBY%20Catalina">Consolidated PBY Catalina</a> seaplanes on the water, and a Zero was forced to <a href="crash%20landing">crash land</a> after being damaged by a P-40E of the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> (USAAF) <a href="33rd%20Pursuit%20Squadron">33rd Pursuit Squadron</a>.

"Hiryū" and the other carriers arrived at <a href="Staring%20Bay">Staring Bay</a> on <a href="Celebes%20Island">Celebes Island</a> on 21 February to resupply and rest before departing four days later to support the <a href="Battle%20of%20Java%20%281942%29">invasion of Java</a>. On 1 March 1942, the ship's D3As damaged the destroyer badly enough for her to be caught and sunk by Japanese cruisers. Later that day the dive bombers sank the <a href="oil%20tanker">oil tanker</a> . The four carriers launched an airstrike of 180 aircraft against <a href="Cilacap%20Regency">Tjilatjep</a> on 5 March and set the town on fire, sinking five small ships, and damaging nine others that later had to be <a href="scuttled">scuttled</a>. Two days later, they attacked <a href="Christmas%20Island">Christmas Island</a> and "Hiryū"s aircraft sank the Dutch freighter "Poelau Bras" before returning to Staring Bay on 11 March to resupply and train for the impending <a href="Indian%20Ocean%20raid">Indian Ocean raid</a>. This raid was intended to secure newly conquered Burma, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies against any Allied attack by destroying base facilities and forces in the eastern Indian Ocean.

On 26 March, the five carriers of the First Air Fleet departed from Staring Bay; they were spotted by a Catalina about southeast of <a href="Ceylon">Ceylon</a> on the morning of 4 April. Six of "Hiryū"s Zeros were on <a href="Combat%20Air%20Patrol">Combat Air Patrol</a> (CAP) and helped to shoot it down. Nagumo closed to within of <a href="Colombo">Colombo</a> before launching an airstrike the next morning. "Hiryū" contributed 18 B5Ns and 9 Zeros to the force; the latter encountered a flight of 6 <a href="Fairey%20Swordfish">Fairey Swordfish</a> torpedo bombers from <a href="788%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">788 Naval Air Squadron</a> en route and shot them all down without loss. The Japanese aircraft encountered defending <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a> fighters from <a href="No.%2030%20Squadron%20RAF">Nos. 30</a> and <a href="No.%20258%20Squadron%20RAF">258 Squadrons RAF</a> over <a href="Ratmalana%20International%20Airport">Ratmalana</a> airfield and "Hiryū"s fighters claimed to have shot down 11 with 3 Zeros damaged, although the fighters from the other carriers also made claims. British losses were 21 Hurricanes shot down and 2 more forced to crash land. The D3As and B5Ns inflicted some damage to the port facilities, but a day's warning had allowed much of the shipping in the harbor to be evacuated. The British were attempting to find Nagumo's ships all morning and "Hiryū"s Zeros on CAP over the fleet helped to shoot down an <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">RAF</a> Catalina, shot down a <a href="Fairey%20Albacore">Fairey Albacore</a> torpedo bomber and drove off another from the carrier . Later that morning the British <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a>s and were spotted and "Hiryū" launched 18 D3As. They sank both ships in combination with the dive bombers from the other carriers.

On the morning of 9 April, "Hiryū"s CAP shot down another Catalina attempting to locate the fleet and, later that morning, contributed 18 B5Ns, escorted by 6 Zeros, to the <a href="Easter%20Sunday%20Raid%23The%20attack%20on%20Trincomalee%20Harbour">attack on Trincomalee</a>. The fighters engaged <a href="No.%20261%20Squadron%20RAF">261 Squadron RAF</a>, claiming to have shot down two with two more shared with fighters from the other carriers. British losses were only eight fighters, but the Japanese pilots claimed a total of 49 aircraft shot down when the RAF only had 16 Hurricanes in the fight. The British pilots shot down one of "Hiryū"s B5Ns and forced another to crash land while they were bombing the port. Meanwhile, a <a href="floatplane">floatplane</a> from the battleship spotted the small aircraft carrier , escorted by the destroyer , and every available D3A was launched to attack the ships, escorted by nine Zeros. "Hiryū" contributed 18 dive bombers and 3 fighters, but they arrived too late to assist in sinking them and found two other ships further north. They sank the freighter RFA "Athelstone" and her escorting <a href="corvette">corvette</a>, . While this was going on, "Akagi" narrowly escaped damage when 9 British <a href="Bristol%20Blenheim">Bristol Blenheim</a> bombers from Ceylon penetrated the CAP and dropped their bombs from . "Hiryū" had eight Zeros aloft, along with 12 more from the other carriers, and collectively they accounted for 5 of the British bombers for the loss of 1 of "Hiryū"s Zeros. The Blenheims ran into the D3As from , escorted by "Hiryū"s Zeros, on their way back home and lost one more bomber to the Japanese aircraft. The dive bombers claimed to have shot down two Blenheims in conjunction with the Zeros, which claimed one on their own, for the loss of one Zero shot down by the bombers' gunners and one D3A damaged. After launching the dive bombers that sank "Hermes" and the other ships, the First Air Fleet reversed course and headed southeast for the <a href="Malacca%20Strait">Malacca Strait</a> and Japan.

On 19 April, while transiting the <a href="Bashi%20Straits">Bashi Straits</a> between Taiwan and <a href="Luzon">Luzon</a> en route to Japan, "Hiryū", "Sōryū", and "Akagi" were sent in pursuit of the American carriers and , which had launched the <a href="Doolittle%20Raid">Doolittle Raid</a> against Tokyo. They found only empty ocean, as the American carriers had immediately departed the area to return to Hawaii. The carriers quickly abandoned the chase and dropped anchor at <a href="Hashirajima">Hashirajima</a> anchorage on 22 April. Having been engaged in constant operations for four and a half months, the ship, along with the other three carriers of the First and Second Carrier Divisions, was hurriedly refitted and replenished in preparation for the <a href="Combined%20Fleet">Combined Fleet</a>'s next major operation, scheduled to begin one month hence. While at Hashirajima, "Hiryū"s air group was based ashore at Tomitaka Airfield, near <a href="Saiki%2C%20%C5%8Cita">Saiki, Ōita</a>, and conducted flight and weapons training with the other First Air Fleet carrier units.

Concerned by the US carrier strikes in the Marshall Islands, <a href="Invasion%20of%20Lae-Salamaua">Lae-Salamaua</a>, and the Doolittle raids, Yamamoto was determined to force the US Navy into a showdown to eliminate the American carrier threat. He decided to invade and occupy <a href="Midway%20Atoll">Midway Atoll</a>, which he was sure would draw out the American carriers to defend it. The Japanese codenamed the Midway invasion Operation "MI". Unknown to the Japanese, the US Navy had divined the Japanese plan by breaking its <a href="JN-25">JN-25</a> code and had prepared an ambush using its three available carriers, positioned northeast of Midway.

On 25 May 1942, "Hiryū" set out with the Combined Fleet's carrier striking force in the company of "Kaga", "Akagi", and "Sōryū", which constituted the First and Second Carrier Divisions, for the attack on Midway. Her aircraft complement consisted of 18 Zeros, 18 D3As, and 18 B5Ns. Also aboard were 3 A6Ms of the 6th <a href="K%C5%8Dk%C5%ABtai">Kōkūtai</a> intended as the aerial garrison for Midway. With the fleet positioned northwest of Midway at dawn (04:45 local time) on 4 June 1942, "Hiryū"s portion of the 108-plane airstrike was an attack on the facilities on Sand Island with 18 torpedo bombers, 1 of which aborted with mechanical problems, escorted by nine Zeros. The air group suffered heavily during the attack: 2 B5Ns were shot down en route to the island, another was shot down by AA fire, 1 was forced to <a href="Water%20landing">ditch</a> on the trip back, another disappeared on the return trip and 5 were damaged beyond repair.

The carrier also contributed 3 Zeros to the total of 11 assigned to the initial CAP over the four carriers. By 07:05, the carrier had 6 fighters with the CAP which helped to defend the "Kido Butai" from the first US attackers from Midway Island at 07:10. At this time, Nagumo's carriers were attacked by 6 US Navy <a href="Grumman%20TBF%20Avenger">Grumman TBF Avenger</a>s from <a href="VT-8">Torpedo Squadron 8 (VT-8)</a> and 4 USAAC <a href="Martin%20B-26%20Marauder">Martin B-26 Marauder</a>s, all carrying torpedoes. The Avengers went after "Hiryū" while the Marauders attacked "Akagi". The 30 CAP Zeros in the air at this time, including the 6 from "Hiryū", immediately attacked the American airplanes, shooting down 5 of the Avengers and 2 of the B-26s. The Avengers shot down 1 of "Hiryū"s Zeros. The surviving aircraft dropped their torpedoes, but all missed.

At 07:15, Nagumo ordered the B5Ns on "Kaga" and "Akagi" rearmed with bombs for another attack on Midway itself. This process was slowed by the number of ordnance carts used to handle the bombs and torpedoes and the limited number of ordnance elevators. This meant that the torpedoes could not be struck below until after all the bombs were moved up from their magazine, assembled and mounted on the aircraft. This process normally took about an hour and a half; more time would be required to bring the aircraft up to the flight deck, and to warm up and launch the strike group. Around 07:40, he reversed his order when he received a message from one of his scout aircraft that American warships had been spotted. Depleted of ammunition, two of "Hiryū"s CAP Zeros landed aboard the carrier at 07:40.

At 07:55, the next American strike from Midway arrived in the form of 16 Marine <a href="Douglas%20SBD%20Dauntless">Douglas SBD Dauntless</a> dive bombers of Marine <a href="Scout%20Bomber%20Squadron%20%28VMSB-241%29">Scout Bomber Squadron (VMSB-241)</a> under Major <a href="Lofton%20R.%20Henderson">Lofton R. Henderson</a>. "Hiryū"s 3 CAP fighters were among the 9 still aloft that attacked Henderson's planes, shooting down 6 of them as they executed a fruitless glide bombing attack on "Hiryū". In return, the gunner of one the Dauntlesses shot down one of "Hiryū"s Zeros. At roughly the same time, the Japanese carriers were attacked by 12 USAAC B-17s, bombing from . The high altitude of the B-17s gave the Japanese captains enough time to anticipate where the bombs would land, and they successfully maneuvered out of the impact area. Four B-17s attacked "Hiryū", but missed with all their bombs.

"Hiryū" reinforced the CAP with launches of 3 more Zeros at 08:25. These fresh Zeros helped defeat the next American air strike from Midway, 11 <a href="Vought%20SB2U%20Vindicator">Vought SB2U Vindicator</a> dive bombers from VMSB-241, which attacked the battleship "Haruna" starting around 08:30. "Haruna" escaped damage and 3 of the Vindicators were shot down. Although all the American air strikes had thus far caused negligible damage, they kept the Japanese carrier forces off-balance as Nagumo endeavored to prepare a response to news, received at 08:20, of the sighting of American carrier forces to his northeast.

"Hiryū" began recovering her Midway strike force at around 09:00 and finished shortly by 09:10. The landed aircraft were quickly struck below, while the carriers' crews began preparations to spot aircraft for the strike against the American carrier forces. The preparations were interrupted at 09:18, when the first attacking American carrier aircraft were sighted. These consisted of 15 <a href="Douglas%20TBD%20Devastator">Douglas TBD Devastator</a> torpedo bombers of VT-8, led by <a href="Lieutenant%20Commander">Lieutenant Commander</a> <a href="John%20C.%20Waldron">John C. Waldron</a> from the "Hornet". They attempted a torpedo attack on "Soryū", but all of the American planes were shot down by the 18 CAP fighters, leaving one <a href="George%20H.%20Gay%2C%20Jr.">surviving aviator</a> treading water.

Shortly afterwards, 14 Devastators from <a href="Torpedo%20Squadron%206">Torpedo Squadron 6 (VT-6)</a> from "Enterprise", led by Lieutenant Commander <a href="Eugene%20E.%20Lindsey">Eugene E. Lindsey</a>, attacked. Lindsey's aircraft tried to sandwich "Kaga", but the CAP, reinforced by 4 additional Zeros launched by "Hiryū" at 09:37, shot down all but 4 of the Devastators, and "Kaga" dodged the torpedoes. "Hiryū" launched another trio of CAP Zeros at 10:13 after <a href="Torpedo%20Squadron%203%20%28VT-3%29">Torpedo Squadron 3 (VT-3)</a> from "Yorktown" was spotted. Two of her Zeros were shot down by Wildcats escorting VT-3 and another was forced to ditch.
While VT-3 was still attacking "Hiryū", American dive bombers arrived over the Japanese carriers almost undetected and began their dives. It was at this time, around 10:20, that in the words of Jonathan Parshall and Anthony Tully, the "Japanese air defenses would finally and catastrophically fail." Three American dive bomber squadrons now attacked the three other carriers and set each of them on fire. "Hiryū" was untouched and proceeded to launch 18 D3As, escorted by 6 Zeros, at 10:54 and a second wave of 10 B5Ns, escorted by 6 Zeros, at 13:30 against the American carrier . "En route", the Zeros engaged a group of "Enterprise"s Dauntlesses that they had spotted. They failed to shoot down any of the dive bombers, but two of the Zero were shot up by the bombers' rear gunners, with one Zero forced to ditch near a destroyer. American <a href="radar">radar</a> detected the incoming Japanese dive bombers at 11:52 and vectored "Yorktown"s CAP of 20 Wildcats against them. The Wildcats shot down three of the remaining Zeros for the loss of one of their own and engaged the D3As. Only seven of the dive bombers survived long enough to make their attack on "Yorktown" and two of those were shot down by flak during their dive, but they made three direct hits and two near misses that badly damaged the carrier and set her on fire.

The Americans had managed to extinguish her fires by 14:00 and "Yorktown" was making by 14:30 when the second group of Japanese aircraft launched from the "Hiryū" was approaching, low level torpedo bombers this time. They had been detected by the ship's radar at 13:55, but the CAP was held back until they got closer. Six Wildcats were on CAP duty and four were vectored toward the attacking aircraft while the other two were retained to cover the takeoff of the 10 Wildcats fueling on deck. The Japanese were jumped at 14:38 by two Wildcats which shot down one torpedo bomber before they were both shot down by the escorting Zeros. Two Zeros were shot down later for the loss of one Wildcat. Two more B5Ns were shot down before they could drop their torpedoes and three afterwards, but none of these aircraft hit the carrier. The last four torpedo bombers scored two hits (one B5N had its torpedo-release gear fail) on "Yorktown" that damaged three boilers and knocked out all electrical power so that she could not pump fuel oil to starboard to counteract her six degree <a href="list%20%28watercraft%29">list</a> to port. Seventeen minutes later, after the list increased to 23 degrees, the crew was ordered to abandon ship. Of the four Zeros and five B5Ns that returned to "Hiryū", only one Zero and three dive bombers were still flight-worthy.
Yamaguchi radioed his intention to Nagumo at 16:30 to launch a third strike against the American carriers at dusk (approximately 18:00), but Nagumo ordered the fleet to withdraw to the west. Unbeknownst to the Japanese, "Enterprise" and "Hornet" had already launched airstrikes well before then. "Enterprise" launched a total of 26 Dauntlesses at 15:25 using her own aircraft plus those from "Yorktown" that had been forced to recover aboard her after "Yorktown" was damaged, and "Hornet" launched 16 more of her own Dauntlesses at 16:00. At this point in the battle, "Hiryū" had only 4 air-worthy dive-bombers and 5 torpedo-planes left. She also retained 19 of her own fighters on board as well as a further 13 Zeros on CAP (a composite force of survivors from the other carriers). At 16:45, "Enterprise"s dive bombers spotted the Japanese carrier and began to maneuver for good attacking position while reducing altitude. At 16:56, just as the first Dauntlesses were beginning their dives, Nagumo ordered a change in course to 120 degrees, possibly to prepare to recover his reconnaissance floatplanes, that threw off the aim of the leading SBDs. The Japanese did not even spot the Americans until 17:01. The CAP shot down two of the American aircraft in their dives and another after it was forced to abort its dive when some of "Yorktown"s SBDs passed in front of it starting their own dives. "Hiryū" was struck by four bombs, three on the forward flight deck and one on the forward elevator. The explosions started fires among the aircraft on the hangar deck. The forward half of the flight deck collapsed into the hangar while part of the elevator was hurled against the ship's <a href="bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a>. The fires were severe enough that the remaining American aircraft attacked the other ships escorting "Hiryū", albeit without effect, deeming further attacks on the carrier as a waste of time because she was aflame from <a href="stem%20%28ship%29">stem</a> to stern. Beginning at 17:42, two groups of B-17s attempted to attack the Japanese ships without success, although one bomber strafed "Hiryū"s flight deck, killing several anti-aircraft gunners.

Although "Hiryū"s propulsion was not affected, the fires could not be brought under control. At 21:23, her engines stopped, and at 23:58 a major explosion rocked the ship. The order to abandon ship was given at 03:15, and the survivors were taken off by the destroyers and . Yamaguchi and Kaku decided to remain on board as "Hiryū" was torpedoed at 05:10 by "Makigumo" as the ship could not be salvaged. One torpedo missed and the other struck near the bow without the typical plume of water, although the detonation was quite visible. Around 07:00, one of 's <a href="Yokosuka%20B4Y">Yokosuka B4Y</a> aircraft discovered "Hiryū" still afloat and not in any visible danger of sinking. The aviators could also see crewmen aboard the carrier, men who had not received word to abandon ship. They finally launched some of the carrier's boats and abandoned ship themselves around 09:00. Thirty-nine men made it into the ship's <a href="cutter%20%28boat%29">cutter</a> only moments before "Hiryū" sank around 09:12, taking the bodies of 389 men with her. The cutter drifted for 14 days before being discovered by a Catalina and rescued by the seaplane tender . Four men died of their wounds or exposure before being picked up and a fifth died that night.

The loss of "Hiryū" and the three other IJN carriers at Midway, comprising two thirds of Japan's total number of fleet carriers and the experienced core of the First Air Fleet, was a strategic defeat for Japan and contributed significantly to Japan's ultimate defeat in the war. In an effort to conceal the defeat, the ship was not immediately removed from the Navy's registry of ships, instead being listed as "unmanned" before finally being struck from the registry on 25 September 1942.

The IJN selected a modified version of the "Hiryū" design for mass production to replace the carriers lost at the Battle of Midway. Of a planned program of 16 ships of the <a href="Unry%C5%AB-class%20aircraft%20carrier">"Unryū" class</a>, only six were laid down and three were commissioned before the end of the war.

Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga

The ship figured prominently in the development of the IJN's carrier striking force doctrine, which grouped carriers together to give greater mass and concentration to their air power. A revolutionary strategic concept at the time, the employment of the doctrine was crucial in enabling Japan to attain its initial strategic goals during the first six months of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a>.

"Kaga"s aircraft first supported Japanese troops in China during the <a href="28%20January%20Incident">Shanghai Incident</a> of 1932 and participated in the <a href="Second%20Sino-Japanese%20War">Second Sino-Japanese War</a> in the late 1930s. With other carriers, she took part in the <a href="battle%20of%20Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor raid</a> in December 1941 and the <a href="battle%20of%20Rabaul%20%281942%29">invasion of Rabaul</a> in the Southwest Pacific in January 1942. The following month her aircraft participated in a <a href="Bombing%20of%20Darwin">combined carrier airstrike</a> on <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>, Australia, helping secure the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies%20campaign">conquest</a> of the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> by Japanese forces. She missed the <a href="Indian%20Ocean%20raid">Indian Ocean raid</a> in April as she had to return to Japan for repairs after hitting a <a href="reef">reef</a> in February.

Following repairs, "Kaga" rejoined the <a href="1st%20Air%20Fleet%20of%20the%20Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">1st Air Fleet</a> for the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a> in June 1942. After bombarding American forces on <a href="Midway%20Atoll">Midway Atoll</a>, "Kaga" and three other IJN carriers were attacked by American aircraft from Midway and the carriers , , and . <a href="Dive%20bomber">Dive bomber</a>s from "Enterprise" severely damaged "Kaga"; when it became obvious she could not be saved, she was <a href="scuttling">scuttled</a> by Japanese <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s to prevent her from falling into enemy hands. The loss of four large attack carriers, including "Kaga" at Midway, was a crucial setback for Japan, and contributed significantly to Japan's ultimate defeat. In 1999, debris from "Kaga" including a large section of the <a href="hull%20%28watercraft%29">hull</a> was located on the ocean floor at a depth in excess of ; northwest of Midway Island. The main part of the carrier's wreck has not been found.

"Kaga" was laid down as a , and was launched on 17 November 1921 at the <a href="Kawasaki%20Heavy%20Industries">Kawasaki Heavy Industries</a> shipyard in <a href="Kobe">Kobe</a>. On 5 February 1922 both "Tosa"-class ships were canceled and scheduled to be <a href="scrap">scrap</a>ped under the terms of the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a>.

The Treaty authorized conversion of two battleship or battlecruiser hulls into aircraft carriers of up to standard displacement. The incomplete battlecruisers "Amagi" and were initially selected, but the <a href="1923%20Great%20Kant%C5%8D%20earthquake">Great Kantō earthquake</a> of 1923 damaged "Amagi"s hull beyond economically feasible repair, and "Kaga" was selected as her replacement. The formal decision to convert "Kaga" to an aircraft carrier was issued 13 December 1923, but no work took place until 1925 as new plans were drafted and earthquake damage to the <a href="Yokosuka%20Naval%20Arsenal">Yokosuka Naval Arsenal</a> was repaired. She was officially commissioned on 31 March 1928, but this signified only the beginning of sea trials. She joined the <a href="Combined%20Fleet">Combined Fleet</a> ("Rengō Kantai") on 30 November 1929 as the IJN's third carrier to enter service, after (1922) and "Akagi" (1927).

"Kaga" was completed with a length of <a href="length%20overall">overall</a>. She had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draft</a> at full load of . She displaced at standard load, and at full load, nearly less than her designed displacement as a battleship. Her complement totaled 1340 crewmembers.

"Kaga", like "Akagi", was completed with three superimposed flight decks, the only carriers ever to be designed so. The British carriers converted from "large light cruisers", , , and , each had two flight decks, but there is no evidence that the Japanese copied the British model. It is more likely that it was a case of convergent evolution to improve <a href="launch%20and%20recovery%20cycle">launch and recovery cycle</a> flexibility by allowing simultaneous launch and recovery of aircraft. "Kaga"s main flight deck was long and wide, her middle flight deck was only about long and started in front of the bridge, and her lower flight deck was approximately long. The utility of her middle flight deck was questionable as it was so short that only some of the lightly loaded aircraft could use it, even in an era when the aircraft were much lighter and smaller than they were during World War II. At any rate the ever-increasing growth in aircraft performance, size and weight during the 1930s meant that even the bottom flight deck was no longer able to accommodate the take-off roll required for the new generations of aircraft being fielded and it was plated over when the ship was modernized in the mid-1930s. "Kaga"s main flight deck was completely flat until a conning tower was added during the modernization.

As completed, the ship had two main hangar decks and a third auxiliary hangar with a total capacity of 60 aircraft. The hangars opened onto the middle and lower flight decks to allow aircraft to take off directly from the hangars while landing operations were in progress on the main flight deck above. No catapults were fitted. Her forward <a href="Elevator%23Aircraft%20elevators">aircraft lift</a> was offset to starboard and in size. Her aft lift was on the centerline and . Her <a href="arresting%20gear">arresting gear</a> was a French transverse system as used on their aircraft carrier and known as the Model Fju ("Fju shiki") in the Japanese service.

As originally completed, "Kaga" carried an air group of 28 <a href="Mitsubishi%20B1M">Mitsubishi B1M3 torpedo bombers</a>, 16 <a href="Nakajima%20A1N">Nakajima A1N</a> fighters and 16 <a href="Mitsubishi%202MR">Mitsubishi 2MR</a> reconnaissance aircraft.

"Kaga" was armed with ten <a href="20%20cm/50%203rd%20Year%20Type%20naval%20gun">20 cm/50 3rd Year Type guns</a>: one twin-gun Model B turret on each side of the middle flight deck and six in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s aft. They fired projectiles at a rate of three to six rounds per minute with a <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of ; at 25°, they had a maximum range between . The Model B turrets were nominally capable of 70° elevation to provide additional <a href="anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> (AA) fire, but in practice the maximum elevation was only 55°. The slow rate of fire and the fixed 5° loading angle minimized any real anti-aircraft capability. This heavy gun armament was provided in case she was surprised by enemy cruisers and forced to give battle, but her large and vulnerable flight deck, hangars, and other features made her more of a target in any surface action than a fighting warship. Carrier doctrine was still evolving at this time and the impracticability of carriers engaging in gun duels had not yet been realized.

She was given an anti-aircraft armament of six twin 45-<a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">caliber</a> 10th Year Type Model A2 gun mounts fitted on <a href="sponson">sponson</a>s below the level of the funnels, where they could not fire across the flight deck, three mounts per side. These guns fired projectiles at a <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of ; at 45° this provided a maximum range of , and they had a maximum ceiling of at 75° elevation. Their effective rate of fire was 6 to 8 rounds per minute. She had two Type 89 directors to control her 20 cm guns and two Type 91 manually powered anti-aircraft directors ("Kōshaki") to control her 12 cm guns.

"Kaga"s <a href="Belt%20armor">waterline armored belt</a> was reduced from during her reconstruction and the upper part of her <a href="Anti-torpedo%20bulge">torpedo bulge</a> was given of armor. Her <a href="Deck%20%28ship%29">deck armor</a> was also reduced from .

When "Kaga" was being designed, the problem of how to deal with exhaust gases in carrier operations had not been resolved. The swiveling funnels of had not proved successful and wind-tunnel testing had not provided an answer. As a result, "Akagi" and "Kaga" were given different exhaust systems to evaluate in real-world conditions. "Kaga"s funnel gases were collected in a pair of long horizontal ducts which discharged at the rear of each side of the flight deck, in spite of predictions by a number of prominent naval architects that they would not keep the hot gases away from the flight deck. The predictions proved to be correct, not least because "Kaga" was slower than the "Akagi" which allowed the gases to rise and interfere with landing operations. Another drawback was that the heat of the gases made the crew's quarters located on the side of the ship by the funnels almost uninhabitable.

"Kaga" was completed with four Kawasaki Brown-Curtis geared turbines with a total of on four shafts. As a battleship her expected speed had been , but the reduction in displacement from allowed this to increase to , as demonstrated on her <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s on 15 September 1928. She had twelve Kampon Type B (Ro) boilers with a working pressure of , although only eight were oil-fired. The other four used a mix of oil and coal. She carried of fuel oil and of coal to give her a range of at .

On 1 December 1931 "Kaga" was assigned as the flagship of the <a href="First%20Carrier%20Division">First Carrier Division</a> under the command of Rear Admiral <a href="Takayoshi%20Kat%C5%8D">Takayoshi Katō</a>. The First Carrier Division, along with "Hōshō", departed for Chinese waters on 29 January 1932 to support <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a> troops during the <a href="28%20January%20Incident">Shanghai Incident</a> as part of the IJN's <a href="IJN%203rd%20Fleet">3rd Fleet</a>. The B1M3s carried by "Kaga" and "Hōshō" were the main bombers used during the brief combat over Shanghai.

"Kaga"s aircraft, operating from both the carrier and a temporary base at Kunda Airfield in Shanghai, flew missions in support of Japanese ground forces throughout February 1932. During one of these missions three of "Kaga"s Nakajima A1N2 fighters, including one piloted by future ace <a href="Toshio%20Kuroiwa">Toshio Kuroiwa</a>, escorting three Mitsubishi B1M3 torpedo bombers, scored the IJN's first air-to-air combat victory on 22 February when they shot down a <a href="Boeing%20P-12">Boeing P-12</a> flown by an American volunteer pilot. "Kaga" returned to home waters upon the declaration of the cease-fire on 3 March and resumed fleet training with the rest of the Combined Fleet.

At this time, the IJN's developing carrier doctrine was still in its earliest stages. "Kaga" and the other carriers were initially given roles as tactical force multipliers supporting the fleet's battleships in the IJN's "<a href="Kantai%20Kessen">decisive battle</a>" doctrine. In this role, "Kaga"s aircraft were to attack enemy battleships with bombs and torpedoes. Aerial strikes against enemy carriers were later, beginning around 1932–1933, deemed of equal importance in order to establish <a href="air%20superiority">air superiority</a> during the initial stages of battle. The essential component in this strategy was that the Japanese carrier aircraft must be able to strike first with a massed aerial attack. As a result, in fleet training exercises the carriers began to operate together in front of or with the main battle line. This revolutionary strategy emphasized maximum speed from both the carriers and the aircraft they carried as well as larger aircraft with greater range. Thus, longer flight decks on the carriers were required in order to handle the newer, heavier aircraft which were entering service.

"Kaga" was soon judged inferior to "Akagi" because of her slower speed, smaller flight deck ( shorter), and problematic funnel arrangement. Because of "Kaga"s perceived limitations, she was given priority over "Akagi" for modernization. "Kaga" was relegated to reserve status on 20 October 1933 to begin a second major reconstruction, with an official start date of 25 June 1934.

During her second reconstruction "Kaga"s two lower flight decks were converted into hangars and, along with the main flight deck, were extended to the bow. This increased the flight deck length to and raised aircraft capacity to 90 (72 operational and 18 in storage). A third elevator forward, , serviced the extended hangars. Bomb and <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a> elevators were modified to deliver their munitions directly to the flight deck. Her arrester gear was replaced by a Japanese-designed Type 1 system. A small starboard island superstructure was also installed.

Her power plant was completely replaced as were her propellers. New Kampon multi-stage geared turbines were fitted that increased her power from during trials. Each had a high-pressure, a low-pressure, and a cruising turbine coupled to a single shaft. Her boilers were replaced by eight improved oil-burning models of the Kampon Type B (Ro) with a working pressure of at a temperature of . The hull was lengthened by at the stern to reduce drag and she was given another torpedo bulge above the side armor abreast the upper part of the existing bulge to increase her beam and lower her center of gravity as a result of lessons learned from the <a href="Tomozuru%20Incident">Tomozuru Incident</a> in early 1934. This raised her standard displacement significantly, from . The extra power and the extra displacement roughly offset each other and her speed increased by less than a knot, up to on trials. Her fuel storage was increased to of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> which increased her endurance to at . The lengthy funnel ducting was replaced by a single downturned starboard funnel modeled on that used by the "Akagi" with a water-cooling system for the exhaust gasses and a cover that could be raised to allow the exhaust gasses to escape if the ship developed a severe list and the mouth of the funnel touched the sea. The space freed up by the removal of the funnel ducts was divided into two decks and converted into living quarters for the expanded air group. The carrier's complement increased to 1708 crewmembers.

The two twin turrets on the middle flight deck were removed and four new 20 cm/50 3rd Year Type No. 1 guns in casemates were added forward. Her 12 cm anti-aircraft guns were replaced by eight /40 Type 89 guns in twin mounts. They fired projectiles at a rate between 8 and 14 rounds per minute at a <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of ; at 45°, this provided a maximum range of , and a maximum ceiling of . Their sponsons were raised one deck to allow them some measure of cross-deck fire. Eleven twin <a href="Type%2096%2025%20mm%20AT/AA%20Gun">25 mm Type 96</a> gun mounts were added, also on sponsons. They fired projectiles at a <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of ; at 50°, this provided a maximum range of , and an effective ceiling of . The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute due to the frequent need to change the fifteen-round magazines. Six <a href="Type%2011%20Light%20Machine%20Gun">Type 11</a> machine guns were also carried. Six Type 95 directors were fitted to control the new 25 mm guns, but "Kaga" retained her outdated Type 91 anti-aircraft directors.

Several major weaknesses in "Kaga"s design were not rectified. "Kaga"s aviation fuel tanks were incorporated directly into the structure of the carrier, meaning that shocks to the ship, such as those caused by bomb or shell hits, would be transmitted directly to the tanks, resulting in cracks or leaks. Also, the fully enclosed structure of the new hangar decks made fire suppression difficult, at least in part because fuel vapors could accumulate in the hangars. Adding to the danger was the requirement from the Japanese carrier doctrine that aircraft be serviced, fueled, and armed whenever possible on the hangar decks rather than on the flight deck. In addition, the carrier's hangar and flight decks carried little armor protection. Furthermore, there was no redundancy in the ship's fire-extinguishing systems. These weaknesses would later be crucial factors in the loss of the ship.

"Kaga" returned to service in 1935 and was assigned to the <a href="Second%20Carrier%20Division">Second Carrier Division</a>. The carrier embarked a new set of aircraft, including 16 <a href="Nakajima%20A2N">Nakajima A2N</a> Type 90 fighters, 16 <a href="Aichi%20D1A">Aichi D1A</a> Type 94 dive bombers, and 28 <a href="Mitsubishi%20B2M">Mitsubishi B2M</a> Type 89 torpedo bombers.

The renewal of hostilities with China at the <a href="Marco%20Polo%20Bridge%20Incident">Marco Polo Bridge</a> in July 1937 found "Kaga" in home waters. The ship's fighter squadron completed training at <a href="%C5%8Cmura%2C%20Nagasaki">Ōmura, Nagasaki</a> then helped escort ships taking army reinforcements from Japan to China. On 15 August, along with "Hōshō" and , the ship took station in the <a href="East%20China%20Sea">East China Sea</a> as part of the 3rd Fleet and began supporting Japanese military operations along the central China coast around Shanghai and further inland.

"Kaga" aircraft fought their first battle on 16 August 1937 when six Type 90 fighters engaged four Chinese aircraft over <a href="Jiangwan%20Airport">Kiangwan</a>, shooting down three without loss. Between 17 August and 7 September, "Kaga"s Type 90 and two <a href="Mitsubishi%20A5M">Mitsubishi A5M</a> Type 96 fighters, which joined the carrier on 22 August, engaged Chinese aircraft on several more occasions. "Kaga"s fighter pilots claimed to have shot down 10 Chinese aircraft in these encounters without loss. On 17 August twelve of the carrier's bombers attacked <a href="Hangchow">Hangchow</a> without fighter escort and 11 of them were shot down by Chinese fighters. Beginning on 15 September, six Type 90 and six Type 96 fighters, 18 dive bombers, and 18 torpedo bombers were temporarily deployed to Kunda Airfield from the ship to support land operations.
On 26 September the carrier went to <a href="Sasebo%2C%20Nagasaki">Sasebo</a> for reprovisioning. At Sasebo, the carrier received new replacement aircraft including 32 <a href="Yokosuka%20B4Y">Yokosuka B4Y</a> Type 96 carrier attack planes (torpedo bombers), 16 <a href="Aichi%20D1A2">Aichi D1A2</a> Type 96 carrier bombers (dive bombers), and 16 more Type 96 fighters. Several <a href="Nakajima%20A4N">Nakajima A4N</a> Type 95 fighter aircraft augmented the carrier's fighter group at an unspecified later date.

"Kaga" returned to the front in early October 1937, and except for two brief trips to Sasebo, remained off China until December 1938. Using <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> (then part of the <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Empire of Japan</a>) as its base, the carrier steamed supporting military operations from the <a href="South%20China%20Sea">South</a> and East China Seas. During that time, "Kaga" bombers supported army operations by attacking enemy railroad bridges, airfields, and transportation vehicles. The carrier's fighter pilots claimed to have destroyed at least 17 Chinese aircraft in aerial combat while losing five aircraft themselves. On 12 December 1937 "Kaga" aircraft participated in the <a href="Panay%20incident">Panay incident</a>.

"Kaga" entered the shipyard on 15 December 1938, where her arresting gear was replaced by a Type 3 system and her bridge was modernized. The flight deck and hangar areas were enlarged, increasing the carrier's aircraft capacity. The ship was completely overhauled from 15 November 1939 to 15 November 1940 before returning to active service. In the meantime, a new generation of aircraft had entered service and "Kaga" embarked 12 <a href="Mitsubishi%20A5M">Mitsubishi A5M</a> fighters, 24 <a href="Aichi%20D1A">Aichi D1A</a> dive bombers and 36 <a href="Yokosuka%20B4Y">Yokosuka B4Y</a> torpedo bombers. Another 18 aircraft were carried in crates as spares.

The Japanese carriers' experiences off China had helped further develop the IJN's carrier doctrine. One lesson learned in China was the importance of concentration and mass in projecting naval air power ashore. Therefore, in April 1941 the IJN formed the <a href="1st%20Air%20Fleet%20of%20the%20Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">First Air Fleet</a> to combine all of its fleet carriers under a single command. On 10 April 1941 "Kaga" was assigned to the First Carrier Division with "Akagi" as part of the new carrier fleet, which also included the Second and <a href="Fifth%20Carrier%20Division">Fifth</a> carrier divisions. The IJN centered its doctrine on air strikes that combined the air groups within carrier divisions, rather than each individual carrier. When more than one carrier division was operating together, the divisions' air groups were combined with each other. This doctrine of combined, massed, carrier air attack groups was the most advanced of its kind of all the world's navies. The IJN, however, remained concerned that concentrating all of its carriers together would render them vulnerable to being wiped out all at once by a massive enemy air or surface strike. Thus, the IJN developed a compromise solution in which the fleet carriers would operate closely together within their carrier divisions but the divisions themselves would operate in loose rectangular formations, with approximately separating the carriers from each other.

Although the concentration of so many fleet carriers into a single unit was a new and revolutionary offensive strategic concept, the First Air Fleet suffered from several defensive deficiencies which gave it, in <a href="Mark%20Peattie">Mark Peattie</a>'s words, a <a href="wikt%3Aglass%20jaw">glass jaw</a>': it could throw a punch but couldn't take one." Japanese carrier anti-aircraft guns and associated fire control systems had several design and configuration deficiencies which limited their effectiveness. The IJN's fleet <a href="combat%20air%20patrol">combat air patrol</a> (CAP) consisted of too few fighter aircraft and was hampered by an inadequate early warning system, including a lack of <a href="radar">radar</a>. Poor radio communications with the fighter aircraft inhibited effective command and control of the CAP. The carriers' escorting warships were deployed as visual scouts in a ring at long range, not as close anti-aircraft escorts, as they lacked training, doctrine, and sufficient anti-aircraft guns. These deficiencies would eventually doom "Kaga" and other First Air Fleet carriers.

In November 1941 the IJN's Combined Fleet, under <a href="Isoroku%20Yamamoto">Isoroku Yamamoto</a>, prepared to participate in Japan's initiation of a formal war with the United States by conducting a preemptive strike against the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>'s <a href="United%20States%20Pacific%20Fleet">Pacific Fleet</a> base at <a href="Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a>, Hawaii. On 17 November "Kaga", under the command of Captain Jisaku Okada, loaded 100 torpedoes at Saeki Bay, Hiroshima; these torpedoes were specially designed for use in the shallow waters of the Pearl Harbor anchorage. On 19 November, "Kaga" and the rest of the Combined Fleet's mobile strike force (<a href="1st%20Air%20Fleet%20of%20the%20Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%23Kido%20Butai">"Kido Butai"</a>), under <a href="Chuichi%20Nagumo">Chuichi Nagumo</a> and including six fleet carriers from the First, Second, and Fifth Carrier Divisions, assembled in Hitokappu Bay at <a href="Etorofu%20Island">Etorofu Island</a>. The fleet departed Etorofu on 26 November and followed a course across the north-central Pacific to avoid commercial shipping lanes.

For the attack on Pearl Harbor, "Kaga" carried a total of 18 <a href="Mitsubishi%20A6M">Mitsubishi A6M</a> Zero <a href="Fighter%20aircraft">fighters</a>, 27 <a href="Nakajima%20B5N">Nakajima B5N</a> torpedo bombers and 27 <a href="Aichi%20D3A">Aichi D3A</a> dive bombers, plus three crated aircraft of each type for the operation. During the morning of 7 December 1941 "Kaga" aircraft participated in both First Air Fleet strikes launched against <a href="Oahu">Oahu</a> from a position north of the island. In the first strike of 183 total aircraft (six aborted), 26 "Kaga" B5N carrier attack bombers attacked the American ships at anchor with bombs and torpedoes, escorted by nine Zeros. In the second strike of 167 aircraft (four aborted), 26 "Kaga" D3A dive bombers targeted the airfield at <a href="Ford%20Island">Ford Island</a> in the middle of the harbor while nine Zeros provided escort and attacked aircraft on the ground. A total of five B5Ns, four Zeros and six D3As from the ship were lost during the two strikes, along with their aircrews, a total of 31 personnel. "Kaga"s bomber and torpedo crews claimed hits on the battleships , , , , , and . The ship's fighter pilots claimed to have shot down one US aircraft and destroyed 20 on the ground. Upon completion of the attack, the First and Fifth Carrier divisions, including "Kaga", returned immediately to Japan.

In January 1942, together with the rest of the First and <a href="Fifth%20Carrier%20Division">Fifth Carrier Division</a> carriers and staging out of <a href="Chuuk%20Lagoon">Truk</a> (now Chuuk) in Micronesia, "Kaga" supported the <a href="battle%20of%20Rabaul%20%281942%29">invasion of Rabaul</a> in the <a href="Bismarck%20Islands">Bismarck Islands</a>. "Kaga" provided 27 bomb-carrying B5N and 9 Zeros for the initial airstrike on <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> on 20 January 1942, during which one B5N was shot down by anti-aircraft fire. The First Carrier Division attacked Allied positions at nearby <a href="Kavieng">Kavieng</a> the following day, of which "Kaga" contributed nine Zeros and sixteen D3As. On the 22nd "Kaga"s D3As and Zeros again attacked Rabaul and two dive bombers had to make emergency landings, but the crews were rescued. "Kaga" returned to Truk on 25 January and Rabaul and Kavieng were successfully occupied by Japanese forces by February.

On 9 February "Kaga" hit a reef at <a href="Palau">Palau</a> after she had unsuccessfully sortied against American carrier forces <a href="Marshalls-Gilberts%20raids">attacking</a> the <a href="Marshall%20Islands">Marshall Islands</a> on 1 February. The damage reduced the carrier's speed to 18 knots. After temporary repairs, she continued to the <a href="Timor%20Sea">Timor Sea</a>, where on 19 February 1942 she, with the other carriers of the First and <a href="Second%20Carrier%20Division">Second Carrier Division</a>s, launched <a href="Bombing%20of%20Darwin">air strikes</a> against <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>, Australia from a point southeast of the easternmost tip of <a href="Timor">Timor</a>. "Kaga" contributed 27 B5Ns (carrying bombs), 18 D3A, and 9 Zeros to the attack, which caught the defenders by surprise. Eight ships were sunk, including the <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> , and fourteen more were damaged, at a cost of only one of "Kaga"s B5Ns. In March 1942, "Kaga", based out of <a href="Staring-baai">Staring-baai</a>, helped cover the invasion of <a href="Java%20%28island%29">Java</a>, although her only contribution appears to have been aircraft for the 5 March 1942 airstrike on <a href="Cilacap%20Regency">Tjilatjap</a>. In that attack "Kaga" contributed 27 bomb-carrying B5N escorted by nine Zeros. The attacking aircraft bombed merchant ships in the harbor, sinking eight of them, and attacked anti-aircraft batteries and a warehouse without loss. Most of the Allied forces in the Dutch East Indies surrendered to the Japanese later in March. "Kaga" was unable to participate in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean%20raid">Indian Ocean raid</a> in April because of the damage she had received in February. Instead, she sailed for <a href="Sasebo%2C%20Nagasaki">Sasebo</a> on 15 March for repairs, entering <a href="drydock">drydock</a> on 27 March. The repairs were completed on 4 May.

Concerned by the US carrier strikes such as the <a href="Doolittle%20Raid">Doolittle Raid</a>, on the Marshall Islands, and the <a href="Invasion%20of%20Lae-Salamaua">Lae-Salamaua</a> raids, Yamamoto was determined to force the US Navy into a showdown to eliminate the American carrier threat. Yamamoto decided to invade and occupy <a href="Midway%20Island">Midway Island</a>, which he was sure would draw out the American carrier forces to battle. The Midway invasion was codenamed by the Japanese as Operation "MI".

In support of "MI", on 27 May 1942, "Kaga" departed the <a href="Seto%20Inland%20Sea">Inland Sea</a> with the Combined Fleet on her final mission, in the company of carriers "Akagi", , and which constituted the First and Second Carrier Divisions. Her aircraft complement was 27 Zeros, 20 D3As, and 27 B5Ns. With the fleet positioned northwest of <a href="Midway%20Island">Midway Island</a> at dawn on 4 June 1942, "Kaga" contributed eighteen D3As, commanded by Lieutenant Shōichi Ogawa, escorted by nine Zeros to the strike against the island. The carrier's B5Ns were armed with torpedoes and kept ready in case enemy ships were discovered during the Midway raid. One each of the D3As and Zeros was shot down by AA fire over Midway, and another four D3As were damaged. "Kaga"s Zero pilots claimed to have shot down 12 US aircraft over Midway Island. One "Kaga" B5N was launched to augment the fleet's reconnaissance of the surrounding ocean. The carrier also put up two Zeros on CAP. Another five Zeros reinforced her CAP at 07:00 and the seven fighters helped to defend the Kido Butai from the first US air attackers from Midway Island at 07:10. Unknown to the Japanese, the US Navy had divined the Japanese "MI" plan from <a href="signals%20intelligence">signals intelligence</a> and had prepared an ambush using its three available carriers, positioned northeast of Midway.

At 07:15 <a href="Ch%C5%ABichi%20Nagumo">Admiral Nagumo</a> ordered the B5Ns still on "Kaga" and "Akagi" rearmed with bombs for another attack on Midway itself. This process was limited by the number of ordnance carts used to handle the bombs and <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>es and the limited number of ordnance elevators. Thus, the torpedoes could not be struck below until after all the bombs were moved up from their <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a>, assembled and mounted on the aircraft. This process normally took about an hour and a half; more time would be required to bring the aircraft up to the flight deck and warm up and launch the strike group. Around 07:40 Nagumo reversed his order when he received a message that American carriers had been spotted. At 07:30 "Kaga" recovered three of her CAP.

"Kaga"s four remaining CAP fighters were in the process of landing when 16 <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">Marine</a> <a href="SBD%20Dauntless">SBD Dauntless</a> dive-bombers from Midway, led by <a href="Lofton%20R.%20Henderson">Lofton R. Henderson</a>, attacked <a href="Japanese_aircraft_carrier%20Hiryu">"Hiryu"</a> around 07:55 without result. Five Zeros were launched at 08:15 and three intercepted a dozen Midway-based <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> <a href="B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">B-17 Flying Fortress</a>es attempting to bomb the three other carriers from , but only limited damage was inflicted on the heavy bombers, although their attacks all missed. Five D3As also joined the CAP around this time. Another trio of Zeros were launched at 08:30. "Kaga" began landing her returning Midway strike force aboard around 08:35 and was finished by 08:50; one Zero pilot died after crash-landing his aircraft.

The five Zeros launched at 08:15 were recovered aboard at 09:10 and replaced by six more Zeros launched at 09:20. They intercepted the first US carrier aircraft to attack, <a href="TBD%20Devastator">TBD Devastator</a> torpedo-bombers of <a href="VT-8">VT-8</a> from the US carrier at 09:22, and shot down all 15, leaving only a single survivor, <a href="George%20H.%20Gay%2C%20Jr.">George H. Gay, Jr.</a>, treading water. Shortly thereafter, 14 Devastators from <a href="Torpedo%20Squadron%206">VT-6</a> from the US carrier , led by <a href="Eugene%20E.%20Lindsey">Eugene E. Lindsey</a>, were spotted. They tried to sandwich "Kaga", but the CAP, reinforced by another six Zeros launched by "Kaga" at 10:00, shot down all but four of the Devastators, and the carrier dodged the torpedoes.

Soon after the torpedo plane attacks, American carrier dive bombers arrived over the Japanese carriers almost undetected and began their dives. At 10:22, 25 SBD Dauntless dive-bombers from "Enterprise", led by <a href="C.%20Wade%20McClusky">C. Wade McClusky</a>, hit "Kaga" with one bomb and at least three bombs. The first landed near her rear elevator and set the berthing compartments on fire, and the next bomb hit the forward elevator and penetrated the upper hangar, setting off explosions and fires among the armed and fueled planes on her hangar deck. Captain Okada and most of the ship's senior officers were killed by the third bomb, which hit the bridge. The 1000-pound bomb hit amidships and penetrated the flight deck to explode on the upper hangar. The explosions ruptured the ship's <a href="avgas">avgas</a> lines, damaged both her port and starboard fire mains and the emergency generator powering her fire pumps, as well as knocking out the <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> fire suppression system. Fueled by the avgas pouring onto the hangar deck, the fires detonated the of bombs and torpedoes strewn across the hangar deck in a series of catastrophic multiple fuel-air explosions that blew out the hangar sides. At nearly the same time, dive bombers hit and fatally damaged "Akagi" and "Sōryū".

Unable to contain her fires, "Kaga" survivors were taken off by the destroyers and between 14:00 and 17:00. Around 19:25 she was scuttled by two torpedoes from <a href="Japanese%20destroyer%20Hagikaze">"Hagikaze"</a> and sank stern-first at position . <a href="Ensign%20%28rank%29">Ensign</a> Takeshi Maeda, an injured "Kaga" B5N aircrew member rescued by "Hagikaze", described the scene: "My comrade carried me up to the deck so I could see the last moments of our beloved carrier, which was nearby. Even though I was in pain tears started to run down my cheeks, and everyone around me was crying; it was a very sad sight."

The carrier's crew suffered 811 fatalities, mainly among the aircraft mechanics and armorers stationed on the hangar decks and the ship's engineers, many of whom were trapped below in the boiler and engine rooms by uncontrolled fires raging on the decks above them. Twenty-one of the ship's aviators were killed. The loss of "Kaga" and the three other IJN carriers at Midway ("Hiryū" was also sunk during the battle), with their aircraft and veteran pilots, was a crucial strategic defeat for Japan and contributed significantly to Japan's ultimate defeat in the war.

In May 1999, the Nauticos Corporation, in partnership with the US Navy, discovered some wreckage from "Kaga". They employed the research vessel during a survey of a fleet exercise area with the US Navy's recently modified SEAMAP acoustic imaging system. A follow-on search by in September 1999 located the wreckage and took photos of it. The wreckage included a long section of hangar bulkhead, two 25 mm anti-aircraft gun tubs, and a landing light array. The artifacts were at a depth of .

Born in <a href="Glen%20Ridge%2C%20New%20Jersey">Glen Ridge, New Jersey</a>, Aldrin graduated from the <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">United States Military Academy</a> at West Point in 1951, with a degree in <a href="mechanical%20engineering">mechanical engineering</a>. He was commissioned into the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a>, and served as a jet <a href="fighter%20pilot">fighter pilot</a> during the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>. He flew 66 <a href="Aerial%20warfare">combat missions</a> and shot down two <a href="MiG-15">MiG-15</a> aircraft.

After earning a <a href="Sc.D.">Sc.D.</a> degree in <a href="astronautics">astronautics</a> from the <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>, Aldrin was selected as a member of <a href="NASA">NASA</a>'s <a href="Astronaut%20Group%203">Astronaut Group 3</a>, making him the first astronaut with a doctoral degree. His doctoral thesis was "Line-of-Sight Guidance Techniques for Manned Orbital Rendezvous", earning him the nickname "Dr. Rendezvous" from fellow astronauts. His first space flight was in 1966 on <a href="Gemini%2012">Gemini 12</a> during which he spent over five hours on <a href="extravehicular%20activity">extravehicular activity</a>. Three years later, Aldrin set foot on the Moon at 03:15:16 on July 21, 1969 (<a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a>), nine minutes after Armstrong first touched the surface, while <a href="Command%20Module%20Pilot">Command Module Pilot</a> <a href="Michael%20Collins%20%28astronaut%29">Michael Collins</a> remained in lunar orbit. A <a href="Presbyterian%20Church%20%28U.S.A.%29">Presbyterian</a> <a href="Elder%20%28Presbyterian%29">elder</a>, Aldrin became the first person to hold a religious ceremony on the Moon when he privately took <a href="Eucharist">communion</a>.

Upon leaving NASA in 1971, he became Commandant of the <a href="U.S.%20Air%20Force%20Test%20Pilot%20School">U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School</a>. He retired from the Air Force in 1972, after 21 years of service. His autobiographies "Return to Earth," (1973) and "<a href="Magnificent%20Desolation%20%28book%29">Magnificent Desolation</a>" (2009), recount his struggles with <a href="clinical%20depression">clinical depression</a> and <a href="alcoholism">alcoholism</a> in the years after leaving NASA. He continued to advocate for space exploration, particularly a <a href="human%20mission%20to%20Mars">human mission to Mars</a>, and developed the <a href="Aldrin%20cycler">Aldrin cycler</a>, a special spacecraft <a href="trajectory">trajectory</a> that makes travel to Mars possible using less time and propellant. He has been accorded numerous honors, including the <a href="Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a> in 1969, and is listed in several <a href="List%20of%20halls%20and%20walks%20of%20fame">Halls of Fame</a>.

Edwin Eugene Aldrin Jr. was born on January 20, 1930, at <a href="Mountainside%20Hospital">Mountainside Hospital</a> in <a href="Glen%20Ridge%2C%20New%20Jersey">Glen Ridge</a>, <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>. His parents, <a href="Edwin%20Eugene%20Aldrin%20Sr.">Edwin Eugene Aldrin Sr.</a> and Marion Aldrin ( Moon), lived in neighboring <a href="Montclair%2C%20New%20Jersey">Montclair, New Jersey</a>. His father was an Army aviator during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> and the assistant commandant of the Army's test pilot school at <a href="McCook%20Field">McCook Field</a>, Ohio, from 1919 to 1922, but left the Army in 1928 and became an executive at <a href="Standard%20Oil">Standard Oil</a>. Aldrin had two siblings, both sisters: Madeleine, who was four years older, and Fay Ann, who was a year and a half older. His nickname, which became his legal first name in 1988, arose as a result of Fay's mispronouncing "brother" as "buzzer", which was then shortened to "Buzz". He was a <a href="Scouts%20BSA%20%28Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America%29">Boy Scout</a>, with the rank of <a href="Ranks%20in%20the%20Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America%23Tenderfoot%20Scout">Tenderfoot Scout</a>.

Aldrin did well in school, maintaining an A average. He played <a href="American%20football">football</a> and was the starting <a href="center%20%28gridiron%20football%29">center</a> for <a href="Montclair%20High%20School%20%28New%20Jersey%29">Montclair High School</a>'s undefeated 1946 state champion team. His father wanted him to go to the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a> in <a href="Annapolis%2C%20Maryland">Annapolis, Maryland</a> and enrolled him at nearby <a href="Severn%20School">Severn School</a>, a <a href="College-preparatory%20school">preparatory school</a> for Annapolis and even secured him an appointment from <a href="Albert%20W.%20Hawkes">Albert W. Hawkes</a>, one of the <a href="United%20States%20Senator">United States Senator</a>s from New Jersey. Aldrin attended Severn School in 1946, but had other ideas about his future career. He suffered from seasickness and considered ships a distraction from flying airplanes. He faced down his father and told him to ask Hawkes to change the nomination to the <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">United States Military Academy</a> at <a href="West%20Point%2C%20New%20York">West Point, New York</a>.

Aldrin entered West Point in 1947. He did well academically, finishing first in his class his plebe (first) year. He was a member of the academy <a href="track%20and%20field">track and field</a> team. In 1950 he traveled with a group of West Point cadets to Japan and the Philippines to study the military government policies of <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>. During his trip, the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> broke out. On June 5, 1951, he graduated third in the class of 1951 with a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Science">Bachelor of Science</a> degree.

As one of the highest-ranking members of the class, Aldrin had his choice of assignments. He chose the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a>, which had become a separate service in 1947 while Aldrin was still at West Point and did not yet have its own academy. He was commissioned as a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a>, and underwent basic flight training in <a href="T-6%20Texan">T-6 Texan</a>s at <a href="Bartow%20Air%20Base">Bartow Air Base</a> in <a href="Florida">Florida</a>. His classmates included <a href="Sam%20Johnson">Sam Johnson</a>, who later became a <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoner of war</a> in Vietnam; the two became friends. At one point, Aldrin attempted a double <a href="Immelmann%20turn">Immelmann turn</a> in a <a href="T-28%20Trojan">T-28 Trojan</a> and suffered a <a href="grayout">grayout</a>. He recovered in time to pull out at , averting what would have been a fatal crash.
When deciding what sort of aircraft he should fly, his father advised him to choose <a href="bomber">bomber</a>s, because command of a bomber crew gave an opportunity to learn and hone leadership skills, which could open up better prospects for career advancement. Aldrin chose instead to fly <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighter</a>s. He moved to <a href="Nellis%20Air%20Force%20Base">Nellis Air Force Base</a> in <a href="Las%20Vegas">Las Vegas</a>, where he learned to fly the <a href="F-80%20Shooting%20Star">F-80 Shooting Star</a> and the <a href="F-86%20Sabre">F-86 Sabre</a>. Like most jet <a href="fighter%20pilot">fighter pilot</a>s of the era, he preferred the latter.

In December 1952, Aldrin was assigned to the <a href="16th%20Fighter-Interceptor%20Squadron">16th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron</a>, which was part of the <a href="51st%20Fighter-Interceptor%20Wing">51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing</a>. At the time it was based at <a href="Suwon%20Air%20Base">Suwon Air Base</a>, about south of <a href="Seoul">Seoul</a>, and was engaged in combat operations as part of the Korean War. During an acclimatization flight his main fuel system froze at 100 percent power, which would have soon used up all his fuel. He was able to override the setting manually, but this required holding a button down, which in turn made it impossible to also use his radio. He barely managed to make it back under enforced radio silence. He flew 66 <a href="Aerial%20warfare">combat missions</a> in F-86 Sabres in Korea and shot down two <a href="MiG-15">MiG-15</a> aircraft.

The first Mig-15 he shot down was on May 14, 1953. Aldrin was flying about south of the <a href="Yalu%20River">Yalu River</a>, when he saw two MiG-15 fighters below him. Aldrin opened fire on one of the MiGs, whose pilot may never have seen him coming. The June 8, 1953, issue of "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" magazine featured gun camera footage taken by Aldrin of the pilot ejecting from his damaged aircraft.
Aldrin's second aerial victory came on June 4, 1953, when he accompanied aircraft from the <a href="39th%20Fighter-Interceptor%20Squadron">39th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron</a> in an attack on an airbase in North Korea. Their newer aircraft were faster than his and he had trouble keeping up. He then spotted a MiG approaching from above. This time, Aldrin and his opponent spotted each other at about the same time. They went through a series of <a href="The%20Scissors">scissor maneuvers</a>, attempting to get behind the other. Aldrin was first to do so, but his gun sight jammed. He then manually sighted his gun and fired. He then had to pull out, as the two aircraft had gotten too low for the dogfight to continue. Aldrin saw the MiG's canopy open and the pilot eject, although Aldrin was uncertain whether there was sufficient time for a parachute to open. For his service in Korea, he was awarded two <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Distinguished Flying Crosses</a> and three <a href="Air%20Medal">Air Medal</a>s.

Aldrin's year-long tour ended in December 1953, by which time the fighting in Korea had ended. Aldrin was assigned as an <a href="Air%20gunner">aerial gunnery</a> instructor at Nellis. In December 1954 he became an <a href="aide-de-camp">aide-de-camp</a> to <a href="Brigadier%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Brigadier General</a> <a href="Don%20Z.%20Zimmerman">Don Z. Zimmerman</a>, the <a href="Dean%20of%20Faculty">Dean of Faculty</a> at the nascent <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force%20Academy">United States Air Force Academy</a>, which opened in 1955. That same year, he graduated from the <a href="Squadron%20Officer%20School">Squadron Officer School</a> at <a href="Maxwell%20Air%20Force%20Base">Maxwell Air Force Base</a> in <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a>. From 1956 to 1959 he flew <a href="F-100%20Super%20Sabre">F-100 Super Sabre</a>s equipped with <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s as a flight commander in the <a href="22nd%20Fighter%20Squadron">22nd Fighter Squadron</a>, <a href="36th%20Fighter%20Wing">36th Fighter Wing</a>, stationed at <a href="Bitburg%20Air%20Base">Bitburg Air Base</a> in West Germany. Among his squadron colleagues was <a href="Ed%20White%20%28astronaut%29">Ed White</a>, who had been a year behind him at West Point. After White left Germany to study for a master's degree at the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a> in <a href="aeronautical%20engineering">aeronautical engineering</a>, he wrote to Aldrin encouraging him to do the same.
Through the <a href="Air%20Force%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Air Force Institute of Technology</a>, Aldrin enrolled as a graduate student at the <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT) in 1959, intending to earn a master's degree. His <a href="astrodynamics">astrodynamics</a> class was taught by <a href="Richard%20Battin">Richard Battin</a>. Two other USAF officers who later became astronauts, <a href="David%20Scott">David Scott</a> and <a href="Edgar%20Mitchell">Edgar Mitchell</a> took this course around this time, while another, <a href="Charles%20Duke">Charles Duke</a> wrote his 1964 master's degree at MIT under the supervision of <a href="Laurence%20R.%20Young">Laurence R. Young</a>.

Aldrin enjoyed the classwork and soon decided to pursue a doctorate instead. In January 1963, he earned a <a href="Sc.D.">Sc.D.</a> degree in <a href="astronautics">astronautics</a>. His doctoral thesis was "Line-of-Sight Guidance Techniques for Manned Orbital Rendezvous", the dedication of which read: "In the hopes that this work may in some way contribute to their exploration of space, this is dedicated to the crew members of this country's present and future manned space programs. If only I could join them in their exciting endeavors!" Aldrin chose his doctoral thesis in the hope that it would help him be selected as an astronaut, although it meant foregoing <a href="test%20pilot">test pilot</a> training, which was a prerequisite at the time.

On the completion of his doctorate, Aldrin was assigned to the Gemini Target Office of the Air Force Space Systems Division in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, working with the <a href="Lockheed%20Aircraft%20Corporation">Lockheed Aircraft Corporation</a> on enhancing the maneuver capabilities of the <a href="Agena%20target%20vehicle">Agena target vehicle</a> which was to be used by <a href="NASA">NASA</a>'s <a href="Project%20Gemini">Project Gemini</a>. He was then posted to the Space Systems Division's field office at NASA's <a href="Manned%20Spacecraft%20Center">Manned Spacecraft Center</a> in <a href="Houston">Houston</a>, where he was involved in integrating <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">Department of Defense</a> experiments into Project Gemini flights.

Aldrin's initial application to join the astronaut corps when NASA's <a href="Astronaut%20Group%202">Astronaut Group 2</a> was selected in 1962 was rejected on the ground that he was not a test pilot. He was aware of the requirement and asked for it to be waived, but the request was turned down. On May 15, 1963, NASA announced another round of selections, this time with the requirement that applicants had either test pilot experience or 1,000 hours of flying time in jet aircraft. Aldrin had over 2,500 hours of flying time, of which 2,200 was in jets. His selection as one of fourteen members of NASA's <a href="Astronaut%20Group%203">Astronaut Group 3</a> was announced on October 18, 1963. This made him the first astronaut with a doctoral degree which, combined with his expertise in orbital mechanics, earned him the nickname "Dr. Rendezvous" from his fellow astronauts. Aldrin was aware that it was not always intended as a compliment.

On completion of their initial astronaut training, each of the new astronauts was assigned a field of expertise that they were to specialize in. In Aldrin's case, this was mission planning, trajectory analysis and flight plans.
<a href="Jim%20Lovell">Jim Lovell</a> and Aldrin were selected as the backup crew of <a href="Gemini%2010">Gemini 10</a>, commander and pilot respectively. Backup crews usually became the prime crew of the third following mission, but the last scheduled mission in the program was <a href="Gemini%2012">Gemini 12</a>. The February 28, 1966, deaths of the <a href="Gemini%209">Gemini 9</a> prime crew, <a href="Elliot%20See">Elliot See</a> and <a href="Charles%20Bassett">Charles Bassett</a>, in an <a href="1966%20NASA%20T-38%20crash">air crash</a>, led to Lovell and Aldrin being moved up one mission to backup for Gemini 9, which put them in position as prime crew for Gemini 12. They were designated its prime crew on June 17, 1966, with <a href="Gordon%20Cooper">Gordon Cooper</a> and <a href="Gene%20Cernan">Gene Cernan</a> as their backups.

Initially, Gemini 12's mission objectives were uncertain. As the last scheduled mission, it was primarily intended to complete tasks that had not been successfully or fully carried out on earlier missions. While NASA had successfully performed rendezvous during Project Gemini, the <a href="gravity-gradient%20stabilization">gravity-gradient stabilization</a> test on <a href="Gemini%2011">Gemini 11</a> was unsuccessful. NASA also had concerns about <a href="extravehicular%20activity">extravehicular activity</a> (EVA). Cernan on Gemini 9 and <a href="Richard%20F.%20Gordon%20Jr.">Richard Gordon</a> on Gemini 11 had suffered from fatigue carrying out tasks during EVA, but <a href="Michael%20Collins%20%28astronaut%29">Michael Collins</a> had a successful EVA on Gemini 10, which suggested that the order in which he had performed his tasks was an important factor.

It therefore fell to Aldrin to complete Gemini's EVA goals. NASA formed a committee to give him a better chance of success. It dropped the test of the Air Force's astronaut maneuvering unit (AMU) that had given Gordon trouble on Gemini 11 so Aldrin could focus on EVA. NASA revamped the training program, opting for underwater training over <a href="parabolic%20flight">parabolic flight</a>. Aircraft flying a parabolic trajectory had given astronauts an experience of weightlessness in training, but there was a delay between each parabola which gave astronauts several minutes of rest. It also encouraged performing tasks quickly, whereas in space they had to be done slowly and deliberately. Training in a viscous, buoyant fluid gave a better simulation. NASA also placed additional handholds on the capsule, which were increased from 9 on Gemini 9 to 44 on Gemini 12, and created workstations where he could anchor his feet.
Gemini 12's main objectives were to rendezvous with a target vehicle, and fly the spacecraft and target vehicle together using gravity-gradient stabilization, perform docked maneuvers using the Agena propulsion system to change orbit, conduct a tethered stationkeeping exercise and three EVAs, and demonstrate an automatic reentry. Gemini 12 also carried 14 scientific, medical, and technological experiments. It was not a trailblazing mission; rendezvous from above had already been successfully performed by Gemini 9, and the tethered vehicle exercise by Gemini 11. Even gravity-gradient stabilization had been attempted by Gemini 11, albeit unsuccessfully.

Gemini 12 was launched from <a href="Launch%20Complex%2019">Launch Complex 19</a> at <a href="Cape%20Canaveral">Cape Canaveral</a> on 20:46 UTC on November 11, 1966. The <a href="Gemini%20Agena%20Target%20Vehicle">Gemini Agena Target Vehicle</a> had been launched about an hour and a half before. The mission's first major objective was to rendezvous with this target vehicle. As the target and Gemini 12 capsule drew closer together, radar contact between the two deteriorated until it became unusable, forcing the crew to rendezvous manually. Aldrin used a <a href="sextant">sextant</a> and rendezvous charts he helped create to give Lovell the right information to put the spacecraft in position to dock with the target vehicle. Gemini 12 achieved the fourth <a href="Docking%20and%20berthing%20of%20spacecraft">docking</a> with an Agena target vehicle.

The next task was to practice undocking and docking again. On undocking, one of the three latches caught, and Lovell had to use the Gemini's thrusters to free the spacecraft. Aldrin then docked again successfully a few minutes later. The flight plan then called for the Agena main engine to be fired to take the docked spacecraft into a higher orbit, but eight minutes after the Agena had been launched, it had suffered a loss of chamber pressure. The Mission and Flight Directors therefore decided not to risk the main engine. This would be the only mission objective that was not achieved. Instead, the Agena's secondary propulsion system was used to allow the spacecraft to view the <a href="solar%20eclipse%20of%20November%2012%2C%201966">solar eclipse of November 12, 1966</a>, over South America, which Lovell and Aldrin photographed through the spacecraft windows.

Aldrin performed three EVAs. The first was a standup EVA on November 12, in which the spacecraft door was opened and he stood up, but did not leave the spacecraft. The standup EVA mimicked some of the actions he would do during his free-flight EVA, so he could compare the effort expended between the two. It set an EVA record of two hours and 20 minutes. The next day Aldrin performed his free-flight EVA. He climbed across the newly installed hand-holds to the Agena and installed the cable needed for the gravity-gradient stabilization experiment. Aldrin performed numerous tasks, including installing electrical connectors and testing tools that would be needed for <a href="Project%20Apollo">Project Apollo</a>. A dozen two-minute rest periods prevented him from becoming fatigued. His second EVA concluded after two hours and six minutes. A third, 55-minute standup EVA was conducted on November 14, during which Aldrin took photographs, conducted experiments, and discarded some unneeded items.

On November 15, the crew initiated the automatic reentry system and <a href="splashdown">splashed down</a> in the Atlantic Ocean, from whence they were picked up by a helicopter which took them to the awaiting aircraft carrier . After the mission, his wife realized he had fallen into a depression, something she had not seen before.

Lovell and Aldrin were assigned to an Apollo crew with <a href="Neil%20Armstrong">Neil Armstrong</a> as Commander, Lovell as Command Module Pilot (CMP) and Aldrin as Lunar Module Pilot (LMP). Their assignment as the backup crew of <a href="Apollo%209">Apollo 9</a> was officially announced on November 20, 1967. Due to design and manufacturing delays in the lunar module (LM), <a href="Apollo%208">Apollo 8</a> and Apollo 9 swapped prime and backup crews, and Armstrong's crew became the backup for Apollo 8. Under the normal crew rotation scheme, Armstrong was then expected to command <a href="Apollo%2011">Apollo 11</a>.
Michael Collins, the CMP on the Apollo 8 prime crew, experienced trouble with his legs that required surgery to remove a bone spur on his spine. Lovell took his place on the Apollo 8 crew. When Collins recovered he joined Armstrong's crew as CMP. In the meantime, <a href="Fred%20Haise">Fred Haise</a> filled in as backup LMP, and Aldrin as backup CMP for Apollo 8. An effect of this was that while the CMP usually occupied the center couch on takeoff, Aldrin occupied it rather than Collins, as he had already been trained to operate its console on liftoff before Collins arrived.

Apollo 11 was the second crew of an American space mission made up entirely of astronauts who had already flown in space, the first being that of Apollo 10. The next would not be flown until <a href="STS-26">STS-26</a> in 1988. <a href="Deke%20Slayton">Deke Slayton</a>, who was responsible for astronaut flight assignments, gave Armstrong the option to replace Aldrin with Lovell, since some thought Aldrin was difficult to work with. Armstrong thought it over for a day before declining. He had no issues working with Aldrin, and thought Lovell deserved his own command.

Early versions of the EVA checklist had the Lunar Module Pilot as the first to step onto the lunar surface. However, when Aldrin learned that this might be amended, he lobbied within NASA for the original procedure to be followed. Multiple factors contributed to the final decision, including the physical positioning of the astronauts within the compact lunar lander, which made it easier for Armstrong to be the first to exit the spacecraft. Furthermore, there was little support for Aldrin's views among senior astronauts who would command later Apollo missions. Collins has commented that he thought Aldrin "resents not being first on the Moon more than he appreciates being second".
Aldrin and Armstrong did not have time to perform much geological training. The first lunar landing focused more on landing on the Moon and making it safely back to Earth than the scientific aspects of the mission. The duo were briefed by NASA and <a href="USGS">USGS</a> geologists. They made one geological field trip to west Texas. The press followed them, and a helicopter made it hard for Aldrin and Armstrong to hear their instructor.

An estimated one million spectators watched the launch of Apollo 11 from the highways and beaches in the vicinity of the launch site. The launch was televised live in 33 countries, with an estimated 25 million viewers in the United States alone. Millions more listened to radio broadcasts. Propelled by a <a href="Saturn%20V">Saturn V</a> rocket, Apollo 11 lifted off from <a href="Launch%20Complex%2039">Launch Complex 39</a> at the <a href="Kennedy%20Space%20Center">Kennedy Space Center</a> on July 16, 1969, at 13:32:00 <a href="UTC">UTC</a> (9:32:00 <a href="Eastern%20Daylight%20Time">EDT</a>), and entered Earth orbit twelve minutes later. After one and a half orbits, the <a href="S-IVB">S-IVB</a> third-stage engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the Moon. About 30 minutes later, the <a href="transposition%2C%20docking%2C%20and%20extraction">transposition, docking, and extraction</a> maneuver was performed: this involved separating the <a href="Apollo%20command%20module">command module</a> "Columbia" from the spent S-IVB stage, turning around, and docking with <a href="lunar%20module">lunar module</a> "Eagle". After the lunar module was extracted, the combined spacecraft headed for the Moon, while the rocket stage flew on a trajectory past the Moon.
On July 19 at 17:21:50 UTC, Apollo 11 passed behind the Moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter <a href="lunar%20orbit">lunar orbit</a>. In the thirty orbits that followed, the crew saw passing views of their landing site in the southern <a href="Sea%20of%20Tranquillity">Sea of Tranquillity</a> about southwest of the crater <a href="Collins%20%28crater%29">Sabine D</a>. At 12:52:00 UTC on July 20, Aldrin and Armstrong entered "Eagle", and began the final preparations for lunar descent. At 17:44:00 "Eagle" separated from the "Columbia". Collins, alone aboard "Columbia", inspected "Eagle" as it pirouetted before him to check the craft was not damaged and that the landing gear was correctly deployed.

Throughout the descent, Aldrin called out navigation data to Armstrong, who was busy piloting the "Eagle". Five minutes into the descent burn, and above the surface of the Moon, the <a href="Apollo%20Guidance%20Computer">LM guidance computer</a> (LGC) distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected alarms that indicated that it could not complete all of its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them. The "Eagle" landed at 20:17:40 UTC on Sunday July 20 with about 25 seconds of fuel left.

Aldrin, a <a href="Elder%20%28Presbyterian%29">Presbyterian elder</a>, was the first and only person to hold a religious ceremony on the Moon. He radioed Earth: "I'd like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours, and to give thanks in his or her own way." Using a kit given to him by his pastor, he took <a href="Eucharist">communion</a>, but he kept it secret because of a lawsuit over the <a href="Apollo%208%20Genesis%20reading">reading of Genesis on Apollo 8</a>. In 1970 he commented: "It was interesting to think that the very first liquid ever poured on the Moon, and the first food eaten there, were communion elements." On reflection in his 2009 book, Aldrin felt that "Perhaps, if I had it to do over again, I would not choose to celebrate communion. Although it was a deeply meaningful experience for me, it was a Christian sacrament, and we had come to the Moon in the name of all mankind – be they Christians, Jews, Muslims, animists, agnostics, or atheists. But at the time I could think of no better way to acknowledge the enormity of the Apollo 11 experience than by giving thanks to God."

Preparations for the EVA began at 23:43. Once Armstrong and Aldrin were ready to go outside, "Eagle" was depressurized, and the hatch was opened at 02:39:33 on July 21. Aldrin set foot on the Moon at 03:15:16 on July 21, 1969 (UTC), nine minutes after Armstrong first touched the surface. Armstrong and Aldrin became the first and second people, respectively, to walk on the Moon. Aldrin's first words after he set foot on the Moon were "Beautiful view", to which Armstrong asked "Isn't that something? Magnificent sight out here." Aldrin answered, "Magnificent desolation." Aldrin and Armstrong had trouble erecting the <a href="Lunar%20Flag%20Assembly">Lunar Flag Assembly</a>, but with some effort secured it into the surface. Aldrin saluted the flag and Armstrong took an iconic photo of the scene. Aldrin positioned himself in front of the video camera and began experimenting with different locomotion methods to move about the lunar surface to aid future moonwalkers. During his experiments, President Nixon called the duo to congratulate them on the successful landing. Nixon closed with, "Thank you very much, and all of us look forward to seeing you on the "Hornet" on Thursday." Aldrin replied, "I look forward to that very much, sir."

After the call, Aldrin began photographing and inspecting the spacecraft to document and verify its condition before their flight. Aldrin and Armstrong then set up a seismometer to detect moonquakes and a laser beam reflector. While Armstrong inspected a crater, Aldrin began the difficult task of hammering a metal tube into the surface to obtain a core sample.

Most of the iconic photographs of an astronaut on the Moon taken by the Apollo 11 astronauts are of Aldrin; Armstrong appears in just two color photographs. "As the sequence of lunar operations evolved," Aldrin explained, "Neil had the camera most of the time, and the majority of the pictures taken on the Moon that include an astronaut are of me. It wasn't until we were back on Earth and in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory looking over the pictures that we realized there were few pictures of Neil. My fault perhaps, but we had never simulated this during our training."

Aldrin reentered "Eagle" first. With some difficulty they lifted film and two sample boxes containing of lunar surface material to the hatch using a flat cable pulley device. Armstrong reminded Aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his sleeve pocket, and Aldrin tossed the bag down. It contained a mission patch for the <a href="Apollo%201">Apollo 1</a> flight that Ed White never flew due to his death in a cabin fire during the launch rehearsal; medallions commemorating <a href="Yuri%20Gagarin">Yuri Gagarin</a>, the first man in space, and <a href="Vladimir%20Komarov">Vladimir Komarov</a>, the first man to die in a space flight, and a silicon disk etched with goodwill messages from 73 nations. After transferring to LM <a href="life%20support">life support</a>, the explorers lightened the ascent stage for the return to lunar orbit by tossing out their backpacks, lunar overshoes, an empty <a href="Hasselblad">Hasselblad</a> camera, and other equipment. The hatch was closed again at 05:01, and they repressurized the lunar module and settled down to sleep.

At 17:54 UTC, they lifted off in "Eagle" ascent stage to rejoin Collins aboard "Columbia" in lunar orbit. After rendezvous with "Columbia", the ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit, and "Columbia" made its way back to Earth. It splashed down in the Pacific east of <a href="Wake%20Island">Wake Island</a> at 16:50 UTC (05:50 local time) on July 24. The total mission duration was 195 hours, 18 minutes, 35 seconds.

The chance of bringing back <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>s from the lunar surface was considered a remote possibility, so divers passed biological isolation garments (BIGs) to the astronauts, and assisted them into the life raft. The astronauts were winched on board the recovery helicopter, and flown to the aircraft carrier , where they spent the first part of the Earth-based portion of 21 days of quarantine. On August 13, the three astronauts rode in ticker-tape parades in their honor in New York and Chicago, attended by an estimated six million people. An official <a href="state%20dinner">state dinner</a> that evening in Los Angeles celebrated the flight. President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> honored each of them with a presentation of the highest award a civilian can receive, the <a href="Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a>.

On September 16, 1969, the astronauts addressed a <a href="joint%20session%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Congress">joint session of Congress</a> where they thanked the representatives for their past support and implored them to continue funding the space effort. The astronauts embarked on a 38-day world tour on September 29 that brought the astronauts to 22 foreign countries and included visits with leaders of multiple countries. The last leg of the tour included Australia, Korea, and Japan; the crew returned to the US on November 5, 1969.
After Apollo 11, Aldrin was kept busy giving speeches and making public appearances. In October 1970, he joined Soviet cosmonauts <a href="Andriyan%20Nikolayev">Andriyan Nikolayev</a> and <a href="Vitaly%20Sevastyanov">Vitaly Sevastyanov</a> on their tour of the NASA space centers. He was also involved in the design of the <a href="Space%20Shuttle">Space Shuttle</a>. With the Apollo program coming to an end, Aldrin, now a <a href="colonel%20%28United%20States%29">colonel</a>, saw few prospects at NASA, and decided to return to the Air Force on July 1, 1971. During his NASA career, he had spent 289 hours and 53 minutes in space, of which 7 hours and 52 minutes was in EVA.

Aldrin hoped to become Commandant of Cadets at the United States Air Force Academy, however this job was given to his West Point classmate <a href="Hoyt%20S.%20Vandenberg%20Jr.">Hoyt S. Vandenberg Jr.</a> Aldrin was assigned as Commandant of the <a href="U.S.%20Air%20Force%20Test%20Pilot%20School">USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School</a> at <a href="Edwards%20Air%20Force%20Base">Edwards Air Force Base</a>, California. Aldrin had neither managerial nor test pilot experience, but a third of the training curriculum was devoted to astronaut training and students flew a modified <a href="Lockheed%20NF-104A">F-104 Starfighter</a> to the edge of space. Fellow Group 3 astronaut and moonwalker <a href="Alan%20Bean">Alan Bean</a> considered him well-qualified for the job.

Aldrin did not get along well with his superior, Brigadier General <a href="Robert%20M.%20White">Robert M. White</a>, who had earned his USAF <a href="United%20States%20Astronaut%20Badge">astronaut wings</a> flying the <a href="X-15">X-15</a>. Aldrin's celebrity status led people to defer to him more than the higher-ranking general. There were two crashes at Edwards, of an <a href="A-7%20Corsair%20II">A-7 Corsair II</a> and a <a href="T-33">T-33</a>. No lives were lost, but the aircraft were destroyed and the accidents were attributed to insufficient supervision, which placed the blame on Aldrin. What he had hoped would be an enjoyable job became a highly stressful one.

Aldrin went to see the base surgeon. In addition to signs of <a href="Major%20depressive%20disorder">depression</a>, he experienced neck and shoulder pains, and hoped that the latter might explain the former. He was hospitalized for depression at <a href="Wilford%20Hall%20Medical%20Center">Wilford Hall Medical Center</a> for four weeks. His mother had committed suicide in May 1968, and he was plagued with guilt that his fame after Gemini 12 had contributed. His mother's father had also committed suicide, and he believed he inherited depression from them. At the time there was great stigma related to mental illness and he was aware that it could not only be career-ending, but could result in being ostracized socially.

In February 1972, <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="George%20S.%20Brown">George S. Brown</a> paid a visit to Edwards and informed Aldrin that the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School was being renamed the USAF Test Pilot School and the astronaut training was being dropped. With the Apollo program winding down, and Air Force budgets being cut, the Air Force's interest in space diminished. Aldrin elected to retire as a colonel on March 1, 1972, after 21 years of service. His father and General <a href="Jimmy%20Doolittle">Jimmy Doolittle</a>, a close friend of his father, attended the formal retirement ceremony.

Aldrin's father died on December 28, 1974, from complications following a <a href="heart%20attack">heart attack</a>. His autobiographies "Return to Earth," (1973) and "<a href="Magnificent%20Desolation%20%28book%29">Magnificent Desolation</a>" (2009), recounted Aldrin's struggles with <a href="clinical%20depression">clinical depression</a> and <a href="alcoholism">alcoholism</a> in the years after leaving NASA. He was reduced to selling used cars, at which he had no talent. Periods of hospitalization and sobriety alternated with bouts of heavy drinking. Eventually he was arrested for <a href="disorderly%20conduct">disorderly conduct</a>. Finally, in October 1978, he quit drinking for good. Aldrin attempted to help others with drinking problems, including actor <a href="William%20Holden">William Holden</a>. Holden's girlfriend <a href="Stefanie%20Powers">Stefanie Powers</a> had portrayed Marianne, a woman with whom Aldrin had an affair, in the <a href="Return%20to%20Earth%20%28film%29">TV movie version of "Return to Earth"</a>. Aldrin was saddened by Holden's alcohol-related death in 1981.

On September 9, 2002, Aldrin was lured to a <a href="Beverly%20Hills%2C%20California">Beverly Hills</a> hotel on the pretext of being interviewed for a Japanese children's television show on the subject of space. When he arrived, <a href="Moon%20landing%20conspiracy%20theories">Moon landing conspiracy theorist</a> <a href="Bart%20Sibrel">Bart Sibrel</a> accosted him with a film crew and demanded he swear on a Bible that the Moon landings were not faked. After a brief confrontation, during which Sibrel followed Aldrin despite being told to leave him alone, and called him "thief, liar and coward", the 72-year-old Aldrin punched Sibrel in the jaw, which was caught on camera by Sibrel's film crew. Aldrin stated that he had acted to defend himself and his stepdaughter. Witnesses stated that Sibrel had aggressively poked Aldrin with a Bible. Additional mitigating factors were that Sibrel sustained no visible injury and did not seek medical attention, and that Aldrin had no criminal record. The police declined to press charges against Aldrin.

In 2005, while being interviewed for a <a href="Science%20Channel">Science Channel</a> documentary titled "First on the Moon: The Untold Story", Aldrin told an interviewer that they saw an <a href="unidentified%20flying%20object">unidentified flying object</a>. The documentary makers omitted the crew's conclusion that they probably saw one of the four detached spacecraft adapter panels from the upper stage of the Saturn V rocket. The panels had been jettisoned before the separation maneuver so they closely followed the spacecraft until the first mid-course correction. When Aldrin appeared on "<a href="The%20Howard%20Stern%20Show">The Howard Stern Show</a>" on August 15, 2007, Stern asked him about the supposed UFO sighting. Aldrin confirmed that there was no such sighting of anything deemed extraterrestrial and said they were, and are, "99.9 percent" sure that the object was the detached panel. According to Aldrin his words had been taken out of context. He made a request to the Science Channel to make a correction, but was refused.

In December 2016, Aldrin was part of a tourist group visiting the <a href="Amundsen%E2%80%93Scott%20South%20Pole%20Station">Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station</a> in <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> when he fell ill and was evacuated, first to <a href="McMurdo%20Station">McMurdo Station</a> and from there to <a href="Christchurch">Christchurch</a>, New Zealand. At 86 years of age, Aldrin's visit made him the oldest person to reach the South Pole. He had traveled to the North Pole in 1998.

After leaving NASA, Aldrin continued to advocate for space exploration. In 1985 he joined the <a href="University%20of%20North%20Dakota">University of North Dakota</a> (UND)'s <a href="John%20D.%20Odegard%20School%20of%20Aerospace%20Sciences">College of Aerospace Sciences</a> at the invitation of John D. Odegard, the dean of the college. Aldrin helped to develop UND's Space Studies program and brought Dr. <a href="David%20C.%20Webb">David Webb</a> from NASA to serve as the department's first chair. To further promote space exploration, and to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the first lunar landing, Aldrin teamed up with <a href="Snoop%20Dogg">Snoop Dogg</a>, <a href="Quincy%20Jones">Quincy Jones</a>, <a href="Talib%20Kweli">Talib Kweli</a>, and <a href="Soulja%20Boy">Soulja Boy</a> to create the rap single and video "Rocket Experience", proceeds from which were donated to Aldrin's non-profit foundation, <a href="ShareSpace%20foundation">ShareSpace</a>.

In 1985, Aldrin proposed a special spacecraft <a href="trajectory">trajectory</a> now known as the <a href="Aldrin%20cycler">Aldrin cycler</a>. Cycler trajectories offer reduced cost of repeated travel to Mars by using less propellant. The Aldrin cycler provided a five and a half month journey from the Earth to Mars, with a return trip to Earth of the same duration on a twin cycler orbit. Aldrin continues to research this concept with engineers from Purdue University.

In December 2003, Aldrin published an opinion piece in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" criticizing NASA's objectives. In it, he voiced concern about NASA's development of a <a href="Orion%20%28spacecraft%29">spacecraft</a> "limited to transporting four astronauts at a time with little or no cargo carrying capability" and declared the goal of sending astronauts back to the Moon was "more like reaching for past glory than striving for new triumphs".

In a June 2013 opinion piece in "The New York Times", Aldrin supported a <a href="human%20mission%20to%20Mars">human mission to Mars</a> and which viewed the Moon "not as a destination but more a point of departure, one that places humankind on a trajectory to homestead Mars and become a two-planet species." In August 2015, Aldrin, in association with the <a href="Florida%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Florida Institute of Technology</a>, presented a master plan to NASA for consideration where astronauts, with a tour of duty of ten years, establish a colony on Mars before the year 2040.

Aldrin was awarded the <a href="Air%20Force%20Distinguished%20Service%20Medal">Air Force Distinguished Service Medal</a> (DSM) in 1969 for his role as lunar module pilot on Apollo 11. He was awarded an <a href="oak%20leaf%20cluster">oak leaf cluster</a> in 1972 in lieu of a second DSM for his role in both the Korean War and in the space program, and the <a href="Legion%20of%20Merit">Legion of Merit</a> for his role in the Gemini and Apollo programs. During a 1966 ceremony marking the end of the Gemini program, Aldrin was awarded the <a href="NASA%20Exceptional%20Service%20Medal">NASA Exceptional Service Medal</a> by <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">President Johnson</a> at LBJ Ranch. He was awarded the <a href="NASA%20Distinguished%20Service%20Medal">NASA Distinguished Service Medal</a> in 1970 for the Apollo 11 mission. Aldrin was one of ten Gemini astronauts inducted into the <a href="New%20Mexico%20Museum%20of%20Space%20History">International Space Hall of Fame</a> in 1982. He was also inducted into the <a href="U.S.%20Astronaut%20Hall%20of%20Fame">U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame</a> in 1993, the <a href="National%20Aviation%20Hall%20of%20Fame">National Aviation Hall of Fame</a> in 2000, and the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">New Jersey Hall of Fame</a> in 2008.
In 1999, while celebrating the 30th anniversary of the lunar landing, Vice-President <a href="Al%20Gore">Al Gore</a>, who was also the vice-chancellor of the Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents, presented the Apollo 11 crew with the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>'s <a href="Langley%20Gold%20Medal">Langley Gold Medal</a> for aviation. After the ceremony, the crew went to the White House and presented President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> with an encased Moon rock. The Apollo 11 crew was awarded the New Frontier <a href="Congressional%20Gold%20Medal">Congressional Gold Medal</a> in the Capitol Rotunda in 2011. During the ceremony, NASA administrator <a href="Charles%20Bolden">Charles Bolden</a> said, "Those of us who have had the privilege to fly in space followed the trail they forged."

The Apollo 11 crew were awarded the <a href="Collier%20Trophy">Collier Trophy</a> in 1969. The National Aeronautic Association president awarded a duplicate trophy to Collins and Aldrin at a ceremony. The crew was awarded the 1969 General Thomas D. White USAF Space Trophy. The National Space Club named the crew the winners of the 1970 <a href="Dr.%20Robert%20H.%20Goddard%20Memorial%20Trophy">Dr. Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy</a>, awarded annually for the greatest achievement in spaceflight. They received the international <a href="Harmon%20Trophy">Harmon Trophy</a> for aviators in 1970, conferred to them by Vice-President <a href="Spiro%20Agnew">Spiro Agnew</a> in 1971. Agnew also presented them the <a href="Hubbard%20Medal">Hubbard Medal</a> of the National Geographic Society in 1970. He told them, "You've won a place alongside Christopher Columbus in American history". In 1970, the Apollo 11 team were co-winners of the <a href="Iven%20C.%20Kincheloe">Iven C. Kincheloe</a> award from the <a href="Society%20of%20Experimental%20Test%20Pilots">Society of Experimental Test Pilots</a> along with <a href="Darryl%20Greenamyer">Darryl Greenamyer</a> who broke the world speed record for piston engine airplanes. For contributions to the television industry, they were honored with round plaques on the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a>.

In 2001, President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> appointed Aldrin to the <a href="Commission%20on%20the%20Future%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Aerospace%20Industry">Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry</a>. Aldrin received the 2003 Humanitarian Award from <a href="Variety%2C%20the%20Children%27s%20Charity">Variety, the Children's Charity</a>, which, according to the organization, "is given to an individual who has shown unusual understanding, empathy, and devotion to mankind." In 2006, the <a href="Space%20Foundation">Space Foundation</a> awarded him its highest honor, the General <a href="James%20E.%20Hill">James E. Hill</a> Lifetime Space Achievement Award.

Aldrin received honorary degrees from six colleges and universities, and was named as the Chancellor of the <a href="International%20Space%20University">International Space University</a> in 2015. He was a member of the <a href="National%20Space%20Society">National Space Society</a>'s Board of Governors, and has served as the organization's chairman. In 2016, his hometown middle school in Montclair, New Jersey, was renamed Buzz Aldrin Middle School. The <a href="Aldrin%20%28crater%29">Aldrin crater</a> on the Moon near the Apollo 11 landing site and Asteroid <a href="6470%20Aldrin">6470 Aldrin</a> are named in his honor.

Aldrin has been married three times. His first marriage was on December 29, 1954, to Joan Archer, a <a href="Rutgers%20University">Rutgers University</a> and <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a> alumna with a master's degree. They had three children, James, Janice and Andrew. They filed for divorce in 1974. His second was to Beverly Van Zile, whom he married on December 31, 1975, and divorced in 1978. His third was to Lois Driggs Cannon, whom he married on February 14, 1988. Their divorce was finalized in December 2012. The settlement included 50 percent of their $475,000 bank account, and $9,500 a month plus 30 percent of his annual income, estimated at more than $600,000. As of 2017, he has one grandson, Jeffrey Schuss, born to his daughter Janice, and three great-grandsons.

In 2018 Aldrin was involved in a legal dispute with his children Andrew and Janice and former business manager Christina Korp over their claims that he was mentally impaired through <a href="dementia">dementia</a> and <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a>. His children alleged that he made new friends that were alienating him from the family and encouraging him to spend his savings at a high rate. They sought to be named legal guardians so they could control his finances. In June, Aldrin filed a lawsuit against Andrew, Janice, Korp, and businesses and foundations run by the family. Aldrin alleged that Janice was not acting in his financial interests and that Korp was exploiting the elderly. He sought to remove Andrew's control of Aldrin's social media accounts, finances, and businesses. The situation ended when his children withdrew their petition and he dropped the lawsuit in March 2019, just before the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission.

Aldrin is an active supporter of the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a>, headlining fundraisers for its members of <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> and endorsing its candidates. He appeared at a rally for George W. Bush in 2004 and campaigned for <a href="Nick%20Lampson">Nick Lampson</a> in Texas in 2006, Paul Rancatore in Florida in 2008, Mark Treadwell in Alaska in 2014 and <a href="Dan%20Crenshaw">Dan Crenshaw</a> in Texas in 2018. He appeared at the <a href="2019%20State%20of%20the%20Union%20Address">2019 State of the Union Address</a> as a guest of President <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a>.

Following the 2012 death of his Apollo 11 colleague, Neil Armstrong, Aldrin said that he was "deeply saddened by the passing... I know I am joined by many millions of others from around the world in mourning the passing of a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew... I had truly hoped that on July 20th, 2019, Neil, Mike and I would be standing together to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of our moon landing."

In 2007, he confirmed to "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine that he had recently had a <a href="face-lift">face-lift</a>, joking that the <a href="g-force">g-force</a>s he was exposed to in space "caused a sagging jowl that needed some attention." He primarily resided in the Los Angeles area, including Beverly Hills and <a href="Laguna%20Beach%2C%20California">Laguna Beach</a> and <a href="Emerald%20Bay%2C%20Orange%20County%2C%20California">Emerald Bay</a>.

Barn swallow

The barn swallow ("Hirundo rustica") is the most widespread species of <a href="swallow">swallow</a> in the world. It is a distinctive <a href="passerine">passerine</a> bird with blue upperparts and a long, deeply forked <a href="tail">tail</a>. It is found in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. In <a href="English-speaking%20world">Anglophone</a> Europe it is just called the swallow; in Northern Europe it is the only common species called a "<a href="swallow">swallow</a>" rather than a "<a href="Martin%20%28bird%29">martin</a>".

There are six subspecies of barn swallow, which breed across the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>. Four are strongly <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a>, and their wintering grounds cover much of the <a href="Southern%20Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a> as far south as central <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, the <a href="Cape%20Province">Cape Province</a> of South Africa, and northern Australia. Its huge range means that the barn swallow is not endangered, although there may be local population declines due to specific threats.

The barn swallow is a bird of open country that normally uses man-made structures to breed and consequently has spread with human expansion. It builds a cup <a href="bird%20nest">nest</a> from mud pellets in barns or similar structures and feeds on insects caught in flight. This species lives in close association with humans, and its insect-eating habits mean that it is tolerated by humans; this acceptance was reinforced in the past by superstitions regarding the bird and its nest. There are frequent cultural references to the barn swallow in literary and religious works due to both its living in close proximity to humans and its annual migration. The barn swallow is the <a href="list%20of%20national%20birds">national bird</a> of <a href="Estonia">Estonia</a>.

The adult male barn swallow of the nominate subspecies "H. r. rustica" is long including of elongated outer tail feathers. It has a wingspan of and weighs . It has steel blue upperparts and a <a href="rufous">rufous</a> forehead, chin and throat, which are separated from the off-white underparts by a broad dark blue breast band. The outer tail feathers are elongated, giving the distinctive deeply forked "swallow tail". There is a line of white spots across the outer end of the upper tail. The female is similar in appearance to the male, but the tail streamers are shorter, the blue of the upperparts and breast band is less glossy, and the underparts paler. The juvenile is browner and has a paler rufous face and whiter underparts. It also lacks the long tail streamers of the adult.
The song of the barn swallow is a cheerful warble, often ending with "su-seer" with the second note higher than the first but falling in pitch. Calls include "witt" or "witt-witt" and a loud "splee-plink" when excited (or trying to chase intruders away from the nest). The <a href="alarm%20call">alarm call</a>s include a sharp "siflitt" for predators like cats and a "flitt-flitt" for <a href="bird%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a> like the <a href="Hobby%20%28bird%29">hobby</a>. This species is fairly quiet on the wintering grounds.
The distinctive combination of a red face and blue breast band render the adult barn swallow easy to distinguish from the African "Hirundo" species and from the <a href="welcome%20swallow">welcome swallow</a> ("Hirundo neoxena") with which its range overlaps in <a href="Australasia">Australasia</a>. In Africa the short tail streamers of the juvenile barn swallow invite confusion with juvenile <a href="red-chested%20swallow">red-chested swallow</a> ("Hirundo lucida"), but the latter has a narrower breast band and more white in the tail.

The barn swallow was described by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in his "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>" in 1758 as "Hirundo rustica", characterised as "H. rectricibus, exceptis duabus intermediis, macula alba notatîs". "Hirundo" is the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word for "swallow"; "rusticus" means "of the country". This species is the only one of that genus to have a range extending into the Americas, with the majority of "Hirundo" species being native to Africa. This genus of blue-backed swallows is sometimes called the "barn swallows".

The "<a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>" dates the English <a href="common%20name">common name</a> "barn swallow" to 1851, though an earlier instance of the <a href="collocation">collocation</a> in an English-language context is in Gilbert White's popular book "<a href="The%20Natural%20History%20and%20Antiquities%20of%20Selborne">The Natural History of Selborne</a>", originally published in 1789:

The swallow, though called the chimney-swallow, by no means builds altogether in chimnies , but often within barns and out-houses against the rafters ... In "Sweden" she builds in barns, and is called "ladusvala", the barn-swallow.

This suggests that the English name may be a <a href="calque">calque</a> on the Swedish term.

There are few <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> problems within the genus, but the red-chested swallow—a resident of West Africa, the <a href="Congo%20River">Congo basin</a>, and <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>—was formerly treated as a subspecies of barn swallow. The red-chested swallow is slightly smaller than its migratory relative, has a narrower blue breast-band, and (in the adult) has shorter tail streamers. In <a href="bird%20flight">flight</a>, it looks paler underneath than barn swallow.

Six subspecies of barn swallow are generally recognised. In eastern Asia, a number of additional or alternative forms have been proposed, including "saturata" by <a href="Robert%20Ridgway">Robert Ridgway</a> in 1883, "kamtschatica" by <a href="Benedykt%20Dybowski">Benedykt Dybowski</a> in 1883, "ambigua" by <a href="Erwin%20Stresemann">Erwin Stresemann</a> and "mandschurica" by <a href="Wilhelm%20Meise">Wilhelm Meise</a> in 1934. Given the uncertainties over the validity of these forms, this article follows the treatment of Turner and Rose.


The short wings, red belly and incomplete breast band of "H. r. tytleri" are also found in "H. r. erythrogaster", and <a href="DNA">DNA</a> analyses show that barn swallows from North America colonised the <a href="Lake%20Baikal">Baikal</a> region of Siberia, a dispersal direction opposite to that for most changes in distribution between North America and Eurasia.

The preferred habitat of the barn swallow is open country with low vegetation, such as pasture, meadows and farmland, preferably with nearby water. This swallow avoids heavily wooded or precipitous areas and densely built-up locations. The presence of accessible open structures such as barns, stables, or culverts to provide nesting sites, and exposed locations such as wires, roof ridges or bare branches for perching, are also important in the bird's selection of its breeding range.

It breeds in the Northern Hemisphere from sea level to typically , but to in the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a> and North America, and it is absent only from deserts and the cold northernmost parts of the continents. Over much of its range, it avoids towns, and in Europe is replaced in urban areas by the <a href="Common%20house%20martin">house martin</a>. However, in <a href="Honsh%C5%AB">Honshū</a>, <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, the barn swallow is a more urban bird, with the <a href="red-rumped%20swallow">red-rumped swallow</a> ("Cecropis daurica") replacing it as the rural species.

In winter, the barn swallow is cosmopolitan in its choice of habitat, avoiding only dense forests and deserts. It is most common in open, low vegetation habitats, such as <a href="savanna">savanna</a> and ranch land, and in <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>, South Africa and <a href="Trinidad%20and%20Tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</a> it is described as being particularly attracted to burnt or harvested <a href="sugarcane">sugarcane</a> fields and the waste from the cane. In the absence of suitable roost sites, they may sometimes roost on wires where they are more exposed to predators. Individual birds tend to return to the same wintering locality each year and congregate from a large area to <a href="communal%20roosting">roost</a> in reed beds. These roosts can be extremely large; one in Nigeria had an estimated 1.5 million birds. These roosts are thought to be a protection from predators, and the arrival of roosting birds is synchronised in order to overwhelm predators like <a href="African%20hobby">African hobbies</a>. The barn swallow has been recorded as breeding in the more temperate parts of its winter range, such as the mountains of <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a> and in central Argentina.

Migration of barn swallows between Britain and South Africa was first established on 23 December 1912 when a bird that had been ringed by James Masefield at a nest in Staffordshire, was found in Natal. As would be expected for a long-distance migrant, this bird has occurred as a vagrant to such distant areas as Hawaii, <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>, Greenland, <a href="Tristan%20da%20Cunha">Tristan da Cunha</a> the <a href="Falkland%20Islands">Falkland Islands</a>, and even Antarctica.

The barn swallow is similar in its habits to other aerial <a href="insectivore">insectivore</a>s, including other swallow species and the unrelated <a href="swift">swift</a>s. It is not a particularly fast flier, with a speed estimated at about 11 <a href="metre%20per%20second">m/s</a>, up to 20 <a href="metre%20per%20second">m/s</a> and a wing beat rate of approximately 5, up to 7–9 times each second.

The barn swallow typically feeds in open areas above shallow water or the ground often following animals, humans or farm machinery to catch disturbed insects, but it will occasionally pick prey items from the water surface, walls and plants. In the breeding areas, large <a href="fly">flies</a> make up around 70% of the diet, with <a href="aphid">aphid</a>s also a significant component. However, in Europe, the barn swallow consumes fewer aphids than the <a href="Common%20house%20martin">house</a> or <a href="sand%20martin">sand martin</a>s. On the wintering grounds, <a href="Hymenoptera">Hymenoptera</a>, especially flying <a href="ant">ant</a>s, are important food items. When egg-laying, barn swallows hunt in pairs, but will form often <a href="Group%20size%20measures">large flocks</a> otherwise.

The amount of food a clutch will get depends on the size of the clutch, with larger clutches getting more food on average. The timing of a clutch also determines the food given; later broods get food that is smaller in size compared to earlier broods. This is because larger insects are too far away from the nest to be profitable in terms of energy expenditure.

<a href="Isotope">Isotope</a> studies have shown that wintering populations may utilise different feeding habitats, with British breeders feeding mostly over grassland, whereas <a href="Switzerland">Swiss</a> birds utilised woodland more. Another study showed that a single population breeding in <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a> actually wintered in two separate and different areas.

The barn swallow drinks by skimming low over lakes or rivers and scooping up water with its open mouth. This bird bathes in a similar fashion, dipping into the water for an instant while in flight.

Swallows gather in communal roosts after breeding, sometimes thousands strong. Reed beds are regularly favoured, with the birds swirling "en masse" before swooping low over the reeds. Reed beds are an important source of food prior to and whilst on migration; although the barn swallow is a diurnal migrant that can feed on the wing whilst it travels low over ground or water, the reed beds enable fat deposits to be established or replenished.

The male barn swallow returns to the breeding grounds before the females and selects a nest site, which is then advertised to females with a circling flight and song. Plumage may be used to advertise: in some populations, like in the subspecies "H. r. gutturalis", darker ventral plumage in males is associated with higher breeding success. In other populations, the breeding success of the male is related to the length of the tail streamers, with longer streamers being more attractive to the female. Males with longer tail feathers are generally longer-lived and more disease resistant, females thus gaining an indirect fitness benefit from this form of selection, since longer tail feathers indicate a genetically stronger individual which will produce offspring with enhanced vitality. Males in northern Europe have longer tails than those further south; whereas in Spain the male's tail streamers are only 5% longer than the female's, in Finland the difference is 20%. In Denmark, the average male tail length increased by 9% between 1984 and 2004, but it is possible that climatic changes may lead in the future to shorter tails if summers become hot and dry.

Males with long streamers also have larger white tail spots, and since feather-eating <a href="chewing%20louse">bird lice</a> prefer white feathers, large white tail spots without <a href="Parasitism">parasite</a> damage again demonstrate breeding quality; there is a positive association between spot size and the number of offspring produced each season.

The breeding season of the barn swallow is variable; in the southern part of the range, the breeding season usually is from February or March to early to mid September, although some late second and third broods finish in October. In the northern part of the range, it usually starts late May to early June and ends the same time as the breeding season of the southernmost birds.

Both sexes defend the nest, but the male is particularly aggressive and territorial. Once established, pairs stay together to breed for life, but extra-pair <a href="Mating">copulation</a> is common, making this species <a href="gene">gene</a>tically <a href="polygamy">polygamous</a>, despite being socially <a href="monogamy">monogamous</a>. Males guard females actively to avoid being <a href="cuckold">cuckold</a>ed. Males may use deceptive alarm calls to disrupt extrapair copulation attempts toward their mates.

As its name implies, the barn swallow typically nests inside accessible buildings such as barns and stables, or under bridges and wharves. Before man-made sites became common, it nested on cliff faces or in caves, but this is now rare. The neat cup-shaped nest is placed on a beam or against a suitable vertical projection. It is constructed by both sexes, although more often by the female, with mud pellets collected in their beaks and lined with grasses, feathers, algae or other soft materials. The nest building ability of the male is also sexually selected; females will lay more eggs and at an earlier date with males who are better at nest construction, with the opposite being true with males that are not. After building the nest, barn swallows may nest colonially where sufficient high-quality nest sites are available, and within a colony, each pair defends a territory around the nest which, for the European subspecies, is in size. <a href="Group%20size%20measures">Colony size</a> tends to be larger in North America.

In North America at least, barn swallows frequently engage in a <a href="Mutualism%20%28biology%29">mutualist</a> relationship with <a href="osprey">osprey</a>s. Barn swallows will build their nest below an osprey nest, receiving protection from other birds of prey that are repelled by the exclusively fish-eating ospreys. The ospreys are alerted to the presence of these predators by the alarm calls of the swallows.

There are normally two broods, with the original nest being reused for the second brood and being repaired and reused in subsequent years. The female lays two to seven, but typically four or five, reddish-spotted white eggs. The clutch size is influenced by latitude, with clutch sizes of northern populations being higher on average than southern populations. The eggs are in size, and weigh , of which 5% is shell. In Europe, the female does almost all the <a href="avian%20incubation">incubation</a>, but in North America the male may incubate up to 25% of the time. The incubation period is normally 14–19 days, with another 18–23 days before the <a href="altricial">altricial</a> chicks fledge. The fledged young stay with, and are fed by, the parents for about a week after leaving the nest. Occasionally, first-year birds from the first brood will assist in feeding the second brood. Compared to those from early broods, juvenile barn swallows from late broods have been found to migrate at a younger age, fuel less efficiently during migration and have lower return rates the following year.

The barn swallow will <a href="mobbing%20behavior">mob</a> intruders such as cats or <a href="accipiter">accipiter</a>s that venture too close to their nest, often flying very close to the threat. Adult barn swallows have few predators, but some are taken by accipiters, <a href="falcon">falcon</a>s, and <a href="owl">owl</a>s. <a href="Brood%20parasite">Brood parasitism</a> by <a href="cowbird">cowbird</a>s in North America or <a href="cuckoo">cuckoo</a>s in Eurasia is rare.

Hatching success is 90% and the fledging survival rate is 70–90%. Average mortality is 70–80% in the first year and 40–70% for the adult. Although the record age is more than 11 years, most survive less than four years. Barn swallow nestlings have prominent red gapes, a feature shown to induce feeding by parent birds. An experiment in manipulating brood size and immune system showed the vividness of the gape was positively correlated with T-cell–mediated immunocompetence, and that larger brood size and injection with an antigen led to a less vivid gape.

The barn swallow has been recorded as <a href="hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridising</a> with the <a href="American%20cliff%20swallow">cliff swallow</a> ("Petrochelidon pyrrhonota") and the <a href="cave%20swallow">cave swallow</a> ("P. fulva") in North America, and the house martin ("Delichon urbicum") in Eurasia, the cross with the latter being one of the most common passerine hybrids.
Barn swallows (and other small <a href="passerines">passerines</a>) often have characteristic <a href="feather%20holes">feather holes</a> on their wing and tail feathers. These holes were suggested as being caused by <a href="Phthiraptera">avian lice</a> such as "<a href="Machaerilaemus%20malleus">Machaerilaemus malleus</a>" and "<a href="Myrsidea%20rustica">Myrsidea rustica</a>", although other studies suggest that they are mainly caused by species of "<a href="Brueelia">Brueelia</a>". Several other species of lice have been described from barn swallow hosts, including "Brueelia domestica" and "Philopterus microsomaticus". The avian lice prefer to feed on white tail spots, and they are generally found more numerously on short-tailed males, indicating the function of unbroken white tail spots as a measure of quality. In Texas, the swallow bug ("<a href="Oeciacus%20vicarius">Oeciacus vicarius</a>"), which is common on species such as the <a href="cliff%20swallow">cliff swallow</a>, is also known to infest barn swallows.

Predatory bats such as the <a href="greater%20false%20vampire%20bat">greater false vampire bat</a> are known to prey on barn swallows. Swallows at their communal roosts attract predators and several falcon species make use of these opportunities. Falcon species confirmed as predators include the <a href="peregrine%20falcon">peregrine falcon</a> and the <a href="African%20hobby">African hobby</a>.

The barn swallow has an enormous range, with an estimated global extent of and a population of 190 million individuals. The species is evaluated as <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> on the 2007 <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>, and has no special status under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (<a href="CITES">CITES</a>), which regulates international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants.

This is a species that has greatly benefited historically from forest clearance, which has created the open habitats it prefers, and from human habitation, which have given it an abundance of safe man-made nest sites. There have been local declines due to the use of <a href="DDT">DDT</a> in Israel in the 1950s, competition for nest sites with <a href="house%20sparrow">house sparrow</a>s in the US in the 19th century, and an ongoing gradual decline in numbers in parts of Europe and Asia due to agricultural intensification, reducing the availability of insect food. However, there has been an increase in the population in North America during the 20th century with the greater availability of nesting sites and subsequent range expansion, including the colonisation of northern <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>.

A specific threat to wintering birds from the European populations is the transformation by the South African government of a light aircraft runway near <a href="Durban">Durban</a> into <a href="King%20Shaka%20International%20Airport">an international airport</a> for the <a href="2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2010 FIFA World Cup</a>. The roughly square Mount Moreland reed bed is a night roost for more than three million barn swallows, which represent 1% of the global population and 8% of the European breeding population. The reed bed lies on the flight path of aircraft using the proposed La Mercy airport, and there were fears that it would be cleared because the birds could threaten aircraft safety. However, following detailed evaluation, advanced radar technology will be installed to enable planes using the airport to be warned of bird movements and, if necessary, take appropriate measures to avoid the flocks.

<a href="Climate%20change">Climate change</a> may affect the barn swallow; drought causes weight loss and slow feather regrowth, and the expansion of the <a href="Sahara">Sahara</a> will make it a more formidable obstacle for migrating European birds. Hot dry summers will reduce the availability of insect food for chicks. Conversely, warmer springs may lengthen the breeding season and result in more chicks, and the opportunity to use nest sites outside buildings in the north of the range might also lead to more offspring.

The barn swallow is an attractive bird that feeds on flying insects and has therefore been tolerated by humans when it shares their buildings for nesting. As one of the earlier migrants, this conspicuous species is also seen as an early sign of summer's approach.

In the <a href="Old%20World">Old World</a>, the barn swallow appears to have used man-made structures and bridges since time immemorial. An early reference is in <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>'s "<a href="Georgics">Georgics</a>" (29 BC), ""Ante garrula quam tignis nidum suspendat hirundo"" (Before the twittering swallow hangs its nest from the rafters).

Many cattle farmers believed that swallows spread "<a href="Salmonella">Salmonella</a>" infections, however a study in Sweden showed no evidence of the birds being reservoirs of the bacteria.

Many literary references are based on the barn swallow's northward migration as a symbol of spring or summer. The <a href="proverb">proverb</a> about the necessity for more than one piece of evidence goes back at least to <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>'s "<a href="Nicomachean%20Ethics">Nicomachean Ethics</a>": "For as one swallow or one day does not make a spring, so one day or a short time does not make a fortunate or happy man."

The barn swallow symbolises the coming of spring and thus love in the "<a href="Pervigilium%20Veneris">Pervigilium Veneris</a>", a late <a href="Latin">Latin</a> poem. In his poem "<a href="The%20Waste%20Land">The Waste Land</a>", <a href="T.%20S.%20Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a> quoted the line ""Quando fiam uti chelidon [ut tacere desinam]?"" ("When will I be like the swallow, so that I can stop being silent?") This refers to the myth of <a href="Philomela%20%28princess%20of%20Athens%29">Philomela</a> in which she turns into a <a href="nightingale">nightingale</a>, and her sister <a href="Procne">Procne</a> into a <a href="swallow">swallow</a>. On the other hand, an image of the assembly of swallows for their southward migration concludes <a href="John%20Keats">John Keats</a>'s ode "<a href="To%20Autumn">To Autumn</a>".

The swallow is cited in several of <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s plays for the swiftness of its flight, with "True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings" from Act 5 of "<a href="Richard%20III%20%28play%29">Richard III</a>", and "I have horse will follow where the game Makes way, and run like swallows o'er the plain." from the second act of "<a href="Titus%20Andronicus">Titus Andronicus</a>". Shakespeare references the annual migration of the species in "<a href="The%20Winter%27s%20Tale">The Winter's Tale</a>", Act 4: "Daffodils, That come before the swallow dares, and take The winds of March with beauty".

<a href="Gilbert%20White">Gilbert White</a> studied the barn swallow in detail in his pioneering work "<a href="The%20Natural%20History%20of%20Selborne">The Natural History of Selborne</a>", but even this careful observer was uncertain whether it migrated or hibernated in winter. Elsewhere, its long journeys have been well observed, and a <a href="swallow%20tattoo">swallow tattoo</a> is popular amongst nautical men as a symbol of a safe return; the tradition was that a mariner had a tattoo of this fellow wanderer after sailing . A second swallow would be added after at sea. In the past, the tolerance for this beneficial <a href="insectivore">insectivore</a> was reinforced by superstitions regarding damage to the barn swallow's nest. Such an act might lead to cows giving bloody milk, or no milk at all, or to hens ceasing to lay. This may be a factor in the longevity of swallows' nests. Survival, with suitable annual refurbishment, for 10–15 years is regular, and one nest was reported to have been occupied for 48 years.

It is depicted as the "Martlet", "Merlette" or "Merlot" in <a href="heraldry">heraldry</a>, where it represents younger sons who have no lands. It is also represented as lacking feet as this was a common belief at the time. As a result of a campaign by <a href="ornithology">ornithologists</a>, the barn swallow has been the national bird of <a href="Estonia">Estonia</a> since 23 June 1960.

Battle of Dien Bien Phu

The Battle of Dien Bien Phu ( ; , ) was the climactic confrontation of the <a href="First%20Indochina%20War">First Indochina War</a> between the <a href="French%20Union">French Union</a>'s <a href="French%20Far%20East%20Expeditionary%20Corps">French Far East Expeditionary Corps</a> and <a href="Viet%20Minh">Viet Minh</a> <a href="Communism">communist</a> <a href="Revolutionary">revolutionaries</a>. It was, from the French view before the event, a <a href="Pitched%20battle">set piece battle</a> to draw out the Vietnamese and destroy them with superior firepower. The battle occurred between March and May 1954 and culminated in a comprehensive French defeat that influenced negotiations underway at <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a> among several nations over the future of <a href="Indochina">Indochina</a>.

As a result of blunders in French decision-making, the French began an operation to insert, then support, the soldiers at <a href="%C4%90i%E1%BB%87n%20Bi%C3%AAn%20Ph%E1%BB%A7">Điện Biên Phủ</a>, deep in the hills of northwestern <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>. Its purpose was to cut off <a href="Viet%20Minh">Viet Minh</a> supply lines into the neighboring <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Laos">Kingdom of Laos</a>, a French ally, and tactically draw the Viet Minh into a major confrontation in order to cripple them. The plan was to resupply the French position by air, and was based on the belief that the Viet Minh had no anti-aircraft capability. The Viet Minh, however, under General <a href="V%C3%B5%20Nguy%C3%AAn%20Gi%C3%A1p">Võ Nguyên Giáp</a>, surrounded and <a href="Siege">besieged</a> the French. The Viet Minh brought in vast amounts of heavy artillery (including <a href="Antiaircraft%20warfare">antiaircraft guns</a>). They moved these weapons through difficult terrain up the rear slopes of the mountains surrounding the French positions, dug tunnels through the mountain, and placed the artillery pieces overlooking the French encampment. This positioning of the artillery made it nearly impervious to French <a href="counter-battery%20fire">counter-battery fire</a>.

The Viet Minh opened fire with a massive artillery bombardment in March. After several days the French artillery commander, <a href="Charles%20Piroth">Charles Piroth</a>, unable to respond with any effective counterbattery fire, committed suicide. The Viet Minh occupied the highlands around Điện Biên Phủ and bombarded the French positions. Tenacious fighting on the ground ensued, reminiscent of the <a href="trench%20warfare">trench warfare</a> of World War I. The French repeatedly repulsed Viet Minh assaults on their positions. Supplies and reinforcements were delivered by air, though as the key French positions were overrun, the French perimeter contracted and the air resupply on which the French had placed their hopes became impossible. As the Viet Minh antiaircraft fire took its toll, fewer and fewer of those supplies reached the French. The garrison was overrun in May after a two-month siege, and most of the French forces surrendered. A few of them escaped to Laos. The French government in Paris then resigned, and the new Prime Minister, the left-of-centre <a href="Pierre%20Mend%C3%A8s%20France">Pierre Mendès France</a>, supported French withdrawal from Indochina.

The war ended shortly after the Battle of Dien Bien Phu and the signing of the <a href="Geneva%20Conference%20%281954%29">1954 Geneva Accords</a>. France agreed to withdraw its forces from all its colonies in <a href="French%20Indochina">French Indochina</a>, while stipulating that Vietnam would be temporarily divided at the <a href="Vietnamese%20Demilitarized%20Zone">17th parallel</a>, with control of the north given to the Viet Minh as the <a href="North%20Vietnam">Democratic Republic of Vietnam</a> under <a href="Ho%20Chi%20Minh">Ho Chi Minh</a>, and the south becoming the <a href="South%20Vietnam">State of Vietnam</a>, nominally under Emperor <a href="B%E1%BA%A3o%20%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i">Bảo Đại</a>, preventing Ho Chi Minh from gaining control of the entire country. The refusal of <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Di%E1%BB%87m">Ngô Đình Diệm</a> (the US-supported president of the first Republic of Vietnam [RVN]) to allow elections in 1956, as had been stipulated by the Geneva Conference, eventually led to the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>.

By 1953, the <a href="First%20Indochina%20War">First Indochina War</a> was not going well for France. A succession of commanders – <a href="Philippe%20Leclerc%20de%20Hauteclocque">Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque</a>, <a href="Jean%20%C3%89tienne%20Valluy">Jean Étienne Valluy</a>, <a href="Roger%20Blaizot">Roger Blaizot</a>, <a href="Marcel%20Carpentier">Marcel Carpentier</a>, <a href="Jean%20de%20Lattre%20de%20Tassigny">Jean de Lattre de Tassigny</a>, and <a href="Raoul%20Salan">Raoul Salan</a> – had proven incapable of suppressing the insurrection of the <a href="Viet%20Minh">Viet Minh</a> fighting for independence. During their 1952–53 campaign, the Viet Minh had overrun vast swathes of <a href="Laos">Laos</a>, a French ally and Vietnam's western neighbor, advancing as far as <a href="Luang%20Prabang">Luang Prabang</a> and the <a href="Plain%20of%20Jars">Plain of Jars</a>. The French were unable to slow the Viet Minh advance, who fell back only after outrunning their always-tenuous supply lines. In 1953, the French had begun to strengthen their defenses in the <a href="Hanoi">Hanoi</a> delta region to prepare for a series of offensives against Viet Minh <a href="staging%20area">staging area</a>s in northwest Vietnam. They set up fortified towns and outposts in the area, including <a href="Lai%20Ch%C3%A2u">Lai Châu</a> near the Chinese border to the north, <a href="N%C3%A0%20S%E1%BA%A3n">Nà Sản</a> to the west of Hanoi, and the Plain of Jars in northern Laos.

In May 1953, French Premier <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Mayer">René Mayer</a> appointed <a href="Henri%20Navarre">Henri Navarre</a>, a trusted colleague, to take command of <a href="French%20Union">French Union</a> Forces in Indochina. Mayer had given Navarre a single order—to create military conditions that would lead to an "honorable political solution". According to military scholar <a href="Phillip%20Davidson">Phillip Davidson</a>,

Simultaneously, Navarre had been searching for a way to stop the Viet Minh threat to Laos. Colonel Louis Berteil, commander of Mobile Group 7 and Navarre's main planner, formulated the "hérisson" ("<a href="hedgehog%20defence">hedgehog</a>") concept. The French army would establish a fortified <a href="airhead%20%28warfare%29">airhead</a> by airlifting soldiers adjacent to a key Viet Minh supply line to Laos. They would cut off Viet Minh soldiers fighting in Laos and force them to withdraw. "It was an attempt to interdict the enemy's rear area, to stop the flow of supplies and reinforcements, to establish a redoubt in the enemy's rear and disrupt his lines".

The hedgehog concept was based on French experiences at the <a href="Battle%20of%20N%C3%A0%20S%E1%BA%A3n">Battle of Nà Sản</a>. In late November and early December 1952, Giáp attacked the French outpost at Nà Sản, which was essentially an "air-land base", a fortified camp supplied only by air. The French beat back Giáp's forces repeatedly, causing them to suffer very heavy losses. The French hoped that by repeating the strategy on a much larger scale, they would be able to lure Giáp into committing the bulk of his forces in a massed assault. This would enable superior French artillery, armor, and air support to decimate the exposed Viet Minh forces. The experience at Nà Sản convinced Navarre of the viability of the fortified airhead concept.

French staff officers disastrously failed to treat seriously several crucial differences between Điện Biên Phủ and Nà Sản:
First, at Nà Sản, the French commanded most of the high ground with overwhelming artillery support. At Điện Biên Phủ, however, the Viet Minh controlled much of the high ground around the valley, their artillery far exceeded French expectations, and they outnumbered the French troops four to one. Giáp compared Điện Biên Phủ to a "rice bowl," where his troops occupied the edge and the French the bottom. Second, Giáp made a mistake in Nà Sản by committing his forces to reckless frontal attacks before being fully prepared. He learned his lesson: at Điện Biên Phủ, Giáp spent months meticulously stockpiling ammunition and emplacing heavy artillery and antiaircraft guns before making his move. Teams of Viet Minh volunteers were sent into the French camp to scout the disposition of the French artillery. Artillery pieces were located within well constructed and camouflaged casemates. As a result, when the battle finally began, the Viet Minh knew exactly where the French artillery pieces were, while the French did not even know how many guns Giáp possessed. Third, the aerial resupply lines at Nà Sản were never severed, despite Viet Minh antiaircraft fire. At Điện Biên Phủ, Giáp amassed antiaircraft batteries that quickly shut down the runway, and made it extremely difficult and costly for the French to bring in reinforcements.

In June, <a href="Major%20General">Major General</a> <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Cogny">René Cogny</a>, the commander of the <a href="Tonkin">Tonkin</a> Delta, proposed <a href="%C4%90i%E1%BB%87n%20Bi%C3%AAn%20Ph%E1%BB%A7">Điện Biên Phủ</a>, which had an old airstrip built by the Japanese during World War II, as a "mooring point". In another misunderstanding, Cogny envisioned a lightly defended point from which to launch raids; however, Navarre believed that he intended a heavily fortified base capable of withstanding a siege. Navarre selected Điện Biên Phủ for the location of Berteil's "hedgehog" operation. When presented with the plan, every major subordinate officer protested: Colonel <a href="Jean-Louis%20Nicot">Jean-Louis Nicot</a> (commander of the French Air transport fleet), Cogny, and generals Jean Gilles and Jean Dechaux (the ground and air commanders for "Operation Castor," the initial airborne assault on Điện Biên Phủ). Cogny pointed out, presciently, that "we are running the risk of a new <a href="Battle%20of%20N%C3%A0%20S%E1%BA%A3n">Nà Sản</a> under worse conditions". Navarre rejected the criticisms of his proposal and concluded a 17 November conference by declaring that the operation would begin three days later, on 20 November 1953.

Navarre decided to go ahead with the operation, despite operational difficulties. These later became painfully obvious (but at the time may have been less apparent). He had been repeatedly assured by his intelligence officers that the operation had very little risk of involvement by a strong enemy force. Navarre had previously considered three other ways to defend Laos: <a href="maneuver%20warfare">mobile warfare</a>, which was impossible given the terrain in Vietnam; a <a href="static%20defense">static defense</a> line stretching to Laos, which was not feasible given the number of troops at Navarre's disposal; or placing troops in the Laotian provincial capitals and supplying them by air, which was unworkable due to the distance from <a href="Hanoi">Hanoi</a> to <a href="Luang%20Prabang">Luang Prabang</a> and <a href="Vientiane">Vientiane</a>. Navarre believed that he was left only with the hedgehog option, which he characterized as "a mediocre solution". The French National Defense Committee ultimately agreed that Navarre's responsibility did not include defending Laos. However, its decision (which was drawn up on 13 November) was not delivered to him until 4 December, two weeks after the Điện Biên Phủ operation began.

Operations at Điện Biên Phủ began at 10:35 on the morning of 20 November 1953. In "Operation Castor", the French dropped or flew 9,000 troops into the area over three days, including a bulldozer to prepare the airstrip. They were landed at three drop zones: "Natasha" (northwest), "Octavie" (southwest), and "Simone" (southeast) of Điện Biên Phủ. The Viet Minh elite 148th Independent Infantry Regiment, headquartered at Điện Biên Phủ, reacted "instantly and effectively". Three of its four battalions, however, were absent that day. 
Initial operations proceeded well for the French. By the end of November, six parachute battalions had been landed, and the French Army was consolidating its positions.

It was at this time that Giáp began his countermoves. He had expected an attack, but could not foresee when or where it would occur. Giáp realized that, if pressed, the French would abandon <a href="Lai%20Ch%C3%A2u%20Province">Lai Châu Province</a> and fight a <a href="pitched%20battle">pitched battle</a> at Điện Biên Phủ. On 24 November, Giáp ordered the 148th Infantry Regiment and the <a href="316th%20Division%20%28Vietnam%29">316th Division</a> to attack Lai Chau, while the <a href="308%20Division%20%28Vietnam%29">308th</a>, <a href="312th">312th</a>, and <a href="351st%20Division">351st</a> divisions assault Điện Biên Phủ from "<a href="Vi%E1%BB%87t%20B%E1%BA%AFc">Việt Bắc</a>".

Starting in December, the French, under the command of Colonel <a href="Christian%20de%20Castries">Christian de Castries</a>, began transforming their anchoring point into a fortress by setting up seven satellite positions. (Each was said to be named after a former mistress of de Castries, although the allegation is probably unfounded, as the eight names begin with letters from the first nine of the alphabet, excluding F.) The fortified headquarters was centrally located, with positions "Huguette" to the west, "Claudine" to the south, and "Dominique" to the northeast. The other positions were "Anne-Marie" to the northwest, "Beatrice" to the northeast, "Gabrielle" to the north, and "Isabelle" to the south, covering the reserve airstrip.

The choice of de Castries as the local commander at Điện Biên Phủ was, in retrospect, a bad one. Navarre had picked de Castries, a <a href="cavalry">cavalry</a>man in the 18th-century tradition, because Navarre envisioned Điện Biên Phủ as a mobile battle. Điện Biên Phủ required someone adept at World War I-style <a href="trench%20warfare">trench warfare</a>, something for which de Castries was not suited.

The arrival of the 316th Viet Minh Division prompted Cogny to order the evacuation of the Lai Chau garrison to Điện Biên Phủ, exactly as Giáp had anticipated. En route, they were virtually annihilated by the Viet Minh. "Of the 2,100 men who left Lai Chau on 9 December, only 185 made it to Điện Biên Phủ on 22 December. The rest had been killed, captured, or deserted". The Viet Minh troops converged on Điện Biên Phủ.

French military forces had committed 10,800 troops, together with yet more reinforcements, totalling nearly 16,000 men, to the defense of a monsoon-affected valley surrounded by heavily-wooded hills and high ground that had not been secured. Artillery as well as ten American <a href="M24%20Chaffee">M24 Chaffee</a> light tanks and numerous aircraft (attack and supply types) were committed to the garrison. This included France's regular troops (notably elite paratrooper units, plus those of the artillery), French <a href="French%20Foreign%20Legion">Foreign Legionnaires</a>, Algerian and Moroccan <a href="tirailleur">tirailleur</a>s (colonial troops from North Africa) and locally-recruited Indochinese (Laotian, Vietnamese and Cambodian) infantry.

In comparison, all together, the Viet Minh had moved up to 50,000 regular troops into the hills surrounding the French-held valley, totalling five divisions, including the 351st Heavy Division, which was an artillery formation and was entirely equipped with medium artillery, such as the US <a href="M101%20howitzer">M101</a> 105mm howitzer, supplied by the neighbouring People's Republic of China (PRC), together with some heavier field-guns as well as anti-aircraft artillery. Various types of artillery and anti-aircraft guns (mainly of Soviet origin), which outnumbered their French counterparts by about four to one, were moved into strategic positions and locations overlooking the valley and the French forces based there. The French garrison came under sporadic direct artillery fire from the Viet Minh for the first time on 31 January 1954 and patrols encountered the Viet Minh troops in all directions around them. The French were completely surrounded.

The Viet Minh assault began in earnest on 13 March 1954 with an attack on the northeastern outpost ""Béatrice"" which was held by the 3rd Battalion, 13th Foreign Legion Demi-Brigade. Viet Minh artillery opened a fierce bombardment with two batteries each of 105mm howitzers, 120mm mortars, and 75mm mountain guns (plus seventeen 57mm recoilless rifles and numerous 60mm and 81/82mm mortars) and French command was disrupted at 18:30 when a shell hit the French command post, killing the battalion's commander, Major Paul Pégot, and most of his staff. A few minutes later, Lieutenant-colonel <a href="Jules%20Gaucher">Jules Gaucher</a>, commander of the entire Central Subsector, was also killed by Viet Minh artillery. The Viet Minh 312th Division then launched a massive assault with its 141st and 209th Infantry Regiments, using <a href="sapper">sapper</a>s to breach the French obstacles. 

Béatrice comprised three separate strongpoints forming a triangle with the point facing north. In the southeast, strongpoint Beatrice-3, its defenses smashed by 75mm mountain guns firing at point-blank range, was quickly overrun by the 209th Regiment's 130th Battalion. In the north, most of Beatrice-1 was swiftly conquered by the 141st Regiment's 428th Battalion, but the defenders held out in corner of the position for a time because the attackers thought they had captured the entire strongpoint when they encountered an internal barbed wire barrier in the dark. In the southwest, the assault on Beatrice-2 by the 141st Regiment's 11th Battalion did not fare well because its assault trenches were too shallow and portions of them had been flattened by French artillery. Its efforts to breach Beatrice-2's barbed wire were stalled for hours by flanking fire from Beatrice-1 and several previously-undetected bunkers on Beatrice-2 that had been spared by the bombardment. The holdouts on Beatrice-1 were eliminated by 22:30 and the 141st Regiment's 11th and 16th Battalions finally broke into Beatrice-2 an hour later, though the strongpoint was not entirely taken until after 01:00 on March 14. Roughly 350 French legionnaires were killed, wounded or captured. About 100 managed to escape and rejoin the French lines. The French estimated that Viet Minh losses totalled 600 dead and 1,200 wounded. The victory at ""Beatrice"" "galvanized the morale" of the Viet Minh troops. On the following morning, a truce of a few hours was agreed and the French were authorized to come to the captured position and take some wounded, given back by the Viet Minh.

Much to French disbelief, the Viet Minh had employed direct artillery fire, in which each gun crew does its own <a href="artillery%20spotting">artillery spotting</a> (as opposed to indirect fire, in which guns are massed further away from the target, out of direct line of sight, and rely on a forward artillery spotter). Indirect artillery, generally held as being far superior to direct fire, requires experienced, well-trained crews and good communications, which the Viet Minh lacked. Navarre wrote that, "Under the influence of Chinese advisers, the Viet Minh commanders had used processes quite different from the classic methods. The artillery had been dug in by single pieces...They were installed in shellproof dugouts, and fire point-blank from portholes...This way of using artillery and AA guns was possible only with the expansive ant holes at the disposal of the Vietminh and was to make shambles of all the estimates of our own artillerymen." Two days later, the French artillery commander, Colonel <a href="Charles%20Piroth">Charles Piroth</a>, distraught at his inability to silence the well-camouflaged Viet Minh batteries, went into his dugout and committed suicide with a <a href="hand%20grenade">hand grenade</a>. He was buried there in secret to prevent loss of morale among the French troops.

Following a five-hour cease fire on the morning of 14 March, Viet Minh artillery resumed pounding French positions. The airstrip, already closed since 16:00 the day before due to a light bombardment, was now put permanently out of commission. Any further French supplies would have to be delivered by parachute. That night, the Viet Minh launched an attack on the northern outpost "Gabrielle", held by an elite Algerian battalion. The attack began with a concentrated artillery barrage at 17:00. This was very effective and stunned the defenders. Two regiments from the crack 308th Division attacked starting at 20:00. At 04:00 the following morning, an artillery shell hit the battalion headquarters, severely wounding the battalion commander and most of his staff.

De Castries ordered a counterattack to relieve "Gabrielle". However, Colonel <a href="Pierre%20Langlais">Pierre Langlais</a>, in forming the counterattack, chose to rely on the 5th Vietnamese Parachute Battalion, which had jumped in the day before and was exhausted. Although some elements of the counterattack reached "Gabrielle", most were paralyzed by Viet Minh artillery and took heavy losses. At 08:00 the next day, the Algerian battalion fell back, abandoning "Gabrielle" to the Viet Minh. The French lost around 1,000 men defending Gabrielle, and the Viet Minh between 1,000 and 2,000 attacking the strongpoint.

The northwestern outpost "Anne-Marie" was defended by <a href="Tai%20peoples">Tai troop</a>s, members of an ethnic minority loyal to the French. For weeks, Giáp had distributed subversive propaganda leaflets, telling the Tais that this was not their fight. The fall of "Beatrice" and "Gabrielle" had severely demoralized them. On the morning of 17 March, under the cover of fog, the bulk of the Tais left or defected. The French and the few remaining Tais on "Anne-Marie" were then forced to withdraw.

17 March through 30 March saw a lull in fighting. The Viet Minh further tightened the noose around the French central area (formed by the strongpoints "Huguette", "Dominique", "Claudine", and "Eliane"), effectively cutting off the Isabelle and its 1,809 personnel to the south. During this lull, the French suffered from a serious crisis of command. "It had become painfully evident to the senior officers within the encircled garrison – and even to Cogny at Hanoi – that de Castries was incompetent to conduct the defense of Dien Bien Phu. Even more critical, after the fall of the northern outposts, he isolated himself in his bunker so that he had, in effect, relinquished his command authority". On 17 March, Cogny attempted to fly into Điện Biên Phủ to take command, but his plane was driven off by antiaircraft fire. Cogny considered parachuting into the encircled garrison, but his staff talked him out of it.

De Castries' seclusion in his bunker, combined with his superiors' inability to replace him, created a leadership vacuum within the French command. On 24 March, an event took place which later became a matter of historical debate. The historian <a href="Bernard%20Fall">Bernard Fall</a> records, based on Langlais' memoirs, that Colonel Langlais and his fellow paratroop commanders, all fully armed, confronted de Castries in his bunker on 24 March. They told him he would retain the appearance of command, but that Langlais would exercise it. De Castries is said by Fall to have accepted the arrangement without protest, although he did exercise some command functions thereafter. Phillip Davidson stated that the "truth would seem to be that Langlais did take over effective command of Dien Bien Phu, and that Castries became 'commander emeritus' who transmitted messages to Hanoi and offered advice about matters in Dien Bien Phu". <a href="Jules%20Roy">Jules Roy</a>, however, makes no mention of this event, and <a href="Martin%20Windrow">Martin Windrow</a> argues that the "paratrooper putsch" is unlikely to have ever happened. Both historians record that Langlais and <a href="Marcel%20Bigeard">Marcel Bigeard</a> were known to be on good terms with their commanding officer.

The French aerial resupply took heavy losses from Viet Minh machine guns near the landing strip. On 27 March, the Hanoi air transport commander, Nicot, ordered that all supply deliveries be made from or higher; losses were expected to remain heavy. De Castries ordered an attack against the Viet Minh machine guns west of Điện Biên Phủ. Remarkably, the attack was a complete success, with 350 Viet Minh soldiers killed and seventeen AA machine guns destroyed (French estimate), while the French lost 20 killed and 97 wounded.

The next phase of the battle saw more massed Viet Minh assaults against French positions in the central Điện Biên Phủ – particularly at "Eliane" and "Dominique", the two remaining outposts east of the Nam Yum river. Those two areas were held by five understrength battalions, composed of Frenchmen, Legionnaires, Vietnamese, North Africans, and Tais. Giáp planned to use the tactics from the "Beatrice" and "Gabrielle" skirmishes.

At 19:00 on 30 March, the Viet Minh 312th Division captured "Dominique 1 and 2", making "Dominique 3" the final outpost between the Viet Minh and the French general headquarters, as well as outflanking all positions east of the river. At this point, the French 4th Colonial Artillery Regiment entered the fight, setting its <a href="Canon%20de%20105%20L%20mle%201936%20Schneider">105 mm howitzers</a> to zero elevation and firing directly on the Viet Minh attackers, blasting huge holes in their ranks. Another group of French soldiers, near the airfield, opened fire on the Viet Minh with antiaircraft machine guns, forcing the Viet Minh to retreat.

The Viet Minh's simultaneous attacks elsewhere were more successful. The 316th Division captured "Eliane 1" from its Moroccan defenders, and half of "Eliane 2" by midnight. On the west side of Điện Biên Phủ, the 308th attacked "Huguette 7", and nearly succeeded in breaking through, but a French sergeant took charge of the defenders and sealed the breach.

Just after midnight on 31 March, the French launched a counterattack against "Eliane 2", and recaptured half of it. Langlais ordered another counterattack the following afternoon against "Dominique 2" and "Eliane 1", using virtually "everybody left in the garrison who could be trusted to fight". The counterattacks allowed the French to retake "Dominique 2" and "Eliane 1", but the Viet Minh launched their own renewed assault. The French, who were exhausted and without reserves, fell back from both positions late in the afternoon. Reinforcements were sent north from "Isabelle", but were attacked en route and fell back to "Isabelle".

Shortly after dark on 31 March, Langlais told Major <a href="Marcel%20Bigeard">Marcel Bigeard</a>, who was leading the defense at "Eliane", to fall back across the river. Bigeard refused, saying "As long as I have one man alive I won't let go of 'Eliane 4'. Otherwise, Dien Bien Phu is done for." The night of the 31st, the 316th Division attacked "Eliane 2". Just as it appeared the French were about to be overrun, a few French tanks arrived, and helped push the Viet Minh back. Smaller attacks on "Eliane 4" were also pushed back. The Viet Minh briefly captured "Huguette 7", only to be pushed back by a French counterattack at dawn on 1 April.

Fighting continued in this manner over the next several nights. The Viet Minh repeatedly attacked "Eliane 2", only to be beaten back. Repeated attempts to reinforce the French garrison by parachute drops were made, but had to be carried out by lone planes at irregular times to avoid excessive casualties from Viet Minh antiaircraft fire. Some reinforcements did arrive, but not enough to replace French casualties.

On 5 April, after a long night of battle, French fighter-bombers and artillery inflicted particularly devastating losses on one Viet Minh regiment, which was caught on open ground. At that point, Giáp decided to change tactics. Although Giáp still had the same objective – to overrun French defenses east of the river – he decided to employ <a href="trench%20warfare">entrenchment and sapping</a> to try to achieve it.

On 10 April, the French attempted to retake "Eliane 1", which had been lost eleven days earlier. The loss posed a significant threat to "Eliane 4", and the French wanted to eliminate that threat. The dawn attack, which Bigeard devised, was preceded by a short, massive artillery barrage, followed by small unit <a href="infiltration%20tactics">infiltration attack</a>s, followed by mopping-up operations. "Eliane 1" changed hands several times that day, but by the next morning the French had control of the strongpoint. The Viet Minh attempted to retake it on the evening of 12 April, but were pushed back.

At this point, the morale of the Viet Minh soldiers was greatly lowered due to the massive casualties they had received from heavy French gunfire. During a period of stalemate from 15 April to 1 May, the French intercepted enemy radio messages which told of whole units refusing orders to attack, and communist prisoners in French hands said that they were told to advance or be shot by the officers and non-commissioned officers behind them, much like <a href="Order%20No.%20227">Stalin's "Not A Step Back!" decree</a> of WWII strictly forbidding troops to retreat and to advance on despite intense enemy fire. Worse still, the Viet Minh lacked advanced medical treatment and care, with one stating that, "Nothing strikes at combat-morale like the knowledge that if wounded, the soldier will go uncared for,". Concerned about a potential mutiny from his troops, Giap had to whistle up fresh reinforcements from neighbouring Laos for bolstering his dwindling and dispirited forces.

During the fighting at "Eliane 1", on the other side of camp, the Viet Minh entrenchments had almost entirely surrounded "Huguette 1 and 6". On 11 April, the garrison of "Huguette 1" attacked, and was joined by artillery from the garrison of "Claudine". The goal was to resupply "Huguette 6" with water and ammunition. The attacks were repeated on the nights of the 14–15 and 16–17 April. While they did succeed in getting some supplies through, the French suffered heavy casualties, which convinced Langlais to abandon "Huguette 6". Following a failed attempt to link up, on 18 April, the defenders at "Huguette 6" made a daring break out, but only a few managed to make it to French lines. The Viet Minh repeated the isolation and probing attacks against Huguette 1, and overran the fort on the morning of 22 April. With the fall of "Huguette 1", the Viet Minh took control of more than 90 percent of the airfield, making accurate parachute drops impossible. This caused the landing zone to become perilously small, and effectively choked off much needed supplies. A French attack against "Huguette 1" later that day was repulsed.

"Isabelle" saw only light action until 30 March, when the Viet Minh isolated it and beat back the attempt to send reinforcements north. Following a massive artillery barrage on 30 March, the Viet Minh began employing the same trench warfare tactics that they were using against the central camp. By the end of April, "Isabelle" had exhausted its water supply and was nearly out of ammunition.

The Viet Minh launched a massed assault against the exhausted defenders on the night of 1 May, overrunning "Eliane 1", "Dominique 3", and "Huguette 5", although the French managed to beat back attacks on "Eliane 2". On 6 May, the Viet Minh launched another massed attack against "Eliane 2". The attack included, for the first time, <a href="Katyusha%20rocket%20launcher">Katyusha rocket</a>s. The French artillery fired a "TOT" (<a href="Time%20on%20Target">Time on Target</a>) attack, so artillery rounds fired from different positions would strike on target at the same time. This barrage defeated the first assault wave. A few hours later that night, the Viet Minh detonated a mine shaft, blowing "Eliane 2" up. The Viet Minh attacked again, and within a few hours then had overrun the defenders.

On 7 May, Giáp ordered an all-out attack against the remaining French units with over 25,000 Viet Minh against fewer than 3,000 garrison troops. At 17:00, de Castries radioed French headquarters in Hanoi and talked with Cogny. 

The last radio transmission from the French headquarters reported that enemy troops were directly outside the headquarters bunker and that all the positions had been overrun. The radio operator in his last words stated: "The enemy has overrun us. We are blowing up everything. "Vive la France"!" That night the garrison made a breakout attempt, in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Camar%C3%B3n">Camarón tradition</a>. While some of the main body managed to break out, none succeeded in escaping from the valley. However at "Isabelle", a similar attempt later the same night saw about 70 troops, out of 1,700 men in the garrison, escape to Laos. By about 6:20 pm, only one French position, strongpoint Lily, manned by Moroccan soldiers commanded by a French officer, Major Jean Nicholas, had not been overrun. The position surrendered that night when Nicholas personally waved a small <a href="white%20flag">white flag</a> (probably a handkerchief) from his rifle.

On 8 May, the Viet Minh counted 11,721 prisoners, of whom 4,436 were wounded. This was the greatest number the Viet Minh had ever captured: one-third of the total captured during the entire war. The prisoners were divided into groups. Able-bodied soldiers were force-marched over to prison camps to the north and east, where they were intermingled with Viet Minh soldiers to discourage French bombing runs. Hundreds died of disease along the way. The wounded were given basic first aid until the <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> arrived, extracted 858 prisoners, and provided better aid to the remainder. Those wounded who were not evacuated by the Red Cross were sent into detention.

The Viet Minh captured 8,000 French and marched them 500 miles on foot to prison camps; less than half survived the march. Of 10,863 prisoners (including Vietnamese fighting for the French), only 3,290 were officially repatriated four months later; however, the losses figure may include the 3,013 prisoners of Vietnamese origin whose eventual fate is unknown.

The garrison constituted roughly a tenth of the total French Union manpower in Indochina. The defeat seriously weakened the position and prestige of the French as previously planned negotiations over the future of Indochina began.

The <a href="Geneva%20Conference%20%281954%29">Geneva Conference</a> opened on 8 May 1954, the day after the surrender of the garrison. The resulting agreement partitioned Vietnam into two zones: <a href="communist">communist</a> <a href="North%20Vietnam">North Vietnam</a> and the <a href="State%20of%20Vietnam">State of Vietnam</a>, which opposed the agreement, to the south. The partition was supposed to be temporary, and the two zones were meant to be reunited through national elections in 1956, which were never held. The last French forces withdrew from Vietnam in 1956.

General <a href="Georges%20Catroux">Georges Catroux</a> presided over a commission of inquiry into the defeat. The commission's final report ("Rapport concernant la conduite des opérations en Indochine sous la direction du général Navarre") concluded:

The fall of Dien Bien Phu, in a strictly military perspective, represented a very serious failure but one that in the immediate, that is to say, spring of 1954, did not upset the balance of forces present in Indochina. It only assumed the aspect of a definitive defeat of our forces by reason of its profound psychological effects on French public opinion, which, tired of a war that was unpopular and seemingly without end, demanded in a way that it be ended.The event itself was in fact, both in terms of public opinion and of the military conduct of the war and operations, merely the end result of a long process of degradation of a faraway enterprise which, not having the assent of the nation, could not receive from the authorities the energetic impulse, and the size and continuity of efforts required for success.
If, therefore, one wishes to establish objectively the responsibilities incurred in the final phase of the Indochina war one would have to examine its origins and evoke the acts and decisions of the various governments in power, that is to say their war policies, as well as the ways in which these policies were translated by the military commanders into operations.

According to the <a href="Mutual%20Defense%20Assistance%20Act">Mutual Defense Assistance Act</a>, the United States provided the French with material aid during the battle – aircraft (supplied by the ), weapons, mechanics, 24 <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">CIA</a>/<a href="Civil%20Air%20Transport">CAT</a> pilots, and <a href="U.S.%20Air%20Force">U.S. Air Force</a> maintenance crews. The United States, however, intentionally avoided overt direct intervention. In February 1954, following the French occupation of Điện Biên Phủ but before the battle, Democratic senator <a href="Mike%20Mansfield">Michael Mansfield</a> asked the <a href="United%20States%20Defense%20Secretary">United States Defense Secretary</a>, <a href="Charles%20Erwin%20Wilson">Charles Erwin Wilson</a>, whether the United States would send naval or air units if the French were subjected to greater pressure there, but Wilson replied that "for the moment there is no justification for raising United States aid above its present level". <a href="President%20Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">President Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> also stated, "Nobody is more opposed to intervention than I am". On 31 March, following the fall of "Beatrice", "Gabrielle", and "Anne-Marie", a panel of U.S. Senators and House Representatives questioned the American <a href="Chairman%20of%20the%20Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff</a>, Admiral <a href="Arthur%20W.%20Radford">Arthur W. Radford</a>, about the possibility of American involvement. Radford concluded it was too late for the U.S. Air Force to save the French garrison. A proposal for direct intervention was unanimously voted down by the committee, which "concluded that intervention was a positive <a href="Casus%20belli">act of war</a>".

The United States did covertly participate in the battle. Following a request for help from <a href="Henri%20Navarre">Henri Navarre</a>, Radford provided two squadrons of <a href="A-26%20Invader">B-26 Invader</a> bomber aircraft to support the French. Following this, 37 American transport pilots flew 682 sorties over the course of the battle. Earlier, in order to succeed the pre-Điện Biên Phủ <a href="Operation%20Castor">Operation Castor</a> of November 1953, General <a href="Chester%20McCarty">Chester McCarty</a> made available 12 additional <a href="C-119%20Flying%20Boxcar">C-119 Flying Boxcar</a>s flown by French crews.

Two of the American pilots, <a href="James%20B.%20McGovern%2C%20Jr.">James McGovern, Jr.</a>, and <a href="Wallace%20Buford">Wallace Buford</a>, were killed in action during the siege of Điện Biên Phủ. On 25 February 2005, the seven still living American pilots were awarded the French <a href="Legion%20of%20Honor">Legion of Honor</a> by <a href="Jean-David%20Levitte">Jean-David Levitte</a>, the French ambassador to the United States. The role that the American pilots played in this battle had remained little known until 2004. The American historian Erik Kirsinger researched the case for more than a year to establish the facts.

The French author <a href="Jules%20Roy">Jules Roy</a> suggests that Admiral Radford discussed with the French the possibility of using <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s in support of the French garrison. Moreover, <a href="John%20Foster%20Dulles">John Foster Dulles</a> reportedly mentioned the possibility of lending atomic bombs to the French for use at Điện Biên Phủ, and a similar source claims that the British Foreign Secretary Sir <a href="Anthony%20Eden">Anthony Eden</a> was aware of the possibility of the use of nuclear weapons in that region.

In January 1968, during the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, the <a href="North%20Vietnamese%20Army">North Vietnamese Army</a> under Võ Nguyên Giáp's command initiated a <a href="siege">siege</a> and artillery <a href="bombardment">bombardment</a> on the <a href="U.S.%20Marine%20Corps">U.S. Marine Corps</a> base at <a href="Khe%20Sanh">Khe Sanh</a>, <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a> just like what they did in Dien Bien Phu. Võ Nguyên Giáp's Sieged Khe Sanh for 77 days. Historians are divided on whether this was a genuine attempt to repeat their success at Điện Biên Phủ by forcing the surrender of the Marine base, or else a diversion from the rest of the <a href="Tet%20Offensive">Tết Offensive</a>, or an example of the North Vietnamese Army keeping its options open. At Khe Sanh, a number of factors were significantly different from Điện Biên Phủ. Khe Sanh was much closer to an American supply base () compared to a French one at Điện Biên Phủ ().

At Khe Sanh, the U.S. Marines held the high ground, and their artillery forced the North Vietnamese to use their own artillery from a much greater distance. By contrast, at Điện Biên Phủ, the French artillery (six 105 mm batteries and one battery of four 155 mm howitzers and mortars) was only sporadically effective. Furthermore, by 1968, the American military presence in Vietnam dwarfed that of the French, and included numerous technological advances such as effective helicopters.

Khe Sanh received 18,000 tons of aerial resupplies during the 77-day battle, whereas during the 167 days that the French forces at Điện Biên Phủ held out, they received only 4,000 tons. Also, the <a href="US%20Air%20Force">US Air Force</a> dropped 114,810 tons of bombs upon the Vietnamese at Khe Sanh – roughly as many as on Japan during 1945 during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

Many of the flights operated by the French Air force to evacuate casualties had female flight nurses on board. A total of 15 women served on flights to Điện Biên Phủ. One, <a href="Genevi%C3%A8ve%20de%20Galard">Geneviève de Galard</a>, was stranded there when her plane was destroyed by shellfire while being repaired on the airfield. She remained on the ground providing medical services in the field hospital until the surrender. She was referred to as the "Angel of Điện Biên Phủ". Historians disagree regarding this moniker, with <a href="Martin%20Windrow">Martin Windrow</a> maintaining that de Galard was referred to by this name by the garrison itself, but <a href="Michael%20Kenney%20%28journalist%29">Michael Kenney</a> and <a href="Bernard%20Fall">Bernard Fall</a> maintaining it was added by outside press agencies.

The French forces came to Điện Biên Phủ accompanied by two "<a href="bordels%20mobiles%20de%20campagne">bordels mobiles de campagne</a>", ("mobile field brothels"), served by Algerian and Vietnamese women. When the siege ended, the Viet Minh sent the surviving Vietnamese women for "re-education".

The Vietnamese Government has stated its casualties in the battle as 4,020 dead, 9,118 wounded and 792 missing. The French estimated Viet Minh casualties at 8,000 dead and 15,000 wounded. <a href="Max%20Hastings">Max Hastings</a> stated that "In 2018 Hanoi has still not credibly enumerated its Dienbienphu losses, surely a reflection of their immensity."

This battle was depicted in at least three films:

It was also mentioned in the <a href="Billy%20Joel">Billy Joel</a> song "<a href="We%20Didn%27t%20Start%20the%20Fire">We Didn't Start the Fire</a>".

Today the battlefield is a large historical site. French positions such as Beatrice, Isabelle, Elaine, Muong Thanh Bridge and De Castries's Bunker have been preserved. Nearly 30 kilometres away from the centre of Dien Bien Phu lays the Viet Minh army complex ranging from shelters and trenches, also preserved in Muong Phang village. A 96-meter underground tunnel connects the working places of General <a href="V%C3%B5%20Nguy%C3%AAn%20Gi%C3%A1p">Võ Nguyên Giáp</a> and General <a href="Ho%C3%A0ng%20V%C4%83n%20Th%C3%A1i">Hoàng Văn Thái</a>. In addition monuments and memorials to both sides are situated in the region.

New Jersey Devils

The New Jersey Devils are a <a href="professional%20sports">professional</a> <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a> team based in <a href="Newark%2C%20New%20Jersey">Newark, New Jersey</a>. They are members of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Division">Metropolitan Division</a> of the <a href="Eastern%20Conference%20%28NHL%29">Eastern Conference</a> of the <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a> (NHL). The club was founded as the <a href="Kansas%20City%20Scouts">Kansas City Scouts</a> in <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City, Missouri</a>, in <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20NHL%20season">1974</a>. The Scouts moved to <a href="Denver">Denver, Colorado</a> in <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20NHL%20season">1976</a> and became the <a href="Colorado%20Rockies%20%28NHL%29">Colorado Rockies</a>. In <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20NHL%20season">1982</a>, they moved to <a href="East%20Rutherford%2C%20New%20Jersey">East Rutherford, New Jersey</a> and took their current name. For their first 25 seasons in New Jersey, the Devils were based at the <a href="Meadowlands%20Sports%20Complex">Meadowlands Sports Complex</a> in East Rutherford and played their home games at <a href="Brendan%20Byrne%20Arena">Brendan Byrne Arena</a> (later renamed to Continental Airlines Arena). Before the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20New%20Jersey%20Devils%20season">2007–08 season</a>, the Devils relocated to Newark and now play their home games at <a href="Prudential%20Center">Prudential Center</a>.

The franchise was poor to mediocre in the eight years before moving to New Jersey, a pattern that continued during the first five years in New Jersey as they failed to make the <a href="Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs">Stanley Cup playoffs</a> and never finished higher than fifth in their division. Their fortunes began to turn around following the hiring of president and <a href="General%20manager%20%28ice%20hockey%29">general manager</a> <a href="Lou%20Lamoriello">Lou Lamoriello</a> in 1987. Under Lamoriello's stewardship, the Devils made the playoffs all but three times between 1988 and 2012, including 13 berths in a row from 1997 to 2010, and finished with a winning record every season from 1992–93 to 2009–10. They have won the <a href="Atlantic%20Division%20%28NHL%29">Atlantic Division</a> regular season title nine times, most recently in 2009–10, before transferring to the newly created Metropolitan Division as part of the NHL's realignment in 2013. The Devils have reached the <a href="Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">Stanley Cup Finals</a> five times, winning in <a href="1995%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">1994–95</a>, <a href="2000%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">1999–00</a> and <a href="2003%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">2002–03</a>. The Devils were known for their defense-first approach throughout their years of Cup contention, but have since moved towards a more offensive style.

The Devils have a <a href="Devils%E2%80%93Rangers%20rivalry">rivalry</a> with their cross-<a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a> neighbor, the <a href="New%20York%20Rangers">New York Rangers</a>, as well as a <a href="Devils%E2%80%93Flyers%20rivalry">rivalry</a> with the <a href="Philadelphia%20Flyers">Philadelphia Flyers</a>. The Devils are one of three NHL teams in the <a href="New%20York%20metropolitan%20area">New York metropolitan area</a>; the other two teams are the <a href="New%20York%20Islanders">New York Islanders</a> and New York Rangers. With the move of the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Nets">New Jersey Nets</a> to <a href="Brooklyn%2C%20New%20York">Brooklyn</a> in 2012, the franchise is the only <a href="Major%20professional%20sports%20teams%20of%20the%20United%20States%20and%20Canada">major league team</a> in any sport that explicitly identifies itself as a New Jersey team.

In 1972, the NHL announced plans to add two <a href="expansion%20team">expansion team</a>s, including one in <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City, Missouri</a> owned by a group headed by Edwin G. Thompson. The new team was nicknamed the Scouts in reference to <a href="Cyrus%20E.%20Dallin">Cyrus E. Dallin</a>'s <a href="The%20Scout%20%28Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri%20statue%29">statue of the same name</a> which stands in that city's <a href="Penn%20Valley%20Park">Penn Valley Park</a>. In the team's inaugural season, <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20NHL%20season">1974–75</a>, the Scouts were forced to wait until the ninth game to play in Kansas City's Kemper Arena, and did not post a win until beating the <a href="Washington%20Capitals">Washington Capitals</a>, their expansion brethren, in their tenth contest. With 41 points in their inaugural season, the Scouts finished last in the <a href="Smythe%20Division">Smythe Division</a>; only the Capitals had fewer points in the NHL. Kansas City fell to 36 points <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20NHL%20season">the following season</a>, and had a 27-game win-less streak, three short of the NHL record, which was set when the 1980-81 Winnipeg Jets went 30 games without a win. The Scouts had difficulty drawing fans to home games, and <a href="National%20Hockey%20League%20Players%27%20Association">National Hockey League Players' Association</a> (NHLPA) leader <a href="Alan%20Eagleson">Alan Eagleson</a> publicly expressed concerns about whether Scouts players would be paid.

After two seasons in Kansas City, the franchise moved to <a href="Denver">Denver</a> and was renamed the <a href="Colorado%20Rockies%20%28NHL%29">Colorado Rockies</a> it played at the <a href="McNichols%20Sports%20Arena">McNichols Sports Arena</a>. The team won its first game as the Rockies, 4–2, against the <a href="Toronto%20Maple%20Leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a>. The Rockies were in position to qualify for the playoffs 60 games into the <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20NHL%20season">1976–77 season</a>, but a streak of 18 games without a win caused them to fall from contention. The Rockies ended the campaign last in the division with a 20–46–14 record and 54 points, and improved to 59 points the <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20NHL%20season">next season</a>. Despite having the sixth-worst record in the League, the Rockies beat-out the <a href="Vancouver%20Canucks">Vancouver Canucks</a> for second in the Division by two points and gained a playoff berth. The <a href="Philadelphia%20Flyers">Philadelphia Flyers</a> eliminated the Rockies from the playoffs in the Preliminary Round.

A lack of stability continually plagued the team. In their first eight years, the Scouts/Rockies went through ten coaches, none lasting two full seasons.

The franchise never won more than 22 games and did not return to the playoffs after 1977–78 in its six seasons in Colorado. Prior to the <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20NHL%20season">1978–79 season</a>, the team was sold to New Jersey trucking tycoon <a href="Arthur%20Imperatore%2C%20Sr.">Arthur Imperatore</a>, who intended to move the team to his home state. The plan was criticized due to the existence of three other NHL teams in the region. In any event, their intended home in the Meadowlands was still under construction, and there was no nearby facility suitable even for temporary use; the franchise ultimately stayed in Denver. In 1979, the team hired <a href="Don%20Cherry%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Don Cherry</a> as head coach and featured forward <a href="Lanny%20McDonald">Lanny McDonald</a>. The Rockies still posted the worst record in the NHL, and Cherry was subsequently fired after the season. After two more years in Denver, the Rockies were sold to a group headed by <a href="John%20McMullen%20%28engineer%29">John McMullen</a> (who also owned <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>'s <a href="Houston%20Astros">Houston Astros</a>) on May 27, 1982, and the franchise moved to New Jersey. As part of the relocation deal, the Devils had to compensate the three existing teams in the region – the <a href="New%20York%20Islanders">New York Islanders</a>, <a href="New%20York%20Rangers">New York Rangers</a> and Flyers – for encroaching on their territory.

On June 30, 1982, the team was renamed the New Jersey Devils, after the legend of the <a href="Jersey%20Devil">Jersey Devil</a>, a creature that allegedly inhabited the <a href="Pine%20Barrens%20%28New%20Jersey%29">Pine Barrens</a> of South Jersey. Over 10,000 people voted in a contest held to select the name. The team began play in <a href="East%20Rutherford%2C%20New%20Jersey">East Rutherford, New Jersey</a> at the Brendan Byrne Arena, later renamed the Continental Airlines Arena and then the <a href="Izod%20Center">Izod Center</a>, where they called home through the 2006–07 season. The Devils were initially placed in the <a href="Patrick%20Division">Patrick Division</a>. Their first game ended in a 3–3 tie against the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Penguins">Pittsburgh Penguins</a>, with their first goal scored by <a href="Don%20Lever">Don Lever</a>. Their first win, a 3–2 victory, came in New Jersey at the expense of the Rangers. The team finished with a 17–49–14 record, putting them three points above last place in the Patrick Division.

In the following season, the Devils were criticized by <a href="Wayne%20Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a> after a 13–4 loss to the <a href="Edmonton%20Oilers">Edmonton Oilers</a>. In a post-game interview, Gretzky said that the Devils were "putting a <a href="Mickey%20Mouse%23Pejorative%20use%20of%20Mickey%27s%20name">Mickey Mouse operation</a> on the ice." Later, Gretzky said that his comment was "blown out of proportion." In response, many Devils fans wore <a href="Mickey%20Mouse">Mickey Mouse</a> apparel when the Oilers returned to New Jersey. Also in the <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20NHL%20season">1983–84 season</a>, the Devils hosted the annual <a href="National%20Hockey%20League%20All-Star%20Game">NHL All-Star Game</a>. New Jersey's <a href="Chico%20Resch">Chico Resch</a> was the winning goaltender, and Devils defenseman <a href="Joe%20Cirella">Joe Cirella</a> tallied a goal as the Wales Conference beat the Campbell Conference 7–6. Overall, the team did not achieve much success. Head coach <a href="Bill%20MacMillan">Bill MacMillan</a> was fired 20 games into the season, whereupon <a href="Tom%20McVie">Tom McVie</a> was named the new coach. The Devils won only 17 games and after the season, <a href="Doug%20Carpenter">Doug Carpenter</a> succeeded McVie.

The Devils assembled a core of players that included <a href="John%20MacLean%20%28ice%20hockey%29">John MacLean</a>, <a href="Bruce%20Driver">Bruce Driver</a>, <a href="Ken%20Daneyko">Ken Daneyko</a>, <a href="Kirk%20Muller">Kirk Muller</a> and <a href="Pat%20Verbeek">Pat Verbeek</a>, with Resch as their goaltender. Their record improved each season between 1983–84 and 1986–87. However, they were unable to reach the playoffs. Despite their improvement, the Devils remained last in the Patrick Division in 1985–86 and 1986–87. McMullen hired <a href="Providence%20College">Providence College</a> athletic director <a href="Lou%20Lamoriello">Lou Lamoriello</a> as team president in April 1987. To gain greater control over franchise operations, Lamoriello appointed himself general manager before the <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20NHL%20season">1987–88 season</a>.
The 1987–88 Devils garnered the franchise's first winning record. On the final day of the regular season, they were tied with their rivals, the Rangers, for the final playoff spot in the Patrick Division. After New York defeated the <a href="Quebec%20Nordiques">Quebec Nordiques</a> 3–0, the Devils needed to defeat the <a href="Chicago%20Blackhawks">Chicago Blackhawks</a> for a post-season berth. The Devils were trailing 3–2 midway through the third period when John MacLean tied the game, and with 2:39 left in overtime, he added the winning goal. Although the Rangers and Devils both finished with 82 points, the Devils had two more wins, sending them to the playoffs for the first time in franchise history as the New Jersey Devils. The team made it all the way to the Wales Conference Finals in the <a href="1988%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs">1988 Stanley Cup playoffs</a>, but lost to the <a href="Boston%20Bruins">Boston Bruins</a> in seven games. In that series, head coach <a href="Jim%20Schoenfeld">Jim Schoenfeld</a> verbally abused referee <a href="Don%20Koharski">Don Koharski</a> after the third game, screaming at him. During the exchange, Koharski fell and Schoenfeld said to him "Good, 'cause you fell, you fat pig! Have another doughnut! Have another doughnut!" Schoenfeld was given a suspension by the NHL, but due to a favorable court order, he was able to coach in the fourth game of the series. In protest, referee Dave Newell and linesmen Gord Broseker and Ray Scapinello refused to work the game. Three off-ice officials – Paul McInnis, Jim Sullivan and Vin Godleski – were tracked down to work the game. After the injunction was lifted, Schoenfeld's suspension was imposed in the following game.

<a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20NHL%20season">The next season</a>, the Devils once again slipped below .500 and missed the playoffs. Among the post-season player changes Lamoriello made in the off-season was the signing of two Soviet stars – <a href="Viacheslav%20Fetisov">Viacheslav Fetisov</a> and <a href="Sergei%20Starikov">Sergei Starikov</a>. The Devils drafted Fetisov years earlier in the <a href="1983%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">1983 Entry Draft</a>, but the <a href="government%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Soviet Government</a> did not allow Fetisov, who was a member of the <a href="Soviet%20Union%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">national team</a>, to leave the country. Shortly after, the Devils signed Fetisov's defense partner, <a href="Alexei%20Kasatonov">Alexei Kasatonov</a>.

The team changed coaches midway through each of the next two seasons. Schoenfeld was replaced with <a href="John%20Cunniff">John Cunniff</a> in <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20NHL%20season">1989–90</a>, and <a href="Tom%20McVie">Tom McVie</a> was hired midway through the <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20NHL%20season">1990–91 season</a> and helmed the team through its third-straight Division Semifinals' elimination in <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20NHL%20season">1991–92</a>. <a href="Herb%20Brooks">Herb Brooks</a>, who coached the 1980 U.S. Olympic "<a href="Miracle%20on%20Ice">Miracle on Ice</a>" team, was brought in for the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20NHL%20season">1992–93 season</a>, but when the team yet again was eliminated in the Division Semifinals, he was fired and replaced by former <a href="Montreal%20Canadiens">Montreal Canadiens</a> head coach <a href="Jacques%20Lemaire">Jacques Lemaire</a>.

Under Lemaire, the team played during the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20NHL%20season">1993–94 regular season</a> with a lineup that included defensemen <a href="Scott%20Stevens">Scott Stevens</a>, <a href="Scott%20Niedermayer">Scott Niedermayer</a> and <a href="Ken%20Daneyko">Ken Daneyko</a>; forwards <a href="St%C3%A9phane%20Richer%20%28ice%20hockey%20forward%29">Stephane Richer</a>, John MacLean, <a href="Bobby%20Hol%C3%ADk">Bobby Holik</a> and <a href="Claude%20Lemieux">Claude Lemieux</a>; and goaltenders <a href="Chris%20Terreri">Chris Terreri</a> and <a href="Martin%20Brodeur">Martin Brodeur</a>, the latter goaltender was honored as the NHL's top rookie with the <a href="Calder%20Memorial%20Trophy">Calder Memorial Trophy</a>. The Devils scored 330 times in the regular season and set a franchise record with 106 points, second behind the New York Rangers in the Atlantic Division. The Devils and Rangers met in an Eastern Conference Finals match-up, which went seven games. Going into Game 6 in New Jersey, the Devils led the series three games to two. Before the game, Rangers captain <a href="Mark%20Messier">Mark Messier</a> guaranteed that the Rangers would win Game 6. Messier led his team back, netting a <a href="Hat-trick%23Variations">natural hat-trick</a> to help the Rangers overcome an early 2–0 Devils lead and force a decisive contest. In Game 7, the Devils' <a href="Valeri%20Zelepukin">Valeri Zelepukin</a> tied the score at 1–1 with 7.7 seconds remaining, but the Devils were defeated in double overtime on a goal by <a href="St%C3%A9phane%20Matteau">Stéphane Matteau</a>.

Despite the setback, the team returned to the Eastern Conference Finals during the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20NHL%20lockout">lockout-shortened</a> <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20NHL%20season">1994–95 season</a> and defeated the Philadelphia Flyers four games to two. They swept the heavily favored <a href="Detroit%20Red%20Wings">Detroit Red Wings</a> to win New Jersey's first-ever Stanley Cup, as they brought the Cup across the Hudson River from New York, after the Rangers had won it the year before. The 1995 Devils team became the first to give the players a day with the Stanley Cup, a tradition that lives on with each Cup winner. Claude Lemieux was awarded the <a href="Conn%20Smythe%20Trophy">Conn Smythe Trophy</a> as playoffs MVP. The success came amid constant rumors that the team would move for the third time in its history to <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville</a>.
Staring at the prospect of losing the team, the state agreed to fund a renovation of the Devils' arena.

The Devils missed the playoffs by two points the following season, with a 37–33–12 record. They were beaten by the <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Lightning">Tampa Bay Lightning</a> for the last playoff spot in the East on the last day of the season, after a 5–2 loss to the <a href="Ottawa%20Senators">Ottawa Senators</a> in a must-win game. It marked the first time in 26 years that a defending Cup champion failed to reach the playoffs. For the remainder of the decade, the Devils won at least 45 games every season, but were unable to make a deep playoff run. Despite posting 104 points in the <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20NHL%20season">1996–97 season</a> and 107 in <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20NHL%20season">1997–98</a>, they were ousted by the Rangers four games to one in the Conference Semifinals of the 1997 playoffs and in the Conference Quarterfinals by the Senators four games to two a year later. Lemaire resigned after that season and was replaced by assistant coach <a href="Robbie%20Ftorek">Robbie Ftorek</a>. However, the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20NHL%20season">next season</a> ended as the previous one, with a Conference Quarterfinals' loss, this time to the Pittsburgh Penguins.

Late in the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20NHL%20season">1999–2000 season</a>, Lamoriello made the decision to fire Ftorek and replace him with assistant coach <a href="Larry%20Robinson">Larry Robinson</a>, which the "<a href="New%20York%20Post">New York Post</a>"'s Mark Everson described as "pure panic" at the prospect of another early-round playoff elimination. The Devils were in position to reach the playoffs, but Lamoriello reacted to a stretch of 17 games in which the team went 5–10–2. New Jersey followed the move by defeating the <a href="Florida%20Panthers">Florida Panthers</a>, the <a href="Toronto%20Maple%20Leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a> and the Philadelphia Flyers during the post-season to make the Finals. In the Finals, the Devils reached the top again, defeating the defending champion <a href="Dallas%20Stars">Dallas Stars</a> in six games to win the Stanley Cup for the second time. Veterans such as Stevens, Holik, Niedermayer, Daneyko, and Brodeur were joined by new players acquired in the intervening five years, including <a href="Patrik%20Eli%C3%A1%C5%A1">Patrik Elias</a>, <a href="Petr%20S%C3%BDkora">Petr Sykora</a>, <a href="Jason%20Arnott">Jason Arnott</a>, <a href="Alexander%20Mogilny">Alexander Mogilny</a> and Calder Trophy recipient <a href="Scott%20Gomez">Scott Gomez</a>. The Devils' second championship run included a come-from-behind victory in the Conference Finals. They trailed the Flyers three games to one, but rebounded to win three-straight games and the series. This was the first time in NHL Conference Finals history that a 3–1 series deficit was surmounted. This series featured a hit that captain Scott Stevens laid on Flyers center <a href="Eric%20Lindros">Eric Lindros</a> in the seventh game, which effectively ended Lindros' career in Philadelphia. Stevens was named the winner of the Conn Smythe Trophy, as the Devils clinched the Stanley Cup on Arnott's goal in double-overtime of Game 6 in Dallas.

In 2000, McMullen sold the team to Puck Holdings, an affiliate of <a href="YankeeNets">YankeeNets</a>, for $176 million. The owners wanted to program Devils games on what eventually became the <a href="YES%20Network">YES Network</a> and move the team to a new arena in <a href="Newark%2C%20New%20Jersey">Newark</a>. Neither of these proposals became reality under Puck Holdings' ownership. For the start of the next season, Lamoriello was appointed CEO of both the Devils and the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Nets">New Jersey Nets</a> of the <a href="National%20Basketball%20Association">National Basketball Association</a> (NBA). He remained at the helm of the basketball team until it was sold with the intention of moving it to <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> in 2004.

Led by the Elias-Arnott-Sykora line (The A Line) on offense and the goaltending of Brodeur (who appeared in a record 97 games between the regular season and playoffs), the Devils reached the <a href="2001%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">Stanley Cup Finals</a> for the second-straight year in <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20NHL%20season">2001</a>. They lost the series to the <a href="Colorado%20Avalanche">Colorado Avalanche</a> despite leading 3–2. <a href="John%20Madden%20%28ice%20hockey%29">John Madden</a> became the first player in franchise history to win the <a href="Frank%20J.%20Selke%20Trophy">Frank J. Selke Trophy</a> for top defensive forward. In the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20NHL%20season">2001–02 season</a>, they were expected to be contenders once again, and they finished the season as the third-best team in the Atlantic Division, with 95 points. The Devils entered the playoffs as a sixth seed, but lost in the Conference Quarterfinals to the third-seeded <a href="Carolina%20Hurricanes">Carolina Hurricanes</a>.

In <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20NHL%20season">2003</a>, the Devils finished first in the Atlantic Division with 108 points. Their <a href="2003%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs">playoff</a> run included a seven-game Conference Final series victory, decided in the final three minutes on a goal by forward <a href="Jeff%20Friesen">Jeff Friesen</a>, over the Ottawa Senators. In the <a href="2003%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">Stanley Cup Finals</a>, the Devils and <a href="Anaheim%20Ducks">Mighty Ducks of Anaheim</a> had a back-and-forth battle, as both teams won all of their home games. The Devils brought the Stanley Cup to New Jersey for a third time, defeating the Mighty Ducks in the seventh game of the Finals in New Jersey. After the series, Daneyko, a long-time fan favorite, announced his retirement. Brodeur was awarded the <a href="Vezina%20Trophy">Vezina Trophy</a> as outstanding goaltender in the regular season for the first time in his career, having won 41 games in the regular season to top the NHL.

In the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20NHL%20season">2003–04 season</a>, Brodeur took home the Vezina Trophy again. Despite losing team captain Scott Stevens in the 38th game of the season to a concussion, the Devils finished second in the Atlantic Division with 100 points. With the sixth seed in the <a href="2004%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs">Stanley Cup playoffs</a>, the Devils lost to the Philadelphia Flyers four games to one. In March 2004, near the end of the season, <a href="Lehman%20Brothers">Lehman Brothers</a> executive <a href="Jeffrey%20Vanderbeek">Jeff Vanderbeek</a> purchased a controlling interest from Puck Holdings and resigned from Lehman Brothers to assume full-time ownership. He had been a minority owner since the 2000 sale. Like Puck Holdings/YankeeNets, Vanderbeek largely left the Devils in Lamoriello's hands.

Vanderbeek was a strong proponent of the proposed arena in Newark, which first received funding from the city council during Puck Holdings' ownership in 2002. After legal battles over both <a href="eminent%20domain">eminent domain</a> and the city's financial participation in the arena project, the final deal was approved by council in October 2004, during the early months of the <a href="2004-05%20NHL%20lockout">lockout</a>, and the groundbreaking occurred almost exactly a year later. Nonetheless, in January 2006, financial issues threatened to halt the deal, as the Devils did not provide the city with a required letter of credit until the last possible day.
Though construction was well underway, in late summer 2006, new Mayor of Newark <a href="Cory%20Booker">Cory Booker</a> promised to reevaluate the deal and considered backing out. In October, Booker conceded there would be "a first-class arena built in the city of Newark, whether we like it or not," and soon after the Devils struck a deal including both property and monetary givebacks that appeased city officials. The arena, which was named the <a href="Prudential%20Center">Prudential Center</a> when Newark-based <a href="Prudential%20Financial">Prudential Financial</a> purchased naming rights in early 2007, opened shortly after the start of the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20NHL%20season">2007–08 season</a>.

The <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20NHL%20season">2004–05 season</a> was canceled due to the lockout; many Devils players played in European leagues and in the <a href="Ice%20Hockey%20World%20Championships">hockey world championships</a>. Patrik Elias, who was playing in the <a href="Russian%20Superleague">Russian Superleague</a>, contracted <a href="Hepatitis">hepatitis A</a>. Faced with Elias' indefinite recovery timetable, plus the loss of defensive stalwarts Scott Niedermayer to free agency and Scott Stevens to retirement, Lamoriello signed veteran defenseman <a href="Dan%20McGillis">Dan McGillis</a> and two former Devils, winger Alexander Mogilny and defenseman <a href="Vladimir%20Malakhov%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Vladimir Malakhov</a>, none of whom finished the season on the ice. In July 2005, the team announced that head coach <a href="Pat%20Burns">Pat Burns</a> would not return for the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20NHL%20season">2005–06 season</a> after being diagnosed with cancer for the second time in little more than a year. Assistant coach Larry Robinson, the team's head coach from 2000 to 2002, was promoted to start the season.

The Devils struggled early in the 2005–06 season, ending the 2005 calendar year with a 16–18–5 record. Robinson resigned as head coach on December 19, and Lamoriello moved down to the bench. Once Elias returned from his bout with hepatitis, the team quickly turned around, finishing 46–27–9 after a season-ending 11-game winning streak capped with a 4–3 win over the <a href="Montreal%20Canadiens">Montreal Canadiens</a>. During that final victory, which clinched the Devils' sixth division title, <a href="Brian%20Gionta">Brian Gionta</a> set a new team record for goals in a season with 48, topping Pat Verbeek's 46. The win streak to close the year was also an NHL record. The Devils won their Conference Quarterfinals playoff series against the Rangers four games to none, but were eliminated by the Carolina Hurricanes in the Conference Semifinals.

In the off-season, the Devils hired former Montreal Canadiens head coach <a href="Claude%20Julien%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Claude Julien</a> to replace Lamoriello behind the bench. However, in the last week of the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20New%20Jersey%20Devils%20season">2006–07 Devils season</a>, with just three games left, Julien was fired, and Lamoriello once again reprised his coaching role. The Devils went on to win their seventh Atlantic Division title and earn the second seed in the Eastern Conference after finishing ahead of the Pittsburgh Penguins by two points. They then defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning in six games in the Conference Quarterfinals, but fell to the Ottawa Senators in the Conference Semifinals in five. The conclusion of the series marked the end of the Devils' time at the Continental Airlines Arena.

Before the move to Newark, the Devils hired their 14th coach in a 26-season span, <a href="Brent%20Sutter">Brent Sutter</a>. As the Devils' pre-season came to an end, prospects <a href="Nicklas%20Bergfors">Nicklas Bergfors</a> and <a href="David%20Clarkson%20%28ice%20hockey%29">David Clarkson</a> made the final roster. The Devils opened their new arena, the <a href="Prudential%20Center">Prudential Center</a>, on October 27, 2007, against Ottawa after opening the season with a nine-game road trip. The game ended with a 4–1 win for Ottawa. In the last game of the 2007–08 season against the Rangers, the Devils won in a shootout, giving them home ice advantage over the Rangers in the playoffs. The Devils lost the series against the Rangers 4–1, losing all three games at home. Brodeur won the Vezina Trophy for the fourth time in five years for his performance in the regular season.

For the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20New%20Jersey%20Devils%20season">2008–09 season</a>, the Devils signed <a href="Brian%20Rolston">Brian Rolston</a> and Bobby Holik, both making their second stints with the team. The Devils were forced to play without Brodeur for over three months after he tore a biceps tendon in November, but strong play by backup goalie <a href="Scott%20Clemmensen">Scott Clemmensen</a> kept the Devils atop the Atlantic Division. After his return, Brodeur broke <a href="Patrick%20Roy">Patrick Roy</a>'s record for regular season wins on March 17, 2009, with his 552nd victory, while Patrik Elias became the franchise's all-time leading scorer with his 702nd point. The season also served as a break-out year for 24-year-old <a href="Zach%20Parise">Zach Parise</a>, who led the team with an impressive 45 goals and 94 points. In the Conference Quarterfinals of the <a href="2009%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs">2009 playoffs</a>, the Devils were eliminated in a Game 7 loss in which the Hurricanes scored two goals in the last minute and twenty seconds to erase a 3–2 Devils lead.

In the off-season, the Devils announced that Sutter was stepping down from his position, citing personal and family reasons; he became the coach of the <a href="Calgary%20Flames">Calgary Flames</a> shortly afterward. Jacques Lemaire returned to the head coach position. During the 2009–10 season, the Devils made a trade to acquire star left wing <a href="Ilya%20Kovalchuk">Ilya Kovalchuk</a> from the <a href="Atlanta%20Thrashers">Atlanta Thrashers</a>. The Devils had their 12th 100-point season in their last 15 attempts. They finished the season in first place in the Atlantic Division, second in the Eastern Conference, and played in the post-season for the 13th-straight time. Their seeding matched them up against Philadelphia in the Conference Quarterfinals, and they were eliminated four games to one.

After Lemaire retired from coaching, the Devils announced that the team's all-time leading scorer, John MacLean, would become their new head coach. During the off-season, the Devils signed Kovalchuk to a 15-year, $100 million contract, keeping him in New Jersey until the conclusion of the 2024–25 season; the move came after the NHL had rejected a 17-year contract for allegedly circumventing the <a href="NHL%20Collective%20Bargaining%20Agreement">NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement</a> (CBA). The League still penalized the Devils for trying to circumvent the <a href="NHL%20salary%20cap">NHL salary cap</a> with a money fine, a third-round draft pick in <a href="2011%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">2011</a> and one future first-round pick within the next four seasons. MacLean led the team to a record of 9–22–2, and after sitting in last place in the NHL on December 23, he was removed in favor of Lemaire, coming out of retirement for his third stint as head coach of the Devils and second in less than two seasons. Just a few days later, struggling captain Jamie Langenbrunner was traded back to Dallas after nine seasons with New Jersey. With the injured Parise missing most of the regular season, the team struggled offensively, finishing last in goals scored. Despite this, the Devils managed a mid-season turnaround, winning 22 out of the next 25 games. However, the Devils still failed to qualify for the playoffs for the first time since 1996, ending their 13-year streak.

In the 2011 off-season, Lemaire once again retired and was replaced by former Florida Panthers head coach <a href="Peter%20DeBoer">Peter DeBoer</a>. DeBoer's new system helped develop a strong offense, which had seven 40-point scorers by the season's end and broke an NHL record for the best regular season penalty kill since before the <a href="1967%20NHL%20Expansion">Expansion Era</a>. Four players – Kovalchuk, Elias, Clarkson and newly named captain Zach Parise – scored 30 or more goals, with Kovalchuk and Elias also finishing the season among the NHL's top ten-point scorers. Rookie forward <a href="Adam%20Henrique">Adam Henrique</a> totaled 51 points and earned a Calder Trophy nomination for rookie of the year. As the sixth seed in the <a href="2012%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs">Eastern Conference</a>, the Devils defeated <a href="Southeast%20Division%20%28NHL%29">Southeast</a> champions Florida before overcoming both divisional rivals, the Flyers and Rangers, to win the Conference and return to the Finals after nine years. Facing the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Kings">Los Angeles Kings</a> in the <a href="2012%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">Finals</a>, the Devils lost the first three games, but won the next two while facing elimination. In Game 6, the Kings defeated the Devils and captured the series.

During the 2012 off-season, Zach Parise signed a 13-year, $98 million contract with the <a href="Minnesota%20Wild">Minnesota Wild</a>, leaving the Devils after one season as team captain. The Devils entered the lockout-shortened season with <a href="Bryce%20Salvador">Bryce Salvador</a> as their new captain. However, the Devils failed to repeat the performance of the prior year, finishing 19–19–10 in 48 games and missed the playoffs.

The Devils' longtime financial struggles worsened during the 2012–13 season, and at one point the team needed to borrow $30 million to meet their payroll. This prompted owner Jeff Vanderbeek to sell the team. <a href="Andrew%20Barroway">Andrew Barroway</a>, the attorney who loaned the team the $30 million, was one potential buyer. Ultimately, the team was sold to <a href="Joshua%20Harris%20%28businessman%29">Josh Harris</a>, owner of the NBA's <a href="Philadelphia%2076ers">Philadelphia 76ers</a>, and <a href="David%20S.%20Blitzer">David S. Blitzer</a>, for over $320 million. The sale was formally announced on August 15, 2013. During the offseason, Kovalchuk announced he would retire from the NHL, expressing a desire to return home to Russia along with his family. In addition, 30-goal scorer Clarkson also left the Devils, signing a 7-year deal with Toronto. With the departures of Parise and now Kovalchuk and Clarkson, the Devils were in desperate need of offensive help. In an effort to full the void, the Devils signed veteran <a href="Jarom%C3%ADr%20J%C3%A1gr">Jaromir Jagr</a>, who despite being 41 years old, led the team scoring in the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20NHL%20season">2013–14 season</a>. During the <a href="2013%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">2013 NHL Entry Draft</a>, hosted in Newark, the Devils acquired goaltender <a href="Cory%20Schneider">Cory Schneider</a> from Vancouver in exchange for the Devils' first-round draft pick. Schneider split goaltending duties with the 41-year-old Brodeur, which led to some controversy over who should be the starting goalie for the Devils. Despite Schneider's 1.97 goals against average leading the NHL, the Devils missed the playoffs by five points due to lagging offensive production. In the 2014 offseason, the Devils saw the departure of NHL all-time wins leader Martin Brodeur, who was not re-signed and subsequently joined the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Blues">St. Louis Blues</a>. Brodeur, who had spent his entire 21-year career with the Devils, played only seven games with St. Louis before announcing his retirement.

The <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20NHL%20season">2014–15 season</a> opened with the Devils' roster suffering with injuries, and consequently the team accumulated losses. On December 26, Peter DeBoer was fired from the head coach position. To replace him, Lamoriello invested in two head coaches, former Devils player Scott Stevens (who had been DeBoer's assistant for two years) and <a href="Adam%20Oates">Adam Oates</a>, with Lamoriello himself supervising the team during the first months. The Devils finished the season as the sixth-worst team in the League, 20 points away from a playoff spot and with just one victory in the last 11 games.

During the 2015 offseason, <a href="Ray%20Shero">Ray Shero</a> was named the Devils' new general manager, and <a href="John%20Hynes%20%28ice%20hockey%29">John Hynes</a> was named as the new head coach. Lou Lamoriello resigned as team president and became the general manager of the <a href="Toronto%20Maple%20Leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a>, replacing <a href="Dave%20Nonis">Dave Nonis</a>, who was fired at the end of the season. In the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20NHL%20season">2015–16 season</a>, the Devils finished seventh in the Metropolitan Division with 84 points, missing the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season. The team finished in last place in the Eastern Conference the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20NHL%20season">following season</a> with 70 points; this was the first time that they finished last in the conference since the 1985–86 season. However, they won the ensuing draft lottery to secure the first overall selection in the <a href="2017%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">2017 NHL Entry Draft</a>, which they used to select <a href="Halifax%20Mooseheads">Halifax Mooseheads</a> center <a href="Nico%20Hischier">Nico Hischier</a>.

In the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20NHL%20season">2017–18 season</a>, the team recorded its best start in franchise history, going 9–2–0 in their first 11 games of the season. Forward <a href="Taylor%20Hall">Taylor Hall</a> set the franchise record for points in consecutive games, recording a point in 26 straight appearances. Hall finished the season sixth in the NHL in points (93) and earned nominations for the <a href="Hart%20Memorial%20Trophy">Hart Memorial Trophy</a> for the league's most valuable player and the <a href="Ted%20Lindsay%20Award">Ted Lindsay Award</a> for the NHL's most outstanding player. On the back of Hall's impressive performance and with aid from goaltender <a href="Keith%20Kinkaid">Keith Kinkaid</a> and rookie Hischier, the Devils clinched a playoff spot for the first time since the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20New%20Jersey%20Devils%20season">2011–12 season</a> with a win over the <a href="Toronto%20Maple%20Leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a>. The Devils' playoff run ended in the First Round where they lost 4–1 to the Tampa Bay Lightning in a seven-game series. After the conclusion of the playoffs, Hall became the first player in franchise history to win the Hart Memorial Trophy.

The team colors are red, black and white, and they can be seen on both the home and road jerseys. The home jersey, which was the team's road jersey until the NHL swapped home and road colors in 2003, is dominantly red in color. There are three black and white stripes, one across each arm and one across the waist. The road jersey (the team's former home jersey) is white in color with a similar design, except that the three stripes are black and red. The shoulders are draped with black on both uniforms. Before the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20New%20Jersey%20Devils%20season">1992–93</a> season, the uniforms were green and red with slightly different striping, leading some fans to affectionately refer to them as "Christmas colors." The Devils have yet to introduce a <a href="third%20jersey">third jersey</a> and are one of only two NHL teams (Detroit is the other) never to have worn one. Lamoriello had stated that he did not ever intend to introduce a third jersey for the Devils, saying, "I don't believe in it", Lamoriello said. "I strongly believe that you have to have one identity as a team. We want to create a feeling that our home and away jerseys are special and that it means something special to wear one." Unlike most teams, the Devils kept the same uniform design when the NHL switched to the jerseys by <a href="Reebok">Reebok</a> for the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20NHL%20season">2007–08 season</a>.

On August 20, 2009, Lamoriello announced that the Devils would wear their classic red, white and green jerseys on their <a href="Saint%20Patrick%27s%20Day">Saint Patrick's Day</a> 2010 game against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Lamoriello stated, "The original red, green and white jerseys are a part of our history here in New Jersey. We have always been an organization that takes great pride in its tradition. This is something we believe our fans will enjoy for that one special night." Martin Brodeur wore a special replica helmet of the one from his first NHL game. The throwback jerseys continued to be used, including for games on or around St. Patrick's Day over three different seasons and in the <a href="2014%20NHL%20Stadium%20Series">2014 NHL Stadium Series</a> against the Rangers, on January 26.

On June 20, 2017, the Devils revealed their new uniforms for the 2017–18 season. Made by Adidas, the new sweaters are the first major change to the team's look since they replaced green with black. They feature the removal of the stripes on the bottom of the sweater, and also thicker sleeve stripes with equal width bands of white and black.

The Devils will wear their classic white, red and green uniforms for four home games in the 2018–19 season. The uniforms will serve as the replacement for the red throwbacks the team wore from 2010–17.

The Devils' logo is a <a href="monogram">monogram</a> of the letters "N", and "J", rendered with devil horns at the top of the "J" and a pointed tail at the bottom. The monogram was red with a green outline when the team began playing in New Jersey, but the outline color was changed to black in 1992, due to difficulties in making the green color consistent between its logo and jerseys. The logo sits inside an open black circle, and lies on a field of white in the middle of the chest on both uniforms. Before the Devils' move from Colorado in 1982, then-owner John McMullen's wife designed a prototype logo, which was then modified by a professional graphic design and marketing firm, and became the green-and-red logo used by the team for the first ten years in New Jersey.

The mascot is "NJ Devil", a tall devil who plays into the myth of the <a href="Jersey%20Devil">Jersey Devil</a>. NJ Devil keeps the crowd excited, signs autographs, participates in entertainment during the intermissions, skates across the ice, throws T-shirts and runs throughout the aisles of the arena to high five fans. Prior to 1993, the mascot was "Slapshot", a large Devils <a href="hockey%20puck">hockey puck</a> that interacted with the fans. The man inside the costume resigned after he was accused of touching three women inappropriately while in costume. The man agreed to undergo psychological counseling for a year as part of his agreement to avoid trial. To remove the stigma of the lawsuit, Slapshot was retired and has not returned since.

<a href="Arlette%20Roxburgh">Arlette Roxburgh</a> has been the team's national anthem singer at home games since 1996 and is a favorite among the Devils fans. Starting in the 2018-19 season, when the lines, "And the rockets red glare" are sung, the fans shout out the word, "red", pertaining to the team's primary color.

Pete Cannarozzi has been the team's organist since 2001. His organ playing has helped keep the Devils tradition alive at both the <a href="Meadowlands%20Arena">Meadowlands Arena</a> and <a href="Prudential%20Center">Prudential Center</a>. He also accompanies Arlette during the national anthem.

Two of the rowdiest sections at Prudential Center is the 233 Crazies and the Diablos in Section 122. The Diablos were formed in 2011 entirely made of die-hard Devils fans when the management felt that they needed a supported energized boost. They are known to stand and cheer while the puck is in play and all wear Devils attire during all of the home games. The 233 Crazies were originally created in 1993 as the 228 Crazies when the Devils still played at the former Izod Center (which at the time was Brendan Byrne Arena, then Continental Airlines Arena). The 233 Crazies attend every Devils home game and some road games as well.

Mark Baumann, simply known to fans by his last name, Baumann, has been known to starting the D-E-V-I-L-S chant, dating back to 1995. He wears a white devils jersey with a number 00 on his back.

The Devils developed strong rivalries with two teams out of geographical proximity and frequent playoff confrontations. The <a href="Devils%E2%80%93Rangers%20rivalry">"Battle of the Hudson River"</a> with the New York Rangers is so-called as the Devils' arenas in the <a href="New%20York%20metropolitan%20area">New York metropolitan area</a> were always less than ten miles and across the Hudson River from <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden">Madison Square Garden</a>. New Jersey's proximity with Pennsylvania also led to a rivalry with the Philadelphia Flyers, the "<a href="Devils%E2%80%93Flyers%20rivalry">Battle of the Jersey Turnpike</a>." The Flyers have a large following in <a href="South%20Jersey">South Jersey</a> and train in <a href="Voorhees%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey">Voorhees Township</a>. Both teams had the most titles of the Atlantic Division prior to the 2013 realignment, with nine to the Devils and six to the Flyers.

The Devils have been known as a defense-first team since head coach Jacques Lemaire's first tenure, although the Devils have twice led the Eastern Conference in goals scored, once leading the NHL in goals scored (295 goals for in 2000–01). Lemaire gave the Devils their defensive mantra when he implemented a system commonly called the "<a href="neutral%20zone%20trap">neutral zone trap</a>." This system is designed to force teams to turn over the puck in the neutral zone leading to a counterattack. This style of play led the team to be chastised by the media and hockey purists for "making the NHL boring." Nevertheless, the Devils were successful using this style of play, and Devils head coach Larry Robinson asserted that the Montreal Canadiens teams he played on in the 1970s (who also won the Cup many times) used a form of the trap, though it did not have a name.

Under head coach Brent Sutter, the team adopted less of a trap and more of a transitional, aggressive forechecking style of play which also emphasized puck possession and instilled the cycle to start the 2007–08 season. This led to many high scoring games early in the season for New Jersey. The Devils went on to score 244 goals in the 2008–09 season, the most the team had scored in eight seasons. However, with the return of Lemaire as head coach, the Devils resumed a more defense-oriented playing style, scoring just 222 goals and allowing only 191, an NHL best in the 2009–10 season, earning Martin Brodeur his fifth <a href="William%20M.%20Jennings%20Trophy">William M. Jennings Trophy</a>.

Lemaire has since re-entered retirement, and was replaced by former Florida head coach Peter DeBoer on July 19, 2011. The team showed greater offensive prowess during the 2011–12 season, employing a more aggressive forecheck centered on Ilya Kovalchuk. Under DeBoer's system, according to Lamoriello, the Devils' defenseman were often sent into the offensive zone to apply pressure on the opposing team's defense. After DeBoer's dismissal, Adam Oates had a similar approach improving the Devils' offense, investing on the versatility of the forwards.

The Devils have retired five numbers, all representing key players on their three Stanley Cup-winning teams in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
Notes:

Twelve Devils players have been inducted into the <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a>. <a href="Peter%20%C5%A0%C5%A5astn%C3%BD">Peter Stastny</a>, who played for the Devils from 1989 to 1993, was inducted in 1998. A center who defected from Czechoslovakia, Stastny was one of the NHL's top goal scorers in the 1980s. In 2001, Stastny was joined in the Hall of Fame by Devils defenseman <a href="Viacheslav%20Fetisov">Viacheslav Fetisov</a>, who was one of the first Soviet players in the NHL. Fetisov played for the team in the 1989–90 season and again from 1990 to 1995. <a href="Scott%20Stevens">Scott Stevens</a>, a Devils defenseman from 1991 to 2004 and long-time team captain, was inducted in 2007 in his first year of eligibility. In December 2014, Stevens returned as head coach for the Devils' defense. <a href="Igor%20Larionov">Igor Larionov</a>, a forward with a 15-year career in the NHL who spent the 2003–04 season with the Devils, was inducted in 2008.

Tasha Yar

Natasha "Tasha" Yar is a <a href="fictional%20character">fictional character</a> that mainly appeared in the of the American <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> television series "". Portrayed by <a href="Denise%20Crosby">Denise Crosby</a>, Yar is chief of security aboard the <a href="Starfleet">Starfleet</a> starship <a href="USS%20Enterprise%20%28NCC-1701-D%29">USS "Enterprise"-D</a> and carries the rank of lieutenant. The character's concept was originally based upon the character of <a href="Jenette%20Goldstein">Vasquez</a> from the film "<a href="Aliens%20%28film%29">Aliens</a>" (1986). Following further development she became known first as Tanya, and then Tasha. Crosby had originally auditioned for the role of <a href="Deanna%20Troi">Deanna Troi</a>, while <a href="Rosalind%20Chao">Rosalind Chao</a> became a favorite for Tasha. After <a href="Marina%20Sirtis">Marina Sirtis</a> auditioned for the role, the series' creator <a href="Gene%20Roddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a> decided to switch the roles for the actresses, with Sirtis becoming Troi and Crosby becoming Yar. Chao would later appear on the series in a recurring role as <a href="Keiko%20O%27Brien">Keiko O'Brien</a>.

The character first appeared in the series' pilot episode, "<a href="Encounter%20at%20Farpoint">Encounter at Farpoint</a>". After Crosby decided to leave the series, Yar was killed in the episode "<a href="Skin%20of%20Evil">Skin of Evil</a>" near the end of the series' . She was written back into the series for a guest appearance in the episode "<a href="Yesterday%27s%20Enterprise">Yesterday's Enterprise</a>", in which her character was still alive in an alternate timeline, and again in the final episode of the series "", which included events set prior to the pilot.

She was described as a forerunner to other strong women in science fiction, such as <a href="Kara%20Thrace">Kara Thrace</a> from the 2004 version of "<a href="Battlestar%20Galactica%20%282004%20TV%20series%29">Battlestar Galactica</a>", while providing a step between the appearances of female characters on "" to the command positions they have on "" and "". Questions were raised over the sexuality of the character, and it was thought that the events in the episode "<a href="The%20Naked%20Now">The Naked Now</a>" were designed to establish her heterosexuality. The manner of her first death was received with mostly negative reviews. One critic called it typical of the death of a "Star Trek" security officer, and the scene was also included in a list of tasteless sci-fi deaths.

Inspired by Vasquez in "<a href="Aliens%20%28film%29">Aliens</a>", the character was initially named "Macha Hernandez" and was the tactical officer of the "<a href="USS%20Enterprise%20%28NCC-1701-D%29">Enterprise</a>". This had been changed by the first casting call—issued on December 10, 1986—when she was given the position of security chief. The producers considered <a href="Jenette%20Goldstein">Jenette Goldstein</a>, who had played Vasquez, for the role, but writer <a href="Dorothy%20Fontana">Dorothy Fontana</a> pointed out that the actress "is not Latina. She is petite, blue-eyed, freckle-faced". The character was subsequently renamed "Tanya" around March 13.
By the time that the writers' and directors' guide for the series was published, dated March 23, 1987, the character was named Natasha "Tasha" Yar. Her surname was suggested by <a href="Robert%20Lewin%20%28filmmaker%29">Robert Lewin</a>, drawing inspiration from the <a href="Babi%20Yar">Babi Yar</a> atrocities in Ukraine during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. Her biography stated that she was 28 years old, and confirmed her Ukrainian descent. She was planned to have a friendship with teenager <a href="Wesley%20Crusher">Wesley Crusher</a>, and was described in the guide as "treat[ing] this boy like the most wonderful person imaginable. Wes is the childhood friend that Tasha never had."

In April 1987, Lianne Langland, <a href="Julia%20Nickson-Soul">Julia Nickson</a>, <a href="Rosalind%20Chao">Rosalind Chao</a>, <a href="Leah%20Ayres">Leah Ayres</a> and <a href="Bunty%20Bailey">Bunty Bailey</a> were each listed as being in contention for the role. Chao was a favorite candidate, while <a href="Denise%20Crosby">Denise Crosby</a> was described as "the only possibility" for the character of <a href="Deanna%20Troi">Deanna Troi</a>. The production staff were not keen on having two actresses in the bridge crew roles with similar physical types and hair colors, and so the team took account of the casting of the two roles together. The writers and directors guide described Yar as having a muscular but very feminine body type, and being sufficiently athletic to defeat most other crew members in martial arts. After Crosby and <a href="Marina%20Sirtis">Marina Sirtis</a> had each auditioned for Troi and Yar respectively, <a href="Gene%20Roddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a> decided to switch the actresses and cast Crosby as Tasha Yar. He felt that Sirtis' appearance was better suited to the "exotic" Troi.

Before the end of the first season, Crosby asked to be released from her contract as she was unhappy that her character was not being developed. She later said "I was miserable. I couldn't wait to get off that show. I was dying". Roddenberry agreed to her request and she left on good terms. The final episode she filmed was "", which was completed after Yar's death in "<a href="Skin%20of%20Evil">Skin of Evil</a>". Her last scene was during the final act of the episode, in which a holographic farewell recording of her is played for the bridge crew. After her departure, archive footage of Crosby as Yar was used in the episodes "" and "".

Crosby was happy to return in "<a href="Yesterday%27s%20Enterprise">Yesterday's Enterprise</a>" due to the strength of the script, saying that "I had more to do in that episode than I'd ever had to do before". Prior to the episode being aired, the media had to be reassured that Yar was not returning in a <a href="dream%20sequence">dream sequence</a>. Following her appearance in that episode, Crosby pitched the idea of Yar's daughter, <a href="Sela%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Sela</a>, to the producers. She made her first appearance in this role in the two-part "" and appeared once more in another two-part episode, "". Denise returned twice more in the non-canon "Star Trek" universe. In 2007, she appeared as an ancestor of Tasha Yar, Jenna Yar, in "", an episode of the fan-produced series "". Tasha Yar was written into "<a href="Star%20Trek%20Online">Star Trek Online</a>" as part of the third anniversary celebration in 2013. Denise Crosby recorded audio for the game, in scenes set after those in "Yesterday's Enterprise".

Natasha Yar's origins are explained in the season four episode "". She was born on the planet Turkana IV in 2337. She had a younger sister named <a href="Ishara%20Yar">Ishara</a> (<a href="Beth%20Toussaint">Beth Toussaint</a>), who was born five years after her. Shortly after Ishara's birth, the girls' parents were killed and they were taken in by other people. However, they were subsequently abandoned and Tasha was required to look after her sister on her own. The government on the planet had collapsed, and the sisters were forced to scavenge for food while avoiding rape gangs. In 2352, aged 15, Tasha managed to leave Turkana IV. She never saw Ishara again; the latter joined the "Coalition", one of the factions on the planet before Tasha left. Tasha refused to join the <a href="cadres">cadres</a> on the planet, blaming them for her parent's deaths.

Yar appeared for the first time in the pilot episode of "" as the Security and Tactical Officer on board the USS "Enterprise"-D. When <a href="Jean-Luc%20Picard">Captain Picard</a> (<a href="Patrick%20Stewart">Patrick Stewart</a>) orders an emergency saucer separation, Yar is one of the bridge crew to accompany him to the <a href="battle%20bridge">battle bridge</a>. She is amongst the crew abducted by <a href="Q%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Q</a> (<a href="John%20de%20Lancie">John de Lancie</a>), and later serves on the away team to Farpoint Station. In "<a href="The%20Naked%20Now">The Naked Now</a>", while the crew are under the influence of an alien ailment, she initiates a sexual encounter with the android <a href="Data%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Data</a> (<a href="Brent%20Spiner">Brent Spiner</a>). In "" Yar is abducted by Lutan (<a href="Jessie%20Lawrence%20Ferguson">Jessie Lawrence Ferguson</a>), the leader of the planet Ligon II, after she demonstrates her combat skills on the <a href="holodeck">holodeck</a>. She defeats Lutan's wife Yareena in ritual combat. Yareena is revived on the "Enterprise" by Doctor <a href="Beverly%20Crusher">Crusher</a> (<a href="Gates%20McFadden">Gates McFadden</a>). During the events of "<a href="Where%20No%20One%20Has%20Gone%20Before">Where No One Has Gone Before</a>", Yar begins to hallucinate that she is back on Turkana IV and running for her life. In "<a href="The%20Arsenal%20of%20Freedom">The Arsenal of Freedom</a>", Yar and Data are trapped together on the surface of the planet Minos and are attacked by a series of sentry probes that adapt to Data and Yar's phasers. The situation is resolved by Captain Picard, who is trapped elsewhere on the planet's surface with Dr. Crusher.

Yar forms part of the away team that <a href="Transporter%20%28Star%20Trek%29">beams</a> down to Vagra II to rescue Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) from a crashed shuttlecraft in "<a href="Skin%20of%20Evil">Skin of Evil</a>". She is killed by the creature Armus (<a href="Mart%20McChesney">Mart McChesney</a> and <a href="Ron%20Gans">Ron Gans</a>) in a display of his power. The crew hold a memorial service for her on the holodeck, and <a href="Worf">Worf</a> (<a href="Michael%20Dorn">Michael Dorn</a>) replaces her as chief tactical and security officer. After her death it is revealed that Data keeps a small hologram of her in his quarters. Despite Data's lack of emotions, he is described by reviewers as being sentimentally attached to her image. During the court hearing on Data's stature as a sentient being in "", he explains that he and Yar were intimate and that she was special to him.

After the <a href="USS%20Enterprise%20%28NCC-1701-C%29">USS "Enterprise"-C</a> emerges from a rift in space-time in "Yesterday's Enterprise", the timeline is changed and Yar is once again alive and in her former position on the "Enterprise"-D. She works with the older Enterprise's helmsman, <a href="Richard%20Castillo%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Richard Castillo</a> (<a href="Christopher%20McDonald">Christopher McDonald</a>), and the two become close. <a href="Guinan%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Guinan</a> (<a href="Whoopi%20Goldberg">Whoopi Goldberg</a>), who has some awareness of the timeline that would be restored by the "Enterprise"-C returning into the rift, confides in Yar that she believes that Yar died senselessly in that timeline. Based on that advice, Yar transfers to the "Enterprise"-C and returns with it to two decades into the past, and its expected destruction at the hands of the <a href="Romulan">Romulan</a>s while defending the <a href="Klingon">Klingon</a> outpost Narendra III. The alternative universe version of Yar travelled back in time on board the "Enterprise"-C, and into the main timeline. This process was later described as "world jumping" rather than a typical timeline travel story by critics.

Yar's half-Romulan daughter <a href="Sela%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Sela</a> explains in "Redemption" that several members of the "Enterprise"-C crew were captured by the Romulans when it returned through the rift, including Yar. A Romulan general offered to spare the crew's lives if she became his consort. After a year, Yar gave birth to Sela. When Sela was four, Yar attempted to escape but Sela screamed to prevent her from being taken away from her father. After she was caught, Yar was executed.

The series finale "" includes Yar's final appearance, in scenes that take place prior to and in the early parts of "<a href="Encounter%20at%20Farpoint">Encounter at Farpoint</a>". As most of the bridge crew are yet to join the "Enterprise"-D in the scenes, Yar is one of the senior members of the crew under Captain Picard in the earliest of the three timeframes in the episode. She needs to be convinced by Picard to put the ship in danger in order to destroy the temporal anomaly that threatens to prevent life from evolving on Earth.

Science fiction writer <a href="Keith%20DeCandido">Keith DeCandido</a> considered Yar the most interesting role to appear in the "writer's bible", while Hal Boedeker characterized her as "forceful" in an article on women in "Star Trek" for "<a href="Knight%20Ridder">Knight Ridder</a>". A <a href="Den%20of%20Geek">Den of Geek</a> article by Martin Anderson also about women in "Star Trek" described the character as a predecessor to <a href="Kara%20Thrace">Kara "Starbuck" Thrace</a> in the 2004 re-imagining of "<a href="Battlestar%20Galactica%20%282004%20TV%20series%29">Battlestar Galactica</a>". A "<a href="Post-Tribune">Post-Tribune</a>" review of the series following the pilot described Yar as a "tough cookie" and the reviewer's favorite crew member. Frank Oglesbee, in his article on "" <a href="Kira%20Nerys">Kira Nerys</a>, outlined the progression of female roles in "gender assumptions" from "" where women were on the bridge, through Tasha Yar in "The Next Generation" where they were in command positions, to "Deep Space Nine" and "" where women were in lead roles. He noted specifically that women appeared in command positions more regularly as main and supporting characters, and were portrayed as more assertive and combative, with leading roles in action sequences.

In Sarah Projansky's contribution on rape in "Star Trek" to the book "Enterprise Zones: Critical Positions on Star Trek", she extrapolates that Yar's introduction to <a href="Starfleet">Starfleet</a> was similar to the actions of <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> soldiers issuing supplies to the survivors of the <a href="atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a> and the liberation of <a href="Nazi%20concentration%20camps">Nazi concentration camps</a> during the Second World War. The idea of an American savior of colonial rape victims stems from U.S. propaganda during the war, stating that "In "TNG", the <a href="United%20Federation%20of%20Planets">Federation</a> citizen represents a new and improved version of this U.S. savior citizen; the Federation citizen is a post-nationalist, post-sexist, and post-racist soldier—feminist".

Reviewers have questioned the character's sexuality since the end of the series. <a href="Curve%20%28magazine%29">"Curve"</a> magazine speculated that Yar was a "closeted" lesbian. In the book "Science Fiction Audiences: Watching <a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a> and Star Trek", the authors describe her as "an obvious bisexual", but that "she should be a lesbian". Referring to the events in "The Naked Now", the authors explain "when they decided to straighten her, they used an android. So we ended up heterosexualizing two perfectly wonderful characters". The authors of the book "Deep Space and Sacred Time: Star Trek in the American Mythos" also thought that having Data and Yar consummate sexually was a means to state early on in the series the heterosexuality of the two most <a href="androgynous">androgynous</a> characters in the show.

Fans responded negatively to the departure of Yar as they felt that the character had potential for future expansion. Reviewers were also critical of the manner of Yar's death. Keith DeCandido called it "pointless", but thought that it was no worse than the deaths of other security officer "<a href="Redshirt%20%28character%29">redshirts</a>" throughout the history of "Star Trek". He said that he preferred her death in "Skin of Evil" to the "clichéd-up-the-wazoo" death she experienced in "Yesterday's Enterprise". Gary Westfahl, in his book "Space and Beyond: The Frontier Theme in Science Fiction", described Yar's death as one of the most notable ones in "Star Trek", alongside that of <a href="Spock">Spock</a> in "" and <a href="James%20T.%20Kirk">James T. Kirk</a> in "<a href="Star%20Trek%20Generations">Star Trek Generations</a>". <a href="SFX%20%28magazine%29">"SFX"</a> magazine included her first death in a 2012 list of the top 21 "Naff Sci-Fi Deaths", while the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>" described her death in "Yesterday's Enterprise" as a "hero's death".

Conservation of energy

In physics and chemistry, the law of conservation of energy states that the total <a href="energy">energy</a> <a href="isolated%20system">isolated system</a> remains constant; it is said to be <a href="Conservation%20law">"conserved"</a> over time. This law means that energy can neither be created nor destroyed; rather, it can only be transformed or transferred from one form to another. For instance, <a href="chemical%20energy">chemical energy</a> is <a href="Energy%20conversion">converted</a> to <a href="kinetic%20energy">kinetic energy</a> when a stick of <a href="dynamite">dynamite</a> explodes. If one adds up all the forms of energy that were released in the explosion, such as the <a href="kinetic%20energy">kinetic energy</a> and <a href="potential%20energy">potential energy</a> of the pieces, as well as heat and sound, one will get the exact decrease of chemical energy in the combustion of the dynamite. Classically, conservation of energy was distinct from conservation of mass; however, <a href="special%20relativity">special relativity</a> showed that mass is related to energy and vice versa by "E = mc", and science now takes the view that mass–energy is conserved.

Conservation of energy can be rigorously proven by <a href="Noether%27s%20theorem">Noether's theorem</a> as a consequence of <a href="Continuous%20function">continuous</a> <a href="time%20translation%20symmetry">time translation symmetry</a>; that is, from the fact that the laws of physics do not change over time.

A consequence of the law of conservation of energy is that a <a href="Perpetual%20motion%23Classification">perpetual motion machine of the first kind</a> cannot exist, that is to say, no system without an external energy supply can deliver an unlimited amount of energy to its surroundings. For systems which do not have <a href="time%20translation%20symmetry">time translation symmetry</a>, it may not be possible to define conservation of energy. Examples include <a href="curved%20space">curved space</a>times in <a href="general%20relativity">general relativity</a> or <a href="time%20crystals">time crystals</a> in <a href="condensed%20matter%20physics">condensed matter physics</a>.

<a href="Ancient">Ancient</a> <a href="philosopher">philosopher</a>s as far back as <a href="Thales%20of%20Miletus">Thales of Miletus</a>  550 BCE had inklings of the conservation of some underlying substance of which everything is made. However, there is no particular reason to identify this with what we know today as "mass-energy" (for example, Thales thought it was water). <a href="Empedocles">Empedocles</a> (490–430 BCE) wrote that in this universal system, composed of <a href="Classical%20element">four roots</a> (earth, air, water, fire), "nothing comes to be or perishes"; instead, these elements suffer continual rearrangement.

In 1605, <a href="Simon%20Stevinus">Simon Stevinus</a> was able to solve a number of problems in statics based on the principle that <a href="perpetual%20motion">perpetual motion</a> was impossible.

In 1639, <a href="Galileo%20Galilei">Galileo</a> published his analysis of several situations—including the celebrated "interrupted pendulum"—which can be described (in modern language) as conservatively converting potential energy to kinetic energy and back again. Essentially, he pointed out that the height a moving body rises is equal to the height from which it falls, and used this observation to infer the idea of inertia. The remarkable aspect of this observation is that the height to which a moving body ascends on a frictionless surface does not depend on the shape of the surface.

In 1669, <a href="Christiaan%20Huygens">Christiaan Huygens</a> published his laws of collision. Among the quantities he listed as being invariant before and after the collision of bodies were both the sum of their linear momentums as well as the sum of their kinetic energies. However, the difference between elastic and inelastic collision was not understood at the time. This led to the dispute among later researchers as to which of these conserved quantities was the more fundamental. In his "<a href="Horologium%20Oscillatorium">Horologium Oscillatorium</a>", he gave a much clearer statement regarding the height of ascent of a moving body, and connected this idea with the impossibility of a perpetual motion. Huygens' study of the dynamics of pendulum motion was based on a single principle: that the center of gravity of a heavy object cannot lift itself.

The fact that kinetic energy is scalar, unlike linear momentum which is a vector, and hence easier to work with did not escape the attention of <a href="Gottfried%20Wilhelm%20Leibniz">Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</a>. It was Leibniz during 1676–1689 who first attempted a mathematical formulation of the kind of energy which is connected with "motion" (kinetic energy). Using Huygens' work on collision, Leibniz noticed that in many mechanical systems (of several <a href="mass">mass</a>es, "m" each with <a href="velocity">velocity</a> "v"),

was conserved so long as the masses did not interact. He called this quantity the "<a href="vis%20viva">vis viva</a>" or "living force" of the system. The principle represents an accurate statement of the approximate conservation of <a href="kinetic%20energy">kinetic energy</a> in situations where there is no friction. Many <a href="physicist">physicist</a>s at that time, such as Newton, held that the <a href="conservation%20of%20momentum">conservation of momentum</a>, which holds even in systems with friction, as defined by the <a href="momentum">momentum</a>:

was the conserved "vis viva". It was later shown that both quantities are conserved simultaneously, given the proper conditions such as an <a href="elastic%20collision">elastic collision</a>.

In 1687, <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a> published his "<a href="Philosophi%C3%A6%20Naturalis%20Principia%20Mathematica">Principia</a>", which was organized around the concept of force and momentum. However, the researchers were quick to recognize that the principles set out in the book, while fine for point masses, were not sufficient to tackle the motions of rigid and fluid bodies. Some other principles were also required.

The law of conservation of vis viva was championed by the father and son duo, <a href="Johann%20Bernoulli">Johann</a> and <a href="Daniel%20Bernoulli">Daniel Bernoulli</a>. The former enunciated the principle of <a href="virtual%20work">virtual work</a> as used in statics in its full generality in 1715, while the latter based his "<a href="Hydrodynamica">Hydrodynamica</a>", published in 1738, on this single conservation principle. Daniel's study of loss of vis viva of flowing water led him to formulate the <a href="Bernoulli%27s%20principle">Bernoulli's principle</a>, which relates the loss to be proportional to the change in hydrodynamic pressure. Daniel also formulated the notion of work and efficiency for hydraulic machines; and he gave a kinetic theory of gases, and linked the kinetic energy of gas molecules with the temperature of the gas.

This focus on the vis viva by the continental physicists eventually led to the discovery of stationarity principles governing mechanics, such as the <a href="D%27Alembert%27s%20principle">D'Alembert's principle</a>, <a href="Lagrangian%20mechanics">Lagrangian</a>,
and <a href="Hamiltonian%20mechanics">Hamiltonian</a> formulations of mechanics.

<a href="%C3%89milie%20du%20Ch%C3%A2telet">Émilie du Châtelet</a> (1706 – 1749) proposed and tested the hypothesis of the conservation of total energy, as distinct from momentum. Inspired by the theories of Gottfried Leibniz, she repeated and publicized an experiment originally devised by <a href="Willem%20%27s%20Gravesande">Willem 's Gravesande</a> in 1722 in which balls were dropped from different heights into a sheet of soft clay. Each ball's kinetic energy - as indicated by the quantity of material displaced - was shown to be proportional to the square of the velocity. The deformation of the clay was found to be directly proportional to the height the balls were dropped from, equal to the initial potential energy. Earlier workers, including Newton and Voltaire, had all believed that "energy" (so far as they understood the concept at all) was not distinct from momentum and therefore proportional to velocity. According to this understanding, the deformation of the clay should have been proportional to the square root of the height from which the balls were dropped from. In classical physics the correct formula is formula_3, where formula_4 is the kinetic energy of an object, formula_5 its mass and formula_6 its speed. On this basis, Châtelet proposed that energy must always have the same dimensions in any form, which is necessary to be able to relate it in different forms (kinetic, potential, heat…).

<a href="Engineer">Engineer</a>s such as <a href="John%20Smeaton">John Smeaton</a>, <a href="Peter%20Ewart">Peter Ewart</a>, , <a href="Gustave-Adolphe%20Hirn">Gustave-Adolphe Hirn</a> and <a href="Marc%20Seguin">Marc Seguin</a> recognized that conservation of momentum alone was not adequate for practical calculation and made use of Leibniz's principle. The principle was also championed by some <a href="chemist">chemist</a>s such as <a href="William%20Hyde%20Wollaston">William Hyde Wollaston</a>. Academics such as <a href="John%20Playfair">John Playfair</a> were quick to point out that kinetic energy is clearly not conserved. This is obvious to a modern analysis based on the <a href="second%20law%20of%20thermodynamics">second law of thermodynamics</a>, but in the 18th and 19th centuries the fate of the lost energy was still unknown.

Gradually it came to be suspected that the heat inevitably generated by motion under friction was another form of "vis viva". In 1783, <a href="Antoine%20Lavoisier">Antoine Lavoisier</a> and <a href="Pierre-Simon%20Laplace">Pierre-Simon Laplace</a> reviewed the two competing theories of "vis viva" and <a href="caloric%20theory">caloric theory</a>. <a href="Benjamin%20Thompson">Count Rumford</a>'s 1798 observations of heat generation during the <a href="Boring%20%28manufacturing%29">boring</a> of <a href="cannon">cannon</a>s added more weight to the view that mechanical motion could be converted into heat, and (as importantly) that the conversion was quantitative and could be predicted (allowing for a universal conversion constant between kinetic energy and heat). "Vis viva" then started to be known as "energy", after the term was first used in that sense by <a href="Thomas%20Young%20%28scientist%29">Thomas Young</a> in 1807.

The recalibration of "vis viva" to

which can be understood as converting kinetic energy to <a href="Work%20%28thermodynamics%29">work</a>, was largely the result of <a href="Gaspard-Gustave%20Coriolis">Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis</a> and <a href="Jean-Victor%20Poncelet">Jean-Victor Poncelet</a> over the period 1819–1839. The former called the quantity "quantité de travail" (quantity of work) and the latter, "travail mécanique" (mechanical work), and both championed its use in engineering calculation.

In a paper "Über die Natur der Wärme"(German "On the Nature of Heat/Warmth"), published in the "<a href="Zeitschrift%20f%C3%BCr%20Physik">Zeitschrift für Physik</a>" in 1837, <a href="Karl%20Friedrich%20Mohr">Karl Friedrich Mohr</a> gave one of the earliest general statements of the doctrine of the conservation of energy in the words: "besides the 54 known chemical elements there is in the physical world one agent only, and this is called "Kraft" [energy or work]. It may appear, according to circumstances, as motion, chemical affinity, cohesion, electricity, light and magnetism; and from any one of these forms it can be transformed into any of the others."

A key stage in the development of the modern conservation principle was the demonstration of the "<a href="mechanical%20equivalent%20of%20heat">mechanical equivalent of heat</a>". The <a href="caloric%20theory">caloric theory</a> maintained that heat could neither be created nor destroyed, whereas conservation of energy entails the contrary principle that heat and mechanical work are interchangeable.

In the middle of the eighteenth century, <a href="Mikhail%20Lomonosov">Mikhail Lomonosov</a>, a Russian scientist, postulated his corpusculo-kinetic theory of heat, which rejected the idea of a caloric. Through the results of empirical studies, Lomonosov came to the conclusion that heat was not transferred through the particles of the caloric fluid.

In 1798, Count Rumford (<a href="Benjamin%20Thompson">Benjamin Thompson</a>) performed measurements of the frictional heat generated in boring cannons, and developed the idea that heat is a form of kinetic energy; his measurements refuted caloric theory, but were imprecise enough to leave room for doubt.

The mechanical equivalence principle was first stated in its modern form by the German surgeon <a href="Julius%20Robert%20von%20Mayer">Julius Robert von Mayer</a> in 1842. Mayer reached his conclusion on a voyage to the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>, where he found that his patients' blood was a deeper red because they were consuming less <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>, and therefore less energy, to maintain their body temperature in the hotter climate. He discovered that <a href="heat">heat</a> and <a href="mechanical%20work">mechanical work</a> were both forms of energy and in 1845, after improving his knowledge of physics, he published a monograph that stated a quantitative relationship between them.

Meanwhile, in 1843, <a href="James%20Prescott%20Joule">James Prescott Joule</a> independently discovered the mechanical equivalent in a series of experiments. In the most famous, now called the "Joule apparatus", a descending weight attached to a string caused a paddle immersed in water to rotate. He showed that the gravitational <a href="potential%20energy">potential energy</a> lost by the weight in descending was equal to the <a href="internal%20energy">internal energy</a> gained by the water through <a href="friction">friction</a> with the paddle.

Over the period 1840–1843, similar work was carried out by engineer <a href="Ludwig%20A.%20Colding">Ludwig A. Colding</a>, although it was little known outside his native Denmark.

Both Joule's and Mayer's work suffered from resistance and neglect but it was Joule's that eventually drew the wider recognition.

In 1844, <a href="William%20Robert%20Grove">William Robert Grove</a> postulated a relationship between mechanics, heat, <a href="light">light</a>, <a href="electricity">electricity</a> and <a href="magnetism">magnetism</a> by treating them all as manifestations of a single "force" ("energy" in modern terms). In 1846, Grove published his theories in his book "The Correlation of Physical Forces". In 1847, drawing on the earlier work of Joule, <a href="Nicolas%20L%C3%A9onard%20Sadi%20Carnot">Sadi Carnot</a> and <a href="%C3%89mile%20Clapeyron">Émile Clapeyron</a>, <a href="Hermann%20von%20Helmholtz">Hermann von Helmholtz</a> arrived at conclusions similar to Grove's and published his theories in his book "Über die Erhaltung der Kraft" ("On the Conservation of Force", 1847). The general modern acceptance of the principle stems from this publication.

In 1850, <a href="William%20Rankine">William Rankine</a> first used the phrase "the law of the conservation of energy" for the principle.

In 1877, <a href="Peter%20Guthrie%20Tait">Peter Guthrie Tait</a> claimed that the principle originated with Sir Isaac Newton, based on a creative reading of propositions 40 and 41 of the "<a href="Philosophiae%20Naturalis%20Principia%20Mathematica">Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica</a>". This is now regarded as an example of <a href="Whig%20history">Whig history</a>.

Matter is composed of such things as atoms, electrons, neutrons, and protons. It has <a href="rest%20mass">"intrinsic" or "rest" mass</a>. In the limited range of recognized experience of the nineteenth century it was found that such rest mass is conserved. Einstein's 1905 theory of <a href="special%20relativity">special relativity</a> showed that it corresponds to an equivalent amount of "rest energy". This means that it can be converted to or from equivalent amounts of "other" (non-material) forms of energy, for example kinetic energy, potential energy, and electromagnetic radiant energy. When this happens, as recognized in twentieth century experience, rest mass is not conserved, unlike the <a href="mass%20in%20special%20relativity">"total" mass</a> or "total" energy. All forms of energy contribute to the total mass and total energy.

For example, an <a href="electron">electron</a> and a <a href="positron">positron</a> each have rest mass. They can perish together, converting their combined rest energy into <a href="photon">photon</a>s having electromagnetic radiant energy, but no rest mass. If this occurs within an isolated system that does not release the photons or their energy into the external surroundings, then neither the total "mass" nor the total "energy" of the system will change. The produced electromagnetic radiant energy contributes just as much to the inertia (and to any weight) of the system as did the rest mass of the electron and positron before their demise. Likewise, non-material forms of energy can perish into matter, which has rest mass.

Thus, conservation of energy ("total", including material or "rest" energy), and <a href="conservation%20of%20mass">conservation of mass</a> ("total", not just "rest"), each still holds as an (equivalent) law. In the 18th century these had appeared as two seemingly-distinct laws.

The discovery in 1911 that electrons emitted in <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a> have a continuous rather than a discrete spectrum appeared to contradict conservation of energy, under the then-current assumption that beta decay is the simple emission of an electron from a nucleus. This problem was eventually resolved in 1933 by <a href="Enrico%20Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a> who proposed the correct <a href="Fermi%27s%20interaction">description of beta-decay</a> as the emission of both an electron and an <a href="antineutrino">antineutrino</a>, which carries away the apparently missing energy.

For a <a href="Closed%20system%23In%20thermodynamics">closed thermodynamic system</a>, the first law of thermodynamics may be stated as:

where formula_10 is the quantity of <a href="energy">energy</a> added to the system by a <a href="heat">heat</a>ing process, formula_11 is the quantity of energy lost by the system due to <a href="Work%20%28thermodynamics%29">work</a> done by the system on its surroundings and formula_12 is the change in the <a href="internal%20energy">internal energy</a> of the system.

The δ's before the heat and work terms are used to indicate that they describe an increment of energy which is to be interpreted somewhat differently than the formula_12 increment of internal energy (see <a href="Inexact%20differential">Inexact differential</a>). Work and heat refer to kinds of process which add or subtract energy to or from a system, while the internal energy formula_14 is a property of a particular state of the system when it is in unchanging thermodynamic equilibrium. Thus the term "heat energy" for formula_10 means "that amount of energy added as the result of heating" rather than referring to a particular form of energy. Likewise, the term "work energy" for formula_11 means "that amount of energy lost as the result of work". Thus one can state the amount of internal energy possessed by a thermodynamic system that one knows is presently in a given state, but one cannot tell, just from knowledge of the given present state, how much energy has in the past flowed into or out of the system as a result of its being heated or cooled, nor as the result of work being performed on or by the system.

<a href="Entropy%20%28classical%20thermodynamics%29">Entropy</a> is a function of the state of a system which tells of limitations of the possibility of conversion of heat into work.

For a simple compressible system, the work performed by the system may be written:

where formula_18 is the <a href="pressure">pressure</a> and formula_19 is a small change in the <a href="volume">volume</a> of the system, each of which are system variables. In the fictive case in which the process is idealized and infinitely slow, so as to be called "quasi-static", and regarded as reversible, the heat being transferred from a source with temperature infinitesimally above the system temperature, then the heat energy may be written

where formula_21 is the <a href="temperature">temperature</a> and formula_22 is a small change in the <a href="entropy">entropy</a> of the system. Temperature and entropy are variables of state of a system.

If an open system (in which mass may be exchanged with the environment) has several walls such that the mass transfer is through rigid walls separate from the heat and work transfers, then the first law may be written:

where formula_24 is the added mass and formula_25 is the internal energy per unit mass of the added mass, measured in the surroundings before the process.

The conservation of energy is a common feature in many physical theories. From a mathematical point of view it is understood as a consequence of <a href="Noether%27s%20theorem">Noether's theorem</a>, developed by <a href="Emmy%20Noether">Emmy Noether</a> in 1915 and first published in 1918. The theorem states every continuous symmetry of a physical theory has an associated conserved quantity; if the theory's symmetry is time invariance then the conserved quantity is called "energy". The energy conservation law is a consequence of the shift <a href="Symmetry%20in%20physics">symmetry</a> of time; energy conservation is implied by the empirical fact that the <a href="Physical%20law">laws of physics</a> do not change with time itself. Philosophically this can be stated as "nothing depends on time per se".
In other words, if the physical system is invariant under the <a href="continuous%20symmetry">continuous symmetry</a> of <a href="time%20translation">time translation</a> then its energy (which is <a href="canonical%20conjugate">canonical conjugate</a> quantity to time) is conserved. Conversely, systems which are not invariant under shifts in time (an example, systems with time dependent potential energy) do not exhibit conservation of energy – unless we consider them to exchange energy with another, external system so that the theory of the enlarged system becomes time invariant again. Conservation of energy for finite systems is valid in such physical theories as special relativity and quantum theory (including <a href="Quantum%20electrodynamics">QED</a>) in the flat <a href="space-time">space-time</a>.

With the discovery of <a href="special%20relativity">special relativity</a> by <a href="Henri%20Poincar%C3%A9">Henri Poincaré</a> and <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>, energy was proposed to be one component of an <a href="four-momentum">energy-momentum 4-vector</a>. Each of the four components (one of energy and three of momentum) of this vector is separately conserved across time, in any closed system, as seen from any given <a href="inertial%20reference%20frame">inertial reference frame</a>. Also conserved is the vector length (<a href="Minkowski%20space">Minkowski norm</a>), which is the <a href="rest%20mass">rest mass</a> for single particles, and the <a href="invariant%20mass">invariant mass</a> for systems of particles (where momenta and energy are separately summed before the length is calculated—see the article on <a href="invariant%20mass">invariant mass</a>).

The relativistic energy of a single <a href="mass">mass</a>ive particle contains a term related to its <a href="rest%20mass">rest mass</a> in addition to its kinetic energy of motion. In the limit of zero kinetic energy (or equivalently in the <a href="rest%20frame">rest frame</a>) of a massive particle, or else in the <a href="center%20of%20momentum%20frame">center of momentum frame</a> for objects or systems which retain kinetic energy, the <a href="total%20energy">total energy</a> of particle or object (including internal kinetic energy in systems) is related to its <a href="rest%20mass">rest mass</a> or its <a href="invariant%20mass">invariant mass</a> via the famous equation formula_26.

Thus, the rule of <a href="Mass%20in%20special%20relativity">"conservation of energy" over time in special relativity</a> continues to hold, so long as the <a href="frame%20of%20reference">reference frame</a> of the observer is unchanged. This applies to the total energy of systems, although different observers disagree as to the energy value. Also conserved, and invariant to all observers, is the <a href="invariant%20mass">invariant mass</a>, which is the minimal system mass and energy that can be seen by any observer, and which is defined by the <a href="energy%E2%80%93momentum%20relation">energy–momentum relation</a>.

In <a href="general%20relativity">general relativity</a>, energy–momentum conservation is not well-defined except in certain special cases. Energy-momentum is typically expressed with the aid of a <a href="stress%E2%80%93energy%E2%80%93momentum%20pseudotensor">stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor</a>. However, since pseudotensors are not tensors, they do not transform cleanly between reference frames. If the metric under consideration is static (that is, does not change with time) or asymptotically flat (that is, at an infinite distance away spacetime looks empty), then energy conservation holds without major pitfalls. In practice, some metrics such as the <a href="Friedmann%E2%80%93Lema%C3%AEtre%E2%80%93Robertson%E2%80%93Walker%20metric">Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric</a> do not satisfy these constraints and energy conservation is not well defined. The theory of general relativity leaves open the question of whether there is a conservation of energy for the entire universe.

In <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>, energy of a quantum system is described by a <a href="self-adjoint%20operator">self-adjoint</a> (or Hermitian) operator called the <a href="Hamiltonian%20%28quantum%20mechanics%29">Hamiltonian</a>, which acts on the <a href="Hilbert%20space">Hilbert space</a> (or a space of <a href="wave%20functions">wave functions</a>) of the system. If the Hamiltonian is a time-independent operator, emergence probability of the measurement result does not change in time over the evolution of the system. Thus the expectation value of energy is also time independent. The local energy conservation in quantum field theory is ensured by the quantum <a href="Noether%27s%20theorem">Noether's theorem</a> for energy-momentum tensor operator. Note that due to the lack of the (universal) time operator in quantum theory, the uncertainty relations for time and energy are not fundamental in contrast to the position-momentum uncertainty principle, and merely holds in specific cases (see <a href="Uncertainty%20principle">Uncertainty principle</a>). Energy at each fixed time can in principle be exactly measured without any trade-off in precision forced by the time-energy uncertainty relations. Thus the conservation of energy in time is a well defined concept even in quantum mechanics.

Fourth International

The Fourth International (FI) is a <a href="Revolutionary%20socialism">revolutionary socialist</a> <a href="international%20organisation">international organisation</a> consisting of followers of <a href="Leon%20Trotsky">Leon Trotsky</a>, or <a href="Trotskyism">Trotskyists</a>, with the declared goal of helping the working class overthrow <a href="capitalism">capitalism</a> and work toward <a href="world%20communism">international communism</a>. The Fourth International was established in France in 1938 as Trotsky and his supporters, having been expelled from the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, considered the <a href="Third%20International">Third International</a> or <a href="Comintern">Comintern</a> to have become lost to <a href="Stalinism">Stalinism</a> and incapable of leading the <a href="proletarian%20internationalism">international working class</a> to political power. Thus, Trotskyists founded their own competing Fourth International.

Today, there is no longer a single cohesive Fourth International. Throughout the better part of its existence, the Fourth International was hounded by agents of the <a href="Chronology%20of%20Soviet%20secret%20police%20agencies">Soviet secret police</a>, repressed by capitalist countries such as France and the United States and rejected by followers of the Soviet Union and later <a href="Maoism">Maoism</a> as illegitimate. It struggled to maintain contact under these conditions of illegality and repression around much of the world during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> because when workers' uprisings did occur they were often under the influence of Soviet-inspired, <a href="Anarchism">anarchist</a>, <a href="Social%20democracy">social democratic</a>, Maoist, or militant nationalist groups, leading to defeats for the FI and its Trotskyists, who seldom gathered similar support. Despite this, many parts of the world, including Latin America, Europe and Asia, continue to have large Trotskyist groupings who are attracted to its <a href="Anti-Stalinist%20left">anti-Stalinist</a> positions and its defense of workers' internationalism. Quite a few of these groups carry the label Fourth Internationalist either in their organisation's name, major political position documents, or both.

In line with its Trotskyist underpinnings, the Fourth International tended to view the Comintern as <a href="deformed%20workers%27%20state">worthy of conditional support even considering its corruption</a> and although it regarded its own ideas as more advanced and thus superior to those of the Third International, it did not actively seek the Comintern's destruction. It does not operate as a cohesive entity in the manner of the prior internationals. The FI suffered a major split in 1940 and an even more significant split in 1953. A partial reunification occurred in 1963, but the international never recovered enough to re-emerge as a single transnational grouping. Trotskyists' response to that situation has been in the form of its many <a href="List%20of%20Trotskyist%20internationals">Internationals</a>, with some divided over ideas of which organisation represents the true political continuity of the Fourth International.

Trotskyists regard themselves as working in opposition to both capitalism and Stalinism. Trotsky advocated <a href="proletariat">proletarian</a> revolution as set out in his theory of "<a href="permanent%20revolution">permanent revolution</a>", and believed that a <a href="Socialist%20state">workers' state</a> would not be able to hold out against the pressures of a hostile capitalist world unless <a href="communist%20revolution">socialist revolution</a>s quickly took hold in other countries as well. This theory was advanced in opposition to the view held by the Stalinists that "<a href="Socialism%20in%20One%20Country">socialism in one country</a>" could be built in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> alone. Furthermore, Trotsky and his supporters harshly criticized the increasingly <a href="Totalitarianism">totalitarian</a> nature of <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>'s <a href="History%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union%20%281927%E2%80%931953%29">rule</a>. They argued that socialism without democracy is impossible. Thus, faced with the increasing lack of democracy in the Soviet Union, they concluded that it was no longer a socialist workers' state, but a <a href="degenerated%20workers%27%20state">degenerated workers' state</a>.

Trotsky and his supporters had been organised since 1923 as the <a href="Left%20Opposition">Left Opposition</a>. They opposed the <a href="bureaucratization">bureaucratization</a> of the Soviet Union, which they analysed as being partly caused by the poverty and isolation of the <a href="economy%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Soviet economy</a>. Stalin's theory of socialism in one country was developed in 1924 as an opposition to Trotsky's Theory of <a href="Permanent%20revolution">Permanent Revolution</a>, which argued that capitalism was a world system and required a <a href="world%20revolution">world revolution</a> in order to replace it with socialism. Prior to 1924, the <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a>s' international perspective had been guided by Trotsky's position. Trotsky argued that Stalin's theory represented the interests of bureaucratic elements in direct opposition to the working class.

Eventually, Trotsky was sent into internal exile and his supporters were jailed. However, the Left Opposition continued to work in secret within the Soviet Union. Trotsky was exiled to Turkey in 1928. He moved from there to France, Norway and finally to Mexico. He was assassinated on Stalin's orders in Mexico in August 1940.

A <a href="political%20international">political international</a> is an organisation of political parties or activists with the aim of co-ordinating their activity for a common purpose. There had been a long tradition of socialists organising on an international basis, and <a href="Karl%20Marx">Karl Marx</a> had led the <a href="International%20Workingmen%27s%20Association">International Workingmen's Association</a>, which later became known as the "first international".

After the International Workingmen's Association disbanded in 1876, several attempts were made to revive the organisation, culminating in the formation of the Socialist International (<a href="Second%20International">Second International</a>) in 1889. This was disbanded in 1916 following disagreements over <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. Although the organisation reformed in 1923 as the <a href="Socialist%20International">Labour and Socialist International</a>, supporters of the <a href="October%20Revolution">October Revolution</a> and the Bolsheviks had already set up the <a href="Communist%20International">Communist International</a> (Comintern), which they regarded as the Third International. This was organised on a <a href="Democratic%20centralism">democratic centralist</a> basis, with component parties required to fight for policies adopted by the body as a whole.

By declaring themselves the Fourth International, the "World Party of Socialist Revolution", the Trotskyists were publicly asserting their continuity with the Comintern, and with its predecessors. Their recognition of the importance of these earlier Internationals was coupled with a belief that they eventually degenerated. Although the Socialist International and Comintern were still in existence, the Trotskyists did not believe those organisations were capable of supporting revolutionary socialism and <a href="proletarian%20internationalism">internationalism</a>.

The foundation of the Fourth International was therefore spurred in part by a desire to form a stronger political current, rather than being seen as the communist opposition to the Comintern and the Soviet Union. Trotsky believed that its formation was all the more urgent for the role he saw it playing in the impending <a href="World%20War%20II">World War</a>.

In the early 1930s, Trotsky and his supporters believed that Stalin's influence over the Third International could still be fought from within and slowly rolled back. They organised themselves into the International Left Opposition in 1930, which was intended to be a group of anti-Stalinist dissenters "within" the Third International. Stalin's supporters, who dominated the International, would no longer tolerate dissent. All Trotskyists, and those suspected of being influenced by Trotskyism, were expelled.

Trotsky claimed that the <a href="Third%20Period">Third Period</a> policies of the Comintern had contributed to the rise of <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> in Germany, and that its turn to a <a href="popular%20front">popular front</a> policy (aiming to unite all ostensibly <a href="anti-fascist">anti-fascist</a> forces) sowed illusions in <a href="reformism">reformism</a> and <a href="pacifism">pacifism</a> and "clear[ed] the road for a fascist overturn". By 1935 he claimed that the Comintern had fallen irredeemably into the hands of the Stalinist bureaucracy. He and his supporters, expelled from the Third International, participated in a conference of the <a href="London%20Bureau">London Bureau</a> of socialist parties outside both the Socialist International and the Comintern. Three of those parties joined the Left Opposition in signing a document written by Trotsky calling for a Fourth International, which became known as the "Declaration of Four". Of those, two soon distanced themselves from the agreement, but the Dutch <a href="Revolutionary%20Socialist%20Party%20%28Netherlands%29">Revolutionary Socialist Party</a> worked with the International Left Opposition to declare the International Communist League.

This position was contested by <a href="Andr%C3%A9s%20Nin">Andrés Nin</a> and some other members of the League who did not support the call for a new International. This group prioritised regroupment with other communist oppositions, principally the <a href="International%20Communist%20Opposition">International Communist Opposition</a> (ICO), linked to the <a href="Right%20Opposition">Right Opposition</a> in the Soviet Party, a regroupment which eventually led to the formation of the <a href="International%20Bureau%20for%20Revolutionary%20Socialist%20Unity">International Bureau for Revolutionary Socialist Unity</a>. Trotsky considered those organisations to be <a href="Centrist%20Marxism">centrist</a>. Despite Trotsky, the Spanish section merged with the Spanish section of ICO, forming the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (<a href="POUM">POUM</a>). Trotsky claimed the merger was to be a capitulation to centrism. The <a href="Socialist%20Workers%27%20Party%20of%20Germany">Socialist Workers' Party of Germany</a>, a left split from the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">Social Democratic Party of Germany</a> founded in 1931, co-operated with the International Left Opposition briefly in 1933 but soon abandoned the call for a new International.

In 1935, Trotsky wrote an "Open Letter for the Fourth International", reaffirming the "Declaration of Four", while documenting the recent course of the Comintern and the Socialist International. In the letter, he called for the urgent formation of a Fourth International. The "First International Conference for the Fourth International" was held in Paris in June 1936, reports giving its location as <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a> for security reasons. This meeting dissolved the International Communist League, founding in its place the Movement for the Fourth International on Trotsky's perspectives.

The foundation of the Fourth International was seen as more than just the simple renaming of an international tendency that was already in existence. It was argued that the Third International had now degenerated completely and was therefore to be seen as a <a href="counter-revolutionary">counter-revolutionary</a> organisation that would in time of crisis defend capitalism. Trotsky believed that the coming <a href="World%20War%20II">World War</a> would produce a <a href="revolutionary%20wave">revolutionary wave</a> of class and national struggles, rather as <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> had done.

Stalin reacted to the growing strength of Trotsky's supporters with a major political massacre of people within the Soviet Union, and the assassination of Trotsky's supporters and family abroad. He had agents go through historical documents and photos in order to attempt to erase Trotsky's memory from the history books. According to the historian Mario Kessler, Stalin's supporters turned to <a href="anti-semitism">anti-semitism</a> to whip up sentiment against Trotsky (as Trotsky was a Jew). Stalin's daughter later claimed that his fight with Trotsky laid the foundations for his later anti-semitic campaigns.

The International's rationale was to construct new mass revolutionary parties able to lead successful workers' revolutions. It saw these arising from a revolutionary wave which would develop alongside and as a result of the coming World War. Thirty delegates attended a founding conference, held in September 1938, in the home of <a href="Alfred%20Rosmer">Alfred Rosmer</a> just outside Paris. Present at the meeting were delegates from all the major countries of Europe, and from North America, although for reasons of cost and distance, few delegates attended from Asia or Latin America. An International Secretariat was established, with many of the day's leading Trotskyists and most countries in which Trotskyists were active represented. Among the resolutions adopted by the conference was the "<a href="The%20Death%20Agony%20of%20Capitalism%20and%20the%20Tasks%20of%20the%20Fourth%20International">Transitional Programme</a>".

The "Transitional Programme" was the central programmatic statement of the congress, summarising its strategic and tactical conceptions for the revolutionary period that it saw opening up as a result of the war which Trotsky had been predicting for some years. It is not, however, the definitive programme of the Fourth International as is often suggested but instead contains a summation of the conjunctural understanding of the movement at that date and a series of transitional policies designed to develop the struggle for workers' power.

At the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, in 1939, the International Secretariat was moved to New York City. The resident International Executive Committee failed to meet, largely because of a struggle in the <a href="Socialist%20Workers%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">U.S. Socialist Workers Party</a> (SWP) between Trotsky's supporters and the tendency of <a href="Max%20Shachtman">Max Shachtman</a>, <a href="Martin%20Abern">Martin Abern</a> and <a href="James%20Burnham">James Burnham</a>. The secretariat was composed of those committee members who happened to be in the city, most of whom were co-thinkers of Shachtman. The disagreement centred on the <a href="Shachtmanism">Shachtmanite</a>s' disagreements with the SWP's internal policy, and over the FI's unconditional defence of the USSR.

Trotsky opened a public debate with Shachtman and Burnham and developed his positions in a series of polemics written in 1939–1940 and later collected in "<a href="Leon%20Trotsky">In Defense of Marxism</a>". Shachtman and Burnham's tendency resigned from the International in early 1940, alongside almost 40% of the SWP's members, many of whom became founder members of the <a href="Workers%20Party%20%28US%29">Workers Party</a>.

In May 1940 an emergency conference of the International met at a secret location "somewhere in the Western Hemisphere". It adopted a manifesto drafted by Trotsky shortly before his murder and a range of policies on the work of the International, including one calling for the reunification of the then-divided Fourth Internationalist groups in Britain.

Secretariat members who had supported Shachtman were expelled by the emergency conference, with the support of Trotsky himself. While leader of the SWP <a href="James%20P.%20Cannon">James P. Cannon</a> later said that he did not believe the split to be definitive and final, the two groups did not reunite. A new International Executive Committee was appointed, which came under the increasing influence of the <a href="Socialist%20Workers%20Party%20%28US%29">Socialist Workers Party</a>.

The Fourth International was hit hard during World War II. Trotsky was assassinated, many of the FI's European affiliates were destroyed by the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazis</a> and several of its Asian affiliates were destroyed by the <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Empire of Japan</a>. The survivors, in Europe, Asia and elsewhere, were largely cut off from each other and from the International Secretariat. The new secretary, <a href="Jean%20Van%20Heijenoort">Jean Van Heijenoort</a> (also known as Gerland), was able to do little more than publish articles in the SWP's theoretical journal "Fourth International". Despite this dislocation, the various groups sought to maintain links and some connections were kept up throughout the early part of the war by sailors enlisted in the <a href="U.S.%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> who had cause to visit <a href="Marseilles">Marseilles</a>. Contact was steady, if irregular, between the SWP and the British Trotskyists, with the result that the Americans exerted what influence they had to encourage the <a href="Workers%27%20International%20League%20%281937%29">Workers' International League</a> into the International through a fusion with the <a href="Revolutionary%20Socialist%20League%20%28UK%2C%201938%29">Revolutionary Socialist League</a>, a union that had been requested by the Emergency Conference.

In 1942, a debate on the <a href="national%20question">national question</a> in Europe opened up between the majority of the SWP and a movement led by Van Heijenoort, <a href="Albert%20Goldman%20%28politician%29">Albert Goldman</a> and <a href="Felix%20Morrow">Felix Morrow</a>. This minority anticipated that the Nazi dictatorship would be replaced with capitalism rather than by a socialist revolution, leading to the revival of <a href="Stalinism">Stalinism</a> and <a href="social%20democracy">social democracy</a>. In December 1943, they criticised the SWP's view as underestimating the rising prestige of Stalinism and the opportunities for the capitalists to use democratic concessions. The SWP's central committee argued that democratic capitalism could not revive, resulting in either military dictatorship by the capitalists or a workers' revolution. It held that this would reinforce the need for building the Fourth International, and adhered rigidly to their interpretation of Trotsky's works.

The wartime debate about post-war perspectives was accelerated by the resolution of the February 1944 European Conference of the Fourth International. The conference appointed a new European Secretariat and elected <a href="Michel%20Raptis">Michel Raptis</a>, a Greek resident in France also known as Michel Pablo, the organisational secretary of its European Bureau. Raptis and other bureau members re-established contact between the Trotskyist parties. The European conference extended the lessons of a revolution then unfolding in Italy, and concluded that a revolutionary wave would cross Europe as the war ended. The SWP had a similar perspective. The British <a href="Revolutionary%20Communist%20Party%20%281944-1949%29">Revolutionary Communist Party</a> (RCP) disagreed and held that capitalism was not about to plunge into massive crisis but rather that an upturn in the economy was already underway. A group of leaders of the French <a href="Internationalist%20Communist%20Party">Internationalist Communist Party</a> (PCI) around <a href="Yvan%20Craipeau">Yvan Craipeau</a> argued a similar position until they were expelled from the PCI in 1948.

In April 1946 delegates from the principal European sections and a number of others attended a "Second International Congress". This set about rebuilding the International Secretariat of the Fourth International with Michel Raptis appointed Secretary and <a href="Ernest%20Mandel">Ernest Mandel</a>, a Belgian, taking a leading role.

Pablo and Mandel aimed to counter the opposition of the majorities inside the British Revolutionary Communist Party and French Internationalist Communist Party. Initially, they encouraged party members to vote out their leaderships. They supported <a href="Gerry%20Healy">Gerry Healy</a>'s opposition in the RCP. In France, they backed elements, including <a href="Pierre%20Frank">Pierre Frank</a> and <a href="Marcel%20Bleibtreu">Marcel Bleibtreu</a>, opposed to the new leadership of the PCI albeit for differing reasons.

The Stalinist occupation of Eastern Europe was the issue of prime concern, and it raised many problems of interpretation. At first, the International held that, while the <a href="Soviet%20Union">USSR</a> was a <a href="degenerated%20workers%27%20state">degenerated workers' state</a>, the post-World War II East European states were still <a href="bourgeois">bourgeois</a> entities, because revolution from above was not possible, and capitalism persisted.

Another issue that needed to be dealt with was the possibility that the economy would revive. This was initially denied by Mandel (who was quickly forced to revise his opinion, and later devoted his PhD dissertation to <a href="late%20capitalism">late capitalism</a>, analysing the unexpected "third age" of capitalist development). Mandel's perspective mirrored uncertainty at that time about the future viability and prospects of capitalism, not just among "all" Trotskyist groups, but also among leading economists. <a href="Paul%20Samuelson">Paul Samuelson</a> had envisaged in 1943 the probability of a "nightmarish combination of the worst features of inflation and <a href="deflation">deflation</a>", worrying that "there would be ushered in the greatest period of unemployment and industrial dislocation which any economy has ever faced". <a href="Joseph%20Schumpeter">Joseph Schumpeter</a> for his part claimed that "[t]he general opinion seems to be that capitalist methods will be unequal to the task of reconstruction". He regarded it as "not open to doubt that the decay of capitalist society is very far advanced".

The Second World Congress in April 1948 was attended by delegates from 22 sections. It debated a range of resolutions on the <a href="Jewish%20Question">Jewish Question</a>, Stalinism, the colonial countries and the specific situations facing sections in certain countries. By this point the FI was united around the view that the Eastern European "<a href="buffer%20state">buffer state</a>s" were still capitalist countries.

The Congress was especially notable for bringing the International into much closer contact with Trotskyist groups from across the globe. These included such significant groups as the <a href="Revolutionary%20Workers%27%20Party%20%28Bolivia%29">Revolutionary Workers' Party</a> of <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a> and the <a href="Lanka%20Sama%20Samaja%20Party">Lanka Sama Samaja Party</a> in what was then <a href="Ceylon">Ceylon</a>, but the previously large Vietnamese Trotskyist groups had mostly been eliminated or absorbed by the supporters of <a href="Ho%20Chi%20Minh">Ho Chi Minh</a>.

After the Second World Congress in 1948, the International Secretariat attempted to open communications with <a href="Josip%20Broz%20Tito">Josip Broz Tito</a>'s regime in <a href="Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>. In their analysis, it differed from the rest of the <a href="Eastern%20Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a> because it was established by the <a href="Partisan%20%28military%29">partisan</a>s of World War II who had fought against Nazi occupation, as opposed to by Stalin's invading armies. The British RCP, led by <a href="Jock%20Haston">Jock Haston</a> and supported by <a href="Ted%20Grant">Ted Grant</a>, were highly critical of this move.

The Third World Congress in 1951 resolved that the economies of the East European states and their political regimes had come to resemble that of the USSR more and more. These states were then described as <a href="deformed%20workers%20state">deformed workers state</a>s in an analogy with the degenerated workers state in Russia. The term "deformed" was used rather than "degenerated", because no workers' revolution had led to the foundation of these states.

The Third World Congress envisaged the real possibility of an "international civil war" in the near future. It argued that the mass Communist parties "may, under certain favourable conditions, go beyond the aims set for them by the Soviet bureaucracy and project a revolutionary orientation". Given the supposed closeness of war, the FI thought that the Communist Parties and social democratic parties would be the only significant force that could defend the workers of the world against the <a href="imperialist">imperialist</a> camp in those countries where there were mass forces.

In line with this geopolitical perspective, Pablo argued that the only way the Trotskyists could avoid isolation was for various sections of the Fourth International to undertake long-term <a href="entryism">entryism</a> in the mass Communist or Social Democratic parties. This tactic was known as entrism "sui generis", to distinguish it from the short-term entry tactic employed before World War II. For example, it meant that the project of building an open and independent Trotskyist party was shelved in France, because it was regarded as not politically feasible alongside entry into the French Communist Party.

This perspective was accepted within the Fourth International, yet sowed the seeds for the split in 1953. At the Third World Congress, the sections agreed with the perspective of an international civil war. The French section disagreed with the associated tactic of <a href="entryism">entryism</a> sui generis, and held that Pablo was underestimating the independent role of the working class parties in the Fourth International. The leaders of the majority of the Trotskyist organisation in France, Marcel Bleibtreu and <a href="Pierre%20Lambert">Pierre Lambert</a>, refused to follow the line of the International. The International leadership had them replaced by a minority, leading to a permanent split in the French section.

In the wake of the World Congress, the line of the International Leadership was generally accepted by groups around the world, including the U.S. SWP whose leader, James P. Cannon, corresponded with the French majority to support the tactic of entrism "sui generis". At the same time, however, Cannon, Healy and Mandel were deeply concerned by Pablo's political evolution. Cannon and Healy were also alarmed by Pablo's intervention into the French section, and by suggestions that Pablo might use the International's authority in this way in other sections of the Fourth International that felt entrism "sui generis" was not a suitable tactic in their own countries. In particular, minority tendencies, exemplified in Britain by <a href="John%20Lawrence%20%28political%20activist%29">John Lawrence</a> and in the U.S. by <a href="Bert%20Cochran">Bert Cochran</a>, to support entrism "sui generis" hinted that Pablo's support for their views indicated that the International might also demand Trotskyists in those countries adopt that tactic.

In 1953, the SWP's national committee issued an "Open Letter to Trotskyists Throughout the World" and organised the <a href="International%20Committee%20of%20the%20Fourth%20International">International Committee of the Fourth International</a> (ICFI). This was a public faction which initially included, in addition to the SWP, <a href="Gerry%20Healy">Gerry Healy</a>'s British section <a href="The%20Club%20%28Trotskyist%29">The Club</a>, the Internationalist Communist Party in France (then led by <a href="Pierre%20Lambert">Lambert</a> who had expelled Bleibtreu and his grouping), <a href="Nahuel%20Moreno">Nahuel Moreno</a>'s party in Argentina and the Austrian and Chinese sections of the FI. The sections of the ICFI withdrew from the International Secretariat, which suspended their voting rights. Both sides claimed they constituted a majority of the former International.

Sri Lanka's Lanka Sama Samaja Party, then the country's leading workers' party, took a middle position during this dispute. It continued to participate in the ISFI but argued for a joint congress, for reunification with the ICFI.

An excerpt from the "Open Letter" explains the split as follows:
To sum up: The lines of cleavage between Pablo's revisionism and orthodox Trotskyism are so deep that no compromise is possible either politically or organizationally. The Pablo faction has demonstrated that it will not permit democratic decisions truly reflecting majority opinion to be reached. They demand complete submission to their criminal policy. They are determined to drive all <a href="Orthodox%20Trotskyism">orthodox Trotskyists</a> out of the Fourth International or to muzzle and handcuff them.

Their scheme has been to inject their Stalinist conciliationism piecemeal and likewise in piecemeal fashion, get rid of those who come to see what is happening and raise objections.

Over the following decade, the IC referred to the rest of the International as the "International Secretariat of the Fourth International", emphasising its view that the Secretariat did not speak for the International as a whole. The Secretariat continued to view itself as the leadership of the International. It held a Fourth World Congress in 1954 to regroup and to recognise reorganised sections in Britain, France and the U.S.

Parts of the International Committee were divided over whether the split with "Pabloism" was permanent or temporary, and it was perhaps as a result of this that it did not declare itself to be "the" Fourth International. Those sections that considered the split permanent embarked on a discussion about the history of the split and its meanings.

The sections of the International that recognised the leadership of the International Secretariat remained optimistic about the possibilities for increasing the International's political influence and extended the <a href="entrism">entrism</a> into <a href="social%20democratic%20parties">social democratic parties</a> which was already underway in Britain, Austria and elsewhere. The 1954 congress emphasised entrism into <a href="Communist%20party">communist parties</a> and nationalist parties in the colonies, pressing for democratic reforms, ostensibly to encourage the left-wing they perceived to exist in the communist parties to join with them in a revolution. Tensions developed between those who subscribed to the mainstream views of Pablo and a minority that argued unsuccessfully against open work. A number of these delegates walked out of the World Congress, and would eventually leave the International, including the leader of the new British section, <a href="John%20GM%20Lawrence">John Lawrence</a>, <a href="George%20Clarke%20%28socialist%29">George Clarke</a>, <a href="Michele%20Mestre">Michele Mestre</a> (a leader of the French section), and <a href="Murray%20Dowson">Murray Dowson</a> (a leader of the Canadian group).

The Secretariat organised a Fifth World Congress in October 1957. Mandel and <a href="Pierre%20Frank">Pierre Frank</a> appraised the <a href="Algerian%20revolution">Algerian revolution</a> and surmised that it was essential to reorient in the colonial states and neocolonies towards the emerging <a href="guerrilla%20warfare">guerrilla</a>-led revolutions. According to Robert Alexander, Ernest Mandel has written that an organisation in Indonesia, the Partai Acoma, was affiliate to the FI from 1959 until the 1965 coup in that country.

The Sixth World Congress in 1961 marked a lessening of the political divisions between the majority of supporters of the International Secretariat and the leadership of the SWP in the United States. In particular, the congress stressed support for the <a href="Cuban%20revolution">Cuban revolution</a> and a growing emphasis on building parties in the imperialist countries. The sixth congress also criticised the Lanka Sama Samaja Party, its Sri Lankan section, for seeming to support the <a href="Sri%20Lanka%20Freedom%20Party">Sri Lanka Freedom Party</a>, which they saw as bourgeois nationalists; the U.S. SWP made similar criticisms.

In 1962 the IC and IS formed a Parity Commission to organise a common World Congress. The supporters of Michel Pablo and <a href="J.%20Posadas">Juan Posadas</a> opposed the convergence. The supporters of Posadas left the International in 1962. At the 1963 reunification congress, the sections of the IC and IS reunified (with two exceptions: the British and French sections of the IC). This was largely a result of their mutual support for Ernest Mandel and <a href="Joseph%20Hansen%20%28socialist%29">Joseph Hansen</a>'s resolution "Dynamics of World Revolution Today" and for the <a href="Cuban%20Revolution">Cuban Revolution</a>. This document distinguished between different revolutionary tasks in the imperialist countries, the "<a href="workers%27%20state">workers' state</a>s", and the colonial and semi-colonial countries. In 1963, the reunified <a href="Fourth%20International%20%281963%29">Fourth International</a> elected a United Secretariat of the Fourth International (USFI), by which name the organisation as a whole is often still referred.

Since the 1963 reunification, a number of approaches have developed within international Trotskyism towards the Fourth International.

In uniting the large majority of Trotskyists in one organisation, the Fourth International created a tradition which has since been claimed by many Trotskyist organisations.

Echoing Marx's "<a href="Communist%20Manifesto">Communist Manifesto</a>", the "Transitional Programme" ended with the declaration "Workers men and women of all countries, place yourselves under the banner of the Fourth International. It is the banner of your approaching victory!". It declared demands to be placed on capitalists, opposition to the bureaucracy in the Soviet Union, and support for workers' action against fascism. Most of the demands on capitalists remain unfulfilled. The collapse of the Soviet Union occurred, but through a <a href="social%20revolution">social revolution</a> leading to the restoration of capitalism, rather than the <a href="political%20revolution">political revolution</a> proposed by the Trotskyists. Many Trotskyist groups have been active in anti-fascist campaigns, but the Fourth International has never played a major role in the toppling of a regime.

Those groups which follow traditions that left the Fourth International in its early years argue that, despite initially correct positions, it had little impact. <a href="Lutte%20Ouvriere">Lutte Ouvriere</a> claims that it "did not survive the Second World War". <a href="Workers%20Liberty">Workers Liberty</a>, which follows in the <a href="third%20camp">third camp</a> tradition established by the <a href="Workers%20Party%20%28US%29">Workers Party</a>, holds that "Trotsky and everything he represented was defeated and as we have to recognise in retrospect defeated for a whole historical period."

Other groups point to a positive impact. The ICFI claim that "the [early] Fourth International consisted mainly of cadres who remained true to their aims" and describes much of the Fourth International's early activity as "correct and principled". The reunified FI claim that "the Fourth International refused to compromise with capitalism either in its fascist or democratic variants." In its view, "many of the predictions made by Trotsky when he founded the Fourth International were proved wrong by history. But what was absolutely vindicated were his key political judgements."

Tennessine

Tennessine is a synthetic <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> with symbol Ts and <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> 117. It is the second-heaviest known element and the penultimate element of the <a href="period%207%20element">7th period</a> of the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a>.

The discovery of tennessine was officially announced in <a href="Dubna">Dubna</a>, Russia, by a Russian–American collaboration in April 2010, which makes it the most recently discovered element . One of its <a href="daughter%20isotope">daughter isotope</a>s was created directly in 2011, partially confirming the results of the experiment. The experiment itself was repeated successfully by the same collaboration in 2012 and by a joint German–American team in May 2014. In December 2015, the <a href="IUPAC/IUPAP%20Joint%20Working%20Party">Joint Working Party</a> of the <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Pure%20and%20Applied%20Chemistry">International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry</a> (IUPAC) and the <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Pure%20and%20Applied%20Physics">International Union of Pure and Applied Physics</a>, which evaluates claims of discovery of new elements, recognized the element and assigned the priority to the Russian–American team. In June 2016, the IUPAC published a declaration stating that the discoverers had suggested the name "tennessine" after <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>, United States. In November 2016, they officially adopted the name "tennessine".

Tennessine may be located in the "<a href="island%20of%20stability">island of stability</a>", a concept that explains why some superheavy elements are more stable compared to an overall trend of decreasing stability for elements beyond bismuth on the periodic table. The synthesized tennessine atoms have lasted tens and hundreds of <a href="millisecond">millisecond</a>s. In the periodic table, tennessine is expected to be a member of group 17, all other members of which are <a href="halogens">halogens</a>. Some of its properties may significantly differ from those of the halogens due to <a href="Relativistic%20quantum%20chemistry">relativistic effects</a>. As a result, tennessine is expected to be a volatile <a href="metal">metal</a> that neither forms <a href="anion">anion</a>s nor achieves high <a href="oxidation%20state">oxidation state</a>s. A few key properties, such as its melting and boiling points and its first <a href="ionization%20energy">ionization energy</a>, are nevertheless expected to follow the <a href="periodic%20trends">periodic trends</a> of the halogens.

In December 2004, the <a href="Joint%20Institute%20for%20Nuclear%20Research">Joint Institute for Nuclear Research</a> (JINR) team in <a href="Dubna">Dubna</a>, <a href="Moscow%20Oblast">Moscow Oblast</a>, Russia, proposed a joint experiment with the <a href="Oak%20Ridge%20National%20Laboratory">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a> (ORNL) in <a href="Oak%20Ridge%2C%20Tennessee">Oak Ridge</a>, <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>, United States, to synthesize element 117—so-called for the 117 <a href="proton">proton</a>s in its <a href="atomic%20nucleus">nucleus</a>. Their proposal involved <a href="nuclear%20fusion">fusing</a> a <a href="berkelium">berkelium</a> (element 97) target and a <a href="calcium">calcium</a> (element 20) beam, conducted via bombardment of the berkelium target with calcium nuclei: this would complete a set of experiments done at the JINR on the fusion of <a href="actinide">actinide</a> targets with a calcium-48 beam, which had thus far produced the new elements <a href="nihonium">113</a>–<a href="livermorium">116</a> and <a href="oganesson">118</a>. The ORNL—then the world's only producer of berkelium—could not then provide the element, as they had temporarily ceased production, and re-initiating it would be too costly. Plans to synthesize element 117 were suspended in favor of the confirmation of element 118, which had been produced earlier in 2002 by bombarding a <a href="californium">californium</a> target with calcium. The required berkelium-249 is a by-product in californium-252 production, and obtaining the required amount of berkelium was an even more difficult task than obtaining that of californium, as well as costly: it would cost around 3.5 million dollars, and the parties agreed to wait for a commercial order of californium production, from which berkelium could be extracted.

The JINR team sought to use berkelium because <a href="calcium-48">calcium-48</a>, the <a href="isotopes%20of%20calcium">isotope of calcium</a> used in the beam, has 20 protons and 28 neutrons, making a neutron–proton ratio of 1.4; and it is the lightest stable or near-stable nucleus with such a large neutron excess. The second-lightest such nucleus, <a href="palladium-110">palladium-110</a> (46 protons, 64 neutrons, neutron–proton ratio of 1.391), is much heavier. Thanks to the neutron excess, the resulting nuclei were expected to be heavier and closer to the sought-after <a href="island%20of%20stability">island of stability</a>. Of the aimed for 117 protons, calcium has 20, and thus they needed to use berkelium, which has 97 protons in its nucleus.

In February 2005, the leader of the JINR team—<a href="Yuri%20Oganessian">Yuri Oganessian</a>—presented a colloquium at ORNL. Also in attendance were representatives of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, who had previously worked with JINR on the discovery of elements 113–116 and 118, and Joseph Hamilton of <a href="Vanderbilt%20University">Vanderbilt University</a>, a collaborator of Oganessian.

Hamilton checked if the ORNL high-flux reactor produced californium for a commercial order: the required berkelium could be obtained as a by-product. He learned that it did not and there was no expectation for such an order in the immediate future. Hamilton kept monitoring the situation, making the checks once in a while. (Later, Oganessian referred to Hamilton as "the father of 117" for doing this work.)

ORNL resumed californium production in spring 2008. Hamilton noted the restart during the summer and made a deal on subsequent extraction of berkelium. During a September 2008 symposium at <a href="Vanderbilt%20University">Vanderbilt University</a> in <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville</a>, Tennessee celebrating his 50th year on the Physics faculty, he introduced Oganessian to James Roberto (then the deputy director for science and technology at ORNL). They established a collaboration among JINR, ORNL, and Vanderbilt; the team at the <a href="Lawrence%20Livermore%20National%20Laboratory">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a> (LLNL) in <a href="Livermore%2C%20California">Livermore</a>, <a href="California">California</a>, U.S., was soon invited to join.
In November 2008, the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Energy">U.S. Department of Energy</a>, which had oversight over the <a href="High%20Flux%20Isotope%20Reactor">reactor in Oak Ridge</a>, allowed the scientific use of the extracted berkelium. The production lasted 250 days and ended in late December 2008, resulting in 22 milligrams of berkelium, enough to perform the experiment. In January 2009, the berkelium was removed from ORNL’s High Flux Isotope Reactor; it was subsequently cooled for 90 days and then processed at ORNL’s Radiochemical Engineering and Development Center to separate and purify the berkelium material, which took another 90 days. Its <a href="half-life">half-life</a> is only 330 days: after that time, half the berkelium produced would have <a href="radioactive%20decay">decayed</a>. Because of this, the berkelium target had to be quickly transported to Russia; for the experiment to be viable, it had to be completed within six months of its departure from the United States. The target was packed into five lead containers to be flown from New York to Moscow.

Russian customs officials twice refused to let the target enter the country because of missing or incomplete paperwork. Over the span of a few days, the target traveled over the Atlantic Ocean five times. On its arrival in Russia in June 2009, the berkelium was transferred to <a href="Research%20Institute%20of%20Atomic%20Reactors">Research Institute of Atomic Reactors</a> (RIAR) in <a href="Dimitrovgrad%20%28Russia%29">Dimitrovgrad</a>, <a href="Ulyanovsk%20Oblast">Ulyanovsk Oblast</a>, where it was deposited as a 300-<a href="nanometer">nanometer</a>-thin layer on a <a href="titanium">titanium</a> film. In July 2009, it was then transported to Dubna, where it was installed in the <a href="particle%20accelerator">particle accelerator</a> at JINR. The calcium-48 beam was generated by <a href="extraction%20%28chemistry%29">chemically extracting</a> the small quantities of calcium-48 present in naturally occurring calcium, enriching it 500 times. This work was done in the <a href="Closed%20city">closed town</a> of <a href="Lesnoy%2C%20Sverdlovsk%20Oblast">Lesnoy</a>, <a href="Sverdlovsk%20Oblast">Sverdlovsk Oblast</a>, Russia.

The experiment began late July 2009. In January 2010, scientists at the <a href="Flerov%20Laboratory%20of%20Nuclear%20Reactions">Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions</a> announced internally that they had detected the <a href="Radioactive%20decay">decay</a> of a new element with atomic number 117 via two decay chains: one of an <a href="odd-odd%20nuclei">odd-odd</a> isotope undergoing 6 <a href="alpha%20decay">alpha decay</a>s before <a href="spontaneous%20fission">spontaneous fission</a>, and one of an <a href="odd-even%20nuclei">odd-even isotope</a> undergoing 3 alpha decays before fission. The obtained data from the experiment was sent to the LLNL for further analysis. On April 9, 2010, an official report was released in the journal "<a href="Physical%20Review%20Letters">Physical Review Letters</a>" identifying the isotopes as 117 and 117, which were shown to have half-lives on the <a href="order%20of%20magnitude">order</a> of tens or hundreds of <a href="millisecond">millisecond</a>s. The work was signed by all parties involved in the experiment to some extent: JINR, ORNL, LLNL, RIAR, Vanderbilt, the University of Tennessee, and the <a href="University%20of%20Nevada%2C%20Las%20Vegas">University of Nevada</a> (<a href="Las%20Vegas%2C%20Nevada">Las Vegas</a>, <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a>, U.S.), which provided data analysis support. The isotopes were formed as follows:

All <a href="daughter%20isotope">daughter isotope</a>s (decay products) of element 117 were previously unknown; therefore, their properties could not be used to confirm the claim of discovery. In 2011, when one of the decay products (115) was synthesized directly, its properties matched those measured in the claimed indirect synthesis from the decay of element 117. The discoverers did not submit a claim for their findings in 2007–2011 when the <a href="IUPAC/IUPAP%20Joint%20Working%20Party">Joint Working Party</a> was reviewing claims of discoveries of new elements.

The Dubna team repeated the experiment in 2012, creating seven atoms of element 117 and confirming their earlier synthesis of element 118 (produced after some time when a significant quantity of the berkelium-249 target had <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a>ed to californium-249). The results of the experiment matched the previous outcome; the scientists then filed an application to register the element. In May 2014, a joint German–American collaboration of scientists from the ORNL and the <a href="GSI%20Helmholtz%20Center%20for%20Heavy%20Ion%20Research">GSI Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research</a> in <a href="Darmstadt">Darmstadt</a>, <a href="Hessen">Hessen</a>, Germany, claimed to have confirmed discovery of the element. The team repeated the Dubna experiment using the Darmstadt accelerator, creating two atoms of element 117.

In December 2015, the JWP officially recognized the discovery of 117 on account of the confirmation of the properties of its daughter 115, and thus the listed discoverers—JINR, LLNL, and ORNL—were given the right to suggest an official name for the element. (Vanderbilt was left off the initial list of discoverers in an error that was later corrected.)

In May 2016, <a href="Lund%20University">Lund University</a> (<a href="Lund">Lund</a>, <a href="Scania">Scania</a>, Sweden) and GSI cast some doubt on the syntheses of elements 115 and 117. The decay chains assigned to 115, the isotope instrumental in the confirmation of the syntheses of elements 115 and 117, were found to be too different to belong to the same nuclide with a reasonably high probability. The reported 117 decay chains approved as such by the JWP were found to require splitting into individual data sets assigned to different isotopes of element 117. It was also found that the claimed link between the decay chains reported as from 117 and 115 probably did not exist. (On the other hand, the chains from the non-approved isotope 117 were found to be <a href="wikt%3Acongruent">congruent</a>.) The multiplicity of states found when nuclides that are not even–even undergo alpha decay is not unexpected and contributes to the lack of clarity in the cross-reactions. This study criticized the JWP report for overlooking subtleties associated with this issue, and noted that the fact that the only argument for the acceptance of the discoveries of elements 115 and 117 was an almost certainly non-existent link was "problematic".

On June 8, 2017, two members of the Dubna team published a journal article answering these criticisms, analysing their data on the nuclides 117 and 115 with widely accepted statistical methods, noted that the 2016 studies indicating non-congruence produced problematic results when applied to radioactive decay: they excluded from the 90% confidence interval both average and extreme decay times, and the decay chains that would be excluded from the 90% confidence interval they chose were more probable to be observed than those that would be included. The 2017 reanalysis concluded that the observed decay chains of 117 and 115 were consistent with the assumption that only one nuclide was present at each step of the chain, although it would be desirable to be able to directly measure the mass number of the originating nucleus of each chain as well as the excitation function of the Am+Ca reaction.

Using <a href="Mendeleev%27s%20predicted%20elements">Mendeleev's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements</a>, element 117 should be known as "eka-<a href="astatine">astatine</a>". Using the 1979 <a href="systematic%20element%20name">recommendations</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Pure%20and%20Applied%20Chemistry">International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry</a> (IUPAC), the element was <a href="placeholder%20name">temporarily called</a> "ununseptium" (symbol "Uus") until its discovery was confirmed and a permanent name chosen; the temporary name was formed from <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> roots "one", "one", and "seven", a reference to the element's atomic number of 117. Many scientists in the field called it "element 117", with the symbol "E117", "(117)", or "117". According to guidelines of IUPAC valid at the moment of the discovery approval, the permanent names of new elements should have ended in "-ium"; this included element 117, even if the element was a <a href="halogen">halogen</a>, which traditionally have names ending in "-ine"; however, the new recommendations published in 2016 recommended using the "-ine" ending for all new group 17 elements. The IUPAC guidelines specify that the discovery team has naming rights for the element.

After the original synthesis in 2010, <a href="Dawn%20Shaughnessy">Dawn Shaughnessy</a> of LLNL and Oganessian declared that naming was a sensitive question, and it was avoided as far as possible. However, Hamilton declared that year, "I was crucial in getting the group together and in getting the Bk target essential for the discovery. As a result of that, I’m going to get to name the element. I can’t tell you the name, but it will bring distinction to the region." (Hamilton teaches at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.)
In March 2016, the discovery team agreed on a conference call involving representatives from the parties involved on the name "tennessine" for element 117. In June 2016, IUPAC published a declaration stating the discoverers had submitted their suggestions for naming the new elements 115, 117, and 118 to the IUPAC; the suggestion for the element 117 was "tennessine", with a symbol of "Ts", after "the region of Tennessee". The suggested names were recommended for acceptance by the IUPAC Inorganic Chemistry Division; formal acceptance was set to occur after a five-months term following publishing of the declaration expires. In November 2016, the names, including tennessine, were formally accepted. Concerns that the proposed symbol "Ts" may clash with a notation for the <a href="tosyl">tosyl</a> group used in organic chemistry were rejected, following existing symbols bearing such dual meanings: Ac (<a href="actinium">actinium</a> and <a href="Acetyl%20group">acetyl</a>) and Pr (<a href="praseodymium">praseodymium</a> and <a href="Propyl%20group">propyl</a>). The naming ceremony for moscovium, tennessine, and oganesson was held in March 2017 at the <a href="Russian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Russian Academy of Sciences</a> in <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a>; a separate ceremony for tennessine alone had been held at ORNL in January 2017.

The stability of nuclei quickly decreases with the increase in atomic number after <a href="curium">curium</a>, element 96, whose half-life is four orders of magnitude longer than that of any subsequent element. All isotopes with an atomic number above <a href="mendelevium">101</a> undergo radioactive decay with half-lives of less than 30 hours. No elements with atomic numbers above 82 (after <a href="lead">lead</a>) have stable isotopes. This is because of the ever-increasing Coulomb repulsion of protons, so that the <a href="strong%20nuclear%20force">strong nuclear force</a> cannot hold the nucleus together against <a href="spontaneous%20fission">spontaneous fission</a> for long. Calculations suggest that in the absence of other stabilizing factors, elements with more than <a href="rutherfordium">104 protons</a> should not exist. However, researchers in the 1960s suggested that the closed <a href="nuclear%20shell%20model">nuclear shells</a> around 114 protons and 184 neutrons should counteract this instability, creating an "<a href="island%20of%20stability">island of stability</a>" where nuclides could have half-lives reaching thousands or millions of years. While scientists have still not reached the island, the mere existence of the <a href="superheavy%20element">superheavy element</a>s (including tennessine) confirms that this stabilizing effect is real, and in general the known superheavy nuclides become exponentially longer-lived as they approach the predicted location of the island. Tennessine is the second-heaviest element created so far, and all its known isotopes have half-lives of less than one second. Nevertheless, this is longer than the values predicted prior to their discovery. The Dubna team believes that the synthesis of the element is direct experimental proof of the existence of the island of stability.

It has been calculated that the isotope Ts would have a half-life of about 18 <a href="millisecond">millisecond</a>s, and it may be possible to produce this isotope via the same berkelium–calcium reaction used in the discoveries of the known isotopes, Ts and Ts. The chance of this reaction producing Ts is estimated to be, at most, one-seventh the chance of producing Ts. Calculations using a <a href="quantum%20tunneling">quantum tunneling</a> model predict the existence of several isotopes of tennessine up to Ts. The most stable of these is expected to be Ts with an alpha-decay half-life of 40 milliseconds. A <a href="Semi-empirical%20mass%20formula%23The%20liquid%20drop%20model%20and%20its%20analysis">liquid drop model</a> study on the element's isotopes shows similar results; it suggests a general trend of increasing stability for isotopes heavier than Ts, with <a href="partial%20half-life">partial half-lives</a> exceeding the <a href="age%20of%20the%20universe">age of the universe</a> for the heaviest isotopes like Ts when beta decay is not considered. Lighter isotopes of tennessine may be produced in the Am+Ti reaction, which was considered as a contingency plan by the Dubna team in 2008 if Bk proved unavailable, and may be studied again in the near future (2017–2018) to investigate the properties of nuclear reactions with a titanium-50 beam, which becomes necessary to synthesize elements beyond oganesson.
Tennessine is expected to be a member of group 17 in the periodic table, below the five halogens; <a href="fluorine">fluorine</a>, <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a>, <a href="bromine">bromine</a>, <a href="iodine">iodine</a>, and astatine, each of which has seven valence electrons with a configuration of . For tennessine, being in the seventh <a href="period%20%28chemistry%29">period</a> (row) of the periodic table, continuing the trend would predict a valence electron configuration of , and it would therefore be expected to behave similarly to the halogens in many respects that relate to this electronic state. However, going down group 17, the metallicity of the elements increases; for example, iodine already exhibits a metallic luster in the solid state, and astatine is often classified as a <a href="metalloid">metalloid</a> due to its properties being quite far from those of the four previous halogens. As such, an extrapolation based on periodic trends would predict tennessine to be a rather volatile <a href="post-transition%20metal">post-transition metal</a>.

Calculations have confirmed the accuracy of this simple extrapolation, although experimental verification of this is currently impossible as the half-lives of the known tennessine isotopes are too short. Significant differences between tennessine and the previous halogens are likely to arise, largely due to <a href="spin%E2%80%93orbit%20interaction">spin–orbit interaction</a> — the mutual interaction between the motion and <a href="spin%20%28physics%29">spin</a> of electrons. The spin–orbit interaction is especially strong for the superheavy elements because their electrons move faster — at velocities comparable to the <a href="speed%20of%20light">speed of light</a> — than those in lighter atoms. In tennessine atoms, this lowers the 7s and the 7p electron energy levels, stabilizing the corresponding electrons, although two of the 7p electron energy levels are more stabilized than the other four. The stabilization of the 7s electrons is called the <a href="inert%20pair%20effect">inert pair effect</a>; the effect that separates the 7p subshell into the more-stabilized and the less-stabilized parts is called subshell splitting. Computational chemists understand the split as a change of the second (<a href="azimuthal%20quantum%20number">azimuthal</a>) <a href="quantum%20number">quantum number</a> "l" from 1 to 1/2 and 3/2 for the more-stabilized and less-stabilized parts of the 7p subshell, respectively. For many theoretical purposes, the valence electron configuration may be represented to reflect the 7p subshell split as .

Differences for other electron levels also exist. For example, the 6d electron levels (also split in two, with four being 6d and six being 6d) are both raised, so they are close in energy to the 7s ones, although no 6d electron chemistry has been predicted for tennessine. The difference between the 7p and 7p levels is abnormally high; 9.8 <a href="electronvolt">eV</a>. Astatine's 6p subshell split is only 3.8 eV, and its 6p chemistry has already been called "limited". These effects cause tennessine's chemistry to differ from those of its upper neighbors (see <a href="%23Chemical">below</a>).

Tennessine's first <a href="ionization%20energy">ionization energy</a>—the energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom—is predicted to be 7.7 eV, lower than those of the halogens, again following the trend. Like its neighbors in the periodic table, tennessine is expected to have the lowest <a href="electron%20affinity">electron affinity</a>—energy released when an electron is added to the atom—in its group; 2.6 or 1.8 eV. The electron of the hypothetical <a href="hydrogen-like%20atom">hydrogen-like</a> tennessine atom—oxidized so it has only one electron, Ts—is predicted to move so quickly that its mass is 1.9 times that of a non-moving electron, a feature attributable to <a href="Relativistic%20quantum%20chemistry">relativistic effects</a>. For comparison, the figure for hydrogen-like astatine is 1.27 and the figure for hydrogen-like iodine is 1.08. Simple extrapolations of relativity laws indicate a contraction of <a href="atomic%20radius">atomic radius</a>. Advanced calculations show that the radius of an tennessine atom that has formed one covalent bond would be 165 <a href="picometer">pm</a>, while that of astatine would be 147 pm. With the seven outermost electrons removed, tennessine is finally smaller; 57 pm for tennessine and 61 pm for astatine.

The melting and boiling points of tennessine are not known; earlier papers predicted about 350–500 °C and 550 °C, respectively, or 350–550 °C and 610 °C, respectively. These values exceed those of astatine and the lighter halogens, following <a href="periodic%20trends">periodic trends</a>. A later paper predicts the boiling point of tennessine to be 345 °C (that of astatine is estimated as 309 °C, 337 °C, or 370 °C, although experimental values of 230 °C and 411 °C have been reported). The density of tennessine is expected to be between 7.1 and 7.3 g/cm, continuing the trend of increasing density among the halogens; that of astatine is estimated to be between 6.2 and 6.5 g/cm.

The known isotopes of tennessine, Ts and Ts, are too short-lived to allow for chemical experimentation at present. Nevertheless, many chemical properties of tennessine have been calculated. Unlike the previous group 17 elements, tennessine may not exhibit the chemical behavior common to the halogens. For example, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine routinely accept an electron to achieve the more stable <a href="electronic%20configuration">electronic configuration</a> of a <a href="noble%20gas">noble gas</a>, obtaining eight electrons (<a href="octet%20rule">octet</a>) in their valence shells instead of seven. This ability weakens as atomic weight increases going down the group; tennessine would be the least willing group 17 element to accept an electron. Of the oxidation states it is predicted to form, −1 is expected to be the least common. The <a href="standard%20reduction%20potential">standard reduction potential</a> of the Ts/Ts couple is predicted to be −0.25 V; this value is negative and thus tennessine should not be reduced to the −1 oxidation state under standard conditions, unlike all the previous halogens.

There is another opportunity for tennessine to complete its octet—by forming a <a href="covalent%20bond">covalent bond</a>. Like the halogens, when two tennessine atoms meet they are expected to form a Ts–Ts bond to give a <a href="diatomic%20molecule">diatomic molecule</a>. Such molecules are commonly bound via single <a href="sigma%20bond">sigma bond</a>s between the atoms; these are different from <a href="pi%20bond">pi bond</a>s, which are divided into two parts, each shifted in a direction perpendicular to the line between the atoms, and opposite one another rather than being located directly between the atoms they bind. Sigma bonding has been calculated to show a great <a href="antibonding">antibonding</a> character in the At molecule and is not as favorable energetically. Tennessine is predicted to continue the trend; a strong pi character should be seen in the bonding of Ts. The molecule tennessine chloride (TsCl) is predicted to go further, being bonded with a single pi bond.

Aside from the unstable −1 state, three more oxidation states are predicted; +5, +3, and +1. The +1 state should be especially stable because of the destabilization of the three outermost 7p electrons, forming a stable, half-filled subshell configuration; astatine shows similar effects. The +3 state should be important, again due to the destabilized 7p electrons. The +5 state is predicted to be uncommon because the 7p electrons are oppositely stabilized. The +7 state has not been shown—even computationally—to be achievable. Because the 7s electrons are greatly stabilized, it has been hypothesized that tennessine effectively has only five valence electrons.

The simplest possible tennessine compound would be the monohydride, TsH. The bonding is expected to be provided by a 7p electron of tennessine and the 1s electron of hydrogen. The non-bonding nature of the 7p <a href="spinor">spinor</a> is because tennessine is expected not to form purely sigma or pi bonds. Therefore, the destabilized (thus expanded) 7p spinor is responsible for bonding. This effect lengthens the TsH molecule by 17 picometers compared with the overall length of 195 pm. Since the tennessine p electron bonds are two-thirds sigma, the bond is only two-thirds as strong as it would be if tennessine featured no spin–orbit interactions. The molecule thus follows the trend for halogen hydrides, showing an increase in bond length and a decrease in dissociation energy compared to AtH. The molecules <a href="thallium">Tl</a>Ts and <a href="Nihonium">Nh</a>Ts may be viewed analogously, taking into account an opposite effect shown by the fact that the element's p electrons are stabilized. These two characteristics result in a relatively small <a href="electric%20dipole%20moment">dipole moment</a> (product of difference between electric charges of atoms and <a href="displacement%20%28vector%29">displacement</a> of the atoms) for TlTs; only 1.67 <a href="debye%20%28unit%29">D</a>, the positive value implying that the negative charge is on the tennessine atom. For NhTs, the strength of the effects are predicted to cause a transfer of the electron from the tennessine atom to the nihonium atom, with the dipole moment value being −1.80 D. The spin–orbit interaction increases the dissociation energy of the TsF molecule because it lowers the electronegativity of tennessine, causing the bond with the extremely electronegative fluorine atom to have a more <a href="ionic%20bond">ionic</a> character. Tennessine monofluoride should feature the strongest bonding of all group 17 monofluorides.

<a href="VSEPR%20theory">VSEPR theory</a> predicts a <a href="T-shaped%20molecular%20geometry">bent-T-shaped</a> <a href="molecular%20geometry">molecular geometry</a> for the group 17 trifluorides. All known halogen trifluorides have this molecular geometry and have a structure of AXE—a central atom, denoted A, surrounded by three <a href="ligand">ligand</a>s, X, and two unshared <a href="electron%20pair">electron pair</a>s, E. If relativistic effects are ignored, TsF should follow its lighter <a href="Congener%20%28chemistry%29">congeners</a> in having a bent-T-shaped molecular geometry. More sophisticated predictions show that this molecular geometry would not be energetically favored for TsF, predicting instead a <a href="trigonal%20planar%20molecular%20geometry">trigonal planar molecular geometry</a> (AXE). This shows that VSEPR theory may not be consistent for the superheavy elements. The TsF molecule is predicted to be significantly stabilized by spin–orbit interactions; a possible rationale may be the large difference in electronegativity between tennessine and fluorine, giving the bond a partially ionic character.
