Ficus aurea

Ficus aurea, commonly known as the Florida strangler fig (or simply strangler fig), golden fig, or higuerón, is a tree in the family <a href="Moraceae">Moraceae</a> that is native to the U.S. state of <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, the northern and western <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, southern <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> and <a href="Central%20America">Central America</a> south to <a href="Panama">Panama</a>. The specific epithet "aurea" was applied by English botanist <a href="Thomas%20Nuttall">Thomas Nuttall</a> who described the species in 1846.

"Ficus aurea" is a <a href="strangler%20fig">strangler fig</a>. In <a href="Ficus">fig</a>s of this group, seed germination usually takes place in the canopy of a <a href="host%20%28biology%29">host</a> tree with the seedling living as an <a href="epiphyte">epiphyte</a> until its roots establish contact with the ground. After that, it enlarges and strangles its host, eventually becoming a free-standing tree in its own right. Individuals may reach in height. Like all figs, it has an obligate <a href="Mutualism%20%28biology%29">mutualism</a> with <a href="fig%20wasp">fig wasp</a>s: figs are only pollinated by fig wasps, and fig wasps can only reproduce in fig flowers. The tree provides habitat, food and shelter for a host of tropical lifeforms including epiphytes in <a href="cloud%20forests">cloud forests</a> and <a href="bird">bird</a>s, <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s, <a href="reptile">reptile</a>s and <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s. "F. aurea" is used in <a href="traditional%20medicine">traditional medicine</a>, for <a href="Hedge%23Live%20fencing">live fencing</a>, as an <a href="Ornamental%20plant">ornamental</a> and as a <a href="bonsai">bonsai</a>

"Ficus aurea" is a tree which may reach heights of . It is <a href="Plant%20sexuality">monoecious</a>: each tree bears functional male and female flowers. The size and shape of the leaves is variable. Some plants have leaves that are usually less than 10 cm (4 in) long while others have leaves that are larger. The <a href="Leaf%20shape">shape of the leaves</a> and of the <a href="Leaf%23Base%20of%20the%20leaf">leaf base</a> also varies—some plants have leaves that are oblong or elliptic with a wedge-shaped to rounded base, while others have heart-shaped or ovate leaves with <a href="cordate">cordate</a> to rounded bases. "F. aurea" has paired figs which are green when unripe, turning yellow as they ripen. They differ in size (0.6–0.8 cm [0.2–0.3 in], about 1 cm [0.4 in], or 1.0–1.2 cm [0.4–0.5 in] in diameter); figs are generally <a href="Sessility%20%28botany%29">sessile</a>, but in parts of northern <a href="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a> figs are borne on short stalks known as <a href="peduncle%20%28botany%29">peduncles</a>.

With about 750 species, "<a href="Ficus">Ficus</a>" (<a href="Moraceae">Moraceae</a>) is one of the largest <a href="angiosperm">angiosperm</a> genera (David Frodin of <a href="Chelsea%20Physic%20Garden">Chelsea Physic Garden</a> ranked it as the 31st largest genus). "Ficus aurea" is classified in the <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a> "Urostigma" (the strangler figs) and the <a href="section%20%28botany%29">section</a> "Americana". Recent molecular <a href="Phylogenetics">phylogenies</a> have shown that subgenus "Urostigma" is <a href="polyphyletic">polyphyletic</a>, but have strongly supported the validity of section "Americana" as a <a href="clade">discrete group</a> (although its exact relationship to section "Galoglychia" is unclear).
<a href="Thomas%20Nuttall">Thomas Nuttall</a> described the species in the second volume of his 1846 work "The North American Sylva" with specific epithet "aurea" ('golden' in <a href="Latin">Latin</a>). In 1768, Scottish botanist <a href="Philip%20Miller">Philip Miller</a> described "<a href="Ficus%20maxima">Ficus maxima</a>", citing <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a>' "<a href="Hortus%20Cliffortianus">Hortus Cliffortianus</a>" (1738) and <a href="Hans%20Sloane">Hans Sloane</a>'s "Catalogus plantarum quæ in insula Jamaica" (1696). Sloane's illustration of the species, published in 1725, depicted it with figs borne singly, a characteristic of the "Ficus" subgenus "<a href="Pharmacosycea">Pharmacosycea</a>". As a member of the subgenus "<a href="Urostigma">Urostigma</a>", "F. aurea" has paired figs. However, a closer examination of Sloane's description led Cornelis Berg to conclude that the illustration depicted a member of the subgenus "Urostigma" (since it had other diagnostic of that subgenus), almost certainly "F. aurea", and that the illustration of singly borne figs was probably <a href="artistic%20license">artistic license</a>. Berg located the plant collection upon which Sloane's illustration was based and concluded that Miller's "F. maxima" was, in fact, "F. aurea". In his description of "F. aurea", which was based on plant material collected in Florida, Thomas Nuttall considered the possibility that his plants belonged to the species that Sloane had described, but came to the conclusion that it was a new species. Under the rules of <a href="botanical%20nomenclature">botanical nomenclature</a>, the name "F. maxima" has priority over "F. aurea" since Miller's description was published in 1768, while Nuttall's description was published in 1846.

In their 1914 "Flora of Jamaica", <a href="William%20Fawcett%20%28botanist%29">William Fawcett</a> and <a href="Alfred%20Barton%20Rendle">Alfred Barton Rendle</a> linked Sloane's illustration to the tree species that was then known as "Ficus suffocans", a name that had been assigned to it in <a href="August%20Grisebach">August Grisebach</a>'s "Flora of the British West Indian Islands". Gordon DeWolf agreed with their conclusion and used the name "F. maxima" for that species in the 1960 "Flora of Panama". Since this use has become widespread, Berg proposed that the name "Ficus maxima" be <a href="Conserved%20name">conserved</a> in the way DeWolf had used it, a proposal that was accepted by the nomenclatural committee.

Reassigning the name "Ficus maxima" did not leave "F. aurea" as the oldest name for this species, as German naturalist <a href="Johann%20Heinrich%20Friedrich%20Link">Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link</a> had described "Ficus ciliolosa" in 1822. Berg concluded that the species Link described was actually "F. aurea", and since Link's description predated Nuttall's by 24 years, priority should have been given to the name "F. ciliolosa". Since the former name was widely used and the name "F. ciliolosa" had not been, Berg proposed that the name "F. aurea" be conserved. In response to this, the nomenclatural committee ruled that rather than conserving "F. aurea", that it would be better to reject "F. ciliolosa". Conserving "F. aurea" would mean that precedence would be given to that name over all others. By simply rejecting "F. ciliolosa", the committee left open the possibility that the name "F. aurea" could be supplanted by another older name, if one were to be discovered.

In 1920, American botanist <a href="Paul%20Carpenter%20Standley">Paul C. Standley</a> described three new species based on collections from Panama and Costa Rica—"Ficus tuerckheimii", "F. isophlebia" and "F. jimenezii". DeWolf concluded that they were all the same species, and Berg synonymised them with "F. aurea". These names have been used widely for Mexican and Central American populations, and continue to be used by some authors. Berg suspected that "Ficus rzedowskiana" Carvajal and Cuevas-Figueroa may also belong to this species, but he had not examined the original material upon which this species was based.

Berg considered "F. aurea" to be a species with at least four <a href="Polymorphism%20%28biology%29">morphs</a>. "None of the morphs", he wrote, "can be related to certain habitats or altitudes." Thirty years earlier, William Burger had come to a very different conclusion with respect to "Ficus tuerckheimii", "F. isophlebia" and "F. jimenezii"—he rejected DeWolf's synonymisation of these three species as based on incomplete evidence. Burger noted that the three taxa occupied different habitats which could be separated in terms of rainfall and elevation.

Figs have an obligate <a href="Mutualism%20%28biology%29">mutualism</a> with <a href="fig%20wasp">fig wasp</a>s, (Agaonidae); figs are only pollinated by fig wasps, and fig wasps can only reproduce in fig flowers. Generally, each fig species depends on a single species of wasp for pollination. The wasps are similarly dependent on their fig species in order to reproduce. "Ficus aurea" is pollinated by "<a href="Pegoscapus%20mexicanus">Pegoscapus mexicanus</a>" (<a href="William%20Harris%20Ashmead">Ashmead</a>).

Figs have complicated <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s called <a href="syconium">syconia</a>. Flowers are entirely contained within an enclosed structure. Their only connection with the outside is through a small pore called <a href="ostiole">ostiole</a>. <a href="Monoecious">Monoecious</a> figs like "F. aurea" have both male and female flowers within the syconium. Female flowers mature first. Once mature, they produce a <a href="Volatility%20%28chemistry%29">volatile</a> chemical attractant. Female wasps squeeze their way through the ostiole into the interior of the syconium. Inside the syconium, they pollinate the flowers, lay their eggs in some of them, and die. The eggs hatch and the larvae parasitise the flowers in which they were laid. After four to seven weeks (in "F. aurea"), adult wasps emerge. Males emerge first, mate with the females, and cut exit holes through the walls of the fig. The male flowers mature around the same time as the female wasps emerge. The newly emerged female wasps actively pack their bodies with pollen from the male flowers before leaving through the exit holes the males have cut and fly off to find a syconium in which to lay their eggs. Over the next one to five days, figs ripen. The ripe figs are eaten by various mammals and birds which <a href="seed%20dispersal">disperse</a> the seeds.

Figs flower and fruit asynchronously. Flowering and fruiting is staggered throughout the population. This fact is important for fig wasps—female wasps need to find a syconium in which to lay their eggs within a few days of emergence, something that would not be possible if all the trees in a population flowered and fruited at the same time. This also makes figs important food resources for <a href="frugivore">frugivore</a>s (animals that feed nearly exclusively on fruit); figs are one of the few fruit available at times of the year when fruit are scarce.

Although figs flower asynchronously as a population, in most species flowering is synchronised within an individual. Newly emerged female wasps must move away from their natal tree in order to find figs in which to lay their eggs. This is to the advantage of the fig, since it prevents <a href="self-pollination">self-pollination</a>. In Florida, individual "F. aurea" trees flower and fruit asynchronously. Within-tree asynchrony in flowering is likely to raise the probability of self-pollination, but it may be an adaptation that allows the species to maintain an adequate population of wasps at low population densities or in strongly seasonal climates.

Flowering <a href="phenology">phenology</a> in "Ficus" has been characterised into five phases. In most figs, phase A is followed almost immediately by phase B. However, in "F. aurea" immature inflorescences can remain dormant for more than nine months.

"Ficus aurea" is a fast-growing tree. As a <a href="hemiepiphyte">hemiepiphyte</a> it <a href="Germination">germinates</a> in the <a href="Canopy%20%28forest%29">canopy</a> of a host tree and begins life as an <a href="epiphyte">epiphyte</a> before growing roots down to the ground. "F. aurea" is also a <a href="strangler%20fig">strangler fig</a> (not all hemiepiphytic figs are stranglers)—the roots <a href="anastomosis">fuse</a> and encircle the host tree. This usually results in the death of the host tree, since it effectively <a href="girdling">girdles</a> the tree. <a href="Arecaceae">Palms</a>, which lack <a href="secondary%20growth">secondary growth</a>, are not affected by this, but they can still be harmed by competition for light, water and nutrients. Following <a href="Hurricane%20Andrew">Hurricane Andrew</a> in 1992, "F. aurea" trees regenerated from <a href="Basal%20shoot">root suckers</a> and standing trees.

"Ficus aurea" ranges from Florida, across the northern Caribbean to Mexico, and south across Central America. It is present in central and southern Florida and the <a href="Florida%20Keys">Florida Keys</a>, The Bahamas, the Caicos Islands, Hispaniola, Cuba, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, <a href="Archipelago%20of%20San%20Andr%C3%A9s%2C%20Providencia%20and%20Santa%20Catalina">San Andrés</a> (a Colombian possession in the western Caribbean), southern Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Panama. It grows from sea level up to 1,800 m (5,500 ft) <a href="above%20sea%20level">above sea level</a>, in habitats ranging from <a href="Bahamian%20dry%20forests">Bahamian dry forests</a>, to <a href="cloud%20forest">cloud forest</a> in Costa Rica.

"Ficus aurea" is found in central and southern Florida as far north as <a href="Volusia%20County%2C%20Florida">Volusia County</a>; it is one of only two native fig species in Florida. The species is present in a range of south Florida ecosystems, including coastal hardwood <a href="hammock%20%28ecology%29">hammocks</a>, <a href="Sabal%20palmetto">cabbage palm</a> hammocks,
<a href="tropical%20hardwood%20hammocks">tropical hardwood hammocks</a> and shrublands, temperate hardwood hammocks and shrublands and along watercourses. In The Bahamas, "F. aurea" is found in <a href="Bahamian%20dry%20forests">tropical dry forests</a> on <a href="North%20Andros">North Andros</a>, <a href="Great%20Exuma">Great Exuma</a> and <a href="Bimini">Bimini</a>. "F. aurea" occurs in 10 <a href="Administrative%20divisions%20of%20Mexico%23States">states</a> in Mexico, primarily in the south, but extending as far north as <a href="Jalisco">Jalisco</a>. It is found in tropical deciduous forest, tropical semi-evergreen forest, tropical evergreen forest, cloud forest and in aquatic or subaquatic habitats.

"Ficus aurea" is a strangler fig—it tends to establish on a host tree which it gradually encircles and "strangles", eventually taking the place of that tree in the forest canopy. While this makes "F. aurea" an agent in the mortality of other trees, there is little to indicate that its choice of hosts is species specific. However, in <a href="Bahamian%20dry%20forests">dry forests</a> on <a href="Great%20Exuma">Great Exuma</a> in The Bahamas, "F. aurea" establishes exclusively on <a href="Arecaceae">palms</a>, in spite of the presence of several other large trees that should provide suitable hosts. Eric Swagel and colleagues attributed this to the fact that <a href="humus">humus</a> accumulates on the leaf bases of these palms and provides a relatively moist <a href="microclimate">microclimate</a> in a dry environment, facilitating seedling survival.

Figs are sometimes considered to be potential <a href="keystone%20species">keystone species</a> in communities of <a href="frugivore">fruit-eating animals</a> because of their <a href="wikt%3Aasynchrony">asynchronous</a> fruiting patterns. Nathaniel Wheelwright reports that <a href="emerald%20toucanet">emerald toucanet</a>s fed on unripe "F. aurea" fruit at times of fruit scarcity in <a href="Monteverde">Monteverde</a>, <a href="Costa%20Rica">Costa Rica</a>. Wheelwright listed the species as a year-round food source for the <a href="resplendent%20quetzal">resplendent quetzal</a> at the same site. In the <a href="Florida%20Keys">Florida Keys</a>, "F. aurea" is one of five fruit species that dominate the diet fed by <a href="white-crowned%20pigeon">white-crowned pigeon</a>s to their nestlings. "F. aurea" is also important in the diet of mammalian frugivores—both fruit and young leaves are consumed by <a href="Guatemalan%20Black%20Howler">black howler monkeys</a> in Belize.

The interaction between figs and <a href="fig%20wasp">fig wasp</a>s is especially well-known (see section on <a href="Ficus%20aurea%23Reproduction%20and%20growth">reproduction</a>, above). In addition to its pollinators ("Pegoscapus mexicanus"), "F. aurea" is exploited by a group of non-pollinating <a href="Chalcid%20wasp">chalcidoid wasps</a> whose larvae develop in its figs. These include <a href="gall">gall</a>ers, <a href="inquiline">inquiline</a>s and <a href="kleptoparasite">kleptoparasite</a>s as well as <a href="parasitoid">parasitoid</a>s of both the pollinating and non-pollinating wasps.

The invertebrates within "F. aurea" syconia in southern Florida include a pollinating wasp, "P. mexicanus", up to eight or more species of non-pollinating wasps, a plant-parasitic nematode transported by the pollinator, mites, and a predatory rove beetle whose adults and larvae eat fig wasps.
Nematodes: "Schistonchus aureus" (Aphelenchoididae) is a plant-parasitic nematode associated with the pollinator "Pegoscapus mexicanus" and syconia of "F. aurea". 
Mites: belonging to the family Tarsonemidae (Acarina) have been recognized in the syconia of "F. aurea" and "F. citrifolia", but they have not been identified even to genus, and their behavior is undescribed.
Rove beetles: "Charoxus spinifer" is a rove beetle (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) whose adults enter late-stage syconia of "F. aurea" and "F. citrifolia". Adults eat fig wasps; larvae develop within the syconia and prey on fig wasps, then pupate in the ground.

As a large tree, "F. aurea" can be an important host for <a href="epiphyte">epiphyte</a>s. In Costa Rican cloud forests, where "F. aurea" is "the most conspicuous component" of intact forest, trees in forest patches supported richer communities of epiphytic <a href="bryophyte">bryophyte</a>s, while isolated trees supported greater <a href="lichen">lichen</a> cover.

<a href="Florida%20International%20University">Florida International University</a> ecologist Suzanne Koptur reported the presence of <a href="Nectar%23Extrafloral%20nectaries">extrafloral nectaries</a> on "F. aurea" figs in the Florida <a href="Everglades">Everglades</a>. Extrafloral nectaries are structures which produce <a href="nectar">nectar</a> but are not associated with flowers. They are usually interpreted as defensive structure and are often produced in response to attack by insect <a href="herbivore">herbivore</a>s. They attract insects, primarily <a href="ant">ant</a>s, which defend the nectaries, thus protecting the plant against herbivores.

The fruit of "Ficus aurea" is edible and was used for food by the indigenous people and early settlers in Florida; it is still eaten occasionally as a backyard source of native fruit. The latex was used to make a chewing gum, and aerial roots may have been used to make lashings, arrows, bowstrings and fishing lines. The fruit was used to make a rose-coloured dye. "F. aurea" was also used in <a href="traditional%20medicine">traditional medicine</a> in The Bahamas and Florida. Allison Adonizio and colleagues screened "F. aurea" for anti-<a href="quorum%20sensing">quorum sensing</a> activity (as a possible means of anti-bacterial action), but found no such activity.

Individual "F. aurea" trees are common on dairy farms in La Cruz, Cañitas and <a href="Santa%20Elena%2C%20Costa%20Rica">Santa Elena</a> in Costa Rica, since they are often spared when forest is converted to <a href="pasture">pasture</a>. In interviews, farmers identified the species as useful for fence posts, <a href="Hedge%23Live%20fencing">live fencing</a> and firewood, and as a food species for wild birds and mammals.

"Ficus aurea" is used as an <a href="Ornamental%20plant">ornamental tree</a>, an <a href="Houseplant">indoor tree</a> and as a <a href="bonsai">bonsai</a>. Like other figs, it tends to invade built structures and foundations, and need to be removed to prevent structural damage. Although young trees are described as "rather ornamental", older trees are considered to be difficult to maintain (because of the <a href="adventitious%20roots">adventitious roots</a> that develop off branches) and are not recommended for small areas. However, it was considered a useful tree for "enviroscaping" to conserve energy in south Florida, since it is "not as aggressive as many exotic fig species," although it must be given enough space.

Faryl Smith

Faryl Smith (born 23 July 1995) is a British <a href="soprano">soprano</a> who rose to fame after appearing on the second series of the <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a> television talent show "<a href="Britain%27s%20Got%20Talent">Britain's Got Talent</a>" in 2008. She received praise throughout the competition, and although the favourite to win after the second round, she finished outside the top three in the live final on 31 May. During the competition, she was tutored by singing coach <a href="Yvie%20Burnett">Yvie Burnett</a> and received offers from various record labels. After the show, she, unlike other finalists, did not sign with <a href="Simon%20Cowell">Simon Cowell</a>'s <a href="Syco">Syco</a>, although she did appear on fellow finalist <a href="Andrew%20Johnston%20%28singer%29">Andrew Johnston</a>'s debut album, "<a href="One%20Voice%20%28Andrew%20Johnston%20album%29">One Voice</a>".

Smith signed a contract with <a href="Universal%20Classics%20and%20Jazz">Universal Classics and Jazz</a> for a £2.3 million advance in December 2008, the largest ever granted to a schoolgirl. Her debut album, "<a href="Faryl">Faryl</a>", was recorded from December 2008 to January 2009 and released in March 2009. "Faryl" became the fastest-selling solo classical album in British chart history, selling 29,200 copies in the first week. It debuted at number six and rose to number four the following week, making Smith the third "Britain's Got Talent" contestant to have a top ten album. In 2010, on account of "Faryl", Smith was nominated for two Classical BRIT Awards and became the youngest artist ever to receive a double nomination.

Smith's second album, "<a href="Wonderland%20%28Faryl%20Smith%20album%29">Wonderland</a>", was released in November 2009. A concept album based on "<a href="Alice%20in%20Wonderland">Alice in Wonderland</a>", the album was well received by critics, but was not successful in the charts. After the release of "Wonderland", Smith's contract with Universal ended. In addition to releasing her albums, she featured on a charity cover of "<a href="The%20Prayer%20%28Celine%20Dion%20and%20Andrea%20Bocelli%20song%29">The Prayer</a>", released in March 2010, provided vocals for the 2012 album "<a href="The%20Magic%20of%20a%20Thousand%20Strings">The Magic of a Thousand Strings</a>" by the <a href="International%20Harp%20Ensemble">International Harp Ensemble</a>, and has performed at numerous events, including the 2009 <a href="Royal%20Variety%20Performance">Royal Variety Performance</a>. Smith currently attends the <a href="Guildhall%20School%20of%20Music%20and%20Drama">Guildhall School of Music and Drama</a> in London, where she is studying music.

Before her appearance on television, Smith had performed competitively in the Kettering, Northamptonshire <a href="Eisteddfod">Eisteddfod</a>, the <a href="Llangollen%20International%20Musical%20Eisteddfod">Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod</a>, the Pontins Junior Starquest competition and Festival 4 Stars. She auditioned for <a href="Britain%27s%20Got%20Talent%20%28Series%202%29">the second series</a> of the <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a> reality show "<a href="Britain%27s%20Got%20Talent">Britain's Got Talent</a>", giving what Jon O'Brien, of <a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a>, called a "mature" performance of "<a href="Ave%20Maria%20%28Bach/Gounod%29">Ave Maria</a>", and was put through to the live shows. <a href="Simon%20Cowell">Simon Cowell</a> described her audition as "the best audition I've heard in years". Before performing live, she and <a href="Andrew%20Johnston%20%28singer%29">Andrew Johnston</a> were favourites to win. She won her semi-final by the public vote, performing a cover of <a href="Sarah%20McLachlan">Sarah McLachlan</a>'s "<a href="Angel%20%28Sarah%20McLachlan%20song%29">Angel</a>". This placed her in the final, and left her as the favourite to win. During her first live show, Cowell described her as "literally one in a million". She then performed in the live final, where she was described by Cowell as one of the five acts (along with <a href="George%20Sampson">George Sampson</a>, Johnston, <a href="Signature%20%28dance%20group%29">Signature</a> and <a href="Kate%20and%20Gin">Kate and Gin</a>) who had a chance of winning. She again performed "Ave Maria", but finished outside the top three. Sampson eventually won the show as a result of the phone-in, with Signature second, and Johnston third. As a result of her final performance of "Ave Maria", Smith was invited to be a guest singer at a songwriting awards ceremony in London. She then went on to perform in the Britain's Got Talent Live Tour with other contestants, where she first performed a duet of "Walking in the Air" with Johnston.

While Smith was competing in Britain's Got Talent, Cowell arranged for her to receive free singing lessons from leading vocal coach <a href="Yvie%20Burnett">Yvie Burnett</a>, who had previously coached 2007 "Britains Got Talent" winner <a href="Paul%20Potts">Paul Potts</a> and 2006 "<a href="The%20X%20Factor%20%28UK%29">The X Factor</a>" winner <a href="Leona%20Lewis">Leona Lewis</a>. The story was broken by "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Mirror">The Sunday Mirror</a>"; writing for the paper, Lara Gould characterised the lessons as "secret", while writers for "<a href="The%20Daily%20Mail">The Daily Mail</a>" claimed that the lessons were "likely to upset fellow contestants", and were evidence that Smith was "already being groomed for stardom". During her participation in the competition, Smith was offered record deals, but she and her family turned them down. Her father, Tony Smith, said "We have had offers from people interested in Faryl. But when Simon Cowell, the big man, says your daughter is special, you listen." Cowell described Smith's potential career during the show, saying "I know she says <a href="Katherine%20Jenkins">Katherine <nowiki>[Jenkins]</nowiki></a> is her idol but she is far better than her. She is by far the most talented youngster I've ever heard. When she opens her mouth her voice is just incredible."

The day after the "Britain's Got Talent" finals, <a href="Max%20Clifford">Max Clifford</a>, speaking for Simon Cowell, said that it was "quite possible" that Cowell would be signing some of the finalists, including Smith. Though she did not sign with <a href="Syco">Syco</a>, Cowell's record label, she did record a duet of "Walking in the Air" with Johnston, which appeared on his debut album, "<a href="One%20Voice%20%28Andrew%20Johnston%20album%29">One Voice</a>", and was tipped as a potential <a href="Christmas%20number-one%20singles%20in%20the%20UK">Christmas number-one</a>. Before the release of "One Voice", it was revealed that Smith and her father, Tony Smith, were finalising the details of her record deal. In November, it was announced that Smith would be performing on stage in Kettering with Sylvia Berryman, a vocal tutor who had worked with Smith prior to her appearance on "Britain's Got Talent". Smith said that she was "really looking forward to singing locally again", and it was again reported that Smith hoped to soon sign her own record deal.

In December 2008 the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" reported that Smith had signed a £2.3 million, multi-album deal with <a href="Universal%20Music%20Group">Universal Music Group</a> that was the "most lucrative recording contract ever handed to a schoolgirl". Smith said "I'm honoured to be joining such a fantastic record company, especially since it's where [Jenkins] started." Dickon Stainer, speaking on behalf of Universal, said "as soon as we saw Faryl, it became an ambition to sign her." Universal claimed it intended to market Smith as a pop star. Smith signed the contract at the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a>, following which she performed with <a href="Katherine%20Jenkins">Katherine Jenkins</a>. Neil Fisher, writing for "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", described Smith as "heir apparent" to Jenkins; the pair had first met when Smith won a competition at the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod. By 2009, Jenkins was acting as a mentor to Smith.

In January 2009 plans were released for Smith to perform with <a href="Pl%C3%A1cido%20Domingo">Plácido Domingo</a>, an idea originally suggested by him. In an interview with the "<a href="Metro%20%28British%20newspaper%29">Metro</a>", Smith talked about her future plans, insisting that she did not wish to be dubbed as the next <a href="Charlotte%20Church">Charlotte Church</a>. She later said that "In the papers, it sounded like I was snobby when I said 'I don't want to be like Charlotte Church', but I didn't mean it like that." She has also spoken of her desire to appear in films on top of her musical career. She said "Films and movies are something I'd really like to do. I've always wanted to act so doing a film would be amazing."

Smith's first album, "Faryl", was recorded at <a href="Air%20Studios">Air Studios</a>, London, in December 2008, during Smith's Christmas holiday; it was completed on 3 January 2009 and features a 60-piece orchestra. Smith described the song "River of Light" by saying that "<a href="The%20Blue%20Danube">The Blue Danube</a>" "music now has words put to it. I like it because it's different. Everyone knows the tune and everybody has got high hopes for it." Smith said that her favourite song on the album was her version of the Welsh hymn, "<a href="Calon%20L%C3%A2n">Calon Lân</a>". Other songs include Smith's version of "<a href="Amazing%20Grace">Amazing Grace</a>", a cover of <a href="John%20Denver">John Denver</a>'s "<a href="Annie%27s%20Song">Annie's Song</a>", and a version of "<a href="The%20Way%20Old%20Friends%20Do">The Way Old Friends Do</a>", rewritten for Smith by <a href="Bj%C3%B6rn%20Ulvaeus">Björn Ulvaeus</a>. Smith spoke about the song, saying "It was about divorce ... They didn't think it was appropriate for me to sing about that, so Björn changed the lyrics so it's about friendship." The album was produced by Jon Cohen, who had previously worked with artists including the <a href="Operababes">Operababes</a> and <a href="Vanessa%20Mae">Vanessa Mae</a>.

Promotion began in January, with performances at the <a href="Mandarin%20Oriental%20Hotel%23The%20Mandarin%20Oriental%2C%20Hyde%20Park">Mandarin Oriental Hotel</a> and appearances at the debut of <a href="Oliver%21%232009%20London%20revival">2009 London revival of "Oliver!"</a>. A television advert and music video for "River of Light" were recorded to further publicise the release, and Smith appeared on the cover of April's "<a href="Classic%20FM%20Magazine">Classic FM Magazine</a>". More promotional appearances in the weeks leading up to the release of "Faryl" included "<a href="Loose%20Women">Loose Women</a>", "<a href="The%20Paul%20O%27Grady%20Show">The Paul O'Grady Show</a>", <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a>, <a href="Radio%20Five%20Live">Radio Five Live</a> and "<a href="BBC%20Breakfast">BBC Breakfast</a>". She also appeared at the <a href="Children%27s%20Champion%20Awards">Children's Champion Awards</a> and met <a href="Gordon%20Brown">Gordon Brown</a> at <a href="10%20Downing%20Street">10 Downing Street</a>. On the day of the release, there was an album signing in Smith's hometown of <a href="Kettering">Kettering</a>, at the <a href="HMV">HMV</a> branch. Smith said "I definitely want to be at home for the launch. I want to be surrounded by my friends and family because obviously, it's a big deal for me."

Pete Paphides, writing for "The Times", said that the songs were performed "with power and restraint" and that the "arrangements by Jon Cohen suggest some kind of aesthetic endeavour beyond the basic thing for which they exist". He compared it favourably to three other <a href="Mothering%20Sunday">Mothering Sunday</a> releases: <a href="Lionel%20Richie">Lionel Richie</a>'s "<a href="Just%20Go%20%28Lionel%20Richie%20album%29">Just Go</a>", <a href="Ronan%20Keating">Ronan Keating</a>'s "<a href="Songs%20for%20My%20Mother">Songs for My Mother</a>" and <a href="Barry%20Manilow">Barry Manilow</a>'s "<a href="The%20Greatest%20Songs%20of%20the%20Eighties">The Greatest Songs of the Eighties</a>". He awarded "Faryl" 3 out of a possible 5, the highest rating of the four. Retailers in the United Kingdom ordered more than 80,000 copies of the album in the week before release, which Simon Cable, writing for the "Daily Mail", noted was more copies than <a href="U2">U2</a>'s recent "<a href="No%20Line%20on%20the%20Horizon">No Line on the Horizon</a>". It also topped the <a href="Amazon.co.uk">Amazon.co.uk</a> presale chart. On the day of the release the album was at the number one spot on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a>, based on presales alone. The album became the fastest-selling classical solo album in British history, selling 20,000 copies in the first four days. The previous record holder had been <a href="Hayley%20Westenra">Hayley Westenra</a>'s "<a href="Pure%20%28Hayley%20Westenra%20album%29">Pure</a>". The first week resulted in sales of 29,200 copies, which is higher than any other debut album of a classical singer. "Faryl" officially entered the charts at number six and rose to fourth place the next week. The success of the album left Smith the third "Britain's Got Talent" contestant to achieve a top ten album, after Potts (with "<a href="One%20Chance%20%28album%29">One Chance</a>") and Johnston (with "One Voice").

In April 2009 Smith travelled to Los Angeles to begin her promotion of "Faryl" in the United States. She appeared on "<a href="The%20Ellen%20DeGeneres%20Show">The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a>" in early May as part of her promotional tour. "Faryl" was released in the US on 5 May. Smith said before the release that she did not expect it to sell as well as it did in the UK. She said that "in the US it's a lot harder because I'm not as well-known." Smith travelled back to the UK in early May, and, on 23 May, "Faryl" peaked at 31st place on <a href="Top%20Heatseekers">Top Heatseekers</a> Albums chart and at sixth place on the Classical Albums chart, remaining in the charts for one and 17 weeks respectively. Smith opened the 2009 <a href="Classical%20BRIT%20Awards">Classical BRIT Awards</a>, where, according to Elisa Roche of the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>", she "captivated the best names in classical music". She is the youngest performer ever to sing at the Classical BRITs. On 30 May, Smith became the youngest person to sing the United Kingdom <a href="national%20anthem">national anthem</a>, "<a href="God%20Save%20The%20Queen">God Save The Queen</a>", at an <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> final when she performed during the opening ceremony at the <a href="2009%20FA%20Cup%20Final">2009 final</a>, held in the <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a>. In June, Smith performed a duet with <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Carreras">José Carreras</a> at the <a href="Hampton%20Court%20Palace%20Festival">Hampton Court Palace Festival</a>, and in July, she attended the O2 Silver Clef Awards, winning the Classical Award.

In February 2010, after the release of Smith's second album, "Faryl" was nominated for a <a href="Classical%20BRIT%20Awards">Classical BRIT Award</a> in the album category. The category is voted for by the public, and the shortlist comprises the ten best-selling classical albums of the previous year. "Faryl" lost to <a href="Only%20Men%20Aloud">Only Men Aloud</a>'s "<a href="Band%20of%20Brothers%20%28Only%20Men%20Aloud%21%20album%29">Band of Brothers</a>". Smith also lost in the young British classical performer category to <a href="Jack%20Liebeck">Jack Liebeck</a>, a violinist. Smith became the youngest artist ever to receive a double nomination. In November, Smith was awarded the best classical award at the 2009 <a href="Variety%20Club">Variety Club</a> awards, the youngest ever recipient in the awards' 57-year history.

In July 2009 it was announced that Smith was hoping to release her second album later in the year. In an interview, she expressed surprise and pleasure that the label wanted her to do another album so soon after the first. In September, further details about the album were released, including its name, "Wonderland", and planned release date, 30 November. Smith claimed that "Faryl" "was an introduction to me and an introduction for me to recording", while Cohen, producer of both "Faryl" and "Wonderland", said Smith had "matured as an artist since the first album and I have no doubt that once again, people will be astonished and moved by her performances". The album, which was recorded at <a href="Sarm%20Studios">Sarm Studios</a> in <a href="Notting%20Hill">Notting Hill</a>, London, was completed in early October, and is loosely based on <a href="Lewis%20Carroll">Lewis Carroll</a>'s "<a href="Alice%20in%20Wonderland">Alice in Wonderland</a>". "Wonderland" was released on 30 November. To publicise the album, Smith appeared on numerous radio shows, as well as television appearances including "<a href="Ready%20Steady%20Cook">Ready Steady Cook</a>", "<a href="Blue%20Peter">Blue Peter</a>", the <a href="BBC%20News%20Channel">BBC News Channel</a>, "<a href="The%20Alan%20Titchmarsh%20Show">The Alan Titchmarsh Show</a>" and "<a href="Sky%20News%20Sunrise">Sky News Sunrise</a>".

"Wonderland" was well received by critics; Paul Callan, reviewing the album for the "Daily Express", described it as "a joy". He compared it to other Christmas albums, saying that "[t]oo many are tired, much-repeated carol selections." He described Smith's "control, tone and warmth" as "very moving". Andy Gill, reviewing "Wonderland" for "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>", gave a less positive review. He said that the influence of "Alice in Wonderland" was often hard to perceive and that Cohen and Smith had "sweetened the classical elements". However, he praised the arrangements of "Adiemus", "Barcarolle", "Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence" and "Blow The Wind Southerly", but noted that on tracks including "Close To You", "the lack of emotional weight is telling." Overall, Gill gave "Wonderland" 3 out of 5. However, the album failed to perform as well as "Faryl"; it entered the British album charts at number 56 for the week ending 12 December before dropping to number 92 the following week and then out of the top 100. After "Wonderland", Smith's contract with Universal ended, and she subsequently received less attention from the press. Smith described the break with the label as mainly her decision, as she needed to focus on her A levels, which would allow her to get to university, explaining in an interview that "It wasn't like it ended horribly."

Smith performed at the 2009 <a href="Royal%20Variety%20Performance">Royal Variety Performance</a> in front of <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a>, where she sang "God Save the Queen" with <a href="The%20Soldiers">The Soldiers</a>. She later said that the experience, including subsequently meeting the Queen, as the highlight of her year. Smith also performed elsewhere with The Soldiers, including at <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a> and <a href="Great%20Ormond%20Street%20Children%27s%20Hospital">Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital</a>.

In the aftermath of the <a href="2010%20Haiti%20earthquake">2010 Haiti earthquake</a>, Smith and 22 other classical musicians from the UK recorded a cover version of "<a href="The%20Prayer%20%28Celine%20Dion%20and%20Andrea%20Bocelli%20song%29">The Prayer</a>", which was released for download on 14 March. The proceeds of the single went to the <a href="Disasters%20Emergency%20Committee">Disasters Emergency Committee</a>. Smith said "It's a real honour to be a part of something that is being done for the first time, and I hope that all music lovers get involved and help raise money for the campaign. I really hope that we can make a difference together to help the horrible situation that Haiti is in at the moment." The group, dubbed "Classical <a href="Band%20Aid%20%28band%29">Band Aid</a>", recorded the track at <a href="Metropolis%20Studios">Metropolis Studios</a> and were backed by the <a href="Royal%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">Royal Philharmonic Orchestra</a>. Each vocalist in the group performed their own solo lines, and the entire group came together for the finale. "The Prayer" was the first ever classical charity single; Smith noted that "Pop singers do things like this a lot but it's unusual for classical singers to get involved so I've been really excited."

In the summer of 2010 Smith performed at various festivals and events. Her father stated that "because she is still so young, we don't want her doing complete shows on her own and we don't want her doing too much." Appearances included the Mercedes-Benz World Summer Concert in <a href="Weybridge">Weybridge</a> on 4 July, That Glorious Noise charity concert in aid of <a href="muscular%20dystrophy">muscular dystrophy</a> in <a href="Cleethorpes">Cleethorpes</a> on 17 July and the Last Night of the <a href="Hampstead%20Heath%23Kenwood">Kenwood</a> Proms on 21 August, as well as the wedding of <a href="Eamonn%20Holmes">Eamonn Holmes</a> and <a href="Ruth%20Langsford">Ruth Langsford</a>. Smith also opened the Serenata festival. Angela Young, reviewing the festival for the "<a href="Bournemouth%20Daily%20Echo">Bournemouth Daily Echo</a>", said "Faryl Smith was my personal highlight of the Thursday night line-up, her bizarrely powerful voice (considering her diminutive size and age) taking my breath away and it contrasted so well with her naivete as she said 'at least it's not raining' – just as the heavens opened."

In October Smith performed for the first time in Ireland, at the <a href="National%20Concert%20Hall">National Concert Hall</a>, Dublin. She continued to perform publicly throughout 2011. In May, she performed at a <a href="Help%20for%20Heroes">Help for Heroes</a> charity concert, which raised £2,000, and in both June and October, she performed at concerts to celebrate the 90th year of the <a href="Royal%20British%20Legion">Royal British Legion</a>. She again appeared at the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod in July, where she sang with <a href="Russell%20Watson">Russell Watson</a>. Smith's father described the appearance as "like a homecoming", due to her previous appearance at the competition. In further charitable events later in the year, she raised £2,700 for a hospice in <a href="Cransley">Cransley</a>, and performed in aid of the <a href="Salvation%20Army">Salvation Army</a> in <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a>. During the Christmas period, Smith performed for the <a href="Great%20Ormond%20Street%20Hospital%20Children%27s%20Charity">Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity</a> in their annual Christmas carol concert, and at the North Wales Choral Festival at <a href="Llandudno">Llandudno</a>. She also appeared as a guest on <a href="Rhydian%20Roberts">Rhydian Roberts</a>'s talent show on <a href="S4C">S4C</a> in December. In 2012, she performed with the <a href="Mousehole%20Male%20Voice%20Choir">Mousehole Male Voice Choir</a> in <a href="Penzance">Penzance</a>, and in 2013, she continued to perform locally in Kettering.

From 2012–3, Smith performed several times with the <a href="International%20Harp%20Ensemble">International Harp Ensemble</a>, a Surrey-based group of harpists who produce a variety of different styles of harp music, including appearing with the group on a September episode of "<a href="Songs%20of%20Praise">Songs of Praise</a>". She also guest-featured on the group's 2012 album "<a href="The%20Magic%20of%20a%20Thousand%20Strings">The Magic of a Thousand Strings</a>", singing on five tracks. Further shows with the International Harp Ensemble were planned into 2014. While working with the International Harp Ensemble, Smith began training with vocal coach <a href="Joy%20Mammen">Joy Mammen</a>, who also teaches <a href="Lesley%20Garrett">Lesley Garrett</a>, as well as learning German and Italian, with the intention of moving from <a href="classical%20crossover">classical crossover</a> towards opera. She continued to perform publicly in 2015, singing at Wembley again in August.

Smith was born in <a href="Kettering%2C%20Northamptonshire">Kettering, Northamptonshire</a>, England, on 23 July 1995. She originally attended Henry Gotch Primary School in Kettering and then became a student at <a href="Southfield%20School%2C%20Kettering">Southfield School for Girls</a>, although she received private tutoring while working. She completed her <a href="GCSE">GCSE</a>s in 2011, and she studied for her <a href="A%20levels">A levels</a>, with the intention of going to university afterwards. In 2015, aged 20, she started to study music at the <a href="Guildhall%20School%20of%20Music%20and%20Drama">Guildhall School of Music and Drama</a> in London.

While at school, Smith enjoyed playing football; she played for the Kettering Generals Under-11s girls' team when they reached the <a href="Weetabix">Weetabix</a> League cup final, as well as for the club's Under-13 girls. She attended a theatre club, played the guitar and piano and sang in two choirs, including the Masquerade Youth Choir. Smith's father, Tony, is a health and safety inspector, and for a time worked full-time overseeing Smith's activities. Her mother, Linda, is a hairdresser, and she has an older brother, Shea.

Andrew Johnston (singer)

Andrew Johnston (born 23 September 1994) is a British singer who rose to fame when he appeared as a <a href="boy%20soprano">boy soprano</a> on the second series of the UK television talent show "<a href="Britain%27s%20Got%20Talent">Britain's Got Talent</a>" in 2008. Although he did not win the competition, he received a contract to record with <a href="Syco%20Music">Syco Music</a>, a label owned by the "Britain's Got Talent" judge <a href="Simon%20Cowell">Simon Cowell</a>. Johnston's debut album, "<a href="One%20Voice%20%28Andrew%20Johnston%20album%29">One Voice</a>", was released in September of the same year, and reached number four on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a>. Although Johnston originally performed as a treble, his voice has since matured to <a href="baritone">baritone</a>, and he is now a member of the <a href="National%20Youth%20Choir">National Youth Choir</a>.

Johnston was born in Dumfries, Scotland, and his parents separated when he was an infant. He and his mother moved to Carlisle, where they lived in "poverty". He became head chorister at Carlisle Cathedral, and was <a href="bullying">bullied</a> at school because of his love of classical music. While some journalists have argued "Britain's Got Talent" producers took advantage of Johnston's background, others have hailed his story as inspirational. In 2009, he graduated from <a href="Trinity%20School%20%28Carlisle%29">Trinity School</a>. Johnston now studies full-time at the <a href="Royal%20Northern%20College%20of%20Music">Royal Northern College of Music</a>.

Johnston was born on 23 September 1994 in <a href="Dumfries">Dumfries</a>, Scotland, the son of Andrew Johnston and Morag Brannock. He was given the extensive name Andrew Aaron Lewis Patrick Brannock John Grieve Michael Robert Oscar Schmidt Johnston. Johnston's parents separated when he was eight months old, and from that time he lived with his mother and three older siblings in <a href="Carlisle%2C%20Cumbria">Carlisle, Cumbria</a>, in the north of England, where he attended <a href="Trinity%20School%20%28Carlisle%29">Trinity School</a>. Johnston tried out for <a href="Carlisle%20Cathedral%23Carlisle%20Cathedral%20Choir">Carlisle Cathedral Choir</a> at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school. He was auditioned by the choirmaster <a href="Jeremy%20Suter">Jeremy Suter</a> and accepted into the choir at the age of seven. Johnston's mother, who had no previous association with the cathedral, described her feelings of being overwhelmed by emotion at having her boy singing in such a "stunning building among those extraordinary voices". His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that "it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from <a href="bullying">bullies</a> which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral. By the time of his participation in "Britain's Got Talent", Johnston was head chorister.

In September 2008, after his appearance on "Britain's Got Talent" but before the release of his first album, Johnston embarked on a tour of Norway with the choir, performing at <a href="Stavanger%20Cathedral">Stavanger Cathedral</a> and <a href="Utstein%20Abbey">Utstein Abbey</a>, among other places. The tour was conceived because the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Stavanger">Diocese of Stavanger</a> is connected with the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Carlisle">Diocese of Carlisle</a> through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with the choir. Johnston features as head chorister on one of the choir's albums, "The Choral Music of F.W Wadely", released in November 2008.

Johnston was entered as a competitor in the <a href="Britain%27s%20Got%20Talent%20%28series%202%29">second series</a> of "<a href="Britain%27s%20Got%20Talent">Britain's Got Talent</a>" by his mother. He passed the first public audition, singing "<a href="Pie%20Jesu">Pie Jesu</a>" from <a href="Andrew%20Lloyd%20Webber">Andrew Lloyd Webber</a>'s "<a href="Requiem%20%28Lloyd%20Webber%29">Requiem</a>". <a href="Amanda%20Holden">Amanda Holden</a>, one of the competition's judges, was brought to tears, and the audience offered Johnston a <a href="standing%20ovation">standing ovation</a>. Johnston was tipped as the favourite to win the competition. Later, Johnston described his initial audition as daunting, saying that "it was scary singing in front of 2,500 people. I had never sang on stage before – then there was also Simon, Amanda and <a href="Piers%20Morgan">Piers</a>". He won his semi-final heat on 27 May 2008, receiving the most public votes on the night and thereby qualifying for the final. He sang "<a href="Tears%20in%20Heaven">Tears in Heaven</a>" by <a href="Eric%20Clapton">Eric Clapton</a>; judge Holden told him he had "a gift from God in [his] voice". At the final on 30 May, he again sang "Pie Jesu". He finished in third place, behind the winner, the <a href="street%20dance">street dance</a>r <a href="George%20Sampson">George Sampson</a> and runners-up, the dance group <a href="Signature%20%28dance%20group%29">Signature</a>. Johnston left the stage in tears, later saying that he "was upset. But when you see the talent that was there, it was an honour just to be in the final". The day after the final, Cowell's publicist <a href="Max%20Clifford">Max Clifford</a> said that it was "quite possible" that Cowell would be offering record contracts to some of the finalists, including Johnston. Johnston and other contestants then embarked on a national arena tour.

During his initial audition, Johnston claimed that he was bullied and victimised from the age of six because of his singing. When asked how he dealt with the issue, he stated "I carry on singing." There were claims in the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>", a UK-based tabloid newspaper, that the programme's producers had deliberately overstated the extent of Johnston's bullying as a "sob story", suggesting that sympathy rather than his singing got him many of the votes. However, in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", Johnston's success story was described as "the stuff of fairytales", as he was successful despite having been raised in "poverty". Johnston said he did not talk about being bullied because he was told to do so by producers, but "because I believed it would help people who were going through what I had gone through be stronger". Johnston has subsequently visited schools and elsewhere to help other victims of bullying. He said "I want to use my experience of bullies to help other kids".

On 12 June 2008, while Johnston was travelling with the "Britain's Got Talent" Live Tour, it was announced that Johnston had signed a record deal with <a href="Syco%20Music">Syco Music</a>, a division of <a href="Sony%20BMG">Sony BMG</a>, and that his first album would be produced after the tour. The deal was reportedly for £1 million. After signing with Syco, Johnston made public appearances, including performing at <a href="Andrew%20Lloyd%20Webber">Andrew Lloyd Webber</a>'s birthday celebrations on 14 September, and at <a href="Carlisle%20United">Carlisle United</a>'s <a href="Brunton%20Park">Brunton Park</a>.

Johnston's debut album, "<a href="One%20Voice%20%28Andrew%20Johnston%20album%29">One Voice</a>", was released on 29 September 2008. It includes a cover of "<a href="Walking%20in%20the%20Air">Walking in the Air</a>", performed with <a href="Faryl%20Smith">Faryl Smith</a>. The album was recorded over a six-week period in London, and the track listing was chosen by Cowell. Johnston described the recording process as "brilliant", and that it was "really good – just to be in a recording studio and meet the different people". The album debuted in the British charts at number five, and finished the week at number four. The album was later certified gold, having sold 100,000 copies, and Johnston was presented a gold disc by daytime television presenter <a href="Penny%20Smith">Penny Smith</a>. Critics responded positively to the album, with Kate Leaver, writing for the "<a href="Korea%20JoongAng%20Daily">Korea JoongAng Daily</a>", saying Johnston "has truer talent than hordes of his musical elders" and that "the vulnerability" of Johnston's performance on the album "makes for a haunting musical experience". In "<a href="Music%20Week">Music Week</a>", the album was described as "highly-anticipated", and Johnston was called "exceptionally-talented".

After the album's release, Johnston became involved in the <a href="Sing%20Up">Sing Up</a> campaign, appearing in schools around the country to encourage other young people to join choirs. In December 2008, Johnston made a guest appearance at <a href="Whitehaven">Whitehaven</a>'s Christmas fair, and performed at a carol service in <a href="Bradford">Bradford</a>. Johnston was also invited to turn on the Carlisle <a href="Christmas%20lights%20%28holiday%20decoration%29">Christmas lights</a> and perform at the celebrations. Mike Mitchelson, of Carlisle City Council, described Johnston as "one of our local heroes".

In September 2009, Johnston announced that he would be taking a year off from singing as his voice had broken, changing him to a <a href="tenor">tenor</a>. He had previously performed as a <a href="Boy%20soprano">treble</a>. He said "the tutors at [the Royal Northern College of Music] said they'll be able to train my voice up again. It's the same as it ever was, just deeper". Johnston's voice then changed from a tenor to a <a href="baritone">baritone</a>. After remaining out of the spotlight for two years, he joined the <a href="National%20Youth%20Choir">National Youth Choir</a>, saying "I'm just another lad in there – no one focuses on "Britain's Got Talent" and I'm happy about that". In 2011, he was awarded a <a href="Royal%20School%20of%20Church%20Music">Royal School of Church Music</a> Gold medal; public performances that year included a charitable concert, alongside organists John Bromley and Tony Green, at <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Church%2C%20Helsby">St Paul's Church, Helsby</a> in November.

In September 2013, Johnston began to study for a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Music">Bachelor of Music</a> degree at the <a href="Royal%20Northern%20College%20of%20Music">Royal Northern College of Music</a>, under the tutelage of Jeff Lawton, who had previously tutored him at the Junior College. He immediately joined the college's Chamber Choir and the <a href="Manchester%20Cathedral">Manchester Cathedral</a> choir, but said that he intended to still sing with the Carlisle Cathedral choir where possible. While a student, Johnston's singing was adversely affected by a broken nose, the result of an unprovoked attack in a Carlisle nightclub on <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Day">New Year's Day</a>, 2014.

Johnston's family home is in <a href="Stanwix">Stanwix</a>, Carlisle. His mother, Morag Brannock, worked for the <a href="Office%20for%20National%20Statistics">Office for National Statistics</a> before giving up her job to support her son's career. Prior to his "Britain's Got Talent" appearances, he attended Trinity School, and later received tuition from a personal tutor. Johnston said that he "had a lot of support from local people when ... taking part in "Britain's Got Talent"", and was given a civic award for outstanding achievement by <a href="City%20of%20Carlisle">Carlisle City Council</a> in March 2009.

Johnston's interests include <a href="jujitsu">jujitsu</a>, in which he has a <a href="Black%20belt%20%28martial%20arts%29">black belt</a>.

Saint-Sylvestre coup d'état

The Saint-Sylvestre coup d'état was a <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a> staged by <a href="Jean-B%C3%A9del%20Bokassa">Jean-Bédel Bokassa</a>, leader of the <a href="Central%20African%20Republic">Central African Republic</a> (CAR) army, and his military officers against the government of President <a href="David%20Dacko">David Dacko</a> on 31 December 1965 and 1 January 1966. Dacko, Bokassa's cousin, took over the country in 1960, and Bokassa, a military officer in the French army, joined the CAR army in 1962. By 1965, the country was in turmoil—plagued by corruption and slow economic growth, while its borders were breached by rebels from neighboring countries. Dacko obtained financial aid from the <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">People's Republic of China</a>, but despite this support, the country's problems persisted. Bokassa made plans to take over the government; Dacko was made aware of this, and attempted to counter by forming the <a href="gendarmerie">gendarmerie</a> headed by <a href="Jean%20Izamo">Jean Izamo</a>, who quickly became Dacko's closest adviser.

With the aid of Captain <a href="Alexandre%20Banza">Alexandre Banza</a>, Bokassa started the coup <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Eve">New Year's Eve</a> night in 1965. First, Bokassa and his men captured <a href="Jean%20Izamo">Jean Izamo</a>, locking him in a cellar at Camp de Roux. Bokassa's men then occupied the capital, <a href="Bangui">Bangui</a>, and overpowered the gendarmerie and other resistance. After midnight, Dacko headed back to the capital, where he was promptly arrested, forced to resign from office and then imprisoned at Camp Kassaï. According to official reports, eight people were killed for resisting the coup. By the end of January 1966, Izamo was tortured to death, but Dacko's life was spared because of a request from the French government, which Bokassa was trying to satisfy. Bokassa justified the coup by claiming he had to save the country from falling under the influence of communism, and cut off diplomatic relations with China. In the early days of his government, Bokassa dissolved the National Assembly, abolished the Constitution and issued a number of decrees, banning <a href="begging">begging</a>, <a href="female%20genital%20cutting">female circumcision</a>, and <a href="polygamy">polygamy</a>, among other things. Bokassa initially struggled to obtain international recognition for the new government. However, after a successful meeting with the president of <a href="Chad">Chad</a>, Bokassa obtained recognition of the regime from other African nations, and eventually from France, the former colonial power.

Bokassa's right-hand man Banza attempted his own coup in April 1969, but one of his co-conspirators informed the president of the plan. Banza was put in front of a <a href="military%20tribunal">military tribunal</a> and sentenced to <a href="execution%20by%20firing%20squad">death by firing squad</a>. Dacko, who remained in isolation at Camp de Roux, sent a letter to the Chinese ambassador in <a href="Brazzaville">Brazzaville</a> in June 1969, which Bokassa intercepted. Bokassa charged Dacko with threatening state security and transferred him to the infamous Ngaragba Prison, where many prisoners taken captive during the coup were still being held. A local judge convinced Bokassa that there was a lack of evidence to convict Dacko, who was instead placed under house arrest. In September 1976, Dacko was named personal adviser to the president; the French government later convinced him to take part in a coup to overthrow Bokassa, who was under heavy criticism for his ruthless <a href="dictatorship">dictatorial</a> rule. This coup was carried out on 20 and 21 September 1979, when Dacko became president again, only to be overthrown in another coup two years later.

In 1958, after the <a href="French%20Fourth%20Republic">French Fourth Republic</a> began to consider granting independence to most of its African colonies, nationalist leader <a href="Barth%C3%A9lemy%20Boganda">Barthélemy Boganda</a> met with <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20France">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Charles%20de%20Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a> to discuss terms for the independence of Oubangui-Chari, a French colonial territory which later became the Central African Republic (CAR). De Gaulle accepted his request, and on 1 December 1958, Boganda declared the establishment of the autonomous CAR, with full independence to follow soon. He became the <a href="territorial%20autonomy">autonomous territory</a>'s first Prime Minister and intended to serve as the first <a href="List%20of%20heads%20of%20state%20of%20the%20Central%20African%20Republic%20and%20Central%20African%20Empire">President of the independent CAR</a>. However, he was killed in a plane crash on 29 March 1959, while en route to the capital, Bangui.

Boganda's right-hand man <a href="Abel%20Goumba">Abel Goumba</a>, described as "intelligent, honest, and strongly nationalistic" by author Brian Titley in "Dark Age: The Political Odyssey of Emperor Bokassa", succeeded him as the leader of the CAR. In May 1959, a month into Goumba's term, <a href="David%20Dacko">David Dacko</a> took control of the government. Dacko, a former member of Boganda's cabinet and party leader of the <a href="MESAN">Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa</a> (MESAN), had the support of the French high commissioner Roger Barberot, the Bangui chamber of commerce and Boganda's widow Michelle Jourdain. Two months later, Dacko dismissed Goumba from his new post as minister of finance. Goumba and <a href="Pierre%20Maleombho">Pierre Maleombho</a>, the former president of the <a href="National%20Assembly%20of%20the%20Central%20African%20Republic">National Assembly</a> who was ousted by Dacko, left the MESAN party and organized their own opposition party, <a href="Democratic%20Evolution%20Movement%20of%20Central%20Africa">Democratic Evolution Movement of Central Africa</a> (MEDAC), on 25 June 1960. Meanwhile, on August 13, 1960, Boganda's dream was realized when the Central African Republic (CAR) attained formal independence from France.

MEDAC became moderately popular, was approved by Etienne Ngounio (the Dacko-appointed president of MESAN), and received significant support in <a href="by-election">by-election</a>s on 20 September. Dacko viewed MEDAC as a dissident party and sought to disestablish it—he soon received power from the National Assembly to deal with his opponents in any way he saw fit. In December 1960, Dacko dissolved MEDAC and Goumba was arrested for "fomenting disorder by questioning Dacko's assumption of power". Goumba was eventually sentenced to life in prison, but fled into exile in France.

On 1 January 1962, Dacko's cousin, <a href="Jean-B%C3%A9del%20Bokassa">Jean-Bédel Bokassa</a>, left the <a href="French%20Army">French Army</a> and joined the <a href="Military%20of%20the%20Central%20African%20Republic">military forces of the CAR</a> with the rank of battalion commandant. Over a year later, Bokassa became <a href="commander-in-chief">commander-in-chief</a> of the 500 soldiers in the Central African army. Due to his relation to Dacko and experience abroad in the French military, Bokassa was able to quickly rise through the ranks of the army, becoming the Central African army's first colonel on 1 December 1964.

Bokassa sought recognition for his status as the army's leader; he frequently appeared in public wearing all his military decorations, and in ceremonies often tried to sit next to President Dacko to hint at his importance in the government. Bokassa constantly involved himself in heated arguments with Jean-Paul Douate, the government's chief of protocol, who admonished him for not following the correct order of seating at presidential tables. At first, Dacko found his cousin's antics for power and recognition amusing. Despite the recent rash of African military coups, Dacko publicly dismissed the possibility that Bokassa would someday try to take control of the country. At a state dinner, he said, "Colonel Bokassa only wants to collect medals and he is too stupid to pull off a coup d'état". Other members of Dacko's cabinet saw Bokassa as a major threat to the regime. Jean-Arthur Bandio, the minister of interior, recommended that Bokassa be brought into the cabinet, which he hoped would both satisfy the colonel's desire for recognition and break his connections with the army. To prevent the possibility of a military coup, Dacko created the <a href="gendarmerie">gendarmerie</a>, an armed police force of 500, headed by <a href="Jean%20Izamo">Jean Izamo</a>, and a 120-member presidential security guard, led by Prosper Mounoumbaye.

Dacko's government faced a number of problems during 1964 and 1965: the economy experienced <a href="economic%20stagnation">stagnation</a>, the bureaucracy started to fall apart, and the country's boundaries were constantly breached by <a href="Patrice%20Lumumba">Lumumbists</a> from the south and the rebel <a href="Sudan%20People%27s%20Liberation%20Army">Sudan People's Liberation Army</a> from the east. Under pressure from radicals in MESAN and in an attempt to cultivate alternative sources of support and display his independence in foreign policy, Dacko established diplomatic relations with the <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">People's Republic of China</a> (PRC) in September 1964. A delegation led by Meng Yieng and agents of the Chinese government toured the country, showing Communist propaganda films. Soon after, the PRC gave the CAR an interest-free loan of one billion <a href="CFA%20franc">CFA franc</a>s (20 million <a href="French%20franc">French franc</a>s); however, the aid failed to prevent the prospect of a financial collapse for the country. Another problem which plagued the government was widespread corruption. Bokassa felt that he needed to take over the CAR government to remove the influence of Communism and solve all the country's problems. According to Samuel Decalo, a scholar on African government, Bokassa's personal ambitions most likely played the most important role in his decision to launch a coup against the government.

Dacko sent Bokassa to <a href="Paris">Paris</a> as part of a delegation for the <a href="Bastille%20Day">Bastille Day</a> celebrations in July 1965. After attending a 23 July ceremony to mark the closing of a military officer training school he had attended decades earlier, Bokassa planned to return to the CAR. However, Dacko had forbidden his return, and Bokassa spent the next few months trying to obtain the support of friends in the French and Central African armed forces. Dacko eventually yielded to pressure and allowed Bokassa back in October.

Tensions between Dacko and Bokassa increased. In December, Dacko approved a budget increase for Izamo's gendarmerie, but rejected the budget proposal for Bokassa's army. At this point, Bokassa told friends he was annoyed by Dacko's treatment and was "going for a coup d'état". Dacko planned to replace Bokassa with Izamo as his personal military adviser, and wanted to promote army officers loyal to the government, while demoting Bokassa and his close associates. Dacko was not silent about his plans; he hinted at his intentions to elders of the <a href="Bobangui">Bobangui</a> village, who informed Bokassa of the plan in turn. Bokassa realized he had to act against Dacko quickly, and worried that his 500-man army would be no match for the gendarmerie and the presidential guard. He was also concerned the French would intervene to aid Dacko, as had occurred after the 23 February 1964 coup d'état in <a href="Gabon">Gabon</a> against President <a href="L%C3%A9on%20M%27ba">Léon M'ba</a>. After receiving word of the coup from the country's vice president, officials in Paris sent paratroopers to Gabon in a matter of hours and M'ba was quickly restored to power.

Bokassa found substantive support from his co-conspirator, Captain <a href="Alexandre%20Banza">Alexandre Banza</a>, who was commander of the <a href="Camp%20Kassa%C3%AF%20military%20base">Camp Kassaï military base</a> in northeast Bangui, and, like Bokassa, had served in the French army in posts around the world. Banza was an intelligent, ambitious and capable man who played a major role in planning the coup. By December, many people began to anticipate the potential turmoil that would result. Dacko's personal advisers alerted him that Bokassa "showed signs of mental instability" and needed to be arrested before he sought to bring down the government, but Dacko failed to heed these warnings.

Early in the evening of 31 December 1965, Dacko left the Palais de la Renaissance to visit one of his ministers' plantations southwest of the capital. At 22:30 <a href="West%20Africa%20Time">WAT</a> (<a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a> 21:30), Captain Banza gave orders to his officers to begin the coup: one of his captains was to subdue the security guard in the presidential palace, while the other was to take control of Radio-Bangui to prevent communication between Dacko and his followers. Bokassa called Izamo at his headquarters, asking him to come to Camp de Roux to sign some papers that needed his immediate attention. Izamo, who was at a <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Eve">New Year's Eve</a> celebration with friends, reluctantly agreed and traveled in his wife's car to the camp. Upon arrival, he was confronted by Banza and Bokassa, who informed him of the coup in progress. When asked if he would support the coup, Izamo said no, leading Bokassa and Banza to overpower him and hold him in a <a href="basement">cellar</a>.

Shortly after midnight, in the first minutes of 1 January 1966, Bokassa and Banza organized their troops and told them of their plan to take over the government. Bokassa claimed that Dacko had <a href="resignation">resigned from the presidency</a> and given the position to his close advisor Izamo, then told the soldiers that the gendarmerie would take over the CAR army, which had to act now to keep its position. He then asked the soldiers if they would support his course of action; the men who refused were locked up. At 00:30 WAT, Bokassa and his supporters left Camp de Roux to take over the capital. They encountered little resistance and were able to take Bangui. Bokassa and Banza then rushed to the Palais de la Renaissance, where they tried to arrest Dacko, who was nowhere to be found. Bokassa began to panic, as he believed the president had been warned of the coup in advance, and immediately ordered his soldiers to search for Dacko in the countryside until he was found.

Dacko was not aware of the events taking place in the capital. After leaving his minister's plantation near midnight, he headed to Simon Samba's house to ask the <a href="Aka%20%28Pygmy%20tribe%29">Aka Pygmy</a> leader to conduct a year-end ritual. After an hour at Samba's house, he was informed of the coup in Bangui. According to Titley, Dacko then left for the capital, in hopes of stopping the coup with the help of loyal members of the gendarmerie and French paratroopers. Others like Thomas E. O'Toole, professor of <a href="sociology">sociology</a> and <a href="anthropology">anthropology</a> at <a href="St.%20Cloud%20State%20University">St. Cloud State University</a>, believe that Dacko was not trying to mount a resistance—instead, he was planning on resigning and handing his power over to Izamo. In any case, Dacko was arrested by soldiers patrolling Pétévo Junction, on the western border of the capital. He was taken back to the presidential palace, where Bokassa hugged the president and told him, "I tried to warn you—but now it's too late". President Dacko was taken to Ngaragba Prison in east Bangui at around 02:00 WAT. In a move that he thought would boost his popularity in the country, Bokassa ordered prison director Otto Sacher to release all prisoners in the jail. Bokassa then took Dacko to Camp Kassaï at 03:20 WAT, where the president was forced to resign from office. Later, Bokassa's officers announced on Radio-Bangui that the Dacko government had been toppled and Bokassa had taken over control. In the morning, Bokassa addressed the public via Radio-Bangui:

Officially, eight people died trying to resist the coup. Afterwards, Bokassa's officers went around the country, arresting Dacko's political allies and close friends, including Simon Samba, Jean-Paul Douate and more than 60 presidential security guards, who were all taken to Ngaragba Prison. Prosper Mounoumbaye, the director of the presidential security, fled the country. Weeks later, he was detained by the <a href="Kongo%20people">Congolese</a> and handed over to Bokassa on 23 January 1966. At Camp Kassaï, he was beaten and tortured to death, in full view of Bokassa, Banza and Dacko. Jean Izamo met a similar fate: he was transferred to Ngaragba Prison on 10 January, but was tortured to death by the month's end. President Dacko's life was spared, as Bokassa wanted international recognition for his government and France had threatened to cut off aid to the CAR if Dacko was killed. Bokassa had Dacko detained in a small room at Camp Kassaï, where he was cut off from communication with the outside world and placed on a highly restrictive diet. On 3 February, he was taken to Camp de Roux, where he remained in isolation.

In the meantime, Bokassa engaged in <a href="self-promotion">self-promotion</a> before the media, showing his countrymen his French army medals, and displaying his strength, fearlessness and masculinity. He formed a new government called the Revolutionary Council, invalidated the constitution and dissolved the National Assembly, calling it "a lifeless organ no longer representing the people". In his address to the nation, Bokassa claimed that the government would hold elections in the future, a new assembly would be formed, and a new constitution would be written. He also told his countrymen that he would give up his power after the communist threat had been eliminated, the economy stabilized, and corruption rooted out. President Bokassa allowed MESAN to continue functioning, but barred all other political organizations from the country. In the coming months, Bokassa imposed a number of new rules and regulations: men and women between the ages of 18 to 55 had to provide proof that they had jobs, or else they would be fined or imprisoned; <a href="begging">begging</a> was banned; <a href="Tom-tom%20drum">tom-tom</a> playing was allowed during the nights and weekends; and a "morality brigade" was formed in the capital to monitor bars and dance halls. <a href="Polygamy">Polygamy</a>, <a href="dowry">dowries</a> and <a href="female%20genital%20cutting">female circumcision</a> were all abolished. Bokassa also opened a <a href="public%20transport">public transport</a> system in Bangui and subsidized the creation of two national <a href="orchestra">orchestra</a>s.

Despite the positive changes in the country, Bokassa had difficulty obtaining international recognition for his new government. He tried to justify the coup by explaining that Izamo and communist Chinese agents were trying to take over the government and that he had to intervene to save the CAR from the influence of communism. He alleged that Chinese agents in the countryside had been training and arming locals to start a revolution, and on 6 January 1966, he dismissed the communist agents from the country and cut off diplomatic relations with China. Bokassa also believed that the coup was necessary in order to prevent further corruption in the government.

Bokassa first secured diplomatic recognition from President <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Tombalbaye">François Tombalbaye</a> of neighboring <a href="Chad">Chad</a>, whom he met in <a href="Bouca">Bouca</a>, <a href="Ouham">Ouham</a>. After Bokassa reciprocated by meeting Tombalbaye on 2 April 1966 along the southern border of Chad at <a href="Sarh">Fort Archambault</a>, the two decided to help one another if either was in danger of losing power. Soon after, other African countries began to diplomatically recognize the new government. At first, the French government was reluctant to support the Bokassa regime, so Banza went to Paris to meet with French officials to convince them that the coup was necessary to save the country from turmoil. Bokassa met with Prime Minister <a href="Georges%20Pompidou">Georges Pompidou</a> on 7 July 1966, but the French remained noncommittal in offering their support. After Bokassa threatened to withdraw from the franc monetary zone, President Charles de Gaulle decided to make an official visit to the CAR on 17 November 1966. To the Bokassa regime, this visit meant that the French had finally accepted the new changes in the country.

Alexandre Banza, who stood by Bokassa throughout the planning and execution of the coup, served as <a href="minister%20of%20finance">minister of finance</a> and <a href="minister%20of%20state">minister of state</a> in the new government. Banza was successful in his efforts at building the government's reputation abroad; many believed that the natural-born leader would no longer accept serving as Bokassa's right-hand man. In 1967, Banza and Bokassa had a major argument regarding the country's budget, as Banza adamantly opposed Bokassa's extravagance at government events. Bokassa moved to Camp de Roux, where he felt he could safely run the government without having to worry about Banza's thirst for power. On 13 April 1968, Bokassa demoted Banza from minister of finance to minister of health, but let him remain in his position as minister of state. The following year, Banza made a number of remarks highly critical of Bokassa and his management of the economy. At this point, Bokassa realized that his minister would soon attempt to take over power in the country, so he removed him as his minister of state.

Banza revealed his intention to start a coup to Lieutenant Jean-Claude Mandaba, the commanding officer of Camp Kassaï, who promptly informed Bokassa. When he entered Camp Kassaï on 9 April 1969 (the coup was planned for that evening), Banza was ambushed, thrown into the trunk of a <a href="Mercedes-Benz">Mercedes</a> and taken directly to Bokassa by Mandaba and his soldiers. At his house in <a href="Berengo">Berengo</a>, Bokassa nearly beat Banza to death before Mandaba suggested that Banza be put on trial for appearance's sake. On 12 April, Banza presented his case before a <a href="military%20tribunal">military tribunal</a> at Camp de Roux, where he admitted to his plan, but stated that he had not planned to kill Bokassa. Nevertheless, he was <a href="capital%20punishment">sentenced to death</a> by <a href="execution%20by%20firing%20squad">firing squad</a>, taken to an open field behind Camp Kassaï, executed and buried in an <a href="unmarked%20grave">unmarked grave</a>.

Ex-President Dacko remained in isolation at Camp de Roux, where the French government, which expressed concern for his well-being, sent a <a href="military%20attach%C3%A9">military attaché</a> to visit him. Dacko told the attaché that he had not been given anything to read for more than two years; the attaché negotiated with the prison head to get Dacko some books. However, Dacko's living conditions failed to improve, and in June 1969, Dacko sent a letter to the Chinese ambassador in <a href="Brazzaville">Brazzaville</a>, asking that he offer financial support to his family. The message was intercepted and handed over to Bokassa, who thought the letter was ample reason for him to get rid of Dacko. Dacko was charged with threatening state security and transferred to Ngaragba Prison. However, Bokassa dropped the charges on 14 July, after Judge Albert Kouda convinced him that there was insufficient evidence to get a conviction. Dacko stayed at the Palais de la Renaissance until his health improved, after which he was sent to live in Mokinda, <a href="Lobaye">Lobaye</a> under <a href="house%20arrest">house arrest</a>. It was not until October 1969—almost four years after the coup—that Bokassa began releasing other prisoners from Ngaragba.

Dacko remained under house arrest until he was named private adviser to President Bokassa on 17 September 1976. Bokassa dissolved the government and formed the <a href="Central%20African%20Empire">Central African Empire</a>, which led to increasing international criticism in the late 1970s. Dacko managed to leave for Paris, where the French convinced him to cooperate in a coup to remove Bokassa from power and restore him to the presidency. Dacko was installed as president on 21 September 1979, but was once again removed from power by his army chief of staff, <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Kolingba">André Kolingba</a>, in a bloodless coup d'état on 1 September 1981. Bokassa lived in exile in <a href="Paris">Paris</a> and was <a href="Trial%20in%20absentia">sentenced to death "in absentia"</a> in December 1980. Upon returning to the CAR in October 1986, he was arrested and charged with <a href="treason">treason</a>, <a href="murder">murder</a>, <a href="cannibalism">cannibalism</a> and <a href="embezzlement">embezzlement</a>. He was cleared on the cannibalism charges, but was convicted on the rest and sentenced to death on 12 June 1987. Kolingba commuted his sentence to <a href="life%20imprisonment">life imprisonment</a> in February 1988, and then commuted it again to 20 years in prison. Kolingba later declared <a href="amnesty">amnesty</a> for all prisoners, so Bokassa was released from prison on 1 August 1993.

Anti-tobacco movement in Nazi Germany

In the early 20th century, German researchers made advances in <a href="Health%20effects%20of%20tobacco%23History">linking smoking to health harms</a>, which strengthened the <a href="anti-tobacco%20movement">anti-tobacco movement</a> in the Weimar Republic and led to a state-supported anti-smoking campaign. <a href="History%20of%20nicotine%20marketing%23Anti-tobacco%20movements">Early anti-tobacco movements</a> grew in many nations from the middle of the 19th century. The 1933–1945 anti-tobacco campaigns in Nazi Germany have been widely publicized, although stronger laws than those passed in Germany were passed in some American states, the UK, and elsewhere between 1890 and 1930. After 1941, anti-tobacco campaigns were restricted by the Nazi government.

The German movement was the most powerful anti-smoking movement in the world during the 1930s and early 1940s. However, tobacco control policy was incoherent and ineffective, with uncoordinated and often regional efforts by many actors. Obvious measures were not taken, and existing measures were not enforced. Some Nazi leaders condemned smoking and several of them openly criticized tobacco consumption, but others publicly smoked and denied that it was harmful. There was much research on smoking and its effects on health during Nazi rule, and it was the most important of its type at that time; but a directly-supported tobacco research institute produced work of only marginal scientific importance. <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>'s personal distaste for tobacco and the Nazi reproductive policies were among the motivating factors behind the Nazi campaigns against smoking.

The Nazi anti-tobacco campaign included banning smoking in trams, buses, and city trains, promoting health education, limiting cigarette rations in the <a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a>, organizing medical lectures for soldiers, and raising the tobacco tax. The Nazis also imposed restrictions on tobacco advertising and smoking in public spaces, and regulated restaurants and coffeehouses. These measures were widely circumvented or ignored.

The movement did not reduce the number of smokers. Tobacco use increased rapidly in the early years of the Nazi regime, between 1933 and 1939. The <a href="smoking%20rate">number of smokers</a> increased from 1939 to 1945, but cigarette consumption declined; rationing towards the end of the war and post-war poverty meant that the increasing numbers of smokers could not buy as many cigarettes. Even by the end of the 20th century, the anti-smoking movement in Germany had not attained the influence of the Nazi anti-smoking campaign. Germany has some of the weakest tobacco control measures in Europe, and German tobacco research has been described as "muted".

Anti-smoking measures have a long history in German-speaking areas. For instance, in 1840, the <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>n government re-instated a ban on smoking in public places. The 1880s invention of automated cigarette-making machinery in the American South made it possible to mass-produce cigarettes at low cost, and smoking became common in Western countries. This led to a <a href="History%20of%20nicotine%20marketing%23Mass%20production%20and%20temperance%2C%201880%E2%80%931914">backlash and a tobacco prohibition movement</a>, which challenged tobacco use as harmful and brought about some bans on tobacco sale and use.

The <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a> also had anti-tobacco sentiment in the early 20th century. Critics of smoking organized the first anti-tobacco group in the country, named the "Deutscher Tabakgegnerverein zum Schutze der Nichtraucher" (German Tobacco Opponents' Association for the Protection of Non-smokers). Established in 1904, this organization existed for only a brief period. The next anti-tobacco organization, the "Bund Deutscher Tabakgegner" (Federation of German Tobacco Opponents), was established in 1910 in <a href="Trautenau">Trautenau</a>, <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>. Other anti-smoking organizations were established in 1912 in the cities of <a href="Hanover">Hanover</a> and <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a>.

After <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, anti-tobacco movements continued in the German <a href="Weimar%20republic">Weimar republic</a>, against a background of increasing medical research. German researchers were heavily involved with <a href="Health%20effects%20of%20tobacco%23History">early research into tobacco harms</a>. In the 1920s and 1930s, the <a href="Weimar%20Republic">Weimar Republic</a> was at the cutting edge of tobacco research.

In 1920, a "Bund Deutscher Tabakgegner in der Tschechoslowakei" (Federation of German Tobacco Opponents in Czechoslovakia) was formed in <a href="Prague">Prague</a>, after <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a> was separated from <a href="Austria">Austria</a> at the end of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. A "Bund Deutscher Tabakgegner in Deutschösterreich" (Federation of German Tobacco Opponents in <a href="German%20Austria">German Austria</a>) was established in <a href="Graz">Graz</a> in 1920. These groups published journals advocating nonsmoking. The first such <a href="German%20language">German language</a> journal was "Der Tabakgegner" (The Tobacco Opponent), published by the Bohemian organization between 1912 and 1932. "Deutscher Tabakgegner" (German Tobacco Opponent) was published in Dresden from 1919 to 1935, and was the second journal on this subject. The anti-tobacco organizations were also against consumption of <a href="alcoholic%20beverage">alcoholic beverage</a>s.

<a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> was a heavy smoker in his early life—he used to smoke 25 to 40 cigarettes daily—but gave up the habit, concluding that it was "a waste of money". In later years, Hitler viewed smoking as "decadent" and "the wrath of the <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Red Man</a> against the <a href="White%20people">White Man</a>, vengeance for having been given <a href="Distilled%20beverage">hard liquor</a>", lamenting that "so many excellent men have been lost to tobacco poisoning". He was unhappy because both <a href="Eva%20Braun">Eva Braun</a> and <a href="Martin%20Bormann">Martin Bormann</a> were smokers and was concerned over <a href="Hermann%20G%C3%B6ring">Hermann Göring</a>'s continued smoking in public places. He was angered when a statue portraying a cigar-smoking Göring was commissioned. Hitler is often considered to be the first national leader to advocate nonsmoking; however, <a href="James%20VI%20and%20I">James VI and I</a>, king of Scotland and England, was openly <a href="A%20Counterblaste%20to%20Tobacco">against smoking</a> 330 years prior.

Hitler disapproved of the military personnel's freedom to smoke, and during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> he said on 2 March 1942, "it was a mistake, traceable to the army leadership at the time, at the beginning of the war". He also said that it was "not correct to say that a soldier cannot live without smoking". He promised to end the use of tobacco in the military after the end of the war. Hitler personally encouraged close friends not to smoke. He even began to offer a gold watch to any of his inner circle who could <a href="Smoking%20cessation">quit</a>. However, Hitler's personal distaste for tobacco was only one of several catalysts behind the anti-smoking campaign.

In the twenties, many German cigarette firms went bankrupt, and the market was increasingly dominated by a few large, highly automated manufacturers. By 1933, with high unemployment, the <a href="Nazi%20party">Nazi party</a> was attacking the tobacco industry for having foreign and Jewish connections, and for competing with the <a href="Sturm%20Cigarette%20Company">Nazi party's own cigarette company</a>.

The Nazi reproductive policies were a significant factor behind their anti-tobacco campaign. The Nazi leadership wanted German women to <a href="Nazi%20Germany%23Women%27s%20rights">have as many children</a> as possible. Articles and a major medical book published in the 1930s observed an association between smoking (in both men and women) and lower fertility, including more miscarriages. The idea that male fertility was also affected by smoking was not a new one at that time. An article published in a German <a href="gynaecology">gynecology</a> journal in 1943 stated that women smoking three or more cigarettes per day were more likely to remain <a href="childless">childless</a> compared to nonsmoking women. , a prominent physician during the Third Reich, said that smoking by pregnant women resulted in a higher rate of <a href="stillbirth">stillbirth</a>s and <a href="miscarriage">miscarriage</a>s (a claim supported by modern research, for <a href="nicotine">nicotine</a>-using mothers, fathers, and their offspring). This view was also promoted in a 1936 book by well-known female <a href="racial%20hygiene">racial hygienist</a> <a href="Agnes%20Bluhm">Agnes Bluhm</a>.

Women who smoked were viewed as unsuitable to be wives and mothers in a German family. <a href="Werner%20Huttig">Werner Huttig</a> of the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a>'s "<a href="NSDAP%20Office%20of%20Racial%20Policy">Rassenpolitisches Amt</a>" (Office of Racial Politics) said that a <a href="Smoking%20and%20pregnancy">smoking mother</a>'s <a href="breast%20milk">breast milk</a> contained <a href="nicotine">nicotine</a>, a claim that modern research has proven correct. Smoking women were also considered to be vulnerable to premature <a href="aging">aging</a> and loss of <a href="physical%20attractiveness">physical attractiveness</a> (smoking's effects on the skin were studied at the time; smoking does make the skin age faster and was known by 1940 to be linked to earlier death).

There was also concern that mutations caused by cigarette smoking would have irreversible long-term effects on the genetics of the population. Tobacco was described as a "genetic poison" (see <a href="epigenetic%20effects%20of%20smoking">epigenetic effects of smoking</a> for modern research). In Nazi rhetoric, these concerns were connected to racist theories about the "German <a href="germ%20plasm">germ plasm</a>".

Measures protecting non-smokers (especially children and mothers) from passive smoking were tied to the Nazi's desire for healthy young soldiers and workers. They were tied to the concepts of "Volksgesundheit" (People's Health) and "Gesundheitspflicht" (Duty to be Healthy). Physical fitness was promoted, and tobacco use was discouraged as incompatible with physical fitness. Antismoking campaigns were accompanied by other health campaigns, such as discouraging the consumption of alcohol (especially during pregnancy) and encouraging the eating of fruit, vegetables, and whole-wheat bread.

Research on tobacco's effects on population health were more advanced in Germany than in any other nation by the time the Nazis came to power. While a link between smoking and cancers had been observed as early as the 1700s, the <a href="Health%20effects%20of%20tobacco%23Early%20observational%20studies">first good statistical evidence</a> that <a href="Correlation%20and%20dependence">linked</a> smoking to lung cancer and other illnesses was published in Germany and eastern Europe before the Nazi takeover (though some say that the <a href="Lung%20cancer%23Smoking">link</a> between <a href="lung%20cancer">lung cancer</a> and tobacco was first proven in Nazi Germany). Physicians were also aware that smoking was responsible for <a href="cardiac%20disease">cardiac disease</a>s, which were considered to be the most serious disease resulting from smoking. Use of nicotine was sometimes considered to be responsible for increased reports of <a href="myocardial%20infarction">myocardial infarction</a> in the country. In the later years of World War II, researchers considered nicotine a factor behind the coronary heart failures suffered by a significant number of military personnel in the <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Eastern Front</a>. A pathologist of the <a href="German%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">Heer</a> examined thirty-two young soldiers who had died from myocardial infarction at the front, and documented in a 1944 report that all of them were "enthusiastic smokers". He cited the opinion of pathologist Franz Buchner that cigarettes are "a coronary poison of the first order".

The term "<a href="passive%20smoking">passive smoking</a>" (""Passivrauchen"") was coined in Nazi Germany, by <a href="Fritz%20Lickint">Fritz Lickint</a>, a researcher purged from his public position by the Nazis in 1934 for political reasons. While in private practice, Lickint continued his research. In 1935 he published "Der Bronchialkrebs der Raucher" ("Bronchial cancer in smokers"), a follow-up to his 1930 review, "Tabak und Tabakrauch als ätiologische Faktoren des Carcinoms" ("Tobacco and tobacco smoke as <a href="aetiological">aetiological</a> factors in <a href="carcinoma">carcinoma</a>"). The 1935 review attributed the rapidly-rising rates of cancers of the airway to smoking. In 1939 Lickint published "Tabak und Organismus" ("Tobacco and the body"), a book that ran to over 1200 pages, giving a definitive review of existing research into the physiological effects of tobacco. It described smoking as a cause of cancers, cardiovascular diseases, changes in blood composition, lowered fertility, and mutations. It described nicotine use as an addiction, likening it to <a href="alcoholism">alcoholism</a> and suggesting similar treatments. It also suggested anti-smoking public health measures, including measures against passive smoking. Lickint was in military service from 1939–1945; he survived and continued his research after the war.

Further observational studies were done in Nazi Germany and the wartime Netherlands. Nazi Germany supported <a href="Epidemiology">epidemiological research</a> on the harmful effects of tobacco use. Hitler personally gave financial support to the "Wissenschaftliches Institut zur Erforschung der Tabakgefahren" (Institute for Tobacco Hazards Research) at the <a href="University%20of%20Jena">University of Jena</a>, in <a href="Thuringia">Thuringia</a>, headed by <a href="Karl%20Astel">Karl Astel</a>. Established in 1941, it was the most significant anti-tobacco institute in Nazi Germany. However, it never had its own buildings or staff, nor regular funding, and overall its research into the dangers of tobacco was limited, and only of marginal scientific significance and repute. Further research into the effects of tobacco on health was carried out with Nazi funding. In 1939, <a href="Franz%20H.%20M%C3%BCller">Franz H. Müller</a> (a member of the <a href="National%20Socialist%20Motor%20Corps">National Socialist Motor Corps</a> or NSKK, and the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a>) published a study reporting a higher prevalence of lung cancer among smokers. The study had serious weaknesses in its methodology, but study design problems were better addressed in subsequent studies. <a href="Dietrich%20Eberhard%20Schairer">Dietrich Eberhard Schairer</a> also used <a href="case-control">case-control</a> epidemiological methods to study lung cancer among smokers, in 1943. Due to the research institute and local political support, including from <a href="Fritz%20Sauckel">Fritz Sauckel</a> (the <a href="Gauleiter">Gauleiter</a> of Thuringia) and <a href="Leonardo%20Conti">Leonardo Conti</a> (the Reich Health Leader), Thuringia became a test bed for anti-smoking measures, most of which were never implemented elsewhere.

After 1941, Nazi tobacco research was deliberately slowed, along with other restrictions on anti-tobacco publications. At the end of the war, the fates of those involved in supporting and carrying out research varied. Kurt Astel, who was heavily involved in mass murder and research practices which would probably have seen him tried as a war criminal, killed himself. Fritz Sauckel was executed for <a href="crimes%20against%20humanity">crimes against humanity</a>. Leonardo Conti killed himself while awaiting trial for his involvement in <a href="Aktion%20T4">mass murder of ill people</a>. <a href="Hans%20Reiter%20%28physician%29">Hans Reiter</a> (the Reich Health Office president) was interned for two years and spent the rest of his career in private practice. Others worked in the field after the war; pharmacologist Gustav Kuschinsky continued work similar to that begun with funding from Astel's institute with funding from the cigarette company <a href="Reemtsma">Reemtsma</a>. Fritz Lickint was appointed to public hospital and teaching posts again after the war.

Many wartime research publications were never shipped abroad, and after the war, pre-war and wartime publications on nicotine were ignored even within Germany. <a href="Health%20effects%20of%20tobacco%23Causality">Post-war research</a>ers were unaware of the earlier non-English-language studies. They therefore duplicated the <a href="case-control%20study">case-control studies</a> showing the association with illness before doing <a href="prospective%20cohort%20studies">prospective cohort studies</a> that established <a href="causality">causality</a> in the 1950s. There is a popular belief that <a href="United%20States">American</a> and <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> scientists <a href="Health%20effects%20of%20tobacco%23History">first discovered</a> the health harms of tobacco in the 1950s.

There was never a coherent Nazi policy to impede smoking. Mostly, measures were based on pre-existing policies. Although in some places some stern measures were taken, tobacco control policy was incoherent and ineffective, and obvious measures were not taken. Tobacco controls were often not enforced. Smoking bans were widely ignored. Measures reached their peak in 1939-1941, after which some were rolled back or actively prevented.

There was great regional variation in tobacco policies, making it possible to find wildly contradictory individual examples. Almost no anti-smoking efforts were made in Nazi <a href="Austria">Austria</a>, for instance. In <a href="Jena">Jena</a>, <a href="Thuringia">Thuringia</a>, very strong anti-smoking measures were enacted, due to the power of <a href="Karl%20Astel">Karl Astel</a> there and his support from <a href="Fritz%20Sauckel">Fritz Sauckel</a> (the <a href="Gauleiter">Gauleiter</a> of Thuringia) and <a href="Leonardo%20Conti">Leonardo Conti</a> (the Reich Health Leader). These measures included the first 20th-century university campus smoking ban. There were many small, local anti-tobacco measures, which were often unapproved and indeed viewed negatively by the Nazi Party.

The Nazi anti-tobacco policies were not free of contradictions. For example, the "Volksgesundheit" (People's Health) and "Gesundheitspflicht" (Duty to be Healthy) policies were enforced in parallel with the active distribution of cigarettes to people who the Nazis saw as "deserving" groups (e.g. frontline soldiers, members of the Hitler Youth). On the other hand, "undeserving" and stigmatized groups (Jews, war prisoners) were denied access to tobacco.

The Nazis used several public relations tactics to convince the general population of Germany not to smoke, and gave variable support to non-officially-approved propaganda. National and local government organizations, party-controlled organizations, voluntary organizations, and medical organizations were all involved. The messages differed; propaganda by Nazi Party organizations generally described tobacco as harmful to women or young people, while publications by medical professionals tended to describe the health hazards of smoking. In 1941, the propaganda ministry issued orders to "completely cease any anti-tobacco propaganda in the public", with minor exceptions, which had to be submitted for censorship.

The Public Health Office issued repeatedly made precise public statements about the health harms of smoking (under both <a href="Gerhard%20Wagner%20%28physician%29">Gerhard Wagner</a> and his successor, Leonardo Conti). The "Reich Health Office" also issued warnings, and the "Reich Bureau Against the Dangers of Alcohol and Tobacco" was founded. In June 1939, a Bureau against the Hazards of Alcohol and Tobacco was formed and the "Reichsstelle für Rauschgiftbekämpfung" (Reich Office for Drug Control) also helped in the anti-tobacco campaign. The anti-smoking campaign undertaken by the Nazis also included health education.

The <a href="Deutsche%20Arbeitsfront">Deutsche Arbeitsfront</a> (the government monopoly union) also ran anti-smoking campaigns. An anti-smoking speech by its head met with official disapproval. Anti-smoking messages were sent to the people in their workplaces, often with the help of the <a href="Hitler%20Youth">Hitler-Jugend</a> (HJ) and the <a href="League%20of%20German%20Girls">Bund Deutscher Mädel</a> (BDM).

Well-known health magazines like the "Gesundes Volk" (Healthy People), "Volksgesundheit" (People's Health) and "Gesundes Leben" (Healthy Life) also published warnings about the health consequences of smoking and posters showing the harmful effects of tobacco were displayed. Some anti-smoking posters were unapproved and indeed censured by the government. Editorials discussing the issue of smoking and its effects were published in newspapers. Articles advocating nonsmoking were also published in the magazines "Die Genussgifte" (The Recreational Stimulants), "Auf der Wacht" (On the Guard) and "Reine Luft" (Clean Air). Out of these magazines, "Reine Luft" was the main journal of the anti-tobacco movement. Karl Astel's Institute for Tobacco Hazards Research at Jena University purchased and distributed hundreds of reprints from "Reine Luft". The magazine was published by tobacco control activists; it was later, in 1941, ordered by the propaganda ministry to moderate its tone and submit all material for pre-approval.

Restrictions were imposed on the advertisement of tobacco products, enacted on 7 December 1941 and signed by Heinrich Hunke, the President of the Advertising Council. Advertisements trying to depict smoking as harmless or as an expression of masculinity were banned. Ridiculing anti-tobacco activists was also outlawed, as was the use of advertising posters along rail tracks, in rural regions, stadiums and racing tracks. Advertising by loudspeakers and <a href="Postage%20stamps%20and%20postal%20history%20of%20Germany%23Nazi%20Germany%2C%201933-1945">mail</a> was also prohibited. A ban on tobacco advertising was decided against by <a href="Max%20Amann">Max Amann</a> (Hitler's secretary, Reich Leader for the Press, and Leader of the Party Publishing Company, <a href="Eher%20Verlag">Eher Verlag</a>). However, advertising restrictions remained in place, even after 1941, and there was a plan to tighten them, although proposals to restrict tobacco ads to statements of manufacturer, brand, and price were explicitly rejected by the party.

"Nichtraucherschutz" (the protection of non-smokers [from <a href="passive%20smoking">passive smoking</a>]) was the principle behind some bans. In 1941, tobacco smoking in trams was outlawed in sixty German cities. In 1944, smoking in buses and city trains was made illegal, on the personal initiative of Hitler, who feared female <a href="Bus%20conductor">ticket collector</a>s might be the victims of passive smoking.

Smoking was also banned not only in health care institutions, but also in several public offices and in rest homes. Midwives were restricted from smoking while on duty. Smoking was also outlawed in <a href="bomb%20shelter">bomb shelter</a>s; however, some shelters had separate rooms for smoking. In 1939, the Nazi Party outlawed smoking in all of its offices premises, and <a href="Heinrich%20Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a>, the then chief of the <a href="Schutzstaffel">Schutzstaffel</a> (SS), restricted police personnel from smoking while they were on duty. In 1938, the <a href="Reichspost">Reichspost</a> imposed a ban on smoking.

Special care was taken to discourage pregnant women and youth from smoking. The president of the Medical Association in Germany announced, "German women don't smoke". Pregnant women, and women below the age of 25 and over the age of 55, were not given tobacco ration cards during World War II. Restrictions on selling tobacco products to women were imposed on the hospitality and food retailing industry, though restrictions on women smoking in restaurants were officially rejected by the Nazi party. Anti-tobacco films aimed at women were publicly shown. Some local measures were quite strict; for instance, one district department of the <a href="National%20Socialist%20Factory%20Cell%20Organization">National Socialist Factory Cell Organization</a> (NSBO) announced that it would expel <a href="Women%20in%20Nazi%20Germany">female members</a> who smoked publicly. Some women working in arms factories, however, were given special cigarette rations.

Smoking was also outlawed inside schools in 1939. In July 1943, public smoking for persons under the age of 18 was outlawed, although under-18s were still allowed to purchase and privately smoke tobacco (the US and UK had less lenient regulations).

Restrictions on smoking were also introduced in the <a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a>. Soldiers were not issued with more than six free cigarettes per day. Extra cigarettes were often sold to the soldiers, especially when there was no military advance or retreat in the battleground; however, these were restricted to 50 for each person per month. Non-smokers could get alternate rations, such as food and chocolate. Teenaged soldiers serving in the <a href="12th%20SS%20Panzer%20Division%20Hitlerjugend">12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend</a>, composed of <a href="Hitler%20Youth">Hitler Youth</a> members, were given confectionery instead of tobacco products, although other Hitler Youth members were given cigarettes. The Wehrmacht's <a href="Women%27s%20roles%20in%20the%20World%20Wars%23Germany">female auxiliary personnel</a> were not given cigarette rations. Medical lectures were arranged to persuade military personnel to quit smoking.

In 1938, the <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> imposed a ban on smoking. In 1939, <a href="Heinrich%20Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a>, the then chief of the <a href="Schutzstaffel">Schutzstaffel</a> (SS), restricted police personnel and SS officers from smoking while they were on duty. The JAMA also reported that <a href="Hermann%20Goering">Hermann Goering</a> had banned soldiers from smoking when on the streets, on marches, or only briefly off-duty.

The <a href="Sturmabteilung">Nazi paramilitary SA</a> was <a href="Sturm%20Cigarette%20Company">funded by cigarette royalties</a>, and violently promoted the sales of their own cigarette brands. After the <a href="Night%20of%20the%20Long%20Knives">Night of the Long Knives</a>, the <a href="Reemtsma">Reemtsma</a> cigarette company paid a fixed fee (a quarter-million marks for the first year) to produce the SA's permitted cigarettes. A plan to establish a state tobacco monopoly was not carried out.

Efforts were made to keep cigarettes freely available. In the inter-war period, cigarettes were made with tobacco from Greece, Bulgaria, and Turkey. Pipe tobacco and cigar tobacco often came from overseas, so the war disrupted their availability. The tobacco industry worked closely with occupying forces in the <a href="Crimea">Crimea</a>, where forced labour, including child labour, was used to harvest tobacco. <a href="Forced%20labour%20under%20German%20rule%20during%20World%20War%20II">Forced labour</a> was used in cigarette manufacture, with prison camps set up at some locations. More cigarettes were made with less tobacco, to stretch the supply. Demand was also controlled; "undeserving" groups were forbidden to enter tobacconists, and later from buying tobacco.

An ordinance enacted on 3 November 1941 raised tobacco taxes by approximately 80–95% of the retail price. It would be the highest rise in tobacco taxes in Germany until more than 25 years after the <a href="Nazi%20Germany%23Capitulation%20of%20German%20forces">collapse of the Nazi regime</a>. By 1941, tobacco taxes made up about a twelfth of state income, and antismoking efforts were being discouraged.

Despite these efforts, in 1942 there was a shortage of tobacco, and 2/3 of all German tobacco factories were shut down, some to be converted into armaments factories. Tobacco went on the <a href="ration">ration</a>: smokers were not allowed to buy more than a limited amount. Cigarette consumption stopped rising rapidly and fell rapidly, although the number of smokers continued to rise.

Some senior Nazi officials were opposed to anti-tobacco measures. <a href="Hermann%20Goering">Hermann Goering</a> publicly smoked cigars, despite Hitler's opposition. <a href="Joseph%20Goebbels">Joseph Goebbels</a> felt that cigarettes were essential to the war effort, and (as propaganda minister) restricted anti-tobacco propaganda, arguing that anti-smoking campaigns were incompatible with free cigarettes being issued to millions serving in the military, legal tobacco advertising, and authority figures who smoked and denied the dangers of smoking. Despite government regulations, many women in Germany regularly smoked, including the wives of many high-ranking Nazi officials. For instance, <a href="Magda%20Goebbels">Magda Goebbels</a> smoked even while she was being interviewed by a journalist. <a href="Eva%20Braun">Eva Braun</a> also smoked.

The <a href="tobacco%20industry">tobacco industry</a> worked to counter the <a href="Nazi%20Germany%23Government">government</a> campaign to prevent women from smoking and used smoking models in their advertisements. Fashion illustrations displaying women with cigarettes were often published in prominent publications such as the "Beyers Mode für Alle" (Beyers Fashion For All). The cover of the popular song "<a href="Lili%20Marleen">Lili Marleen</a>" featured singer <a href="Lale%20Andersen">Lale Andersen</a> holding a cigarette.

The cigarette manufacturing companies in Germany made several attempts to weaken the scientific credibility of the anti-tobacco campaign. They tried to depict the anti-tobacco movement as "fanatic" and "unscientific". They published new journals (with titles such as "Chronica Nicotiana" and "Der Tabak: Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift der Internationalen Tabakwissenschaftlichen Gesellschaft", or "Tobacco: the scientific journal of the International Tobacco Scientific Society"). One industry-funded tobacco counter-research institute, the "Tabacologia medicinalis", was shut down by Reich Health Leader <a href="Leonardo%20Conti">Leonardo Conti</a>. Another such "academy" was called "Academia Nicotiana Internationalis".

While some cigarette ads had been banned from Nazi party publications due to Jewish ownership, the publications lost money, and the early party needed money for election campaigning. In June 1932, Hitler personally made a deal for half a million marks worth of cigarette advertising. Tobacco companies also made unparalleled financial contributions to Nazi causes; the <a href="Sturmabteilung">Sturmabteilung</a> and other party organizations were repeatedly given six-figure sums, and the <a href="Hitler%20Youth">Hitler Youth</a> were given an aircraft. <a href="Reemtsma">One cigarette company</a> paid over 12.3 million reichsmarks in bribes to <a href="Hermann%20G%C3%B6ring">Hermann Göring</a>.

The early anti-smoking campaign was considered a failure, and from 1933 to 1937 there was a rapid increase in tobacco consumption in Germany. The rate of smoking in the nation increased faster even than in neighboring <a href="France">France</a>, where the anti-tobacco movement was tiny and far less influential. Between 1932 and 1939, <a href="per%20capita">per capita</a> cigarette consumption in Germany increased from 570 to 900 per year, while the corresponding numbers for France were from 570 to 630. After 1938, <a href="WWII">the war</a> prevented the publication of sales figures. Tobacco consumption rose until 1942, when tobacco went on the <a href="rationing">ration</a>, due to supply shortages. The number of smokers continued to rise, but smokers could not buy as many cigarettes, so total tobacco consumption fell.

Free and subsidized branded cigarettes were <a href="military%20and%20smoking">distributed to soldiers</a> on both sides during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, as part of rations. Smoking rates rose more rapidly during war than in peacetime, including among women. Serving in the military, participating in military deployments, and physical and mental disability all make people more likely to smoke. Generally, people who are already stressed, anxious, depressed, or otherwise suffering from poor moods get addicted more easily and find quitting more difficult. This is thought to be because nicotine withdrawal worsens mood in smokers, with a nicotine hit briefly bringing mood back to baseline; if, due to pre-existing mood problems, the baseline is lower, then the withdrawal is worse still.

Smoking was common in the <a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a>; a 1944 survey found that 87% of servicemen smoked. 10% of servicemen had begun smoking while in the military, and only seven servicemen of the thousand surveyed (0.7%) had given it up. However, as in the general population, the number of smokers rose while the number of cigarettes smoked fell. As a result of the anti-tobacco measures implemented in the Wehrmacht (supply restriction, taxes, and propaganda), the total tobacco consumption by soldiers decreased between 1939 and 1945. Average tobacco consumption per person among military personnel declined by 23.4% compared to the immediate pre-World War II years. The number of servicemen who smoked 30 or more cigarettes per day (well above the theoretical maximum military ration of 7.7 cigarettes per day) declined from 4.4% to 0.3%.

Apart from public health concerns, the Nazis were heavily influenced by ideology; specifically, the movement was influenced by concepts of "<a href="racial%20hygiene">racial hygiene</a>" and bodily purity. Some Nazi leaders believed that it was wrong for the "<a href="master%20race">master race</a>" to smoke and that tobacco consumption was equal to "racial degeneracy". Tobacco-caused infertility and <a href="epigenetic%20effects%20of%20smoking">hereditary damage</a> (described in now-obsolete terms as "corrupt[ion]" of the "<a href="germ%20plasm">germ plasm</a>") were considered problematic by the Nazis on the grounds that they harmed German "<a href="racial%20hygiene">racial hygiene</a>".

Nazi anti-tobacco activists often tried to depict tobacco as a vice of "the degenerate <a href="Negroes">Negroes</a>". The Nazis claimed that <a href="Jew">Jew</a>s were responsible for introducing tobacco and its harmful effects. The <a href="Seventh-day%20Adventist%20Church">Seventh-day Adventist Church</a> in Germany announced that smoking was an unhealthy vice spread by Jews. During the opening ceremony of the aforementioned "Wissenschaftliches Institut zur Erforschung der Tabakgefahren" in 1941, <a href="Johann%20von%20Leers">Johann von Leers</a>, editor of the "Nordische Welt" (Nordic World), proclaimed that "Jewish capitalism" was responsible for the spread of tobacco use across <a href="Europe">Europe</a>. He said that the first tobacco on German soil was brought by the Jews and that they controlled the tobacco industry in <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, the principal European entry point of "<a href="Nicotiana">Nicotiana</a>".

After the collapse of Nazi Germany at the <a href="End%20of%20World%20War%20II%20in%20Europe">end of World War II</a>, illegal <a href="smuggling">smuggling</a> of tobacco became prevalent, and the anti-smoking campaign started by the Nazis ceased to exist after the fall of the Third Reich. In 1949, approximately 400 million cigarettes manufactured in the United States entered Germany illegally every month. In 1954, nearly two billion <a href="Switzerland">Swiss</a> cigarettes were smuggled into Germany and <a href="Italy">Italy</a>. As part of the <a href="Marshall%20Plan">Marshall Plan</a>, the United States paid to send tobacco to Germany free of charge; the amount of tobacco shipped into Germany in 1948 was 24,000 tons and was as high as 69,000 tons in 1949. Post-war consumption in Germany remained initially low, due to poverty. Per capita yearly cigarette consumption in <a href="History%20of%20Germany%20since%201945">post-war Germany</a> steadily rose from 460 in 1950 to 1,523 in 1963.

Nazi-related rhetoric associating anti-smoking measures with fascism has been fairly widely used in <a href="nicotine%20marketing">nicotine marketing</a> (except in Germany, where such comparisons have brought strong reactions). Historical research has been quoted in a selective manner, which has been criticized by the quoted historians. In the early 21st century, this Nazi rhetoric may be being supplanted by <a href="Taliban">Taliban</a>-related rhetoric associating anti-smoking measures with theocracy.

It has been argued that the Nazi anti-tobacco campaigns delayed effective <a href="nicotine%20addiction">nicotine addiction</a> reduction measures by decades. At the end of the 20th century, the anti-tobacco campaign in Germany was unable to approach the level of the Nazi-era climax in the years 1939–41, and German tobacco health research was described by <a href="Robert%20N.%20Proctor">Robert N. Proctor</a> as "muted". Modern Germany has some of Europe's least restrictive tobacco control policies, and more Germans both smoke and die of it in consequence, which also leads to higher public health costs.

Lince (tank)

The Lince (, meaning "<a href="Lynx">Lynx</a>") was a <a href="Spain">Spanish</a> development programme for a proposed <a href="main%20battle%20tank">main battle tank</a> that unfolded during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The intention was to replace the <a href="M47%20Patton">M47</a> and <a href="M48%20Patton">M48 Patton</a> tanks that the <a href="Spanish%20Army">Spanish Army</a> had received under the U.S. <a href="Mutual%20Defense%20Assistance%20Act">Mutual Defense Assistance Act</a> between 1954 and 1975, and to complement the <a href="AMX-30E">AMX-30E</a> tanks manufactured for the army during the 1970s. Companies from several nations, such as German <a href="Krauss-Maffei">Krauss-Maffei</a>, Spanish Santa Bárbara, and French <a href="Nexter">GIAT</a>, made bids for the development contract. The main priorities were mobility and firepower, with secondary priority placed on protection; the Lince tank was to have been lighter and faster than its competitors. The vehicle's size would also have been restricted by the Spanish rail and highway network. To achieve a sufficient level of firepower and protection, given the size requirements, the Lince was to use <a href="Rheinmetall">Rheinmetall's</a> <a href="Rheinmetall%20120%20mm%20gun">120 mm L/44 tank-gun</a> and German <a href="composite%20armour">composite armour</a> from the <a href="Leopard%202">Leopard 2A4</a>.

The Spanish government decided to upgrade its fleet of AMX-30Es in the late 1980s. The focus on upgrading Spain's AMX-30E's distracted attention from the Lince plan, which was eventually shelved in 1990 after Spain acquired a large number of <a href="M60%20Patton">M60 Patton</a> tanks, which were no longer required by the U.S., in accordance with the <a href="Treaty%20on%20Conventional%20Armed%20Forces%20in%20Europe">Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe</a>. These tanks replaced the M47s and M48s, and fulfilled Spain's need to modernize its tank forces in the short term. No prototype of the planned Lince tank was manufactured, and no announcements were made on who would receive the contract. Four years later the Spanish government procured and locally manufactured the Leopard 2, fulfilling the long-term modernisation goal established in the Lince programme.

During the 1950s the Spanish Army was supplied by the United States with 552 <a href="M47%20Patton">M47</a> and <a href="M48%20Patton">M48 Patton</a> tanks as a <a href="Mutual%20Defense%20Assistance%20Act">mutual defense pact</a> against a potential <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> invasion of Western Europe. The first tanks were delivered in 1954, and the fleet was upgraded in the 1970s to equal the capabilities of <a href="M60%20Patton">M60 Patton</a> tanks. Spain was, however, interested in replacing these tanks as early as the 1960s with the French <a href="AMX-30">AMX-30</a> or German . Spain eventually decided to buy the French tank and by 1975 the Spanish Army had 299 AMX-30s, designated as AMX-30Es. Of these, 280 tanks were manufactured by the local company Empresa Nacional Santa Bárbara (now <a href="General%20Dynamics%20Santa%20B%C3%A1rbara%20Sistemas">Santa Bárbara Sistemas</a>) who received the AMX-30 patent from the French company <a href="Nexter">GIAT</a>. As the first batch of production of AMX-30s ended, the French Army and Santa Bárbara began a research programme for an eventual modernisation of the AMX-30 to correct deficiencies such as mechanical reliability, armor protection and the fire control system. In fielding the AMX-30E, the army found its upgraded M47s and M48s to be outdated; its earliest M47 tank was more than 30 years old. The army required a modern tank that could complement its AMX-30Es and started looking for a replacement for its Patton fleet.
In 1984, the Spanish Ministry of Defense declared its intent to set aside 120 billion <a href="Spanish%20peseta">pesetas</a> (1.1 billion <a href="US%20Dollar">U.S. dollars</a>) for a future tank program and attracted interest from five foreign companies. German company Krauss-Maffei and Spanish company Santa Bárbara presented a joint bid in mid-1984 that would produce a tank based on 1970s technology. The French government proposed to cooperate with Spain in designing a tank complete with new technology—France would later develop this programme on its own as the <a href="Leclerc%20tank">AMX-Leclerc</a>. However, the French admitted that there would be restrictions placed on Empresa Nacional Santa Bárbara when it came to exporting the tank. The Italian government proposed a similar deal for a cooperative tank design. The American company <a href="General%20Dynamics">General Dynamics</a> and British company <a href="Vickers">Vickers</a> offered the <a href="M1%20Abrams">M1 Abrams</a> and <a href="Vickers%20MBT">Valiant</a>, respectively; the Spanish government rejected their offers the following year because of the low likelihood of local production and export of the tank. By late 1985, the only offers still under consideration were those from the German-Spanish collaboration and the French and Italian governments.

Krauss-Maffei's Lince bid provided the clearest technical designs. The tank would be 49 tonnes and equipped with a 120-millimeter main gun. It could fire this gun on the move and aim at targets with effectiveness in day and night operations. Fitted with a engine, the Lince could travel as fast as on the roads. Although heavily based on the Leopard 2A4, the Lince was smaller and lighter, trading protection for mobility. Specifically, the Lince prioritised enhanced mobility over the irregular Spanish terrain. Furthermore, size restrictions were imposed because of the existing capabilities of Spain's railroad and highway network. Although the reduced armor conflicted with the problems that the Spanish had with AMX-30E's thin armor, the Lince used a multilayer armor similar to that of the German Leopard 2A4, providing greater protection than standard armor for a similar weight. The protection was further enhanced by the low profile turret, again similar to that of the Leopard 2A4.

In early 1986, the Ministry of Defense declared that it would choose a contract within a matter of months. News sources cited said that Krauss-Maffei would most likely gain the contract, although the French might get it because of past and existing French armament contracts with Spain. Apart from producing the French-designed AMX-30, the Spanish government also had a contract for <a href="Dassault%20Mirage%20F1">Mirage F1</a> fighter planes and <a href="A%C3%A9rospatiale%20Puma">Puma utility helicopters</a> in 1979. In early 1987, France again offered Spain the contract to co-develop and co-produce the <a href="Leclerc%20tank">AMX-Leclerc</a>. This time it added the lucrative term of joint export. Despite the offer and ongoing collaboration with the Italians, Spanish investment in the German-Spanish Lince program grew to 200 billion pesetas (1.8 billion dollars). However, the Spanish government did not announce a winner for the contract. This indecision led Krauss-Maffei to freeze its bid for the Lince. Krauss-Maffei also cited the loss of millions of dollars because of failures on the part of Santa Bárbara Sistemas, who would manufacture the Lince.

The Spanish Ministry of Defense agreed to modernise the Army's AMX-30Es in 1987 and allotted 16 billion pesetas (155 million <a href="dollars">dollars</a>) to the programme. From , the Army upgraded its entire AMX-30E fleet to EM1 and EM2 standards. This upgraded programme posed a threat to the Lince programme. Around the same time, the Spanish government expressed interest in acquiring American M60 Patton tanks that were being retired from Central Europe, in accordance with the <a href="Treaty%20on%20Conventional%20Armed%20Forces%20in%20Europe">Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe</a>. In October and November, the Spanish government began to negotiate for 400 to 500 M60A1 and M60A3 tanks, and planned to upgrade its acquired M60A1 tanks to M60A3 standards. In December, the United States agreed to transfer 532 M60A1 and M60A3 tanks to replace Spain's M47s and M48s. After receiving 50 of the 272 A1s, Spain cancelled procurement of these tanks and opted to receive only the 260 M60A3s. Because of the modernisation of the AMX-30, the decision to replace older Patton tanks with the M60A3 and Krauss-Maffei's criticism of the management of the indigenous tank programme, the Lince was canceled in 1989. Management issues in Santa Bárbara Sistemas also played a part, including yearly negative balances and the reduction of factory personnel. However, unlike the planned Lince, the M60s only satisfied Spain's immediate need to modernise the Army's tank fleet in the short term. They were not a long-term modernisation solution as Spain's M47s and M48s had already been upgraded to equivalents of the M60.

As a result, Spain negotiated with Germany over the procurement and local production of a large number of Leopard 2A5s; a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the two in 1995, and the Germans lent 108 Leopard 2A4s to the Spanish Army for five years starting in 1998. In 2005, the Spanish Ministry of Defense declared intention to buy the tanks instead of renting them. The local production terms in the Memorandum allowed Santa Bárbara Sistemas to start producing <a href="Leopard%202E">Leopard 2E</a>s in 2003, and the first platoon of tanks was delivered in . In comparison to the smaller Lince, the Leopard 2A4 weighs and is powered by a diesel engine. The greater weight of the Leopard 2A4 is due in part to its thicker armor, affording greater protection and balancing out the loss in mobility as compared to the Lince.

McCormick Tribune Plaza &amp; Ice Rink

McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink or McCormick Tribune Plaza is a multi-purpose venue within <a href="Millennium%20Park">Millennium Park</a> in the <a href="Chicago%20Loop">Loop</a> <a href="Community%20areas%20of%20Chicago">community area</a> of <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>, in the United States. On December 20, 2001, it became the first attraction in Millennium Park to open. The $3.2 million plaza was funded by a donation from the McCormick Tribune Foundation. It has served as an <a href="ice%20skating%20rink">ice skating rink</a>, a dining facility and briefly as an open-air exhibition space.

The plaza operates as McCormick Tribune Ice Rink, a free public outdoor <a href="ice%20skating">ice skating</a> rink that is generally open four months a year, from mid-November until mid-March, when it hosts over 100,000 skaters annually. It is known as one of Chicago's better outdoor <a href="people-watching">people-watching</a> locations during the winter months. It is operated by the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs rather than the <a href="Chicago%20Park%20District">Chicago Park District</a>, which operates most major public ice skating rinks in Chicago.

For the rest of the year, it serves as Plaza at Park Grill or Park Grill Plaza, Chicago's largest outdoor dining facility. The 150-seat park grill hosts various culinary events as well as music during its months of outdoor operation, and it is affiliated with the 300-seat indoor <a href="Park%20Grill">Park Grill</a> restaurant located beneath <a href="AT%26amp%3BT%20Plaza">AT&T Plaza</a> and "<a href="Cloud%20Gate">Cloud Gate</a>". The outdoor restaurant offers scenic views of the park.

Lying between <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Lake Michigan</a> to the east and the Loop to the west, <a href="Grant%20Park%20%28Chicago%29">Grant Park</a> has been Chicago's front yard since the mid-19th century. Its northwest corner, north of Monroe Street and the <a href="Art%20Institute%20of%20Chicago">Art Institute</a>, east of <a href="Michigan%20Avenue%20%28Chicago%29">Michigan Avenue</a>, south of <a href="Randolph%20Street">Randolph Street</a>, and west of <a href="Columbus%20Drive%20%28Chicago%29">Columbus Drive</a>, had been <a href="Illinois%20Central%20Railroad">Illinois Central</a> rail yards and parking lots until 1997 when it was made available for development by the city as Millennium Park. As of 2007, Millennium Park, which is located in the northwest corner of Grant Park, trails only <a href="Navy%20Pier">Navy Pier</a> as a Chicago tourist attraction.

The earliest plans for Millennium Park were unveiled by <a href="Mayor%20of%20Chicago">Chicago's mayor</a>, <a href="Richard%20M.%20Daley">Richard M. Daley</a>, in March 1998 and included "a reflecting pool that would double as a skating rink in winter". The architectural firm of <a href="Skidmore%2C%20Owings%20%26amp%3B%20Merrill">Skidmore, Owings & Merrill</a> came up with the master plan for the park; their original design for the ice rink placed it along upper Randolph Street, on the park's northern edge. However, McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink was built on the western edge of Millennium Park. The "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>"'s <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>-winning architecture critic <a href="Blair%20Kamin">Blair Kamin</a> called this move "a masterstroke" and praised the new location "where the skaters symbolize the year-round vitality of the city". Kamin noted the location on the east side of Michigan Avenue allowed those at the plaza and ice rink to enjoy the skyline of the <a href="Historic%20Michigan%20Boulevard%20District">Historic Michigan Boulevard District</a>. Another addition to the plaza and rink's design was the 300-seat restaurant; the final architectural design was completed by OWP&P Architects, who were also the architects for the adjoining <a href="Wrigley%20Square">Wrigley Square</a>.

Although the rink was budgeted for <a href="U.S.%20Dollar">$</a>5 million, it was constructed for only $3.2 million ($ million today), making it one of the few Millennium Park attractions to cost less than was initially budgeted. The rink was funded by and named for the McCormick Tribune Foundation, which was established by former "Chicago Tribune" owner and publisher <a href="Robert%20R.%20McCormick">Robert R. McCormick</a>. The McCormick Tribune Foundation is a supporter of the <a href="McCormick%20Tribune%20Freedom%20Museum">McCormick Tribune Freedom Museum</a> and the <a href="McCormick%20Tribune%20Campus%20Center">McCormick Tribune Campus Center</a> at the <a href="Illinois%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Illinois Institute of Technology</a>, both of which are also located in Chicago.
McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink was the first feature in Millennium Park to open. Its grand opening was celebrated on December 20, 2001, a few weeks ahead of the Millennium Park underground <a href="parking%20garage">parking garage</a>. Mayor Daley, McCormick Tribune Foundation Chairman of the Board John W. Madigan, Millennium Park private donor group chief <a href="John%20H.%20Bryan">John Bryan</a>, actress <a href="Bonnie%20Hunt">Bonnie Hunt</a> and other local celebrities attended the event. The new ice rink was seen as a replacement for "Skate on State", a public skating rink on <a href="State%20Street%20%28Chicago%29">State Street</a> in the Loop which closed in 2001.

From June 21 to September 15, 2002, McCormick Tribune Plaza hosted the inaugural exhibit in Millennium Park, "<a href="Exelon">Exelon</a> Presents Earth From Above" by <a href="Yann%20Arthus-Bertrand">Yann Arthus-Bertrand</a>, a French <a href="aerial%20photography">aerial photographer</a>. Arthus-Bertrand used planes and helicopters to photograph sites in over 60 countries on every continent, and displayed more than 120 of these photographs in dozens of cities, starting in <a href="Paris">Paris</a> and including <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> and <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a>. In the summer of 2002, the book associated with the exhibit had sold over 1.5 million copies, and the photographs were displayed in <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>, <a href="Poland">Poland</a>, <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="United%20Kingdom">Britain</a>, <a href="Norway">Norway</a>, <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a> and along the banks of the <a href="Volga%20River">Volga River</a> in <a href="Russia">Russia</a>.

Chicago was the first American city to host the "Earth From Above" exhibition. The exhibit featured photographic prints that were <a href="laminate">laminate</a>d onto thin <a href="aluminum">aluminum</a> panels that protected them from <a href="ultraviolet%20rays">ultraviolet rays</a>. The photographs included scenes of natural beauty such as a <a href="Filipino%20people">Filipino</a> <a href="Bajau">Bajau</a> village built on <a href="coral%20reef">coral reef</a>s, a formation of rocks in <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, an inlet in the <a href="Ionian%20Islands">Ionian Islands</a> that is home to <a href="endangered%20sea%20turtles">endangered sea turtles</a>, and architectural highlights such as the <a href="Palace%20of%20Versailles">Palace of Versailles</a> and the <a href="Hagia%20Sophia">Hagia Sophia</a> in Istanbul. It also showed scenes of tragedy such as the 1999 earthquake in <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> and the destruction of the <a href="Amazon%20Rainforest">Amazonian</a> <a href="rain%20forest">rain forest</a>. The exhibit used <a href="photovoltaic">photovoltaic</a> solar panels to store electrical energy during the day that then lit the exhibit at night.

Part of the 2006 film "<a href="The%20Weather%20Man">The Weather Man</a>", starring <a href="Nicolas%20Cage">Nicolas Cage</a>, was shot at the rink. In 2008, Millennium Park hosted a winter celebration called the Museum of Modern Ice. The installation included a ice wall in the park and a large abstract painting by <a href="Gordon%20Halloran">Gordon Halloran</a>, which was embedded in the McCormick Tribune Ice Rink. The works were titled "Paintings Below Zero." In 2008–2009 the logo for the unsuccessful <a href="Chicago%20bid%20for%20the%202016%20Summer%20Olympics">Chicago bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics</a> was displayed in the rink's ice.

The ice rink served as the "headquarters" for the 2011 edition of <a href="Hockey%20Weekend%20Across%20America">Hockey Weekend Across America</a>; the <a href="NHL%20on%20NBC">NHL on NBC</a> broadcast its studio coverage from the rink on February 20 of that year. <a href="Eddie%20Olczyk">Eddie Olczyk</a> opened the show by skating with the <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a> in the Millennium Park rink.

The ice skating rink at McCormick Tribune Plaza is . Due to the rink's rounded corners, the total skating surface is , which critic Blair Kamin called "amply sized". For comparison, this is a considerably larger skating surface than the <a href="Rockefeller%20Center">Rockefeller Center</a> rink in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, which is .

The Millennium Park rink has a lobby which provides skaters a respite from the natural environs, as well as toilets and public lockers. During the 2003–04 season the rink rented 77,667 pairs of <a href="ice%20skates">ice skates</a>. By 2009–2010, its ninth season, it was attracting more than 100,000 skaters a year. While availability of the rink depends on the weather, it also has a state-of-the-art chiller system that can maintain the ice in the event of unseasonably warm weather. Thus, temperature is not the only factor involved in decisions to close the rink. In his review of the plaza and rink, Kamin gave it two stars (out of a possible four), called the structure "solid, though unremarkable", and praised its uses throughout the year.

When the rink is closed, its surface becomes a 150-seat cafe that complements the 300-seat indoor <a href="Park%20Grill">Park Grill</a> dining facility. Street level features such as McCormick Tribune Plaza are linked to elevated features such as "Cloud Gate" and AT&T Plaza, which are atop the Park Grill Restaurant and can be reached via <a href="balustrade">balustrade</a>d stairs.

Through 2006 and 2007, the McCormick Tribune Ice Rink was one of several operated by the Chicago Park District. Since then, although the Chicago Park District still operates ten public ice skating rinks, the Millennium Park ice rink is operated by a division of the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs, itself a Department of the City of Chicago Government.

McCormick Tribune Ice Rink is generally open for skating afternoons and evenings seven days a week, with longer hours on weekends. However, it is occasionally closed for private events. Skating is free and skate rental is available. Except for its first year, the rink has been scheduled to be open from mid-November until mid-March, weather permitting. For the 2009–10 winter season, the rink was scheduled to be open from November 20, 2009 to March 14, 2010, with abbreviated holiday schedules on <a href="Thanksgiving%20%28United%20States%29">Thanksgiving</a>, <a href="Christmas%20Eve">Christmas Eve</a>, <a href="Christmas%20Day">Christmas Day</a> and <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Eve">New Year's Eve</a>. Skating is accompanied by <a href="loudspeaker">loudspeaker</a> music, which is mostly seasonal music during the holidays.

Rink attendance is heavier on the weekends and other times when school is not in session. Romantic holidays such as Christmas Eve and <a href="Valentine%27s%20Day">Valentine's Day</a> are also quite crowded. The ice rink is a popular <a href="people%20watching">people watching</a> location during the winter months; many view events at the McCormick Tribune Plaza from AT&T Plaza, above and to the east. The ice skating rink has become so popular that when the weather was too warm for the rink's opening in November 2005, the story became international news. The book "1,000 Places to See in the U.S.A. & Canada Before You Die" suggests a visit to McCormick Tribune Plaza during the skating season, and describes Millennium Park as a renowned attraction.

There are days when themed skating is encouraged. <a href="Santa">Santa</a> attire was encouraged on Saturday, December 13, 2008, and <a href="zombie">zombie</a> attire was encouraged the next day, as part of an attempt to set a <a href="Guinness%20World%20Records">Guinness World Record</a> for number of zombies on ice. The rink also serves as a host to the annual Chicago Winter Dance Festival; during the festival there is a month of free skating instruction and demonstration at the rink, and there is free dance instructions behind the glass doors of the <a href="Jay%20Pritzker%20Pavilion">Jay Pritzker Pavilion</a> stage.

During much of the offseason <a href="Al%20fresco%20dining">alfresco</a> dining is available in a 150-seat <a href="Coffeehouse">cafe</a> set up on the ice rink, in what is then referred to as the Park Grill Plaza. This outdoor dining experience is associated with the <a href="Park%20Grill">Park Grill Restaurant</a> and the Park Grill Cafe, which are both located under the "Cloud Gate" on AT&T Plaza. Architecture critic Blair Kamin compares the in-park eating options availed at the Park Grill with New York's former <a href="Tavern%20on%20the%20Green">Tavern on the Green</a> and Chicago's <a href="Cafe%20Brauer">Cafe Brauer</a>. The Park Grill Plaza is the largest outdoor dining venue in Chicago, and hosts a variety of events, including a benefit called "Chefs on the Grill" in which guests interact with invited chefs who are competing to produce the best dish. <a href="Wine%20tasting">Wine tasting</a>s are also hosted there, and during the summer, the Park Grill Plaza hosts musical performances on Thursdays. During the skating season, there are rinkside tables and the Park Grill Cafe offers take out and to-go service. Outdoor dining service begins in May.

McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink is one of two features in the park to include accessible restrooms; the other is <a href="Jay%20Pritzker%20Pavilion">Jay Pritzker Pavilion</a>. The restrooms are located adjacent to the Park Grill. Although McCormick Plaza is a winter focal point, the park's restroom facilities at this feature are not heated for winter use.

According to "<a href="Fodor%27s">Fodor's</a>", the restaurant is known for a view that makes up for unimpressive service. However, <a href="Citysearch">Citysearch</a> speaks positively about the service. <a href="Metromix">Metromix</a>, "Fodor's" and "<a href="Frommer%27s">Frommer's</a>" all laud the location of the restaurant, which serves <a href="New%20American%20cuisine">New American cuisine</a>.

General aviation in the United Kingdom

General aviation in the United Kingdom has been defined as a <a href="civil%20aviation">civil aircraft operation</a> other than a <a href="Airline">commercial air transport</a> flight operating to a schedule or <a href="military%20aviation">military aviation</a>. Although the <a href="International%20Civil%20Aviation%20Organization">International Civil Aviation Organization</a> (ICAO) excludes any form of remunerated aviation from its definition, some commercial operations are often included within the scope of <a href="general%20aviation">general aviation</a> (GA) in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">UK</a>. The sector operates <a href="business%20jet">business jet</a>s, <a href="rotorcraft">rotorcraft</a>, <a href="Reciprocating%20engine">piston</a> and <a href="jet-engine">jet-engine</a>d <a href="fixed-wing%20aircraft">fixed-wing aircraft</a>, <a href="Glider%20aircraft">gliders</a> of all descriptions, and <a href="Aerostat">lighter than air</a> craft. Public transport operations include business (or corporate) aviation and <a href="air%20taxi">air taxi</a> services, and account for nearly half of the economic contribution made by the sector. Other commercial GA activities are aerial work, such as <a href="Aerial%20survey">surveying</a> and <a href="Air%20Ambulances%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">air ambulances</a>, and <a href="flight%20training">flight training</a>, which plays an important role in the supply of pilots to the commercial air transport (CAT) industry. <a href="Private%20aviation">Private flying</a> is conducted for personal transport and recreation. It includes a strong vintage aircraft movement, and encompasses a range of <a href="air%20sports">air sports</a>, such as racing, <a href="aerobatics">aerobatics</a>, and <a href="parachuting">parachuting</a>, at which British teams and individuals have succeeded in international competition.

Of the 21,000 civil aircraft registered in the UK, 96 per cent are engaged in GA operations, and annually the GA fleet accounts for between 1.25 and 1.35 million hours flown. The single most common class of aircraft is the fixed-wing <a href="light%20aircraft">light aircraft</a> associated with traditional GA, but the main area of growth over the last 20 years has been in the use of more affordable aircraft, such as <a href="Ultralight%20aviation">microlights</a>, <a href="Homebuilt%20aircraft">amateur built</a> aeroplanes, and smaller <a href="helicopters">helicopters</a>. There are 28,000 <a href="Private%20Pilot%20Licence">Private Pilot Licence</a> holders, and 10,000 <a href="Gliding%23Badges">certified glider pilots</a>. Some of the 19,000 pilots who hold professional licences are also engaged in GA activities. Although GA operates from more than 1,800 <a href="aerodrome">aerodrome</a>s and landing sites, ranging in size from large <a href="regional%20airport">regional airport</a>s to farm strips, over 80 per cent of GA activity is conducted at 134 of the larger aerodromes. The GA industry, which is around 7 per cent the size of its CAT cousin, employs 12,000 people, and contributes £1.4 billion to the UK economy.

GA is regulated by the <a href="Civil%20Aviation%20Authority%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Civil Aviation Authority</a> (CAA), although regulatory powers are being increasingly transferred to the <a href="European%20Aviation%20Safety%20Agency">European Aviation Safety Agency</a> (EASA). The main focus is on standards of <a href="airworthiness">airworthiness</a> and <a href="Pilot%20licensing%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">pilot licensing</a>, and the objective is to promote high standards of safety. At the lighter end of the GA spectrum some regulatory authority is devolved to representative bodies, and <a href="gliding">gliding</a> is in transition from a self-regulatory model to more formal governance by EASA. <a href="Airspace">Airspace</a> regulation necessary to protect an increasing number of CAT operations has reduced the area in which GA flights can be freely conducted. The growth in CAT is also making access to larger airports more difficult for the GA sector, and smaller aerodromes are vulnerable to closure and re-development for more profitable uses. The UK <a href="Town%20and%20country%20planning%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">planning system</a> has no remit to consider the national significance of GA public transport operations, and generally does not favour the development of smaller aerodromes catering to the GA market. The planning process has become a mechanism for addressing local aerodrome-related environmental issues which, particularly regarding noise, are the main subjects of public criticism levelled at GA.

The <a href="International%20Civil%20Aviation%20Organization">International Civil Aviation Organization</a> (ICAO) defines <a href="general%20aviation">general aviation</a> (GA) as "an aircraft operation other than a commercial air transport operation or an aerial work operation." It defines <a href="Airline">commercial air transport</a> (CAT) as "an aircraft operation involving the transport of passengers, cargo or mail for remuneration or hire", and aerial work as "an aircraft operation in which an aircraft is used for specialized services such as agriculture, construction, photography, surveying, observation and patrol, search and rescue, aerial advertisement, etc."

Organisations in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> (UK) describe GA in less restrictive terms that include elements of <a href="commercial%20aviation">commercial aviation</a>. The <a href="BBGA">British Business and General Aviation Association</a> interprets it to be "all aeroplane and helicopter flying except that performed by the major airlines and the Armed Services". The General Aviation Awareness Council applies the description "all Civil Aviation operations other than scheduled air services and non-scheduled air transport operations for remuneration or hire". For the purposes of a strategic review of GA in the UK, the <a href="Civil%20Aviation%20Authority%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Civil Aviation Authority</a> (CAA) defined the scope of GA as "a civil aircraft operation other than a commercial air transport flight operating to a schedule", and considered it necessary to depart from the ICAO definition and include aerial work and minor CAT operations.

The first <a href="aerodrome">aerodrome</a> in the UK was established by the <a href="Royal%20Aero%20Club">Aero Club</a> at Muswell Manor on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Sheppey">Isle of Sheppey</a>, and in May 1909 it was the venue of the first flight conducted in the country by a British <a href="Aviator">pilot</a>, <a href="John%20Moore-Brabazon%2C%201st%20Baron%20Brabazon%20of%20Tara">John Moore-Brabazon</a>. In 1910 the Aero Club was granted the Royal prefix, took responsibility for controlling all <a href="Private%20aviation">private flying</a> in the UK, and started issuing the first British pilot licences. The introduction of the <a href="de%20Havilland%20DH.60%20Moth">de Havilland DH.60 Moth</a> in 1925 revolutionised light aviation, and the Royal Aero Club, recognising the "vital necessity of promoting civil flying", formed the Light Aeroplane Club scheme. Between 1925 and 1939 around 60 <a href="flying%20club">flying club</a>s were started, and more than 5,000 pilots were trained.

During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> civil aerodromes were taken over for military use, existing military airfields were expanded, and new ones were built. This resulted in a significant inventory of facilities becoming available after the war. Pre-war civil aerodromes, for example <a href="Sywell%20Aerodrome">Sywell</a>, were returned to civilian use. Surplus military airfields were closed, and in some cases, for example <a href="Beccles%20Airport">Beccles</a>, subsequently re-opened as civil aerodromes. The Ministry of Civil Aviation was created to regulate all <a href="civil%20aviation">civil aviation</a> in the UK, and this task remained the responsibility of government departments until the establishment of the independent CAA in 1972.

With an expanded infrastructure in place, GA became established after the war when manufacturers such as <a href="Cessna">Cessna</a> and <a href="Piper%20Aircraft">Piper</a> introduced <a href="light%20aircraft">light aircraft</a> designed for the private market. The <a href="Cessna%20172">Cessna 172</a>, developed from the late 1940s <a href="Cessna%20170">Cessna 170</a>, was introduced in 1956, and became the world's best selling single-engine aeroplane. Single <a href="Reciprocating%20engine">piston</a>-engine aircraft are still the most common class of aircraft in the UK GA fleet. The development of the <a href="Rogallo%20wing">Rogallo wing</a> in the 1950s fostered the <a href="History%20of%20hang%20gliding">development of hang-gliding</a> during the 1960s and 1970s. The 1960s also saw experiments with motorised <a href="Hang%20gliding">hang gliders</a>, but it was not until the 1970s that this blend of technologies started to mature, resulting in the birth of the <a href="Ultralight%20aviation">microlight</a> movement. Another milestone in the development of GA was the 1964 introduction of the <a href="Learjet%2023">Learjet 23</a>. Although it was not the first <a href="business%20jet">business jet</a>, it popularised corporate aviation, and established the personal jet as a "whole new class of aircraft".

The GA sector operates a range of aircraft, including <a href="Balloon%20%28aircraft%29">balloons</a> and <a href="airship">airship</a>s, <a href="Glider%20aircraft">gliders</a>, <a href="hang%20glider">hang glider</a>s, <a href="Paragliding">paragliders</a>, <a href="microlight">microlight</a>s, <a href="Autogyro">gyrocopters</a>, <a href="helicopters">helicopters</a>, <a href="Homebuilt%20aircraft">amateur built</a> and mass-produced <a href="light%20aircraft">light aircraft</a>, <a href="Warbird">ex-military aircraft</a>, and <a href="business%20jet">business jet</a>s. Flights can be broadly categorised as public transport, aerial work, and private flying, the first two of which are commercial activities.

Commercial operations are remunerated activities which fall within the ICAO definition of CAT. Some are, however, closely aligned to, and considered part of, the GA sector. Public transport operations are non-scheduled, on-demand services flying between points specified by the customer, providing a more flexible service than <a href="airline">airline</a> travel. <a href="Air%20taxi">Air taxi</a> operations offer charter services for third parties, and business or corporate aviation uses company-owned aircraft to transport employees and clients. Aircraft used in these operations include business jets, helicopters, and twin piston-engine aeroplanes carrying between six and ten people. An example of this type of operation is the transport by helicopter of spectators to the British <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> grand prix at <a href="Silverstone%20Circuit">Silverstone</a>. This involves so many flights that, according to Cranfield Aviation Services, on race day the heliport is temporarily the world's busiest airport. Aerial work is a small but important component of the commercial GA sector, characterised in its simplest form as remunerated non-transport activities, such as <a href="Aerial%20survey">surveying</a>, <a href="Aerial%20application">crop spraying</a>, and emergency services work (<a href="Air%20Ambulances%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">air ambulance</a> and <a href="Police%20aviation%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">police</a>).

Flying schools are commercial businesses engaged in the <a href="Flight%20training">training of pilots</a>, both for recreational purposes and for those intending to fly professionally. They make widespread use of <a href="Fixed-wing%20aircraft">fixed-wing</a> light aircraft associated with traditional GA, not only for flying lessons but also as club aircraft rented out to qualified pilots for recreational flights. School-owned aircraft account for a significant amount of GA activity, both in terms of hours flown and aircraft movements. The pilot training element is regarded by the GA community as a key benefit that is critical to the supply of pilots for the airline industry. It is claimed by the General Aviation Awareness Council that 60–70 per cent of professional pilots have self-financed their flight training at GA schools, and one UK airline operator has stated that the industry must rely on 70–80 per cent of new pilots coming from the GA sector. The CAA estimates that between 1996 and 2006 the number of new professional pilots following the unsponsored training route rose from 48 per cent to 59 per cent. The counter argument to this claim is that pilots can be trained outside of the UK, and that the airline industry is not therefore dependent on a healthy GA sector in the UK for its supply of pilots. The CAA concludes that a severe reduction in GA would give "some merit to the argument that pilot recruitment would be threatened", but that the data on flying hours "does not support such a gloomy outlook." Of course, reliance on other countries for pilot training means that the UK foregoes the economic benefit of the training activity.

Private flying can be for both recreational purposes and personal transport, using aircraft that are owned individually, collectively as part of a syndicate, or rented from a flying club. A survey of pilots conducted between 2001 and 2002 indicated that the most common purposes of recreational flights were local flights near the base aerodrome, visits to other aerodromes, and day trips away. Half of all flights landed at the same aerodrome they departed from, and only 9 per cent involved an overnight stay away from home.

Private flying is most associated with the traditional form of factory-produced two and four-seater, single piston-engine training and touring aircraft. Examples of these are the <a href="Cessna%20152">Cessna 152</a>, Cessna 172, and <a href="Piper%20Cherokee">Piper PA28 Cherokee</a>, all with their origins in the 1950s, and the more modern designs of <a href="Cirrus%20Design">Cirrus</a>. The average cost per hour to fly such aircraft has been estimated to be £133, compared to an estimated £77 per hour for gliders, and a reported £35 per hour for microlights. Recent trends have seen an increase in the use of microlights, and also in recreational helicopter flying following the introduction of smaller and cheaper machines such as the <a href="Robinson%20R22">Robinson R22</a> and <a href="Robinson%20R44">R44</a>. Another growth area in private flying in recent years has been in the use of amateur built aircraft, such as the <a href="Van%27s%20Aircraft%20RV-4">Van's Aircraft RV-4</a> and the <a href="Europa%20Aircraft">Europa</a>.

There is a strong vintage aircraft movement in the UK, with two-thirds of the 500 registered historic aircraft active. These cover the whole spectrum of civil and military aviation, examples being the <a href="de%20Havilland%20Dragon%20Rapide">de Havilland Dragon Rapide</a> airliner of the 1930s, and the <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> (WWII) <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Spitfire</a> fighter. There are many post-WWII aircraft which could also be considered historic under a looser definition, including for example 60 ex-military jets such as the <a href="Hawker%20Hunter">Hawker Hunter</a>. Historic aircraft are regular exhibits at <a href="Airshow">air displays</a>, which are claimed to be the second most popular spectator activity after football in the UK.

<a href="Gliding%20competitions">Competitive gliding</a> in the UK takes place between May and September. Regionals are local competitions, organised and run by one of the bigger gliding clubs in the region, and represent the entry level to glider racing. Races are handicapped according to glider performance, and normally take place over nine days. Success in the regionals allows pilots to progress to the nationals, where there are five <a href="Glider%20Competition%20Classes">classes</a> of competition. These are based on glider performance, the lowest being club class, and then progressing through standard (maximum <a href="wingspan">wingspan</a>, and <a href="Flap%20%28aircraft%29">flaps</a> not permitted), (as standard, but flaps are permitted), (maximum wingspan), and finally open-class (no restrictions). Success at national level can lead to a place in the national team and competition at international level. In 2007 the British gliding team was ranked number one, and British pilots took two women's <a href="World%20Gliding%20Championships">world championships</a> and the open class <a href="European%20Gliding%20Championships">European championship</a>.

<a href="Handicapping">Handicapped</a> <a href="air%20racing">air racing</a> is open to any propeller-driven aircraft capable of maintaining a minimum speed of per hour in level flight. Races are a case of "fly low, fly fast, turn left", consisting of 4–5 laps round a 20–25 mile (32–40 km) circuit. Faster aircraft are handicapped by starting after slower aircraft, the intention being that the race concludes with all aircraft diving for the finish line together. There are up to 16 races per year, conducted at airfields in the UK, <a href="France">France</a> and the <a href="Channel%20Islands">Channel Islands</a>, for prizes that include the <a href="Schneider%20Trophy">Schneider Trophy</a> and <a href="King%27s%20Cup%20Race">King's Cup</a>, and the season culminates with the British Air Racing and European Air Racing Championships.
<a href="Competition%20aerobatics">Aerobatic competitions</a> take place for both powered aircraft and gliders, with up to 30 events each year in the UK and <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a>. Starting at the Beginner level, pilots can move up to Standard (powered aircraft) or Sports (glider) levels, and then on to Intermediate, Advanced, and finally Unlimited classes. Each step up requires a wider repertoire of <a href="Aerobatics">aerobatic</a> figures and progressively more performance from the aircraft. National championships are awarded annually at Standard/Sports, Intermediate, Advanced (powered aircraft only), and Unlimited levels, and pilots who have reached Advanced and Unlimited levels are eligible for selection to represent the UK in international competition.

<a href="Parachuting">Parachute</a> competitions are held at club, regional, national and international levels, and include the disciplines of <a href="accuracy%20landing">accuracy landing</a>s, <a href="Freefall%20style">freefall gymnastics</a>, <a href="formation%20skydiving">formation skydiving</a>, <a href="canopy%20formation">canopy formation</a>, <a href="Freestyle%20skydiving">freestyle</a> and <a href="freeflying">freeflying</a>, and <a href="skysurfing">skysurfing</a>. British teams consistently win medals in canopy formation world championships, and a British team took the 2006 world championship in women's 4-way formation skydiving.

"Aerodrome" is a collective term for any location from which flying operations take place, although more specific terminology can be used to characterise its purpose. The CAA strategic review of GA applies the term "<a href="airport">airport</a>" to locations which predominantly support large scale commercial operations, and "airfield" to locations which predominantly support GA operations. The "General Aviation Small Aerodrome Research Study" (GASAR) analysed 687 aerodromes in <a href="England">England</a> which come under the scope of GA, classifying 374 into six types. These range in size from regional airports to the smallest farm strip, although 84 per cent of GA flights operate from 134 of the larger aerodromes in the first four categories.

The factors used in determining how an individual aerodrome is categorised by the GASAR study are based broadly on size and facilities. The six types of aerodrome are described, in size order, as: regional airports (e.g. <a href="East%20Midlands%20Airport">East Midlands</a>); major GA airports (e.g. <a href="Oxford%20Airport">Oxford</a>); developed GA airfields (e.g. <a href="Andrewsfield%20aerodrome">Andrewsfield</a>); basic GA airfields (e.g. <a href="Rufforth">Rufforth</a>); developed airstrips (e.g. <a href="Tilstock%20Airfield">Tilstock</a>); and basic airstrips (e.g. Chilbolton in Hampshire). The actual criteria used to categorise aerodromes were complex, using 28 different parameters, backed up with a peer review by experienced GA pilots.
Airports generally have long, fully lit, hard-surfaced runways, full <a href="air%20traffic%20control">air traffic control</a>, and <a href="Radio%20navigation">navigation</a> and <a href="Instrument%20approach">landing</a> aids. They are usually located on urban fringes, support commercial and business operations, and often exclude certain types of light aircraft. At the more rurally located airfields, the lighter end of aviation, such as microlight and gliding activities, becomes increasingly prevalent, and there are few or no commercial operations other than flying schools. At this level runways are generally shorter, and grass surfaces are increasingly common. Navigation aids are increasingly scarce, being more basic where they are available, and informal ground to air radio communication replaces air traffic control. The smallest airfields are too small to feature on general purpose <a href="Ordnance%20Survey">Ordnance Survey</a> (OS) maps, and lack basic facilities such as fuel and maintenance. The majority of airstrips are basically single short grass runways with no supporting facilities, although the presence of a hangar is not uncommon at the larger examples. They do not feature on OS maps, and are owned by private clubs or, more commonly, individuals.

Most aerodromes used for public transport operations are required to be licensed by the CAA. To be granted a licence an aerodrome operator must satisfy the CAA that: the physical conditions at the aerodrome, and its environs, are acceptable; the scale of equipment, and facilities provided, are adequate for the flying activities which are expected to take place; an effective safety management system is in place; and that staff are competent and, where necessary, suitably qualified. Aerodromes classified as developed GA airfields or larger by the GASAR study are, with few exceptions, licensed. Only two basic GA airfields, <a href="Silverstone%20Heliport">Silverstone</a> and <a href="Duxford%20Aerodrome">Duxford</a>, are licensed, and all airstrips are unlicensed. The Light Aviation Airports Study Group, a joint CAA-industry initiative, was established in 2005 to review the regulation of light aviation aerodromes. A particular focus of this group was a review of the restrictions placed on unlicensed aerodromes. The group concluded that the requirement for public transport operations to be conducted only from licensed aerodromes should be further reviewed in the context of corresponding international and European requirements. It also recommended that restrictions on flight training at unlicensed aerodromes should be lifted, and this was permitted from April 2010

There are an estimated 27,000 civil aircraft registered in the UK, 96 per cent of which are engaged in GA activities. In 2005 the GA fleet comprised 9,000 fixed-wing aircraft, 4,100 microlights, 1,300 helicopters, 1,800 airships/balloons, 2,500 gliders and some 7,000 hang gliders. Estimates put the number of foreign-registered GA aircraft based in the UK at 900.

The number of pilots licensed by the CAA to fly powered aircraft in 2005 was 47,000, of whom 28,000 held a <a href="Private%20Pilot%20Licence">Private Pilot Licence</a>. The remainder held professional pilot licences, either a <a href="Commercial%20Pilot%20Licence">Commercial Pilot Licence</a> or an <a href="Airline%20Transport%20Pilot%20Licence">Airline Transport Pilot Licence</a>, although not all of these would be engaged in GA activities. In addition, there are 10,000 active glider pilots, and estimates put the membership of aviation-related sport and recreational associations at 36,000.

The number of aerodromes that support GA in the UK is difficult to establish with certainty. "Pooleys 2008 United Kingdom Flight Guide" lists 355, and the Airplan Flight Equipment "UK VFR Flight Guide 2008" lists nearly 500. Lockyears "Farm 'Strips' and Private Airfields Flight Guide" lists more than 300 landing sites. The GASAR study estimates 1,100 formal flying sites in England alone, a figure which includes 400 sites known to planning authorities but not included in flight guides. It estimates another 759 informal sites known only to land owners, customs, and members of the enthusiast group Air-Britain.

The sector was estimated to employ nearly 12,000 people and directly contribute £1.4 billion to the UK economy in 2005, making it roughly seven per cent of the size of the CAT industry. Nearly half of the economic contribution was generated by business aviation.

Most sectors of GA for which data are available have experienced growth in aircraft numbers and hours flown over the last two decades. The lighter end of the GA spectrum: microlights, amateur built, and airships and balloons, have in particular shown strong growth, although the last of these activities was severely curtailed during the <a href="2001%20United%20Kingdom%20foot-and-mouth%20crisis">foot-and-mouth outbreak</a> in 2001, when access to farmland was denied . After strong growth in the late 1980s, traditional flying has shown a slight decline recently, reflecting a move amongst recreational flyers towards microlight aircraft, and increased numbers of foreign-registered aircraft. Recreational helicopter usage has grown primarily due to the introduction of smaller and cheaper aircraft. Glider activity has remained relatively static, although there has been a gradual increase in the number of <a href="Motor%20glider">self-launching motor gliders</a>.

Business aviation has shown strong growth, although the numbers of aircraft on the UK register have declined. This reflects a shift away from <a href="turboprop">turboprop</a> aircraft towards foreign-registered business jets based in the UK, which are estimated to be growing in numbers. However, twin piston-engined aircraft numbers have declined significantly, reflecting pressures on the light air-taxi segment from increasingly flexible and cheaper scheduled services, and a more sophisticated corporate charter business. The amount of flight training conducted by UK schools has declined, largely at the hands of competition from foreign schools, which benefit from lower costs and better weather.

Since 1990 the total number of hours flown annually by the GA sector has remained in the range 1.25–1.35 million, the dominant sector being traditional GA flying, which accounts for 0.6 million per year. An overall increase in aircraft numbers combined with nil growth in hours flown has brought the annual average utilisation per aircraft down from 157 hours in 1984 to 103 hours in 2002. The decline in asset utilisation has led to speculation that the economic health of the GA industry is weakening, though the lack of data on profitability makes this difficult to confirm.

The objective of regulation is to "promote high standards of safety in all aspects of aviation", and this is the main area of interaction between the CAA and the GA sector. Efforts focus on assuring appropriate standards of <a href="airworthiness">airworthiness</a>, <a href="Pilot%20licensing%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">pilot qualification</a>, the rules for the movement of aircraft, and equipment to be carried. The CAA was established as the primary regulatory body for all aviation in the UK in 1972. In 1991 it started working within the <a href="Joint%20Aviation%20Authorities">Joint Aviation Authorities</a> (JAA) framework to implement agreed common standards, known as the Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR), throughout the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> (EU). In 2003 this was taken a step further when the <a href="European%20Aviation%20Safety%20Agency">European Aviation Safety Agency</a> (EASA) was established as the central EU regulator, taking over responsibility for legislating airworthiness and environmental regulation from the national authorities. The CAA acts as an agency of EASA on these issues, retaining its original regulatory powers in areas not yet transferred to EASA. Proposed developments seek to establish EASA as the single authority throughout the EU, taking over from individual member states the power to regulate all aviation other than that specifically excluded from the scope of EASA.

Within this framework certain sectors of GA are governed on a devolved basis. In all cases the CAA/EASA retains responsibility for safety regulation, but representative bodies, particularly of sectors that are not included in the scope of EASA, are granted greater oversight of their activities. The majority of microlight aircraft are regulated by the <a href="British%20Microlight%20Aircraft%20Association">British Microlight Aircraft Association (BMAA)</a>, although a significant number are regulated by the <a href="Light%20Aircraft%20Association">Light Aircraft Association</a> (LAA), formerly known as the Popular Flying Association. The LAA is the primary regulator for amateur built aircraft, as well as vintage and classic aircraft. Parachuting is governed by the <a href="British%20Parachute%20Association">British Parachute Association</a>, although the aircraft used in this activity are generally CAA-regulated. Balloon and airship flying is overseen by the British Balloon and Airship Club. The UK-specific National Private Pilot Licence (NPPL) is administered by the National Pilots Licensing Group Ltd., supported by the LAA, the <a href="Aircraft%20Owners%20and%20Pilots%20Association">Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association</a> UK, the <a href="British%20Gliding%20Association">British Gliding Association</a>, and the British Microlight Aircraft Association. Separate from these devolved groups, gliding in the UK is self-regulated. The British Gliding Association was until recently responsible for glider airworthiness, now formally regulated as a result of EASA legislation, and still retains control of pilot certification. Hang gliding and paragliding activities (i.e. foot-launched gliders) are governed by the British Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association.

Under CAA and EASA rules, all aircraft are required to meet certain standards of airworthiness to fly safely and legally. Aircraft that meet these standards are issued with a Certificate of Airworthiness. However, British-registered aircraft which are excluded from the scope of EASA, and which cannot satisfy the requirements for the issue of a Certificate of Airworthiness, may be issued with a Permit to Fly. This allows them to fly in UK airspace subject to certain limitations, for example being restricted to day-time flights under <a href="visual%20flight%20rules">visual flight rules</a> only. A number of organisations (e.g. the British Microlight Aircraft Association and the
<a href="Light%20Aircraft%20Association">Light Aircraft Association</a>) have obtained a standing over-flight permission for Permit
to Fly aircraft within their area of interest with some European countries, notably
France. Permits are typically issued to vintage and historic aircraft, amateur built aircraft, and microlights.

The pilot qualification most relevant to GA is the Private Pilot Licence (PPL), which permits the holder to fly for recreational purposes without remuneration. In addition to the European-wide Joint Aviation Regulations Flight Crew Licensing (JAR-FCL) standard, the CAA also issues UK-specific national licences. In the absence of European standards for gyroplane, balloon, and airship pilots, the CAA licenses these according to the original UK PPL standard. As a response to the perception that JAR pilot licensing standards are excessively bureaucratic and expensive for the purposes of recreational pilots, the <a href="National%20Private%20Pilot%20Licence">National Private Pilot Licence</a> (NPPL) was introduced in 2002. The NPPL is easier to obtain than the JAR-FCL licence, has less stringent medical requirements, is more restrictive in the privileges it grants, and is valid only for flights in British-registered aircraft flying in UK and French airspace. Although there are plans to bring glider pilot licensing within the regulatory framework of EASA, the gliding sector is currently self-regulating in this respect. The British Gliding Association is responsible for defining the standards of initial training, and certifying, via a badge system, pilots who meet those standards. Pilots working in sectors of GA that are commercial operations, such as aerial work and business aviation, are required to hold a professional pilot licence which, at a minimum, is the Commercial Pilot Licence.

Between 1995 and 2004 there were 2,630 accidents involving GA aircraft, of which 139 were fatal, resulting in the loss of 317 lives. The majority of accidents involved small fixed-wing aircraft engaged in private flights, and analysis attributes the most common causes of these to: flight handling skills; poor judgement or <a href="airmanship">airmanship</a>; lack of training or experience; and omission of, or inappropriate, action.

There were 27 fatal accidents involving GA aircraft in 2007, resulting in the loss of 48 lives. These compare with 16 accidents claiming a total of 19 lives the previous year, and although the 2007 statistics are higher than average, they are not exceptional.

The growth in Commercial Air Transport (CAT) has eroded the operational freedom of GA, both in the air and on the ground at larger airports. Difficulty with access to larger airports is compounded by a decline in the number of aerodromes generally, and existing sites are often threatened with closure and re-development for more profitable uses. The UK <a href="Town%20and%20country%20planning%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">planning system</a> is designed to focus on local issues, and consideration of the national impact of GA operations is not within its remit. This makes aerodrome development difficult, often subjecting those that successfully negotiate the process to restrictions in use.

<a href="Airspace">Airspace</a> is shared by CAT, <a href="Military%20aviation">military</a> and GA users. It is divided into <a href="controlled%20airspace">controlled airspace</a>, in which aircraft must always be under the control of an <a href="air%20traffic%20controller">air traffic controller</a>, and <a href="uncontrolled%20airspace">uncontrolled airspace</a>, in which aircraft can operate autonomously. Although GA flights can under certain conditions enter controlled airspace, they operate mainly outside of it.

Controlled airspace is essential for the provision of a known air traffic environment necessary for the safe operation of CAT. A CAA review found that "mixing [commercial] operations with other users is considered undesirable, even untenable" by commercial operators. However this position has resulted in extensive Class A controlled airspace with complex boundaries, including some running down to the ground, prohibiting VFR access to airspace, resulting in high numbers of GA flights operating close to the borders of controlled airspace who could not get formal receipt of an air traffic service. Coupled with pilot navigation errors, hundreds of airspace infringements have been recorded every year.

Increases in the number of CAT operations, and in the number of airports they operate from, has resulted in a corresponding increase in Class A controlled airspace. Between 1997 and 2006 this area grew in size from 13 per cent of all airspace to 22 per cent nationally, and from 24 per cent to 43 per cent in airspace above England and <a href="Wales">Wales</a>, leading to a perception within the GA community of being squeezed out. There are particular problems for GA around large airports, where Class A controlled airspace extends to ground level. The concentration of commercial operations and high demand for GA in the South East of England have also resulted in extensive areas of Class A controlled airspace there, which serve to channel uncontrolled GA operations through high-collision-risk hot spots.

Regional airports, such as <a href="Edinburgh%20Airport">Edinburgh Airport</a>, have experienced strong growth in CAT operations in recent years. These operations are commercially and operationally incompatible with GA, and although there is no evidence of deliberate discrimination, the effect has been to discourage or exclude it. GA aircraft are being subject to significant increases in charges, including the imposition of handling fees in some cases. Some airports restrict or deny GA parking, and others limit or refuse certain GA activity. As a result, light GA aircraft are now rarely or never seen at large, busy international airports such as Heathrow, Stansted, Gatwick and Manchester.

In addition to this de facto loss of facilities, the number of aerodromes in the UK has been in decline over the last 50 years, as a result of increasing urbanisation and the closure of airfields built during WWII. Alternative and more profitable uses for land can also lead to existing aerodromes being threatened with closure, for example <a href="North%20Weald%20Airfield">North Weald</a>, or actually being closed, as happened to <a href="Ipswich%20Airport">Ipswich Airport</a>. and <a href="Bristol%20Filton%20Airport">Bristol Filton Airport</a>. Referring to the importance of a "functioning national network of GA airfields", especially where GA performs an air transport role, the CAA states that "there could be cause for concern if a significant further loss of airfields were to continue, especially if crucial nodes on the transport network were to be lost."

The <a href="planning%20permission">planning system</a> is critical to the viability and operation of GA aerodromes. With many cities lacking scheduled air transport services between them, and with GA access to commercial airports becoming increasingly difficult and expensive, a viable network of aerodromes supporting GA air transport operations is regarded as an important national issue. However, there is no unified national planning policy specific to GA aerodromes, and planning decisions relating to these are based on local issues that are not required to consider the national impact. Because aircraft are excluded from noise control legislation, the only recourse for people affected by aircraft noise is through the planning process, and this issue is the principal factor on which the majority of planning decisions relating to GA land use are made. GA is a specialist subject often unfamiliar to <a href="Local%20planning%20authority">Local Planning Authorities</a>, and most planning decisions relating to GA either refuse permission, or grant it with restrictive conditions. <a href="Little%20Gransden%20Airfield">Little Gransden</a> is just one example of a GA airfield required to comply with planning restrictions on the number of movements permitted, thereby inhibiting further development. Such restrictions, if poorly conceived, can make GA operations unviable or even unsafe.

Public opinion towards aviation generally is worsening, based on increasing <a href="Aviation%20and%20the%20environment">environmental concerns</a> relating to emissions and <a href="Aircraft%20noise">noise</a>, and private flying has been criticised by respondents to a government consultation on aircraft noise as a frivolous or selfish activity. In terms of environmental complaints and enquiries made to the CAA that relate specifically to GA, noise is "by far" the most common subject. Half of the 2,000 noise complaints made annually to the CAA concern GA operations, most of which relate to aerobatics, helicopters using private sites, air balloon incidents, parachute dropping, and alleged low flying.

Planning guidance on aircraft noise advises that "in some circumstances the public perceive general aircraft noise levels as more disturbing than similar levels around major airports." This is a result of the tonal characteristics of light aircraft engines and the activities they are engaged in, including: repetitive <a href="Airfield%20traffic%20pattern">circuit flying</a> at low-altitude near an aerodrome, during which aircraft are audible for long periods; slow climbing aircraft engaged in parachute drop or glider tug activities concentrated around the <a href="drop%20zone">drop zone</a> or aerodrome, also audible for long periods; erratic and repetitive engine noise from aircraft engaged in aerobatics; and piston-engines on full power in areas of low background noise, leading to the perception that such noise is more intrusive. In an attempt to alleviate these problems, the majority of aerodromes implement noise abatement procedures designed to route aircraft away from noise sensitive areas, and more than 50 are required by the government to provide consultative facilities in which local concerns can be raised with aerodrome operators.

Sonestown Covered Bridge

The Sonestown Covered Bridge is a <a href="Burr%20Truss">Burr arch truss</a> <a href="covered%20bridge">covered bridge</a> over <a href="Muncy%20Creek">Muncy Creek</a> in <a href="Davidson%20Township%2C%20Sullivan%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Davidson Township</a>, <a href="Sullivan%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Sullivan County</a>, in the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. Built c. 1850, the bridge is long, and was placed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> (NRHP) in 1980. The bridge is named for the nearby <a href="unincorporated%20area">unincorporated</a> <a href="village">village</a> of <a href="Sonestown">Sonestown</a> in Davidson Township, and is also known as the Davidson Covered Bridge. It was built to provide access to a <a href="gristmill">gristmill</a>, which operated until the early 20th century.

Pennsylvania had the first covered bridge in the United States and the most such bridges in the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries. In most places in the state they were a transition between stone and metal bridges, with the roof and sides protecting the wooden structure from weather. The Sonestown bridge is a Burr arch truss type, with a <a href="Structural%20engineering">load-bearing</a> <a href="arch">arch</a> sandwiching multiple vertical <a href="Truss%23King%20post%20truss">king posts</a>, for strength and rigidity. The bridge construction is cruder than the other two surviving covered bridges in Sullivan County, with each Burr arch formed from six straight beams set at angles instead of a smooth curve.

The bridge was repaired c. 1969, and after flood damage in 1996, 2005, and 2013. It was also restored in 2001. Despite the repairs and restoration, as of 2012 the bridge structure's sufficiency rating on the <a href="National%20Bridge%20Inventory">National Bridge Inventory</a> was only 19.0 percent and its condition was deemed "Structurally deficient" (the bridge was also closed in 2012, awaiting repair). It is the shortest covered bridge in the county and as of 2015 is still in use, with average daily traffic of 50 vehicles in 2010.

The covered bridge crosses Muncy Creek in Davidson Township on Champion Hill Road (Township Road 310), just east of <a href="U.S.%20Route%20220">U.S. Route 220</a>. The village of <a href="Sonestown">Sonestown</a> is north of the bridge on Route 220 and has given the Sonestown Covered Bridge its name. The bridge is also east of the village of <a href="Muncy%20Valley">Muncy Valley</a> along Route 220. Its official name on the NRHP is Sonestown Covered Bridge. It is also known as the Davidson Covered Bridge, for its township. Sullivan County is located in north central Pennsylvania, about northwest of <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> and east-northeast of <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>.
The area that became Davidson Township was first settled in 1806 and was incorporated as a township in 1833. Within the township, George Sones built a sawmill and founded the unincorporated village of Sonestown in 1843. All of these events occurred before Sullivan County was formed from part of <a href="Lycoming%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Lycoming County</a> on March 14, 1847. The bridge was built in 1850, and in the late 19th century Sonestown "boomed like crazy" as the lumber industry grew in Sullivan County. The village was then home to a plant that manufactured the staves for making barrels. It had a <a href="clothespin">clothespin</a> factory from 1903 to 1929 but lost almost all industry by the 1930s. As of 1996, Sonestown had a population of about 200, most of whom commuted to work in <a href="Muncy%2C%20Pennsylvania">Muncy</a>, <a href="Montoursville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Montoursville</a>, and <a href="Williamsport%2C%20Pennsylvania">Williamsport</a>. In 1996 the village had a few stores, an inn with a restaurant, and attracted tourists and hunters.

The first covered bridge in the United States was built in 1800 over the <a href="Schuylkill%20River">Schuylkill River</a> in Philadelphia. According to Susan M. Zacher, author of "The Covered Bridges of Pennsylvania: A Guide", the first covered bridges of the Burr arch truss design were also built in the state. Pennsylvania is estimated to have once had at least 1,500 covered bridges and is believed to have had the most in the country between 1830 and 1875. In 2001, Pennsylvania had more surviving historic covered bridges than any other state, with 221 remaining in 40 of its 67 counties.
Covered bridges were a transition between stone and metal bridges, the latter made of cast-iron or steel. In 19th-century Pennsylvania, lumber was an abundant resource for bridge construction, but wood did not last long when exposed to the elements. The roof and enclosed sides of covered bridges protected the structural elements, allowing some of these bridges to survive for well over a century. A Burr arch truss consists of a <a href="Structural%20engineering">load-bearing</a> <a href="arch">arch</a> sandwiching multiple <a href="Truss%23King%20post%20truss">king posts</a>, resulting in a stronger and more rigid structure than one made of either element alone. Although there were 30 covered bridges in Sullivan County in 1890, only five were left by 1954, and as of 2015 only three remain: <a href="Forksville%20Covered%20Bridge">Forksville</a>, <a href="Hillsgrove%20Covered%20Bridge">Hillsgrove</a>, and Sonestown.

All three Sullivan County covered bridges were built in or c. 1850 with Burr arch trusses. At the time of its construction, the Sonestown bridge was the fifth covered bridge in Sullivan County. The bridge crossed <a href="Muncy%20Creek">Muncy Creek</a> to provide access to Johnny Hazen's gristmill, which was also built in 1850. Although most sources do not list the builder of the Sonestown bridge, two newspaper articles on the remaining Sullivan County covered bridges reported that Sadler Rodgers had designed or possibly built it as well. Rogers, a native of <a href="Forksville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Forksville</a>, built both the Forksville and Hillsgrove bridges in 1850, when he was 18 years old.

On July 24, 1980, the Sonestown bridge was listed on the NRHP in a <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places%23Multiple%20Property%20Submission">Multiple Property Submission</a> of seven <a href="Covered%20Bridges%20of%20Bradford%2C%20Sullivan%20and%20Lycoming%20Counties">Covered Bridges of Bradford, Sullivan and Lycoming Counties</a>. The Sonestown bridge is also on the 2012 National Bridge Inventory (NBI), which lists the covered bridge as long, with a roadway wide, and a maximum load of . However, the maximum load posted beside the bridge itself is only . According to the NRHP, the bridge's "road surface width" is , which is only sufficient for a single lane of traffic.

According to the NRHP form, the Sonestown bridge "is of lighter construction than similar bridges in south-eastern Pennsylvania". The covered bridge rests on <a href="abutment">abutment</a>s of stone and mortar, which have been reinforced with concrete. The portals are flanked by <a href="wing%20wall">wing wall</a>s below the level of the road; these extend out from the abutments at an angle and "retain the soil of the approach embankment".
The bridge deck is made of wide boards laid perpendicular to the axis of the bridge, with two runners on top of the deck which run the length of the bridge. The Burr arches which support the bridge are cruder than those in the other two Sullivan County covered bridges; they are not smooth "continuous arcs, but several straight segments joined at an angle". The top of the Burr arch on the south (downstream) side of the bridge is noticeably lower than the top of the arch on the north (upstream) side.

Vertical boards cover the sides and portals of the bridge and are painted red. The bridge has a small window in the center of each side (it had no windows before the 2013 restoration), and openings between the <a href="eave">eave</a>s and the siding which run the length of the bridge on both sides. The gable roof is covered with wooden <a href="Shake%20%28shingle%29">shake shingles</a>. A sign listing the vertical clearance as is posted above each portal. The bridge has no steel reinforcements.

Attitudes towards covered bridges in Sullivan County changed considerably in the last half of the 20th century. Two of the five bridges that remained in 1954 were razed by 1970, when the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Pennsylvania Department of Transportation</a> considered tearing down the Forksville bridge (but renovated it because of its historic nature and appeal to tourists). The Hillsgrove Covered Bridge was added to the NRHP in 1973, and the two other bridges were added in 1980. The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission requires its approval for renovation work on NRHP bridges in the state, and forbids the destruction of these bridges.

In the 19th century the Sonestown Covered Bridge survived major floods on March 1, 1865 and June 1, 1889, that destroyed other bridges in the West Branch Susquehanna River valley. The latter flood was caused by the same storm system that caused the <a href="Johnstown%20Flood">Johnstown Flood</a>, which killed over 2,200 people. In 1885, the <a href="Williamsport%20and%20North%20Branch%20Railroad">Williamsport and North Branch Railroad</a> line along Muncy Creek reached Sonestown, passing just east of the bridge. The railroad carried lumber, coal, and passengers until it closed in 1938.

The covered bridge was built to provide access to a gristmill, and the 1915 state highway map of Sullivan County shows a mill just downstream of the bridge on the east bank of Muncy Creek. The 1941 map (using data from 1939) no longer shows a water-powered mill there, although it does show two buildings on the east bank of the creek, with one just upstream and one just downstream of the bridge. Both of these buildings had disappeared by 1999. The NRHP form states that the bridge had been recently repaired in 1969, and that additional maintenance work was needed. The repairs done at that time included replacing some of the siding panels, reinforcing the abutments with concrete, and "very minor addition of steel to the truss structure".

In January 1996, there was major flooding throughout Pennsylvania. A <a href="North%20American%20blizzard%20of%201996">blizzard</a> from January 6–8 produced up to of snow, which was followed on January 19–21 by more than of rain with temperatures as high as and winds up to . The rain and snowmelt caused flooding throughout Pennsylvania, and <a href="ice%20jam">ice jam</a>s made the flooding worse on many streams. In neighboring Lycoming County, flooding on <a href="Lycoming%20Creek">Lycoming Creek</a> in and near Williamsport killed six and caused millions of dollars in damage, and an ice jam on <a href="Plunketts%20Creek%20%28Loyalsock%20Creek%29">Plunketts Creek</a> destroyed a mid-19th century <a href="Plunketts%20Creek%20Bridge%20No.%203">stone arch bridge</a> which was also on the NRHP.
The pressure of the flood on the Sonestown Covered Bridge moved the center of the structure almost downstream. This and other major damage closed the bridge from January until late December, 1996. It was one of 69 publicly owned bridges in Pennsylvania destroyed or closed by the flooding. Sullivan County owns the bridge and paid for its repair, which was mandated by the state since it is listed on the NRHP. The original bid was for $93,000, and the repair was done by Lycoming Supply Inc. of Williamsport for $89,000 over 60 days between mid-November and Christmas. The bridge's closure caused a detour for those who normally used the bridge to reach their homes and businesses.

Even after the repair was completed, vehicles that were heavier or larger than the bridge's original limits could not use it. Since beer trucks could not cross it, deliveries to the <a href="American%20Legion">American Legion</a> Post southeast of the bridge were made with a hand cart instead. On November 12, 2000, a new "Veterans Memorial Bridge" just downstream of the covered bridge was dedicated. The new bridge is also part of Champion Hill Road (Township Road 310), and allows all vehicles to cross Muncy Creek.

According to NBI data, the covered bridge was restored in 2001. In September 2004, flooding from <a href="Hurricane%20Ivan">Hurricane Ivan</a> followed by heavy rains in April 2005 made a hole in one of the covered bridge's abutments and weakened a structural support. Repair work took six weeks and was done by mid-August 2005. August of that same year saw placement of <a href="riprap">riprap</a> and fill in the creek to further protect the abutments, with the work done by Rexer's Drilling and Concrete of <a href="Dushore%2C%20Pennsylvania">Dushore</a> for $9,250. Erosion in September 2004 had destroyed a house upstream of the bridge, so the Sullivan County Commissioners planned additional work to stabilize the creek bed and prevent further erosion damage. The work, on private property and requiring permission from the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Department%20of%20Environmental%20Protection">Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection</a>, was done in the summer of 2006.
The NRHP form describes the bridge's condition as "fair" in 1969 and "good" in 1980. Zacher's 1994 book and the Evans 2001 book also listed it as in "good" condition. Despite this and the repairs and restoration, the 2006 <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a> <a href="National%20Bridge%20Inventory">National Bridge Inventory</a> found the sufficiency rating of the bridge structure to be only 18.6 percent. It found that the bridge's foundations were stable for <a href="Bridge%20scour">scour</a> conditions (the potential for the stream washing them out), but that the railing "does not meet currently acceptable standards". Its overall condition was deemed "basically intolerable requiring high priority of corrective action", with an estimated cost to improve the bridge of $108,000.

In 1996 there was a tradition of decorating and lighting the Sonestown bridge for Christmas. The average daily traffic on the bridge was 50 vehicles in 2006. As of 2016, it was still used and was the only remaining covered bridge over Muncy Creek, although the Muncy Creek <a href="drainage%20basin">watershed</a> also had the <a href="Lairdsville%20Covered%20Bridge">Lairdsville Covered Bridge</a>, which spanned <a href="Little%20Muncy%20Creek">Little Muncy Creek</a> in Lycoming County. According to Zacher, the "Sullivan County bridges, because of their settings, are some of the most attractive in the state".

The bridge was damaged when Muncy Creek flooded from over of rainfall caused by <a href="Tropical%20Storm%20Lee%20%282011%29">Tropical Storm Lee</a> on September 7, 2011.

The following table is a comparison of published measurements of length, width and load recorded in different sources using different methods, as well as the name or names cited. The NBI measures bridge length between the "backwalls of abutments" or the pavement grooves at the opposite ends of the bridge. It defines the roadway width as "the most restrictive minimum distance between curbs or rails". The NRHP form was prepared by the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Historical%20and%20Museum%20Commission">Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission</a> (PHMC), which surveyed county engineers, historical and covered bridge societies, and others for all the covered bridges in the commonwealth. The Evans visited every covered bridge in Pennsylvania in 2001 and measured each bridge's length (portal to portal) and width (at the portal) for their book. The data in Zacher's book was based on a 1991 survey of all covered bridges in Pennsylvania by the PHMC and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, aided by local government and private agencies. The article uses primarily the NBI and NRHP data, as they are national programs.

Forksville Covered Bridge

The Forksville Covered Bridge is a <a href="Burr%20Truss">Burr arch truss</a> <a href="covered%20bridge">covered bridge</a> over <a href="Loyalsock%20Creek">Loyalsock Creek</a> in the borough of <a href="Forksville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Forksville</a>, <a href="Sullivan%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Sullivan County</a>, in the U.S. state of <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. It was built in 1850 and is in length. The bridge was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The Forksville bridge is named for the borough it is in, which in turn is named for its location at the <a href="confluence%20%28geography%29">confluence</a> or "forks" of the <a href="Little%20Loyalsock%20Creek">Little Loyalsock</a> and Loyalsock Creeks.

Pennsylvania had the first covered bridge in the United States and the most such bridges in both the 19th and 21st centuries. They were a transition between stone and metal bridges, with the roof and sides protecting the wooden structure from weather. The Forksville bridge is a Burr arch truss type, with a <a href="Structural%20engineering">load-bearing</a> <a href="arch">arch</a> sandwiching multiple vertical <a href="Truss%23King%20post%20truss">king posts</a>, for strength and rigidity. The building of the Forksville bridge was supervised by the 18-year-old <a href="Sadler%20Rogers">Sadler Rogers</a>, who used his hand-carved model of the structure. It served as the site of a <a href="stream%20gauge">stream gauge</a> from 1908 to 1913 and is still an official Pennsylvania state highway bridge. The United States <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Department of Transportation</a> <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a> uses it as the model of a covered bridge "classic <a href="gable">gable</a> roof", and it serves as the <a href="logo">logo</a> of a Pennsylvania insurance company.

The bridge was restored in 1970 and 2004 and is still in use, with average daily traffic of 224 vehicles in 2009. Despite the restorations, as of 2009 the bridge structure's sufficiency rating on the <a href="National%20Bridge%20Inventory">National Bridge Inventory</a> was only 17.7 percent and its condition was deemed "basically intolerable requiring high priority of corrective action". It is one of three remaining covered bridges in Sullivan County, and according to Susan M. Zacher's "The Covered Bridges of Pennsylvania: A Guide", its location "over the rocky Loyalsock Creek" is "one of the most attractive settings in the state."

The covered bridge is in the borough of Forksville on Bridge Street, a spur of State Route 4012, just west of <a href="Pennsylvania%20Route%20154">Pennsylvania Route 154</a>. It is about south of <a href="Pennsylvania%20Route%2087">Pennsylvania Route 87</a> and north of <a href="Worlds%20End%20State%20Park">Worlds End State Park</a> on PA 154. Forksville Covered Bridge is its official name on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Sullivan County is located in north central Pennsylvania, about 123 miles (198 km) northwest of <a href="Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania">Philadelphia</a> and 195 miles (314 km) east-northeast of <a href="Pittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania">Pittsburgh</a>.

The bridge is just upstream of the <a href="confluence%20%28geography%29">confluence</a> of the <a href="Little%20Loyalsock%20Creek">Little Loyalsock</a> and Loyalsock Creeks. This was known as the "forks of the Loyalsock" and gave <a href="Forks%20Township%2C%20Sullivan%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Forks Township</a> its name when the township was incorporated in 1833, while still part of <a href="Lycoming%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Lycoming County</a>. Sullivan County was formed from part of Lycoming County on March 14, 1847, and the bridge was built in 1850. The name of the bridge comes from the community of Forksville, which is on land first settled in 1794, was laid out as a village in 1854, and was incorporated as a borough from part of Forks Township on December 22, 1880.

The first covered bridge in the United States was built in 1800 over the <a href="Schuylkill%20River">Schuylkill River</a> in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, Pennsylvania. According to Zacher, the first covered bridges of the Burr arch truss design were also built in the state. Pennsylvania is estimated to have once had at least 1,500 covered bridges and is believed to have had the most in the country between 1830 and 1875. In 2001, Pennsylvania had more surviving historic covered bridges than any other state, with 221 remaining in 40 of its 67 counties.

Covered bridges were a transition between stone and metal bridges, the latter made of cast-iron or steel. In 19th-century Pennsylvania, lumber was an abundant resource for bridge construction, but did not last long when exposed to the elements. The roof and enclosed sides of covered bridges protected the structural elements, allowing some of these bridges to survive for well over a century. A Burr arch truss consists of a <a href="Structural%20engineering">load-bearing</a> <a href="arch">arch</a> sandwiching multiple <a href="Truss%23King%20post%20truss">king posts</a>, resulting in stronger and more rigid structure than one made of either element alone.

Although there were 30 covered bridges in Sullivan County in 1890, only five were left by 1954, and as of 2011 only three remain: Forksville, <a href="Hillsgrove%20Covered%20Bridge">Hillsgrove</a>, and <a href="Sonestown%20Covered%20Bridge">Sonestown</a>. All three are Burr arch truss covered bridges and were built in 1850. The Forksville Covered Bridge was built for Sullivan County by Sadler Rogers (or Rodgers), a native of Forksville who was only 18 at the time. He hand-carved a model of the bridge before work began and used it to supervise construction. Rogers built the Forksville and Hillsgrove bridges across Loyalsock Creek, with the latter about downstream of the former. Although most sources do not list the builder of the Sonestown bridge, a 1997 newspaper article on the remaining Sullivan County covered bridges reported that Rodgers had designed it too.
The Forksville Covered Bridge was added to the NRHP on , 1980, in a <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places%23Multiple%20Property%20Submission">Multiple Property Submission</a> of seven <a href="Covered%20Bridges%20of%20Bradford%2C%20Sullivan%20and%20Lycoming%20Counties">Covered Bridges of Bradford, Sullivan and Lycoming Counties</a>. The 2009 National Bridge Inventory (NBI) lists the covered bridge as long, with a roadway wide, and a maximum load of . According to the NRHP, the bridge's "road surface width" is , which is only sufficient for a single lane of traffic. As of 2011, each portal has a small sign reading "1850 Sadler Rogers" at the top, above a sign with the posted clearance height of , and a "No Trucks Allowed" sign hanging below these.

The covered bridge rests on the original stone <a href="abutment">abutment</a>s, which have since been reinforced with concrete. The bridge deck, which is now supported by steel beams, is made of "very narrow crosswise planks". Wheel guards on the deck separate the roadway from the pedestrian walkways on either side and protect the sides, which are covered with vertical planks almost to the <a href="eaves">eaves</a>. The bridge has long, narrow windows with wooden shutters: the south side has four windows, and the north side has three. An opening between the eaves and the siding runs the length of the bridge on both sides. The bridge is supported by a Burr arch truss of 16 panels, with wooden beams. The gable roof is <a href="sheet%20metal">sheet metal</a> and is used as the model illustration of a "classic gable roof" for a covered bridge by the <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20Transportation">U.S. Department of Transportation</a> <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a>'s <a href="Turner-Fairbank%20Highway%20Research%20Center">Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center</a>.

In the 19th century the Forksville Covered Bridge survived major floods on March 1, 1865, and June 1, 1889, that destroyed other bridges in the West Branch Susquehanna River valley. Between about 1870 and 1890, logging in the Loyalsock Creek watershed produced lumber rafts that floated beneath the bridge. These rafts, each containing 5,000–30,000 <a href="Board%20foot">board feet</a> (12–70 m) of lumber, were carried down the Loyalsock to its mouth at <a href="Montoursville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Montoursville</a>, and some continued on the West Branch Susquehanna River beyond. The rafts ended when the <a href="eastern%20hemlock">eastern hemlock</a> were all <a href="clearcutting">clearcut</a>.

From 1908 to 1913, there was a <a href="stream%20gauge">stream gauge</a> on the bridge. Twice a day, the creek height was read on a chain long on the bridge's upstream side, and <a href="Discharge%20%28hydrology%29">discharge</a> measurements were taken on the downstream side. At the time it served as a "single span, wooden, covered highway bridge". The bridge survived another major flood on November 16, 1926, when a dam broke upstream but was "badly damaged" by an <a href="ice%20jam">ice jam</a> on , 1959, in a flood that left blocks of ice weighing up to in the streets of Forksville.

The Forksville Covered Bridge was restored in 1970 with what the NRHP nomination form describes as "all kinds of odd repairs". The restoration work was completed by T. Corbin Lewis of <a href="Hillsgrove%20Township%2C%20Pennsylvania">Hillsgrove Township</a>, a retired electrical <a href="General%20contractor">contractor</a>, whose low bid of $48,000 was accepted over a <a href="Baltimore%2C%20Maryland">Baltimore, Maryland</a>, firm's $185,000 bid. The restoration was supervised by the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Pennsylvania Department of Transportation</a> (PennDOT), which owns and maintains the bridge. The repair involved minor work on the "steel floor beams and stringers", which had been added years before. An entirely new wooden deck was installed, with wheel guards (wooden <a href="curb%20%28road%29">curbs</a>) to channel vehicle traffic to the center and to protect the pedestrian walkways on the sides. Windows were cut in the bridge's sides for the first time, and steel girders were "added to support the bridge's understructure."
Attitudes towards covered bridges in Sullivan County changed considerably in the last half of the 20th century. Two of the five bridges remaining in 1954 were razed by 1970, when PennDOT considered tearing down the Forksville bridge too. It was renovated rather than razed because of its historic nature and appeal to tourists. The Forksville Covered Bridge was added to the NRHP in 1980, and the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Historical%20and%20Museum%20Commission">Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission</a> now forbids the destruction of any covered bridge on the NRHP in the state and has to approve any renovation work.

The NBI says the bridge was "reconstructed" in 2004 but does not give further details. The entire bridge has been reinforced with steel girders, including vertical beams. In 2006 the red bridge was repainted, which took about three weeks.

The bridge's condition was described as "good" in the 1980 NRHP form, Zacher's 1994 book, and the Evans' 2001 book. However, the 2009 <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a> National Bridge Inventory found the sufficiency rating of the bridge structure to be 17.7 percent. It found that the bridge's foundations were "determined to be stable for calculated <a href="Bridge%20scour">scour</a> conditions" but that the railing "does not meet currently acceptable standards". Its overall condition was deemed "basically intolerable requiring high priority of corrective action"; the 2006 NBI estimated the cost to improve the bridge at $463,000.
Today the Forksville Covered Bridge is heavily used, as it is the most direct and shortest route from PA 154, at the eastern end, to Forksville and its <a href="general%20store">general store</a>, which are at the western end. In 2000, Forksville had 147 residents. The posted speed limit is , and its average daily traffic was 224 vehicles in 2009. The bridge is used as the logo of the Farmers & Mechanics Mutual Insurance Company, which was founded in Sullivan County in 1877.

In addition to its utility, the bridge is appreciated for its history and beauty. In 1970 a long-time Forksville resident spoke of the bridge's connection to the past: "When you stand quiet on the bridge and the woods are still, you can almost hear the horses clomping over the wooden deck as they did in years gone by; you can almost see the youngsters who climbed the rafters of the bridge to 'skinny-dip' in the creek below". Zacher's 1994 "The Covered Bridges of Pennsylvania: A Guide" describes the bridge's location "over the rocky Loyalsock Creek" as "one of the most attractive settings in the state."

The following table is a comparison of published measurements of length, width and load recorded by four different sources using different methods, as well as the name cited for the bridge and its builder. The NBI measures bridge length between the "backwalls of abutments" or pavement grooves and the roadway width as "the most restrictive minimum distance between curbs or rails". The NRHP form was prepared by the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Historical%20and%20Museum%20Commission">Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission</a> (PHMC), which surveyed county engineers, historical and covered bridge societies, and others for all the covered bridges in the commonwealth. The Evans visited every covered bridge in Pennsylvania in 2001 and measured each bridge's length (portal to portal) and width (at the portal) for their book. The data in Zacher's book was based on a 1991 survey of all covered bridges in Pennsylvania by the PHMC and PennDOT, aided by local government and private agencies. The article uses primarily the NBI and NRHP data, as they are national programs.

Hillsgrove Covered Bridge

The Hillsgrove Covered Bridge is a <a href="Burr%20Truss">Burr arch truss</a> <a href="covered%20bridge">covered bridge</a> over <a href="Loyalsock%20Creek">Loyalsock Creek</a> in <a href="Hillsgrove%20Township%2C%20Sullivan%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Hillsgrove Township</a>, <a href="Sullivan%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Sullivan County</a>, in the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. It was built c. 1850 and is long. In 1973, it became the first covered bridge in the county to be placed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The bridge is named for the township and nearby <a href="Unincorporated%20area">unincorporated</a> <a href="village">village</a> of Hillsgrove, and is also known as Rinkers Covered Bridge for an adjoining farm.

Pennsylvania had the first covered bridge in the United States, and has had the most such bridges since the 19th century. They were a transition between stone and metal bridges, with the roof and sides protecting the wooden structure from the weather. The Hillsgrove bridge has <a href="Structural%20engineering">load-bearing</a> Burr <a href="arch">arch</a>es sandwiching multiple vertical <a href="Truss%23King%20post%20truss">king posts</a> on each side, for strength and rigidity. It was built by <a href="Sadler%20Rodgers">Sadler Rodgers</a>, who also constructed the nearby <a href="Forksville%20Covered%20Bridge">Forksville Covered Bridge</a> in the same year, with a similar design.

The Hillsgrove bridge is the longest of three covered bridges remaining in Sullivan County, and served as a landing site for lumber rafts on the creek between 1870 and 1890. Nineteenth-century regulations restricting speed, number of animals, and fire are still posted on the bridge. Restoration work was carried out in 1963, 1968, 2010, and again in 2012 after serious flood damage. The bridge is still in use, with average daily traffic of 54 vehicles in 2012. Despite these restorations, it had a "structurally deficient" rating in the 2012 <a href="National%20Bridge%20Inventory">National Bridge Inventory</a>, with a 16.5 percent structural sufficiency rating.

The covered bridge is in Hillsgrove Township on Covered Bridge Road (Township Road 357), which is north of <a href="Pennsylvania%20Route%2087">Pennsylvania Route 87</a> via <a href="Splash%20Dam">Splash Dam</a> Road (TR 359). The bridge crosses Loyalsock Creek northeast and upstream of the unincorporated village of Hillsgrove, and is just south of <a href="Elkland%20Township%2C%20Pennsylvania">Elkland Township</a>. Its official name on the NRHP is "Hillsgrove Covered Bridge". It is also known as Rinkers Covered Bridge for the Rinker farm, which is located at the east end of the bridge. Sullivan County is located in north central Pennsylvania, about northwest of <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> and east-northeast of <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>.

The village of Hillsgrove is where Daniel Ogden became the first settler in what is now Sullivan County, c. 1786. John Hill, who founded and named the village of Hill's Grove (later just Hillsgrove), came to the area in 1789 and bought Ogden's land about 1794. Sullivan County was formed from part of <a href="Lycoming%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Lycoming County</a> on March 14, 1847, and the bridge was built in 1850. The division of Lycoming County ran through <a href="Plunketts%20Creek%20Township%2C%20Pennsylvania">Plunketts Creek Township</a>, so there were initially townships of this name in each of the adjoining counties. To avoid confusion, the name of the Sullivan County township was changed to Hillsgrove Township in 1856; the new township name was taken from the village of Hillsgrove, which was (and is) its largest settlement. Hillsgrove Covered Bridge is named for its township and the nearby village, and gave its name to a nearby <a href="one-room%20school">one-room school</a> known as the Bridge View School.

The name Hillsgrove Covered Bridge can also refer to a now vanished covered bridge, also over Loyalsock Creek, but in the village of Hillsgrove. This stood from 1876 until 1934, when it was <a href="wiktionary%3Acondemn">condemned</a> and replaced by a steel and concrete structure. It was the third covered bridge on the site: the first fell into the creek, and the second was torn down to make way for the third bridge.

The first covered bridge in the United States was built in 1800 over the <a href="Schuylkill%20River">Schuylkill River</a> in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, Pennsylvania. According to Susan M. Zacher, author of "The Covered Bridges of Pennsylvania: A Guide", the first covered bridges of the Burr arch truss design were also built in the state. Pennsylvania is estimated to have once had at least 1,500 covered bridges and is believed to have had the most in the country between 1830 and 1875. In 2001, Pennsylvania had more surviving historic covered bridges than any other state; 221 remained in 40 of its 67 counties.

Covered bridges were a transition between stone and metal bridges, the latter made of cast-iron or steel. In 19th-century Pennsylvania, lumber was an abundant resource for bridge construction, but did not last long when exposed to the elements. The roof and enclosed sides of covered bridges protected the structural elements, allowing some of these bridges to survive for well over a century. A Burr arch truss consists of a <a href="Structural%20engineering">load-bearing</a> <a href="arch">arch</a> sandwiching multiple <a href="Truss%23King%20post%20truss">king posts</a>, resulting in a stronger and more rigid structure than one made of either element alone. Although there were 30 covered bridges in Sullivan County in 1890, only five were left by 1954, and as of 2015 only three remain: <a href="Forksville%20Covered%20Bridge">Forksville</a>, Hillsgrove, and <a href="Sonestown%20Covered%20Bridge">Sonestown</a>.

All three Sullivan County covered bridges were built c. 1850 with Burr arch trusses. The Hillsgrove bridge was built for Sullivan County by <a href="Sadler%20Rogers">Sadler Rogers</a> (or Rodgers), a native of Forksville who was only 18 years old at the time. He built the Forksville bridge the same year. The Forksville and Hillsgrove bridges both cross Loyalsock Creek, with the latter about 5 miles (8 km) further downstream. Although most sources do not list the builder of the Sonestown bridge, two newspaper articles on the remaining Sullivan County covered bridges reported that Rodgers had designed or possibly built it as well.
On July 2, 1973, the Hillsgrove bridge was the first covered bridge in Sullivan County to be added to the NRHP, and on July 24, 1980 it was again included on the NRHP in a <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places%23Multiple%20Property%20Submission">Multiple Property Submission</a> of seven <a href="Covered%20Bridges%20of%20Bradford%2C%20Sullivan%20and%20Lycoming%20Counties">Covered Bridges of Bradford, Sullivan and Lycoming Counties</a>. The Hillsgrove bridge is on the 2013 <a href="National%20Bridge%20Inventory">National Bridge Inventory</a> (NBI), which lists the covered bridge as long, with a maximum load of . However, the maximum load posted on the approaches to bridge itself is only . The 2006 NBI listed the bridge's roadway as wide, while according to the NRHP, the bridge's "road surface width" is , which is only sufficient for a single lane of traffic.

As of 2015, each portal has a sign with the posted clearance height of . A sign posted on the east portal above the clearance preserves the following 19th-century limits on its use: "Notice: All persons are forbidden to ride drive or lead any animal over this bridge faster than a walk or to drive more than 15 head of cattle horses or mules thereon at one time or to carry fire thereon except in a safe vessel under a penalty of not less than $.30 for each offence." Prior to the 2010 restoration, the west portal had a "No Trucks Allowed" sign hanging below the clearance sign.
The covered bridge rests on <a href="abutment">abutment</a>s of stone and mortar, which have been reinforced with concrete. There are no parapets. The bridge beams are reinforced in places with steel beams. The bridge deck is made of crosswise "narrow width laid flooring". Wheel guards on the deck separate the roadway from the pedestrian walkways on either side and protect the sides, which are covered with "vertical board and batten siding" almost to the <a href="eaves">eaves</a>. The interior and exterior are painted red. The bridge has long, narrow windows with wooden shutters: the south side has three windows, and the north side has two. An opening between the eaves and the siding runs the length of the bridge on both sides. The gable roof is wooden <a href="Shake%20%28shingle%29">shake shingles</a>. The bridge is supported by a Burr arch truss, and is similar in design and construction to the one in Forksville. The western end of the Hillsgrove bridge lies against a steep hillside, and those approaching the bridge from the west must make a sharp right turn to enter it. Prior to the 2010 restoration, the sides were unpainted, but the portals were painted red, while the gable roof was <a href="sheet%20metal">sheet metal</a> which had been installed over the original wooden shake shingles.

Attitudes towards covered bridges in Sullivan County changed considerably in the last half of the 20th century. Two of the five bridges that remained in 1954 were razed by 1970, when the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Pennsylvania Department of Transportation</a> considered tearing down the Forksville bridge (but renovated it because of its historic nature and appeal to tourists). The Hillsgrove Covered Bridge was added to the NRHP in 1973 and the two other bridges were added in 1980. The <a href="Pennsylvania%20Historical%20and%20Museum%20Commission">Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission</a> now forbids the destruction of any covered bridge on the NRHP in the state and has to approve any renovation work.

In the 19th century the Hillsgrove Covered Bridge survived major floods on March 1, 1865, and June 1, 1889, that destroyed other bridges in the West Branch Susquehanna River valley. Between about 1870 and 1890, logging in the Loyalsock Creek watershed produced lumber rafts that floated beneath the bridge. The bridge was the site of "Uncle Ben's Landing" for lumber rafts, which did not travel at night. These rafts, each containing 5,000–30,000 <a href="Board%20foot">board feet</a> (11.8–70.8 m³) of lumber, were carried down the Loyalsock to its mouth at <a href="Montoursville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Montoursville</a>. The raft era ended when the <a href="eastern%20hemlock">eastern hemlock</a> were all <a href="clearcutting">clearcut</a>.

An April, 1963 article on covered bridges in Sullivan and Lycoming counties noted that the Hillsgrove Bridge's deck was "a bit swaybacked", and according to the NBI data, the bridge was "reconstructed" in 1963. T. Corbin Lewis, a retired electrical <a href="General%20contractor">contractor</a> from Hillsgrove Township, restored the bridge in 1968. The concrete reinforcement on the southwest abutment of the Hillsgrove bridge is dated 1968, but the other work done in this restoration is not documented. Lewis also restored the Forksville Covered Bridge in 1970, with what its NRHP nomination form describes as "all kinds of odd repairs". Lewis' restoration work at Forksville involved cutting windows into the sides of the bridge for the first time, with four windows on the south side and three on the north. While the Hillsgrove bridge does have more windows on the south side (three) than the north (two), it is not known when they were added. A 1936 photograph of the bridge shows no windows on the south side, and no concrete reinforcement of the eastern abutment.
Covered Bridge Road north of Loyalsock Creek is accessed only by the Hillsgrove Covered Bridge at the eastern end, and a bridge over Elk Creek at the western end. Sullivan County replaced the bridge over Elk Creek between March 21 and July 21, 1989. Without the Elk Creek bridge, access for five families, a business, and a <a href="Little%20League%20Baseball">Little League Baseball</a> camp with 110 children was limited to the covered bridge. County officials noted that despite the covered bridge's posted weight limit of , it could still support , sufficient for small fire trucks and ambulances. In an emergency, larger emergency vehicles could <a href="ford%20%28crossing%29">ford</a> the creek if needed. In any case, the limited access did not cause any problems for the four-month period while the Elk Creek bridge was replaced.

The Evans' book describes repairs to the bridge's northeast siding, done between 1991 and 2000. In 2001, the <a href="US%20Department%20of%20Transportation">US Department of Transportation</a> <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a> awarded $360,000 for 80 percent of the restoration costs of the Hillsgrove bridge under the Historic Covered Bridge Preservation Program. It was one of two bridges in Pennsylvania and 43 nationwide selected for the program that year. In 2010, the bridge was rehabilitated for the first time since the 1960s. Sullivan County solicited bids in February, expecting the project to cost between $200,000 and $500,000. The metal roof was replaced with cedar shake shingles, repairs were made to the wooden structure, portals, and siding, the bridge and deck were cleaned, and the bridge was painted red. The rehabilitation cost $150,516, and the bridge reopened in the autumn of 2010.
In 2011, the bridge was badly damaged by historic flooding from <a href="Hurricane%20Irene">Hurricane Irene</a> in late August and <a href="Tropical%20Storm%20Lee%20%282011%29">Tropical Storm Lee</a> in early September. Loyalsock Creek's flood waters swept debris into the bridge, removing much of the siding on the south side, washing out the approaches, damaging the structural beams, and leaving "two trees lodged between the timber low chord and timber deck" on the north side. While the Forksville covered bridge escaped serious damage, Hillsgrove and Sonestown were both closed, and Preservation Pennsylvania issued a report that questioned whether either bridge could be restored.

Sullivan County applied for and received <a href="Federal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> funding for repairs to both bridges. The Hillsgrove bridge was restored first, as it was the main route to a restaurant and heavily used by hunters. Repairs included replacement of broken structural beams, sections of the deck, and siding. Because Loyalsock Creek is an "Exceptional Value Stream", the scaffolding that supported the structure on the creek bed during the $250,000-restoration had to be approved by the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Department%20of%20Environmental%20Protection">Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection</a>. The bridge was reopened on November 21, 2012, just in time for deer hunting season, by one of the Sullivan <a href="County%20commission">County Commissioners</a>; the county commissioner had been married on the bridge exactly 25 years before.

Despite the 2010 restoration, the 2012 <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a> <a href="National%20Bridge%20Inventory">National Bridge Inventory</a> found the bridge to be "Structurally Deficient". In addition, the sufficiency rating of the bridge structure was 16.5 percent, and the bridge railings and approach guardrails did not meet "currently acceptable standards".

As of 2015, the bridge is still used; its average daily traffic was 54 vehicles in 2012. The bridge's 2012 post-flood restoration received an award for Emergency Response. A 2014 book, "America's Covered Bridges - Practical Crossings - Nostalgic Icons", included two photos of the Hillsgrove Covered Bridge (and the nearby Forksville Covered Bridge on the book's cover). According to Zacher, the "Sullivan County bridges, because of their settings, are some of the most attractive in the state".

The following table is a comparison of published measurements of length, width and load recorded in different sources using different methods, as well as the name or names cited. The NBI measures bridge length between the "backwalls of abutments" or pavement grooves and the roadway width as "the most restrictive minimum distance between curbs or rails". The NRHP form was prepared by the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Historical%20and%20Museum%20Commission">Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission</a> (PHMC), which surveyed county engineers, historical and covered bridge societies, and others for all the covered bridges in the commonwealth. The Evans visited every covered bridge in Pennsylvania in 2001 and measured each bridge's length (portal to portal) and width (at the portal) for their book. The data in Zacher's book was based on a 1991 survey of all covered bridges in Pennsylvania by the PHMC and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, aided by local government and private agencies. The article uses primarily the NBI and NRHP data, as they are national programs.

Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta was born on March 28, 1986 at <a href="Lenox%20Hill%20Hospital">Lenox Hill Hospital</a> in <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, to a Catholic family. Her parents both have Italian ancestry; she also has more distant French-Canadian roots. Her parents are Cynthia Louise () and Internet entrepreneur Joseph Germanotta, and she has a younger sister, Natali. Brought up in the <a href="Upper%20West%20Side">Upper West Side</a> of Manhattan, Gaga says that her parents came from lower-class families and worked hard for everything. From age 11, she attended the <a href="Convent%20of%20the%20Sacred%20Heart%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Convent of the Sacred Heart</a>, a private all-girls Roman Catholic school. Gaga described her high school self as "very dedicated, very studious, very disciplined" but also "a bit insecure". She considered herself a misfit and was mocked for "being either too provocative or too eccentric".

Gaga began playing the piano at age four when her mother insisted she become "a cultured young woman". She took piano lessons and practiced through her childhood. The lessons taught her to create music by ear, which she preferred over reading sheet music. Her parents encouraged her to pursue music, and enrolled her in Creative Arts Camp. As a teenager, she played at <a href="open%20mic">open mic</a> nights. Gaga played the lead roles of Adelaide in "<a href="Guys%20and%20Dolls">Guys and Dolls</a>" and Philia in "<a href="A%20Funny%20Thing%20Happened%20on%20the%20Way%20to%20the%20Forum">A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum</a>" at a <a href="Regis%20High%20School%20%28New%20York%20City%29">nearby boys' high school</a>. She also studied <a href="method%20acting">method acting</a> at the <a href="Lee%20Strasberg%20Theatre%20and%20Film%20Institute">Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute</a> for ten years. Gaga unsuccessfully auditioned for New York shows, though she did appear in a small role as a high school student in a 2001 episode of "<a href="The%20Sopranos">The Sopranos</a>" titled "<a href="The%20Telltale%20Moozadell">The Telltale Moozadell</a>". She later said of her inclination towards music:

In 2003, at age 17, Gaga gained early admission to <a href="Collaborative%20Arts%20Project%2021">Collaborative Arts Project 21</a>, a music school at <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a> (NYU)'s <a href="Tisch%20School%20of%20the%20Arts">Tisch School of the Arts</a>, and lived in an <a href="New%20York%20University%20residence%20halls">NYU dorm</a>. She studied music there, and improved her songwriting skills by writing essays on art, religion, social issues and politics, including a thesis on pop artists <a href="Spencer%20Tunick">Spencer Tunick</a> and <a href="Damien%20Hirst">Damien Hirst</a>. She withdrew from school during the second semester of her sophomore year, in 2005, to focus on her music career. That year she also played an unsuspecting diner customer for <a href="MTV">MTV</a>'s "<a href="Boiling%20Points">Boiling Points</a>", a prank reality television show.

In 2014, Gaga said she had been raped at 19, for which she underwent mental and physical therapy. She has <a href="posttraumatic%20stress%20disorder">posttraumatic stress disorder</a> that she attributes to the incident, and says that support from doctors, family and friends has helped her.

In 2005, Gaga recorded two songs with hip-hop singer <a href="Melle%20Mel">Grandmaster Melle Mel</a> for an <a href="audio%20book">audio book</a> accompanying Cricket Casey's children's novel "The Portal in the Park". She also formed a band called the SGBand with some friends from NYU. They played gigs around New York and became a fixture of the downtown Lower East Side club scene. After the 2006 <a href="Songwriters%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Songwriters Hall of Fame</a> New Songwriters Showcase at <a href="The%20Cutting%20Room">The Cutting Room</a> in June, talent scout Wendy Starland recommended her to music producer <a href="Rob%20Fusari">Rob Fusari</a>. Fusari collaborated with Gaga, who traveled daily to New Jersey, helping to develop her songs and compose new material. The producer said they began dating in May 2006, and claimed to have been the first person to call her "Lady Gaga", which was derived from <a href="Queen%20%28band%29">Queen</a>'s song "<a href="Radio%20Ga%20Ga">Radio Ga Ga</a>". Their relationship lasted until January 2007.

Fusari and Gaga established a company called Team Lovechild, <a href="Limited%20liability%20company">LLC</a> to promote her career. They recorded and produced <a href="electropop">electropop</a> tracks, sending them to music industry executives. Joshua Sarubin, the head of <a href="Artists%20and%20repertoire">Artists and repertoire</a> (A&R) at <a href="Def%20Jam%20Recordings">Def Jam Recordings</a>, responded positively and, after approval from Sarubin's boss <a href="L.A.%20Reid">Antonio "L.A." Reid</a>, Gaga was signed to Def Jam in September 2006. She was dropped from the label three months later and returned to her family home for Christmas. She began performing at <a href="neo-burlesque">neo-burlesque</a> shows, which according to her represented freedom. During this time, she met <a href="performance%20art">performance art</a>ist <a href="Lady%20Starlight">Lady Starlight</a>, who helped mold her onstage persona. The pair began performing at downtown club venues like the <a href="Mercury%20Lounge">Mercury Lounge</a>, <a href="The%20Bitter%20End">The Bitter End</a>, and the <a href="Rockwood%20Music%20Hall">Rockwood Music Hall</a>. Their live performance art piece, known as "Lady Gaga and the Starlight Revue" and billed as "The Ultimate Pop Burlesque Rockshow", was a tribute to 1970s variety acts. They performed at the 2007 <a href="Lollapalooza">Lollapalooza</a> music festival.

Having initially focused on <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> <a href="electronic%20dance%20music">electronic dance music</a>, Gaga began to incorporate pop melodies and the <a href="glam%20rock">glam rock</a> style of <a href="David%20Bowie">David Bowie</a> and Queen into her songs. While Gaga and Starlight were performing, Fusari continued to develop the songs he had created with her, sending them to the producer and <a href="music%20executive">record executive</a> <a href="Vincent%20Herbert">Vincent Herbert</a>. In November 2007, Herbert signed Gaga to his label Streamline Records, an <a href="Trade%20name">imprint</a> of Interscope Records, established that month. Gaga later credited Herbert as the man who discovered her. Having served as an apprentice songwriter during an internship at <a href="Famous%20Music">Famous Music Publishing</a>, Gaga struck a <a href="music%20publisher%20%28popular%20music%29">music publishing</a> deal with Sony/ATV. As a result, she was hired to write songs for <a href="Britney%20Spears">Britney Spears</a>, <a href="New%20Kids%20on%20the%20Block">New Kids on the Block</a>, <a href="Fergie%20%28singer%29">Fergie</a>, and <a href="The%20Pussycat%20Dolls">The Pussycat Dolls</a>. At Interscope, musician <a href="Akon">Akon</a> was impressed with her singing abilities when she sang a <a href="scratch%20vocal">reference vocal</a> for one of his tracks in studio. Akon convinced <a href="Jimmy%20Iovine">Jimmy Iovine</a>, chairman and CEO of <a href="Interscope%20Geffen%20A%26amp%3BM">Interscope Geffen A&M</a>, to form a joint deal by having Gaga also sign with his own label <a href="KonLive%20Distribution">KonLive</a>, making her his "franchise player".

In late 2007, Gaga met with songwriter and producer <a href="RedOne">RedOne</a>. She collaborated with him in the recording studio for a week on her debut album, signing with <a href="Cherrytree%20Records">Cherrytree Records</a>, an Interscope imprint established by producer and songwriter <a href="Martin%20Kierszenbaum">Martin Kierszenbaum</a>; she also wrote four songs with Kierszenbaum. Despite securing a record deal, she said that some radio stations found her music too "racy", "dance-oriented", and "underground" for the mainstream market. She stated: "My name is Lady Gaga, I've been on the music scene for years, and I'm telling you, this is what's next."

By 2008, Gaga had relocated to Los Angeles to work extensively with her record label to complete her debut album, "<a href="The%20Fame">The Fame</a>", and to set up her own creative team called the <a href="Haus%20of%20Gaga">Haus of Gaga</a>, modeled on <a href="Andy%20Warhol">Andy Warhol</a>'s <a href="The%20Factory">Factory</a>. "The Fame" was released on August 19, 2008, reached number one in Austria, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and the UK, and the top five in Australia and the US. Its first two singles, "<a href="Just%20Dance%20%28song%29">Just Dance</a>" and "<a href="Poker%20Face%20%28Lady%20Gaga%20song%29">Poker Face</a>", reached number one in the United States, Australia, Canada and the UK. The latter was also the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20singles%23Best-selling%20single%20by%20year%20worldwide">world's best-selling single</a> of 2009, with 9.8 million copies sold that year, and spent a record 83 weeks on "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" magazine's <a href="Digital%20Songs">Digital Songs</a> chart. Three other singles, "<a href="Eh%2C%20Eh%20%28Nothing%20Else%20I%20Can%20Say%29">Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)</a>", "<a href="LoveGame">LoveGame</a>" and "<a href="Paparazzi%20%28Lady%20Gaga%20song%29">Paparazzi</a>", were released from the album; the last one reached number one in Germany. Remixed versions of the singles from "The Fame", except "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)", were included on "<a href="Hitmixes">Hitmixes</a>" in August 2009. At the <a href="52nd%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">52nd Annual Grammy Awards</a>, "The Fame" and "Poker Face" won <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Dance/Electronica%20Album">Best Dance/Electronica Album</a> and <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Dance%20Recording">Best Dance Recording</a>, respectively.
Following her opening act on <a href="The%20Pussycat%20Dolls">The Pussycat Dolls</a>' 2009 <a href="Doll%20Domination%20Tour">Doll Domination Tour</a> in Europe and Oceania, Gaga headlined her worldwide <a href="The%20Fame%20Ball%20Tour">The Fame Ball Tour</a>, which ran from March to September 2009. While traveling the globe, she wrote eight songs for "<a href="The%20Fame%20Monster">The Fame Monster</a>", a reissue of "The Fame". Those new songs were also released as a standalone <a href="Extended%20play">EP</a> on November 18, 2009. Its first single, "<a href="Bad%20Romance">Bad Romance</a>", was released one month earlier and went number one in Canada and the UK, and number two in the US, Australia and New Zealand. "<a href="Telephone%20%28song%29">Telephone</a>", with <a href="Beyonc%C3%A9">Beyoncé</a>, followed as the second single from the EP and became Gaga's fourth UK number one. Its third single was "<a href="Alejandro%20%28song%29">Alejandro</a>", which reached number one in Finland and attracted controversy when its music video was deemed <a href="Blasphemy">blasphemous</a> by the <a href="Catholic%20League%20%28U.S.%29">Catholic League</a>. Both tracks reached the top five in the US. The video for "Bad Romance" became the <a href="List%20of%20most-viewed%20YouTube%20videos">most watched</a> on <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> in April 2010, and that October, Gaga became the first person with more than one billion combined views. At the <a href="2010%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">2010 MTV Video Music Awards</a>, she won eight awards from 13 nominations, including <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20for%20Video%20of%20the%20Year">Video of the Year</a> for "Bad Romance". She was the most nominated artist for a single year, and the first female to receive two nominations for Video of the Year at the same ceremony. "The Fame Monster" won the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Pop%20Vocal%20Album">Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album</a>, and "Bad Romance" won <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Female%20Pop%20Vocal%20Performance">Best Female Pop Vocal Performance</a> and <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Short%20Form%20Music%20Video">Best Short Form Music Video</a> at the <a href="53rd%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">53rd Annual Grammy Awards</a>.

In 2009, Gaga spent a record 150 weeks on the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a> and became the most downloaded female act in a year in the US, with 11.1 million downloads sold, earning an entry in the "<a href="Guinness%20Book%20of%20World%20Records">Guinness Book of World Records</a>". "The Fame" and "The Fame Monster" together have since sold more than 15 million copies worldwide. This success allowed Gaga to start her second worldwide concert tour, <a href="The%20Monster%20Ball%20Tour">The Monster Ball Tour</a>, and release "<a href="The%20Remix%20%28Lady%20Gaga%20album%29">The Remix</a>", her final record with Cherrytree Records and <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20remix%20albums">among the best-selling remix albums of all time</a>. The Monster Ball Tour ran from November 2009 to May 2011 and grossed $227.4 million, making it the <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20concert%20tours">highest-grossing concert tour for a debut headlining artist</a>.

During this era, Gaga ventured into business, collaborating with consumer electronics company <a href="Monster%20Cable%20Products">Monster Cable Products</a> to create in-ear, jewel-encrusted headphones called Heartbeats by Lady Gaga. She also partnered with <a href="Polaroid%20Corporation">Polaroid</a> in January 2010 as their creative director and announced a suite of photo-capture products called Grey Label. Her collaboration with her past record producer and ex-boyfriend Rob Fusari led to a lawsuit against her production team, Mermaid Music LLC. At this time, Gaga was tested borderline positive for <a href="Systemic%20lupus%20erythematosus">lupus</a>, but claimed not to be affected by the symptoms and hoped to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

In February 2011, Gaga released "<a href="Born%20This%20Way%20%28song%29">Born This Way</a>", the lead single from her <a href="Born%20This%20Way%20%28album%29">studio album of the same name</a>. The song sold more than one million copies within five days, earning the Guinness World Record for the fastest selling single on <a href="iTunes">iTunes</a>.

Both reached the top 10 in the US and the UK. Her music video for "The Edge of Glory", unlike her previous work, portrays her dancing on a fire escape and walking on a lonely street, without intricate choreography and back-up dancers.
"Born This Way" was released on May 23, 2011, and debuted atop the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> with first-week sales of <a href="Lists%20of%20fastest-selling%20albums">1.1 million copies</a>. The album sold eight million copies worldwide and received three Grammy nominations, including Gaga's third consecutive nomination for Album of the Year.

While filming the former's music video, Gaga met and started dating actor <a href="Taylor%20Kinney">Taylor Kinney</a> in July 2011, who played her love interest. She also embarked on the <a href="Born%20This%20Way%20Ball">Born This Way Ball</a> tour in April 2012, which was scheduled to conclude the following March, but ended one month earlier when Gaga canceled the remaining dates due to a <a href="Acetabular%20labrum">labral</a> tear of her right hip that required surgery. While refunds for the cancellations were estimated to be worth $25 million, the tour grossed a total of $183.9 million globally.

In 2011, Gaga also worked with <a href="Tony%20Bennett">Tony Bennett</a> on a <a href="jazz">jazz</a> version of "<a href="The%20Lady%20Is%20a%20Tramp">The Lady Is a Tramp</a>", with <a href="Elton%20John">Elton John</a> on "Hello Hello" for the animated feature film "<a href="Gnomeo%20%26amp%3B%20Juliet">Gnomeo & Juliet</a>", and with <a href="The%20Lonely%20Island">The Lonely Island</a> and <a href="Justin%20Timberlake">Justin Timberlake</a> on "<a href="3-Way%20%28The%20Golden%20Rule%29">3-Way (The Golden Rule)</a>". She also performed a concert at the <a href="Sydney%20Town%20Hall">Sydney Town Hall</a> in Australia that year to promote "Born This Way" and to celebrate former US President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>'s 65th birthday. In November, she was featured in a <a href="Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> television special titled "<a href="A%20Very%20Gaga%20Thanksgiving">A Very Gaga Thanksgiving</a>", which attracted 5.7 million American viewers and spawned the release of her fourth EP, "<a href="A%20Very%20Gaga%20Holiday">A Very Gaga Holiday</a>". In 2012, Gaga guest-starred as an animated version of herself in an episode of "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>" called "<a href="Lisa%20Goes%20Gaga">Lisa Goes Gaga</a>", appeared in the documentary films "<a href="The%20Zen%20of%20Bennett">The Zen of Bennett</a>" and "", and released her first fragrance, <a href="Lady%20Gaga%20Fame">Lady Gaga Fame</a>, followed by a second one, <a href="Eau%20de%20Gaga">Eau de Gaga</a>, in 2014.

Gaga began work on her third studio album, "<a href="Artpop">Artpop</a>", in early 2012, during the Born This Way Ball tour; she crafted the album to mirror "a night at the club". In August 2013, Gaga released the album's lead single "<a href="Applause%20%28Lady%20Gaga%20song%29">Applause</a>", which reached number one in Hungary, number four in the US, and number five in the UK. A <a href="lyric%20video">lyric video</a> for "Artpop" track "<a href="Aura%20%28song%29">Aura</a>" followed in October to accompany <a href="Robert%20Rodriguez">Robert Rodriguez</a>'s "<a href="Machete%20Kills">Machete Kills</a>", where she plays an assassin named La Chameleon. The film received generally negative reviews and earned less than half of its $33 million budget. The second "Artpop" single, "<a href="Do%20What%20U%20Want">Do What U Want</a>", featured singer <a href="R.%20Kelly">R. Kelly</a> and was released later that month, topping the charts in Hungary and reaching number 13 in the US. Gaga removed the song from all streaming platforms in 2019 in the light of allegations made against Kelly sexually abusing several women; Gaga apologized for ever collaborating with him. "Artpop" was released in November 2013 to mixed reviews. Helen Brown in "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" criticized Gaga for making another album about her fame and doubted the record's originality, but found it "great for dancing". The album debuted atop the "Billboard" 200 chart, and sold more than 2.5 million copies worldwide as of July 2014. "<a href="G.U.Y.">G.U.Y.</a>" was released as the third single in March 2014 and peaked at number 76 in the US.
Gaga hosted an episode of "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>" in November 2013, performing "Do What U Want" (with Kelly) and an album cut, "<a href="Gypsy%20%28Lady%20Gaga%20song%29">Gypsy</a>". After holding her second Thanksgiving Day television special on <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a>, "<a href="Lady%20Gaga%20and%20the%20Muppets%20Holiday%20Spectacular">Lady Gaga and the Muppets Holiday Spectacular</a>", she performed a special rendition of "Do What U Want" with <a href="Christina%20Aguilera">Christina Aguilera</a> on the <a href="The%20Voice%20%28U.S.%20season%205%29">fifth season</a> of the American reality talent show "<a href="The%20Voice%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">The Voice</a>". In March 2014, Gaga had a <a href="Lady%20Gaga%20Live%20at%20Roseland%20Ballroom">seven-day concert residency</a> commemorating the last performance at New York's <a href="Roseland%20Ballroom">Roseland Ballroom</a> before its closure. Two months later, she embarked on the tour, building on concepts from her <a href="ArtRave">ArtRave</a> promotional event. Earning $83 million, the tour included cities canceled from the Born This Way Ball tour itinerary. In the meantime, Gaga split from longtime manager <a href="Troy%20Carter%20%28music%20industry%29">Troy Carter</a> over "creative differences", and by June 2014, she and new manager Bobby Campbell joined Artist Nation, the artist management division of <a href="Live%20Nation%20Entertainment">Live Nation Entertainment</a>. She briefly appeared in Rodriguez's "", and was confirmed as <a href="Versace">Versace</a>'s spring-summer 2014 face with a campaign called "Lady Gaga For Versace".

In September 2014, Gaga released a collaborative jazz album with Tony Bennett titled "<a href="Cheek%20to%20Cheek%20%28album%29">Cheek to Cheek</a>". The inspiration behind the album came from her friendship with Bennett, and fascination with <a href="jazz%20music">jazz music</a> since her childhood. Before the album was released, it produced the singles "<a href="Anything%20Goes%20%28Cole%20Porter%20song%29%23Tony%20Bennett%20and%20Lady%20Gaga%20version">Anything Goes</a>" and "<a href="I%20Can%27t%20Give%20You%20Anything%20but%20Love%2C%20Baby%23Tony%20Bennett%20and%20Lady%20Gaga%20version">I Can't Give You Anything but Love</a>". "Cheek to Cheek" received generally favorable reviews; "The Guardian"s Caroline Sullivan praised Gaga's vocals and Howard Reich of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" wrote that ""Cheek to Cheek" serves up the real thing, start to finish".

In February 2015, Gaga became engaged to Taylor Kinney. After "Artpop" lukewarm response, Gaga began to redo her image and style. According to "Billboard", this shift started with the release of "Cheek to Cheek" and the attention she received for her performance at the <a href="87th%20Academy%20Awards">87th Academy Awards</a>, where she sang a medley of songs from "<a href="The%20Sound%20of%20Music%20%28film%29">The Sound of Music</a>" in a tribute to <a href="Julie%20Andrews">Julie Andrews</a>.

Gaga had spent much of her early life wanting to be an actress, and achieved her goal when she starred in "". Running from October 2015 to January 2016, "Hotel" is the fifth season of the television <a href="anthology%20series">anthology</a> horror series, "<a href="American%20Horror%20Story">American Horror Story</a>", in which Gaga played a hotel owner named .

She appeared in <a href="Nick%20Knight%20%28photographer%29">Nick Knight</a>'s 2015 fashion film for <a href="Tom%20Ford">Tom Ford</a>'s 2016 spring campaign and was guest editor for "<a href="V%20%28American%20magazine%29">V</a>" fashion magazine's 99th issue in January 2016, which featured 16 different covers. She received Editor of the Year award at the Fashion Los Angeles Awards.

She was honored that April with the Artist Award at the Jane Ortner Education Awards by <a href="The%20Grammy%20Museum">The Grammy Museum</a>, which recognizes artists who have demonstrated passion and dedication to education through the arts. Her engagement to Taylor Kinney ended in July; she later said her career had interfered with their relationship.

Gaga played a witch named <a href="Sc%C3%A1thach">Scathach</a> in "", the series' sixth season, which ran from September to November 2016. Her role in the fifth season of the show ultimately influenced her future music, prompting her to feature "the art of darkness". In September 2016, she released her fifth album's lead single, "<a href="Perfect%20Illusion">Perfect Illusion</a>", which topped the charts in France and reached number 15 in the US. The album, titled "<a href="Joanne%20%28album%29">Joanne</a>", was named after Gaga's late aunt, who was an inspiration for the music. It was released on October 21, 2016, and became Gaga's fourth number one album on the "Billboard" 200, making her the first woman to reach the US chart's summit four times in the 2010s. The album's second single, "<a href="Million%20Reasons">Million Reasons</a>", followed the next month and reached number four in the US. She later released a piano version of the album's <a href="Joanne%20%28Lady%20Gaga%20song%29">title track</a> in 2018, which won a <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Pop%20Solo%20Performance">Grammy for Best Pop Solo Performance</a>. To promote the album, Gaga embarked on the three-date <a href="Dive%20Bar%20Tour">Dive Bar Tour</a>.

Gaga performed as the headlining act during the <a href="Super%20Bowl%20LI%20halftime%20show">Super Bowl LI halftime show</a> on February 5, 2017. Her performance featured a group of hundreds of lighted drones forming various shapes in the sky above Houston's <a href="NRG%20Stadium">NRG Stadium</a>—the first time robotic aircraft appeared in a Super Bowl program. It attracted 117.5 million viewers in the United States, exceeding the game's total of 113.3 million viewers. The performance led to a surge of 410,000 song downloads in the United States for Gaga and earned her an <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy</a> nomination in the <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Special%20Class%20Program">Outstanding Special Class Program</a> category. <a href="CBS%20Sports">CBS Sports</a> included her performance as the second best in the history of Super Bowl halftime shows. In April, Gaga headlined the <a href="Coachella%20Valley%20Music%20and%20Arts%20Festival">Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival</a>. She also released a standalone-single, "<a href="The%20Cure%20%28song%29">The Cure</a>", which reached the top 10 in Australia. In August, Gaga began the <a href="Joanne%20World%20Tour">Joanne World Tour</a>, which she announced after the Super Bowl LI halftime show. Gaga's creation of "Joanne" and preparation for her halftime show performance were featured in the documentary "", which premiered on <a href="Netflix">Netflix</a> in September. Throughout the film, she was seen suffering from <a href="chronic%20pain">chronic pain</a>, which was later revealed to be the effect of a long-term condition called <a href="fibromyalgia">fibromyalgia</a>. It resulted in Gaga canceling the last ten shows of the Joanne World Tour, which ultimately grossed $95 million from 842,000 tickets sold.

In March 2018, Gaga supported the <a href="March%20for%20Our%20Lives">March for Our Lives</a> gun-control rally in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> and released a cover of <a href="Elton%20John">Elton John</a>'s "<a href="Your%20Song">Your Song</a>" for his tribute album "<a href="Revamp%20%26amp%3B%20Restoration%23Revamp">Revamp</a>". Later that year, she starred as a struggling singer named Ally in <a href="Bradley%20Cooper">Bradley Cooper</a>'s critically acclaimed musical romantic drama "<a href="A%20Star%20Is%20Born%20%282018%20film%29">A Star Is Born</a>", a remake of the <a href="A%20Star%20Is%20Born%20%281937%20film%29">1937 film of the same name</a>. The film follows Ally's relationship with singer Jackson Maine (played by Cooper), which becomes strained after her career begins to overshadow his. Cooper approached Gaga after seeing her perform at a cancer research fundraiser; a fan of Cooper's work, Gaga agreed to the project due to its portrayal of addiction and depression. "A Star Is Born" premiered at the <a href="75th%20Venice%20International%20Film%20Festival">75th Venice International Film Festival</a> in August 2018, and was released worldwide in October. <a href="Peter%20Bradshaw">Peter Bradshaw</a> of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" described it as "outrageously watchable" and wrote that "Gaga's ability to be part ordinary person, part extraterrestrial celebrity empress functions at the highest level". "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" <a href="Stephanie%20Zacharek">Stephanie Zacharek</a> similarly highlighted her "knockout performance" and found her "charismatic" without her usual makeup, wigs and costumes. Alongside her nominations for an <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Academy Award</a>, a <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Leading%20Role">BAFTA Award</a>, a <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Motion%20Picture%20%E2%80%93%20Drama">Golden Globe Award</a> and a <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Performance%20by%20a%20Female%20Actor%20in%20a%20Leading%20Role">Screen Actors Guild</a> for Best Actress, Gaga received the <a href="Critics%27%20Choice%20Movie%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Critics' Choice</a> and <a href="National%20Board%20of%20Review%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">National Board of Review</a> awards for the role.

Gaga and Cooper co-wrote and produced most of the songs on the <a href="A%20Star%20Is%20Born%20%282018%20soundtrack%29">soundtrack for "A Star Is Born"</a>, which she insisted they perform live in the film. Its lead single, "<a href="Shallow%20%28Lady%20Gaga%20and%20Bradley%20Cooper%20song%29">Shallow</a>", performed by the two, was released in September and has reached number one in several countries including the United States. The song earned Gaga an Academy Award, a <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Original%20Song">Golden Globe Award</a>, and <a href="Critics%27%20Choice%20Movie%20Award%20for%20Best%20Song">Critics' Choice Movie Award</a> for Best Original Song, as well as the Grammys for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Pop%20Duo/Group%20Performance">Best Pop Duo/Group Performance</a> and <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Song%20Written%20for%20Visual%20Media">Best Song Written for Visual Media</a>. The soundtrack contains 34 tracks, including 19 original songs, and received generally positive reviews; Mark Kennedy of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" called it a "five-star marvel" and Ben Beaumont-Thomas of "The Guardian" termed it an "instant classics full of Gaga's emotional might". Gaga received a <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Film%20Music">BAFTA Award for Best Film Music</a> for her work on the album. Commercially, the soundtrack debuted at number one in the US, making Gaga the only woman with five US number one albums in the 2010s, and breaking her tie with <a href="Taylor%20Swift">Taylor Swift</a> as the most for any female artist this decade. It additionally topped the charts in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Switzerland and the UK. Later that month, Gaga announced her engagement to talent agent Christian Carino whom she had met in early 2017. They ended the engagement in February 2019.

Gaga signed a two-year residency, named <a href="Lady%20Gaga%20Enigma">Lady Gaga Enigma</a>, to perform at the <a href="Monte%20Carlo%20Resort%20and%20Casino">MGM Park Theater</a> in <a href="Las%20Vegas">Las Vegas</a>. The residency consists of two types of shows: Enigma, which focuses on theatricality and includes the singer's biggest hits, and Jazz and Piano, which involves tracks from the <a href="Great%20American%20Songbook">Great American Songbook</a> and stripped-down versions of Gaga's songs. The Enigma residency show opened on December 28, 2018, and the Jazz and Piano show opened on January 20, 2019. She has also started working on her sixth studio album, and was seen in recording studios with producers like <a href="Boys%20Noize">Boys Noize</a>, <a href="DJ%20White%20Shadow">DJ White Shadow</a>, <a href="BloodPop">BloodPop</a>, and <a href="Sophie%20%28musician%29">Sophie</a>.

Gaga grew up listening to artists such as <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>, <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a>, <a href="Stevie%20Wonder">Stevie Wonder</a>, <a href="Queen%20%28band%29">Queen</a>, <a href="Bruce%20Springsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a>, <a href="Pink%20Floyd">Pink Floyd</a>, <a href="Mariah%20Carey">Mariah Carey</a>, the <a href="Grateful%20Dead">Grateful Dead</a>, <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>, <a href="Whitney%20Houston">Whitney Houston</a>, <a href="Elton%20John">Elton John</a>, <a href="Blondie%20%28band%29">Blondie</a> and <a href="Garbage%20%28band%29">Garbage</a>, who have all influenced her music. Gaga's musical inspiration varies from <a href="dance-pop">dance-pop</a> singers such as <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a> and Michael Jackson to glam rock artists such as David Bowie and <a href="Freddie%20Mercury">Freddie Mercury</a>, as well as the theatrics of the <a href="pop%20art">pop art</a>ist Andy Warhol and her own performance roots in musical theater. She has been compared to Madonna, who has said that she sees herself reflected in Gaga. Gaga says that she wants to revolutionize pop music as Madonna has. Gaga has also cited heavy metal bands as an influence, including <a href="Iron%20Maiden">Iron Maiden</a> and <a href="Black%20Sabbath">Black Sabbath</a>. She credits Beyoncé as a key inspiration to pursue a musical career.

Gaga was inspired by her mother to be interested in fashion, which she now says is a major influence and integrated with her music. Stylistically, Gaga has been compared to <a href="Leigh%20Bowery">Leigh Bowery</a>, <a href="Isabella%20Blow">Isabella Blow</a>, and <a href="Cher">Cher</a>; she once commented that as a child, she absorbed Cher's fashion sense and made it her own. She considers <a href="Donatella%20Versace">Donatella Versace</a> her <a href="muse">muse</a> and the English fashion designer <a href="Alexander%20McQueen">Alexander McQueen</a> as an inspiration. In turn, Versace calls Lady Gaga "the fresh Donatella". Gaga has also been influenced by <a href="Diana%2C%20Princess%20of%20Wales">Princess Diana</a>, whom she has admired since her childhood.

Gaga has called the Indian <a href="alternative%20medicine">alternative medicine</a> advocate <a href="Deepak%20Chopra">Deepak Chopra</a> a "true inspiration", and has also quoted Indian leader <a href="Rajneesh">Osho</a>'s book "Creativity" on Twitter. Gaga says she was influenced by Osho's work in valuing rebellion through creativity and equality.

Critics have analyzed and scrutinized Gaga's musical and performance style, as she has experimented with new ideas and images throughout her career. She says the continual reinvention is "liberating" herself, which she has been drawn to since childhood. Gaga is a <a href="contralto">contralto</a> with a <a href="vocal%20range">range</a> spanning from <a href="B%E2%99%AD%20%28musical%20note%29">B♭</a> to <a href="B%20%28musical%20note%29">B</a>. She has changed her vocal style regularly, and considers "Born This Way" "much more vocally up to par with what I've always been capable of". In summing up her voice, "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" wrote: "There's an immense emotional intelligence behind the way she uses her voice. Almost never does she overwhelm a song with her vocal ability, recognizing instead that artistry is to be found in nuance rather than lung power."

Gaga's songs have been called "depthless" by writer <a href="Camille%20Paglia">Camille Paglia</a> in "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>", but according to Evan Sawdey of "<a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>", she "does manage to get you moving and grooving at an almost effortless pace". Gaga believes that "all good music can be played on a piano and still sound like a hit". <a href="Simon%20Reynolds">Simon Reynolds</a> wrote in 2010, "Everything about Gaga came from <a href="electroclash">electroclash</a>, except the music, which wasn't particularly 1980s, just ruthlessly catchy naughties pop glazed with <a href="Auto-Tune">Auto-Tune</a> and undergirded with <a href="Contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a>-ish beats."

Gaga's songs have covered a wide variety of concepts; "The Fame" discusses the lust for stardom, while the follow-up "The Fame Monster" expresses fame's dark side through <a href="paranoia">monster</a> metaphors. "The Fame" is an electropop and dance-pop album that has influences of 1980s pop and 1990s <a href="Europop">Europop</a>, whereas "The Fame Monster" displays Gaga's taste for pastiche, drawing on "Seventies arena glam, perky <a href="ABBA">ABBA</a> <a href="disco">disco</a>, and sugary throwbacks like <a href="Stacey%20Q">Stacey Q</a>". "Born This Way" has lyrics in English, French, German, and Spanish and features themes common to Gaga's controversial songwriting such as sex, love, religion, money, drugs, identity, liberation, sexuality, freedom, and individualism. The album explores new genres, such as <a href="electronic%20rock">electronic rock</a> and <a href="techno">techno</a>.

The themes in "Artpop" revolve around Gaga's personal views of fame, love, sex, <a href="feminism">feminism</a>, self-empowerment, overcoming addiction, and reactions to media scrutiny. "Billboard" describes "Artpop" as "coherently channeling R&B, techno, disco and <a href="rock%20music">rock music</a>". With "Cheek to Cheek", Gaga dabbled in the jazz genre. "Joanne", exploring the genres of country, funk, pop, dance, rock, electronic music and folk, was influenced by her personal life. "A Star Is Born" contains elements of <a href="blues%20rock">blues rock</a>, country and <a href="bubblegum%20pop">bubblegum pop</a>. "Billboard" says its lyrics are about wanting change, its struggle, love, romance, and bonding, describing the music as "timeless, emotional, gritty and earnest. They sound like songs written by artists who, quite frankly, are supremely messed up but hit to the core of the listener."

Featuring constant costume changes and provocative visuals, Gaga's music videos are often described as short films. The video for "Telephone" earned Gaga the Guinness World Record for Most Product Placement in a Video. According to author Curtis Fogel, she explores <a href="Bondage%20%28sexual%29">bondage</a> and <a href="sadomasochism">sadomasochism</a> and highlights prevalent feminist themes. The main themes of her music videos are sex, violence, and power. She calls herself "a little bit of a feminist" and asserts that she is "sexually empowering women".

Gaga has called herself a perfectionist when it comes to her elaborate shows. Her performances have been described as "highly entertaining and innovative"; the blood-spurting performance of "Paparazzi" at the <a href="2009%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">2009 MTV Video Music Awards</a> was described as "eye-popping" by MTV News. She continued the blood-soaked theme during The Monster Ball Tour, causing protests in England from family groups and fans in the aftermath of the <a href="Cumbria%20shootings">Cumbria shootings</a>, in which a taxi driver had killed 12 people, then himself. At the <a href="2011%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">2011 MTV Video Music Awards</a>, Gaga appeared in <a href="drag%20%28clothing%29">drag</a> as her male <a href="alter%20ego">alter ego</a>, Jo Calderone, and delivered a lovesick monologue before a performance of her song "You and I". As Gaga's choreographer and creative director, <a href="Laurieann%20Gibson">Laurieann Gibson</a> provided material for her shows and videos for four years before she was replaced by her assistant <a href="Richard%20%26quot%3BRichy%26quot%3B%20Jackson%20%28choreographer%29">Richard Jackson</a> in 2014.

In an article for "Billboard" by Rebecca Schiller in October 2018, the author traced back Gaga's videography from "Just Dance" till the release of "A Star Is Born". Schiller noted how, following the "Artpop" era, Gaga's stripped-down approach to music was reflected in the clips for the singles from "Joanne", taking the example of the music video of lead single "Perfect Illusion" where the singer "[ditched] the elaborate outfits for shorts and a tee-shirt as she performed the song at a desert party". It continued with her performances in the film as well as her stage persona.

Public reception of Gaga's music, fashion sense, and persona is polarized. Because of her influence on modern culture, and her rise to global fame, sociologist Mathieu Deflem of the <a href="University%20of%20South%20Carolina">University of South Carolina</a> has offered a course titled "Lady Gaga and the Sociology of the Fame" since early 2011 with the objective of unraveling "some of the sociologically relevant dimensions of the fame of Lady Gaga". When Gaga met briefly with then-president <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> at a <a href="Human%20Rights%20Campaign">Human Rights Campaign</a> fundraiser, he found the interaction "intimidating" as she was dressed in 16-inch heels, making her the tallest woman in the room. When interviewed by <a href="Barbara%20Walters">Barbara Walters</a> for her annual <a href="ABC%20News">ABC News</a> special "<a href="Barbara%20Walters%27%2010%20Most%20Fascinating%20People">10 Most Fascinating People</a>" in 2009, Gaga dismissed the claim that she is <a href="intersex">intersex</a> as an <a href="urban%20legend">urban legend</a>. Responding to a question on this issue, she expressed her fondness for <a href="androgyny">androgyny</a>. In a 2010 "<a href="Sunday%20Times">Sunday Times</a>" article, Camille Paglia called Gaga "more an identity thief than an erotic taboo breaker, a mainstream manufactured product who claims to be singing for the freaks, the rebellious and the dispossessed when she is none of those".

Gaga's outlandish fashion sense has also served as an important aspect of her character. During her early career, members of the media compared her fashion choices to those of <a href="Christina%20Aguilera">Christina Aguilera</a>. In 2011, 121 women gathered at the <a href="53rd%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">Grammy Awards</a> dressed in costumes similar to those worn by Gaga, earning the 2011 Guinness World Record for Largest Gathering of Lady Gaga Impersonators. The <a href="Global%20Language%20Monitor">Global Language Monitor</a> named "Lady Gaga" as the Top Fashion Buzzword with her trademark "no pants" a close third. "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" put her outfits on its end of the decade "best-of" list, saying that she "brought performance art into the mainstream".

"<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" placed Gaga on their All-Time 100 Fashion Icons List, stating: "Lady Gaga is just as notorious for her outrageous style as she is for her pop hits ... [Gaga] has sported outfits made from plastic bubbles, <a href="Kermit%20the%20Frog">Kermit the Frog</a> dolls, and raw meat." Gaga wore a <a href="Lady%20Gaga%27s%20meat%20dress">dress made of raw beef</a> to the <a href="2010%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">2010 MTV Video Music Awards</a>, which was supplemented by boots, a purse, and a hat also made out of raw beef. Partly awarded in recognition of the dress, "<a href="Vogue%20%28magazine%29">Vogue</a>" named her one of the Best Dressed people of 2010 and "Time" named the dress the Fashion Statement of the year. It attracted the attention of worldwide media; the animal rights organization <a href="People%20for%20the%20Ethical%20Treatment%20of%20Animals">PETA</a> found it offensive. The meat dress was displayed at the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Women%20in%20the%20Arts">National Museum of Women in the Arts</a> in 2012, and entered the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> in September 2015.

Gaga's fans call her "Mother Monster", and she often refers to them as "Little Monsters", a phrase which she had tattooed on herself in dedication. In his article "Lady Gaga Pioneered Online Fandom Culture As We Know It" for "<a href="Vice%20%28magazine%29">Vice</a>", Jake Hall wrote that Gaga inspired several subsequent fan-branding, such as those of <a href="Taylor%20Swift">Taylor Swift</a>, <a href="Rihanna">Rihanna</a> and <a href="Justin%20Bieber">Justin Bieber</a>. In July 2012, Gaga also co-founded the <a href="social%20networking%20service">social networking service</a> LittleMonsters.com, devoted to her fans. According to "Guinness World Records", Gaga was the most followed person on <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> in 2011, the most followed female pop singer in 2014 and the most powerful pop-star in 2014. "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" included Gaga on its <a href="Forbes%20Celebrity%20100">Celebrity 100</a> from 2010 to 2015 and then in 2018 and its list of the <a href="Forbes%20list%20of%20The%20World%27s%20100%20Most%20Powerful%20Women">World's Most Powerful Women</a> from 2010 to 2014. She earned $62 million, $90 million, $52 million, $80 million, $33 million, and $59 million from 2010 through 2015 and $50 million in 2018. She was named <a href="Time%20100">one of the most influential people</a> in the world by "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine in 2010 and ranked second in most influential people of the past ten years in a "Time" magazine readers' poll in 2013. In March 2012, Gaga was ranked fourth on "Billboard"s list of top moneymakers of 2011 with earnings of $25 million, which included sales from "Born This Way" and her Monster Ball Tour. The following year, she topped "Forbes" List of Top-Earning Celebs Under 30, and in February 2016, the magazine estimated Gaga's net worth to be $275 million.

After declining an invitation to appear on the single "<a href="We%20Are%20the%20World%2025%20for%20Haiti">We Are the World 25</a>" (because of rehearsals for her tour) to benefit victims of the <a href="2010%20Haiti%20earthquake">2010 Haiti earthquake</a>, Gaga donated the proceeds of her January 2010 <a href="Radio%20City%20Music%20Hall">Radio City Music Hall</a> concert to the country's reconstruction relief fund. All profits from her online store that day were also donated, and Gaga announced that $500,000 was collected for the fund. Hours after the <a href="2011%20T%C5%8Dhoku%20earthquake%20and%20tsunami">2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami</a> hit Japan, Gaga tweeted a link to Japan Prayer Bracelets. All revenue from a bracelet she designed in conjunction with the company was donated to relief efforts; these raised $1.5 million. In June 2011, Gaga performed at <a href="MTV%20Japan">MTV Japan</a>'s charity show in <a href="Makuhari%20Messe">Makuhari Messe</a>, which benefited the <a href="Japanese%20Red%20Cross">Japanese Red Cross</a>.

In 2012, Gaga joined the campaign group <a href="Artists%20Against%20Fracking">Artists Against Fracking</a>. That October, <a href="Yoko%20Ono">Yoko Ono</a> gave Gaga and four other activists the <a href="LennonOno%20Grant%20for%20Peace">LennonOno Grant for Peace</a> in <a href="Reykjav%C3%ADk">Reykjavík</a>, Iceland. The following month, Gaga pledged to donate $1 million to the American Red Cross to help the victims of <a href="Hurricane%20Sandy">Hurricane Sandy</a>. Gaga also contributes in the fight against <a href="HIV/AIDS">HIV and AIDS</a>, focusing on educating young women about the risks of the disease. In collaboration with <a href="Cyndi%20Lauper">Cyndi Lauper</a>, Gaga joined forces with <a href="Make-up%20Art%20Cosmetics">MAC Cosmetics</a> to launch a line of lipstick under their supplementary cosmetic line, Viva Glam.

The <a href="Publicity%20Department%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20China">Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China</a> (CCPPD) also issued an order for state-controlled media to condemn this meeting.

In 2012, Gaga launched the <a href="Born%20This%20Way%20Foundation">Born This Way Foundation</a> (BTWF), a non-profit organization that focuses on youth empowerment. It takes its name from her 2011 single and album. Media proprietor <a href="Oprah%20Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a>, writer Deepak Chopra, and US Secretary of Health and Human Services <a href="Kathleen%20Sebelius">Kathleen Sebelius</a> spoke at the foundation's inauguration at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>. The foundation's original funding included $1.2 million from Gaga, $500,000 from the MacArthur Foundation, and $850,000 from <a href="Barneys%20New%20York">Barneys New York</a>. In July 2012, the BTWF partnered with <a href="Office%20Depot">Office Depot</a>, which donated 25% of the sales, a minimum of $1 million of a series of limited edition back-to-school products. The foundation's initiatives have included the "Born Brave Bus" that followed her on tour as a youth drop-in center as an initiative against bullying.

In October 2015, at the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, Gaga joined 200 high school students, policy makers, and academic officials, including <a href="Peter%20Salovey">Peter Salovey</a>, to discuss ways to recognize and channel emotions for positive outcomes. In 2016, the foundation partnered with Intel, <a href="Vox%20Media">Vox Media</a>, and "<a href="Re/code">Re/code</a>" to fight online harassment. The sales revenue of the 99th issue of the "V" magazine, which featured Gaga and Kinney, was donated to the foundation. Gaga and Elton John released the clothing and accessories line Love Bravery at <a href="Macy%27s">Macy's</a> in May. 25% of each purchase support Gaga's foundation and the <a href="Elton%20John%20AIDS%20Foundation">Elton John AIDS Foundation</a>. Gaga partnered with <a href="Starbucks">Starbucks</a> for a week in June 2017 with the "Cups of Kindness" campaign, where the company donated 25 cents from some of the beverages sold to the foundation. She also appeared in a video by <a href="Staples%20Inc.">Staples Inc.</a> to raise funds for the foundation and DonorsChoose.org.

On the 2018 <a href="World%20Kindness%20Day">World Kindness Day</a>, Gaga partnered with the foundation to bring food and relief to a <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> shelter for people who have been forced to evacuate homes due to the <a href="2018%20California%20wildfires">California wildfires</a>. The foundation also partnered with Starbucks and <a href="SoulCycle">SoulCycle</a> to thank California firefighters for their relief work during the crisis. The singer had to previously evacuate her own home during the <a href="Woolsey%20Fire">Woolsey Fire</a> which spread through parts of Malibu.

As a bisexual woman, Gaga actively supports <a href="LGBT%20rights%20by%20country%20or%20territory">LGBT rights worldwide</a>. She attributes much of her early success as a mainstream artist to her <a href="homosexuality">gay</a> fans and is considered a gay icon. Early in her career she had difficulty getting <a href="airplay">radio airplay</a>, and stated, "The turning point for me was the gay community." She thanked FlyLife, a Manhattan-based <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> marketing company with whom her label Interscope works, in the liner notes of "The Fame". One of her first televised performances was in May 2008 at the <a href="NewNowNext%20Awards">NewNowNext Awards</a>, an awards show aired by the LGBT television network <a href="Logo%20%28TV%20channel%29">Logo</a>.

Gaga spoke at the 2009 <a href="National%20Equality%20March">National Equality March</a> in Washington in support of the LGBT movement. She attended the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards accompanied by four gay and lesbian former members of the <a href="United%20States%20Armed%20Forces">United States Armed Forces</a> who had been unable to serve <a href="Coming%20out">openly</a> under the US military's "<a href="don%27t%20ask%2C%20don%27t%20tell">don't ask, don't tell</a>" policy, which banned open homosexuality in the military. Gaga urged her fans via YouTube to contact their senators in an effort to overturn the policy. In September 2010, she spoke at a <a href="Servicemembers%20Legal%20Defense%20Network">Servicemembers Legal Defense Network</a>'s rally in <a href="Portland%2C%20Maine">Portland, Maine</a>. Following this event, "<a href="The%20Advocate%20%28LGBT%20magazine%29">The Advocate</a>" named her a "fierce advocate" for gays and lesbians. Gaga appeared at <a href="Europride">Europride</a>, an international event dedicated to LGBT pride, in Rome in June 2011. She criticized the poor state of <a href="LGBT%20rights%20in%20Europe">gay rights in many European countries</a> and described gay people as "revolutionaries of love". Gaga was ordained as a minister by the <a href="Universal%20Life%20Church%20Monastery">Universal Life Church Monastery</a> so that she could officiate the wedding of two female friends.

In June 2016, during a vigil held in Los Angeles for victims of the <a href="2016%20Orlando%20nightclub%20shooting">attack at the gay nightclub Pulse</a> in Orlando, Gaga read aloud the names of the 49 people killed in the attack, and gave a speech. Later that month, Gaga appeared in <a href="Human%20Rights%20Campaign">Human Rights Campaign</a>'s tribute video to the victims of the attack. She has opposed the <a href="presidency%20of%20Donald%20Trump">presidency of Donald Trump</a> and deplored his military transgender ban. She supported former <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a> for president in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202016">2016</a>. In 2018, a leaked memo from Trump's office revealed that his administration wanted to change the legal definition of sex in order to exclude <a href="transgender">transgender</a> Americans. Gaga was one of the many celebrities to call him out and spread the #WontBeErased campaign to her 77 million Twitter followers. In January 2019, during one of her Enigma shows, she called out Vice President <a href="Mike%20Pence">Mike Pence</a> for his wife <a href="Karen%20Pence">Karen Pence</a> working at a school where LGBTQ people are turned away.

Gaga was named the "<a href="Honorific%20nicknames%20in%20popular%20music%23L">Queen of Pop</a>" in a 2011 ranking by "Rolling Stone" (based on record sales and social media metrics), and she ranked fourth in <a href="VH1">VH1</a>'s <a href="The%20Greatest%20%28TV%20series%29">Greatest Women in Music</a> in 2012. In 2012, she became a feature of a temporary exhibition "The Elevated. From the Pharaoh to Lady Gaga" marking the 150th anniversary of the <a href="National%20Museum%2C%20Warsaw">National Museum in Warsaw</a>.

Gaga has been often regarded as a trailblazer for sometimes utilizing controversy to bring attention to various issues. Because of "The Fame" success—it was listed as one of the 100 Greatest Debut Albums of All-Time by "Rolling Stone" in 2013—Gaga is acknowledged as one of the artists who propelled the rise in the popularity of synthpop in the late 2000s and early 2010s. Scott Hardy, Polaroid's CEO, has praised Gaga for inspiring her fans and for her close interactions with them on social media.

According to <a href="Kelefa%20Sanneh">Kelefa Sanneh</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>", "Lady Gaga blazed a trail for truculent pop stars by treating her own celebrity as an evolving art project." Including "Born This Way" as one of the 50 best female albums of all time, "Rolling Stone" <a href="Rob%20Sheffield">Rob Sheffield</a> considers it "hard to remember a world where we didn't have Gaga, although we're pretty sure it was a lot more boring". In 2015, "Time" also noted that Gaga had "practically invented the current era of pop music as spectacle". Her work has influenced artists including <a href="Miley%20Cyrus">Miley Cyrus</a>, <a href="Nicki%20Minaj">Nicki Minaj</a>, <a href="Ellie%20Goulding">Ellie Goulding</a>, <a href="Halsey%20%28singer%29">Halsey</a>, <a href="Nick%20Jonas">Nick Jonas</a>, <a href="Sam%20Smith%20%28singer%29">Sam Smith</a>, <a href="Noah%20Cyrus">Noah Cyrus</a>, <a href="Katherine%20Langford">Katherine Langford</a>, <a href="MGMT">MGMT</a>, and <a href="Greyson%20Chance">Greyson Chance</a>.

A new genus of <a href="fern">fern</a>s, "<a href="Gaga%20%28plant%29">Gaga</a>", and two species, "G. germanotta" and "G. monstraparva", have been named in her honor. The name "monstraparva" alluded to Gaga's fans, known as "little monsters", since their symbol is the outstretched "monster claw" hand, which resembles a tightly rolled young fern leaf prior to unfurling. Gaga also has an extinct mammal, "<a href="Gagadon">Gagadon</a> minimonstrum", and a parasitic wasp, "<a href="Aleiodes%20gaga">Aleiodes gaga</a>", named for her.

Gaga has won nine <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>s, an <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a>, a <a href="British%20Academy%20Film%20Awards">BAFTA Award</a>, three <a href="Brit%20Awards">Brit Awards</a>, two <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award">Golden Globe Award</a>s, thirteen <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award">MTV Video Music Award</a>s, several <a href="Guinness%20World%20Records">Guinness World Records</a>, and the inaugural <a href="Songwriters%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Songwriters Hall of Fame</a>'s Contemporary Icon Award. She received a <a href="National%20Arts%20Awards">National Arts Awards</a>' Young Artist Award, which honors individuals who have shown accomplishments and leadership early in their career, and she won the Jane Ortner Artist Award from the <a href="Grammy%20Museum">Grammy Museum</a> in 2016. Gaga has also been recognized by the <a href="Council%20of%20Fashion%20Designers%20of%20America">Council of Fashion Designers of America</a> (CFDA) with the Fashion Icon lifetime achievement award, and was a finalist for "The Advocate"s Person of the Year in 2016. In 2019, she became the first person to win an Academy, a Grammy, a BAFTA and a Golden Globe Award in one year for her contribution to "A Star Is Born"s soundtrack.

Gaga is one of <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20music%20artists">the best-selling music artists</a> with estimated sales of 27 million albums and 146 million singles as of January 2016. Some of her singles are also among the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20singles">best-selling worldwide</a>. She has grossed more than $512.3 million in revenue from her concert tours and residencies, becoming the fifth woman to pass the half-billion total as reported to "Billboard" Boxscore. Gaga has consecutively appeared on "Billboard" magazine's Artists of the Year (scoring the definitive title in 2010). Named <a href="Billboard%20Women%20in%20Music">Woman of the Year</a> in 2015, she is the 11th <a href="List%20of%20highest-certified%20music%20artists%20in%20the%20United%20States">top digital singles artist</a> in the US with a total of 61 million equivalent units certified according to <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA).

Exelon Pavilions

The Exelon Pavilions are four buildings that generate electricity from <a href="solar%20energy">solar energy</a> and provide access to underground parking in <a href="Millennium%20Park">Millennium Park</a> in the <a href="Chicago%20Loop">Loop</a> <a href="Community%20areas%20of%20Chicago">community area</a> of <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> in <a href="Cook%20County%2C%20Illinois">Cook County</a>, <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>, United States. The Northeast Exelon Pavilion and Northwest Exelon Pavilion (jointly the North Exelon Pavilions) are located on the northern edge of the park along <a href="Randolph%20Street">Randolph Street</a>, and flank the <a href="Harris%20Theater%20%28Chicago%2C%20Illinois%29">Harris Theater</a>. The Southeast Exelon Pavilion and Southwest Exelon Pavilion (jointly the South Exelon Pavilions) are located on the southern edge of the park along Monroe Street, and flank the <a href="Lurie%20Garden">Lurie Garden</a>. Together the pavilions generate of electricity annually, worth about $2,350 per year.

The four pavilions, which cost , were designed in ; construction began in . The South Pavilions were completed and opened in , while the North Pavilions were completed in , with a grand opening on , 2005. In addition to producing energy, three of the four pavilions provide access to the parking garages below the park, while the fourth serves as the park's welcome center and office. <a href="Exelon">Exelon</a>, a company that generates the electricity transmitted by its subsidiary <a href="Commonwealth%20Edison">Commonwealth Edison</a>, donated $5.5 million for the pavilions. "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" architecture critic <a href="Blair%20Kamin">Blair Kamin</a> praised the South Pavilions as "minor modernist jewels", but criticized the North Pavilions as "nearly all black and impenetrable". The North Pavilions have received the <a href="Leadership%20in%20Energy%20and%20Environmental%20Design">Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design</a> (LEED) silver rating from the <a href="United%20States%20Green%20Building%20Council">United States Green Building Council</a>, as well as an award from the <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Heating%2C%20Refrigerating%20and%20Air-Conditioning%20Engineers">American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers</a> (ASHRAE).

Lying between <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Lake Michigan</a> to the east and the Loop to the west, <a href="Grant%20Park%20%28Chicago%29">Grant Park</a> has been Chicago's front yard since the mid-19th century. Its northwest corner, north of Monroe Street and the <a href="Art%20Institute%20of%20Chicago">Art Institute</a>, east of <a href="Michigan%20Avenue%20%28Chicago%29">Michigan Avenue</a>, south of Randolph Street, and west of Columbus Drive, had been <a href="Illinois%20Central%20Railroad">Illinois Central</a> rail yards and parking lots until 1997, when it was made available for development by the city as <a href="Millennium%20Park">Millennium Park</a>. As of 2009, Millennium Park trailed only <a href="Navy%20Pier">Navy Pier</a> as a Chicago tourist attraction.

In 1836, a year before Chicago was incorporated, the Board of Canal Commissioners held public auctions for the city's first lots.
Citizens with the foresight to keep the lakefront as public open space convinced the commissioners to designate the land east of Michigan Avenue between Randolph Street and Park Row (11th Street) "Public Ground—A Common to Remain Forever Open, Clear and Free of Any Buildings, or Other Obstruction, whatever." Grant Park has been "forever open, clear and free" since, protected by legislation that has been affirmed by four previous <a href="Illinois%20Supreme%20Court">Illinois Supreme Court</a> rulings. In 1839, United States Secretary of War <a href="Joel%20Roberts%20Poinsett">Joel Roberts Poinsett</a> decommissioned the <a href="Fort%20Dearborn">Fort Dearborn</a> reserve and declared the land between Randolph Street and Madison Street east of Michigan Avenue "Public Ground forever to remain vacant of buildings".

<a href="Aaron%20Montgomery%20Ward">Aaron Montgomery Ward</a>, who is known both as the inventor of <a href="mail%20order">mail order</a> and the protector of Grant Park, twice sued the city of Chicago to force it to remove buildings and structures from Grant Park, and to keep it from building new ones. In 1890, arguing that Michigan Avenue property owners held <a href="easement">easement</a>s on the park land, Ward commenced legal actions to keep the park free of new buildings. In 1900, the Illinois Supreme Court concluded that all landfill east of Michigan Avenue was subject to dedications and easements. In 1909, when he sought to prevent the construction of the <a href="Field%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">Field Museum of Natural History</a> in the center of the park, the courts affirmed his arguments and the museum was built elsewhere.

As a result, the city has what are termed the Montgomery Ward height restrictions on buildings and structures in Grant Park; structures over tall are not allowed in the park, with the exception of <a href="bandshell">bandshell</a>s. However, within Millennium Park, the "<a href="Crown%20Fountain">Crown Fountain</a>" and the <a href="Jay%20Pritzker%20Pavilion">Jay Pritzker Pavilion</a> were exempt from the height restrictions, because they were classified as works of art and not buildings or structures. Shorter structures do not run afoul of the height restrictions. The <a href="Harris%20Theater%20%28Chicago%2C%20Illinois%29">Harris Theater</a>, which lies between the North Pavilions, was built mostly underground to avoid the restrictions. The Northwest Pavilion, tallest of the four, is three stories high; the Northeast Pavilion is two stories, and the South Pavilions are each one story.

The pavilions are named for <a href="Exelon">Exelon</a>, a Chicago-based company that generates the electricity transmitted by its subsidiary <a href="Commonwealth%20Edison">Commonwealth Edison</a> (ComEd). The city of Chicago has collaborated with Exelon and ComEd on a variety of environmental projects, including the installation of <a href="solar%20power">solar power</a> in buildings, support for <a href="sustainable%20design">sustainable design</a> and <a href="renewable%20energy">renewable energy</a>, and furthering educational and social awareness of green architecture in the city. The pavilions cost $7 million, $5.5 million of which was donated by Exelon and ComEd.

The lead designer for the North Pavilions was Thomas H. Beeby of Hammond Beeby Rupert Ainge Architects. Beeby's designs for the North Pavilions are "in harmony with the Harris Theater", for which he was the architect as well. The North Pavilions are along Randolph Street on either side of the theater, which is Millennium Park's indoor performing-arts venue.

The South Pavilions were designed by architect <a href="Renzo%20Piano">Renzo Piano</a> of Renzo Piano Building Workshop. Piano designed the Art Institute of Chicago's Modern Wing, which is across Monroe Street from the South Pavilions and opened in 2009. The <a href="facade">facade</a>s of the South Pavilions are limestone and glass in order to complement the Modern Wing, even though it was not completed until several years after the pavilions were finished. Piano also designed the <a href="Nichols%20Bridgeway">Nichols Bridgeway</a>, which connects Millennium Park and the Art Institute, and is next to the Southwest Pavilion.

The design process for the Exelon Pavilions began in , with construction starting in . The general contractor for all four pavilions was Walsh Construction. The South Pavilions were completed in and opened when Millennium Park celebrated its grand opening on , 2004. The North Pavilions were not finished in , but were completed in November of that year. All four Exelon Pavilions were officially opened to the public on , 2005.

The North Pavilions were designed as <a href="minimalist">minimalist</a> black cubes, and together are capable of producing of electricity annually. The outermost layer of the exterior of each pavilion is a curtain wall made of recycled aluminum. These walls contain specially designed "mono-crystalline <a href="photovoltaic">photovoltaic</a> modules and insulated glass". <a href="Convection">Convection</a> from radiant <a href="solar%20heat%20gain">solar heat gain</a> causes air to cycle within air cavities covered by the photovoltaic modules. A "highly heat-reflective <a href="thermoplastic">thermoplastic</a> membrane" is used to waterproof each roof, and helps mitigate the <a href="urban%20heat%20island">urban heat island</a> effect.

The photovoltaic modules generate electricity to power much of the pavilions' lighting. The North Pavilions are the first Chicago buildings to use <a href="building%20integrated%20photovoltaic">building integrated photovoltaic</a> cells, which are a solar energy system incorporated into the building's structural elements. Millennium Park's planners claimed that the pavilions had the first electricity-generating curtain walls in the <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">Midwest</a>.

The Northwest Pavilion, located at 151 E. Randolph Street, houses the Millennium Park Welcome Center and an Exelon energy display. It contains the Millennium Park offices, and public restrooms. The three-story Northwest Pavilion is the largest of the four pavilions, with , and is the only pavilion that does not provide access to the parking garage below. The Northwest Pavilion has 460 photovoltaic modules to harness solar energy, houses recycling facilities, and its "interior finishes and construction materials are derived from renewable resources".

The Millennium Park Welcome Center in the Northwest Pavilion offers guides to the park and wheelchairs. It houses exhibitions on parks and energy, and has interactive displays on how the pavilions' solar panels function and on renewable energy. There are exhibits with interactive web-based <a href="touch%20screen">touch screen</a>s that depict the city's use of solar energy, and a dynamic multi-screen video presentation on electricity generation and usage. The building's <a href="Atrium%20%28architecture%29">atrium</a> includes a sculpture by Chicago-based artists Patrick McGee and <a href="Adelheid%20Mers">Adelheid Mers</a> with three backlit two-way mirrors. The sculpture, titled "Heliosphere, Biosphere, Technosphere", is "designed to interpret the links between the Earth's atmosphere, the solar system and scientific applications". It is the only permanent work of art by Chicago artists within the park.

The Northeast Pavilion houses a pedestrian entrance to the Millennium Park parking garage, and provides access to the Harris Theater's rooftop terrace. It is at 201 E. Randolph Street, east of the theater and west of the <a href="McDonald%27s%20Cycle%20Center">McDonald's Cycle Center</a>. The pavilion's second floor has the Chicago Shop, which offers a self-guided Millennium Park <a href="audio%20tour">audio tour</a> for rental and sells official Millennium Park and Chicago souvenirs. The two-story Northeast Pavilion is the second-largest, with of surface area, and also has 460 photovoltaic modules to generate electricity from sunlight.

The south pavilions are east and west of the <a href="Lurie%20Garden">Lurie Garden</a> along Monroe Street, and their glass walls allow views of the garden. Both of the South Pavilions provide access to the parking garage below the park. The Southwest Pavilion is the smallest of the four pavilions, and has the least number of photovoltaic modules with 16 on its roof. It is west of the garden and east of the Nichols Bridgeway. The Southeast Pavilion is east of the garden, has the second smallest area at , and has 24 rooftop photovoltaic modules. Together these two pavilions are capable of producing of electricity annually.

<a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>-winning "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" architecture critic <a href="Blair%20Kamin">Blair Kamin</a> praised the decision to have architects design the pavilions as an "inspired stroke", speculating that if their designs had been left to contractors, visitors to Millennium Park could have instead seen unimpressive "blunt utilitarian huts". Kamin was pleased with Piano's South Pavilions, describing them as "minor modernist jewels, almost house-like". He lauded the way their limestone walls complement the transparent glass by way of contrast, and noted that they anticipated Piano's then-forthcoming addition to the <a href="Art%20Institute%20of%20Chicago%20Building">Art Institute of Chicago Building</a>. Kamin gave the South Pavilions a rating of three stars out of a possible four, or "very good".

Kamin was less pleased with Beeby's North Pavilions, which he described as "nearly all black and impenetrable" and compared to <a href="Darth%20Vader">Darth Vader</a>'s helmet. He acknowledged the pavilions' innovative technology, and their "urban design function" as wings for the Harris Theater, which Kamin felt "allows the theater to better stand up to the <a href="Frank%20Gehry">Frank Gehry</a>-designed Pritzker Pavilion to its south". Because they were not finished when he wrote his review in , Kamin did not give the North Pavilions an overall star rating; he did express the hope that they would have a more pleasant appearance once completed.

The pavilions have been recognized for their innovative use of renewable energy and green design. In 2005, the North Pavilions received the <a href="Leadership%20in%20Energy%20and%20Environmental%20Design">Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design</a> (LEED) silver rating from the <a href="United%20States%20Green%20Building%20Council">United States Green Building Council</a>.

McDonald's Cycle Center

McDonald's Cycle Center (formerly Millennium Park Bike Station) is an indoor <a href="bike%20station">bike station</a> in the northeast corner of <a href="Millennium%20Park">Millennium Park</a> in the <a href="Chicago%20Loop">Loop</a> <a href="Community%20areas%20in%20Chicago">community area</a> of <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, in the U.S. state of <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>. The city of Chicago built the center at the intersection of <a href="East%20Randolph%20Street">East Randolph Street</a> and <a href="Columbus%20Drive%20%28Chicago%29">Columbus Drive</a>, and opened it July 2004. Since June 2006, it has been sponsored by <a href="McDonald%27s">McDonald's</a> and several other partners, including city departments and bicycle advocacy organizations. The bike station, which serves <a href="bicycle%20commuting">bicycle commuters</a> and <a href="utility%20cycling">utility cyclists</a>, provides lockers, showers, a snack bar with outdoor summer seating, bike repair, bike rental and 300 bicycle parking spaces. The Cycle Center is accessible by membership and day pass. It also accommodates runners and <a href="inline%20skating">inline skaters</a>, and provides space for a <a href="Chicago%20Police%20Department">Chicago Police Department</a> <a href="police%20bicycle">Bike Patrol</a> Group.

Planning for the Cycle Center was part of the larger "Bike 2010 Plan", in which the city aimed to make itself more accommodating to bicycle commuters. This plan (now replaced by the "Bike 2015 Plan") included provisions for front-mounted two-bike carriers on <a href="Chicago%20Transit%20Authority">Chicago Transit Authority</a> (CTA) buses, permitting bikes to be carried on <a href="Chicago%20%27L%27">Chicago 'L'</a> trains, installing numerous bike racks and creating bicycle lanes in streets throughout the city. Additionally, the <a href="Chicago%20metropolitan%20area">Chicago metropolitan area</a>'s other <a href="mass%20transit">mass transit</a> providers, <a href="Metra">Metra</a> and <a href="Pace%20%28transit%29">Pace</a>, have developed increased bike accessibility. <a href="Chicago%20Mayor">Chicago Mayor</a> <a href="Richard%20M.%20Daley">Richard M. Daley</a> was an advocate of the plan, noting it is also an environmentally friendly effort to cut down on traffic. McDonald's controversially claimed that, since it is providing a healthier menu and fostering grade school <a href="physical%20education">physical education</a> in an effort to help its customers improve their health, sponsoring bicycle and exercise activity in the park augments the company's other initiatives.

<a href="Environmentalist">Environmentalist</a>s, <a href="urban%20planner">urban planner</a>s and cycling enthusiasts around the world have expressed interest in the Cycle Center, and want to emulate what they see as a success story in urban planning and <a href="transit-oriented%20development">transit-oriented development</a>. Pro-cycling and environmentalist journalists in publications well beyond the <a href="Chicago%20metropolitan%20area">Chicago metropolitan area</a> have described the Cycle Center as exemplary, impressive, unique and ground-breaking.

Lying between <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Lake Michigan</a> to the east and <a href="Chicago%20Loop">the Loop</a> to the west, <a href="Grant%20Park%20%28Chicago%29">Grant Park</a> has been Chicago's "front yard" since the mid-19th century. Its northwest corner, north of Monroe Street and the <a href="Art%20Institute%20of%20Chicago">Art Institute</a>, east of <a href="Michigan%20Avenue%20%28Chicago%29">Michigan Avenue</a>, south of Randolph Street, and west of Columbus Drive, had been <a href="Illinois%20Central%20Railroad">Illinois Central</a> rail yards and parking lots until 1997, when it was made available for development by the city as <a href="Millennium%20Park">Millennium Park</a>. According to 2007 data released in 2008, Millennium Park trailed only <a href="Navy%20Pier">Navy Pier</a> as a Chicago tourist attraction.

The Millennium Park bicycle center was designed by David Steele of the architectural firm Muller & Muller, which won a $120,000 contract to design the station by <a href="Memorial%20Day">Memorial Day</a> 2004, and commenced the design in August 2003. This was at a time when bike stations were in place or being planned in several U.S. cities, such as <a href="Denver">Denver</a>, and, in <a href="California">California</a>, <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="Berkeley%2C%20California">Berkeley</a>, <a href="Long%20Beach%2C%20California">Long Beach</a> and <a href="Palo%20Alto%2C%20California">Palo Alto</a>. Developed at the time of "Bike 2010 Plan" discussions, the station was part of Mayor Daley's vision of Chicago as the most bicycle-friendly city in the United States. From the outset the plan was to have separate operators for the Cycle Center's rental and repair services, as well as its coffee and juice bar.

The bike station had originally been planned to occupy and cost $2 million, but when completed, the Cycle Center was and located on a larger exterior plaza. The final two-floor design cost $3.2 million, and a federal grant from the <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a> and the <a href="Federal%20Transit%20Administration">Federal Transit Administration</a> for projects that lessen traffic congestion and improve air quality funded its construction.

The Cycle Center was completed in June 2004 and the official opening occurred on July 19, 2004, the Monday following the Millennium Park's grand opening gala. Attendees for the ribbon cutting included Mayor Daley, CDOT Commissioner Miguel d'Escoto, <a href="Chicago%20Park%20District">Chicago Park District</a> General Superintendent Timothy Mitchell, and representatives from the Chicago Bike Federation, Public Building Commission, <a href="Chicago%20Police%20Department">Chicago Police Department</a>, and <a href="Chicago%20City%20Council">Chicago City Council</a>. Managed by the <a href="Chicago%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Chicago Department of Transportation</a> (CDOT), the Cycle Center is on the fifth and sixth floors of the Millennium Park parking garage.

Although bicycle centers were already common throughout Europe, Long Beach, California is credited with pioneering commuter-biking hubs offering valet parking, showers and repair services in the United States. As the concept grew, public agencies and private groups in other cities followed suit. The development of the Millennium Park Cycle Center was part of a reversal of bike disincentives stemming from "<a href="Boub%20v.%20Township%20of%20Wayne">Boub v. Township of Wayne</a>"—a 1998 <a href="Illinois%20Supreme%20Court">Illinois Supreme Court</a> ruling that bikes are "permitted" but not "intended" users of the roads, meaning that local governments have a limited responsibility to keep cyclists safe and that municipalities are immune from bicycle-injury lawsuits unless the street has been clearly marked as a bike route. The city has been actively accommodating cyclists since 1999 through the CDOT Bike Lane Project. At the time of the July 2004 Cycle Center opening, <a href="Illinois%20Senate">Illinois Senate</a> Bill 275, which would have removed the liability disincentive to add <a href="bike%20lane">bike lane</a>s, mark bike routes and give cyclists reasonable protection, was at issue. At the time, the city of Chicago had of bike lanes (with an additional forthcoming), in excess of 9,000 bike racks, and it had implemented a policy allowing bicycles on CTA trains (at all times excluding weekday morning and afternoon rush hours), CTA buses and Pace buses. In June 2005, Metra allowed a limited number of bicycles on trains during off-peak and weekend hours for the first time on a trial basis. By 2006, the city had of bike lanes. The planning emphasis in Chicago uses what is known as transit-oriented development, which encourages developers to include bicycle parking.

The structure was originally named the Millennium Park Bike Station, but in June 2006 McDonald's announced a $5 million grant to underwrite the operations of the Cycle Center for 50 years. The bike facility had been the last unsponsored component of Millennium Park. As part of the endowment, McDonald's agreed to be the sponsor of free summer <a href="physical%20fitness">physical fitness</a> programs such as <a href="yoga">yoga</a>, <a href="pilates">pilates</a>, and a variety of dance class sessions in Millennium Park for 10 years. McDonald's agreed not to use any of its traditional commercial signage such as the <a href="Golden%20Arches">Golden Arches</a>. The McDonald's sponsorship of the Cycle Center and park fitness activity came just a few months after Chicago was named the fattest city in America by "<a href="Men%27s%20Fitness">Men's Fitness</a>".

The Cycle Center is designed to encourage bicycle commuting to Millennium and <a href="Grant%20Park%20%28Chicago%29">Grant Parks</a> as well as to work and other nearby downtown locations, such as the Art Institute of Chicago. It represents two major initiatives by the mayor: to promote cycling and to make the city greener. By supporting cycling as an alternate form of transportation, it will help reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality and promote the health benefits of cycling.

The physical focal point of the Cycle Center is an <a href="Atrium%20%28architecture%29">atrium</a> that introduces the two lower levels of facilities and provides an aesthetic above-ground presence. The atrium, which has been praised by <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>-winning architecture critic <a href="Blair%20Kamin">Blair Kamin</a> more than once, has a sloping <a href="solar%20panel">solar panel</a>ed roof. The 120 solar panels produce 6.5 percent of the electricity supply required for the climate-controlled building. The Cycle Center has an opaque design, with thin steel frames for its main windows. The interior design uses <a href="stainless%20steel">stainless steel</a> and blond wood, and shade is produced by <a href="awning">awning</a>s.

The Cycle Center includes parking for up to 300 bikes, lockers, an Internet station, a cafe, bike rentals, bike repair and private stall showers. During business hours, the facility has 100 spaces set aside for first-come, first-served usage, but after hours the facility is limited to dues-paying members. In addition to the riders, the Chicago Police Lakefront Bicycle Patrol Unit is stationed at the Cycle Center. As the city's high-profile bicycle parking facility, it has served as a demonstration location for efforts to lobby for further bicycle accommodations for the <a href="Active%20Transportation%20Alliance">Active Transportation Alliance</a>, League of Illinois Bicyclists, and <a href="Illinois%20Lieutenant%20Governor">Illinois Lieutenant Governor</a> <a href="Pat%20Quinn%20%28politician%29">Pat Quinn</a>.

When the heated and <a href="air%20conditioned">air conditioned</a> McDonald's Cycle Center opened, bicycle parking facilities with amenities, which had first appeared in the U.S. on the <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast</a>, did not exist in the <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">Midwest</a>. When it opened in 2006 the bike station was one of the country's largest and most modern. The Cycle Center's bicycle parking facilities use high-capacity, two-tiered DoubleParker racks that accommodate more than twice as many bicycles per square foot as traditional bike racks. These racks were manufactured by Josta, a German manufacturer of bicycle parking systems and stands. The interior design was a joint collaboration between the city of Chicago, Josta, and Cycle-Safe, Inc. of <a href="Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan">Grand Rapids</a>, Michigan, which also produces lockers and racks for bicycles. The Chicago Park District runs the station, which has a full-time staff.

The Cycle Center is at 239 East Randolph Street (at Columbus Drive), and offers convenient connections to mass transit at the nearby <a href="Chicago%20Transit%20Authority">Chicago Transit Authority</a> hub, the <a href="McCormick%20Place%20Busway">McCormick Place Busway</a> and Metra trains at <a href="Millennium%20Station">Millennium Station</a>. For the annual series of festivals held in Grant Park, such as <a href="Lollapalooza">Lollapalooza</a> and <a href="Taste%20of%20Chicago">Taste of Chicago</a>, the McDonald's Cycle Center is complemented by the Chase Bike Valet at the corner of <a href="Lake%20Shore%20Drive">Lake Shore Drive</a> and Monroe Street, which is one block east of Millennium Park. <a href="Chase%20Bank">Chase Bank</a> and organizations such as the Active Transportation Alliance sponsor the Chase Bike Valet. The city and its Cycle Center are considered exemplary by other cities in pursuit of covered, secure bicycle parking near public transportation.

The Cycle Center offers a wide variety of services to its members, and is busiest on Monday and Tuesday mornings. Illinois residents are eligible for Cycle Center monthly or annual memberships, which provide access to the showers and lockers; allow participation in the shared bicycle program; and include discounts on bicycle services, accessories, <a href="I-GO">I-GO</a> <a href="car%20sharing">car sharing</a> membership, and City bike events. The Cycle Center is affiliated with, and provides free special-event valet bicycle service for events such as <a href="Bike%20The%20Drive">Bike The Drive</a>, <a href="L.A.T.E.%20Ride">L.A.T.E. Ride</a>, and <a href="Chicago%20Marathon">Chicago Marathon</a>. As part of their membership agreement, members cannot store perishables and illegal substances in the lockers.
In April 2005, the Cycle Center approached its 500-member capacity, and began a waiting list. Monthly membership was $15 and yearly membership was $90. When the Cycle Center was renamed in 2006, it had an approximate membership of 500 cyclists, who each paid dues of either $15 monthly or $99 annually. About 50,000 riders used the Cycle Center in its first two years. By 2007, the annual membership cost for those selected from the wait list was $20 per month or $149 per year. There are 240 lockers available to members. The Cycle Center has eight private stall showers, four each for men and women, that are equipped with an attached personal dressing area. The station has offered a nutritional <a href="continental%20breakfast">continental breakfast</a> including cereal, coffee, fruit, juice and yogurt.

The Cycle Center offers a wide variety of bicycle styles, models and accessories for hourly, daily, weekly or monthly rental. <a href="Bicycle%20helmet">Helmets</a>, locks, and trail maps are included with each rental. Deposits can be secured with a valid <a href="credit%20card">credit card</a> or <a href="driver%27s%20license">driver's license</a>. Children under 18 years old must have a parent or guardian for rentals. Among the types of rentals available are <a href="tagalong">tagalong</a>s, <a href="Toy%20wagon">wagon</a>s, <a href="tandem%20bicycle">tandem bicycle</a>s and <a href="inline%20skates">inline skates</a>, and discounts are available with online rentals. Bike Chicago manages the rentals at the Cycle Center, as well as at <a href="Navy%20Pier">Navy Pier</a>, <a href="North%20Avenue%20Beach">North Avenue Beach</a> and Foster Avenue Beach. The citywide rental network emulates those in cities such as Paris, where they have long been common. Showers and lockers were initially available to non-members for a $1 fee, but by 2009, the fee had been raised to $3. One hundred lockers are available to day users.

The Cycle Center's repair center offers full-time professional <a href="bicycle%20mechanic">bicycle mechanic</a>s from 10 am to 6 pm during the summer, between <a href="Memorial%20Day">Memorial Day</a> weekend and <a href="Labor%20Day">Labor Day</a> weekend inclusive, and part-time during the rest of the year. The repair center has tools available for those who want to <a href="Do%20it%20yourself">fix their bicycle themselves</a>. Repair services are deeply discounted.

The Cycle Center conducts two- to three-hour tours, with reservations dependent on the seasons. Tours include the <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Lake Michigan</a> lakefront, the North Side, the <a href="South%20Side%2C%20Chicago">South Side</a> and night-time sightseeing. Self-guided tours are also available. Reservations are recommended from April to August and are required during the rest of the year. In May 2006, regular tours were offered. The biking event Le Tour de Shore was held over 2 days in 2008. Starting at the Cycle Center, the event took riders near <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Lake Michigan</a>, through the <a href="Indiana%20Dunes%20National%20Lakeshore">Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore</a>, and along the backroads of both Indiana and Michigan. The <a href="Chicago%20Trolley%20Company">Chicago Trolley Company</a> takes bicyclists from the Cycle Center to the <a href="DuSable%20Museum%20of%20African%20American%20History">DuSable Museum of African American History</a> twice daily for the Presidential Bike tour, which starts on the South Side of Chicago. The bike tour travels to <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>'s home in the <a href="Kenwood%2C%20Chicago">Kenwood</a> <a href="Community%20areas%20in%20Chicago">community area</a>, the place of his and <a href="Michelle%20Obama">Michelle Obama</a>'s marriage and other culturally related destinations.

The "Chicago Tribune"'s architecture critic, Blair Kamin, gave the Cycle Center three stars (out of a possible four), described as a "gem" for the city and praised several elements of its detail. It has received accolades from numerous architecture and bicycling enthusiasts. Other "Tribune" writers have described the station as an "oasis for the urban cyclist" and reminiscent of "a hip health club". The "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a>" described it similarly, saying that it is a "jewel-like glass building" with "amenities of an upscale health club"; it quoted a cycling advocate who said "It's not heaven, but it's close". According to "<a href="The%20Plain%20Dealer">The Plain Dealer</a>", the Cycle Center is the United States' "best-known [bike] station", while "<a href="The%20Oregonian">The Oregonian</a>" describes it as "the ultimate in bicycle stations". "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" felt that the Cycle Center put Chicago over the top as the nation's most cycling-friendly city.

The Cycle Center avoided much of the controversy that beset most of Millennium Park by remaining open during the paid rental of a large portion of the park by <a href="Toyota">Toyota</a> on September 8, 2005. What proved more controversial were McDonald's claims that, since it is providing a healthier menu and fostering grade school <a href="physical%20education">physical education</a> in an effort to help its customers improve their health, sponsoring bicycle and exercise activity in the park augments the company's other initiatives. Longtime writer for the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" and current Tribune health and fitness reporter, Julie Deardorff, described the move as a continuation of the '"McDonaldization" of America' and as somewhat "insidious" because the company is making itself more prominent as the social sentiment is to move away from <a href="fast%20food">fast food</a>.

The Cycle Center has helped Chicago to become known as a cycling-friendly city. According to an article in "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" based on selections by the Adventure Cycling Association and "<a href="Bicycling%20%28magazine%29">Bicycling</a>" magazine, Chicago is one of the ten most cycling-friendly cities in the U.S. because of the Cycle Center and the Chicago Department of Transportation's Bicycle Program. The Cycle Center was featured in the <a href="Federal%20Transit%20Administration">Federal Transit Administration</a>'s April 2009 report to the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> on a new generation of innovative transit systems entitled "Reinventing Transit: American communities finding smarter, cleaner, faster transportation solutions". Cities as far away as <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, Australia, point to Chicago as an example of a city with cycling-friendly features because of the Cycle Center (they also used European cities such as <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> and <a href="Lyon">Lyon</a>, France, as well as U.S. cities such as <a href="Davis%2C%20California">Davis, California</a> and <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a> as examples). The <a href="Chicago%20Architecture%20Foundation">Chicago Architecture Foundation</a> awarded its 2004 Stein Ray & Harris Patron of the Year award in the governmental category to Millennium Park, specifically mentioning the bike station, Commissioner d'Escoto and the City of Chicago Department of Transportation, along with several other leaders responsible for the development of other park features.

HMS Alceste (1806)

HMS "Alceste was built at <a href="Rochefort%2C%20Charente-Maritime">Rochefort</a> in 1804 for the <a href="French%20Navy">French Navy</a> as Minerve", an <a href="Armide%20class%20frigate">"Armide"-class</a> <a href="frigate">frigate</a>. In the spring of 1806, prior to her capture, she engaged <a href="HMS%20Pallas%20%281804%29">HMS "Pallas"</a>, then under <a href="Thomas%20Cochrane%2C%2010th%20Earl%20of%20Dundonald">Lord Cochrane</a>. During the duel she ran aground but Cochrane had to abort his attack when French reinforcements appeared.

The British seized her in an action on 25 September 1806, and the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> took "Minerve" into service as "Alceste" in March 1807; "Alceste" then continued to serve throughout the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>. On <a href="Action%20of%2029%20November%201811">29 November 1811</a>, "Alceste" led a British squadron that captured a French military convoy carrying more than 200 cannon to <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a> in the Balkans. After this loss, <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> changed the direction of his planned eastward expansion in 1812 from the Balkans to Russia. The British historian James Henderson has suggested that the two events were linked, and may have changed the course of the war.

In 1814, "Alceste" was converted to a troopship and used to transport British soldiers to North America during the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>. Following the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281815%29">Treaty of Paris</a> in 1815, "Alceste" carried <a href="William%20Amherst%2C%201st%20Earl%20Amherst">Lord Amherst</a> on his 1816 diplomatic mission to China. On the return journey, she struck a reef in the <a href="Java%20Sea">Java Sea</a>; her wreck was subsequently plundered and burned by <a href="Malay%20%28ethnic%20group%29">Malayan</a> pirates.

"Alceste" was built to a design by <a href="Pierre-Jacques-Nicolas%20Rolland">Pierre Rolland</a> for the French Navy as "Minerve", an <a href="Armide%20class%20frigate">"Armide"-Class</a> frigate. Her construction began at <a href="Rochefort%2C%20Charente-Maritime">Rochefort</a> in May 1804, she was <a href="ship%20launching">launched</a> in September 1805 and finished that November. Measuring along her gundeck with a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a depth in the hold of ; she had a capacity of 1,097 tons burthen. When first fitted out, "Minerve" carried twenty-eight as her main battery and fourteen <a href="carronade">carronade</a>s on her quarter-deck; her forecastle had two <a href="Naval%20long%20gun">long guns</a> and two carronades.

"Minerve" was initially commanded by Capitaine Jaques Collet, entering service during the early days of the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Fourth%20Coalition">War of the Fourth Coalition</a> between Britain and her allies, and Napoleonic France. In April 1806 she was part of a squadron—under <a href="Contre-amiral">Contre-amiral</a> <a href="Zacharie%20Allemand">Zacharie Allemand</a> and comprising five <a href="ships-of-the-line">ships-of-the-line</a>, five <a href="frigates">frigates</a>, and four smaller vessels—anchored under the shore batteries of the <a href="%C3%8Ele-d%27Aix">Île-d'Aix</a> awaiting the opportunity to put to sea. The British knew the location of Allemand's squadron; on 25 April Admiral <a href="Edward%20Thornbrough">Edward Thornbrough</a>, sent the British frigate close to the Île-d'Aix to count the enemy vessels. Allemand ordered "Minerve" and three <a href="corvettes">corvettes</a>, <a href="French%20corvette%20Lynx%20%281804%29">"Lynx"</a>, <a href="French%20corvette%20Sylphe%20%281804%29">"Sylphe"</a>, and <a href="French%20corvette%20Palinure%20%281804%29">"Palinure"</a>, to meet the British frigate, leading to a skirmish in which no ship incurred much damage. Three other British vessels subsequently approached — the frigate , the 16-gun <a href="sloop-of-war">sloop</a> , and a <a href="Cutter%20%28boat%29%23Naval%20cutter">cutter</a> — and Capitaine Collet ended the engagement by sailing "Minerve" to a position under the shelter of the island's guns.

"Pallas" returned on 12 May with and a 16-gun ship-sloop, . Allemande despatched two large frigates and three corvettes; facing unfavourable winds, the British withdrew. Two days later, "Pallas" and "Kingfisher" came back and Allemande again ordered "Minerve", "Lynx", "Sylphe", and "Palinure" to chase Cochrane off. As a precaution, he also had two other large frigates, and , cleared for action and ready to go. Collett ordered his ships to set all sail in the hope of catching "Pallas" before she could escape, but Cochrane was in no hurry to leave and even attempted to draw the French on by backing his <a href="topsails">topsails</a> and slowing down. Once in range, "Pallas" opened fire, bringing down the topsail <a href="Yard%20%28sailing%29">yard</a> of one of the smaller vessels and then retreating into nearby <a href="shoals">shoals</a> with "Minerve" in pursuit. By 13:00 "Minerve" had come up on the leeward side of "Pallas", whereupon "Pallas" fired into her and closed with the intention of boarding. Just at that moment, "Minerve" hit a sandbank and "Pallas" crashed into her. The force of the collision, great enough to jolt "Pallas"s guns from their positions, did not prevent her from unleashing a devastating broadside. Both ships were damaged but "Pallas"s shallower draught prevented her grounding. Her crew were able to disengage and get back under way, having seen the two 40-gun French frigates, "Armide" and "Infatigable", drawing near. The crew of "Kingfisher" sailed in to take "Pallas" in tow; the latter had lost her fore topmast, <a href="jib-boom">jib-boom</a>, <a href="spritsail">spritsail</a>, <a href="stunsail">stunsail</a>, and main topsail yards. "Minerve" was only lightly damaged; she was re-floated and taken to Rochefort for repair. The engagement cost the lives of seven seamen aboard "Minerve", with a further fourteen injured. There were a further one dead and five wounded aboard "Pallas".

By September 1806 "Minerve" had joined a squadron — along with the large frigates "Armide", , "Infatigable", and , and the brig-corvettes "Lynx" and "Sylphe" — under Eléon-Jean-Nicolas Soleil. The squadron left Rochefort on 24 September 1806, bound for the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a>. At 01:00 on 25 September Soleil's squadron were spotted near the Chassiron lighthouse by a powerful British force under <a href="Sir%20Samuel%20Hood%2C%201st%20Baronet">Samuel Hood</a>, comprising five 74-gun ships (, , , , and ), the 98-gun , and the 16-gun brig . The French sought to avoid engagement, turning to the south-south-west with the British in <a href="general%20chase">general pursuit</a>. After three hours the fastest British ship, "Monarch", was within range of "Armide". The next nearest British ship was "Centaur", over eight miles further back; seeing an opportunity, four of the French frigates fled. "Infatigable", set off north but was pursued and later caught by "Mars"; "Thémis" and the two brigs headed south and eventually escaped.

The remaining French frigates closed-up for mutual protection. At 10:00, "Monarch" engaged "Minerve" and "Armide", as the weather prevented "Monarch" from opening her lower gun ports, she was badly mauled. An hour later, "Centaur" caught up and began firing at "Armide" and "Gloire", leaving "Monarch" to continue her fight with "Minerve". "Armide" <a href="Striking%20the%20colours">struck</a> to "Centaur" at 11:45 and "Minerve" surrendered to "Monarch" shortly after. "Gloire" veered west in an attempt to throw her pursuers but "Centaur" and "Mars" chased her down and forced her to strike at 15:00.

The captured "Minerve" arrived at <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> on 26 October 1806, and after languishing there for some months, was taken into service as HMS "Alceste". Commissioned in March 1807 under Captain <a href="Murray%20Maxwell">Murray Maxwell</a> and refitted between April and August, she was sent to the Mediterranean in December. Following the French invasion of Portugal in November 1807, a British expedition to capture the island of <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a> was proposed. Admiral Samuel Hood's squadron — comprising ships-of-the-line, "Centaur", , and , and the frigates "Alceste", <a href="French%20frigate%20Africaine%20%281798%29">"Africaine"</a>, , and — escorted troopships into <a href="Funchal%20Bay">Funchal Bay</a> on 24 December. The island was peacefully occupied two days later.

In the <a href="Action%20of%204%20April%201808">Action of 4 April 1808</a>, "Alceste", with and , attacked a Spanish convoy off <a href="Rota%2C%20Spain">Rota</a>. While at anchor about three miles to the north-west of the <a href="San%20Sebasti%C3%A1n">San Sebastián</a> lighthouse, the British ships noticed the large convoy, escorted by 20 gun-boats and sailing close to the land so as to also benefit from the protection of a mobile artillery following on the shore. Coming under heavy fire, the three ships closed with the convoy at around 16:00. "Grasshopper", requiring less water than the frigates, was able to stand in close to the town and bombard the batteries there, while "Alceste" and "Mercury" concentrated their fire on the gun-boats, destroying two of the escorts and driving many of the merchants ashore. Seven were subsequently captured and sailed back out to sea by marines and sailors of the British ships.

In 1808, with <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> controlling much of Europe, a plan was conceived by <a href="Robert%20Adair%20%28politician%29">Sir Robert Adair</a>, ambassador to Venice, to extract <a href="Pope">Pope</a> <a href="Pope%20Pius%20VII">Pius VII</a> from <a href="Rome">Rome</a>. It was thought that the Pope in exile could encourage the Catholic countries of Spain and Italy to rise up against Napoleon. <a href="Cuthbert%20Collingwood%2C%201st%20Baron%20Collingwood">Admiral Collingwood</a>, Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, dispatched "Alceste" and an 18-gun sloop, , to <a href="Palermo">Palermo</a> where they arrived on 12 August. The British diplomat there, <a href="William%20Drummond%20of%20Logiealmond">William Drummond</a>, selected four priests willing to undertake the mission. They boarded "Alceste" and set sail on 26 August.
On 31 August boats from "Alceste" put the party ashore at <a href="Ostia%20%28Rome%29">Ostia</a>, near Rome, where they made contact with a representative of the <a href="Holy%20See">Vatican</a> who agreed to speak to the Pope but failed to return. When it was deemed necessary to travel to Rome to re-establish contact, the priests refused to go. Maxwell sent them back to Palermo in "Acorn", which returned a week later with another volunteer of Drummond's. Landed on the night of 19 September, the envoy was captured and shot as a spy the following day. Consequently, the entire plan was abandoned.

On 22 May 1810, "Alceste" encountered some French <a href="felucca">felucca</a>s — lightly-armed merchant vessels with <a href="lateen%20rig">lateen rig</a>s — that were forced to seek refuge under the guns of the bay of Agay. Under cover of darkness, two boats from "Alceste", one under Lieutenant Andrew Wilson, the other led by the ship's master, Henry Bell, attacked the shore batteries. This was only partially successful; Wilson was unable to achieve his objective, while Bell's section managed to spike the guns of the second battery but only after taking heavy fire. "Alceste" stood out to sea for three days, and on the night of 25 May, Maxwell sent two armed boats to lay in wait in a rocky cove. The following morning "Alceste" set sail. The French, assuming "Alceste" had gone, attempted to leave, but the two British boats lying in ambush attacked. Despite fierce resistance and fire from the guns on shore, four ships of the French convoy were captured and two driven on to the rocks. The remainder made it safely back to their anchorage.

Boats of "Alceste" and captured two vessels in the bay of Martino, <a href="Corsica">Corsica</a> on 21 June 1810. Protecting the entrance to the bay was a three-gun <a href="artillery%20battery">battery</a>, which a landing party captured and put out of action. Several of the garrison were wounded or killed during the attack. British casualties amounted to one killed and two wounded.

In 1811, "Alceste" entered the <a href="Adriatic">Adriatic</a> and on 4–5 May, she and <a href="HMS%20Belle%20Poule%20%281806%29">"Belle Poule"</a> participated in a raid at <a href="Pore%C4%8D">Parenza</a>, (<a href="Istria">Istria</a>). Having chased a brig into the harbour, but unable to follow due to the rocks and shallow water, the two frigates stood outside and opened fire on her and the battery protecting her. After an hour, the brig was forced to move nearer the shore, out of range. At 23:00, the British landed 200 seamen and all their marines on an island nearby, and also landed two 9-pounders and two <a href="howitzer">howitzer</a>s that they placed in one battery, and a field piece that they placed further away. From there, they were able to engage the French in Parenza in a five-hour mutual bombardment. The brig was eventually destroyed and the men and cannons returned to their ships. "Belle Poule" had one man killed and three wounded, and "Alceste" had two men killed during the action. All casualties occurred ashore.

At the <a href="Action%20of%2029%20November%201811">Action of 29 November 1811</a>, "Alceste" led the British frigate squadron that outran and defeated a French military convoy carrying a cargo of cannon. The day before, "Alceste" had been stationed at the island of <a href="Vis%20%28island%29">Lissa</a> (now Vis), with the frigates <a href="HMS%20Imperieuse%20%281793%29">"Unité"</a> and <a href="HMS%20Active%20%281799%29">"Active"</a>, when word was received of a similar sized French squadron heading north. The British frigates could not immediately set sail because Maxwell feared an attack from a strong French force nearby. As a defence, he placed two batteries on an island in the harbour's entrance, manned by the ships' marines, and three previously captured gun-boats manned by around 30 seamen from "Alceste" and "Active". These precautions not only weakened but delayed Maxwell's squadron, which put to sea at 19:00, twelve hours later.

The British eventually caught up with the French ships at 10:00 the following morning, identifying them as the two large frigates and , and the smaller . "Persanne", fired the first shots at 12:30, off the coast of <a href="Palagru%C5%BEa">Pelagosa</a> (Palagruža); an hour later "Alceste" and "Pomone" exchanged shots from their bow and stern guns respectively. "Alceste" began to overhaul "Pomone" at 13:40 and fired a broadside into her while simultaneously spreading more sail in the hope of catching "Pauline", a little further ahead. This plan was thwarted though when a shot from "Pomone" brought down "Alceste"s main topmast, slowing her suddenly. When "Active" arrived at 14:00 and also started firing into "Pomone", "Pauline" was obliged to come about to protect her now out-gunned colleague. Just after 15:00 the British sloop, "Kingfisher" appeared on the horizon and "Pauline", now in danger of capture herself, disengaged and sailed off. "Pomone" struck shortly after. "Unité" which had set off in pursuit of "Persanne", forced "Persanne" to surrender at 16:00 after a single exchange of broadsides.

The captured frigates contained more than 200 cannon, which were being transported to <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a>, a city in north-east Italy on the border of the <a href="Balkans">Balkan States</a>. It has been suggested by the British historian James Henderson that this action was a factor in Napoleon's decision to change the direction of his planned eastward expansion in 1812 from the Balkans to Russia.

In late 1812, "Alceste" was decommissioned and placed <a href="reserve%20fleet">in ordinary</a> at Deptford. Between February and July 1814 she was converted at Deptford into a <a href="troopship">troopship</a>; in this role, she was recommissioned in May 1814 under Commander Faniel Lawrence, and sailed with troops to <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. Following the British decision to attack <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>; "Alceste" left <a href="Pensacola">Pensacola</a> on 8 December 1814, in tandem with the 50 other vessels under Vice-Admiral <a href="Alexander%20Cochrane">Alexander Cochrane</a>. The point chosen to land the troops was at the head of <a href="Lake%20Borgne">Lake Borgne</a> which was subsequently discovered to be guarded by five American gunboats, a sloop and a schooner. On 14 December, Cochrane dispatched nearly 1,000 men in 42 barges from the various ships under his command, including "Alceste". After rowing for almost 24 hours, the British stopped just out of range to rest and eat breakfast before launching their attack. The conflict, known as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lake%20Borgne">Battle of Lake Borgne</a>, resulted in the capture of all the American vessels, at a cost of 94 British and 41 American dead and wounded.

After the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281815%29">Treaty of Paris</a>, the <a href="Government%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British government</a> sought stronger ties with <a href="China">China</a>. <a href="William%20Amherst%2C%201st%20Earl%20Amherst">William Amherst</a>, the diplomat chosen to inform the <a href="Jiaqing%20Emperor">emperor</a> of the peace in Europe and to offer Britain's friendship, specifically requested Maxwell and "Alceste" to accompany him. Maxwell, without a ship since <a href="HMS%20Daedalus%20%281811%29">HMS "Daedalus"</a> was wrecked three years before, commissioned "Alceste" at the beginning of 1816. The journey out was uneventful; "Alceste" left <a href="Spithead">Spithead</a> for China on 9 February with Amherst aboard, and after stopping at Madeira, <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>, the <a href="Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a>, <a href="Anyer">Anyer</a>, and <a href="Jakarta">Batavia</a>, sailed through the <a href="Bangka%20Strait">Bangka Strait</a> into the <a href="South%20China%20Sea">South China Sea</a>. After calling to pay respects at <a href="Guangzhou">Canton</a>, "Alceste" transited the <a href="Taiwan%20Strait">Straits of Formosa</a> and hove-to in the <a href="Bohai%20Sea">Bohai Sea</a> on 28 July. There she met the 10-gun <a href="brig-sloop">brig-sloop</a>, <a href="HMS%20Lyra%20%281810%29">"Lyra"</a>, despatched earlier to herald the arrival of Britain's ambassador.

Having arranged to travel back overland from <a href="Peking">Peking</a> to rendezvous with "Alceste" at Canton, Amherst was ferried to the mouth of the <a href="Hai%20River">Hai River</a> on 9 August. As the mission and return journey would take several weeks, Maxwell had an opportunity to explore the area. "Alceste" headed north, while "Lyra", under the command of Lieutenant <a href="Basil%20Hall">Basil Hall</a>, was sent south. <a href="General%20Hewett%20%281811%20ship%29">"General Hewitt"</a>, an <a href="East%20Indiaman">East Indiaman</a> chartered to carry gifts for the Emperor of China, was to explore the centre channel. "Alceste" first undertook a survey of the <a href="Liaodong%20Bay">Gulf of Liaodong</a>, at that time virtually unknown to Europeans, and after spending some time exploring the <a href="Liaodong%20Peninsula">Liaodong Peninsula</a>, proceeded southward to <a href="Jiaozhou%20Bay">Jiaozhou Bay</a> on the coast of <a href="Shandong">Shandong</a>, where she encountered "General Hewitt", and was later joined by Hall in "Lyra". "Alceste" and "Lyra" left the bay on 29 August for the west coast of <a href="Korea">Korea</a>, an area that had not been surveyed since the <a href="Jesuit%20China%20missions">Jesuit missionaries</a> visited in the 16th and 17th centuries. Maxwell found the Korean coast to be some 130 miles further east than expected, and in the process of exploration also discovered the <a href="Korean%20archipelago">archipelago</a> that forms the south-western tip of the Korean peninsula. "Alceste" was then turned towards the Loo Choo Islands, now known as the <a href="Ryukyu%20Islands">Ryukyu archipelago</a>, dropping anchor in the Napakiang roads on the south-west side of <a href="Okinawa%20Island">Okinawa</a> on 16 September 1816. After a six-week stay, "Alceste" returned to China via the southern end of the island of <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>, arriving at the mouth of the <a href="Pearl%20River%20%28China%29">Pearl River</a> on 2 November.

"Alceste" required some repairs after a long journey in inclement weather so Maxwell petitioned the <a href="Viceroys%20in%20China">viceroy</a> of Canton for permission to travel up the <a href="Bocca%20Tigris">Tigris</a> to a secure anchorage, unaware that Amherst's mission had been unsuccessful. The emperor's attitude towards the British envoy had been off-hand; he showed little interest in Europe or its affairs, and refused a gift from <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George</a> as he considered it insufficient. Having received an insulting message in response to his request, Maxwell decided to enter the river regardless but was soon hailed by a local <a href="Mandarin%20%28bureaucrat%29">mandarin</a> who threatened to have the batteries guarding the entrance sink "Alceste" if she went any further. Still in need of repairs and requiring navigation to <a href="Whampoa%20anchorage">Whampoa</a> to collect Amherst, Maxwell told the mandarin that he would proceed in any event. "Alceste" quickly dealt with the shore defences and 17 war-junks sent to stop her, and continued up the river to Whampoa. There she anchored and received fresh supplies while awaiting the arrival of Amherst and his suite. The incident would later be publicly described as, ""A friendly interchange of salutes"". Having completed as much of his mission as possible, Amherst boarded "Alceste" which left Whampoa on 21 January 1817.

With the many uncharted shoals and reefs, and frequent storms, the South China Seas remain some of the most dangerous waters in the world. Despite the continual use of a sounding lead, on 18 February 1817, "Alceste" grounded on one of the many hidden reefs in the <a href="Java%20Sea">Java Sea</a>. Maxwell ordered the anchor dropped to prevent the ship from slipping into deeper water, an undesirable situation if the hull had been breached, which turned out to be the case. The pumps were unable to cope with the influx of water and the ship's carpenter, Cheffy, reported that "Alceste" was beyond repair.

Maxwell ordered his first lieutenant, <a href="Henry%20Parkyns%20Hoppner">Henry Parkyns Hoppner</a>, to take Lord Amherst and his party in two of the boats to an island, known today as <a href="Pulo%20Leat">Pulo Leat</a>, three miles away. The island's thick vegetation prevented an assessment of whether it was inhabited, and forced the boat crews to row a further three miles along the shore before finding a suitable landing spot between the mangroves. The rest of the ship's company were evacuated in the remaining boats and a large raft. Because of the lack of provisions, in particular drinking water, it was decided that Hoppner would continue with Amherst and his embassy to Java, roughly 200 miles to the south. Once there, a rescue could be initiated.

Hoppner's return journey to Java could not be accomplished in less than nine days, so further supplies would be required for the 200 remaining survivors. An unarmed expedition made its way back to "Alceste" to see what could be salvaged, but was forced back by the arrival of <a href="Malays%20%28ethnic%20group%29">Malay</a> <a href="Dayak%20people">Dyak</a> pirates who plundered the wreck. Maxwell ordered the construction of a stockade and the improvisation of additional weapons to counter the threat of an attack. The digging of a well solved the problem of water. On 22 February, an armed party set out to reclaim the ship but the pirates set fire to "Alceste" and made off. The fire lasted throughout the night and destroyed the wreck; the following morning Maxwell sent out a boat that managed to retrieve some barrels of flour, cases of wine, and a cask of ale. The pirates returned at dawn on 26 February, entering the cove aboard two <a href="proa">proa</a>s and two <a href="canoe">canoe</a>s. Second lieutenant Hay led a sortie that boarded one of the proas, killing four pirates and capturing two more. The proa could not be brought to shore and was scuttled. More pirates arrived over the next two days. They made no attempt to land, but behaved aggressively by firing their <a href="swivel%20gun">swivel gun</a>s towards the shore. By 1 March there were fourteen pirate proas in the cove, with more arriving on the following night.

Provisions were now running low, and with the rescue mission overdue, Maxwell began formulating a plan to capture sufficient proas to escape from the island. While the plan was being proposed a sail was spotted on the horizon, heading toward the island. The appearance of this vessel, coupled with a sudden attack spearheaded by "Alceste's" <a href="Royal%20Marines">marines</a>, caused the pirates to flee. The rescue ship was <a href="Ternate%20%281801%20ship%29">"Ternate"</a>, a 16-gun brig belonging to the British <a href="East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a>'s navy, the <a href="Bombay%20Marine">Bombay Marine</a>, despatched by Lord Amherst on the day of his arrival in Batavia.

"Ternate" returned to Batavia with the castaways, where Amherst chartered the ship <a href="Caesar%20%281810%20ship%29">"Caesar"</a> for the journey to England. During a stop at <a href="St%20Helena">St Helena</a>, Maxwell met Napoleon, who remembered the action on 29 November 1811 when "Alceste" had captured "La Pomone", and remarked, "... your government must not blame you for the loss of "Alceste", for you have taken one of my frigates." The requisite court martial exonerated Maxwell, his officers, and his crew of the loss of "Alceste". Maxwell received much praise for his actions, and £1500 from the East India Company. He was knighted in 1818.

Battle of Lissa (1811)

The Battle of Lissa (sometimes called the Battle of Vis; ; ; ) was a naval action fought between a British <a href="frigate">frigate</a> squadron and a larger squadron of French and Italian frigates and smaller ships on 13 March 1811 during the <a href="Adriatic%20campaign%20of%201807%E2%80%931814">Adriatic campaign</a> of the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>. The engagement was fought in the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic Sea</a> for possession of the strategically important island of <a href="Vis%20%28island%29">Lissa</a> (also known as Vis), from which the British squadron had been disrupting French shipping in the Adriatic. The French needed to control the Adriatic to supply a growing army in the <a href="Illyrian%20Provinces">Illyrian Provinces</a>, and consequently dispatched an invasion force in March 1811 consisting of six frigates, numerous smaller craft and a battalion of Italian soldiers.

The French invasion force under <a href="Bernard%20Dubourdieu">Bernard Dubourdieu</a> was met by Captain <a href="William%20Hoste">William Hoste</a> and his four ships based on the island. In the subsequent battle, Hoste sank the French flagship, captured two others, and scattered the remainder of the Franco-Venetian squadron. The battle has been hailed as an important British victory, due to both the disparity between the forces and the signal raised by Hoste, a former subordinate of <a href="Horatio%20Nelson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Nelson">Horatio Nelson</a>. Hoste had raised the message "Remember Nelson" as the French bore down, and had then manoeuvred to drive Dubourdieu's flagship ashore and scatter his squadron in what has been described as "one of the most brilliant naval achievements of the war".

The <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, the name for a succession of connected conflicts between the armies of the French Emperor <a href="Napoleon%20I%20of%20France">Napoleon</a> and his European opponents, were nine years old when the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Fifth%20Coalition">War of the Fifth Coalition</a> ended in 1809. The <a href="Treaty%20of%20Sch%C3%B6nbrunn">Treaty of Schönbrunn</a> that followed the war gave Napoleon possession of the final part of Adriatic coastline not under his control: the <a href="Illyrian%20Provinces">Illyrian Provinces</a>. This formalised the control the French had exercised in Illyria since 1805 and over the whole <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic Sea</a> since the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Tilsit">Treaty of Tilsit</a> in 1807. In the Treaty of Tilsit, <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russia</a> had granted France control over the <a href="Septinsular%20Republic">Septinsular Republic</a> and withdrawn their own forces from the region, allowing Napoleon freedom of action in the Adriatic. At Schönbrunn, Napoleon made the Illyrian Provinces part of metropolitan <a href="France">France</a> and therefore under direct French rule, unlike the neighbouring <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy%20%28Napoleonic%29">Kingdom of Italy</a> which was nominally independent but in reality came under his personal rule. Thus, the Treaty of Schönbrunn formalised Napoleon's control of almost the entire coastline of the Adriatic and, if unopposed, would allow him to transport troops and supplies to the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>. The French army forming in the Illyrian Provinces was possibly intended for an invasion of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> in conjunction with the Russians; the two countries had signed an agreement to support one another against the Ottomans at Tilsit.

To disrupt the preparations of this army, the British <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, which had controlled most of the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a> since the <a href="Battle%20of%20Trafalgar">Battle of Trafalgar</a> in 1805, seized the Dalmatian Island of <a href="Vis%20%28island%29">Lissa</a> in 1807 and used it as a base for raiding the coastal shipping of Italy and Illyria. These operations captured dozens of ships and caused panic and disruption to French strategy in the region. To counter this, the French government started a major shipbuilding programme in the Italian seaports, particularly <a href="Venice">Venice</a>, and despatched frigates of their own to protect their shipping. Commodore <a href="Bernard%20Dubourdieu">Bernard Dubourdieu</a>'s Franco-Venetian forces were unable to bring the smaller British force under <a href="William%20Hoste">William Hoste</a> to a concerted action, where Dubourdieu's superior numbers might prove decisive. Instead, the British and French frigate squadrons engaged in a campaign of raids and counter-raids during 1810.

In October 1810, Dubourdieu landed 700 Italian soldiers on Lissa while Hoste searched in vain for the French squadron in the Southern Adriatic. The island had been left in the command of two <a href="midshipmen">midshipmen</a>, James Lew and Robert Kingston, who withdrew the entire population of the island into the central mountains along with their supplies. The Italian troops were left in possession of the deserted main town, <a href="Vis%20%28town%29">Port St. George</a>. The French and Italians burnt several vessels in the harbour and captured others, but remained on the island for no more than seven hours, retreating before Hoste returned. The remainder of the year was quiet, the British squadron gaining superiority after being reinforced by the <a href="third-rate">third-rate</a> <a href="ship%20of%20the%20line">ship of the line</a> <a href="HMS%20Montagu%20%281779%29">HMS "Montagu"</a>.

Early in 1811 the raiding campaigns began again, and British attacks along the Italian coast prompted Dubourdieu to mount a second invasion of Lissa. Taking advantage of the temporary absence of "Montagu", Dubourdieu assembled six frigates and numerous smaller craft and embarked over 500 Italian soldiers under Colonel Alexander Gifflenga. The squadron amassed by Dubourdieu not only outnumbered the British in terms of men and ships, it was also twice as heavy in weight of shot. Dubourdieu planned to overwhelm Hoste's frigate squadron and then invade and capture the island, which would eradicate the British threat in the Adriatic for months to come.

Dubourdieu (as <a href="Commodore%20%28rank%29">commodore</a>) led a squadron consisting of six <a href="frigate">frigate</a>s (four of 40 guns and two of 32 guns), a 16-gun <a href="brig">brig</a>, two <a href="schooner">schooner</a>s, one <a href="xebec">xebec</a>, and two <a href="gunboat">gunboat</a>s. Three of his ships were from the <a href="French%20Navy">French Navy</a>, and the others from the Navy of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy%20%28Napoleonic%29">Kingdom of Italy</a>. In addition the squadron carried 500 Italian soldiers. In the absence of "Montagu", Hoste's squadron consisted of three frigates (one of 38 guns and two of 32 guns) and one 22-gun <a href="post%20ship">post ship</a>. The island of Lissa itself was defended by a small number of local troops under the command of two <a href="midshipmen">midshipmen</a>.

Dubourdieu's squadron was spotted approaching the island of Lissa at 03:00 on 12 March 1811 by Captain Gordon in <a href="HMS%20Active%20%281799%29">HMS "Active"</a>, which had led the British squadron from <a href="Vis%20%28town%29">Port St George</a> on a cruise off Ancona. Turning west, the British squadron awaited the French approach in line ahead, sailing along the north coast of the island within half a mile of the shoreline. By 06:00, Dubourdieu was approaching the British line from the north-east in two divisions, leading in <a href="French%20frigate%20Favorite%20%281810%29">"Favorite"</a> at the head of the windward or western division. Dubourdieu hoped to pass ahead of "Active" at the head of the British line and cross it further east with <a href="French%20frigate%20Dana%C3%A9%20%281807%29">"Danaé"</a>, which led the leeward division. Dubourdieu intended to break the British line in two places and destroy the British squadron in the crossfire.
Over the next three hours the squadrons continued to close, light winds restricting them to a little over three <a href="Knot%20%28unit%29">knots</a>. A protege of Nelson, Hoste recalled the inspirational effect of <a href="England%20expects%20that%20every%20man%20will%20do%20his%20duty">Nelson's signal</a> before the <a href="Battle%20of%20Trafalgar">Battle of Trafalgar</a> and raised his own: "Remember Nelson", which was greeted with wild cheering from the squadron. As he closed with Hoste's force, Dubourdieu realised that he would be unable to successfully cross "Active's" bow due to the British ship's speed, and would also be unable to break through their line due to the British ships' close proximity to one another. He instead sought to attack the second ship in the British line, Hoste's flagship <a href="HMS%20Amphion%20%281799%29">HMS "Amphion"</a>. Dubourdieu possessed not only a significant advantage in ships but also in men, the Italian soldiers aboard giving him the opportunity to overwhelm the British crews if he could board their frigates successfully. The first shots of the battle were fired at 09:00, as the British used their wider field of fire to attack the leading French ships, "Favorite" and "Danaé", unopposed for several minutes. The French squadron held their fire, Dubourdieu gathering his troops and sailors into "Favorite"'s bow in order to maximise the effect of his initial attack once his flagship came into contact with "Amphion".

Hoste was aware of Dubourdieu's intentions and the French advantage in numbers, and consequently ordered a large <a href="howitzer">howitzer</a> on "Amphion's" deck <a href="Naval%20artillery%20in%20the%20Age%20of%20Sail%23Shot">triple-shotted</a> until the cannon contained over 750 <a href="Musket%23Ammunition">musket balls</a> Once "Favorite" was within a few yards of "Amphion"'s stern, Hoste gave permission for the gun to be fired and the cannon's discharge instantly swept the bow of "Favorite" clear of the French and Italian boarding party. Among the dozens killed and wounded were Dubourdieu and all the frigate's officers, leaving Colonel Gifflenga in command of "Favorite". As "Favorite" and "Amphion" closed with one another, firing continued between the British rear and the French leeward division, led by "Danaé". Several of the French ships came at an angle at which they could bring their guns to bear on <a href="HMS%20Cerberus%20%281794%29">HMS "Cerberus"</a>, the rearmost British ship, and both sides were firing regular broadsides at one another.

Following the death of Dubourdieu, Captain Péridier on <a href="French%20frigate%20Flore%20%281806%29">"Flore"</a> ordered the French and Venetian ships to attack the British line directly. The battered "Favorite" led with an attempt to round "Amphion" and <a href="Raking%20fire">rake</a> her before catching her in crossfire, as had been Dubourdieu's original intention. The remainder of the Franco-Venetian squadron followed this lead and attempted to bring their superior numbers to bear on the British squadron. Hoste was prepared for this eventuality and immediately ordered his ships to <a href="Jibe">wear</a>, turning south and then east to reverse direction. This movement threw the Franco-Venetian squadron into confusion and as a result the squadron's formation became disorganised. "Favorite", which had lost almost its entire complement of officers, was unable to respond quickly enough to the manoeuvre and drove onto the rocky coastline in confusion, becoming a total wreck.

Thrown into further confusion by the loss of "Favorite", the French and Venetian formation began to break up and the British squadron was able to pull ahead of their opponents; the leading French ships "Flore" and "Bellona" succeeded in only reaching "Amphion", which was now at the rear of the British line. "Amphion" found herself caught between the two frigates and this slowed the British line enough that the French eastern division, led by "Danaé", was able to strike at <a href="HMS%20Volage%20%281807%29">HMS "Volage"</a>, now the leading British ship after overtaking "Cerberus" during the turn. "Volage" was much smaller than her opponent but was armed with 32-pounder <a href="carronade">carronade</a>s, short range guns that caused such damage to "Danaé" that the French ship was forced to haul off and reengage from a longer range. The strain of combat at this greater distance ruptured "Volage's" short-ranged carronades and left the ship much weakened, with only a single gun with which to engage the enemy.

Behind "Volage" and "Danaé", the Venetian "Corona" had engaged "Cerberus" in a close range duel, during which "Cerberus" took heavy damage but inflicted similar injuries on the Italian ship. This exchange continued until the arrival of "Active" caused the "Danaé", "Corona" and "Carolina" to sheer off and retreat to the east. To the rear, "Amphion" succeeded in closing with and raking "Flore", and caused such damage that within five minutes the French ship's officers threw the <a href="French%20tricolour">French colours</a> overboard in surrender. Captain Péridier had been seriously wounded in the action, and took no part in "Flore"'s later movements. "Amphion" then attacked "Bellona" and in an engagement that lasted until 12:00, forced the Italian ship's surrender. During this combat, the small ship "Principessa Augusta" fired on "Amphion" from a distance, until the frigate was able to turn a gun on them and drive them off. Hoste sent a <a href="punt%20%28boat%29">punt</a> to take possession of "Bellona" but due to the damage suffered was unable to launch a boat to seize "Flore". Realising "Amphion's" difficulty, the officers of "Flore", who had made hasty repairs during the conflict between "Amphion" and "Bellona", immediately set sail for the French harbour on <a href="Hvar">Lesina</a> (Hvar), despite having already surrendered.

"Active", the only British ship still in fighting condition, took up pursuit of the retreating enemy and at 12:30 caught the "Corona" in the channel between Lissa and the small island of Spalmadon. The frigates manoeuvred around one another for the next hour; captains Gordon and Pasqualigo each seeking the best position from which to engage. The frigates engaged in combat at 13.45, "Active" forcing "Corona"'s surrender 45 minutes later after a fire broke out aboard the Italian ship. "Active" too had suffered severely and as the British squadron was not strong enough to continue the action by attacking the remaining squadron in its protected harbour on Lesina, the battle came to an end. The survivors of the Franco-Venetian squadron had all reached safety; "Carolina" and "Danaé" had used the conflict between "Active" and "Corona" to cover their escape while "Flore" had indicated to each British ship she passed that she had surrendered and was in British possession despite the absence of a British officer on board. Once "Flore" was clear of the British squadron she headed for safety, reaching the batteries of Lesina shortly after her "Carolina" and "Danaé" and ahead of the limping British pursuit. The smaller craft of the Franco-Venetian squadron scattered during the battle's final stages and reached Lesina independently.

Although "Favorite" was wrecked, over 200 of her crew and soldier-passengers had reached the land and, having set fire to their ship, prepared to march on Port St. George under the leadership of Colonel Gifflenga. Two British midshipmen left in command of the town organised the British and indigenous population into a defensive force and marched to meet Gifflenga. The junior British officers informed Gifflenga that the return of the British squadron would bring overwhelming numbers of sailors, marines and naval artillery to bear on his small force and that if he surrendered immediately he could expect better terms. Gifflenga recognised that his position was untenable and capitulated. At Port St. George, the Venetian gunboat "Lodola" sneaked unnoticed into the harbour and almost captured a Sicilian privateer, "Vincitore". The raider was driven off by the remaining garrison of the town without the prize, while attempting to manoeuvre her out of the bay.

In the seas off Lissa, British prize crews were making strenuous efforts to protect their captures; "Corona" was heavily on fire in consequence of her engagement with "Active" and the British prize crew fought the blaze alongside their Italian prisoners. The fire was eventually brought under control, but not without the death of five men and several more seriously burnt when the blazing mainmast collapsed. Problems were also experienced aboard "Bellona", where Captain Duodo planned to ignite the powder magazine and destroy the ship following its surrender. Duodo had been mortally wounded in the action, and so ordered his second in command to light the fuse. The officer promised to do so, but instead handed control of the magazine to the British prize crew when they arrived. Duodo died still believing that the fuse had been lit.

Hoste also remained at sea, cruising in the battered "Amphion" beyond the range of the shore batteries on Lesina. Hoste was furious at the behaviour of "Flore's" officers and sent a note into Lesina demanding that they give up the ship as indicated by its earlier surrender. In surrendering and then escaping, the officers of "Flore" had breached an informal rule of naval conflict under which a ship that voluntarily struck its flag submitted to an opponent in order to prevent continued loss of life among its crew. "Flore" had been able to pass unmolested through the British squadron only because she was recognised to have surrendered, and to abuse this custom in this way was considered, in the Royal Navy especially, to be a dishonourable act. The French at Lesina did not respond to Hoste's note, and the British squadron was eventually forced to return to Lissa to effect repairs.

Casualties of the action were heavy on both sides. The British ships suffered 190 killed or wounded in the battle and a number lost afterwards in the fire aboard "Corona". Captains Hoste and Hornby were both badly wounded and the entire British squadron was in need of urgent repair before resuming the campaign. In the French and Italian squadron the situation was even worse, although precise losses are not known. At least 150 had been killed aboard "Favorite" either in the action or the wreck, and the 200 survivors of her crew and passengers were all made prisoner. "Bellona" had suffered at least 70 casualties and "Corona's" losses were also severe. Among the ships that escaped less is known of their casualties, but all required repair and reinforcement before the campaign could resume. Total French and Italian losses are estimated at no less than 700. Losses among the officers of the combined squadron were especially high, with Commodore Dubourdieu and captains Meillerie and Duodo killed and Péridier seriously wounded.

The immediate aftermath saw renewed efforts by Hoste to induce the French to hand over "Flore", efforts that were rebuffed by the captain of the "Danaé", who had assumed command of the French squadron. The surviving French and Venetian ships were initially laid up in <a href="Dubrovnik">Ragusa</a> (Dubrovnik) awaiting supplies to continue the campaign, but a separate British squadron discovered and sank the supply ship at <a href="Pore%C4%8D">Parenzo</a> (Poreč), necessitating a full French withdrawal from the area. In Britain, Hoste's action was widely praised; the squadron's first lieutenants were all promoted to commander and the captains all presented with a commemorative medal. Nearly four decades later the battle was also recognized in the issue of the clasp "Lissa" to the <a href="Naval%20General%20Service%20Medal%20%281847%29">Naval General Service Medal</a>, awarded to all British participants still living in 1847. On their arrival in Britain, "Corona" and "Bellone" were repaired and later purchased for service in the Royal Navy, the newly built "Corona" being named and "Bellone" becoming the <a href="troopship">troopship</a> . "Daedalus" was commissioned in 1812 under Captain <a href="Murray%20Maxwell">Murray Maxwell</a>, but served less than a year; wrecked off <a href="Ceylon">Ceylon</a> in July 1813.

British numerical superiority in the region was assured; when French reinforcements for the Adriatic departed <a href="Toulon">Toulon</a> on 25 March they were hunted down and driven back to France by Captain <a href="Robert%20Otway">Robert Otway</a> in before they had even passed <a href="Corsica">Corsica</a>. Throughout the remainder of 1811 however, British and French frigate squadrons continued to spar across the Adriatic, the most significant engagement being the <a href="action%20of%2029%20November%201811">action of 29 November 1811</a>, in which a second French squadron was destroyed. The action had significant long-term effects; the destruction of one of the best-trained and best-led squadrons in the French Navy and the death of the aggressive Dubourdieu ended the French ability to strike into the Balkans against the Ottoman Empire.

Noronhomys

Noronhomys vespuccii, also known as Vespucci's rodent, is an <a href="extinction">extinct</a> rat <a href="species">species</a> from the islands of <a href="Fernando%20de%20Noronha">Fernando de Noronha</a> off northeastern <a href="List%20of%20mammals%20of%20Brazil">Brazil</a>. Italian explorer <a href="Amerigo%20Vespucci">Amerigo Vespucci</a> may have seen it on a visit to Fernando de Noronha in 1503, but it subsequently became extinct, perhaps because of the exotic rats and mice introduced by the first explorers of the island. Numerous but fragmentary fossil remains of the animal, of uncertain but probably <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> age, were discovered in 1973 and described in 1999.

"Noronhomys vespuccii" was a fairly large rodent, larger than the <a href="black%20rat">black rat</a> ("Rattus rattus"). A member of the family <a href="Cricetidae">Cricetidae</a> and subfamily <a href="Sigmodontinae">Sigmodontinae</a>, it shares several distinctive characters with "Holochilus" and related genera within the tribe <a href="Oryzomyini">Oryzomyini</a>, including high-crowned molars with simplified crown features and the presence of several ridges on the skull which help anchor the chewing muscles. Although a suite of traits suggest that "Holochilus" is its closest relative, it is distinctive in many ways and is therefore classified in a separate <a href="genus">genus</a>, Noronhomys. Its close relatives, including "Holochilus" and "Lundomys", are adapted to a <a href="List%20of%20semiaquatic%20tetrapods">semiaquatic</a> lifestyle, spending much of their time in the water, but features of the "Noronhomys" bones suggest that it lost its semiaquatic lifestyle after arrival at its remote island.

Italian explorer <a href="Amerigo%20Vespucci">Amerigo Vespucci</a> may have seen this animal on <a href="Vespucci%27s%20fourth%20voyage">his fourth voyage</a>, which took him to Brazil; the "<a href="Lettera%20di%20Amerigo%20Vespucci%20delle%20Isole%20Nuovamente%20in%20Quattro%20Suoi%20Viaggi">Lettera di Amerigo Vespucci delle Isole Nuovamente in Quattro Suoi Viaggi</a>" recorded that he visited an island just south of the equator on August 10, 1503. On this island, identified as Fernando de Noronha, he saw "very big rats and lizards with two tails, and some snakes". The "Lettera" purports to be an account of Vespucci's voyages, but it is unlikely that he produced it himself and, additionally, his fourth voyage may never have actually taken place. The biological details given in the "Lettera"s account of Fernando de Noronha agree with what is known of the natural history of the island, lending weight to the view that it derives from an actual visit, whether by Vespucci himself or by another explorer. The lizard is probably "<a href="Trachylepis%20atlantica">Trachylepis atlantica</a>" and the record of snakes most likely refers to "<a href="Amphisbaena%20ridleyi">Amphisbaena ridleyi</a>", which is actually an <a href="amphisbaenia">amphisbaenia</a>n instead of a snake.

During excavations conducted in 1973, American ornithologist <a href="Storrs%20L.%20Olson">Storrs L. Olson</a> found <a href="fossil">fossil</a>s of a moderately large rat on Fernando de Noronha, which were described as a new genus and species in a 1999 publication by Olson and his colleague, mammalogist <a href="Michael%20D.%20Carleton">Michael D. Carleton</a>. The material is now in the United States <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">National Museum of Natural History</a> in Washington, D.C., and in the museum of the <a href="Pontif%C3%ADcia%20Universidade%20Cat%C3%B3lica%20do%20Rio%20Grande%20do%20Sul">Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul</a> in <a href="Porto%20Alegre">Porto Alegre</a>, <a href="Rio%20Grande%20do%20Sul">Rio Grande do Sul</a>. The <a href="name%20of%20a%20biological%20genus">generic name</a>, "Noronhomys", combines the name of the island of Fernando de Noronha with the Ancient Greek "mys" "mouse" and the <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a>, "vespuccii", honors Amerigo Vespucci. "Noronhomys" would have been larger than the <a href="black%20rat">black rat</a> ("Rattus rattus"), which was common on ships and which Vespucci would have been familiar with, consistent with his description of "very large rats".

"Noronhomys" is a member of the <a href="tribe%20%28taxonomy%29">tribe</a> <a href="Oryzomyini">Oryzomyini</a>, which includes over a hundred species distributed mainly in South America, including nearby islands such as the <a href="Gal%C3%A1pagos%20Islands">Galápagos Islands</a> and some of the <a href="Antilles">Antilles</a>. Oryzomyini is one of several tribes recognized within the <a href="subfamily">subfamily</a> <a href="Sigmodontinae">Sigmodontinae</a>, which encompasses hundreds of species found across South America and into southern North America. Sigmodontinae itself is the largest subfamily of the family <a href="Cricetidae">Cricetidae</a>, other members of which include <a href="vole">vole</a>s, <a href="lemming">lemming</a>s, <a href="hamster">hamster</a>s, and <a href="Peromyscus">deermice</a>, all mainly from Eurasia and North America.

Carleton and Olson performed a detailed comparison of "Noronhomys" to members of the mainland genera "<a href="Holochilus">Holochilus</a>" and "<a href="Lundomys">Lundomys</a>" on the basis of both general <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> and <a href="morphometrics">morphometrical</a> data, concluding that the Fernando de Noronha rat is distinct from both other animals.
They used a <a href="cladistics">cladistic analysis</a> to examine its relationships within Oryzomyini, also including two species of "Holochilus", "Lundomys", and five other oryzomyines. They found that "Noronhomys" appeared closest to "Holochilus", with "Lundomys" more distantly related. Eighteen shared characters (<a href="synapomorphy">synapomorphies</a>) supported the grouping of "Noronhomys" with "Holochilus". Another form described as a species of "Holochilus", "<a href="Holochilus%20primigenus">Holochilus primigenus</a>", may also be related, but is likely to fall outside the "Holochilus–Noronhomys" <a href="clade">clade</a>.

In 1998, a fragmentary fossil of another species of this same group of oryzomyines was found in eastern Argentina. It was initially identified as a possible second species of "Noronhomys" on the basis of the presence of a crest on the upper first molar, the <a href="mesoloph">mesoloph</a>, but the specimen is different from "Noronhomys vespuccii" in other respects, and in 2008 it was described as a new genus and species, "<a href="Carletonomys">Carletonomys cailoi</a>", related to "Noronhomys" and associated genera.

"Noronhomys vespuccii" is known from a number of bone fragments, including five <a href="skull">skull</a>s, damaged to various degrees, and many isolated jaws and other bones. This material documents that, with a skull of about (<a href="occipitonasal%20length">occipitonasal length</a>), "Noronhomys" was a moderately large oryzomyine, smaller than "Lundomys" but well within the range of "Holochilus". It shares a number of the features that characterize the group of "Holochilus" and related genera, including a reduction in the complexity of the chewing surface of the <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a>, simple <a href="posterolateral%20palatal%20pits">posterolateral palatal pits</a> (perforations of the <a href="palate">palate</a> near the third molar), and a similarly shaped <a href="interorbital%20region">interorbital region</a> of the skull. "Noronhomys" is distinctive, among other characters, in its lack of a spinous <a href="process%20%28anatomy%29">process</a> on the <a href="zygomatic%20plate">zygomatic plate</a>, the flattened front portion of the <a href="zygomatic%20arch">zygomatic arch</a> (cheekbone); the short palate, which does not extend behind the third molars; and the presence of an accessory crest, the mesoloph, on the upper molars.

Analysis of morphometrical data from the known material of "Noronhomys" suggests that growth continued in adults—the older the animal, the larger the depth of the <a href="mandible">mandible</a> and the size of the lower <a href="incisor">incisor</a>—and does not provide evidence for a <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">difference in size</a> between males and females. Skull shape is strikingly different from both "Holochilus" and "Lundomys", resulting in a clear separation from both of these taxa in statistical analyses of measurement data. In three individuals measured, the occipitonasal length, a measure of skull length, varies from , averaging . The width of the <a href="braincase">braincase</a> is , averaging . Between the first molars, the width of the palate is in four specimens, averaging . The lower molars have a total length of , averaging , in 39 specimens with intact molar rows. The <a href="femur">femur</a> (upper leg bone) is in length in nine specimens, averaging . Carleton and Olson estimated that body mass in "Noronhomys" was similar to that of some populations of living "<a href="Holochilus%20sciureus">Holochilus sciureus</a>" at about .

The skull is flattened in general shape. The front part is short and broad. The broad <a href="interorbital%20region">interorbital region</a> (located between the eyes) is hourglass-shaped, with squared edges and weakly developed beading. A <a href="postorbital%20ridge">postorbital ridge</a> is present, obscuring the <a href="suture%20%28joint%29">suture</a> (joint) between the <a href="frontal%20bone">frontal</a> and <a href="squamosal">squamosal</a> bones, a feature shared only with "Holochilus" among oryzomyines. The braincase is squarish. The <a href="interparietal">interparietal</a> bone is wide, but does not reach the squamosals on the sides. The zygomatic arches, which are well-developed, are furthest apart at the back and converge toward the front. The <a href="jugal">jugal</a> bone is small.

The back margin of the zygomatic plate is located close to the front of the upper first molar. The <a href="incisive%20foramen">incisive foramina</a> do not extend between the molars. Unlike in both "Holochilus" and "Lundomys", the palate is flat, lacking a distinct ridge at the midline. The <a href="parapterygoid%20fossa">parapterygoid fossa</a>e, which are located behind the palate at the level of the molars, are excavated somewhat above the level of the palate. A <a href="alisphenoid%20strut">strut of the alisphenoid bone</a> is present, separating two openings in the skull, the <a href="masticatory%E2%80%93buccinator%20foramen">masticatory–buccinator foramen</a> and the <a href="foramen%20ovale%20accessorium">foramen ovale accessorium</a>. The <a href="subsquamosal%20fenestra">subsquamosal fenestra</a>, an opening at the back of the skull determined by the shape of the squamosal, is present but small. The squamosal probably lacks a suspensory process that contacts the <a href="tegmen%20tympani">tegmen tympani</a>, the roof of the <a href="tympanic%20cavity">tympanic cavity</a>, a defining character of oryzomyines.

The mandible (lower jaw) is robust. The two <a href="masseteric%20ridge">masseteric ridge</a>s, which anchor some of the chewing muscles, are joined together as a single crest for a portion of their length and extend forward to a point below the first molar. The <a href="capsular%20process">capsular process</a>, a raising of the mandibular bone at the back end of the lower incisor, is well developed.

In the upper incisors, the chewing edges are located behind the vertical plane of the incisors; thus, they are <a href="opisthodont">opisthodont</a>. The microstructure of the <a href="Tooth%20enamel">enamel</a> of the lower incisor was reported in a 2005 study. The inner portion (portio interna, PI) is much thicker than the outer portion (portio externa, PE). The PI consists of <a href="Hunter-Schreger%20band">Hunter-Schreger band</a>s, which are uniserial (consisting of a single enamel prism), as in all <a href="Myomorpha">myomorph</a> rodents. The PE consists of <a href="radial%20enamel">radial enamel</a>, with flattened prisms that are almost parallel to the junction between the enamel and the <a href="dentine">dentine</a>. The microstructure is similar to that of "<a href="Holochilus%20brasiliensis">Holochilus brasiliensis</a>" and displays several characters seen only in Myomorpha.

The molars are high-crowned (<a href="hypsodont">hypsodont</a>) and planar, with the main cusps as high as the crests connecting them, a configuration shared only with "Holochilus" and "Carletonomys" among oryzomyines. The first molars are the longest and the third molars are longer but narrower than the second molars. The molars lack many accessory ridges, including the <a href="anteroloph">anteroloph</a> on the first upper molar, the <a href="posteroloph">posteroloph</a> on the first and second upper molar, and the <a href="anterolophid">anterolophid</a> and <a href="mesolophid">mesolophid</a> on all lower molars. The first and second upper molar have a short mesoloph and the front cusp of the first lower molar, the anteroconid, encloses a large internal pit. Most of the folds between the cusps and crests are open at the margins of the molars, but two—the <a href="posteroflexid">posteroflexid</a> on the lower second molar and the <a href="entoflexid">entoflexid</a> on the lower third molar—are closed by a wall, or <a href="Cingulum%20%28tooth%29">cingulum</a>, at the inner margin of the tooth. As in most oryzomyines, the upper molars all have one root on the inner (lingual) side and two on the outer (labial) side and the lower molars have a single root at the front and back of each molar; in addition, the first upper molar has another labial root and the first lower molar has a small labial and usually also a small lingual root located between the main roots.

The <a href="entepicondylar%20foramen">entepicondylar foramen</a> is absent, as in all members of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as in some other rodents, this <a href="foramen">foramen</a> (opening) perforates the distal (far) end of the <a href="humerus">humerus</a> (upper arm bone). The <a href="pelvis">pelvis</a> and the bones of the hindlimbs are heavily built. The femoral tubercle of the <a href="acetabulum">acetabulum</a> (part of the pelvis), which anchors the rectum femoris muscle, is reduced relative to "Holochilus" and "Lundomys".

"Noronhomys" is known only from <a href="Fernando%20de%20Noronha">Fernando de Noronha</a>, a small archipelago of volcanic origin off northeastern Brazil, consisting of a main island and several associated smaller islands. The formation of the archipelago, which has never been connected to the mainland, began about 11 million years ago; active <a href="Volcanism">vulcanism</a> ceased about 2 million years ago. Remains of "Noronhomys" were found in association with remains of various reptiles, birds, and snails, several of which are also restricted to the archipelago, in sand dunes near the northeastern tip of the main island. The age of the deposits is unknown, but is likely late <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a>, at most a few thousand years old.

The ancestor of "Noronhomys" may have been a <a href="List%20of%20semiaquatic%20tetrapods">semiaquatic</a> animal, similar to living "Holochilus" or "Lundomys", that arrived on Fernando de Noronha by chance on a floating log. The morphology of the limb bones in "Noronhomys" suggests that the animal was not semiaquatic like its relatives, but terrestrial, consistent with its occurrence on a small island, where streams and pools are rare or absent.

Vespucci's account suggests that "Noronhomys" was common when the island was first visited, but was not encountered by the first biological explorers of the island, who conducted their research in the late 19th century. The <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> black rat and <a href="house%20mouse">house mouse</a> ("Mus musculus"), which became very common on the island, may have driven it to extinction by directly competing for food, preying on young "Noronhomys", or transmitting diseases. Other factors that may have played a role include modification of its habitat, introduction of predators such as <a href="cat">cat</a>s ("Felis catus"), and predation by visiting sailors. These extinction mechanisms are common for island <a href="endemic">endemic</a> species. In 1888, <a href="Henry%20Nicholas%20Ridley">Henry Nicholas Ridley</a> already suggested that the rat Vespucci had seen had been driven to extinction by the introduced black rat. The <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> lists it as "extinct".

The method of embalming was not recorded, but it probably involved replacing the blood with a mixture of <a href="turpentine">turpentine</a> and <a href="vermilion">vermilion</a>. The body was then put in an old clock case and stored in the house of Beswick's family physician, <a href="Charles%20White%20%28physician%29">Dr Charles White</a>. Beswick's apparently eccentric will made her a local celebrity, and visitors were allowed to view her at White's house.

Beswick's mummified body was eventually bequeathed to the <a href="Manchester%20Museum">Museum of the Manchester Natural History Society</a>, where she was put on display and acquired the soubriquet of the Manchester Mummy, or the Mummy of Birchin Bower. The museum's collection was later transferred to <a href="Manchester%20University">Manchester University</a>, when it was decided, with the permission of the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Manchester">Bishop of Manchester</a>, that Beswick should finally be buried. The ceremony took place at <a href="Harpurhey">Harpurhey</a> Cemetery on 22 July 1868, more than 110 years after her death; the grave is unmarked.

The mid-18th century saw an upsurge in the public's fear of being mistakenly buried alive, and much debate about the uncertainty of the signs of death. Various suggestions were made to test for signs of life before burial, ranging from pouring vinegar and pepper into the corpse's mouth to applying red hot pokers to the feet, or even into the <a href="rectum">rectum</a>. Writing in 1895, the physician J. C. Ouseley claimed that as many as 2,700 people were buried prematurely each year in England and Wales, although others estimated the figure to be closer to 800.

Hannah Beswick was born in 1688, the daughter of John and Patience Beswick, of Cheetwood Old Hall, Manchester, she inherited considerable wealth from her father who died in 1706. Some years before her own death, one of Hannah's brothers, John, had shown signs of life just as his coffin lid had been about to be closed. A mourner noticed that John's eyelids appeared to be flickering, and on examination the family physician, <a href="Charles%20White%20%28surgeon%29">Dr Charles White</a>, confirmed that he was still alive. John regained consciousness a few days later, and lived for many more years.

Jessie Dobson, Recorder of the Museum of the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Surgeons%20of%20England">Royal College of Surgeons of England</a>, has said that there appear to be many "inaccuracies and contradictions" in accounts of the events following Beswick's death in 1758. Many suggest that she left £25,000 (equivalent to about £ as of 2019) to White, a pioneer of <a href="obstetrics">obstetrics</a> and one of the founders of the <a href="Manchester%20Royal%20Infirmary">Manchester Royal Infirmary</a>, on the condition that her body was kept above ground, and that periodically she was to be checked for signs of life. Beswick's <a href="will%20%28law%29">will</a> however, dated 25 July 1757 (less than a year before her death), states only that White was to receive £100 (£ as of 2019), and that £400 (£ as of 2019) was to be allocated for funeral expenses. Some accounts have suggested that White was an <a href="executor">executor</a> of Beswick's will and that he received the £400 himself, from which he was permitted to keep any surplus after the funeral expenses had been paid. Having Beswick embalmed therefore allowed him to keep the whole amount. Alternatively it has been suggested that White was considerably in debt to Beswick, a debt that would have to be repaid after the funeral, which was avoided by her embalming, but Beswick's will names Mary Graeme and Esther Robinson as her executors, not White. In 1866, more than 100 years after her death, the details of Beswick's will were still being disputed.

There is no mention in Beswick's 1757 will of her desire to be <a href="embalming">embalmed</a>. It has been suggested that White had been asked to keep Beswick above ground only until it became obvious that she was actually dead, but that he was unable to resist the temptation to add a mummy to his collection of "wet and dry" exhibits, and so made the decision to embalm her. White had developed a particular interest in anatomy while studying medicine in London and was building up a collection of "curiosities", which by the time of his death included the skeleton of Thomas Higgins, a <a href="highwayman">highwayman</a> and sheep-stealer hanged for burglary, as well as Hannah Beswick's mummy.

The method of embalming used by White is unrecorded, but in 1748 he had studied under the anatomist <a href="William%20Hunter%20%28anatomist%29">William Hunter</a>, who had developed an early system of arterial embalming, therefore it is likely that White used the same method. The <a href="veins">veins</a> and <a href="arteries">arteries</a> would have been injected with a mixture of <a href="turpentine">turpentine</a> and <a href="vermilion">vermilion</a>, after which the <a href="Viscus">organs</a> would have been removed from the chest and abdomen and placed in water, to clean them and to reduce their bulk. As much blood as possible would then have been squeezed out of the corpse, and the whole body washed with alcohol. The next stage would have been to replace the organs and to repeat the injection of turpentine and vermilion. The body cavities would then have been filled with a mixture of <a href="camphor">camphor</a>, <a href="Niter">nitre</a> and <a href="resin">resin</a>, before the body was sewn up and all openings filled with camphor. After a final washing, the body would have been packed into a box containing <a href="plaster">plaster of Paris</a>, to absorb any moisture, and then probably coated with tar, to preserve it.

Beswick's mummified body was initially kept at <a href="Ancoats%20Hall">Ancoats Hall</a>, the home of another Beswick family member, but it was soon moved to a room in Dr White's home in Sale, Manchester, where it was stored in an old clock case.
Beswick's apparently eccentric will made her a celebrity; the author <a href="Thomas%20de%20Quincey">Thomas de Quincey</a> was one of those who went to view her at White's house. Following White's death in 1813, Beswick's body was bequeathed to a Dr Ollier, on whose death in 1828 it was donated to the <a href="Manchester%20Museum">Museum of the Manchester Natural History Society</a>, where she became known as the Manchester Mummy, or the Mummy of Birchin Bower. She was displayed in the museum's entrance hall, next to a <a href="Chinchorro%20mummies">Peruvian</a> and an Egyptian <a href="mummy">mummy</a>, and her relatives were allowed free access to visit her as they wished. She was described by a visitor in 1844 as "one of the most remarkable objects in the museum". The "cold dark shadow of her mummy hung over Manchester in the middle of the eighteenth century", according to writer <a href="Edith%20Sitwell">Edith Sitwell</a>.

There are no pictures of Hannah Beswick. One of the few contemporary accounts of her is provided by Philip Wentworth, a local historian:
Shortly after the museum's transfer to <a href="Manchester%20University">Manchester University</a> in 1867 it was decided that as Beswick was "irrevocably and unmistakably dead", the time had come for her to be buried. But since 1837 UK law had required that a medical examiner issue a <a href="death%20certificate">certificate of death</a> before a burial could take place; as Beswick had died in 1758 an appeal had to be made to the Secretary of State, who issued an order for her burial. With the permission of the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Manchester">Bishop of Manchester</a>, Hannah Beswick was interred in an unmarked grave in <a href="Harpurhey">Harpurhey</a> Cemetery on 22 July 1868, more than 110 years after her death.

<a href="Charles%20Edward%20Stuart">Bonnie Prince Charlie</a> entered Manchester at the head of his invading army in 1745, causing Beswick some apprehension over the safety of her money, which she therefore decided to bury. Shortly before her death she promised to show her relatives where the treasure was hidden, but she did not survive long enough to do so. Her home, Birchin Bower, was converted into workers' tenements following her death. Several of those living there claimed to have seen a figure dressed in a black silk gown and a white cap, and described it as Hannah Beswick. After gliding across the house's parlour, the apparition would vanish at one particular flagstone. It is claimed that while digging to fit a new loom, a weaver living there discovered Beswick's hoard of gold, hidden underneath that same flagstone. Oliphant's, a Manchester gold dealer, paid the weaver £3 10<a href="Shilling">s</a> for each gold piece, the equivalent of almost £ in 2019.

Birchin Bower was eventually demolished to make way for a <a href="Ferranti">Ferranti</a> factory, but sightings of the apparition were still reported.

When Beswick's family home, Cheetwood Old Hall was demolished in 1890 to make way for a brickyard, contractors discovered a double coffin buried underneath the drawing room, the mystery of the burial was never solved but at the time it was thought to be connected to the Beswick family and Dr White who had resided at the hall after Hannah Beswick removed to Oldham.

Michael Gomez

Michael Gomez (born Michael Armstrong; 21 June 1977) is a former <a href="professional%20boxer">professional boxer</a> who competed from 1995 to 2009. He was born to an <a href="Irish%20Traveller">Irish Traveller</a> family in <a href="Longford">Longford</a>, <a href="County%20Longford">County Longford</a>, Ireland, spending his early years in <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> before moving to London and later <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, England, with his family at the age of nine. In boxing he was affectionately known as "The Predator", "The Irish Mexican" and "The Mancunian Mexican".

Despite finishing his career fighting in the <a href="lightweight">lightweight</a> division, Gomez is more notable for his fights at <a href="featherweight">featherweight</a> and <a href="super-featherweight">super-featherweight</a>. During his career he amassed a number of regional championships, most significantly the <a href="British%20Boxing%20Board%20of%20Control">British</a> <a href="super-featherweight">super-featherweight</a> title twice, from 1999 to 2004. He also held the <a href="World%20Boxing%20Union">WBU</a> super featherweight title from 2004 to 2005.

Gomez, who has been compared to <a href="Johnny%20Tapia">Johnny Tapia</a>, has lived a turbulent life and was often involved in controversial fights. In Gomez's initial matches he suffered a number of losses to <a href="Journeyman%20%28boxing%29">journeyman</a> opposition but then went on a run of victories which stretched for almost four years. Of his 17 fights between February 2001 and March 2008, 16 ended in <a href="knockout">knockout</a>s. Concerns arose about his drinking and failure to adhere to his <a href="diet%20regime">diet</a> and <a href="Boxing%20training">training</a> regimes after a loss to <a href="L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3%20Bogn%C3%A1r">László Bognár</a> in 2001. Gomez appeared to be "back on track" in 2003, with his high-profile fight against <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>-based fighter <a href="Alex%20Arthur">Alex Arthur</a> for the British and <a href="World%20Boxing%20Association">WBA</a> Inter-Continental super-featherweight titles, which Gomez won by knocking out Arthur in the fifth round.

In 2006, Gomez suffered a controversial loss to <a href="Peter%20McDonagh">Peter McDonagh</a> when, in the middle of a round, he dropped his guard and walked out of the ring, later saying he had retired from boxing. He returned to the ring after a 15-month interval. On 21 June 2008, Gomez lost what was seen as possibly his last bout: a <a href="Last%20chance%20saloon%23As%20an%20English%20metaphor">last chance saloon</a> opportunity to resurrect his career against rising star and Olympic silver medallist <a href="Amir%20Khan%20%28boxer%29">Amir Khan</a>. Although scoring a surprise <a href="knockdown%20%28combat%20sports%29">knockdown</a> against Khan early on, the fight ended with Gomez being <a href="technical%20knockout">stopped</a> in five rounds.

Gomez took the surname Gomez after his childhood hero <a href="Wilfredo%20G%C3%B3mez">Wilfredo Gómez</a>.

Michael Armstrong was born into an <a href="Irish%20traveller">Irish traveller</a> family in Longford, Ireland. His mother went into labour with him while driving, so his <a href="partially%20sighted">partially sighted</a> father took over the wheel but crashed the car into a lamp post on the way to the hospital; Michael was delivered in the back seat. The Armstrong family moved to <a href="Ballymun">Ballymun</a>, Dublin, and, when Michael was age nine, to Manchester, England.
Following the family's move to England, Armstrong's father's eyesight failed further due to <a href="retinitis%20pigmentosa">retinitis pigmentosa</a>. By that time, there were ten children in the Armstrong family. After his younger sister, Louise, died from <a href="sudden%20infant%20death%20syndrome">sudden infant death syndrome</a>, his mother left the family to live with another woman. Armstrong subsequently spent much of his youth in various <a href="orphanage">children's homes</a>, and was a serial <a href="truancy">truant</a> from school. His mother had taught him to <a href="shoplifting">shoplift</a> as a child, and he was involved in <a href="Misdemeanor">petty crime</a> throughout his youth in Manchester. At nine years old, he began <a href="Boxing%20training">training</a> at Brian Hughes' Collyhurst and Moston Boys' Club. He also played <a href="association%20football">football</a> for a local North Manchester team until the club received so many fines for Armstrong's fighting on the pitch that they were unable to pay them. At this point, he stopped playing football to concentrate on his training in the ring. During his time in the children's home Armstrong met Alison, who has remained his companion (and later his wife) throughout his professional career; they were parents by the time Armstrong was 17.

Armstrong boxed as an <a href="amateur%20boxing">amateur</a> before turning professional in June 1995. He chose the professional surname "Gomez" when the <a href="British%20Boxing%20Board%20of%20Control">British Boxing Board of Control</a> (BBBoC) required him to select another name at the time of his registration as a professional; there was <a href="Michael%20Armstrong%20%28boxer%29">another boxer</a> in the same weight division using the name "Michael Armstrong". He chose his ring name in honour of <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rican</a> boxer <a href="Wilfredo%20G%C3%B3mez">Wilfredo Gómez</a>, whose videotaped fights Armstrong had studied intently as a youth. The name, combined with Gomez's "<a href="Boxing%23Brawler/slugger">brawl</a>ing style", earned him the nickname of "the Irish Mexican". He developed a ring persona based on this nickname, which has remained popular with fans throughout his career. His ring entrance music is that of a Mexican <a href="Mariachi">Mariachi</a> band, a reference to his <a href="Spanish%20language">Hispanic-sounding</a> chosen name, and many of his supporters wear <a href="sombrero">sombrero</a>s to his fights and wave Irish flags. Gomez also wears long Mexican-style boxing shorts in the colours of the <a href="flag%20of%20Ireland">flag of Ireland</a> and often has the shape of a <a href="shamrock">shamrock</a> shaved into the hair on the back of his head.

In his debut fight at the <a href="Manchester%20Central%20%28Conference%20Centre%29">G-Mex Leisure Centre</a>, Manchester, England, Gomez beat previously undefeated Danny Ruegg on the <a href="undercard">undercard</a> of a <a href="boxingcard">bill</a> that included <a href="Robin%20Reid%20%28boxer%29">Robin Reid</a> and <a href="Michael%20Brodie">Michael Brodie</a>. Despite this initial win, Gomez's early career was littered with losses to journeyman fighters such as Greg Upton and Chris Williams.
In 1996, Gomez was charged with murder after a <a href="gang">gang</a> fight outside a nightclub in Manchester. Gomez had hit one of his attackers, Sam Parle, who died after his head hit the pavement as a result of the blow. The charge was later reduced to <a href="manslaughter">manslaughter</a> and Gomez was cleared after it was ruled that he had acted in <a href="self-defense">self-defence</a>.

After this shaky beginning in the professional ranks, Gomez had a run of victories from September 1997 to February 1999. During this period Gomez won seven straight fights before challenging for his first title belt, the vacant British Central Area featherweight title against Chris Jickells on 27 February 1999 in <a href="Oldham">Oldham</a>. Gomez won the title with a fifth-round knockout. He followed his first title win by adding another championship, the <a href="IBF">IBF</a> Inter-Continental featherweight title, with a second-round knockout over Nigel Leake.

Later that year, Gomez relinquished his championship belts in a bid to move up to the super featherweight division. His first fight in the division, in September 1999, was for the vacant British super featherweight title, against the experienced and much heralded <a href="Liverpudlian">Liverpudlian</a> fighter <a href="Gary%20Thornhill">Gary Thornhill</a>. Gomez defeated Thornhill with a second-round knockout. In November 1999, Gomez faced off against <a href="Mexican%20people">Mexican</a> Jose Manjarrez for the <a href="WBO">WBO</a> Inter-Continental super featherweight title, walking away with the title based on the judges' scores after the full twelve rounds. In 1999, Gomez won four title belts, was undefeated during the year and was also named "Young Boxer of the Year" by the British Boxing Writers' Club. He continued his winning form into 2000 with another run of six wins, and successfully defended his British super featherweight title against <a href="Dean%20Pithie">Dean Pithie</a>, Carl Greaves and <a href="Ian%20McLeod%20%28boxer%29">Ian McLeod</a>.

Gomez's first fight in 2001 was on 10 February against <a href="Hungarian%20people">Hungarian</a> boxer <a href="Laszlo%20Bognar">Laszlo Bognar</a> for the WBO Inter-Continental super featherweight title, in <a href="Widnes">Widnes</a>, Cheshire. Gomez had Bognar on the <a href="boxing%20ring">canvas</a> in the fifth round, but Bognar recovered from this knockdown and used his <a href="southpaw">southpaw</a> jab to keep Gomez from closing in. In the ninth round referee Dave Paris stopped the fight following a double left from Bognar, which had Gomez stricken against the ropes. Gomez felt the fight had been stopped prematurely and that he should have been allowed to continue. Gomez later stated that he was suffering from <a href="influenza">flu</a> and should not have taken the fight. The "<a href="Daily%20Telegraph">Daily Telegraph</a>" reported after the match that the pre-fight weigh-in and medical examination were not carried out in accordance with BBBC regulations: the volunteer inspector left before Bognar and Gomez had weighed in, and the medical examiner had not detected that Gomez was ill.

Gomez sought a rematch against Bognar, and five months later in July 2001 the pair met again, this time in Manchester, resulting in a victory for Gomez. The fight started badly for Gomez when he suffered a <a href="Knockout%23Knockdown">flash knockdown</a> in the first round and was down again in the second. Gomez came back to knock Bognar down near the end of the second round. Gomez came out firing at the start of the third round and finished the fight with a fourth and final knockdown to avenge his earlier defeat. He followed up his victory over Bognar with a second-round knockout of Scottish fighter <a href="Craig%20Docherty">Craig Docherty</a> for another British super featherweight title win.

His next opponent was unbeaten <a href="West%20Ham">West Ham</a>-based fighter <a href="Kevin%20Lear">Kevin Lear</a> on 1 June 2002, again in Manchester, on the undercard of the <a href="Ricky%20Hatton">Ricky Hatton</a> vs. <a href="Eamonn%20Magee">Eamonn Magee</a> fight. Lear, a former <a href="Amateur%20Boxing%20Association%20of%20England">Amateur Boxing Association of England (ABA)</a> champion, kept a one-dimensional Gomez at bay with his sharp <a href="jab">jab</a> from the outset of the fight. Gomez took several punches to the face, and his nose began to bleed heavily starting in the sixth round. By the eighth round Gomez was slowing, suffering the effects of Lear's continuing barrage of combinations. At the end of the eighth round Gomez's trainer Brian Hughes retired his fighter, giving Lear a surprise victory.

The defeat to Lear, and the manner in which the fight ended, prompted Hughes, Gomez's longtime mentor and trainer, to ask Gomez to retire from boxing. This event signalled the end of the relationship between Gomez and Hughes; soon after, Gomez crossed Manchester to join Ricky Hatton and former Collyhurst gym stablemate <a href="Anthony%20Farnell">Anthony Farnell</a> at the rival Phoenix Gym run by Billy Graham. Gomez followed the defeat to Lear with a string of three wins, all by knockout.

During the period between the first Bognar fight and the loss to Lear, Gomez's life spun out of control. He was "boozing, brawling and womanising", and was convicted of four <a href="Drunk%20driving%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">drink-drive</a> offenses. During a <a href="street%20fighting">street fight</a>, Gomez was stabbed and badly injured—his heart stopped beating for 148 seconds while on the <a href="Surgery">operating table</a>.

Following his change in trainer, Gomez was contracted for the highest profile fight of his career against <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>-based fighter "Amazing" Alex Arthur for the British and <a href="World%20Boxing%20Association">WBA</a> Inter-Continental super featherweight titles. The fight took place in a sold-out <a href="Meadowbank%20Stadium">Meadowbank Stadium</a> in October 2003, in what was the first professional boxing card in Edinburgh in almost 20 years.

Prior to the fight, Arthur had opined during interviews that "looking deep into Gomez's eyes at the press conference, I'm not sure even he believes he can win. He'll be so fired up I expect it'll take me eight or nine rounds but, if his resistance has gone as people are saying, it could be a lot sooner." With respect to his approach to the fight, Arthur added "I see about 20 ways to beat him. I'm just looking forward to shutting him up."

Arthur, who was looking to retain the <a href="BBBofC">BBBofC</a> <a href="Lonsdale%20Belt">Lonsdale Belt</a>, was seen as a rising star in British boxing. He was a strong favourite to win the bout against Gomez, who was perceived to have been through too many battles and abused his body too much, and the fight was seen as a stepping stone on Arthur's way to a future world championship. However, <a href="Freddie%20Roach%20%28boxing%29">Freddie Roach</a>, Arthur's trainer, was criticised when he remained in the United States to coach another boxer instead of continuing to work with Arthur to prepare for his championship match.

Gomez proved his critics wrong when he arrived at the fight in prime condition and with aggression, determination and desire. The first two rounds started at a furious pace, with Arthur keeping Gomez at bay with stiff jabs and Gomez working inside with hooks and body punches. The match was turning into a clash of opposing styles, Arthur displaying control and boxing technique and Gomez storming forward with wild ferocity. From the third round the fight began to turn Gomez's way. Gomez cut Arthur in the third and silenced the home crowd, who were not used to seeing the home-town hero being battered in this manner. Gomez dominated the fourth round and was in full control of the fight—he exposed Arthur's weak defence and at one stage landed 28 punches without reply.

Gomez knocked down his opponent twice before delivering a jarring left hook to Arthur, knocking Arthur to the canvas for the third time. Referee John Coyle stopped the fight, and Gomez won with the resulting <a href="knock%20out">TKO</a> in the fifth round. The match was hailed as one of the best fights in Britain for a decade. Boxing promoter <a href="Frank%20Warren%20%28promoter%29">Frank Warren</a> called the fight "the greatest contest seen on these shores since <a href="Nigel%20Benn">Nigel Benn</a> beat <a href="Gerald%20McClellan">Gerald McClellan</a> in 1995". Retired Scottish boxer <a href="Ken%20Buchanan">Ken Buchanan</a> said it was one of the best fights he had ever seen.

Gomez attended Arthur's next fight against Ugandan Michael Kizza in Meadowbank, Scotland, but Arthur did not appear when Gomez fought Ben Odamattey for the <a href="WBU">WBU</a> super featherweight title in Manchester a few weeks later. Gomez pointed this out when being interviewed shortly afterward, adding "Sky Television want a return. Frank Warren, Arthur's manager, wants a re-match. And most of all so do I." Arthur responded by saying "the fight (with Gomez) is definitely going to happen. Hopefully I'll get another warm-up fight in June and then take on Gomez in September." Despite the rhetoric, the two fighters did not meet each other in the ring again.

In March 2004, Gomez fought Ghanaian Ben Odamattey for the <a href="WBU">WBU</a> super featherweight title at the MEN Arena in Manchester, winning the championship by stopping Odamattey in the third round. He retained his WBU title in his next two fights against <a href="Justin%20Juuko">Justin Juuko</a> and Leva Kirakosyan with knockout wins. Gomez then faced <a href="Argentinian">Argentinian</a> boxer "El Vikingo" Javier Osvaldo Alvarez in February 2005, once again fighting at the MEN Arena in Manchester. WBO super middleweight title holder <a href="Joe%20Calzaghe">Joe Calzaghe</a> had been scheduled to top the bill but pulled out of his arranged fight, and Gomez and Alvarez were slotted as the main attraction.

The pair clashed at the weigh in, and this antagonism carried into the ring; from the outset of the fight Gomez tried to draw Alvarez into a <a href="Boxing%23Brawler/slugger">brawl</a>. Gomez appeared to win the first two rounds behind stinging jabs, but Alvarez seemed unruffled. In the third round, Alvarez started to take control of the fight and landed several blows to Gomez's face. Gomez began quickly in the fourth round, attacking Alvarez from behind his jab and working his way through his opponent's defense. Alvarez appeared content to catch Gomez as he moved forward. Despite Gomez's strong start, Alvarez dazed Gomez with a stiff right hand shot in the fourth round, after which the Argentinian launched into a furious onslaught. Gomez steadied in the fifth but was visibly tired. Two minutes into the sixth round, Alvarez floored Gomez with a right hook. Gomez <a href="Professional%20boxing%23Scoring">beat the count</a> and Alvarez then moved in to continue his attack. Referee <a href="Mickey%20Vann">Mickey Vann</a> stopped the fight after 2 minutes 25 seconds of the round with Gomez pinned to the ropes and taking significant punishment.

Gomez was out of the ring for almost a year following the Alvarez fight and was next due to fight <a href="Willie%20Limond">Willie Limond</a> for the WBU lightweight title, but turned down the opportunity for a chance to fight for an Irish title. Gomez then signed up to fight fellow English-based <a href="Irishman">Irishman</a>, <a href="Peter%20McDonagh">Peter McDonagh</a>, for the Irish lightweight title on the undercard of a <a href="Bernard%20Dunne">Bernard Dunne</a> fight on 28 January 2006 at the <a href="National%20Stadium%2C%20Dublin">National Stadium, Dublin</a>. After the fight was signed Gomez stated "I just can't wait to get my hands on that Irish title because I've been desperate to fight in Ireland for years."

Leading up to the fight McDonagh was making visits to see <a href="paranormalist">paranormalist</a> <a href="Uri%20Geller">Uri Geller</a> as "mind coach" to help him prepare mentally for the fight, and Geller also travelled with him to Dublin for the fight. Gomez commented that "I'm not sure Uri Geller will be of much use to him though because there won't be any spoons in that ring for him to bend. The only thing I plan on bending is some of McDonagh's ribs with my body punches."

The first four rounds were relatively close, with Gomez leading according to pundits, but the fight ended in the fifth round under bizarre circumstances when for no apparent reason Gomez stopped fighting and failed to defend himself. He then received a number of unanswered punches from McDonagh before being floored. Gomez rose from the canvas immediately but appeared to ignore the referee and walk towards his corner while the referee continued with his count. Gomez then left the ring as the referee was waving the fight off. <a href="RT%C3%89">RTÉ</a> commentator <a href="Steve%20Collins">Steve Collins</a> said "I smell a rat, something's not right here."

The <a href="Boxing%20Union%20of%20Ireland">Boxing Union of Ireland</a> (BUI) initially suspended both fighters' <a href="Prize%20money">purses</a>, and investigated reports of unusual betting patterns, with large sums of money being placed on McDonagh to win <a href="Boxing%23Rules">inside the distance</a> and more specifically in the fifth round. Odds on McDonagh to win the fight in the fifth round had been cut from 125–1 to 18–1 by the afternoon of the bout. Following their investigation, the BUI released the purses to each of the fighters, stating "Michael Gomez and Peter McDonagh confirmed that neither they, their families, nor any person in their camp, as far as they were aware, betted on the fight." The BUI did express disappointment that the <a href="bookmaker">bookmaker</a>, <a href="Boylesports">Boylesports</a>, who had suspended wagering on the bout due to the unusual betting patterns, had chosen not to reply to the investigators' queries.
Gomez later explained the loss by saying that "it was all very simple, I just came to a decision in there that I need to retire from boxing full stop". Gomez further indicated that he planned to pursue a career in bodybuilding. McDonagh, meanwhile, claimed that he had won because of Gellar's assistance leading up to the bout.

Gomez sought a second opportunity to fight McDonagh; in April 2007, he offered to fight for only his training costs. Finally, their rematch for the Irish lightweight title, to be billed as ""Redemption"", was set for 23 May 2008, but McDonagh pulled out of the scheduled bout.

Gomez found himself once again drawn to boxing after watching a fight between Alex Arthur and <a href="Carl%20Johanneson">Carl Johanneson</a>, and resumed training. In May 2007, fifteen months after his fight with McDonagh, he returned to the ring to face Daniel Thorpe at the Altrincham Leisure Centre, Manchester.

Gomez had left the Phoenix Gym and was now training at Bobby Rimmers' Boxing Academy in <a href="Stalybridge">Stalybridge</a>, Manchester, and had returned to fight in the <a href="super%20featherweight">super featherweight</a> division. The fight was billed as ""The Last Stand"", and the venue was sold out with fellow fighters Ricky Hatton and his brother <a href="Matthew%20Hatton">Matthew Hatton</a> cheering him on from ringside. Gomez won the fight with a stoppage in the third round. The following month Gomez also beat Youssef Al Hamidi, again with a third round stoppage. Following two comeback fights against journeyman opposition Gomez was rumoured to be in line for fights against many of Britain and Ireland's top level super featherweights and lightweights including <a href="Kevin%20Mitchell%20%28professional%20boxer%29">Kevin Mitchell</a>, <a href="Amir%20Khan%20%28British%20boxer%29">Amir Khan</a>, and Carl Johanneson; Gomez himself was seeking a rematch against Peter McDonagh.

He then signed up to face Leeds's Johanneson on 19 October 2007 at the <a href="Doncaster%20Dome">Doncaster Dome</a>, <a href="Doncaster">Doncaster</a>, England for the British super featherweight title. Johanneson had just come off his second defeat to Armenian <a href="Leva%20Kirakosyan">Leva Kirakosyan</a>, whom Gomez had knocked out in October 2004. Before the fight, Gomez was confident, stating "You can't outbox me. I'll jab your head off. If he comes to have a fight with me it is going to be early Christmas for everyone because I don't know who's going to go but someone's going to go and it's not going to be me." At the pre-fight press conference in <a href="Doncaster">Doncaster</a> both fighters squared up to each other and promised to knock each other out; during the highly charged face off both fighters had to be kept apart by their promoter and trainers.

As many expected, the highly anticipated domestic clash was a savage brawl from round one. Gomez won the opening rounds and threatened to overpower Johanneson from the opening seconds. The Leeds fighter then gained the upper hand as the fight went on, flooring Gomez in the sixth round only for the "Irish Mexican" to rise from the canvas. Soon after, with Gomez appearing unsteady on his feet, referee Mickey Vann stopped the fight. Gomez said that Vann had stopped the fight early, adding, "When the stoppage came, I wasn't wobbling or staggering, and I only dropped my hands in the fight to show Johanneson that he couldn't hurt me. But the referee simply got the wrong message. It was bad refereeing. I told him straight away I was fine, but he insisted on showing me to my corner." The former champion was clear that he wanted another opportunity to fight for the British title.

Gomez fought <a href="Amir%20Khan%20%28British%20boxer%29">Amir Khan</a> for the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> lightweight title at the <a href="National%20Indoor%20Arena">National Indoor Arena</a>, Birmingham, on 21 June 2008, Gomez's thirty-first birthday. Khan said that "there is no way he will be as fit as me, so I expect a spectacular stoppage". Gomez did not attend the scheduled pre-fight press conference, prompting Khan to deride him, and promoter Frank Warren accused Gomez of failing to show respect to Khan and the media.

During the fight Khan knocked Gomez to the canvas in the first round with a barrage of hooks and uppercuts. In the second round, Gomez caught Khan with a left hook, knocking down the younger fighter and exposing his defensive weakness; however, Khan steadied himself after the mandatory eight-count, and cut Gomez above the left eye before the round ended. Gomez caught Khan in the ribs with a left hook in the fourth round which left Khan unstable for a moment, but Khan responded with a flurry of hooks and jabs. Khan landed a "cracking left hook" in the fifth, but Gomez beat the count. At 2:32 of the fifth round, referee John Keane stopped the fight when Gomez was knocked into the ropes by a Khan left uppercut. After the fight, Khan said he felt he had moved up a level by "fighting world class fighters like Gomez."

Before the fight, sports writers considered Gomez a tough opponent for Khan, with his "knockout punch" and his success against Alex Arthur in similar circumstances, despite having lost three of his last six fights. Gomez saw the fight as an opportunity to reignite his career; in an interview shortly before the fight he spoke of how "<nowiki>[t]</nowiki>his fight really is my last chance to set myself up for life and become known in every household in Britain". At the same time, he reflected on the positive effects of his career in the ring, saying "Boxing kept my feet on the ground and gave me a focus. It's got me through the bad times and calmed me down. If it wasn't for boxing, I wouldn't have my beautiful wife and family". Gomez lives with his wife Alison and their three children in Manchester.

Leopard 2E

The Leopard 2E or Leopard 2A6E ("E" stands for "España", <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> for Spain) is a variant of the German <a href="Leopard%202">Leopard 2</a> <a href="main%20battle%20tank">main battle tank</a>, tailored to the requirements of the <a href="Spanish%20Army">Spanish army</a>, which acquired it as part of an armament modernization program named "Programa Coraza", or Program Breastplate. The acquisition program for the Leopard 2E began in 1994, five years after the cancellation of the <a href="Lince%20%28tank%29">Lince</a> tank program that culminated in an agreement to transfer 108 <a href="Leopard%202%23Leopard%202A4">Leopard 2A4s</a> to the Spanish army in 1998 and started the local production of the Leopard 2E in December 2003. Despite postponement of production owing to the 2003 merger between <a href="Santa%20B%C3%A1rbara%20Sistemas">Santa Bárbara Sistemas</a> and <a href="General%20Dynamics">General Dynamics</a>, and continued fabrication issues between 2006 and 2007, 219 Leopard 2Es have been delivered to the Spanish army.

The Leopard 2E is a major improvement over the <a href="M60%20Patton">M60 Patton</a> tank, which it replaced in Spain's mechanized and armored units. Its development represented a total of 2.6 million <a href="man-hour">man-hour</a>s worth of work, 9,600 of them in Germany, at a total cost of 2.4 billion <a href="euros">euros</a>. This makes it one of the most expensive Leopard 2s built. Indigenous production amounted to 60% and the vehicles were assembled locally at <a href="Sevilla">Sevilla</a> by Santa Bárbara Sistemas. It has thicker armor on the <a href="Gun%20turret">turret</a> and <a href="glacis">glacis</a> plate than the German Leopard 2A6, and uses a Spanish-designed tank command and control system, similar to the one fitted in German Leopard 2s. The Leopard 2E is expected to remain in service until 2025.

By 1987, the <a href="Spanish%20Army">Spanish army</a> was equipped with 299 French-designed <a href="AMX-30E">AMX-30E</a>s, assembled by Santa Bárbara Sistemas, and 552 American <a href="M47%20Patton">M47</a> and <a href="M48%20Patton">M48 Patton</a> tanks. The AMX-30Es were put into service in 1970, while the latter went into service in the mid-1950s. Although Spain's M47s and M48s were modernized to M47Es and M48Es, bringing them to near equivalence with the <a href="M60%20Patton">M60 Patton</a> tank, the Spanish army considered them antiquated. In 1984, when deciding to replace its Patton tanks, the Spanish government declared its intention to produce a whole new main battle tank locally, since known as the <a href="Lince%20%28tank%29">Lince</a>. Five companies expressed interest in bidding, including <a href="Krauss-Maffei">Krauss-Maffei</a> in a partnership with Santa Bárbara Sistemas, <a href="Nexter">GIAT</a> with what became the <a href="Leclerc%20tank">Leclerc</a>, <a href="General%20Dynamics">General Dynamics</a> with the <a href="M1%20Abrams">M1 Abrams</a> and <a href="Vickers">Vickers</a> with the Valiant. While the M1 Abrams and Valiant bids were not accepted, the bidding continued until 1989 when it was officially canceled.

Instead, the Spanish government opted to replace its older Patton tanks with <a href="United%20States">American</a> <a href="M60%20Patton">M60 Patton</a> tanks retired from Central Europe in accordance with the <a href="Treaty%20on%20Conventional%20Armed%20Forces%20in%20Europe">Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe</a>. Although the Spanish army was originally to receive 532 M60 and M60A1 tanks, only 260 M60A3s were ultimately delivered, of which 244 were put into active service in the army. In the late 1980s the Spanish Ministry of Defense approved a modernization program for 150 of its AMX-30Es and a reconstruction program for the remaining 149 vehicles of this type, restoring them to their original condition. However, neither the M60s nor the AMX-30s were a considerable improvement over Spain's fleet of M47 and M48 Patton tanks.

Since the existing tank fleet did not meet the Spanish army's needs, Spain opened talks with Germany and Krauss-Maffei over the possibility of future collaboration in regards to Spain's future tank, and sent a military delegation to Germany in 1994. Although the Germans offered Spain surplus <a href="Leopard%201">Leopard 1</a> tanks and Soviet equipment incorporated into the <a href="German%20army">German army</a> after the <a href="German%20reunification">reunification of Germany</a>, the Spanish government declined these offers and pressed for the Leopard 2.

In March 1994, the Spanish Ministry of Defense created "Programa Coraza 2000" (Program Breastplate 2000), which focused on the procurement and integration of new armament for the Spanish army's modernization. The program included the Leopard 2E and the <a href="ASCOD%20AFV">Pizarro infantry combat vehicle</a>, as well as the <a href="Eurocopter%20Tiger">Eurocopter Tiger</a> attack helicopter. The program's scope extended to the integration of 108 Leopard 2A4s, which were leased to Spain in late 1995. Apart from procurement, "Programa Coraza" was meant to prepare the Spanish army logistically for the introduction of new matériel.

A <a href="memorandum%20of%20understanding">memorandum of understanding</a> was signed on 1995 between the German and Spanish governments, setting the foundations for an acquisition of up to 308 brand-new Leopard 2Es. These were to be assembled in Spain by Santa Bárbara Sistemas, with 60–70 percent of the components manufactured by Spanish companies, and production taking place between 1998 and 2003. Furthermore, the German government agreed to lend the Spanish army 108 for training purposes for a period of five years. These vehicles were delivered between November 1995 and June 1996. In 1998, Spain agreed to procure the ceded and reduce production of the brand-new Leopard 2E to 219 vehicles. In 2005 it was declared that the 108 Leopard 2A4s were to cost Spain just €16.9m, to be paid by 2016.

The equipped X and Infantry Brigade, which at the time formed part of <a href="Eurocorps">Eurocorps</a>. As production of the Leopard 2E began and these units received Leopard 2Es, their Leopard 2A4s re-equipped the "Alcántara" Armored Cavalry Regiment, based in <a href="Melilla">Melilla</a>.
Spain's Leopard 2E is based on the <a href="Leopard%202%23Leopard%202A6">Leopard 2A6</a>, and incorporates the add-on wedge armor of the <a href="Leopard%202%23Leopard%202A5">Leopard 2A5</a> on the turret. This armor maximizes the armor depth that a <a href="kinetic%20energy%20penetrator">kinetic energy penetrator</a> must travel through to enter the internal volume of the turret. Like the Swedish Leopard 2S (Strv 122), the Leopard 2E has increased armor thickness on the hull's glacis plate, the turret frontal arc and the turret roof, bringing the vehicle's weight close to 63 <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s (69.4 <a href="Short%20ton">tons</a>). The vehicle's protection is augmented by the added armor that is built into the tank during the manufacturing process, as opposed to being added on after assembly as is the case for German Leopard 2A5s and 2A6s. As a consequence, the Leopard 2E is one of the best-protected Leopard 2s in service.

The tank is armed with Rheinmetall's <a href="Rheinmetall%20120%20mm%20gun%23Rheinmetall%20L55%20120mm">L/55 tank-gun</a>, and is capable of adopting a gun. Both the tank commander and gunner have identical second generation thermal viewers, derived from those of the <a href="BGM-71%20TOW">TOW 2B</a> Light Launcher System. These are integrated into the tank by <a href="Indra%20sistemas">Indra</a> and <a href="STN%20Atlas">Rheinmetall Defense Electronics</a>. Indra provides the tank's command and control system, called the Leopard Information and Command Equipment (LINCE), based on the Swedish and German "Integrierte Führungssysteme" (IFIS). Other differences between the Spanish Leopard 2E and other Leopard 2A6s include an <a href="auxiliary%20power%20unit">auxiliary power unit</a>, manufactured by SAPA, an air conditioning system and new rubber pads for the vehicle's tracks to increase their lifespan on the irregular Spanish terrain. About 60% of each Leopard 2E was manufactured in Spain, as opposed to 30% for the Swedish Leopard 2S, for example.

Although the final contract for the production of Spanish Leopard 2Es was signed in 1998, calling for a production rate of four tanks per month, the first Leopard 2Es were not manufactured until late 2003. This was largely due to the merging of Santa Bárbara Sistemas with <a href="General%20Dynamics">General Dynamics</a>, and Krauss-Maffei's reservations regarding the sharing of the Leopard 2's technology with a rival company manufacturer of the <a href="M1%20Abrams">M1 Abrams</a>. Krauss-Maffei delivered 30 Leopard 2Es between 2003 and 2006. Production by Santa Bárbara Sistemas was delayed after assembly had begun; between January and November 2007, for example, only three of the 43 Leopard 2Es to be delivered to the Spanish army were actually delivered—with 15 more being delivered before the end of the year to make up for the earlier production problems. By 1 July 2006 the Spanish army had received 48 Leopard 2Es and nine <a href="Leopard%202%23Engineering%20and%20driver%20training%20tanks">Büffel armored recovery vehicles</a>, which was only a quarter of those contracted. Production of the Leopard 2E was planned to end by 2007 but was extended into 2008.

The Leopard 2E replaced the Leopard 2A4 in Spanish mechanized units, which in turn replaced M60s in cavalry units. Both versions of the Leopard 2 are expected to remain in service with the Spanish army until 2025. In terms of industrial scale, the production and development of the Leopard 2E represents a total of 2.6 million <a href="man-hour">man-hour</a>s of work, including 9,600 in Germany. It is one of the most expensive Leopard 2s built; the original contract was worth €1,910m but the final cost was €2,399m.

The Spanish army replaced its M60 Patton tanks and AMX-30s with the Leopard 2 between 1995 and 2008, a considerable improvement in capability. Previously, the Spanish army was equipped with M47 and M48 Patton tanks, which were upgraded to near M60 equivalency during the late 1970s and during the 1980s. Both the Leopard 2A4 and Leopard 2E sport a much more powerful gun than the AMX-30 and M60 tanks. The Leopard 2's 1,500 horsepower (1,110 kW) engine provides greater power than the M60A3's 750 horsepower (559.27 kW) and the AMX-30EM2's 850 horsepower (633.84 kW) engines. On the other hand, the Leopard 2 carries fewer, but larger rounds than the M60A3.

Ben Crosby

Benjamin Lewis Crosby, Jr. (March 22, 1868 – December 29, 1892) was an American <a href="American%20football">football</a> player, coach, and law student. Born in <a href="Halcott%2C%20New%20York">Halcott Centre, New York</a>, Crosby attended <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a> beginning in 1889; while there, he was a popular student and sportsman. He was a two-year starter on the <a href="Yale%20Bulldogs%20football">football team</a> and a backup on the <a href="Rowing%20%28sport%29">crew</a> team. During his junior year, he was replaced on the football team by freshman <a href="Frank%20Hinkey">Frank Hinkey</a> and never returned to a starting position. The remainder of Crosby's time at Yale was successful and he enrolled at the <a href="New%20York%20Law%20School">New York Law School</a> after graduation.

Crosby was invited in 1892 to serve as head coach of the <a href="Navy%20Midshipmen%20football">United States Naval Academy football program</a>. He accepted the position, and, using unusually rigorous practicing strategies, led the team to a 5–2 record, culminating in an <a href="Upset%20%28competition%29">upset</a> victory over rival <a href="Army%20Black%20Knights%20football">Army</a> in the <a href="Army%E2%80%93Navy%20Game">Army–Navy Game</a>. He received commendation for the victory, including a gift of a personalized trophy. Following the season's conclusion, Crosby returned to New York to continue his studies, but he was hospitalized after an illness he contracted while coaching worsened shortly after his arrival. He died from <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a> in late December, at the age of 24.

Crosby was born on March 22, 1868 in <a href="Halcott%2C%20New%20York">Halcott Centre</a>, <a href="Greene%20County%2C%20New%20York">Greene County, New York</a>, son of David J. Crosby. As a child, Crosby attended <a href="Hopkins%20School">Hopkins Grammar School</a> in <a href="New%20Haven%2C%20Connecticut">New Haven, Connecticut</a>, the second person in his family to do so; a cousin, James Parkman Crosby, had attended the institution in the early 1870s. Ben Crosby graduated from the school in 1888, and the following year, he began classes at <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a>. Crosby was popular while at Yale, and was a member of both <a href="Delta%20Kappa%20Epsilon">Delta Kappa Epsilon</a> fraternity and the secret undergraduate society <a href="Skull%20and%20Bones">Skull and Bones</a>. In his sophomore year, Crosby was the starting <a href="End%20%28gridiron%20football%29">right end</a> of the <a href="1890%20Yale%20Bulldogs%20football%20team">Bulldogs football team</a>. The squad finished that season with a thirteen-and-one win-loss record; the sole loss came to the national champion <a href="1890%20Harvard%20Crimson%20football%20team">Harvard</a>. Crosby joined the university's <a href="Crew%20%28sport%29">crew</a> team as a substitute the following year, and was described by classmates as being "quite prominent in athletics".

Early in the 1891 season, both Crosby and <a href="John%20A.%20Hartwell">John A. Hartwell</a>, the other starting end, who later followed Crosby as Navy football coach, were injured in a game. While observing a team practice, Hartwell and Crosby noticed the play of backup end <a href="Frank%20Hinkey">Frank Hinkey</a>. After watching Hinkey for a time, Hartwell decided to return to practicing for fear of losing his starting position; Crosby did not consider this necessary. By the next game, Hinkey had replaced Crosby as the starting end and he did not regain the position. The team finished the season with a <a href="Perfect%20season">perfect record</a> and would be retrospectively named <a href="College%20football%20national%20championships%20in%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS">national champions</a>. Crosby remained popular through his senior year at the university, and he was one of three graduates presented with a class award. Upon graduation from the school, Crosby enrolled in <a href="New%20York%20Law%20School">New York Law School</a> and joined a law office in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>.

In October 1892, shortly after he began attending New York Law School, Crosby was invited by former Yale coach <a href="Walter%20Camp">Walter Camp</a> to live in <a href="Annapolis%2C%20Maryland">Annapolis, Maryland</a> to serve as the coach for the <a href="Navy%20Midshipmen%20football">United States Naval Academy football team</a>; the program was acting in response to the appointment of Crosby's former teammate, <a href="Henry%20L.%20Williams">Henry L. Williams</a>, as coach for the <a href="Army%20Black%20Knights%20football">Army team</a>. Navy had first extended the offer to Camp, who suggested Crosby would fulfil the role more effectively. Crosby accepted the invitation, and became the second head coach in Navy history and the first who was independent of the program. The previous coach, <a href="Vaulx%20Carter">Vaulx Carter</a>, attended the academy, and had revived the program. Crosby's strategy for practices was one of the most intensive used at the academy during its early years; after classes every day, the team played two 45 minute games against a team of 22 backup players, followed immediately by a long swimming session in a cold pool. Shortly before the season began, Crosby hired former <a href="St.%20John%27s%20College%20%28Annapolis/Santa%20Fe%29">St. John's College</a>, <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20Blue%20Jays%20football">Johns Hopkins</a>, and <a href="Lehigh%20Mountain%20Hawks%20football">Lehigh</a> player <a href="Paul%20Dashiell">Paul Dashiell</a> to serve as his assistant coach.
The <a href="1892%20Navy%20Midshipmen%20football%20team">1892 season</a> commenced on October 12 with a 16–0 <a href="shutout">shutout</a> loss against the <a href="1892%20Penn%20Quakers%20football%20team">Penn Quakers</a> in Annapolis. The Quakers finished the season with a 15–1 record, losing only to national champion <a href="1892%20Yale%20Bulldogs%20football%20team">Yale</a>. Crosby's team played their next game three days later, against the <a href="1892%20Princeton%20Tigers%20football%20team">Princeton Tigers</a>. Navy lost the game in another shutout, by the score of 28–0. These losses continued a <a href="losing%20streak">losing streak</a> dating back to November 21 of the previous year. The following week, on October 22, Crosby achieved his first coaching win when Navy defeated the <a href="Lafayette%20Leopards%20football">Lafayette Leopards</a> 22–4. This was followed by a victory the next week over the small <a href="Franklin%20%26amp%3B%20Marshall%20Diplomats%20football">Franklin & Marshall College</a>; Navy won in a 24–0 shutout, their largest such win since the 1890 <a href="Army%E2%80%93Navy%20Game">Army–Navy Game</a>. They continued their <a href="winning%20streak%20%28sports%29">winning streak</a> into November with a 48–12 victory against <a href="Rutgers%20Scarlet%20Knights%20football">Rutgers</a>, the largest win for Navy since the beginning of the <a href="1890%20Navy%20Midshipmen%20football%20team">1890 season</a>. After a week's break, Crosby received his fourth win, a forty-point shutout of nearby <a href="Georgetown%20Hoyas%20football">Georgetown</a>.

The final game of the season was the annual Army–Navy Game against Navy's biggest <a href="List%20of%20sports%20rivalries">rivals</a>, the unbeaten Army Cadets. Navy had unexpectedly lost to the Cadets in the previous year's game, and came into the 1892 game as an <a href="underdog%20%28term%29">underdog</a>. Despite this, Crosby expected a victory, even telling reporters that he was "of the opinion that they [Navy] will certainly win". Crosby also caught the attention of the press with his scheduling of more frequent practices leading up to the game, including night practices on a lighted field. He closed all press and fan access to the practices, an unusual action at the time, because Navy officials claimed that Army had learned their <a href="American%20football%20plays">plays</a> the prior year by observing the practices. Crosby's actions proved effective as, on November 26 at <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">West Point</a>, Navy led Army for the entire game and won easily, 12–4. About a month after the game, in appreciation for his coaching Navy to the win, the team presented Crosby an eight-inch high sterling silver <a href="loving%20cup">loving cup</a>, produced by the <a href="Gorham%20Manufacturing%20Company">Gorham Manufacturing Company</a>, which was inscribed with the simple message: "Benjamin L. Crosby. Jr. – From the officers and cadets of the United States Naval Academy, Nov. 26, 1892".

When the season ended, Crosby returned to New York City to continue his studies at the New York Law School. He only attended classes for a brief time, because a serious illness he contracted in Annapolis continued to worsen. On December 19, while in the classroom, he reportedly "succumbed to an attack of <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a>". He was taken to <a href="St.%20Luke%27s-Roosevelt%20Hospital%20Center">St. Luke's Hospital</a>, where his condition progressively worsened over the following ten days. Crosby died on December 29, 1892 at the age of 24. Crosby's coaching position was filled by Yale teammate John A. Hartwell, who was subsequently replaced by another Yale teammate, <a href="William%20Wurtenburg">William Wurtenburg</a>.

In his one season as a head coach, Crosby amassed a record of 5–2 and his team outscored their opponents 146–64. The five wins are tied for the seventh-fewest of any Navy coach, but third-most of single-season coaches. Crosby also has the third-fewest losses among Navy coaches, while his .714 <a href="Winning%20percentage">win percentage</a> is tied for the tenth-highest of any Navy coach. Crosby has been largely forgotten outside of Navy football history. One event from his life that was remembered was his replacement as Yale end by Frank Hinkey, which was discussed in magazines until at least the 1920s due to Hinkey's influence on the sport. The most significant impact that Crosby had with Navy was through his hiring of Dashiell. The latter served as assistant until 1903 under the following eight Navy coaches. As head coach from 1904 to 1906, Dashiell brought Navy to national prominence and won 25 games.

William Wurtenburg

William Charles Wurtenburg (December 24, 1863 – March 26, 1957) was an American <a href="college%20football">college football</a> player and coach. Born and raised in <a href="Western%20New%20York">Western New York</a> to German parents, Wurtenburg attended the prestigious <a href="Phillips%20Exeter%20Academy">Phillips Exeter Academy</a>, where he played football. He enrolled in classes at <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a> in 1886 and soon earned a spot on the school's <a href="Yale%20Bulldogs%20football">football team</a>. He played for Yale from 1886 through 1889, and again in 1891; two of those teams were later recognized as national champions. His 35-yard run in a close game in 1887 against rival <a href="Harvard%20Crimson%20football">Harvard</a> earned him some fame. Wurtenburg received his medical degree from Yale's <a href="Sheffield%20Scientific%20School">Sheffield Scientific School</a> in 1893.

The following year, the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a> hired him to coach their football team. He led the squad to a 4–1–2 record for the season, including a 1–1–1 record against rival schools. He then accepted a coaching job at <a href="Dartmouth%20College">Dartmouth College</a>, where for the next four years he led them to perfect records against both of their <a href="Triangular%20Football%20League">Triangular Football League</a> opponents. They had a winning record the first year and a 5–2–1 record the second year. In 1899, his fifth season as coach, his team went 2–7 and lost both of its conference games.

After ending his coaching career, Wurtenburg spent several years acting as a <a href="Referee%20%28American%20football%29">referee</a> for Yale's football team. His final contribution to football was publishing a book about Yale football in the early 20th century. Around 1904, Wurtenburg began pursuing a career as a physician. He set up a medical office near his house in <a href="New%20Haven%2C%20Connecticut">New Haven, Connecticut</a>, and became an <a href="otorhinolaryngology">ear, nose and throat</a> specialist. Wurtenburg maintained his medical office until at least 1920. He died in 1957 at the age of 93, in New Haven.

William Wurtenburg was born on December 24, 1863, in <a href="Clarksburg%2C%20New%20York">Clarksburg</a>, a hamlet in <a href="Erie%20County%2C%20New%20York">Erie County, New York</a>. He was the son of George M. Wurtenburg and Elizabeth Hochschild, who immigrated from Germany in 1848. William attended primary school in the Clarksville public school system. For secondary schooling he attended the Griffith Institute in <a href="Springville%2C%20New%20York">Springville, New York</a> and then Forestville Academy before gaining admittance to <a href="Phillips%20Exeter%20Academy">Phillips Exeter Academy</a> in <a href="Exeter%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Exeter, New Hampshire</a>. At Phillips Exeter, Wurtenburg competed in <a href="Track%20and%20field">field events</a> at the school's spring athletic events. In 1884, he was a well-recognized member of the school's competitive football team. He served as <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> and team captain in 1885, leading the team to a 29–11 victory over rival <a href="Phillips%20Academy">Phillips Academy</a>. In his senior year, 1886, he placed first in <a href="Long%20jump%23Weight%20training">standing broad jump with weights</a> and <a href="Long%20jump">running broad jump</a>, with jumps of about , respectively. Upon graduation from Phillips Exeter, Wurtenburg entered <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a>.

Wurtenburg began taking medical classes on his arrival at Yale, and joined the <a href="Yale%20Bulldogs%20football">football team</a> partway through his freshman year. By the following season, he was playing backup <a href="Halfback%20%28American%20football%29">halfback</a> to freshman <a href="Harmon%20S.%20Graves">Harmon S. Graves</a>, although he occasionally filled in as a <a href="Fullback%20%28gridiron%20football%29">fullback</a>. The 1887 squad, later recognized as the <a href="College%20football%20national%20championships%20in%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS">national champion</a>, went 9–0 and outscored their opponents 515–12; this included a 106–0 shutout of <a href="Wesleyan%20Cardinals%20football">Wesleyan</a>. During this season Wurtenburg made his most famous play: with Yale leading <a href="Harvard%E2%80%93Yale%20football%20rivalry">rival</a> <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard</a> by a score of 11–8 late in the season's final contest, Wurtenburg made "a brilliant run" of 35 yards and scored a <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a>, which secured the game for Yale. He was credited as one of the people who made the game "undoubtedly the finest ever played in America", according to writer <a href="Richard%20Melancthon%20Hurd">Richard Melancthon Hurd</a>.
The following year Wurtenburg shifted into his former position at quarterback. He took the starting spot and became a leader of the team. Wurtenburg developed his own unique style at quarterback, regularly attempting "long, low, underhand passes" to his teammates to help set up scoring plays. That year, the Yale team shut out every single one of its opponents and was later recognized as a national champion. At the same time, Wurtenburg played on the school's baseball team, where he would regularly score three or four <a href="Run%20%28baseball%29">runs</a> a game. In September of his graduating year, 1889, Wurtenburg announced that he would be entering the <a href="Sheffield%20Scientific%20School">Sheffield Scientific School</a>. At the Exeter Club's first annual banquet, held that year, Wurtenburg was asked to present a toast to represent the club's athletics. In 1890, he served as the co-editor of "The Yale Banner", one of the school's <a href="yearbook">yearbook</a>s. Wurtenburg played his final season of football at the university in 1891, after apparently giving up his spot on the team following the 1889 season. However, he was thrown out of the final game of the season, against Princeton, and <a href="Frank%20Barbour">Frank Barbour</a> was given a guaranteed starting-quarterback slot for the rest of the time Wurtenburg was at Yale. Wurtenburg graduated in 1893, when he received his <a href="Doctorate%20in%20Medicine">Doctorate in Medicine</a> (M.D.).

In 1894, Wurtenburg was hired to replace former Yale teammate <a href="John%20A.%20Hartwell">John A. Hartwell</a> as the head coach of the <a href="Navy%20Midshipmen%20football">US Naval Academy football team</a>. Hartwell's 1893 team had amassed a record of 5–3, including a win over rival <a href="Army%20Black%20Knights%20football">Army</a> and a loss to rival <a href="Penn%20Quakers%20football">Penn</a>. Wurtenburg began his coaching career on October 6, leading his team to a 6–6 tie with the Elizabeth Athletic Club of New Jersey at <a href="Worden%20Field">Worden Field</a> on the Naval Academy campus in <a href="Annapolis%2C%20Maryland">Annapolis</a>. His first win as a coach came over two weeks later, on October 21, in a 12–0 <a href="shutout">shutout</a> of rival <a href="Georgetown%20Hoyas%20football">Georgetown</a>; it was followed by a defeat of the <a href="Carlisle%20Indian%20Industrial%20School">Carlisle Indian School</a>. His first and only loss of the season came on October 27, at the hands of rival Penn in a 12–0 shutout. At about that time, Wurtenburg left the country and traveled to Germany to complete his medical studies. The team recovered and defeated <a href="Lehigh%20Mountain%20Hawks%20football">Lehigh</a> on November 3, then tied rival <a href="Penn%20State%20Nittany%20Lions%20football">Penn State</a>. The season ended two weeks after that match with a 30–6 defeat of <a href="Baltimore%20City%20College">Baltimore City College</a>. The team did not compete against their <a href="Army%E2%80%93Navy%20Game">major rival</a> Army that year, after violent fights between fans the previous year; President <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a> banned the game, which would not be played again until it was reinstated in 1899 by <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>. Sometime during November, Wurtenburg returned from Germany along with fellow Yale medical graduate A.S. Cheney, and announced his intention to practice medicine in New Haven. That year, he received certification, and he expressed interest in eye, throat, and ear treatment.
Wurtenburg did not remain at the Naval Academy the following year and was replaced as head coach by <a href="Matthew%20McClung">Matthew McClung</a>. He instead accepted a position as the head coach of the <a href="Dartmouth%20Big%20Green%20football">Dartmouth team</a>, starting in the fall of 1895. The season began with a 50–0 shutout of his former school, Phillips Exeter. This was followed by a loss and a tie, which were succeeded by back-to-back wins. His team dropped two games to Yale and one to Army, but managed to defeat former <a href="Triangular%20Football%20League">Triangular Football League</a> opponent <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology%23Athletics">MIT</a>. After that, Wurtenburg led his team to three straight victories, including wins over both Triangular Football League opponents. Although the season ended with a loss to <a href="Brown%20University">Brown</a>, Dartmouth was awarded the Triangular Football League championship. On November 20 of that year, Wurtenburg married Anna Phillips, daughter of Jason W. Phillips, whom he met while at <a href="Chautauqua">Chautauqua</a> in 1893. The wedding took place at <a href="Springfield%2C%20Ohio">Springfield</a>, in Phillips' home state of Ohio; it was called "a brilliant event" by the "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">Boston Daily Globe</a>" and was attended by Ohio's governor-elect <a href="Asa%20S.%20Bushnell%20%28Governor%29">Asa S. Bushnell</a> and his wife. After the wedding, they moved to a permanent residence in New Haven.

He returned to coach Dartmouth the following year. He began by leading his team to a 30–0 shutout of the Worcester Athletic Club on October 3. His team dropped the next two games, both scoreless losses to Penn and Yale, but finished the month with a win. The second half of the season went much better, with Wurtenburg leading his squad to a 3–1 record, including a 42–0 total score against conference opponents. The team ended the season with a 5–2–1 record and a second consecutive conference championship. Wurtenburg retained his coaching position the next season, beginning the year with a blowout of Phillips Exeter, which was followed by three consecutive shutout losses. The team turned the season around in November, defeating Amherst and Williams by a combined score of 106–0 for a third consecutive championship. He ended the season with a 4–3 record and a secure position as the coach for the next year.

In 1898, Wurtenburg's Dartmouth squad went 5–6, but outscored their opponents 205–137. Beginning the season with a win over Phillips Exeter, the team went 4–1 in October. Wurtenburg's team began the month with a shutout loss to Harvard, but recovered to win four straight games, defeating their conference opponents by a combined score of 74–12. In November and December, however, his team lost all five matches, managing only 28 points. In his final year as a coach, Wurtenburg suffered the worst record of his career. After winning the first two games of the season, his team dropped the remaining seven, only able to put up 12 points. He also suffered his first conference losses, falling to opponents Williams and <a href="Wesleyan%20University">Wesleyan</a> by a combined score of 23–10. Wurtenburg was replaced as coach the following year by one of his former players, <a href="Frederick%20E.%20Jennings">Frederick E. Jennings</a>. After the conclusion of his coaching career, Wurtenburg opened up his first medical office, operating a short distance from his New Haven home.

Even after the turn of the century, Wurtenburg remained involved with the Yale football program. In 1900, he participated in the annual football team's spring scrimmage, playing on the school's "varsity" team. He was repeatedly selected by the university to act as an official in their home games; he was the school's <a href="Referee%20%28American%20football%29%23Referee">referee</a> in 1900 and 1901, and returned to the position two years later, in 1903. He expanded his officiating role in 1904, when he served in three games. For one of those matches, Wurtenburg moved to the position of <a href="Referee%20%28American%20football%29%23Umpire">umpire</a>. Sometime between 1915 and 1925, Wurtenburg collected a series of newspaper articles and self-published them in a book titled "Scrapbook of Newspaper Clippings about Yale Football". At some point around 1904, Wurtenburg began to dedicate himself to a career as a physician. He received official membership in the <a href="American%20Medical%20Association">American Medical Association</a> and the New Haven Medical Society as a physician specializing in <a href="otorhinolaryngology">otorhinolaryngology</a>, specifically in ear and nose treatment. By 1909, he had shifted his focus to the treatment of ear ailments, and occasionally served well-known locals. He retained his membership with the Connecticut State Medical Society until at least 1920, maintaining his Elm Street office the entire time. Wurtenburg died on March 26, 1957, in New Haven, at the age of 93. A year after his death, Yale established the William G. Wurtenberg Scholarship from his bequest. The scholarship "is to be awarded to a member of the senior class who demonstrates character, leadership qualities, and promise of future usefulness". Although rarely acknowledged for his influence on Dartmouth football, Wurtenburg is considered by his Dartmouth peers as having brought the program to prominence. <a href="Fred%20Crolius">Fred Crolius</a>, captain of Wurtenburg's 1898 team, would later state that:

2002 Bou'in-Zahra earthquake

The 2002 Bou'in-Zahra earthquake (also known as the 2002 Avaj earthquake or the 2002 Changureh earthquake) occurred on 22 June 2002. The <a href="epicenter">epicenter</a> was near the city of <a href="Bou%27in-Zahra">Bou'in-Zahra</a> in <a href="Qazvin%20Province">Qazvin Province</a>, a region of northwestern <a href="Iran">Iran</a> which is crossed by several major <a href="Fault%20%28geology%29">faults</a> that is known for destructive earthquakes. The shock measured 6.5 on the scale, had a maximum <a href="Mercalli%20intensity%20scale">Mercalli intensity</a> of VIII ("Severe"), and was followed by more than 20 <a href="aftershocks">aftershocks</a>. At least 261 people were killed and 1,500 more were injured.

According to the International Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology (<a href="IIEES">IIEES</a>), the earthquake was felt as far away as the capital city of <a href="Tehran">Tehran</a>, approximately east of the epicenter, although no damage was reported there. Most houses in the region were single-story <a href="masonry">masonry</a> buildings, and virtually all of these collapsed. The public became angry due to the slow official response to victims who needed supplies. Residents of the town of <a href="Avaj">Avaj</a> resorted to throwing stones at the car of a government minister.

The northeastern part of Iran lies across part of the belt of active <a href="continental%20collision">continental collision</a> between the <a href="Arabian%20Plate">Arabian Plate</a> and the <a href="Eurasian%20Plate">Eurasian Plate</a>. Iran is crossed by several major <a href="Fault%20%28geology%29">faults</a>, with 90% of them being seismically active and subject to many earthquakes each year; the area around the rupture experiences minor quakes almost daily. The most seismically active parts of this area are the <a href="Zagros%20fold%20and%20thrust%20belt">Zagros fold and thrust belt</a> and the <a href="Alborz">Alborz</a> mountain range. <a href="Qazvin%20Province">Qazvin Province</a>, which is located between these two zones, suffers less earthquakes, but these may be more powerful because stresses have longer to build.

The Bou'in-Zahra earthquake was located in an area of active <a href="thrust%20fault">thrust fault</a>ing and <a href="Fold%20%28geology%29">folding</a>, parallel and south of the southern edge of the Alborz mountain range, and was the 11th rupture in the previous two months in central Iran. A <a href="Linear%20seismic%20inversion">seismic inversion</a> of long-period P and SH <a href="body-wave%20seismograms">body-wave seismograms</a> indicated a rupture on a thrust fault that dips 49 degrees to the southwest and had a <a href="centroid">centroid</a> depth of roughly . The rupture's <a href="focal%20mechanism">mechanism</a> of faulting was reverse.

Multiple-event relocation of the main shock and aftershock epicenters and discontinuous surface ruptures recorded after the earthquake are compatible with northeastward movement on a southwest-dipping thrust, although maximum recorded displacements were less than would have been expected from the observed magnitude. This suggests that most of the slip did not actually reach the Earth's surface but caused folding at the surface. A previously unmapped thrust with little surface expression, the Abdareh fault, has been identified from the disruption of earlier drainage systems by the growth of the fold in its hanging wall, and is thought to be responsible for the earthquake. Such structures are known as <a href="Thrust%20fault%23Blind%20thrust%20faults">blind thrusts</a>, and have been responsible for many destructive earthquakes in Iran and elsewhere. The geomorphological effects of this particular fold have been partly obscured by the presence of an earlier <a href="Neogene">Neogene</a> topography. The <a href="Qazv%C4%ABn%20Province">Qazvin region</a> was hit by an even <a href="1962%20Bou%27in-Zahra%20earthquake">greater earthquake</a> in 1962, which killed 12,200. In 1990 a <a href="1990%20Manjil%E2%80%93Rudbar%20earthquake">rupture</a> killed over 40,000 people, injured 60,000, and left more than 500,000 homeless.

The earthquake occurred at 02:58 <a href="UTC">UTC</a> (7:28 a.m. <a href="Iran%20Standard%20Time">Iran Standard Time</a>), while many of the estimated 60 million Iranians affected were in their homes. Its duration was seven seconds, and the epicenter was near the settlement of Bou'in-Zahra in the Khar river valley, a mountainous farming region about from the provincial capital of <a href="Qazvin">Qazvin</a>. The greatest damage was across an area best known for its seedless grape harvesting, a getaway for wealthy residents of Tehran. At least 261 people were killed, 1,500 injured, and 25,000 left homeless. An earlier death toll was reported as 500, but this number was believed to be inflated once it became known that some of the severely injured had been mistaken for dead. Most of the dead were women, children and the elderly, as many of the men were working in local vineyards. Over 20 aftershocks were recorded, with magnitudes up to 5.1 on the moment magnitude scale. At least three of these caused further casualties and damage, most of which were within a radius of the main shock.

An estimated 5,000 buildings were damaged beyond repair. In the Qazvin province, 120 buildings were demolished and 50 villages suffered massive damage. In the neighboring Hamadan province, 45 villages were destroyed. A large majority of houses in the region were single-story <a href="masonry">masonry</a> buildings, and virtually all of these collapsed. As non-engineered structures, these could not withstand seismic forces, with structural failure and collapse resulting from wall-to-wall separation and the lack of structural integrity and of a proper lateral system of resisting. Newer structures built in accordance with the Iranian code of practice for <a href="Earthquake%20engineering">seismic-resistant design</a> fared much better. Damage to the historic <a href="Kharraqan%20towers">Kharaqan</a> tomb towers, which were in a good state of preservation before the event, suggests that the earthquake was possibly one of the most powerful in the region for approximately 900 years.

At a station from the epicenter, the maximum horizontal and vertical accelerations were recorded to be roughly 0.5 <a href="Standard%20gravity">g</a> and 0.26 g. A bridge collapsed as a result of the disaster. Water and irrigation systems were severely damaged near the epicenter, and water facilities were demolished in nine villages. Many of the main water pipelines in the affected areas were damaged or destroyed, causing inadequacies in water availability and quality. Surface cracks were observed in <a href="Ab%20Darreh%2C%20Qazvin">Ab Darreh</a> and <a href="Changureh%2C%20Buin%20Zahra">Changureh</a>, the villages that suffered the heaviest damage, being roughly from the epicenter.

The relatively low levels of damage in the towns of Avaj or Ab-e-Garm in comparison to Changureh and Ab Darreh suggest a focus of damage to the northwest of the epicenter due to northwest propagation. In Changureh, only two buildings were left standing and over 120 casualties occurred. Ab Darreh also fared poorly; the disaster destroyed the town's only <a href="mosque">mosque</a>, toppled 40 homes and killed at least 20 people. North of <a href="Avaj">Avaj</a>, in the village of <a href="Esmailabad%2C%20Buin%20Zahra">Esmailabad</a>, survivors recovered 38 corpses, a ninth of the total population, while searching for the missing, feared trapped in the ruins. In another village in the vicinity, <a href="Aliabad%2C%20Avaj">Aliabad</a>, two shepherds were the only known survivors. In the small village of Kisse-Jin, roughly 80 corpses were recovered following the rupture. Survivors crying and beating their heads and faces over loved ones were a common sight on Iranian state television.

The cost of the damage was estimated at US$91 million. The quake was felt across a wide area, including the provinces of Qazvin, <a href="G%C4%ABl%C4%81n%20Province">Gilan</a>, <a href="Kurdistan%20province%20%28Iran%29">Kurdistan</a>, <a href="Zanjan%20Province">Zanjan</a>, and <a href="Hamad%C4%81n%20Province">Hamedan</a>. Of all these, Qazvin was the most heavily damaged, with an unnamed Qazvin official reporting that 177 had died in the province. It was also felt in the capital of <a href="Tehran">Tehran</a>, roughly east of the epicenter, although no serious damage was reported. However, Iranian journalist Borzou Daragahi reported that in Tehran he saw buildings sway and glass objects shatter.

The Bou'in-Zahra earthquake triggered 59 landslides over an area of about . Landslides formed due to the quake included 47 <a href="Landslide%20classification%23Falls">falls</a> and <a href="Landslide%20classification%23Topples">topples</a>, nine <a href="Landslide%20classification%23Slides">slides</a>, and three lateral <a href="Landslide%20classification%23Spreads">spreads</a>. The largest of these slides was a rockslide, 150 × 100 m (490 × 330 ft), which occurred southeast of Changureh. Landslides triggered by the quake occurred more often in the geologic areas most susceptible to damage, where there were many landslides before.

The <a href="Red%20Crescent%20Society">Red Crescent Society</a> sent relief workers, <a href="detection%20dog">detection dog</a>s, 100 tons of food, 1,000 tents, 2,500 blankets, and mobile kitchens to the earthquake-stricken area. In addition, the <a href="Military%20of%20Iran">Iranian army</a> supplied soldiers, machinery and water trucks. To prevent the spread of disease, villages were sprayed with disinfectants and their inhabitants were given <a href="tetanus">tetanus</a> shots, among other measures. After Iranian officials launched an appeal for assistance, the <a href="United%20Nations%20Development%20Programme">United Nations Development Programme</a> supplied $50,000. The United Nations' Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) mobilised a United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team, deploying five members. <a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II">Pope John Paul II</a> prayed for the earthquake victims and asked for a "generous" response.

<a href="United%20States">United States</a> President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> offered aid to Iran, which he had previously called part of an "<a href="axis%20of%20evil">axis of evil</a>". According to him, "human suffering knows no political boundaries" and he stood "ready to assist the people of Iran as needed and as desired". However, the Iranian government refused his help, though it called for the help of non-governmental agencies.

According to Hossein Rahnema, head of the Red Crescent in Changureh, the society "levelled an area to put up tents but most people wanted to stay next to their houses to look after their property". Survivors instead lit small fires amongst the rubble to protect against freezing temperatures. The Iranian President at the time, <a href="Mohammad%20Khatami">Mohammad Khatami</a>, declared three days of mourning and visited earthquake-stricken areas on June 25. Hospitals struggled to cope with the surplus of patients, discharging non-critical ones from their wards. The <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> stated that 20 funerals were held on June 23, 2002 at a cemetery overlooking the village of Abdareh. A bank account was started to handle public donations for the families of the dead.

Often armed with no more than shovels and spades, soldiers and civilians dug for bodies in the rubble. Other than this, rescue workers were faced with a number of obstacles, including the temperatures of the villages damaged. They were warm during the day, although the villages grew colder at night, making rescue work harder and threatening the health of the homeless and anyone alive and trapped under the debris. Many civilians were discouraged from helping due to fear of aftershocks. According to Gary Oshea of International Rescue, the volunteers did not have enough technical equipment, and the religious leaders seemed unwilling to contribute much. Official rescue work ended on June 24, 2002, when rescue workers said there were no more survivors.

Of the roughly 80 villages that suffered heavy damage, the Iranian government claimed that relief work was mostly complete. Residents of Changureh, however, complained that tents, food, and medicine had not reached them, after waiting in near-freezing temperatures. A man from Avaj stated that only locals helped uncover the body of his child. In protest at Iran's slow response to the tragedy, some 300 people blocked the main road through Avaj. On June 23, "dozens" of Avaj residents threw stones at Interior Minister <a href="Abdolvahed%20Mousavi-Lari">Abdolvahed Mousavi-Lari</a>'s car in anger at the government's delay in providing relief. They also claimed that the death toll was higher than official reports said it was.

Electricity was restored to affected areas by June 25.
On November 9, 2002, the <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a> granted $225 million towards the reconstruction and economic rehabilitation of the area devastated by the quake. Reconstruction of housing and infrastructure by provincial authorities was interrupted for almost four months (November 2002 – February 2003) due to harsh weather conditions. In August 2003, the reconstruction was completed in all villages affected by the earthquake.

Scoops (magazine)

Scoops was a weekly British <a href="science%20fiction%20magazine">science fiction magazine</a> published by <a href="C.%20Arthur%20Pearson">Pearson's</a> in <a href="Tabloid%20%28newspaper%20format%29">tabloid</a> format in 1934, edited by <a href="Haydn%20Dimmock">Haydn Dimmock</a>. "Scoops" was launched as a boy's paper, and it was not until several issues had appeared that Dimmock discovered there was an adult audience for <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a>. Circulation was poor, and Dimmock attempted to change the magazine's focus to more mature material. He reprinted <a href="Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>'s "<a href="The%20Poison%20Belt">The Poison Belt</a>", improved the cover art, and obtained fiction from British science fiction writers such as <a href="John%20Russell%20Fearn">John Russell Fearn</a> and Maurice Hugi, but to no avail. Pearson's cancelled the magazine because of poor sales; the twentieth issue, dated 23 June 1934, was the last. The failure of the magazine contributed to the belief that Britain could not support a science fiction magazine, and it was not until 1937, with "<a href="Tales%20of%20Wonder%20%28magazine%29">Tales of Wonder</a>", that another attempt was made. 

In the early twentieth century, British boys' <a href="story%20papers">story papers</a> such as "<a href="The%20Magnet">The Magnet</a>" and "<a href="Boy%27s%20Magazine">Boy's Magazine</a>" ranged over many different genres, including <a href="school%20fiction">school fiction</a>, adventure, sports, and occasionally <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a>; the magazines were popular but the quality of the fiction was low. Science fiction also sometimes appeared in magazines aimed at the adult market, such as "<a href="Pearson%27s%20Magazine">Pearson's Magazine</a>", launched in 1896 by the British publishing firm of <a href="Sir%20Arthur%20Pearson%2C%201st%20Baronet">C. Arthur Pearson</a>, which intermittently carried science fiction by writers such as <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H.G. Wells</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>, and <a href="George%20Griffith">George Griffith</a>. In 1933, <a href="Odhams%20Press">Odhams</a>, a British publisher, began serializing <a href="Edgar%20Rice%20Burroughs">Edgar Rice Burroughs</a>' novels of <a href="Amtor">adventure on Venus</a> in their weekly magazine, "<a href="The%20Passing%20Show%20%28magazine%29">The Passing Show</a>". Odhams and Pearson's were rivals, and Pearson's decided to try a weekly science fiction magazine of their own, launching a boys' paper devoted to the genre the following year. Speaights, a printing firm, agreed to accept lower rates for printing "Scoops", in order to keep their presses running.
The editor responsible for the new magazine was <a href="Haydn%20Dimmock">Haydn Dimmock</a>, the editor of "<a href="The%20Scout%20%28magazine%29">The Scout</a>", and later the originator of "<a href="Bob%20a%20Job%20Week">Bob-a-Job Week</a>". Dimmock (who probably did not select the fiction himself) assumed that "Scoops"' readership would be young, and that no adults would be interested in reading it. His editorial in the first issue declared that "Scoops" would publish stories that "look ahead with the vision of <a href="Jules%20Verne">Jules Verne</a> and H.G. Wells, whose fiction stories of wonder and science, declared impossibilities at the time of publication, are now fact. "Scoops" ... will transport its readers from the everyday happenings into the future, with all its exceptions of development and discovery. ... "Scoops" will endeavour to anticipate the marvels of the age in which we live." It is possible that Dimmock and his staff were aware of American science fiction magazines, which were available in Britain as <a href="Remaindered%20book">remainders</a>, sold at stores such as <a href="F.%20W.%20Woolworth%20Company">Woolworth's</a>, but if so they did not understand the new genre, instead relying on boys' fiction writers to fill the magazine. Bernard Buley, who worked as the managing editor for "Scoops", was one of these, contributing "Master of the Moon", which was serialized over the first eleven issues; Buley had been the editor of "Boys' Magazine", which had ceased publication in January 1934. Other contributors included George E. Rochester, Stuart Martin, J.H. Stein, and Reginald Thomas, whose "The Striding Terror", about a child who grew to fifty feet tall, was serialized in the first eight issues. The stories were initially anonymous, but later research by <a href="W.%20O.%20G.%20Lofts">W.O.G. Lofts</a> has identified most of the authors. The term "science fiction" was not used initially; "science stories" was how "Scoops" described its contents, which included stories about scientific inventions and aviation among other subgenres. Dimmock and Buley asserted that "Scoops" provided educational scientific content, a claim also made by <a href="Hugo%20Gernsback">Hugo Gernsback</a>, who had been involved in launching the science fiction magazine genre in the US, though in the case of "Scoops" there was very little justification. Filler material was included with information about inventions and technology, but there was little coverage of scientific topics.

Dimmock made an exception to the rule that authors were anonymous for <a href="Archibald%20Low">A.M. Low</a>, a well-known scientist and inventor who contributed a novel, "Space", serialized in ten instalments starting with the second issue. The science fiction historian Mike Ashley suggests that Low's novel, which describes three boys who accidentally travel to Mars, "must have evoked considerable interest amongst the youth of 1934", but adds that "the other stories were not of that quality". British science fiction writers and fans such as <a href="John%20Russell%20Fearn">John Russell Fearn</a>, Walter Gillings, and P. E. Cleator, one of the founders of the <a href="British%20Interplanetary%20Society">British Interplanetary Society</a>, contacted Pearson's and made Dimmock aware that the market for the genre was broader than he had realized, and that there were specialist writers who might submit stories to "Scoops". Cleator had already supplied an article to Dimmock on interplanetary travel, and he began a column on the same topic. Pearson's knew that "Scoops" circulation was falling, and made the attempt to change course. Dimmock began to include the names of the authors on the stories, the cover was redesigned for the thirteenth issue (dated 5 May), and fiction was obtained from Fearn, Maurice Hugi, and W.P. Cockcroft. Cockcroft's "Cataclysm", in the 28 April issue, proved popular, and a sequel, "City of Mars", appeared in the 19 June issue. Conan Doyle's "The Poison Belt", which began in the 5 May issue, was "unquestionably the finest story to appear in "Scoops"" according to the science fiction historian Everett Bleiler; it had originally appeared in "<a href="The%20Strand%20Magazine">The Strand Magazine</a>" in 1913. However, most of the fiction was little improved. The cover art was mostly unsigned, but Serge Drigin contributed the first two covers, and E.P. Kinsella was responsible for one. The cover art improved after the change in policy, with <a href="rotogravure">rotogravure</a>d covers and more realistic depictions.

The changes Dimmock made did not reverse the trend. Dimmock later told Gillings that "demand was not sufficient to give us confidence for the future", and Pearson's closed the magazine down. The last issue was dated 23 June 1934. Bleiler records that Speaights also found more profitable work for their presses, and this contributed to Pearson's decision. Although it had never been targeted at adult readers, the failure of "Scoops" made it appear that Britain was not a viable market for a science fiction magazine. There was apparently enough British interest in American science fiction for Hugo Gernsback to devote the letter column of the August 1935 issue of "<a href="Wonder%20Stories">Wonder Stories</a>" to letters from British readers, but when one of those letters, from James Dudley, suggested that the time was right for a British publisher to start a science fiction title, the editor, <a href="Charles%20Hornig">Charles Hornig</a>, replied that "Scoops"' failure "proved to us and other British publishers that [the UK] is not yet prepared to support a professional science-fiction magazine enough to make it pay for itself". Gillings later described "Scoops" as "the biggest blunder that British science fiction ever made", but, in Bleiler's opinion, the British market was not economically capable of supporting a science fiction magazine at the time. Despite the setback, another publisher, <a href="George%20Newnes">Newnes</a>, considered launching a science fiction magazine in 1935, though their plans were delayed until 1938. Gillings himself was the editor of the next British science fiction title, "<a href="Tales%20of%20Wonder%20%28magazine%29">Tales of Wonder</a>", which published its first issue in 1937, while Newnes' magazine, "<a href="Fantasy%20%281938%20magazine%29">Fantasy</a>", appeared the following year.

"Scoops" was published by C. Arthur Pearson of London. The schedule was weekly; the first issue was dated 10 February 1934, and the run ended on 23 June 1934 with the twentieth issue. Haydn Dimmock was the editor for all of Pearson's juvenile papers, including "Scoops", though he was not credited in the magazine. Bernard Buley was on the editorial staff, taking on the role of the managing editor. "Scoops" was printed in tabloid format; each issue was 28 pages and was priced at <a href="%C2%A3sd">2d</a>. The print run was 100,000 copies weekly. Distribution was weak, and the magazine is now rare and commands high prices.

Five stories from "Scoops", along with eight other new stories, appeared in a 1937 collection from Pearson's titled "The Boys' World of Adventure"; the illustrations from "Scoops", by Serge Drigin, were included; the new stories might have been bought for "Scoops" prior to its demise.

Meerkat Manor: The Story Begins

Meerkat Manor: The Story Begins is a 2008 <a href="television%20movie">television film</a> created by <a href="Discovery%20Channel">Discovery Films</a> and <a href="Oxford%20Scientific%20Films">Oxford Scientific Films</a> as a <a href="prequel">prequel</a> to the <a href="Animal%20Planet">Animal Planet</a> series "<a href="Meerkat%20Manor">Meerkat Manor</a>". A scripted documentary narrated by <a href="Whoopi%20Goldberg">Whoopi Goldberg</a>, the film details the life of a <a href="meerkat">meerkat</a> named Flower from birth to her becoming the leader of a meerkat group called the Whiskers. The film is based on the research notes of the <a href="Kalahari%20Meerkat%20Project">Kalahari Meerkat Project</a> and primarily uses wild meerkat "actors" to represent those in the story. Shot over two years at the Kuruman River Reserve in <a href="Northern%20Cape">Northern Cape</a>, <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, the film employed a much larger crew than the series. Some scenes were shot at a wildlife park in the United Kingdom, while others were created using camera tricks and trained film animals.

The 75-minute film premiered at the 2008 <a href="Tribeca%20Film%20Festival">Tribeca Film Festival</a> before its television premiere on Animal Planet on May 25, 2008. While it was praised for its cinematography, for maintaining the depth of coverage of the television series, and for its accessibility to newcomers to the series, it was criticized for not offering anything new to fans. The Kalahari Meerkat Project noted that the film was not completely accurate but praised it overall and recommended against analyzing it. Several reviewers praised Goldberg's narration, but the script was criticized as being too simplistic for adult viewers.

The meerkat <a href="List%20of%20Meerkat%20Manor%20meerkats%23Flower">Flower</a> is born in the <a href="Kalahari%20Desert">Kalahari Desert</a> on March 15, 2000, to Holly, the leader of a <a href="meerkat">meerkat</a> group called the <a href="List%20of%20Meerkat%20Manor%20meerkats%23Whiskers">Whiskers</a>. After an attack by a rival group, the <a href="List%20of%20Meerkat%20Manor%20meerkats%23Lazuli">Lazuli</a>, the Whiskers are forced to surrender their territory and move to a new home. A hawk kills Holly when Flower is a year old, and her father abandons the group to find a new mate. Flower's sister Viale becomes the group's matriarch and chooses <a href="List%20of%20Meerkat%20Manor%20meerkats%23Yossarian">Youssarian</a>, a roving male from the Lazuli, as her mate. Flower mates with Yossarian's brother, <a href="List%20of%20Meerkat%20Manor%20meerkats%23Zaphod">Zaphod</a>, but Viale kills the resulting pups and banishes Flower from the group, allowing her to return later. During a time of starvation and drought, Viale attempts to lead the group across a road to forage. As she crosses, she is struck and killed by a passing truck. As the Whiskers attempt to adjust to the loss of their leader, a snake approaches the group. Flower steps in to lead an attack to drive it off. In doing so, she becomes the new leader of the group. Zaphod returns to the group to be her mate, while Yossarian steps aside and leaves the group. Flower leads the Whiskers back to their original home, and after a brief battle, the Whiskers reclaim it from the Lazuli. At end of the film, an on-screen note describes Flower's death during the third season of "Meerkat Manor" and the children she left behind.

Created by <a href="Oxford%20Scientific%20Films">Oxford Scientific Films</a> for <a href="Discovery%20Channel">Discovery Films</a>, "Meerkat Manor: The Story Begins" is a <a href="prequel">prequel</a> biography of Flower, the central <a href="meerkat">meerkat</a> of the highly rated documentary series "<a href="Meerkat%20Manor">Meerkat Manor</a>". Caroline Hawkins, creator of the series, wrote the script using notes taken by <a href="Kalahari%20Meerkat%20Project">Kalahari Meerkat Project</a> researchers, including head researcher <a href="Tim%20Clutton-Brock">Tim Clutton-Brock</a>. Hawkins notes that Oxford Scientific Films believes the film is the first natural history prequel to be created. The film was directed by Chris Barker and <a href="Mike%20Slee">Mike Slee</a>, while <a href="Whoopi%20Goldberg">Whoopi Goldberg</a>, a known "Meerkat Manor" fan, provided the narration.

"Meerkat Manor" normally films episodes using a crew of only two or three people to avoid disturbing the meerkats; the film was shot over two years at the Kuruman River Reserve, where the <a href="Kalahari%20Meerkat%20Project">Kalahari Meerkat Project</a> that the meerkats are a part of is based, and employed a much larger crew. Breaking from the series' pure documentary format, the film does not include footage of the project meerkats depicted in the story. Instead, wild meerkat "actors" represented Flower and her family; Flower was depicted by approximately eight female meerkats. The camera crew sought out appropriately aged meerkats for each scene, then filmed them until they behaved in ways the script required.

While the majority of the meerkats filmed were partially <a href="Habituation">habituated</a>, the cinematographers had to move carefully to avoid scaring the animals. The crew used radios to keep in contact with one another as they followed the meerkat groups around. Although the park normally prohibits low-flying aircraft, the production crew was given permission to film for three days using a low-flying helicopter. Mounted to its front underside was a new type of camera that was not affected by the shaking of the helicopter. Full-color scenes depicting the birth of meerkat pups were obtained by filming captive meerkats at the <a href="Cotswold%20Wildlife%20Park">Cotswold Wildlife Park</a> in the United Kingdom.

Because of the viewer backlash Animal Planet received for allowing meerkats from the "Meerkat Manor" series to die, the producers of the film debated including the filmed death of a young meerkat who was bitten by a snake. They questioned whether viewers would understand that the meerkats were wild animals and that human interference would disrupt the animals' natural life cycles. In addition, to avoid disrupting the research, crews are only allowed to film within the research area under a strictly enforced agreement not to interfere with the meerkats' lives. The producers ultimately included the scene, but the meerkat's cries for help as it lay dying were edited out. Other meerkat deaths depicted were reenactments. For Viale's death scene, the crew rigged a camera mounted on a platform on the side of a truck. Robin Smith, the film and series main cinematographer, hung partially out of the truck to hold the camera steady, giving the visual impression of a truck bearing down on a meerkat. To provide bird and snake footage, professional <a href="Wrangler%20%28profession%29">handlers</a> were employed, ensuring the meerkats were not deliberately put in danger.

In 2007, the real Flower was killed by a snake bite—before the film and the third series of "Meerkat Manor" had finished shooting. According to Executive producer Mick Kaczorowski, Flower's death imposed the need for a "bigger" ending to the film than the producers originally planned; Flower's death was addressed and the coda added.

The film premiered at the 2008 <a href="Tribeca%20Film%20Festival">Tribeca Film Festival</a> on April 30 in the Spotlight section, before airing in the United States on <a href="Animal%20Planet">Animal Planet</a> on May 25. Its television premiere was followed by the 30-minute "Making of Meerkat Manor: The Story Begins" special. The film was screened at the 2008 <a href="Festival%20du%20film%20britannique%20de%20Dinard">Festival du film britannique de Dinard</a> in France, as "The Meerkats", and at the <a href="Wildscreen%20Festival">Wildscreen Festival</a> in <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a> on October 18 and October 24, 2008.

It was released to <a href="DVD%20region%20code%231">Region 1</a> <a href="DVD">DVD</a> in North America on June 3, 2008, with the "Making of ... " special included as an extra. The DVD also includes another special, "The Science of Meerkat Manor", giving viewers a look at how the Kalahari Meerkat Project researchers work with the meerkats. It is scheduled for Region 2 DVD release in the United Kingdom on November 2, 2009.

In 2009, the film was nominated by the <a href="Cinema%20Audio%20Society%20Awards">Cinema Audio Society</a> for an award in the "Outstanding Achievement in Sound Mixing for DVD Original Programming" category, losing out to the music documentary "<a href="If%20All%20Goes%20Wrong">If All Goes Wrong</a>". "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>"s Ronnie Scheib did not think that "Meerkat Manor: The Story Begins" offered anything new for viewers of the television series, feeling that it was a "re-edited, re-scored, re-narrated" version of the existing series. While he found Goldberg's narration to be higher quality than in most documentaries of this type, he also felt that it "pales after a while." Scheib praised the film for its cinematography and the depth and quality of coverage of the meerkats, and said their activities "constantly amaze", while noting that the film was a condensed and embellished version of actual events that did not distort the meerkats' story. The Friends of the Kalahari Meerkat Project, a sponsorship for the research group studying the meerkats, thought the film was a "heart-touching tribute to Flower, with amazing meerkat, landscape and wildlife footage". Though the group noted that the film changes some details from the life history reports it was based on, they felt the film should be enjoyed rather than analyzed. Common Sense Media reviewer Emily Ashby felt the film was accessible to fans and newcomers to the series; she praised the story's scope and emotional impact, calling it a "captivating journey" that did not avoid depicting the "harsh facts of life in the wild". David Lowe from "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">The Sun</a>" found the film to be "charming" and a "fantastic documentary [that] manages to be both educational and incredibly entertaining."

Oryzomys antillarum

Oryzomys antillarum, also known as the Jamaican rice rat, is an <a href="extinction">extinct</a> <a href="rodent">rodent</a> of <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>. A member of the genus "<a href="Oryzomys">Oryzomys</a>" within the family <a href="Cricetidae">Cricetidae</a>, it is similar to "<a href="Oryzomys%20couesi">O. couesi</a>" of mainland Central America, from where it may have dispersed to its island during the <a href="last%20glacial%20period">last glacial period</a>. "O. antillarum" is common in <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a> cave faunas and is also known from three specimens collected live in the 19th century. Some historical records of Jamaican rats may pertain to it. The species probably became extinct late in the 19th century, perhaps due to the <a href="introduced%20species">introduction</a> of the <a href="small%20Asian%20mongoose">small Asian mongoose</a>, competition with introduced rodents such as the <a href="brown%20rat">brown rat</a>, and <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat destruction</a>.

"Oryzomys antillarum" was a medium-sized rat, similar in most respects to "Oryzomys couesi". The head and body length was and the skull was about long. The upperparts were reddish and graded into the yellowish underparts. The tail was about as long as the head and body, sparsely haired, and darker above than below. The species differed from "O. couesi" in having longer <a href="nasal%20bone">nasal bone</a>s, shorter <a href="incisive%20foramen">incisive foramina</a> (perforations of the front part of the <a href="palate">palate</a>), and more robust <a href="zygomatic%20arch">zygomatic arch</a>es (cheekbones).

In his 1877 <a href="monograph">monograph</a> on North American rodents, <a href="Elliott%20Coues">Elliott Coues</a> mentioned two specimens of "Oryzomys" from Jamaica in the collections of the <a href="United%20States%20National%20Museum">United States National Museum</a> (USNM). According to Coues, the specimens were similar to the <a href="marsh%20rice%20rat">marsh rice rat</a> ("Oryzomys palustris") of the United States, but different in color. Although he wrote that they probably represented a separate form, he refrained from giving a scientific name to them because of the possibility that the form had already received a name he did not know of. The species was first formally described by <a href="Oldfield%20Thomas">Oldfield Thomas</a> in 1898 based on a specimen that had been in the <a href="British%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">British Museum of Natural History</a> since 1845. He recognized it as a separate species of "<a href="Oryzomys">Oryzomys</a>", "Oryzomys antillarum", but wrote that it was related to the mainland Central American "<a href="Oryzomys%20couesi">O. couesi</a>". Thomas suspected that the species was already extinct on Jamaica, but that it or a similar rice rat could still be found in the unexplored interior of <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> or <a href="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a>.

Revising North American "Oryzomys" in 1918, <a href="Edward%20Alphonso%20Goldman">Edward Alphonso Goldman</a> retained "O. antillarum" as a separate species, but conceded that it was so similar to mainland "O. couesi" that it may have been introduced on Jamaica. In 1920, <a href="Harold%20Anthony">Harold Anthony</a> reported that remains of "O. antillarum" were common in coastal caves, suggesting that the species had previously been an important part of the diet of the <a href="barn%20owl">barn owl</a> ("Tyto alba"). In 1942, <a href="Glover%20Morrill%20Allen">Glover Morrill Allen</a> doubted that it was even a distinct species and in his 1962 Ph.D. thesis, Clayton Ray, who examined numerous cave specimens, agreed and retained it as only a "weakly differentiated subspecies" of "Oryzomys palustris" (which by then included "O. couesi" and other Mexican and Central American forms), "Oryzomys palustris antillarum". <a href="Philip%20Hershkovitz">Philip Hershkovitz</a> came to the same conclusion in a 1966 paper. After "O. couesi" of Mexico and Central America was again classified as a species distinct from the marsh rice rat ("O. palustris") of the United States, the Jamaican form came to be regarded as a subspecies of the former, "Oryzomys couesi antillarum".

In a 1993 review, Gary Morgan reinstated the animal as a distinct species closely related to "O. couesi", citing an unpublished paper by Humphrey, Setzer, and himself. <a href="Guy%20Musser">Guy Musser</a> and Michael Carleton, writing for the 2005 third edition of "<a href="Mammal%20Species%20of%20the%20World">Mammal Species of the World</a>", continued to classify the Jamaican form as part of "O. couesi", but did not reference Morgan. However, in a 2006 review of the contents of "Oryzomys", Marcelo Weksler and colleagues listed "O. antillarum" as a separate species, citing Morgan, and in a 2009 paper on western Mexican "Oryzomys" Carleton and Joaquín Arroyo-Cabrales did the same.

According to the classification by Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, "Oryzomys antillarum" is one of eight species in the genus "Oryzomys", which occurs from the eastern United States ("O. palustris") into northwestern South America ("<a href="Oryzomys%20gorgasi">O. gorgasi</a>"). "O. antillarum" is further part of the "O. couesi" <a href="section%20%28biology%29">section</a>, which is centered on the widespread Central American "O. couesi" and also includes various other species with more limited and peripheral distributions. Many aspects of the <a href="systematics">systematics</a> of the "O. couesi" section remain unclear and it is likely that the current classification underestimates the true diversity of the group. "Oryzomys" previously included many other species, which were progressively removed in various studies culminating in the 2006 paper by Weksler and colleagues, which excluded more than forty species from the genus. All are classified in the tribe <a href="Oryzomyini">Oryzomyini</a> ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily <a href="Sigmodontinae">Sigmodontinae</a> of family <a href="Cricetidae">Cricetidae</a>, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.

"Oryzomys antillarum" was a medium-sized rodent, about as large as "O. couesi". According to Thomas's description, the upperparts were reddish, slightly brighter on the rump and more grayish on the head. The color of the upperparts graded into that of the underparts, which were yellowish. The hairs of the underparts were grayish at the bases. The small ears were black on the outer and yellow on the inner side and the upper surfaces of the hands and feet were whitish. The tail was nearly naked and was light brownish above and lighter below. Goldman wrote that the specimens in the USNM were rather more reddish, but their color may have been altered because they had been preserved in alcohol. Coues had described these as rusty brown above and washed with the same color below. Andrew Arata compared the USNM specimens with examples of the reddish Florida subspecies of the marsh rice rat, "Oryzomys palustris natator", for Ray and found that they were more reddish than even the most strongly colored animals from Florida.

The skull was generally similar to that of "Oryzomys couesi", as were the teeth. It was robust and bore well-developed <a href="supraorbital%20ridge">supraorbital ridge</a>s (located above the eyes) on the <a href="braincase">braincase</a>. The <a href="interparietal%20bone">interparietal bone</a>, part of the roof of the braincase, was small and narrow. The bony <a href="palate">palate</a> extended beyond the third molars. The <a href="nasal%20bone">nasal bone</a>s extended further back than the <a href="premaxillary">premaxillaries</a>, whereas these bones are usually about coterminous in "O. couesi". On average, the <a href="incisive%20foramen">incisive foramina</a>, which perforate the front part of the palate, were shorter than in "O. couesi". The <a href="zygomatic%20arch">zygomatic arch</a> (cheekbone) appears to have been better developed in "O. antillarum".

In the three modern and numerous cave specimens, condylobasal length (a measure of skull length) varies from (one modern and two cave specimens only), length of the bony palate from , width of the <a href="interorbital%20region">interorbital region</a> (located between the eyes) from , length of the incisive foramina from , crown length of the upper molars from , and crown length of the lower molars from .

The oldest well-dated record of "Oryzomys antillarum" is at Drum Cave in the <a href="Jackson%27s%20Bay%20Cave">Jacksons Bay Caves</a> system, where it was found in a stratum <a href="radiocarbon%20dating">radiocarbon dated</a> to between 10,250 and 11,260 <a href="Before%20Present">years before present</a> according to a 2002 study. It is present in several other undated sites that predate the human colonization of the island, around 1,400 years before present. However, a site (Wallingford Roadside Cave) from the last interglacial, the <a href="Eemian">Eemian</a>, contains only the <a href="hystricognath">hystricognath</a> rodents "<a href="Clidomys">Clidomys</a>" and "<a href="Geocapromys%20browni">Geocapromys browni</a>" and lacks "Oryzomys". The presence of the rice rat on Jamaica before the arrival of humans disproves the hypothesis that it was introduced; instead, it must have reached the island by overwater <a href="biological%20dispersal">dispersal</a> through a <a href="rafting%20event">rafting event</a>, probably less than 125,000 years ago. During the <a href="last%20glacial%20period">last glacial period</a>, low sea levels would have exposed much land between Jamaica and Central America, substantially decreasing the distance needed for the ancestor of "O. antillarum" to arrive on the island and probably influencing sea currents so that rafts of vegetation from Central America would be more likely to reach Jamaica. Species of "Oryzomys" are <a href="List%20of%20semiaquatic%20tetrapods">semiaquatic</a> and closely associated with water, which may help to explain the occurrence of the genus on Jamaica. The rice rat has been found in many superficial, late <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> cave deposits, some of which have been radiocarbon dated to within the last 1,100 years. Its remains also occur in some <a href="Amerindian">Amerindian</a> archeological sites. From its common and widespread occurrence in caves, Ray suggested that the rice rat occurred in many different habitats before European contact. "O. antillarum" was the only <a href="Sigmodontinae">sigmodontine</a> rodent on any of the <a href="Greater%20Antilles">Greater Antilles</a>, where the rodent fauna otherwise consists solely of hystricognaths and introduced rodents.

Although there are some early historical records of the rats of Jamaica, very little is to be found in them regarding "Oryzomys antillarum", perhaps because the species declined rapidly following the European colonization of the island and because early authors failed to distinguish it from introduced rodents (the <a href="black%20rat">black rat</a>, "Rattus rattus"; <a href="brown%20rat">brown rat</a>, "Rattus norvegicus"; and <a href="house%20mouse">house mouse</a>, "Mus musculus"). <a href="Patrick%20Browne">Patrick Browne</a>, in the 1756 "Civil and Natural History of Jamaica", described a "House and Cane-Rat", a "Mouse", and a large "Water-Rat", which he said had been introduced to the island and become very common there.

In his "History of Jamaica" (1774), <a href="Edward%20Long">Edward Long</a> recognized four Jamaican rats: Browne's "Water-Rat", termed the "Charles-price rat", which Long regarded as identical with the European <a href="Arvicola">water vole</a> ("Arvicola"); the "black house-rat", said to have been brought from England; and two he said were indigenous. The larger of those was a grayish "cane-rat" and the smaller was a reddish "field-rat" as large as the English mole (the <a href="European%20mole">European mole</a>, "Talpa europaea"). Ray considered that the last may simply have been the house mouse, since the size of an English mole would be too small for "Oryzomys".

In "A Naturalist's Sojourn in Jamaica" (1851), <a href="Philip%20Henry%20Gosse">Philip Henry Gosse</a> listed the black and brown rat and the house mouse, as well as the "Cane-piece Rat", which he described as "Mus saccharivorus" and regarded as probably identical with Browne's "Water-Rat" and Long's "Charles-price Rat". He also mentioned the two species Long had listed as indigenous. Thomas and Ray both asserted that this "Cane-piece Rat" was most likely a brown rat, as judged from its measurements. Gosse wrote that an early explorer, Anthony Robinson, had described and pictured this species in an unpublished manuscript, on the basis of a specimen long, half of which consisted of the tail. Ray was unable to examine Robinson's manuscript, but suggested that Robinson's rat could not have been the brown rat, because that species did not reach the Americas until about 1800, and may instead have been "O. antillarum".

Gosse had collected the British Museum specimen of "Oryzomys antillarum" in 1845, but may not have separated it from introduced rats found with it. Coues noted that the two USNM specimens he examined were received after he had written the preceding part of his monograph; later, Thomas and others wrote that these specimens were obtained around 1877, but Ray asserted that they were taken before 1874. No specimens have been collected since.

"Oryzomys antillarum" probably became extinct about the 1870s and is currently listed as such by the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>. Its disappearance is usually attributed to the <a href="small%20Asian%20mongoose">small Asian mongoose</a> ("Herpestes javanicus"), which was introduced to Jamaica in 1872, and sometimes also to introduced "Rattus" species. Ray, on the other hand, argued that the significance of the mongoose had been overrated. Instead, he suggested that "Oryzomys antillarum" may have been affected by the massive environmental changes that occurred on the island after the British takeover in 1655. In that period, the bulk of the island came to be used for cultivation, so that the native habitat of "Oryzomys" was destroyed. Thus, "Oryzomys" was reduced to competition with introduced rats in man-made habitats, to which the latter are well adapted. Perhaps, Ray wrote, the black rat may not have been able to extirpate "Oryzomys", but the brown rat, a later and more assertive invader, brought it to extinction. Cats and dogs preying on "Oryzomys" may also have contributed to its demise.

Supernatural (season 2)

The second season of "<a href="Supernatural%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">Supernatural</a>", an American <a href="dark%20fantasy">dark fantasy</a> <a href="television%20series">television series</a> created by <a href="Eric%20Kripke">Eric Kripke</a>, premiered on September 28, 2006, and concluded on May 17, 2007, airing 22 episodes. The season focuses on protagonists <a href="Sam%20Winchester">Sam</a> (<a href="Jared%20Padalecki">Jared Padalecki</a>) and <a href="Dean%20Winchester">Dean Winchester</a> (<a href="Jensen%20Ackles">Jensen Ackles</a>) as they track down <a href="Azazel%20%28Supernatural%29">Azazel</a>, the demon responsible for the deaths of their mother <a href="Characters%20of%20Supernatural%23Mary%20Winchester">Mary</a> and father <a href="John%20Winchester%20%28Supernatural%29">John</a>. They attempt to discover the demon's plan for Sam and other <a href="Azazel%20%28Supernatural%29%23Plot">psychic children</a>—young adults who were visited by Azazel as infants and given abilities, and whose mothers often then died in a fire. During their travels, they use their father's journal to help them carry on the family business—saving people and hunting supernatural creatures.

The season aired on Thursdays at 9:00 pm <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">ET</a> in the United States, and was the first season to air on <a href="The%20CW">The CW</a> television network, a joint venture of <a href="The%20WB">The WB</a> and <a href="UPN">UPN</a>. The previous season was broadcast on The WB. It averaged only about 3.14 million American viewers, and was in danger of not being renewed. The cast and crew garnered many award nominations, but the episodes received mixed reviews from critics. While both the brotherly chemistry between the lead actors and the decision to finish the main storyline were praised, the formulaic structure of the episodes was criticized.

The season was internationally syndicated, airing in the United Kingdom on <a href="ITV%20Network">ITV</a>, in Canada on <a href="Citytv">Citytv</a> and <a href="Space%20%28Canadian%20TV%20channel%29">SPACE</a>, and in Australia on <a href="Network%20Ten">Network Ten</a>. It was released on <a href="DVD">DVD</a> as a six-disc <a href="box%20set">box set</a> September 11, 2007, by <a href="Warner%20Home%20Video">Warner Home Video</a> in <a href="DVD%20region%20code">Region 1</a>. Although the season was split into two separate releases in <a href="DVD%20region%20code">Region 2</a>, the complete set was released on October 29, 2007, and in <a href="DVD%20region%20code">Region 4</a> on October 3, 2007. The episodes are also available through digital retailers such as <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple</a>'s <a href="iTunes%20Store">iTunes Store</a>, Microsoft's <a href="Xbox%20Live%20Marketplace">Xbox Live Marketplace</a>, and <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>'s on-demand TV service.

The writers used the second season to expand upon the concept of hunters, resulting in the introduction of many recurring characters through the hunter-frequented saloon—Harvelle's Roadhouse. <a href="Samantha%20Ferris">Samantha Ferris</a> portrayed <a href="Ellen%20Harvelle">Ellen Harvelle</a>, proprietor of the Roadhouse and an old friend of <a href="John%20Winchester%20%28Supernatural%29">John Winchester</a>, while <a href="Alona%20Tal">Alona Tal</a> played Ellen's daughter <a href="Jo%20Harvelle">Jo</a>. This pair complemented the father-son relationship of the Winchesters in the first year. Ferris believes she was exactly what the producers were looking for: a "tough, strong, yet a little maternal actor". Tal's character, on the other hand, was an intended love interest for Dean, and was eventually phased out because she came off as more of a sister figure. <a href="Chad%20Lindberg">Chad Lindberg</a> portrayed the genius <a href="Characters%20of%20Supernatural%23Ash">Ash</a>, who uses his vast computer skills to track the paranormal. Because the writers felt the character's "comical" and "wacky" personality was too unrealistic for the show, he was also removed by the finale.
Other characters returned from the first year. Actor <a href="Jim%20Beaver">Jim Beaver</a> made multiple appearances as hunter <a href="Bobby%20Singer">Bobby Singer</a>, an old family friend of the Winchesters. Beaver had expected his first-season guest appearance in "<a href="Devil%27s%20Trap">Devil's Trap</a>" to be a "one-shot deal", and was surprised when he was asked to return. <a href="Adrianne%20Palicki">Adrianne Palicki</a> reprised her role as Sam's deceased girlfriend <a href="Characters%20of%20Supernatural%23Jessica%20Lee%20Moore">Jessica</a> in the alternate-reality episode "<a href="What%20Is%20and%20What%20Should%20Never%20Be%20%28Supernatural%29">What Is and What Should Never Be</a>", as did <a href="Samantha%20Smith%20%28actress%29">Samantha Smith</a> as <a href="Mary%20Winchester%20%28Supernatural%29">Mary Winchester</a>. Smith also made an appearance in a flashback in the penultimate episode, "<a href="All%20Hell%20Breaks%20Loose%20%28Supernatural%29">All Hell Breaks Loose, Part One</a>". And though at first reluctant because of his role on "<a href="Grey%27s%20Anatomy">Grey's Anatomy</a>", <a href="Jeffrey%20Dean%20Morgan">Jeffrey Dean Morgan</a> returned as <a href="John%20Winchester%20%28Supernatural%29">John Winchester</a> in the season premiere and finale. However, the character dies in the premiere because the writers worried that having him separated from his sons again—Sam and Dean spend much of the first season tracking him down—would "split the show" by having him away "doing more interesting things than the boys are doing". As a demon, the villain <a href="Azazel%20%28Supernatural%29">Azazel</a> periodically switches hosts, and was first fully portrayed by Morgan in the first-season finale. The reins passed to <a href="Fredric%20Lehne">Fredric Lehne</a> for the second-season premiere, and the show's producers enjoyed his performance so much they brought him back for the two-part finale.

Many factors went into the casting decisions of the season's guest stars. <a href="Linda%20Blair">Linda Blair</a>, famous for her role in the horror film "<a href="The%20Exorcist%20%28film%29">The Exorcist</a>", appeared in the episode "The Usual Suspects". Though a fan of the show, Blair had turned down a guest appearance in the first season because she did not want to return to horror, having spent years getting a "clean slate". This changed after the television series "<a href="Extra%20%28U.S.%20TV%20program%29">Extra</a>" aired a three-part profile on her acting career and work with animals. It attempted to find a series that would write a role for her as "an actor's piece", rather than a cameo. Kripke, a fan of "The Exorcist", offered to write an episode specifically for her, and she was "really touched" when he listened to her request to leave out demons in the storyline. During <a href="Dubbing%20%28filmmaking%29%23ADR.2Fpost-sync">automated dialogue replacement</a>, Jensen Ackles added in a reference to "The Exorcist" with the statement, "I could really go for some pea soup."

The casting of "<a href="Battlestar%20Galactica%20%282004%20TV%20series%29">Battlestar Galactica</a>" <a href="Tricia%20Helfer">Tricia Helfer</a> in "Roadkill" stemmed from the producers' preference to hire actors important to "Supernatural" fanbase. This was the first episode to have the Winchesters as supporting characters, and Kripke felt "Tricia had the charisma to perform the leading role". Kripke enjoyed <a href="Emmanuelle%20Vaugier">Emmanuelle Vaugier</a>'s work in television series such as "<a href="Smallville">Smallville</a>", and believed she was an "easy choice" for the large role of the soon-to-be werewolf Madison in "Heart". Director Kim Manners felt Vaugier brought to the character a vulnerability like that of <a href="Lon%20Chaney%2C%20Jr.">Lon Chaney, Jr.</a> in "<a href="The%20Wolf%20Man%20%281941%20film%29">The Wolf Man</a>", which made viewers sympathetic. Conspiracy-theorist Ronald of "Nightshifters" was envisioned by writer and consulting producer Ben Edlund as the unsympathetic "semi-drunk <a href="Randy%20Quaid">Randy Quaid</a> from "<a href="Independence%20Day%20%281996%20film%29">Independence Day</a>"". However, this changed with <a href="Chris%20Gauthier">Chris Gauthier</a>'s casting, and Edlund felt that Ronald turned out to be a "really cool" character fans would enjoy. The producers considered <a href="Summer%20Glau">Summer Glau</a> for the role of the zombie Angela for "Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things", but she could not accept due to scheduling conflicts.

When production of the second season started, Kripke wanted to avoid the <a href="Villain%20of%20the%20week">monster-of-the-week</a> formula used in the first year. The writers attempted this by including more "human themes," mainly "the things Sam and Dean are truly afraid of: death, grief, betrayal, etc." This change brought the series' focus onto situations such as the brothers dealing with their father's death and giving them the task of hunting down Azazel, the demon who killed him. Morgan feels that the brothers' "inner turmoil" created by the death of his character made them more three-dimensional. While Dean has trouble dealing with his father's death, Kripke wishes they had focused more on Sam's reaction. Instead, the episodes dealt more with Sam's fear of becoming evil, which Kripke regretted since the writers never depicted the character committing malevolent acts. Another main storyline of the season followed Sam and Dean as they track down the various <a href="Characters%20of%20Supernatural%23Azazel%27s%20special%20children">psychic children</a>—young adults like Sam who were visited by Azazel as infants and given abilities. However, the psychic children storyline made the mythology of the second season "dense" and "confusing" for Kripke.

Kripke instead favored the "unique and structurally interesting" self-enclosed episodes, which sometimes arose from the writers' unused ideas. From the series' beginning, Kripke desired to feature an <a href="evil%20clown">evil clown</a> because he felt that "clowns in a context where they're not supposed to be are friggin' terrifying". To fit with the series, the clown became a shapeshifting <a href="Rakshasa">Rakshasa</a> of <a href="Hindu%20mythology">Hindu mythology</a>. This decision made the clown "less satisfying", to Kripke's chagrin, because it limited the clown-related scenes. Another element of folklore favored by Kripke was the <a href="Robert%20Johnson%23Devil%20legend">story of Robert Johnson</a>, which he focused on in his first screenplay as a writer. He found the legend similar to "Supernatural", noting, "It's a piece of real life American history and folklore, it's an American horror story, it takes place on the dusty back roads of rural America, and it's got great music." However, the lore takes place in the early 20th century, and prevented the inclusion of Sam and Dean. To circumvent this, writer Sera Gamble suggested Johnson's story be made into a subplot detailed in flashbacks, with the Crossroads Demon returning in the present to make more <a href="Deal%20with%20the%20Devil">deals</a>. Although Gamble envisioned the demon's hellhound as being similar in appearance to a <a href="Rottweiler">Rottweiler</a>, Kripke felt it would "look stupid". The creature was instead made invisible, which Gamble believes gave it a more terrifying presence.

Before he entered the television industry, writer and consulting producer Ben Edlund had wanted to pen a <a href="metafiction">metafiction</a>al script dealing with television production, but decided against it because he did not have production knowledge. He later returned to it for the episode "Hollywood Babylon". Edlund decided to have the production staff look like "goofballs", and made fun of "Supernatural"s production staff, the network, and the studio. For example, comments made by <a href="Gary%20Cole">Gary Cole</a>'s "studio suit" character were based on notes from the network and studio for "Supernatural" during both seasons of production. Other metafictional references include a character commenting on the "terrible script" of "<a href="Boogeyman%20%28film%29">Boogeyman</a>", a film written by Kripke; Sam becoming uncomfortable as the studio tour passes the set of "<a href="Gilmore%20Girls">Gilmore Girls</a>", a television series in which Padalecki had a recurring role; and Sam proclaiming Hollywood's weather to be "positively Canadian".
Other stories were developed from simple concepts. For example, the reformed-vampire episode "Bloodlust" was developed to suggest that all monsters should not be killed indiscriminately. The plot alluded to "racial issues", but not blatantly; rather, as Padalecki noted, they explored it in a "fun way". The episode "The Usual Suspects" emerged from the writers' desire to keep the audience guessing. Cathryn Humphris pitched a story with a ghost serving as a <a href="Death-warning">death omen</a>—warning people of future tragedy, rather than trying to kill them, unlike previous ghosts on the series. However, Humphris had trouble developing the script's outline. Kripke noted a part of the episode in which brothers are arrested and have to explain to police what had happened; this scenario ultimately became the framework of the episode, which begins with Sam and Dean being taken into custody. The concept for "Tall Tales" originated as a "<a href="Argument">he said, he said</a>" episode, in which the brothers would recount conflicting versions of the same storyline. The writers deliberated over the use of five or six monsters in trying to find one appropriate for the episode, but eventually settled on a <a href="trickster">trickster</a> because it "can do everything [they] want it to". Although the writers typically prefer to put their own spin on folklore, they decided in this case to remain faithful to the archetypal trickster mythos. Because the season alluded to the possibility of Sam becoming bad, the writers wanted to portray how an evil Sam would behave and what Dean's reaction would be. One of the writers' first creative ideas of the season was depicted in the teaser of "Born Under a Bad Sign", in which a blood-covered Sam wakes up not remembering the past week of his life. The plot, which "fell into place" during the writing process, included <a href="demonic%20possession">demonic possession</a> to explain Sam's actions—an event that resulted in the return of the vengeful Meg Masters demon.

After the plotlines were developed, major deviations sometimes occurred in the writing process. Like in the final version of the script, twins with mind-control abilities were the focus of Edlund's original pitch for the episode "Simon Said". However, the more powerful twin—kept secluded due to deformities—forced his brother to perceive himself as retarded. At the end of the episode, his brother ate him in retaliation. The story was eventually changed, and instead focused on questions such as "What do you do with power?". Kripke felt that this fit greatly with the series' storyline, because Sam was uncomfortable with his developing abilities; the writers wanted to explore one of the psychic children who took his ability as a gift. "Folsom Prison Blues" stemmed from Kripke's desire to feature prison ghosts, and the initial plot had FBI Agent Henriksen finally capturing the brothers and sending them to prison. However, this caused a major complication: the writers would have to devise a way for Sam and Dean to escape in the end. Writer John Shiban suggested that the brothers be arrested on purpose in order to work a job, with the prison's head guard being revealed as a family friend.

The two-part finale "<a href="All%20Hell%20Breaks%20Loose%20%28Supernatural%29">All Hell Breaks Loose</a>" brought many storylines to a close. The psychic children were killed off because the writers felt the characters were not as interesting as demons and monsters. The Roadhouse was destroyed due to Kripke's disliking of the concept; he felt it gave a home to the road show. Fearing that he would disappoint fans by creating too much anticipation, Kripke also decided to answer many questions regarding Azazel's plans in "Part One". The second part ended the brothers' quest to kill Azazel, but also opened more storylines for the third season, such as Dean's demonic pact to resurrect Sam and the question of whether what returned was "one hundred percent pure Sam". Additionally, the "war of demons against humanity"—hinted at throughout the first two seasons—finally started at the finale's end.

<a href="Principal%20photography">Principal photography</a> took place in Vancouver, <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>. The crew used two cameras simultaneously for each scene, which allowed for two different angles to be filmed of the same sequence. The series usually has a dark atmosphere, though production purposefully created a contrasting appearance for certain episodes. "Hollywood Babylon" details the filming of a fake horror movie, and the use of two filming styles helped make a distinction; scenes of the <a href="Story%20within%20a%20story%23Film%20within%20a%20film">fake film</a> used more saturated colors, while scenes for the actual episode were "down to reality". To depict the perfect world of "What Is and What Should Never Be", the usual shadows and "moody lighting" more made colorful and warm.

Problems during production sometimes arose. For his scenes as the yellow-eyed demon <a href="Azazel%20%28Supernatural%29">Azazel</a> throughout the season, <a href="Fredric%20Lehne">Fredric Lehne</a> wore hard, colored contact lenses that greatly obscured his vision. The production crew placed sandbags on the floor to help him locate his marks. <a href="Lindsey%20McKeon">Lindsey McKeon</a>, who portrayed a Reaper briefly possessed by Azazel in "In My Time of Dying", also experienced the same problem. Her scene—she touches Ackles' forehead—took nine takes to film because she kept missing. Filming for "What Is and What Should Never Be" was interrupted in order to accommodate the busy <a href="Adrianne%20Palicki">Adrianne Palicki</a>. Production shifted to the following episode after five days of filming, and resumed when Palicki became available for the final three days.
Because the series uses few standing sets, set designer Jerry Wanek often had to construct entirely new sets for each episode. Outside elements had an influence on some designs, with the bar in the hotel of "Playthings" being an homage to "<a href="The%20Shining%20%28film%29">The Shining</a>". A Wisconsin native, Wanek was able to incorporate personal items into the motel set for the Wisconsin-based episode "Nightshifter"; because <a href="polka">polka</a> is part of the state's culture, he used posters from his father's old polka band, as well as photos of his nephews and Wisconsin landmarks. Due to "Tall Tales"'s atmosphere, that episode's motel was designed to be "over the top". Wanek noted, "They were in this really odd-looking motel that had crystal chandeliers and carved beds, turquoise stove and refrigerator, and this wonderful <a href="Periodization">period</a> linoleum on the floor. I thought it really matched the tempo and emotion of the show." At times, however, Wanek was able to reuse old sets. The loft set from "No Exit" was redesigned into an apartment for "Crossroad Blues", and the bar in "Born Under a Bad Sign" was a refurbished Roadhouse set.

Not all scenes could take place in the studio, and some were instead shot <a href="Filming%20location">on location</a>. The vault scenes in "Nightshifter" were filmed in an actual bank safe, as production would not have been able to construct one on set. Outside shots were filmed in downtown Vancouver, forcing streets to be closed off. The crypt of "Houses of the Holy" was built underneath St. Andrew's-Wesley United Church, with plastic used to imitate sculpted stone. <a href="Riverview%20Hospital%20%28Coquitlam%29">Riverview Hospital</a>—used as a filming location in previous episodes—was used for the premiere "In My Time of Dying". It also functioned as a jail in "Folsom Prison Blues" due to, as Wanek describes, "the texture on the walls, the lack of any humanity in the design, and the materials used to build it..." However, the prison block was built on a sound stage. The final scenes of "Simon Said" were filmed at <a href="Cleveland%20Dam">Cleveland Dam</a>, and "<a href="All%20Hell%20Breaks%20Loose%20%28Supernatural%29">All Hell Breaks Loose, Part One</a>" made use of a pre-existing set built for the Western television series "<a href="Bordertown%20%281989%20TV%20series%29">Bordertown</a>". The climax of "Part Two" was originally to take place in an actual cemetery, but numerous issues forced production to film the scene in the studio.

The mostly synthesized orchestral score of the season was composed by <a href="Christopher%20Lennertz">Christopher Lennertz</a> and <a href="Jay%20Gruska">Jay Gruska</a>. The pair try to base the music on the visuals of each episode, with about a third of each episode's score being newly written for the supernatural legend. For example, when the werewolf's point of view is depicted in "Heart", Gruska tried to make the score predatorial. For "Roadkill"'s emotional ending, Lennertz used cello and piano to "[tug] at the heart strings" and "push the tears". The music was supposed to "become part of the sinister wallpaper" in "In My Time of Dying". Thus, in the scene involving John Winchester selling his soul to Azazel, Gruska wrote the music as "dark and dank", but feels the viewer would only notice the music if it was removed from the scene.

Other musical elements were based on aspects of the episode, and often used less conventional instruments. For "Simon Said"—featuring characters with the ability of mind-control—Gruska tried to make the score more "mind-trippy", opting to mainly use "synthy, spacey electronica pads" to give it a science-fiction sound. Toy-piano sounds were included in "Playthings" by Gruska to make the score more childlike. Because of the <a href="Robert%20Johnson">Robert Johnson</a> theme of "Crossroad Blues", Lennertz made sure to be specific to Johnson's style when writing the music for the opening scene. A <a href="blues">blues</a> guitarist was brought in, and played on a "beat-up old acoustic guitar". However, they added in dissonant notes to foreshadow the "grittiness to come". Lennertz used organ, drums, bass, and guitar to have a "retro bluesy approach" for "Folsom Prison Blues", mimicking the style of film composer <a href="David%20Holmes%20%28musician%29">David Holmes</a>. Likewise, he wanted the episode "Nightshifter" to have a "feature film feel", with the score ending up similar to "<a href="The%20Bourne%20Identity%20%282002%20film%29">The Bourne Identity</a>". With <a href="Linda%20Blair">Linda Blair</a> of "<a href="The%20Exorcist%20%28film%29">The Exorcist</a>" guest starring in "The Usual Suspects", Gruska used <a href="tubular%20bells">tubular bells</a> as an homage to the film's score.

In addition to the score, the series makes use of rock songs, with most being selected from Kripke's private collection. Among the many bands featured in the second season are <a href="AC/DC">AC/DC</a>, <a href="Lynyrd%20Skynyrd">Lynyrd Skynyrd</a>, and <a href="Boston%20%28band%29">Boston</a>. Rock songs are also usually featured in "The Road So Far" montages at the beginning of select episodes that recap previous events. The premiere used <a href="Ted%20Nugent">Ted Nugent</a>'s "<a href="Stranglehold%20%28Ted%20Nugent%20song%29">Stranglehold</a>", and a "coming soon" sequence midway through the season was set to <a href="Nazareth%20%28band%29">Nazareth</a>'s "<a href="Hair%20of%20the%20Dog%20%28song%29">Hair of the Dog</a>". The finale recapped the entire season to <a href="Kansas%20%28band%29">Kansas</a>' "<a href="Carry%20On%20Wayward%20Son">Carry On Wayward Son</a>". The second season also began the tradition of naming many episodes after classic rock songs, with Kripke preferring <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> songs.

The series makes use of visual, special, and make-up effects, as well as stuntwork. Beginning with the second season, visual effects became an in-house department. Visual effects supervisor Ivan Hayden feels this improved the series because a fixed budget allowed them to compensate for other scenes that lacked effects, such as in "Nightshifter". Wide shots of the bank's exterior—featuring closed-off streets, police, and SWAT helicopters—were accomplished with visual effects. The series' catchphrase—"Scary just got sexy"—was added to a billboard in the background. For the episode "Houses of the Holy", production did not want viewers to be able to determine that the "angel" was in actuality a priest. Thus, the shape engulfed in light was a girl wearing a skintight white leotard. At times, the visual effects used were subtle. Cockroaches were digitally inserted into the sewer scenes of "No Exit"; director Kim Manners did not ask for it, but thought the addition "made it really creepy". The episode "Playthings" featured a scene of a man dying after falling down stairs. The department added blood flowing from underneath him, and also made his fingers twitch and his mouth open and close to create a more lifelike appearance.

The special effects and makeup departments are also important assets to production. Dean has an out-of-body experience in "In My Time of Dying", and some scenes feature him looking at his own body in a hospital bed. To forgo the use of visual effects, the special effects department sculpted a full gelatin face from Ackles, and applied it to a body double. To depict a woman burning to death in the episode "Simon Said", the actress was sealed inside a full body silicone designed to look like her, and was doused with fire accelerant. She was required to breathe through a straw, as well as don underwear soaked in ice-cold fire-retardant gel. Prior to "Heart", Kripke had not wanted to include werewolves in the series, as he felt that the budget would only allow for "a guy with fur glued to his face". As he prefers to have monsters be able to walk among humans, production made the transformation subtle—the character's eyes change, and her canine teeth and fingernails grow. However, writer Sera Gamble believes that they "dropped the ball" in the design, feeling that the creature looked too similar to a vampire.

"Supernatural" had low ratings during its second season. Viewers consisted mainly of teenage girls, with the CW trying to attract more males. It ranked No. 216 <a href="Ranking">relative to the position</a> of other <a href="prime%20time">prime time</a> <a href="Television%20network%23United%20States">network shows</a>. With an average viewership of 3.14 million Americans, the show's future was in doubt at the season's end. Despite this, the series was renewed for a third season. According to Special Forces Soldier Master Sergeant Kevin Wise at a 2007 "Supernatural" convention, the DVDs most requested by armed forces personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan were the first two seasons of the series.

The second season of the series received positive reviews from critics. The <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregator</a> website <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> reported a 100% approval rating with an average rating of 8.2/10 based on 5 reviews. Jim Kaz of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> gave the season a similar score at 8/10. While at first hesitant of the series, believing it to be "another horror/sci-fi/occult hybrid currently igniting ratings", he found the "eerie and intricate storylines" to overcome the "initial impressions of <a href="Clearasil">Clearasil</a> ads and <a href="Paris%20Hilton">Paris Hilton</a> in "<a href="House%20of%20Wax%20%282005%20film%29">House of Wax</a>"". Praising the <a href="cliffhanger">cliffhanger</a>s and the brotherly chemistry between the lead actors, Kaz deemed "Supernatural" "one-helluva edge-of-your-seat, ball-burner of a series with a forceful script, excellent acting (said pretty boys included) and some fine special effects". Maureen Ryan of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" thoroughly enjoyed the season, and "really, really liked" the Roadhouse. Not understanding why the Roadhouse was not used more throughout the season, she was "pretty annoyed" when it was destroyed. Ryan also favored the new hunter characters, especially Ash, and was "not thrilled" when Ash was killed. Regarding Sam and Dean, she noted the series' "ability the brotherly conflicts and emotions threaded through a well-plotted monster-of-the-week story". While she enjoyed <a href="Tricia%20Helfer">Tricia Helfer</a>'s guest appearance, she did not enjoy the stunt casting of <a href="Linda%20Blair">Linda Blair</a> and would have preferred a "more skilled actress". The season received a grade of a B- from Brian Tallerico of <a href="UGO%20Networks">UGO</a>, who found it "frustrating" due to the use of the "same predictable formula" that did not meet the standards of the first season. Other problems he found included "the brothers [turning] whiny and mopey and [taking] everything too seriously". However, he believed that the season ended "strong"—he liked how the main storyline was wrapped up, opening new storylines—and noted that there were some "excellent" episodes. Tallerico praised the "tongue-in-cheek Winchester adventure" "The Usual Suspects", feeling that it had "enough pop culture references to make <a href="Quentin%20Tarantino">Tarantino</a> jealous" and the "pitch-perfect mix of tones that make the show so great". He also found "Nightshifter" to be the "best action hour of "Supernatural"s second year", deeming it "riveting from beginning to end". Also applauding the season's cliffhanger was Peter Brown of iFMagazine, who gave the season a B+. He enjoyed the expansion of the series' mythology, as well as the new characters introduced. He also praised the "haunting music and sounds that really give a chilling feel to each and every episode", feeling them to be <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy</a>-worthy.

The season's cast and crew received the attention of multiple award programs. Writer Raelle Tucker won the Constellation Award for "Best Overall 2007 Science Fiction Film or Television Script" for the episode "What Is and What Should Never Be", and work on "All Hell Breaks Loose, Part Two" garnered a <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Sound%20Editors">Golden Reel</a> nomination for "Best Sound Editing in Television: Short Form – Sound Effects and Foley". <a href="Conchita%20Campbell">Conchita Campbell</a> gained a <a href="Young%20Artist%20Award">Young Artist Award</a> nomination for "Best Performance in a TV Series – Guest Starring Young Actress" for her performance in "Playthings", and <a href="Jessica%20Harmon">Jessica Harmon</a> was nominated in 2008 for a <a href="Leo%20Awards">Leo Award</a> in the category of "Best Guest Performance by a Female in a Dramatic Series" for the episode "All Hell Breaks Loose, Part One".

The second season of "Supernatural" was released as a six-disc Region 1 DVD box set in the US on September 11, 2007, two weeks before the premiere of the third season. Including all 22 episodes of the second season, the set also featured DVD extras such as episode commentaries, deleted scenes, bloopers, Jared Padalecki's original screen test, and a featurette on the making of the season finale. The season was ranked No. 13 in DVD sales for its week of release, selling 67,735 sets for $2,573,253. However, it slipped out of the top-30 list the following week. For Region 2, the season was divided into two parts, being released on May 14, 2007, and September 10, 2007; the complete set was released on October 29, 2007. The season was also released in Region 4 on October 3, 2007. The second season was released on Region A <a href="Blu-ray%20Disc">Blu-ray Disc</a> on June 14, 2011, including a new special feature–"The Devil's Road Map", an interactive guide featuring interviews about every episode.

The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati

"The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati" is the second episode of the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%207%29">seventh season</a> of the American science fiction television series "<a href="The%20X-Files">The X-Files</a>". It was directed by <a href="Michael%20W.%20Watkins">Michael Watkins</a> and written by lead actor <a href="David%20Duchovny">David Duchovny</a> and series creator <a href="Chris%20Carter%20%28screenwriter%29">Chris Carter</a>. The installment explores the series' overarching <a href="Mythology%20of%20The%20X-Files">mythology</a> and concludes a trilogy of episodes revolving around <a href="Fox%20Mulder">Fox Mulder</a>'s (Duchovny) severe reaction to an alien artifact. Originally aired by the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> network on November 14, 1999, "The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati" received a <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen rating</a> of 10.1 and was seen by 16.15 million viewers. Initial reviews were mixed, and the plot and dialogue attracted criticism. Later critics viewed the episode in a more positive light, and several writers named it among the best in the series.

"The X-Files" centers on <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) special agents Mulder and <a href="Dana%20Scully">Dana Scully</a> (<a href="Gillian%20Anderson">Gillian Anderson</a>), who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called <a href="X-File">X-File</a>s. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, and the skeptical Scully was initially assigned to debunk his work, but the two have developed a deep friendship. In this episode, Scully returns from Africa to discover Mulder in a coma induced by exposure to shards from an alien spaceship wreck. After Mulder disappears from the hospital, Scully joins former government employee <a href="List%20of%20The%20X-Files%20characters%23Michael%20Kritschgau">Michael Kritschgau</a> (<a href="John%20Finn">John Finn</a>) and her boss <a href="Walter%20Skinner">Walter Skinner</a> (<a href="Mitch%20Pileggi">Mitch Pileggi</a>) to search for him. Meanwhile, in a dream, <a href="The%20Smoking%20Man">The Smoking Man</a> (<a href="William%20B.%20Davis">William B. Davis</a>) offers Mulder a new life and a fresh start. After conferring with a vision of Scully, Mulder awakens from his coma and realizes his duty to prevent alien colonization.

Carter was interested in the possibility that <a href="ancient%20astronauts">extraterrestrials were involved</a> in ancient <a href="extinction%20event">mass extinctions</a> on Earth and used these themes in the episode. Much of the episode was also inspired by <a href="Nikos%20Kazantzakis">Nikos Kazantzakis</a>'s novel "<a href="The%20Last%20Temptation%20of%20Christ">The Last Temptation of Christ</a>", and a scene showing an operation on Mulder has been thematically compared to the <a href="Crucifixion%20of%20Jesus">Crucifixion of Jesus</a>. For the dream sequences, casting director Rick Millikan brought back many actors and actresses who had been absent from the show for several years, including <a href="Jerry%20Hardin">Jerry Hardin</a> as <a href="Deep%20Throat%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Deep Throat</a>, <a href="Rebecca%20Toolan">Rebecca Toolan</a> as <a href="List%20of%20minor%20The%20X-Files%20characters%23Teena%20Mulder">Teena Mulder</a>, and <a href="Megan%20Leitch">Megan Leitch</a> as <a href="Samantha%20Mulder">Samantha Mulder</a>.

In the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%206%29">sixth-season</a> finale "<a href="Biogenesis%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Biogenesis</a>", FBI agents <a href="Fox%20Mulder">Fox Mulder</a> (<a href="David%20Duchovny">David Duchovny</a>) and <a href="Dana%20Scully">Dana Scully</a> (<a href="Gillian%20Anderson">Gillian Anderson</a>) investigate a rock inscribed with <a href="Navajo%20language">Navajo writing</a> found in <a href="Ivory%20Coast">Côte d'Ivoire</a>. While examining it in Washington, D.C., Mulder hears ringing sounds and suffers several headaches. He turns to Agent <a href="List%20of%20The%20X-Files%20characters%23Diana%20Fowley">Diana Fowley</a> (<a href="Mimi%20Rogers">Mimi Rogers</a>), his former love interest, for help before his mental health rapidly deteriorates and he is transferred to a psychiatric hospital. Meanwhile, Scully heads to New Mexico to ask a dying <a href="List%20of%20minor%20The%20X-Files%20characters%23Albert%20Hosteen">Albert Hosteen</a> (<a href="Floyd%20Westerman">Floyd Red Crow Westerman</a>) to translate what is on the rock: he discovers that the item includes passages from the Bible, and a map of the <a href="human%20genome">human genome</a>.

In the seventh season premiere "<a href="The%20Sixth%20Extinction%20%28The%20X-Files%29">The Sixth Extinction</a>", Scully journeys to Côte d'Ivoire and discovers an alien spaceship wreck. After Scully examines the shards, she begins to believe that they hold the key to all of life's mysteries. Meanwhile, Mulder slips into a coma, and Assistant Director <a href="Walter%20Skinner">Walter Skinner</a> (<a href="Mitch%20Pileggi">Mitch Pileggi</a>) enlists the help of former <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">Department of Defense</a> agent <a href="List%20of%20minor%20The%20X-Files%20characters%23Michael%20Kritschgau">Michael Kritschgau</a> (<a href="John%20Finn">John Finn</a>) to determine what is wrong with Mulder. The two discover that while Mulder's condition has made him unresponsive, it has given him <a href="telepathy">telepathic</a> powers. Scully, working in Africa, witnesses several strange events relating to the wreck before returning to Washington.

<a href="Teena%20Mulder%23Teena%20Mulder">Teena Mulder</a> (<a href="Rebecca%20Toolan">Rebecca Toolan</a>) and <a href="The%20Smoking%20Man">The Smoking Man</a> (<a href="William%20B.%20Davis">William B. Davis</a>) visit Mulder, who is paralyzed in a hospital. After administering a drug that cures his paralysis, The Smoking Man reveals himself to be Mulder's father and takes him from the hospital. Meanwhile, Kritschgau visits Scully and claims that Mulder's contact with the shard of an alien spaceship has reawakened the extraterrestrial <a href="Colonist%20%28The%20X-Files%29%23Black%20oil">black oil</a> with which he was infected <a href="Tunguska%20%28The%20X-Files%29">three years previously</a>; because he is infected with the virus, Mulder is proof of alien life. Skinner, who has been looking for Mulder, tells Scully that Mulder's mother signed him out of the hospital. The Smoking Man takes Mulder to an unfamiliar neighborhood; inside a new home, he finds his former informant <a href="Deep%20Throat%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Deep Throat</a> (<a href="Jerry%20Hardin">Jerry Hardin</a>). Deep Throat claims to have faked his own death to escape the burden he was under by being a part of the <a href="Syndicate%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Syndicate</a>, and he suggests that Mulder can now do the same. Mulder meets Fowley, and the two have sex.

On the hospital security tapes, Scully sees Mulder's mother talking to The Smoking Man but is unable to contact her. Scully receives a package containing a book on <a href="Native%20American%20religion">Native American beliefs</a>, which describes how one man will prevent the impending apocalypse. Again visiting Kritschgau, she notices he has a stolen copy of her information on the alien spaceship. After he admits hacking her computer, she deletes the files from his laptop.

Mulder is reunited with his sister <a href="Samantha%20Mulder">Samantha</a> (<a href="Megan%20Leitch">Megan Leitch</a>) in his new life. He marries Fowley and they have children. The years pass quickly; he grows older and Fowley dies. Mulder is revealed to be dreaming everything: in reality he is in a government facility being tended to by doctors while The Smoking Man and Fowley watch. The Smoking Man is preparing to have portions of Mulder's cranial tissue—which have been infected and activated because of the alien virus—implanted into himself. During the operation, The Smoking Man admits that he believes that Mulder has become an <a href="Alien%20abduction">alien-human hybrid</a>, and that by taking Mulder's genetic material he alone will survive the coming alien onslaught.

Mulder becomes an old man in his dream, accompanied by an unaging Smoking Man who tells him that Fowley, Deep Throat, Samantha and Scully have all died. The Smoking Man looks out the window, revealing an alien holocaust. Back in reality, <a href="Alex%20Krycek">Alex Krycek</a> (<a href="Nicholas%20Lea">Nicholas Lea</a>) kills Kritschgau, burns his papers, and steals his laptop. Scully, having earlier been visited by the spirit of Albert Hosteen who convinces her to pray, awakens in her apartment to discover that someone has slipped a security card under her door. Using it, she enters the facility where Mulder is being held. In Mulder's dream, Scully meets him at his bedside and convinces him to break with his imaginary life. In reality, Scully finds Mulder and the two escape the facility. A week later Scully meets Mulder at his apartment and tells him that Fowley was found murdered. Mulder confides that, during his ordeal, Scully served as his "<a href="Touchstone%20%28metaphor%29">touchstone</a>".

"The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati" was written by Duchovny and "The X-Files" creator <a href="Chris%20Carter%20%28screenwriter%29">Chris Carter</a>, making it Duchovny's second on-screen writing credit, after the sixth-season episode "<a href="The%20Unnatural%20%28The%20X-Files%29">The Unnatural</a>". He had previously co-developed the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%202%29">second-season</a> finale "<a href="Anasazi%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Anasazi</a>" with Carter, and had received a teleplay credit for the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%203%29">third-season</a> episodes "<a href="Avatar%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Avatar</a>" and "<a href="Talitha%20Cumi%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Talitha Cumi</a>". Duchovny worked on his portion of the script while Carter wrote the season premiere, "The Sixth Extinction". Carter then added his remaining portions to Duchovny's script after finishing his work on the previous episode. The tagline that appears in the opening credits for this episode is "<a href="amor%20fati">amor fati</a>". This is a Latin phrase referring to the "love of fate", which is an important concept in the philosophical works of <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>. In the context of the episode, the subtitle has been interpreted by writer <a href="Charlton%20McIlwain">Charlton McIlwain</a> in his book "When Death Goes Pop: Death, Media & the Remaking of Community" as a reference to the love of a predestined life, in this case, Mulder's dream. In her book "We Want to Believe", Amy Donaldson suggests the phrase means that Mulder must "love his suffering and passively accept it [and] actively embrace his journey ... and release his spirit to find new vigor."

Mulder's dream and decisions in "The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati" are reminiscent of Jesus's actions in <a href="Nikos%20Kazantzakis">Nikos Kazantzakis</a>'s novel "<a href="The%20Last%20Temptation%20of%20Christ">The Last Temptation of Christ</a>". Duchovny, a fan of the book, found parallels between its central story and Mulder's ordeal and incorporated many of the novel's concepts into the episode. In "The Last Temptation of Christ", Jesus is torn between his higher calling as the son of God and his desire towards his own humanity. Duchovny was drawn to the fact that Christ's struggle in the novel was "not only godlike, but also profoundly human" and used this template for Mulder; in the series, Mulder is destined towards greater things—in this case, stopping the oncoming alien invasion—but he also desires to have a normal, human life. Duchovny noted: "Mulder is a guy who's been given the same problem [as Jesus]. What I'm doing is using the very human model of Christ". Duchovny cautioned that he was not trying to make Mulder into a Christ-like savior figure but rather "an everyman". Executive producer <a href="Frank%20Spotnitz">Frank Spotnitz</a> described the concept as a risk, but Duchovny felt that this exploration of Mulder's character was necessary.

Several of the lines in the episode proved difficult for both fans and cast members to embrace. Fans did not readily accept that The Smoking Man was Mulder's father. Davis, who portrayed The Smoking Man, noted that fans did not believe the revelation because "part of the mystique of it was that everybody had their own idea of what was going on." The dialogue in the episode proved difficult for Anderson to present believably. She was troubled that her character was arguing against the existence of extraterrestrials, when in the previous episode her character had encountered an alien shipwreck. When she talked to Carter, she said that she did not "know if [she could] do this anymore" because her character was arguing against information that had been confirmed in the first two parts of the episode. Carter explained that there must be conflict between Mulder and Scully for the show's "believer versus skeptic" dynamic to work properly.

The portions of the episode about the alien shard and Mulder's telepathic abilities allude to the <a href="ancient%20astronaut">ancient astronaut</a> theory, which proposes that intelligent <a href="extraterrestrial%20life">extraterrestrial beings</a> visited Earth and made contact with humans in <a href="ancient%20history">antiquity</a> or <a href="prehistory">prehistory</a>. Spotnitz was surprised that the show received few complaints, even though the "Biogenesis"/"The Sixth Extinction"/"Amor Fati" story arc heavily suggested that aliens developed the notions of God and religion. He praised the manner in which the show handled this subject, saying, "Often in the past, we've done stuff where I was sure we would get angry letters. But we rarely do. And the reason is because of the way we handle things. In 'Amor Fati' we treated the religious side [of the story] with respect." Spotnitz later identified the combination of science and religion as "a conjunction of science and mysticism, of aliens and religion, that we're starting to develop. It's deliberate on our part, to help bring all the mythologies together into one story line." The ancient astronaut themes were revisited in two <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%209%29">season nine</a> episodes: "<a href="Provenance%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Provenance</a>" and "<a href="Providence%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Providence</a>".

"The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati" features a number of actors and actresses who had not appeared on the show for two or three years, including Hardin as Deep Throat, Rebecca Toolan as <a href="List%20of%20The%20X-Files%20characters%23Teena%20Mulder">Teena Mulder</a>, and Megan Leitch as Samantha Mulder. Hardin had last appeared in the fourth-season episode "<a href="Musings%20of%20a%20Cigarette%20Smoking%20Man">Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man</a>" during a flashback sequence, and Toolan's most recent role was in the second installment of the sixth-season episode "<a href="Dreamland%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Dreamland</a>". Likewise, Leitch—who portrayed Samantha as an adult—had acted in the second part of the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%205%29">fifth-season</a> opener "<a href="Redux%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Redux</a>". Milikan and the producers encountered difficulties when casting the boy whom Mulder meets on the beach in his dream. Originally, they cast the child of series producer <a href="Paul%20Rabwin">Paul Rabwin</a>'s neighbor, but <a href="Child%20actor%23Regulation%20of%20child%20actors">child labor</a> laws dictated a limit on his daily working hours, so twin boys were cast to allow the scenes to be shot in a single day.

"The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati" is the series' last episode to feature Mimi Rogers as Agent Fowley. After reading a copy of the script, Rogers realized that her character was going to die before she reached the ending. The script included a large part for Fowley, which Rogers described as "by far the most [she] had to do in an episode." She later explained, "It occurred to me [while I was reading the script], uh oh, this is way too good. I have too much to do. They're going to kill me."

Davis was pleased with the episode, and he stated: "For me the episode was terrific to play because they ended up making the Cigarette Smoking Man somewhat tougher. We have seen so much softness in him; it was great to play that tough side." With that said, he described the scene in which he was strapped to an operating table with Mulder as "totally uncomfortable", later joking that "the only upside of that was that the author [Duchovny] was lying right beside me, feeling equally uncomfortable. I wonder if David would have written it that way if he had known what he would have to go through."

The majority of the episode—like the rest of seasons six, seven, eight and nine—was filmed in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="California">California</a>. The housing community in Mulder's dream was filmed in an "affluent section" between <a href="Malibu%2C%20California">Malibu</a> and <a href="Pacific%20Palisades%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Pacific Palisades</a>. The scene in which The Smoking Man opens a window, revealing an apocalyptic alien landscape, used a special set and a <a href="matte%20painting">matte painting</a> background. Various special effects, such as explosions, were filmed separately, and the pieces were digitally composited to create the final scene. A scene in which Mulder watched himself age was also filmed, but was cut for unknown reasons.

The episode portrays Mulder as a Christ-like figure. As scientists experiment on him, he is placed on a cross-like table, which has been interpreted to be symbolic of the <a href="Crucifixion%20of%20Jesus">cross</a> to which Jesus was nailed. Mulder wears a metal ring around his head, similar to the biblical <a href="crown%20of%20thorns">crown of thorns</a>. Donaldson notes that The Smoking Man's advice to Mulder to save himself echoes what bystanders told Jesus as he hung from the cross. She draws parallels between Mulder's status as the "savior" of the human race—because of his immunity from the alien infection—and Jesus, whom Christians venerate as humanity's savior.

Donaldson, in her essay "The Last Temptation of Mulder", writes that in Kazantzakis' novel Jesus "represents what is the utmost human challenge, that of releasing the divinity within from its earthly confines." In this way, the Jesus of "The Last Temptation of Christ" represents "utter humanity" and the "struggle between the spirit and the flesh". Mulder is similarly challenged when he is enticed by The Smoking Man, and overcomes temptation by giving up his dream life and embracing his destiny to stop the alien invasion. Several characters in the episode resemble those in the novel. For instance, Fowley is similar to Kazantzakis's version of <a href="Mary%20Magdalene">Mary Magdalene</a>—both characters "thwart the mission" of the hero. Scully parallels Kazantzakis' version of <a href="Judas%20Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a>, as they both call the heroes out of their respective trances.

According to McIlwain, the episode represents the series' ultimate "coalescence of science, religion, and metaphysics". It is one of the few episodes in which Scully sets aside her empirical reasoning to save Mulder's life. Scully, representing the more rational one "who must anchor herself in the certainty of scientific facts", discovers the alien shards and deduces that they hold the key to "every question that has ever been asked". Mulder, on the other hand, represents the one who "seeks the truth among a realm of possibilities too fantastic and beyond the realm of scientific validity" and possesses the needed tool—his immunity—to solve the puzzle. The episode also explores the moral side of The Smoking Man and his affinity for evil. Kenneth Silber of <a href="Space.com">Space.com</a> notes that The Smoking Man's "enticing blandishments confirm he is a highly dangerous foe, one whose <a href="Machiavellianism">Machiavellian</a> creativity borders on the <a href="Satanism">Satanic</a>." Timothy Dunn and Joseph J. Foy note in "Moral Musings on a Cigarette Smoking Man" that The Smoking Man's evil deeds have little to do with his mission in the Syndicate, instead reflecting his desire for "completely gratuitous" evil. The two cite his line "Aren't you expecting me to sprout vampire fangs?" as evidence that The Smoking Man is aware of his crimes but casually shrugs them off.

"The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati" originally aired in the United States on the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> network on November 14, 1999, and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on <a href="Sky1">Sky1</a> on March 26, 2000. In the U.S., the episode was watched by 16.15 million viewers and ranked as the 27th-most watched episode of any series on network TV for the week ending November 14. It earned a <a href="Nielsen%20rating">Nielsen household rating</a> of 10.1, with a 14 share. Nielsen ratings are <a href="audience%20measurement">audience measurement</a> systems that determine the audience size and composition of television programming in the U.S. This means that roughly 10.1 percent of all television-equipped households, and 14 percent of households watching television, were watching the episode. In the U.K., "The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati" was seen by 840,000 viewers, making it the channel's third-most watched program for that week after episodes of "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>" and "<a href="Friends">Friends</a>". On May 13, 2003, the episode was released on DVD as part of the complete seventh season. Two years later, the episode was included on "<a href="The%20X-Files%20Mythology%2C%20Volume%203%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20Colonization">The X-Files Mythology, Volume 3 – Colonization</a>", a DVD collection that contains episodes involving the alien colonists.

Initial reviews of the episode were mixed. After the episode aired, Silber was disappointed in its resolution, writing, "This episode adeptly combines surrealism and a sense of impending climax—only to sputter out in disappointment when nothing much gets resolved at the end." He dismissed "Mulder's one-week recovery from his horrifying ordeal" as "facile and unconvincing". He did write that Mulder's dream provided "credible insight into the recesses of his troubled personality". "The X-Files" researcher and independent reviewer <a href="SFScope">Sarah Stegall</a> awarded the episode a three out of five score after the episode aired. She argued that, in the episode, Mulder "is not a martyr but a victim" which makes him "pitiable, not heroic". Tom Kessenich, in his 2002 book "Examinations: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files", gave the episode a positive review, noting that the "Duchovny-penned final scene is exquisite in showcasing the beauty and power of Mulder and Scully's evolving relationship." He deemed Mulder's dream sequences "inspired television" and felt that the episode left itself open to interpretation. In the October 2000 issue of "<a href="Cinefantastique">Cinefantastique</a>", writer Paula Vitaris gave the episode a mixed review, awarding it two stars out of four. She criticized the recycling of the "one partner lies comatose while the other runs around trying to find a cure" storyline, but she was more positive towards Mulder's reverie, calling it visually "beautiful".

Later reviews of the episode tended to see the installment in a more positive light. <a href="Robert%20Shearman">Robert Shearman</a> and <a href="Lars%20Pearson">Lars Pearson</a>, in their 2009 book "Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen", rated the episode four stars out of five. They stated that the installment "kicks off the seventh season with great style", becoming a "rallying cry for the last leg of the race". The two enjoyed its "real passion", which they felt mythology-heavy episodes usually lacked. In 2012, Todd VanDerWerff of "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" rated the episode a "B", but criticized the writing, calling it "very <a href="purple%20prose">purple prose</a>" and Carter's most "overwrought script since the glory days of '<a href="The%20Blessing%20Way%20%28The%20X-Files%29">The Blessing Way</a>'." He was also critical of the "absolutely atrocious" make-up used to transform Duchovny into an old man. Notwithstanding his negativity towards the writing, plot, and make-up, VanDerWerff said that he truly "enjoy[ed] both halves of 'The Sixth Extinction' all the same" despite calling it "entertainingly bad [and] ludicrously over-the-top". He complimented the scene in which The Smoking Man looked out onto the alien apocalypse, deeming it a "pretty impressive TV effects accomplishment".

Since its original airing, critics have listed "The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati" among the best "X-Files" episodes. Kessenich named the entry thirteenth in his list of the top 25 "The X-Files" episodes. Den of Geek writer Nina Sordi named the installment—as a trilogy with "Biogenesis" and "The Sixth Extinction"—the fifth-best episode of the series, writing that, "it is evident that as ["The X-Files"] progressed, the episodes surrounding those storylines and the breaking points Mulder and Scully endured push them further and further towards total, irreversible defeat. This is especially poignant when viewing this anxiety inducing trio of episodes." Matt Champlin of "<a href="The%20Post-Standard">The Post-Standard</a>" named the episode the ninth best of the series. Monica S. Kuebler of "<a href="Exclaim%21">Exclaim!</a>" called "The Sixth Extinction", along with "Biogenesis" and "Amor Fati", one of the best episodes of the show's "colonization" phase. Michael Liedtke and George Avalos, writing for the "<a href="East%20Bay%20Times">Contra Costa Times</a>", stated that the final scene with Mulder and Scully was one of the most "tender moments" in which they did not kiss. "Entertainment Weekly" named the same scene one of 25 "Great TV 'I Love You's'" , declaring that it "left [viewers] with goosebumps".

History of the National Hockey League (1942–1967)

The <a href="Original%20Six">Original Six</a> era of the National Hockey League (NHL) began in 1942 with the demise of the <a href="New%20York%20Americans">Brooklyn Americans</a>, reducing the league to six teams: <a href="Boston%20Bruins">Boston Bruins</a>, <a href="Chicago%20Blackhawks">Chicago Black Hawks</a>, <a href="Detroit%20Red%20Wings">Detroit Red Wings</a>, <a href="Montreal%20Canadiens">Montreal Canadiens</a>, <a href="New%20York%20Rangers">New York Rangers</a>, and <a href="Toronto%20Maple%20Leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a>. This structure remained stable for a quarter century; the era ended in 1967 when the NHL doubled in size adding six <a href="1967%20NHL%20Expansion">expansion teams</a>.

The <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a>, was the "de facto" championship since 1926, becoming the "de jure" championship in 1947, when the NHL completed a deal with the Stanley Cup trustees to gain control of the Cup. Toronto and Montreal evidenced dynasties, as the Maple Leafs won the Stanley Cup nine times from 1942 onwards, while the Canadiens won ten times, including five consecutive titles between 1956 and 1960. The 1967 championship is the last Maple Leafs title to date.

Remarkably, <a href="Maurice%20Richard">Maurice Richard</a> became the first player to score 50 goals in a season in <a href="1944%E2%80%9345%20NHL%20season">1944–45</a>. In 1955, Richard was suspended for assaulting a linesman, leading to the <a href="Richard%20Riot">Richard Riot</a>. <a href="Gordie%20Howe">Gordie Howe</a> made his debut in 1946, retiring 32 years later as the NHL's all-time leader in both goals and points. <a href="Willie%20O%27Ree">Willie O'Ree</a> broke the NHL's <a href="color%20barrier">colour barrier</a> when he dressed for the Bruins in 1958.

The NHL continued to develop throughout the era. In 1943, in an attempt to 'open up' the game, the league introduced the <a href="Hockey%20rink">centre-ice red line</a> allowing players for the first time to pass out of their defensive zone. In 1959, <a href="Jacques%20Plante">Jacques Plante</a> became the first goaltender to regularly wear a face mask for protection. Off the ice, the business of hockey was changing as well. The first <a href="NHL%20Entry%20Draft">amateur draft</a> was held in 1963 as part of efforts to balance talent distribution within the league. The <a href="National%20Hockey%20League%20Players%20Association">National Hockey League Players Association</a> was formed in 1967, ten years after <a href="Ted%20Lindsay">Ted Lindsay</a>'s attempts at unionization failed.
In the 1930s and early 1940s, both the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> and <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> were detrimental to the NHL. Although the league peaked at ten teams between 1926 and 1931, financial pressures led to the demise of several of these. In 1930, the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates%20%28NHL%29">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> relocated to become the <a href="Philadelphia%20Quakers%20%28NHL%29">Philadelphia Quakers</a> before folding in 1931. In 1934, the <a href="Ottawa%20Senators%20%28original%29">Ottawa Senators</a> became the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Eagles">St. Louis Eagles</a>, and likewise ceased operations after one year in their new market. The <a href="Montreal%20Maroons">Montreal Maroons</a> suspended operations in 1937 as the Montreal market was unable to support two teams. The New York Americans, renamed the <a href="New%20York%20Americans">Brooklyn Americans</a>, suspended operations in 1942, citing financial difficulty, and a lack of players due to the war. By the <a href="1942%E2%80%9343%20NHL%20season">1942–43 season</a>, the league was reduced to six teams. Those six teams are now known, somewhat misleadingly, as the "<a href="Original%20Six">Original Six</a>." There was no more expansion or contraction until <a href="1967%20NHL%20expansion">1967</a>.

There was also change at the top; in February 1943, league President <a href="Frank%20Calder">Frank Calder</a> collapsed during a meeting, dying shortly after. After receiving assurances from the league the Brooklyn franchise he operated would resume play after the war, <a href="Red%20Dutton">Red Dutton</a> agreed to take over as president. When the other team owners reneged on this promise in 1946, Dutton resigned as league president. In 1946, with Dutton's recommendation, <a href="Clarence%20Campbell">Clarence Campbell</a> was named president of the NHL. Campbell remained until retirement in 1977. Campbell's tenure matched the league's stability. For the first 21 years of his presidency, the same six teams competed for the Stanley Cup; that period has been called the "golden age of hockey". The NHL featured increasingly intense rivalries coupled with rule innovations that opened up the game.

World War II extensively ravaged the rosters of many teams; by the <a href="1943%E2%80%9344%20NHL%20season">1943–44 season</a> teams battled each other for players. In need of a goaltender, the Bruins won a fight with the Canadiens over the services of <a href="Bert%20Gardiner">Bert Gardiner</a>. Meanwhile, the Rangers were forced to lend forward <a href="Phil%20Watson">Phil Watson</a> to the Canadiens in exchange for two players, as Watson was required in Montreal for a war job, and refused permission to play in New York.

With only five returning players from the previous season, Rangers general manager <a href="Lester%20Patrick">Lester Patrick</a> suggested suspension of his team's play for the duration of the war. Patrick was otherwise persuaded; however, the Rangers managed only six wins in a 50-game schedule, giving up 310 goals that year. The Rangers were so desperate for players that 42-year-old coach <a href="Frank%20Boucher">Frank Boucher</a> made a brief comeback, recording four goals and ten assists in 15 games. That year the Canadiens dominated the league, finishing with a 38–5–7 record. Five losses remains a league record for the fewest in one season; the Canadiens did not lose a game on home ice. Their 1944 <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a> victory was the team's first in 14 seasons. The Canadiens again dominated the <a href="1944%E2%80%9345%20NHL%20season">1944–45</a>, finishing with a 38–8–4 record. They were defeated in the playoffs by the underdog Maple Leafs, who eventually won the Cup.

NHL teams exclusively competed for the Stanley Cup following the 1926 demise of the <a href="Western%20Canada%20Hockey%20League">Western Hockey League</a>. Though rejected by Cup trustees for various reasons, in the intervening years other teams, and leagues, attempted to challenge for the Cup. In 1947, the NHL reached an agreement with trustees <a href="Philip%20Dansken%20Ross">P. D. Ross</a> and <a href="Cooper%20Smeaton">Cooper Smeaton</a> to grant Cup control to the NHL, thereby allowing the league to reject challenges from other leagues. The last such challenge came in 1953, from the <a href="Cleveland%20Barons%20%281937%E2%80%931973%29">Cleveland Barons</a> of the <a href="American%20Hockey%20League">American Hockey League</a>; it was rejected, as the AHL was not considered of equivalent calibre to the NHL, which was a condition of the NHL's 'deal' with trustees.

The <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a> was established in 1943 under the leadership of <a href="James%20T.%20Sutherland">James T. Sutherland</a>, a former President of the <a href="Canadian%20Amateur%20Hockey%20Association">Canadian Amateur Hockey Association</a> (CAHA). The Hall of Fame was established as a joint venture between the NHL and the CAHA, in <a href="Kingston%2C%20Ontario">Kingston, Ontario</a>, considered by Sutherland the birthplace of hockey. Originally called the "International Hockey Hall of Fame", its mandate was to honor great hockey players and to raise funds for a permanent location. The first eleven honored members were inducted on April 30, 1945. Not until 1961 did the Hockey Hall of Fame establish a permanent home at <a href="Exhibition%20Place">Exhibition Place</a> in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>.

On October 13, 1947, to raise money for the newly created NHL Pension Society, the first official <a href="National%20Hockey%20League%20All-Star%20Game">All-Star Game</a> took place at Toronto's <a href="Maple%20Leaf%20Gardens">Maple Leaf Gardens</a>. The NHL All-Stars defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs 4–3 and raised <a href="Canadian%20Dollar">C$</a>25,000 for the pension fund. The All-Star Game remains an annual tradition.

The 1940s Canadiens were led by the "<a href="Punch%20line%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Punch line</a>" of <a href="Elmer%20Lach">Elmer Lach</a>, <a href="Toe%20Blake">Toe Blake</a> and <a href="Maurice%20Richard">Maurice "Rocket" Richard</a>. In 1944–45, Lach, Richard and Blake finished first, second and third in the NHL's scoring race with 80, 73 and 67 points, respectively. Richard became a media and fan focus with attempts to score <a href="50%20goals%20in%2050%20games">50 goals in a 50-game season</a>, a feat no other player had accomplished in league history. During that season, in a 9–1 victory over Detroit on December 28, 1944, Richard set a single-game scoring record, scoring five goals and three assists. Later scoring his 45th goal in his 42nd game, he broke <a href="Joe%20Malone%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Joe Malone</a>'s goal scoring record. Opposing teams did all they could to prevent him from reaching the 50-goal mark: he was slashed, elbowed and held, as no team wanted to be known for giving up the 50th goal. Despite the opposition's efforts, in Boston at 17:45 of the third period of Montreal's final game of the season, Richard scored his 50th goal. Until <a href="Mike%20Bossy">Mike Bossy</a> in <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20NHL%20season">1980–81</a>, no other player scored 50 goals in 50 games.
In March 1955, Richard was suspended for the remainder of the season, including the playoffs, after receiving a match penalty for slashing Boston's <a href="Hal%20Laycoe">Hal Laycoe</a> then punching a linesman who attempted to intervene. The suspension created a wave of anger towards Campbell, who was warned not to attend a scheduled game in Montreal after receiving numerous death threats, mainly from French-Canadians accusing him of anti-French bias. Dismissing the warnings, Campbell attended the March 17 game, as planned. His presence was interpreted by many fans as provocation; he was booed, and pelted with eggs and fruit; an hour into the game, a fan lobbed a tear-gas bomb in Campbell's direction; firefighters decided to clear the building. A riot ensued outside the Forum as disenchanted fans leaving the Forum were met by a growing mob of angry demonstrators; the hostile crowd overwhelmed 250 police officers on the scene. Seventy people were arrested, another 37 people were injured; fifty stores were looted, and $100,000 in property damage was reported, in what became known as "l'affaire Richard", or the <a href="Richard%20Riot">Richard Riot</a>.

The following day, Richard went on Montreal radio to ask fans to cease rioting, and instead support the Canadiens in the playoffs; he offered to take his punishment then come back the following year to win the Cup. While the Canadiens were eliminated in the <a href="1955%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">1955 Stanley Cup Finals</a>, Richard led Montreal to the 1956 Stanley Cup. The incident highlighted the growing cultural gap between French Quebec and English Canada; the riot is often characterized as an early manifestation of Quebec's <a href="Quiet%20Revolution">Quiet Revolution</a>. Campbell's decision to suspend Richard was widely supported by fans outside of Quebec. Some, including Detroit's <a href="Ted%20Lindsay">Ted Lindsay</a>, said the suspension did not go far enough and argued Richard, a man who had paid more fines than any other player in league history, should have been banned for life.

On October 19, 1957, Richard became the first player to score 500 career goals. He retired in 1960, as an eight-time Stanley Cup champion, as well as the NHL's all-time leading scorer, with 544 goals. In 1961, the league waived the customary three-year waiting period; Richard was elected to the <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a>.

In the fall of 1951, in an attempt to determine whether it was a suitable medium for broadcasting hockey games, <a href="Conn%20Smythe">Conn Smythe</a> watched special <a href="television">television</a> feeds of Maple Leaf games. Television already had detractors within the NHL, especially Campbell who declared it "the greatest menace of the entertainment world". In 1952, even though only 10% of Canadians owned a television set, the <a href="Canadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">Canadian Broadcasting Corporation</a> (CBC) began televising games. On November 1, 1952, "<a href="Hockey%20Night%20in%20Canada">Hockey Night in Canada</a>" was first broadcast on television, with <a href="Foster%20Hewitt">Foster Hewitt</a> calling the action between the Leafs and Bruins at <a href="Maple%20Leaf%20Gardens">Maple Leaf Gardens</a>. The broadcasts quickly became the highest-rated show on Canadian television. The broadcast came three weeks after Montreal radio host <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Lecavalier">René Lecavalier</a> presented a French-language telecast of the Montreal Canadiens' opener against Chicago, marking the beginning of "<a href="La%20Soir%C3%A9e%20du%20hockey">La Soirée du hockey</a>", which Radio-Canada, the French arm of the CBC, broadcast until 2004. On that same night, <a href="Danny%20Gallivan">Danny Gallivan</a> made his debut as the English language play-by-play announcer for the Canadiens.

While Campbell feared televised hockey would cause people to stop attending games in person, Smythe felt the opposite. "There'll be thousands of people seeing hockey as played by the pros for the first time. They'll be sold on it because it's a great game, and they won't be satisfied to stay [at home] but will turn out to the rinks." As an experiment in the <a href="1956%E2%80%9357%20NHL%20season">1956–57 season</a>, <a href="CBS">CBS</a> first broadcast hockey games in the United States. Amazed with the initial popularity of the broadcasts, it inaugurated a 21-game package of games the following year. The NHL itself adapted to become viewer-friendly. In 1949, to make the puck easier to see, the league mandated the ice surface painted white. In 1951, so each team was distinguishable on black and white television, the League required home teams wear colored jerseys, and the road teams wear white. For the same reason, teams painted the centre red line in a checkered pattern to set it apart from the solid blue lines.

In the <a href="1951%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">1951 Stanley Cup Finals</a>, in the only final in NHL history when all games were decided in overtime, the Maple Leafs defeated the Canadiens four games to one. After dashing from his defensive position, despite an earlier warning from Smythe not to take unnecessary chances, Leafs' defenceman <a href="Bill%20Barilko">Bill Barilko</a> hammered the Cup-winning goal past Montreal goaltender <a href="Gerry%20McNeil">Gerry McNeil</a>. The goal completed Toronto's fourth Stanley Cup championship in five seasons, making Barilko a national hero. Four months later, Barilko and a friend disappeared in <a href="Northern%20Ontario">Northern Ontario</a>, where they had flown on a fishing trip. Barilko's disappearance became front page news across Canada; a massive search failed to locate the missing plane. Barilko's remains were not found until 1962, the first year the Maple Leafs won the Cup since Barilko's overtime winner eleven years previous. Barilko's disappearance was immortalized 40 years later by Canadian rock band <a href="The%20Tragically%20Hip">The Tragically Hip</a> in their 1992 song "<a href="Fifty%20Mission%20Cap">Fifty Mission Cap</a>".

By 1962, the disappearance of Bill Barilko and the Maple Leafs' subsequent failure to win the Stanley Cup led Toronto fans to believe a curse was upon the team. The Leafs won the 1962 championship shortly before Barilko's remains were discovered. In 1963, they repeated as champions. In 1964, the Leafs again played for the Stanley Cup against the Red Wings. In the third period of game six, trailing the series 3–2, Maple Leafs' defenceman <a href="Bobby%20Baun">Bobby Baun</a> suffered a broken ankle from a <a href="Gordie%20Howe">Gordie Howe</a> slap shot. Despite the injury, Baun returned with his ankle taped up to score the winning goal in overtime. Baun also played the seventh game as the Maple Leafs defeated the Red Wings to win their third consecutive title.

Beginning in <a href="1948%E2%80%9349%20NHL%20season">1948–49</a>, the Red Wings went on to win seven consecutive regular season titles - a feat no other team has accomplished. During that time, the Wings won four Stanley Cups. During the <a href="1952%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">1952 Stanley Cup Finals</a> the <a href="Legend%20of%20the%20Octopus">Legend of the Octopus</a> was created. For the fourth game of the finals, brothers Pete and Jerry Cusimano brought a dead octopus to the <a href="Detroit%20Olympia">Detroit Olympia</a>. At the time, they reasoned the eight tentacles of an octopus represented the eight wins required to win the Stanley Cup. The Wings had won seven consecutive playoff games, and the brothers hoped the octopus would inspire Detroit to an eighth victory. The tradition was born, as Detroit handily defeated Montreal 3–0.

During this time, the Wings were led by <a href="Gordie%20Howe">Gordie Howe</a>. In 1943, at the age of 15, Howe was invited to the Rangers player camp in <a href="Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a>; but quickly became homesick and failed to favorably impress the Rangers coaches. The next season the Red Wings invited him to their camp, where coach <a href="Jack%20Adams%20%28ice%20hockey%20b.%201895%29">Jack Adams</a> called him "the best prospect I've seen in 20 years." Two years later, at the age of 18, Howe debuted in the NHL for Detroit. On March 28, 1950, during a playoff game against the Leafs, Howe was nearly killed as he mistimed an attempted check on Toronto's <a href="Ted%20Kennedy%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Ted Kennedy</a>, causing him to slam head first into the boards. Rushed to hospital, doctors drilled a hole into Howe's skull to relieve pressure on his brain. Despite fears he would never play again, "Mr. Hockey" recovered to start the following season, then won his first of four consecutive scoring titles in <a href="1950%E2%80%9351%20NHL%20season">1950–51</a>. Howe was 52 years old when he retired from professional hockey.

In three consecutive seasons between 1954 and 1956, the Red Wings faced the Canadiens in the Stanley Cup Finals. Detroit won the first two match-ups, however, Montreal captured the 1956 Stanley Cup, ending one dynasty and starting another. Subsequently, the Canadiens won five consecutive championships between 1956 and 1960, a feat no other team has duplicated.

In 1953, the Canadiens signed <a href="Jean%20B%C3%A9liveau">Jean Beliveau</a>; a well-anticipated prospect in the NHL for years. Because his <a href="Quebec%20Senior%20Hockey%20League">Quebec Senior Hockey League</a> team, the <a href="Quebec%20Aces">Quebec Aces</a>, matched any contract offer the Canadiens made, Beliveau repeatedly refused to turn professional with Montreal. Ultimately, Montreal bought the entire league outright, along with the rights to all players, and turned it professional. Beliveau finally signed with Montreal for $105,000 over five years and a $20,000 bonus, an unprecedented contract for a rookie. Playing for Montreal, Beliveau went on to win ten Stanley Cups.

Led by Richard and Beliveau, the 1950s Canadiens had overwhelming offensive ability; to slow their offence the NHL amended its rules. To illustrate, the <a href="1955%E2%80%9356%20NHL%20season">1955–56</a> Canadiens frequently scored multiple goals during the same two-minute <a href="Power%20play%20%28sporting%20term%29">powerplay</a>. In one game against Boston, during a penalty, Beliveau scored three goals in 44 seconds. For the following season, the league instituted a rule permitting a player serving a minor penalty to return to the ice when a goal was scored against his team.

On January 18, 1958, by joining the Bruins as an 'injury call-up' for a game in Montreal, <a href="Willie%20O%27Ree">Willie O'Ree</a> became the first <a href="black%20Canadian">black</a> player in the NHL. Playing only two games with the Bruins in the <a href="1957%E2%80%9358%20NHL%20season">1957–58 season</a>, O'Ree returned in <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20NHL%20season">1960–61</a>, playing another 43 games with Boston. Although he only played 45 NHL games, scoring four goals, he earned the label the "<a href="Jackie%20Robinson">Jackie Robinson</a> of hockey".

Throughout the season, O'Ree faced blatant racism from opponents, remarking "people just wanted a piece of me, maybe because they thought I was different, so I had to defend myself. I wasn't going to be run out of any rink." He endured racial slurs from fans in each of Chicago, Detroit and New York, though the taunts were largely absent in Montreal and Toronto. O'Ree was supported by his teammates and Boston fans. He stated "they were mean to me in places like Detroit and New York, too. But never in Boston. I'll never forget how my teammates there took care of me — men like <a href="Johnny%20Bucyk">Johnny Bucyk</a>, <a href="Doug%20Mohns">Doug Mohns</a>, <a href="Charlie%20Burns%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Charlie Burns</a> and <a href="Don%20McKenney">Don McKenney</a>. They accepted me totally. All of them had class." In 1961, O'Ree was traded to Montreal but was unable to crack the Canadiens' line-up. Playing over 20 minor league seasons, O'Ree twice won the <a href="Western%20Hockey%20League%20%28minor%20pro%29">Western Hockey League</a>'s scoring title: in 1964, with the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Blades">Los Angeles Blades</a>, and in 1969, with the <a href="San%20Diego%20Gulls%20%281966-1974%29">San Diego Gulls</a>.

O'Ree's breakthrough came several years after another black player, <a href="Herb%20Carnegie">Herb Carnegie</a> was denied the same opportunity. In 1938–39, playing junior hockey with the <a href="Ontario%20Hockey%20Association">Ontario Hockey Association</a>'s <a href="Toronto%20Young%20Rangers">Toronto Rangers</a>, during a practice Carnegie was pulled aside by his coach and told "See that man sitting in the blues? That's Conn Smythe, owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs. He says he'd take you tomorrow if he could turn you white." Stung by the comments, Carnegie resolved to excel at the game. He was offered a tryout with the Rangers in 1950, then a spot on their lowest minor league team. "They told me that if I signed with the Rangers and went to New Haven, I would make international headlines. I told them my family couldn't eat headlines. That was probably when the Rangers decided to forget about me."

During the 1960s, it was often joked "NHL" stood for "Norris House League" because the Norris family held interests in several league teams. <a href="James%20D.%20Norris">James D. Norris</a> was co-owner of the Black Hawks along with <a href="Arthur%20Wirtz">Arthur Wirtz</a>; his brother <a href="Bruce%20Norris%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Bruce</a> inherited ownership of the Red Wings. James D. Norris was also the largest shareholder in <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden">Madison Square Garden</a>, giving him control over the Rangers.

The Black Hawks qualified for the playoffs only once between 1949 and 1957. The team's fortunes turned in <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20NHL%20season">1958–59</a>, following the acquisition of <a href="Ted%20Lindsay">Ted Lindsay</a> and <a href="Glenn%20Hall">Glenn Hall</a> from Detroit. Making the playoffs, the Black Hawks lost to Montreal in the semi-finals in 1959 and 1960, before capturing their first championship in 23 years, in the <a href="1961%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">1961 Stanley Cup Finals</a>. Chicago next won the Cup 49 years later in the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20NHL%20season">2009-10 season</a>.

The Hawks' resurgence in the 1960s led Norris and Wirtz to take advantage of their customers. Dubbed the "Chicken Wings" by fans, the Hawks were famous for fleecing fans. Ticket sellers were arrested for scalping; the team charged $9 for playoff tickets in 1965, $3 more than Detroit, Toronto or Montreal. The Hawks also refused to broadcast road playoff games in Chicago, preferring to charge fans to watch the games via closed-circuit television at <a href="Chicago%20Stadium">Chicago Stadium</a>. Fans responded by littering the ice and passing out leaflets urging a boycott of the team during Chicago's last regular season game in <a href="1964%E2%80%9365%20NHL%20season">1964–65</a>.

In 1963, Rangers governor <a href="William%20M.%20Jennings">William Jennings</a> introduced to his peers the idea of expanding the league to the <a href="American%20West%20Coast">American West Coast</a> by adding two new teams for the 1964–65 season. His argument was based around concerns the Western Hockey League intended to operate in the near future as a major league. Jennings also hoped inclusion of teams on the west coast would make the league truly national, and thereby, improve the chances of returning to television in the United States as the NHL had lost its deal with CBS. While the governors did not agree to the proposal, the topic of expansion surfaced every time the owners met subsequently. In 1965, there was agreement to expand by six teams, doubling the size of the NHL. San Francisco–Oakland and Vancouver were declared "acceptable cities" with Los Angeles and St. Louis as potential sites. Fourteen applications were received from across Canada and the United States, including four from Los Angeles.

In February 1966, the governors met and awarded franchises to <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Kings">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="Minnesota%20North%20Stars">Minnesota</a>, <a href="Philadelphia%20Flyers">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="Pittsburgh%20Penguins">Pittsburgh</a>, <a href="Oakland%20Seals">San Francisco</a> and <a href="St.%20Louis%20Blues">St. Louis</a>. The league rejected bids from Baltimore, Buffalo and Vancouver. The six winning bids each paid $2 million for their franchises. St. Louis was awarded a franchise with no bid received. The league's decision to grant a franchise was contingent on a potential owner stepping forward - a decision influenced by the Norris and Wirtz families, who owned the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Arena">St. Louis Arena</a>.

Canadians were outraged no expansion teams were awarded to Canada. <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Canada">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Lester%20B.%20Pearson">Lester B. Pearson</a> stated: "the NHL decision to expand only in the U.S. impinges on the sacred principles of all Canadians." Maple Leafs coach <a href="Punch%20Imlach">Punch Imlach</a> stated Vancouver was "sold out" and Toronto and Montreal did not want to share television revenue with another Canadian team.

Leafs co-owner <a href="Stafford%20Smythe">Stafford Smythe</a> rejected accusations that he opposed expansion to Vancouver, pointing out that he had offered to build and operate an $8 million facility in the city's downtown area, a proposal that he contended made little sense unless Vancouver had an NHL team. However, Smythe's proposal was contingent on him acquiring the parcel of land required from the city, then valued at $2.5 million, for $1. The proposed transaction was defeated in a municipal referendum. Smythe therefore placed the blame for Vancouver's failed bid on the city: "Vancouver lost its chance the day it turned down the referendum on our arena proposal", Smythe said. "That proved to me that the people out there aren't interested in going major league."

The Original Six era ended with the <a href="1967%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">1967 Stanley Cup Finals</a> between the two-time defending champion Canadiens, and the Maple Leafs. The oldest team in the league, the third place Leafs were led in goal by 37-year-old <a href="Terry%20Sawchuk">Terry Sawchuk</a> and 42-year-old <a href="Johnny%20Bower">Johnny Bower</a>. Known as the "over the hill gang", in six games, Toronto became the oldest team to win the Cup, defeating the favored Canadiens. The Maple Leafs have not appeared in the Stanley Cup finals since.

In 1942, due to <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> related travel restrictions, league president <a href="Frank%20Calder">Frank Calder</a> abolished the 10-minute <a href="overtime%20%28ice%20hockey%29">overtime</a> for regular season games so teams could catch their trains without delay. With the war's conclusion, regular season overtime did not return, although playoff games continued until a winner was decided. Overtime was re-introduced in the regular <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20NHL%20season">1983–84 season</a>.

In 1943, to make it more entertaining, the rules committee looked to increase the game's speed. Rangers coach <a href="Frank%20Boucher">Frank Boucher</a> proposed the neutral zone divided by a <a href="hockey%20rink">centre red line</a>, so teams could pass the puck out of the defensive zone into their half of the neutral zone. Previously, the league required defensive players carry the puck from the defensive zone, not permitting a pass across the blue line. Introduced in <a href="1943%E2%80%9344%20NHL%20season">1943–44</a>, the new rule changed the game. Formerly, strong fore-checking pinned opponents in their own zone for minutes at a time; subsequently, teams rushed up the ice with defencemen passing to forwards beyond the blue line. Scoring increased 10% league-wide; four of six teams topped 200 goals, the first time teams did so. In the early 1960s, <a href="Stan%20Mikita">Stan Mikita</a> inadvertently introduced the curved blade to a <a href="ice%20hockey%20stick">hockey stick</a>. Cracking his blade during a practice and not wanting to retrieve another, Mikita shot the puck in anger. He noticed the curve in the cracked blade caused the puck to behave differently. Both Mikita and <a href="Bobby%20Hull">Bobby Hull</a> experimented with heating and bending their stick blade to create different curves. Using a curved blade, Mikita went on to win four <a href="Art%20Ross%20Trophy">Art Ross Trophies</a> as the NHL's leading scorer. He later said he regretted the idea: "It's one of the worst inventions in hockey, because it eliminated the use of the backhand."

The <a href="NHL%20Entry%20Draft">NHL Amateur Draft</a> was first held on June 5, 1963 at the <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20Hotel">Queen Elizabeth Hotel</a> in <a href="Montreal%2C%20Quebec">Montreal, Quebec</a>. Created by Campbell, it was meant to more evenly distribute talent. To that point, teams directly sponsored <a href="junior%20ice%20hockey">junior</a> clubs, buying a player's rights. A 16-year-old with the St. Michaels Juveniles, <a href="Garry%20Monahan">Garry Monahan</a>, was the first player selected in the 1963 draft. Monahan remains the youngest player ever selected in an NHL draft. The Entry Draft system did not fully replace the sponsorship system until 1969.

Goaltender <a href="Clint%20Benedict">Clint Benedict</a> was the first to wear facial protection, donning it in 1930 to protect a broken nose. Because its design interfered with his vision, Benedict quickly abandoned the mask. Twenty-nine years later, <a href="Jacques%20Plante">Jacques Plante</a> made the goalie mask a permanent fixture in hockey. In 1956, Plante began wearing a mask in practice after shots from teammates twice broke cheekbones. Montreal coach <a href="Toe%20Blake">Toe Blake</a> refused to allow Plante to wear his mask in games. On November 1, 1959, in a game at <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden%20%281925%29">Madison Square Garden</a>, that changed, when Plante was struck in the face. Teams did not dress backup goaltenders; the game was delayed 20 minutes, while doctors frantically stitched up Plante. When Blake asked Plante if he was 'ready to return', Plante refused unless allowed to wear his mask. Livid, Blake agreed only if Plante removed the mask when his face was healed. Wearing the mask, Plante led the Canadiens on an 18-game unbeaten streak, to finally remove the mask at Blake's urging; promptly the team lost their first game. Defeated, Blake relented. Plante's mask became a permanent fixture as he led the Canadiens to their fifth consecutive Stanley Cup. Soon after, other goalies followed Plante's lead.

Remarkably, <a href="Terry%20Sawchuk">Terry Sawchuk</a> played goal for most of his career not wearing a mask; he crouched very low such that his shoulders nearly touched his knees. This stance became known as the "gorilla crouch". During his career, Sawchuk relied on his ability to see the puck under the players' bodies, his outstanding mobility, and reflexes, to win four <a href="Vezina%20Trophy">Vezina Trophies</a>. By 1955, he was regarded as the greatest goaltender to ever play the game. Sawchuk's career was cut short when he died in 1970 from injuries suffered in a drunken incident with teammate <a href="Ron%20Stewart">Ron Stewart</a>. The Hall of Fame waived its waiting period, immediately inducting Sawchuk as the NHL's all-time record holder in wins (447) and shutouts (103). Sawchuk's style of play was a precursor to the modern goaltending <a href="butterfly%20style">butterfly style</a>.

The butterfly style - used by most all modern goaltenders - was invented by <a href="Glenn%20Hall">Glenn Hall</a>. Considered both unique and foolish, Hall's style of dropping to his knees and kicking his pads out in a V formation forced shooters to aim for the top half of the net. Hall adopted the technique as a youth when he lacked the arm strength to stop shots with his stick. An eight-time All-Star, Hall became an NHL regular at the start of the 1955–1956 season to begin a sequence of 502 consecutive games as goaltender for Detroit and Chicago. This record is hailed as one of the NHL's most unbreakable.

The first players' union was formed February 12, 1957 by Red Wings player <a href="Ted%20Lindsay">Ted Lindsay</a>, who had sat on the board of the NHL's Pension Society since 1952. Lindsay and his fellow players were upset by the league's refusal to let them view the books related to the pension fund. The league claimed that it was barely breaking even financially, and so could not contribute more than it did. Players on the Pension Committee suspected otherwise, leading Lindsay and <a href="Doug%20Harvey%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Doug Harvey</a> of the Canadiens to discussions on forming a union in 1956. The idea quickly gained popularity and when the union's founding was announced publicly, every NHL player had signed up with the exception of <a href="Ted%20Kennedy%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Ted Kennedy</a>, who was retiring.

The owners immediately worked to crush the union. Toronto owner <a href="Conn%20Smythe">Conn Smythe</a> compared the players association to communism: "I feel that anything spawned in secrecy as this association was certainly has to have some odour to it." Red Wings president <a href="Bruce%20Norris%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Bruce Norris</a> responded by trading Lindsay to his brother's team, the Black Hawks. The move was widely seen as punitive, as the Hawks had finished last in the NHL every season, save one, from 1949 until 1957. Lindsay was not the only player sent to Chicago as punishment; Glenn Hall was included as he refused to distance himself from Lindsay. In Toronto, Smythe repeatedly benched <a href="Jimmy%20Thomson%20%28ice%20hockey%20b.%201927%29">Jim Thomson</a>, who was the union's secretary, before also dealing him to the Black Hawks. The Players' Association responded by filing a $3 million <a href="Competition%20law">antitrust</a> lawsuit against the NHL. Persuaded by teammates <a href="Gordie%20Howe">Gordie Howe</a> and <a href="Red%20Kelly">Red Kelly</a>, the Red Wings players voted to withdraw from the association in November 1957. Other teams quickly followed, and the union capitulated. Union leadership ultimately agreed to drop the lawsuit in exchange for small concessions, which included a minimum annual salary of $7,000, increases to the pension contributions and moving expenses for traded players.

Led by <a href="Alan%20Eagleson">Alan Eagleson</a>, the <a href="National%20Hockey%20League%20Players%27%20Association">National Hockey League Players' Association</a> (NHLPA) was formed in 1967. Eagleson became the sport's first <a href="sports%20agent">player agent</a> in 1966 when he negotiated a deal on behalf of <a href="Bobby%20Orr">Bobby Orr</a> with the Bruins that saw the 18-year-old rookie become the highest paid player in the NHL. At its peak, Eagleson's practice represented 150 professional athletes. Eagleson had also helped settle an <a href="American%20Hockey%20League">American Hockey League</a> players strike sparked by mistreatment of players. In June 1967, the NHLPA was announced, and quickly received acceptance from the owners.

Early life of Keith Miller

This article chronicles the life of <a href="Keith%20Miller">Keith Miller</a>, an Australian <a href="Test%20cricket">Test cricket</a>er and <a href="Australian%20rules%20football">Australian rules football</a>er, from his birth on 28 November 1919 until 20 August 1940, when he left civilian life and joined the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">Militia (army reserve)</a> during World War II. Born in the town of <a href="Sunshine%2C%20Victoria">Sunshine</a> on the outskirts of <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, Miller made sport the focal point of his early life. The youngest of four children of Scottish descent, Miller joined his siblings in being inculcated with a love of sport by their father, playing football in winter and cricket in summer. Miller's father—an engineer and sportslover—emphasised the importance of technique over power; Miller benefited as he was of small stature during his childhood and could not rely on brute strength. Miller yearned to be a <a href="horse%20racing">horse racing</a> jockey, as he felt that he would not have the physique to succeed in cricket or football.

Miller received his secondary education at the academically selective <a href="Melbourne%20High%20School">Melbourne High School</a>, where his mathematics teacher was the incumbent Australian cricket captain <a href="Bill%20Woodfull">Bill Woodfull</a>. He was an academically poor student who neglected his studies but excelled at sports. He made the school's first-choice cricket team at the age of 14 and gained attention for his technical and defensive ability, which was compared to that of Woodfull. Miller was rejected by the <a href="St%20Kilda%20Cricket%20Club">St Kilda Cricket Club</a> so he joined <a href="Casey-South%20Melbourne%20Cricket%20Club">South Melbourne</a> in <a href="Victorian%20Premier%20Cricket">district competition</a>, making his <a href="grade%20cricket">first-grade</a> debut at the start of the 1935–36 season, still only tall. In one match, he scored 61 <a href="run%20%28cricket%29">runs</a> to orchestrate a <a href="batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">lower-order</a> fightback in a low-scoring match against Woodfull's <a href="Carlton%20Cricket%20Club">Carlton</a> team, prompting his teacher to award him a silver eggcup during maths class. It remained one of his most treasured possessions.

In the following year, Miller grew and began to play cricket and football with more power. Leaving school at the end of year 10, having just turned 17, Miller played cricket for the Victorian Colts for two seasons, before breaking through to be selected for his <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class</a> debut late in the 1937–38 season. He played sporadically until making his <a href="Sheffield%20Shield">Sheffield Shield</a> debut during the 1939–40 season and scoring his maiden <a href="century%20%28cricket%29">century</a>. During this time, Miller played exclusively as a batsman; he was yet to become a <a href="fast%20bowling">fast bowler</a>. Miller's football career also took off. Starting in 1937, Miller played for the <a href="Brighton%20Football%20Club">Brighton Football Club</a> in the <a href="Victorian%20Football%20Association">Victorian Football Association</a> for three years, mainly as a defender. At the start of his fourth season, he restricted <a href="Bob%20Pratt">Bob Pratt</a>, regarded as the best forward of the time, to one goal for the match and was named best on ground. He was promptly signed by the <a href="St%20Kilda%20Football%20Club">St Kilda Football Club</a> to play in the leading <a href="Victorian%20Football%20League%20%281897%E2%80%931989%29">Victorian Football League</a> in 1940, where his team came second to last.

Born in the western <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> suburb of <a href="Sunshine%2C%20Victoria">Sunshine</a> on 28 November 1919, Keith Ross Miller was the youngest of Leslie (Les Sr) and Edith (Edie) Miller's four children. He had two older brothers and a sister. Sister Gladys was 12 when Miller was born, while Les Jr and Ray were nine and seven respectively. Miller was named after the Australian pioneer aviator brothers <a href="Keith%20Macpherson%20Smith">Keith</a> and <a href="Ross%20Macpherson%20Smith">Ross Smith</a>, who were half-way through their historic <a href="England%20to%20Australia%20flight">flight from England to Australia</a> at the time of his birth. Miller's two Christian names reflected his <a href="Scottish%20people">Scottish</a> heritage; his father's family originated from the dock area of <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> and <a href="Dundee">Dundee</a>, and his paternal grandfather arrived in Australia in April 1849. The family lived in a one-level terrace house in Sunshine, which at the time was a separate town of 900 people, west of Melbourne's city centre. The area was and remains a working-class area. The town's lifeblood was the farm machinery maker <a href="H.%20V.%20McKay">H. V. McKay</a>, which employed a large proportion of the population. Miller's father started as a teacher in <a href="Warracknabeal%2C%20Victoria">Warracknabeal</a> in rural Victoria, before working as an engineer for McKay in <a href="Ballarat">Ballarat</a> until a transfer brought him to Sunshine.

Sunshine offered open fields, and the three Miller boys quickly took a liking to sport during their childhood, playing <a href="Australian%20rules%20football">Australian rules football</a> in winter and <a href="cricket">cricket</a> in summer. Their father had played cricket for Warracknabeal, winning a premiership in the local league in 1900. Les taught the boys to play with a side-on stance and underlined the importance of orthodox batting technique, reminding his sons to maintain a high leading elbow when hitting the ball. They were taught to rely on a solid defence, concentration, and self-control in the mould of the leading Victorian and Australian Test batsman of the era, <a href="Bill%20Ponsford">Bill Ponsford</a>. Miller began his schooling in Sunshine, where he quickly became known for his diminutive height; he was one of the smallest children in the school. At the age of seven, Miller moved to the inner-eastern middle-class Melbourne suburb of <a href="Elsternwick%2C%20Victoria">Elsternwick</a>, where his parents had purchased a two-storey house with a spacious garden that allowed the children to play sport. By this time, his elder brothers had given him the derisive nickname "Weedy". Miller's small size and age deficit meant that he conceded a strength advantage to his brothers in <a href="backyard%20cricket">backyard cricket</a> matches. This forced him to develop his technique rather than rely on power, which held him in good stead for his future career. Whenever Miller managed to <a href="dismissal%20%28cricket%29">dismiss</a> his brothers and earn himself some batting time, he typically played with a straight bat in a watchful manner, as it was difficult for him to remove his brothers, meaning that his opportunities with the bat were rare. Miller and his friends would loiter outside Ponsford's home, just away, in the hope of catching a glimpse of their hero. Like Miller in his backyard, Ponsford was known for his powers of concentration and was the first person to score two quadruple centuries in <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a>. Miller often practised for hours by himself; he put a tennis ball inside a stocking, before suspending it from a clothes line and hitting it back and forth. Indoors, Miller developed a lifelong love of <a href="classical%20music">classical music</a> through a cousin who liked to play <a href="Mozart">Mozart</a>. He played <a href="flute">flute</a> in the Elsternwick school band but could not read music.

As a small child, Miller's major sporting aspiration was to be a <a href="jockey">jockey</a>, but he continued to play cricket and Australian football. At the age of 12, he played for an under-15 Victorian schoolboys cricket team that toured <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> under the captaincy of future Test batsman <a href="Merv%20Harvey">Merv Harvey</a>. At the time, Miller stood only and wielded a sawn-off bat. His shots did not travel far, but he impressed observers with the manner in which he moved his feet and stroked the ball. Miller's small stature in a contact sport such as football forced him to rely on physical courage, something for which he became famed. However, his lack of height prompted him to turn to horseracing. Miller saw his first <a href="Melbourne%20Cup">Melbourne Cup</a> in 1926 at the age of seven and had been fascinated ever since. <a href="Caulfield%20Racecourse">Caulfield Racecourse</a> was only a short distance from the family home, and Miller spent many early mornings watching the trainers and jockeys go through their routines. He eventually persuaded his father to let him take horseriding lessons. Aside from being attracted to the racing culture, Miller felt that as he appeared destined to be a small person, he was more likely to have a successful career as a jockey than in cricket or football.

Miller went to the local state school before transferring to <a href="Melbourne%20High%20School">Melbourne High School</a>—a selective government institution that accepted students through an academic exam—at the start of 1934. The school's emphasis on scholastic and sporting excellence and its culture was more in line with that of a private school than a standard government school. <a href="Australia%20national%20cricket%20team">Australian</a> Test captain <a href="Bill%20Woodfull">Bill Woodfull</a> was on the teaching staff as Miller's mathematics teacher. Because he did little study and focused his energy on sport, Miller was a mediocre student. In addition to cricket and football, Miller played baseball and competed in swimming. This disappointed Woodfull, a disciplined man who invoked the school's motto "Honour the Work" in exhorting his students to work hard as Australia was attempting to emerge from the depths of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>. Despite being Australia's captain, Woodfull refused to involve himself in the coaching of the school's cricket teams, feeling that it would intrude on the responsibilities of the sports teachers. Despite this, Woodfull watched the students at cricket training and quickly noticed Miller's skills. Aged 14 and still under , Miller was selected in the school's <a href="First%20XI">First XI</a>. With his <a href="batting%20pads">pads</a> flapping against his stomach and sporting a sawn-down bat, Miller batted at No. 6 and scored 44 on his senior debut. Although his lack of power was obvious, Miller's control and solidity prompted the spectators to call him "the Unbowlable", the same nickname that was accorded to Woodfull, who had a similarly strong defensive style. Melbourne went on to win the match, and Miller impressed his captain <a href="Keith%20Truscott">Keith Truscott</a>, who fought for his selection and took him under his wing. Truscott later became an ace fighter pilot in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a>, and Miller would follow in his footsteps. Truscott's social influence compounded the distractions from Miller's study. Miller failed all eight of his subjects at the end of 1934, and with an average mark of 25%, was the class <a href="dunce">dunce</a>. He scored zero in his final exam for Woodfull's geometry class, and was forced to repeat year 9.

At the start of the 1934–35 season, Truscott took Miller to a try out with <a href="St%20Kilda%20Cricket%20Club">St Kilda Cricket Club</a>, but his protege could not find a place in any of the club's five teams. Joining the local <a href="Victorian%20Sub-District%20Cricket%20Association">sub-district</a> cricket club Elsternwick, Miller did not get to bat or bowl on debut, and was then dropped to the Second XI after his first match for poor fielding. Nevertheless, the former <a href="Victorian%20Bushrangers">Victorian</a> state player <a href="Hughie%20Carroll">Hughie Carroll</a> spotted Miller's talent and lured him to the rival <a href="Casey-South%20Melbourne%20Cricket%20Club">South Melbourne</a> club. However, Elsternwick used the competition rules to prevent Miller from playing for Souths, so he continued to play in the former's second-choice team. In the meantime, Miller continued to play for his school with steady results, scoring 30 and 25 in two matches against Melbourne's main rival, <a href="University%20High%20School%2C%20Melbourne">University High School</a>. A loosening of the zoning rules allowed Miller to start competing for South Melbourne in the following season. However, the rules required South Melbourne to play Miller in their First XI, else St Kilda could reclaim him, so he made his <a href="Victorian%20Premier%20Cricket">district cricket</a> debut for South at the start of the 1935–36 season after a trial in the nets. At this stage, Miller was just tall—the Test batsman <a href="Keith%20Rigg">Keith Rigg</a> recalled his first encounter with the diminutive youngster in a district match:
It was at South Melbourne that Miller met <a href="Ian%20Johnson%20%28cricketer%29">Ian Johnson</a> and <a href="Lindsay%20Hassett">Lindsay Hassett</a>, his future Australia teammates and captains. On debut against St Kilda, Miller scored only 11 <a href="not%20out">not out</a> after batting for 62 minutes at No. 7, but observers felt the young batsman would succeed if he physically grew. Miller passed his exams at the end of 1935 and continued his development on the field. He began to develop a <a href="leg%20break">leg break</a> and <a href="googly">googly</a> and represented his school against a visiting schoolboy team from <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Ceylon</a>. Miller scored an unbeaten 28 to prevent a loss and later cited the experience as helping to broaden his horizons towards other cultures. Assisted by cross-training in baseball, his improved fielding skills saw him placed in the <a href="slips%20%28cricket%29">slips</a> and he was named as Melbourne High School's cricket sports champion for 1936. Miller averaged 86 with the bat and took 13 <a href="wicket">wicket</a>s at an average of 9.23, including <a href="innings">innings</a> figures of seven wickets for 29 runs against St Kevin's and 3/5 against University High. These performances prompted Woodfull to write in the school magazine that "Miller has Test possibilities". 

In March, Miller played for South Melbourne against <a href="Carlton%20Cricket%20Club">Carlton</a>, who were captained by Woodfull. South Melbourne batted first and collapsed to 5/6. The sixth wicket fell at 32, bringing Miller to the crease. He guided his team to 141, and was the last man out for 61 after putting on a stand of 65 in 95 minutes with the No. 11. Miller struck four boundaries in a 147-minute innings. The crowd of 14,000—the largest of the season—gave Miller a standing ovation, and newspapers compared him to Ponsford and <a href="Alan%20Kippax">Alan Kippax</a>. Carlton went on to win the game, and when it was obvious that this would be the case, Miller's captain let him bowl for the first time. The small batsman took his first wicket in district cricket when Test paceman <a href="Laurie%20Nash">Laurie Nash</a> took a high-leaping catch. Miller's performance prompted Carlton to donate a silver eggcup as a memento "for sterling performance". Woodfull presented Miller with the trophy during algebra class. It was one of the few sports trophies that Miller kept in later life.

During 1936, Miller underwent a sudden growth spurt, including a three-month period during which he added to his height. He began to play football with more physical aggression and developed the ability to leap high and take airborne <a href="mark%20%28Australian%20football%29">marks</a>. The increase in size allowed Miller to become the longest kicker in the school team. Having grown in a year, Miller was unrecognisable to Hassett upon his return to South Melbourne the following season. Eventually, Miller reached in height, thwarting his ambition to be a jockey, although he never lost his love for the racetrack.

At the start of the 1936–37 season, Miller was selected for the Colts, a state under-21 team that played at district level. At the end of the 1936 school year, Miller completed year 10 by passing five of his eight subjects. Disinclined towards university studies, he left school without finishing his leaving year and began working as a clerk for a car business. Miller felt confident that he could make a career out of sport and therefore felt that further education was unnecessary.

Miller spent the 1937–38 season with the Colts and won the team's batting trophy for having the best average; he made 340 runs at 42.50. Across the entire competition, Miller had the eighth highest average. He scored three half-centuries and a 102 against Northcote. At this stage, Miller was a solid, slow and steady batsman, who accumulated his runs gradually, but "<a href="The%20Age">The Age</a>" predicted that his physical growth would open his horizons, opining "Once he fills out—he is rather tall for his weight—Miller should become a brilliant, aggressive batsman". In early February 1938, late in the summer, he made his <a href="First-class%20cricket">first-class</a> debut for <a href="Victorian%20Bushrangers">Victoria</a> as an 18-year-old and hit 181 in 289 minutes against <a href="Tasmanian%20Tigers">Tasmania</a> at the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Ground">Melbourne Cricket Ground</a>. With his increased power, Miller began to loft the ball over the infield and struck five fours. During the 1938–39 season, he rejoined South Melbourne and played four first-class matches for Victoria, scoring 125 runs at an average of 25.00. However, Miller was yet to play in the <a href="Sheffield%20Shield">Sheffield Shield</a> competition, only taking to the field in one-off matches against other teams. In the two matches against Tasmania in December 1938, Miller took his first catch, but managed only four, seven <a href="not%20out">not out</a> and three, and he spent a period of time outside the team. Miller was recalled in March 1939—late in the season—for two matches against <a href="Western%20Warriors">Western Australia</a> in Perth, scoring 111 runs at 37.00, notching his first first-class fifty of the season in the second innings of the first match.

Miller achieved more success as a footballer. In 1937, he followed his brothers Les and Ray and joined the <a href="Brighton%20Football%20Club">Brighton Football Club</a> in the <a href="Victorian%20Football%20Association">Victorian Football Association</a> (VFA). The VFA was the second tier of Australian rules football below the <a href="Victorian%20Football%20League%20%281897%E2%80%931989%29">Victorian Football League</a> (VFL). A defender, Miller played his first two seasons on the flanks; he was yet to reach his physical peak and lacked the power required to play in central defensive positions until his third season, in 1939. At this stage, he was unable to <a href="hip%20and%20shoulder">hip and shoulder</a> his opponents and relied on his running ability and accurate kicking.
During the 1939–40 season, Miller was selected to make his Sheffield Shield debut in a match against <a href="Southern%20Redbacks">South Australia</a> at <a href="Adelaide%20Oval">Adelaide Oval</a>. Batting at No. 4, Miller came to the crease at 2/9 after a top-order collapse, but managed only four runs before being caught by <a href="Richard%20Whitington">Richard Whitington</a>—with whom he later wrote cricket books—from the bowling of <a href="Harold%20Cotton%20%28cricketer%29">Harold Cotton</a>. When Victoria fielded, Miller <a href="run%20out">ran out</a> his future "Invincibles" captain <a href="Don%20Bradman">Don Bradman</a>; it was the first time that Bradman had been caught short of his ground in first-class cricket. Miller also took his first catch at Shield level, that of <a href="Mervyn%20Waite">Mervyn Waite</a>. In the second innings, he managed seven before being bowled by <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a>ner <a href="Clarrie%20Grimmett">Clarrie Grimmett</a>, one of the leading bowlers in the world in the 1930s. One of Miller's teammates was <a href="Percy%20Beames">Percy Beames</a>, who also happened to be his manager at <a href="Vacuum%20Oil">Vacuum Oil</a>, where he had moved from his first job. Miller made 41 and 47 not out in his second match against <a href="Queensland%20Bulls">Queensland</a>, top-scoring in the second innings as his team completed a seven-wicket victory. Miller retained his place for the match against <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team">New South Wales</a>, but was out for 14 in both innings. He had difficulties against leg spin, falling to <a href="Bill%20O%27Reilly%20%28cricketer%29">Bill O'Reilly</a> and <a href="Cec%20Pepper">Cec Pepper</a>. In the return match against South Australia, Miller decided to take the initiative against Grimmett, charging down the wicket to drive the leg spinner. He featured in a 165-run partnership with Hassett, and at times bluffed Grimmett by moving forward before leaning back after the bowler had adjusted his length. Miller reached 108 to complete his first century in Shield competition. He was given out caught by Bradman from Garth Burton, after an appeal for a disputed catch; Miller asked the umpires if Bradman had caught a <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23B">bump ball</a>. Nevertheless, Bradman praised Miller's innings, and <a href="Clem%20Hill">Clem Hill</a> predicted a bright future for the Victorian. Apart from the century, Miller had an average season, making 37, 1 and 24 in his remaining innings to end the campaign with 298 runs at 29.80. He did not bowl during the season.

In 1940, Miller started his fourth season in the VFA. In a match against <a href="Coburg%20Tigers">Coburg</a>, regarded as one of the strongest teams in the competition, he was assigned to man <a href="Bob%20Pratt">Bob Pratt</a>, who was regarded as the greatest forward of the era. Pratt had scored 678 goals in ten seasons for <a href="Sydney%20Swans">South Melbourne</a> in the <a href="Victorian%20Football%20League%20%281897%E2%80%931989%29">Victorian Football League</a> (VFL), the top tier of football, and had scored more than 100 goals in each of his last three seasons. Miller restricted Pratt to one goal for the match and was named as the best on ground. In the third quarter, Miller restricted Pratt to two marks, and in the fourth quarter, he prevented the forward from getting a single kick. Scouts from the VFL club <a href="St%20Kilda%20Football%20Club">St Kilda</a> signed Miller on the spot. Reacting to Miller's signing, "The Age" opined that he "is one of the most promising players ever to enter league ranks, and can be played anywhere in defence. It was he who kept Bob Pratt to one goal in last week's Association match."

At the time, World War II had broken out and by mid-1940, France, Belgium and the Netherlands had fallen to <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. Australia had declared war on Germany and Miller wanted to join the military, but St Kilda told him that if he was deployed outside Victoria, his career would be in jeopardy. As a result, Miller postponed his enlistment until the end of the season.

Playing as a defender, Miller debuted for St Kilda in their fifth round home game against <a href="Carlton%20Blues">Carlton</a>, at the <a href="Junction%20Oval">Junction Oval</a> on 25 May, playing on the half-back flank. At the start of the game, Miller's opponent <a href="Ron%20Cooper%20%28Australian%20footballer%29">Ron Cooper</a> <a href="wikt%3Aking%20hit">king hit</a> and concussed him. Miller said of the experience, "I learnt more in a second or two than I would have in a year". When St Kilda met Carlton in the return match at <a href="Visy%20Park">Princes Park</a>, Miller <a href="wikt%3Ashoulder%20bumped">shoulder bumped</a> Cooper in the first minute of the match, forcing his opponent to leave the field. In a match against <a href="Richmond%20Tigers">Richmond</a>, Miller was physically targeted by renowned enforcer <a href="Jack%20Dyer">Jack Dyer</a>, known as "Captain Blood". However, Dyer slipped and missed Miller. In one game, Miller was reported for showing dissent to a <a href="goal%20umpire">goal umpire</a>, but was let off without punishment. St Kilda came second to last, so they did not make the <a href="Page%E2%80%93McIntyre%20system">finals</a>.

Keith Miller with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948

<a href="Keith%20Miller">Keith Miller</a> was a member of <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Donald Bradman</a>'s famous <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201948">Australian cricket team, which toured England in 1948</a> and went undefeated in its 34 matches. This unprecedented feat by a <a href="Test%20cricket">Test</a> side touring England earned the Australians the sobriquet "The Invincibles". Miller was an <a href="all-rounder">all-rounder</a>: a right-arm <a href="fast%20bowling">opening fast bowler</a> and a right-handed <a href="batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">middle-order</a> <a href="batting%20%28cricket%29">batsman</a>. With <a href="Ray%20Lindwall">Ray Lindwall</a>, he formed Australia's first-choice opening attack, a combination regarded as one of the best of all time. Miller was also a skillful <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">slip fielder</a>, regarded by his captain as the best in the world.

Miller played a vital role in the side's success in the Test series, particularly with the ball. Despite a back injury which meant he passed one Test without bowling, he took 13 <a href="wicket">wicket</a>s in the series at an <a href="bowling%20average">average</a> of 26.28, and also contributed 184 <a href="run%20%28cricket%29">runs</a> at an <a href="batting%20average">average</a> of 23.15. He played a key role in subduing England's leading batsmen, <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a> and <a href="Denis%20Compton">Denis Compton</a>, with a barrage of <a href="bouncer%20%28cricket%29">short-pitched bowling</a>, troubling Hutton to such an extent that he was dropped for the Third Test. In all <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class matches</a> on the tour, Miller scored 1,088 runs at 47.30 and took 56 wickets at 17.58. Bradman gave him a light bowling workload during the tour matches, to keep him fresh for the Test matches.

Miller's character, <a href="joie%20de%20vivre">joie de vivre</a> and love of cricket were expressed on the field during the tour, particularly in the tour games, when he played several carefree innings, hitting many <a href="six%20%28cricket%29">sixes</a>. He also showed his disdain for Bradman's obsession with annihilating the opposition. In one match against <a href="Essex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Essex</a>, he deliberately allowed himself to be <a href="bowled">bowled</a> first ball in protest against Australia's ruthless approach to batting; that day, his side set a world record for the most runs scored in a day of first-class cricket (721).

Miller's charisma—coupled with the unprecedented popularity of the Australians—meant that he was in demand at social events on the tour. His friendship with <a href="Princess%20Margaret">Princess Margaret</a> was also particularly scrutinised by the media.

Miller had played for Australia in every Test match since the resumption of international cricket after World War II. A specialist batsman before the war, he emerged as a frontline fast bowler during the <a href="Victory%20Tests">Victory Tests</a>, a series of friendly games between England and Australia in 1945. He made his official Test debut against <a href="New%20Zealand%20cricket%20team">New Zealand</a> in early 1946. Since the Test series against England during the 1946–47 Australian summer, he had opened the bowling with <a href="Ray%20Lindwall">Ray Lindwall</a> and played as a frontline batsman, usually at number five in the <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">batting order</a>. Miller played a leading role in Australia's 3–0 victory over the hosts in that series. He finished at the top of the Australian Test <a href="bowling%20average">bowling average</a>s with 16 wickets at 20.88, and was second in the <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a>s, scoring 384 runs at 76.80. In particular, his pace and intimidating <a href="bouncer%20%28cricket%29">bouncers</a> had troubled England's leading batsmen, <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a> and <a href="Denis%20Compton">Denis Compton</a>. He dismissed Hutton thrice and took the wicket of his opening partner <a href="Cyril%20Washbrook">Cyril Washbrook</a> twice. In addition to scoring his maiden Test <a href="century%20%28cricket%29">century</a> in the series, Miller also hit three scores over 150 for his state, <a href="Victorian%20Bushrangers">Victoria</a>; his runs were scored at a rapid pace and featured many powerful shots.

Miller had a light workload in the 1947–48 home Test series against <a href="India%20national%20cricket%20team">India</a>, which Australia won 4–0; his teammates often finished off the opposition before he had an opportunity, particularly with the bat. He was required to bat just once in each Test, accumulating 185 runs at 37.00, including two half-centuries. His 72 overs yielded nine wickets at 24.78. Lindwall and Miller were selected by captain <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Donald Bradman</a> and his fellow selectors for the 1948 tour of England as the intended new ball pairing.

Miller and his teammates arrived in <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a> in April after a sea voyage from Australia aboard the "<a href="SS%20Strathaird">SS Strathaird</a>". Following the custom for their tours of England, Australia fielded its first-choice team in the traditional opening game against <a href="Worcestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Worcestershire</a>. Miller was selected and started the "Invincibles" tour strongly. He scored a hard-hitting 50 <a href="not%20out">not out</a>, with five <a href="four%20%28cricket%29">fours</a> and a <a href="six%20%28cricket%29">six</a>, after coming in to bat at No. 9. He bowled 20 <a href="over%20%28cricket%29">overs</a> in the game for figures of 1/54, and Australia completed an innings victory.

The tour opener was followed by a game against <a href="Leicestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Leicestershire</a>; Miller was promoted to No. 3. At the fall of the first wicket, the crowd surged towards the players' gate, expecting Bradman to enter in his customary batting position. Miller emerged instead, and scored an unbeaten 202 in five and a half hours, although he was dropped three times. He featured in a 111-run second wicket <a href="partnership%20%28cricket%29">partnership</a> with <a href="Sid%20Barnes">Sid Barnes</a>, before putting on 159 with Bradman for the third wicket. After a late-order collapse, in which no other batsman passed 12, it was left to last man <a href="Bill%20Johnston%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Johnston</a> to partner Miller from 180 onwards. The pair put on 37 for the tenth wicket before Johnston was out for 12, allowing Miller to complete a double century. One of his sixes concussed a spectator. After his long innings, Miller did not bowl in the first innings, but was used late in the second innings and took 2/10. Australia completed another innings triumph.

The next match was against <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a>, for whom Hutton played; it gave both Miller and Hutton an opportunity to gain a psychological advantage before the Tests. In cold and blustery conditions, Miller reduced his pace and bowled medium-paced <a href="off%20break">off break</a>s, operating throughout most of the innings and taking 6/42 in 23.3 overs. He removed Hutton for five after the Yorkshireman had struggled for an hour in the middle. Yorkshire were all out for 71 on a <a href="sticky%20wicket">wet wicket</a>. In reply, Australia scored just 101; Miller scored a counter-attacking 34, the highest individual score in the match. He hit two sixes in his innings, including one from the first ball that he faced. He then took 3/49 in the second innings as Yorkshire were all out for 89 to leave Australia a victory target of 60. He was dismissed for two, caught at <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">long off</a> after attempting to hit a <a href="six%20%28cricket%29">six</a> from the spin of <a href="Johnny%20Wardle">Johnny Wardle</a> to leave Australia 3/13. The remaining batsmen struggled and Australia lost six wickets before scoring the winning runs; this was the closest the team came to defeat on the whole tour, and Miller's performance in the match was instrumental in preserving the unbeaten record.

After three consecutive three-day matches, which involved playing in nine days out of ten, Miller sat out the next match against <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a> at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a>, which Australia won by an innings. He returned to take seven wickets in the next fixture against <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Cambridge University</a>. In the first innings, he resumed his battle with <a href="John%20Dewes">John Dewes</a>, whom he had troubled during the Victory Tests in 1945. This time, Dewes put a thick towel under his shirt for protection against an anticipated <a href="bouncer%20%28cricket%29">short-pitched</a> barrage; instead, Miller followed a short ball with a <a href="yorker">yorker</a> to dismiss him. He then took the last three wickets to end with 5/46 as the hosts were bowled out for 167 in the first innings. Miller was not required to bat as Australia amassed 4/414 <a href="declaration%20and%20forfeiture">declared</a> then took 2/29 as his team completed an innings victory.

The next match was against <a href="Essex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Essex</a>. Australia, having elected to bat, had reached 2/364 when Miller came out to bat midway through the first day, after Bradman and <a href="Bill%20Brown%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Brown</a> had scored 219 runs for the second wicket in 90 minutes. Miller took guard and deliberately let his first ball, from <a href="Trevor%20Bailey">Trevor Bailey</a>, hit the stumps, much to Bradman's displeasure. Miller later said that he was making a protest against the one-sided nature of the contest; Australia went on to score 721 runs on the first day, a record number of runs in a single day of first-class cricket. The former Australian Test batsman <a href="Jack%20Fingleton">Jack Fingleton</a>, who covered the Australian tour as a journalist, said: "Under the circumstances at <a href="Southend">Southend</a>, I could well understand his [Miller's] feelings". When he bowled, Miller took Essex's first three wickets to reduce the hosts to 3/13, and ended with 3/14 in their total of 83. He bowled just two overs, without taking any more wickets, when Bradman enforced the <a href="follow%20on">follow on</a>; Australia won by an innings and 451 runs, its largest winning margin for the season. Bradman rested Miller for the next game against <a href="Oxford%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Oxford University</a>, which Australia won by an innings.

In the lead-up to the Tests, Australia took on the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC) at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a>. Bradman's men batted first, and Miller came to the crease at 3/200. Sharing partnerships of 80 runs for the fourth wicket with <a href="Lindsay%20Hassett">Lindsay Hassett</a>, 63 for the fifth with Brown and 155 with <a href="Ian%20Johnson%20%28cricketer%29">Ian Johnson</a> for the sixth, Miller scored 163 runs in 250 minutes, hitting 20 fours and three sixes. The Australians hit nine sixes off the <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a> bowling of <a href="Jim%20Laker">Jim Laker</a> on the second morning of the match in an attempt to establish their mastery of him before the Test series. After Miller's dismissal, Australia were out for 552. With the ball, Miller and Lindwall attempted to maintain their ascendancy over Hutton, who was playing for MCC. On this occasion, he scored 52 and 64, but MCC were defeated by an innings and 158 runs. Miller had figures of 3/28 and 1/37. He dismissed England Test batsman <a href="Bill%20Edrich">Bill Edrich</a>, who had been a prolific scorer in recent English seasons, and was expected to be one of the key batsmen in the forthcoming Ashes series. Miller twice took the wicket of <a href="Jack%20Robertson%20%28English%20cricketer%29">Jack Robertson</a>, who was thought to be in contention for England selection; after two low scores against Miller, he was overlooked. In addition to his performance on the field, Miller solved some off-field problems. The MCC—which administered cricket at the time—provided him with legal assistance in his contract dispute with <a href="Rawtenstall%20Cricket%20Club">Rawtenstall Cricket Club</a>. The Australian all-rounder had signed a contract to play for the club in the <a href="Lancashire%20League%20%28cricket%29">Lancashire League</a>, but failed to honour it. Rawtenstall dropped the dispute after being offered compensation.

Miller was rested for the next match against <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a>, which was drawn after the first day was lost to rain. He returned against <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a> and scored 51 of Australia's total of 400. Miller took a wicket in each innings, including that of Test batsman <a href="Reg%20Simpson">Reg Simpson</a>, to end with 2/67 as Australia drew its second consecutive match. In the next match, against <a href="Hampshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Hampshire</a>, Miller bowled 19 overs without reward, taking 0/39 as the home team batted first and scored 195. In reply, Australia was in trouble after rain turned the pitch into a <a href="sticky%20wicket">sticky wicket</a>. Miller came in at 2/38 and launched a counter-attack, scoring 39 of the 53 runs added before he fell with the score at 5/91. The Australians were all out for 117, conceding a first innings lead of 78, the first time during the tour that they had been behind on the first innings. Miller's top score of 39 included three consecutive sixes from the bowling of <a href="Charlie%20Knott">Charlie Knott</a>, who took 5/57. In Hampshire's second innings, he took 5/25 and <a href="bowled">bowled</a> three of his victims. The tourists dismissed Hampshire for 103, leaving a target of 182, which Australia achieved with eight wickets to spare without Miller having to bat. He was rested for the match against <a href="Sussex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Sussex</a> at <a href="Hove">Hove</a>, after six consecutive days of cricket. In its last match before the Tests, Australia completed an innings victory in just two days.

Before the Tests, Fingleton expected the English batsmen to struggle against Miller and Lindwall; he believed that, accustomed to prolific scoring against low-quality bowling in county cricket, these batsmen would be unable to adapt to the demands of facing world-class opposition. England won the toss and batted first on the opening morning of the First Test at <a href="Trent%20Bridge">Trent Bridge</a>. There had been overnight rain, which meant that the pitch would initially be favourable towards fast bowlers. Opening the bowling with Lindwall, Miller induced an <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23E">edge</a> from Washbrook in his first over, but it went to ground. In his second over, Miller bowled Hutton with a faster ball, leaving England at 1/9. In his second over, Miller <a href="bowled">bowled</a> Hutton for three with a faster ball that skidded off the pitch to leave England at 9/1. The journalist and former Australian Test leg spinner <a href="Bill%20O%27Reilly%20%28cricketer%29">Bill O'Reilly</a> criticised Hutton for not moving his leg across to the pitch of the ball, thereby leaving a gap between bat and pad, but praised Miller for his ability to make occasional deliveries skid on faster, surprising the batsman.

Miller beat Washbrook's bat twice in one over soon after lunch, but was unable to extract an edge. Miller held a catch—described by "Wisden" as "dazzling"—when <a href="Joe%20Hardstaff%20junior">Joe Hardstaff junior</a> edged Johnston into <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">the slips</a> and was out for a <a href="duck%20%28cricket%29">duck</a>. Two runs later, he bowled Compton, who was attempting a <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Sweep">leg sweep</a>. As a result, half the English team were out with only 48 runs on the board after 100 minutes of play. England fell to 8/74, but recovered with an 89-run ninth-wicket partnership between <a href="Alec%20Bedser">Alec Bedser</a> and Laker. Miller ended the innings by removing Laker—caught behind for 63—leaving England all out for 165. The paceman ended with 3/38 from 19 overs.

On the second day, Miller came in at 2/121—O'Reilly believed that Bradman was trying to force the pace and had promoted Miller above <a href="Lindsay%20Hassett">Lindsay Hassett</a>, the usual number four batsman—and was dismissed for a duck; he failed to pick Laker's <a href="arm%20ball">arm ball</a>, which went straight on instead of turning in, clipped the outside edge and was taken at <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">slip</a> by Edrich. After Australia finished at 509 on the third day to take a 344-run lead, Miller opened the bowling with Johnston—Lindwall was injured while bowling in the first innings and was unable to take to the field. Miller removed Washbrook for one, caught behind by Tallon from a top-edged <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Pull%20and%20hook">hook shot</a>. Washbrook was displeased with the decision and gestured to a red mark on his shirt, indicating his opinion that the ball hit his clothing rather than the bat.

Miller continued his battle with Hutton and Compton, although he resorted to bowling off spin from a shorter run to conserve energy late in the day. Hutton hit three fours in quick succession from Miller’s bowling to reach his fifty. The paceman responded to the spate of boundaries by reverting to pace and bowling a series of bouncers, including five in the last over of the day. One of these struck Hutton high on his left (front) arm. The batsmen survived, but the bowler received a hostile reaction from the crowd throughout his barrage of short-pitched bowling. Some of the spectators shouted "<a href="Bodyline">Bodyline</a>". Miller appeared to be amused by the crowd reaction and revelled in it, grinning and flicking his hair. Hutton responded by glancing Miller for a four from the final ball of the day. England were 2/121 at stumps on the third day, with Hutton and Compton still at the crease. Miller was jeered and heckled as he left the field at the end of play. The crowd surged towards him as he walked up the steps into the dressing room, but there was no altercation. O'Reilly later defended Miller's use of short-pitched deliveries, pointing out that his field settings were less intimidatory than those of Bodyline.

After a rest day on the Sunday of the game, England resumed on Monday with England still 223 runs in arrears. The <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a> secretary H. A. Brown broadcast an appeal to the spectators via the public address system, urging them to refrain from barracking Miller. In response, they clapped when the Australians took to the field. The chairman of Nottinghamshire reportedly apologised to Bradman in private regarding the crowd reaction to Miller. Taking the new ball in the fifth over of the day, in the overcast conditions that morning, Miller bowled a relatively full length, rather than bouncers, and swung the ball; one of his deliveries beat Hutton and narrowly missed his stumps. Shortly after a break for bad light, he bowled Hutton with an <a href="off%20cutter">off cutter</a>. This brought in Hardstaff, who was dropped from his third delivery by <a href="Arthur%20Morris">Arthur Morris</a> at slip. In the remainder of the over, Hardstaff played and missed, then edged two further balls; the second edge went for four runs through the slips. During the morning session, Bradman used Miller for 11 overs in a row to pressurise the Englishmen.

Another catch went down off Miller late in the day when Compton, who had reached a century, edged him but Johnson dropped the catch at slip. <a href="Charlie%20Barnett%20%28cricketer%29">Charlie Barnett</a> then edged Johnston into the slips, where Miller completed a difficult catch. Compton then hit Miller for four, provoking the paceman's first bouncer of the day. Compton hooked it away for two and the next delivery slipped out of Miller's hand and cleared the batsman's head on the full, provoking some jeering in the crowd. England reached stumps at 6/345, just one run ahead of the tourists, with Compton on 154.

The next day, Compton was out <a href="hit%20wicket">hit wicket</a> for 184 when he tried unsuccessfully to avoid a bouncer from Miller. Fingleton described the dismissal as "a most depressing end to an innings that will live always". Australia quickly finished off the hosts' innings; Miller bowled Laker for four, before England reached 441, leaving Australia with a victory target of 98 in three hours. Miller ended with 4/125 for the innings and 7/163 for the match, having removed England's two leading batsmen in both innings and bowled 63 overs—more than his usual workload—because Lindwall was injured. As the players were walking back to the pavilion after England's innings, Miller received another hostile reception. One spectator threatened him with violence, prompting the Australian to grab him by his coat collar, challenging him to enter the Australian dressing room. The spectator declined. Miller was not required to bat as Australia went on to win by eight wickets.

After the heavy bowling workload at Trent Bridge, Bradman rested Miller for the innings win against <a href="Northamptonshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Northamptonshire</a>, which started the day after the Test. Miller returned for another match against Yorkshire, albeit with a lighter bowling load. He scored 20 in the first innings and made a duck in the second. Nevertheless, he opened the bowling in the first innings with the intention of keeping the pressure on Hutton, although he did not dismiss him in this game. The paceman was barracked by the spectators, who shouted "What about <a href="Harold%20Larwood">Larwood</a>" in response to the repeated short-pitched bowling during his six wicketless overs. Bradman spared Miller from bowling in the second innings because of a back complaint, attempting to preserve him for the Second Test.

The Second Test match was held at Lord's, but Miller was still unable to bowl when it began. He came in to bat in the first innings with Australia at 3/166 on the first afternoon after electing to bat. Bedser bowled three consecutive <a href="outswinger">outswinger</a>s; the fourth ball <a href="inswinger">swung the other way</a>, and Miller was hit on the pads not offering a shot, believing that the ball would have curved away past the stumps. The umpire upheld England's appeal for <a href="leg%20before%20wicket">leg before wicket</a> (lbw) and Miller was out for four. O'Reilly blamed Miller's poor form with the bat on an excessive bowling workload imposed on him by Bradman. Australia made 350, but suffered a blow when Lindwall's injury flared up in the first over; Lindwall played on through the pain. Bradman threw Miller the ball, hoping that the all rounder would reverse his decision not to bowl and take inspiration from Lindwall. The injured bowler returned the ball, citing his back. His gesture generated news headlines among journalists who believed that he had disobeyed Bradman.

Although Bradman claimed that the exchange had been amicable, others disputed this. Teammate Barnes later claimed that Miller had responded to Bradman that he—a very occasional slower bowler—bowl himself. Barnes said that the captain "was as wild as a battery-stung brumby" and warned his unwilling bowler that there would be consequences for his defiance. In unpublished writings in his personal collection, Fingleton recorded that Bradman chastised his players in the dressing room at the end of the play, saying "I'm 40 and I can do my full day's work in the field." According to Fingleton, Miller snapped in reply: "So would I—if I had <a href="fibrositis">fibrositis</a>".

England fell to 4/46 after Lindwall and Johnston's new ball burst, but Compton and Yardley fought back to take the score to 133 without further loss. Compton edged Johnston into the slips, where Miller took a low catch, dismissing the batsman for 53. Soon after, Johnston removed Evans for nine, caught by a diving Miller after lashing out at a wide ball outside off stump to leave the hosts at 7/145.

Australia bowled England out for 215 at the beginning of the third day to take a 135-run first innings lead. This had increased to 431 when Miller came to the crease with the score at 3/296 during the afternoon. English captain Yardley was on a <a href="hat-trick%23Cricket">hat-trick</a>, having removed Hassett first ball after the fall of Barnes. Miller survived a loud lbw appeal on the hat-trick ball before hitting a six into the grandstand and reaching stumps on 22, with Australia at 4/329. He resumed on the fourth morning and reached lunch on 63 with the tourists at 4/409. Miller was reprieved when <a href="Tom%20Dollery">Tom Dollery</a> dropped a catch from a ball he skied into the air. When the new ball was taken, and Miller hit three boundaries to pass 50, to lift the run rate. Miller repeatedly hooked Coxon and drove Bedser for many runs. After lunch, he hit out at every opportunity before the declaration. He was out for 74, playing a hook shot that was caught by Bedser at square leg from the bowling of Laker. Australia declared at 7/460 to set England a target of 596.

England reached 3/106 by stumps on the fourth day, but the final day started poorly when Compton edged the second ball of the day—bowled by Johnston—to a diving Miller at second slip; he knocked the ball upwards before falling on his back and completing the catch as the ball went down. Just as in the first innings, Compton’s dismissal precipitated a collapse, and Australia dismissed England for 186 to complete victory by 409 runs.

After the end of the Lord's Test, Miller attended a concert and party, before returning to the team hotel after dawn the next morning, just before breakfast. Bradman noticed this and addressed him as "Keith", rather than his nickname "Nugget". Australia was due to play Surrey at The Oval on the same day. Bradman won the toss and elected to field. Instead of deploying him to his usual slips position, the Australian skipper sent Miller to field on the <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">fine leg boundary</a> as a punishment for his late night out. Between overs, the banished player had to walk to the opposite end of the ground to be in position for the bowler from the other end. One of the spectators felt sorry for him and lent his bicycle, which the Australian used to cycle around the edge of the ground between overs. Soon after, Bradman brought his all rounder into a fielding position closer to the centre. Miller eventually scored nine in his only innings and was asked to bowl just one over in the second innings, as Australia completed victory by ten wickets. He had a quiet period on the field during July; his cricket generated fewer media stories than his celebrity appearances at social functions and classical music concerts during this time. The match against Surrey was immediately followed by a match against <a href="Gloucestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Gloucestershire</a> in <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a>, where Miller scored 51, featuring in a partnership of 136 with Morris (290). Australia piled on 7/774 declared, its largest score of the season, before proceeding to victory by an innings and 363 runs. Acting captain Hassett allowed Miller to rest and he did not bowl during the match.

The England selectors dropped Hutton for the third Test, held at <a href="Old%20Trafford%20%28cricket%20ground%29">Old Trafford</a>, largely because of his struggles against Miller and Lindwall. The Australians considered this a blunder, as they rated Hutton to be England's best batsman.

Miller had a quiet match. He did not bowl in the first innings as England batted first and posted 363. The closest he came to a catch was when Yardley edged to him in slips on the <a href="half-volley">half-volley</a>. When Australia batted, he came to the crease and joined Morris with the score at 3/82 and the pair took the score to 3/126 at stumps on the second day. He was on 23 and Morris had made 48. The run rate picked up in the last 50 minutes of the day as the pair added 44 runs; Miller was the more attacking of the Australian duo during this time. The next day, Australia struggled against the new ball in the first hour. Miller was beaten three times in one Bedser over before <a href="Dick%20Pollard">Dick Pollard</a> trapped him for 31, prompting a middle-order collapse of 3/37, before the tourists recovered to end at 221, avoiding the follow on by eight runs.

Miller returned to the bowling crease in England's second innings. He immediately broke through Washbrook's defences, only to see the ball graze the stumps without dislodging the <a href="bail%20%28cricket%29">bails</a>. After two Miller outswingers had evaded the outside edge of Washbrook, the batsman appeared unsettled. One bouncer was hit over square leg in an uncontrolled manner for a four, and another flew in the air, narrowly evading Loxton at fine leg. However, Miller did not take a wicket and ended with 0/15 from 14 overs, but again caught Compton. Not for the first time during the season, the Australian paceman riled the crowd when he launched a series of short-pitched balls at Edrich, apparently in retaliation for the Englishman's bouncing of Lindwall. The paceman struck Edrich on the body before Bradman intervened and ordered him to stop his short-pitched barrage. In another incident, Miller was playing <a href="poker">poker</a> with the Englishmen during a rain delay. When the weather cleared, Hassett beckoned him to return to the field for the resumption. Miller ignored him and the poker match continued against the English players who were not currently batting. He won the pot and pocketed the money, before hurriedly running onto the ground late. When he was on the field and approaching the centre, Miller pulled the money out of his pockets. He brandished the notes to the crowd and taunted his English colleagues. The match ended in a draw after the entire fourth day and half of the fifth day was washed out. England declared upon the resumption of play on the final day and set Australia a target of 317 for victory. The tourists reached 1/92 to ensure a draw.

Between Tests, Australia had one tour match against <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesex</a> at Lord's. Bradman rested Miller as Australia won by ten wickets, giving him an eight-day break between the Tests.

The teams moved to <a href="Headingley%20Stadium%23Headingley%20Carnegie%20Cricket%20Ground">Headingley</a> for the Fourth Test at <a href="Leeds">Leeds</a>. Hutton was recalled and the home team won the toss and batted first. England tallied 496, its highest score of the series. Miller took the last wicket of Yardley to finish with 1/43. Generally unthreatening throughout the innings, he bowled only 17.1 overs; the other frontline bowlers sent down at least 33 each. The innings started badly for Miller. He bowled below his full pace and his opening over yielded three <a href="full%20toss">full toss</a>es. In Miller's first over, Hutton scored the first boundary of the day, driving past mid-off. He felt his legs for muscle strains, and after two overs that O'Reilly described as "very innocuous", Miller was taken off. Nursing fitness concerns, Miller was forced to bowl medium-paced off breaks on the second day as England proceeded to 2/423 and appeared to be in complete control, before losing 8/73. In reply, Australia was struggling at 3/68 on the third morning. <a href="Neil%20Harvey">Neil Harvey</a>—playing his first Ashes Test—joined Miller at the crease. Both had walked out in the same over, as Pollard removed Bradman and Hassett in the space of three balls. Australia was more than 400 behind, and if England were to remove the pair quickly, they would expose Australia's lower order and give themselves an opportunity to win by taking a hefty first innings lead. Harvey asked his senior partner "What’s going on here, eh? Let's get stuck into 'em". The pair launched a counterattack, with Miller taking the lead. He hoisted Laker's first ball over <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">square leg</a> for six. Miller shielded the left-handed Harvey from Laker, as his partner was struggling against the off breaks that were turning away from him, especially one that spun, bounced, and beat his outside edge. The all rounder drilled one <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Drive">off-drive</a> from Laker for four, and after mis-hitting the next to the amusement of the crowd, struck the off spinner flat over his head, almost for six into the sightscreen. This allowed Australia to seize the initiative, and Harvey joined in during the next over. The left-hander hit consecutive boundaries against Laker, the second of which almost cleared the playing area. He followed this with another boundary to reach 44. Miller then lifted Laker for a six over <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">long off</a>, hitting a spectator in the head, and another over <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">long on</a> from Yardley's bowling to move from 42 to 54. He drove the next ball through <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">cover</a> for four. Yardley responded by stacking his <a href="leg%20side">leg side</a> with outfielders and <a href="leg%20theory">bowling outside leg stump</a>, challenging Miller to another hit for six. The batsman attempted to oblige, but insteadedged the ball onto wicket-keeper Evans' head; Edrich dived forward and caught the ball on the rebound at <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">short fine leg</a>. The crowd was in raptures at both the batting and Edrich's catch.

The partnership had yielded 121 runs in only 90 minutes, and "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden</a>" likened it to a "hurricane". Cricket commentator <a href="John%20Arlott">John Arlott</a> described the innings as the most memorable that he had witnessed. He said "Miller played like an emperor...Every stroke would have been memorable but each one had bettered its predecessor", saying that his batting had raised cricket "to a point of aesthetic beauty". Fingleton said that he had never "known a more enjoyable hour" of "delectable cricket". He acclaimed Miller's innings as "one of the rarest gems in the Test collection of all time" and "a moment to live in the cricket memory". O'Reilly said that Miller and Harvey had counter-attacked with "such joyful abandon that it would have been difficult, if not absolutely impossible, to gather from their methods of going about it that they were actually retrieving a tremendously difficult situation".

The momentum swung in Australia's favour. Harvey scored 112, while Loxton made 93, hitting a further five sixes from Laker. Lindwall added 77 late in the afternoon as Australia finished at 9/457 on the fourth day, having added 394 in one day's play. At the start of the second innings, Miller bowled a tight opening spell and the English openers scored only five from his six overs as they tried to establish a solid start. Miller took 1/53 in the second innings, removing Bedser and catching Compton yet again as Australia was set a world record chase of 404 on the final day in just 345 minutes. A 301-run second wicket partnership between Morris and Bradman set up the run-chase and Miller came in with the score at 2/358. He made only 12 but Australia won by seven wickets to set a new world record and take a 3–0 series lead.

The day after the Test, the Australians moved onto their next match against <a href="Derbyshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Derbyshire</a>, where Miller scored 57 and took 3/31 in the first innings but bowled only two overs as Australia won by an innings. In a rain-affected draw against <a href="Glamorgan%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Glamorgan</a>, Miller took 2/41 in the hosts' first innings of 197 before compiling a hard-hitting 84. Coming in to join Hassett with the score at 2/67, he struck five sixes and seven fours. He hit one of the sixes with one hand, sending it 20 rows into the crowd. Miller also attacked the Glamorgan captain <a href="Wilf%20Wooller">Wilf Wooller</a>, hitting him over the sightscreen with straight drives from consecutive balls and lofting a third six over long off. He was finally dismissed while attempting another six; Australia's first innings was washed out at 3/215.

Miller was rested for the nine-wicket win against <a href="Warwickshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Warwickshire</a>. He returned against Lancashire. On the final day, Lancashire batsman <a href="Jack%20Ikin">Jack Ikin</a> had reached 99 after being repeatedly hit by bouncers. Bradman took the new ball and gave it to Miller, who refused to bowl, saying that he felt Ikin deserved a century. The Australian skipper gave the ball to Lindwall, who promptly removed Ikin for 99. Miller had a light workload for the match, scoring 24 and 11, and taking a total of 1/32 from 16 overs. In the next game, he came in with Australia in difficulty at 5/133, and scored 55 in faster than even time against <a href="Durham%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Durham</a> in the last match before the Fifth Test. The match was a two-day fixture that was not given first-class status. Miller took 1/17 as the hosts fell to 5/73 in reply to Australia's 282 when rain ended the match at the end of the opening day.

The teams proceeded to The Oval for the Fifth Test. England elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Dewes and Hutton opened for England. Dewes took a single from Lindwall's opening over and thus faced the start of the second over, which was bowled by Miller, who had troubled him in the past and dismissed him several times. During his short innings, Dewes was visibly nervous and kept on moving around, unable to stand still. Miller caused a stoppage after his first ball to sprinkle sawdust on the slippery and damp crease. With his second ball, he bowled Dewes—who was playing across the line—middle stump for one with an inswinger to leave England at 1/2. He then removed <a href="Jack%20Crapp">Jack Crapp</a> caught behind from an outside edge for a 23-ball duck, leaving England at 4/23 as play was adjourned for lunch. The paceman ended with 2/5 from eight overs; Lindwall took 6/20 and England were all out for 52. In his last Test innings for the summer, Miller scored five before overbalancing and being <a href="Stumping%23Manner%20of%20dismissing%20a%20batsman">stumped</a>. Australia made 389 and led by 337 on the first innings on the second afternoon. Bowling for the second time, Miller struck Crapp in the head with a bouncer, before bowling him for nine. He then extracted an edge from Hutton—who fell for 64, having top-scored in both innings—to wicket-keeper Tallon, leaving England at 4/153. Miller ended with 2/22 as Australia won by an innings and took a 4–0 series win.

Seven matches remained after the Test series was concluded. Miller was rested for the innings victory over <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent</a>, but played against the <a href="History%20of%20English%20amateur%20cricket%23Amateurism%20in%20cricket">Gentlemen of England</a> at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a> against an amateur team with many Test players. He scored 69, putting on 157 with Hassett, before being dismissed after attempting a third consecutive <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Pull%20and%20hook">hooked</a> boundary. Australia declared at 5/610 and Miller took a match total of 3/76 in another innings victory, including the wickets of Yardley and <a href="Martin%20Donnelly%20%28cricketer%29">Martin Donnelly</a>. In the following match against <a href="Somerset%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Somerset</a>, Miller had a light workload, scoring an unbeaten 37 at No. 8 as Australia made 5/560 declared, and then bowling only eight overs and taking one wicket as Australia claimed victory by an innings and 374 runs after bowling out the hosts for 115 and 71. He was rested from the match against <a href="South%20of%20England%20cricket%20team">South of England</a>, which ended in a rain-affected draw.

Australia's biggest challenge after the Test series came against the <a href="H.%20D.%20G.%20Leveson-Gower">Leveson Gower's</a> XI. During the last Australian tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England eleven; for this tour, Bradman insisted that no more than six current Test players be allowed to represent for the hosts. The Australian skipper then fielded a full-strength team. Miller returned for this match, held at <a href="Scarborough%2C%20North%20Yorkshire">Scarborough</a>, but did little, scoring one in his only innings and bowling eight overs without success in a match that ended in a rain-affected draw.

This left only two non-first-class matches against <a href="Scotland%20national%20cricket%20team">Scotland</a> to complete the tour. Miller played in the first game and scored six in his only innings and did not take a wicket, before being rested for the second match. Australia won both matches by an innings. As a result, Australia finished the tour with 25 wins and nine draws. They had gone through the summer without defeat.

When asked about the three most beautiful things in England, Miller said "The hills of <a href="Derbyshire">Derbyshire</a>, the <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Sweep">leg sweep</a> of Denis Compton and <a href="Princess%20Margaret">Princess Margaret</a>". Having already gained a high profile in England during the Victory Tests of 1945 and possessing good looks, he was a popular celebrity throughout the country. In 1948, he was sought out for many social functions, such as at music or theatrical performances, and at dinner receptions with members of the Royal Family, <a href="House%20of%20Lords">peerage</a> and political leaders. His friendship with Princess Margaret—the second daughter of <a href="King%20George%20VI">King George VI</a>—was the subject of widespread media speculation as to whether a romantic liaison was involved.

During the tour, Miller generally played in the Tests as an opening bowler alongside Lindwall and as a middle-order batsman, coming in at No. 4 or No. 5. His batting ability was such that he played as a specialist batsman even when he was unable to bowl due to injury, such as during the Second Test. Miller wanted to play purely as a batsman, feeling that the workload of bowling would hinder his run-scoring. However, Bradman was intent on going through the tour undefeated, and utilised his bowling options to the full, to maximise the Australians’ chances of winning. Lindwall and Miller were the first-choice pace duo, regarded as one of the greatest speed pairings in the history of cricket, whereas the latter was just one of many accomplished batsmen in the team. As a result, the Australian skipper valued Miller more as an opening bowler. He ended the Tests with 184 runs at 26.28 and 13 wickets at 23.15 from 138.1 overs and took eight catches.

During the Tests, Miller usually batted at No. 5, except in the Fourth Test when he batted at No. 4 due to the injury-enforced absence of opener Barnes, which resulted in a reshuffle in the batting order. Miller totalled 1,088 first-class runs for the tour, the seventh highest aggregate, although his average of 47.30 was only the eighth highest in the squad. During the tour matches, he batted in a variety of positions, as did all of the squad, because Bradman used a rotation system to rest his team because many matches were played consecutively.

When fit, Miller opened the Test bowling with Lindwall, and the pair bowled in short and fiery bursts with the new ball. The English cricket authorities had agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs. The pre-existing rule stipulated that a replacement ball would be available every 200 runs, which usually took much more time to accumulate. This played directly into the hands of the Australians with their vastly stronger pace attack, as a new ball is ideal for fast bowling. Bradman thus wanted to preserve his two first-choice bowlers for a fresh attack every 55 overs. With 13 wickets in the Tests, Miller was third among the Australians behind Lindwall and Johnston, who took 27 apiece. Owing to his fragility, Miller was used sparingly compared to the other four Australian frontline bowlers: Toshack and Johnson each delivered more than 170 overs despite playing in one less Test, while Lindwall bowled 224 and Johnston 306 in five matches. In all first-class matches, Miller took 56 wickets at 17.58 and held onto 20 catches. There were many consecutive matches during the tour with no intervening rest day, so Bradman ensured that his leading pace duo remained fresh for the new ball bursts in the Tests by giving them a smaller proportion of the bowling during the tour matches. During all first-class matches, Johnston bowled 851.1 overs, Johnson 668, Lindwall 573.4 and Toshack 502, while Miller bowled only 429.4 overs. <a href="Doug%20Ring">Doug Ring</a>—who was only selected in one Test—bowled 542.4 overs, while <a href="all%20rounder">all rounder</a>s <a href="Colin%20McCool">Colin McCool</a> and Loxton bowled 399.4 and 361.2 overs respectively. McCool did not play in any Tests, while Loxton was only entrusted with 63 overs against England. As such, in some tour matches, Miller was not asked to bowl at all, in order to keep him fresh for the Tests.

After the tour, Bradman was full of praise for Miller, although somewhat critical of his aggressive batting, which the Australian captain thought to be reckless: Bradman criticised Miller's hitting of sixes (26), feeling that his mercurial all rounder lacked restraint and concentration. In contrast, Fingleton praised Miller's attitude to cricket, saying "He is never one to accept runs when they are there for the taking ... I acknowledge myself the supreme believer in Miller as a cricketer. He had given me joy in the game approached by others." With respect to his persistent bouncing of Hutton and Compton, Fingleton said that it was up to England to develop bowlers of express pace—which they lacked at the time—to retaliate against or deter the Australians from pursuing such tactics. Miller's persistent disagreements with Bradman soon caught up with him, despite the latter's retirement after the tour. During Bradman's testimonial match, Miller bowled three consecutive bouncers at his retired captain, dismissing him with the last of these and drawing an angry look. Bradman was one of three members of the national selection panel, and Miller was dropped for the next series against South Africa in 1949–50. Although Bradman denied voting for the omission, most of the players in the team did not believe this.

Ficus obliqua, commonly known as the small-leaved fig, is a tree in the family <a href="Moraceae">Moraceae</a>, native to eastern Australia, New Guinea, eastern Indonesia to <a href="Sulawesi">Sulawesi</a> and islands in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. Previously known for many years as Ficus eugenioides, it is a <a href="banyan">banyan</a> of the genus "<a href="Ficus">Ficus</a>", which contains around 750 species worldwide in warm climates, including the <a href="common%20fig">edible fig</a> ("Ficus carica"). Beginning life as a seedling, which grows on other plants (<a href="epiphyte">epiphyte</a>) or on rocks (<a href="lithophyte">lithophyte</a>), "F. obliqua" can grow to high and nearly as wide with a pale grey <a href="buttress%20root">buttressed</a> trunk, and glossy green leaves.

The small round yellow fruit ripen and turn red at any time of year, although they peak in autumn and winter (April to July). Known as a <a href="syconium">syconium</a>, the fruit is an inverted <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a> with the flowers lining an internal cavity. "Ficus obliqua" is pollinated by two species of <a href="fig%20wasp">fig wasp</a>—"<a href="Pleistodontes%20greenwoodi">Pleistodontes greenwoodi</a>" and "<a href="Pleistodontes%20xanthocephalus">P. xanthocephalus</a>". Many species of bird, including pigeons, parrots and various <a href="passerine">passerine</a>s, eat the fruit. The range is along the east coast from <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>, through <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> in <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a>, <a href="savanna">savanna</a> woodland, <a href="sclerophyll%20forest">sclerophyll forest</a> and <a href="gallery%20forest">gallery forest</a>. It is used as a shade tree in parks and public spaces, and is well-suited for use as an <a href="Houseplant">indoor plant</a> or in <a href="bonsai">bonsai</a>. All parts of the tree have been used in traditional medicine in Fiji.

Commonly known as the small-leaved fig, "Ficus obliqua" was <a href="Species%20description">described</a> by German naturalist <a href="Georg%20Forster">Georg Forster</a> in 1786 based on <a href="type%20%28biology%29">type</a> material collected in Vanuatu. Dutch botanist <a href="Friedrich%20Anton%20Wilhelm%20Miquel">Friedrich Miquel</a> described "Urostigma eugenioides" from <a href="Albany%20Island">Albany Island</a> in Queensland in 1861, which was reclassified by <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victorian</a> Government Botanist <a href="Ferdinand%20von%20Mueller">Ferdinand von Mueller</a> as "Ficus eugenioides" in 1867, and it was known as this for many years. However, as Forster's name is older, it takes precedence. The specific epithet is the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> adjective "obliquus", meaning "oblique", although the attribute it refers to is unclear. <a href="Frederick%20Manson%20Bailey">Frederick Manson Bailey</a> described "Ficus tryonii" in 1906, from a collection at altitude on Middle Percy Island in the <a href="Whitsunday%20Islands">Whitsunday Islands</a> off central Queensland, which is now regarded as "F. obliqua". <a href="Joseph%20Banks">Joseph Banks</a> and <a href="Daniel%20Solander">Daniel Solander</a> collected and named "Ficus virginea" from <a href="Booby%20Island%20%28Queensland%29">Booby Island</a> in 1770, which was synonymised with "F. obliqua" by <a href="William%20Philip%20Hiern">William Philip Hiern</a> in 1901.

The species is currently regarded as <a href="Monotypic%20taxon">monotypic</a>. Three <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">varieties</a> of "Ficus obliqua" were recognised until 2001—"F. obliqua" var. "petiolaris", "F. obliqua" var. "obliqua", and "F. obliqua" var. "puberula" from <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>. A revision of the group led to the conclusion that "F. obliqua" var. "petiolaris" belonged in the species "<a href="Ficus%20rubiginosa">F. rubiginosa</a>". "F. obliqua" var. "puberula" was found to be more distantly related to "obliqua" than "rubiginosa" and hence has been reclassified as a separate species, "<a href="Ficus%20brachypoda">Ficus brachypoda</a>".

With over 750 species, "<a href="Ficus">Ficus</a>" is one of the largest <a href="angiosperm">angiosperm</a> <a href="genus">genera</a>. Based on <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a>, English botanist <a href="E.%20J.%20H.%20Corner">E. J. H. Corner</a> divided the genus into four <a href="subgenus">subgenera</a>, which was later expanded to six. In this classification, "Ficus obliqua" was placed in <a href="subseries">subseries</a> "Malvanthereae", <a href="series%20%28botany%29">series</a> "Malvanthereae", <a href="section%20%28botany%29">section</a> "Malvanthera" of the <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a> "<a href="Banyan">Urostigma</a>". In his reclassification of the Australian "Malvanthera", Australian botanist Dale J. Dixon altered the delimitations of the series within the section, but left this species in the series "Malvanthereae".

In a study published in 2008, <a href="Nina%20R%C3%B8nsted">Nina Rønsted</a> and colleagues analysed the <a href="Nucleic%20acid%20sequence">DNA sequences</a> from the nuclear ribosomal <a href="Internal%20transcribed%20spacer">internal</a> and <a href="external%20transcribed%20spacer">external transcribed spacer</a>s (ITS and ETS), and the <a href="glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate%20dehydrogenase">glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase</a> (G3pdh) region, in the first molecular analysis of the section "Malvanthera". They found "F. obliqua" to be most closely related to three species of the arid <a href="Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory</a> ("<a href="Ficus%20platypoda">F. platypoda</a>", "<a href="Ficus%20subpuberula">F. subpuberula</a>" and "<a href="Ficus%20lilliputiana">F. lilliputiana</a>") and classified it in a new series "Obliquae" in the subsection "Platypodeae". The species had remained a transitional rainforest species while its relatives radiated into dryer regions.

"Ficus obliqua" is a tree, which may reach in height with a similar <a href="Crown%20%28botany%29">crown</a> width. It has smooth thin grey bark with lighter-coloured <a href="lenticel">lenticel</a>s, and a <a href="Buttress%20root">buttressed</a> trunk, which may reach in diameter. The glossy green leaves are elliptic to oblong in shape and measure long by wide on <a href="petiole%20%28botany%29">petioles</a>. They are <a href="Phyllotaxis">alternately arranged</a> on the stems. Growing in pairs, the round yellow fruit turn orange or orange-red dotted with darker red and reaches a diameter of upon ripening over April to July, although fruit can appear at other times of year. As is the case with all figs, the fruit is an inverted <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a> known as a <a href="syconium">syconium</a>, with tiny flowers arising from the inner surface. "Ficus obliqua" is <a href="plant%20sexuality%23Plant%20population">monoecious</a>—both male and female flowers are produced by the same plant, and in fact in the same fruit. Within any given fruit, female flowers mature several weeks before the male flowers.

Historically, there has been some confusion between "Ficus obliqua" and the related "<a href="Ficus%20rubiginosa">F. rubiginosa</a>". "F. obliqua" can be distinguished by its smaller fruit on shorter stalks and its <a href="wikt%3Aglabrous">glabrous</a> (hairless) leaves; in addition, the petioles have ascending <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a> hairs. Some forms of "F. rubiginosa" have both leaves and petioles glabrous while others have both covered in fine fur. The syconia of "F. obliqua" are smaller, measuring 4.3–11.9 mm long and 4.4–11.0 mm in diameter, compared with 7.4–17.3 mm long and 7.6–17.3 mm diameter for "F. rubiginosa". "Ficus brachypoda" is a lithophytic plant from arid northern and western Australia, with a short petiole and leaf shape aligning it with "Ficus platypoda".

"Ficus obliqua" occurs from <a href="Mount%20Dromedary">Mount Dromedary</a> (36° S) in southern New South Wales northwards along the coast and <a href="Great%20Dividing%20Range">Great Dividing Range</a> to the tip of <a href="Cape%20York%20Peninsula">Cape York Peninsula</a> in north Queensland. Outside Australia it occurs on New Guinea and offshore islands, through eastern Indonesia to <a href="Sulawesi">Sulawesi</a> in the west and east into the southwestern Pacific, where it is found in New Caledonia, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa and Vanuatu. It had been thought to occur in Western Australia, but these collections have been now referred to "Ficus brachypoda". Preferring soils with high nutrient and water content, it occurs on <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> or <a href="latite">latite</a> soils in the Sydney region. The habitat is warm temperate to moist subtropical <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a>. Large specimens can rise above the <a href="Canopy%20%28biology%29">canopy</a> as <a href="Rainforest%23Layers">emergent</a> trees.

The <a href="double-eyed%20fig%20parrot">double-eyed fig parrot</a> ("Cyclopsitta diophthalma") eats the fruit of "Ficus obliqua", steadily depositing fruity detritus on the ground. The <a href="rainbow%20lorikeet">rainbow lorikeet</a> ("Trichoglossus moluccanus") is another parrot that consumes the fruit and disperses the seeds; other Australian bird species include the <a href="southern%20cassowary">southern cassowary</a> ("Casuarius casuarius"), <a href="brown%20cuckoo-dove">brown cuckoo-dove</a> ("Macropygia phasianella"), <a href="rose-crowned%20fruit%20dove">rose-crowned fruit dove</a> ("Ptilinopus regina"), <a href="wompoo%20fruit%20dove">wompoo fruit dove</a> ("P. magnificus"), <a href="wonga%20pigeon">wonga pigeon</a> ("Leucosarcia melanoleuca"), <a href="topknot%20pigeon">topknot pigeon</a> ("Lopholaimus antarcticus"), <a href="silvereye">silvereye</a> ("Zosterops lateralis"), <a href="pied%20currawong">pied currawong</a> ("Strepera graculina"), <a href="black-faced%20cuckoo-shrike">black-faced cuckoo-shrike</a> ("Coracina novaehollandae"), <a href="olive-backed%20oriole">olive-backed oriole</a> ("Oriolus sagittatus"), <a href="Australasian%20figbird">Australasian figbird</a> ("Sphecotheres vieilloti"), <a href="green%20catbird">green catbird</a> ("Ailuroedus crassirostris"), <a href="regent%20bowerbird">regent bowerbird</a> ("Sericulus chrysocephalus"), <a href="satin%20bowerbird">satin bowerbird</a> ("Ptilonorhynchus violaceus"), and <a href="Lewin%27s%20honeyeater">Lewin's honeyeater</a> ("Meliphaga lewinii"). The tree is an important food source for the western Polynesian species the <a href="many-colored%20fruit%20dove">many-colored fruit dove</a> ("Ptilinopus perousii") and <a href="crimson-crowned%20fruit%20dove">crimson-crowned fruit dove</a> ("P. porphyraceus"), and has been recommended for amenity planting in Tonga for these birds. The <a href="spectacled%20flying%20fox">spectacled flying fox</a> ("Pteropus conspicillatus") and <a href="grey-headed%20flying%20fox">grey-headed flying fox</a> ("Pteropus poliocephalus") also eat the fruit.

Leaves of "Ficus obliqua" serve as a food source for the larvae of the <a href="butterfly">butterfly</a> species the common crow ("<a href="Euploea%20core">Euploea core</a>"), the no-brand crow ("<a href="Euploea%20alcathoe">Euploea alcathoe</a>"), and the <a href="Geometer%20moth">Geometer moth</a> species "<a href="Scopula%20epigypsa">Scopula epigypsa</a>". The <a href="thrips">thrips</a> species "<a href="Gynaikothrips%20australis">Gynaikothrips australis</a>" feeds on the underside of new leaves of "F. obliqua", as well as "F. rubiginosa" and "F. macrophylla". As plant cells die, nearby cells are induced into forming <a href="meristem">meristem</a> tissue. A <a href="gall">gall</a> results and the leaves become distorted and curl over. The thrips remain in the galls at night and wander about in the daytime before returning in the evening, possibly to different galls about the tree. The thrips begin feeding when the tree has flushes of new growth, and the life cycle is around six weeks. At other times, thrips reside on old leaves without feeding or pupate sheltered in the bark.

Figs have an obligate <a href="Mutualism%20%28biology%29">mutualism</a> with <a href="fig%20wasp">fig wasp</a>s (Agaonidae); figs are only pollinated by fig wasps, and fig wasps can only reproduce in fig flowers. Generally, each fig species depends on a single species of wasp for pollination. The wasps are similarly dependent on their fig species to reproduce. The assumption that fig species are usually pollinated by just one species of fig wasp has been challenged by the discovery of <a href="cryptic%20species%20complex">cryptic species complex</a>es among what was previously thought to be single species of fig wasps. "Ficus obliqua" is pollinated by two species of fig wasp—"<a href="Pleistodontes%20greenwoodi">Pleistodontes greenwoodi</a>" and "<a href="Pleistodontes%20xanthocephalus">P. xanthocephalus</a>".

Female and male flowers in each syconium mature at different times. Female wasps enter the syconium and lay eggs in the female flowers as they mature. These eggs later hatch and the progeny mate. The females of the new generation collect pollen from the male flowers, which have matured by this point, and leave to visit other syconia and repeat the process. A field study in <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> found that "F. obliqua" trees often bore both male and female syconia at the same time—this could be beneficial for reproduction in isolated populations, such as those on islands. The same study found a slightly reduced number of male phase syconia in winter, thought due to increased mortality of the wasp pollinator in cooler months.

The animals that eat the figs disperse the seeds, which then germinate and grow on other plants (<a href="epiphyte">epiphyte</a>s) or on rocks (<a href="lithophyte">lithophyte</a>s). As the new plants develop, they send roots to the forest floor. Figs growing on other plants grow larger and larger until they <a href="strangler%20fig">strangle</a> their hosts. "Ficus obliqua" is long-lived, and trees are thought to live in excess of 500 years.

"Ficus obliqua" is an elegant <a href="shade%20tree">shade tree</a> for parks or fields, and is adaptable to differing soils. A notable specimen in Mick Ryan Park, <a href="Milton%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Milton</a> on the New South Wales south coast stands tall and across, and is a local landmark. Like other fig species that grow into large trees, "Ficus obliqua" is not suitable for any but the largest gardens as its aggressive root system invades drains and garden beds. Fig trees also drop large quantities of fruit and leaves, leaving a mess underfoot. Although it is much less used in <a href="bonsai">bonsai</a> than "F. rubiginosa", "F. obliqua" is well-suited for use in the medium; its small leaves and trunk's propensity to thicken give it attributes optimal for a tree in height. It is seen in bonsai nurseries mainly in the <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> area, where it is a locally common species, and is very highly regarded by at least one proponent, Bradley Barlow. Barlow entered a specimen from Brisbane to the Bonsai Clubs International competition in 2006, winning a prize. It is also suited for use as an <a href="Houseplant">indoor plant</a> in low-, medium- or brightly lit indoor spaces. The timber is too soft for use in woodworking.

Known as "baka" or "baka ni viti" in <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a>, "Ficus obliqua" has many of its parts used in Fijian traditional medicine, and was previously held to be sacred there. Its white sap has been used for painful or swollen joints and limbs or boils, or diluted with water and drunk to improve breast milk. Liquid extracted from the root bark has been used for headaches or, when diluted, to improve health after childbirth, and the leaves are applied to <a href="Sexually%20transmitted%20disease">venereal</a> <a href="lesion">lesion</a>s. The species has been traditionally used for <a href="boil">boil</a>s in Samoa and Tonga.

Walter Bache

Walter Bache (; 19 June 184226 March 1888) was an English pianist and <a href="conducting">conductor</a> noted for his championing the music of <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Franz Liszt</a> and other music of the <a href="New%20German%20School">New German School</a> in England. He studied privately with Liszt in Italy from 1863 to 1865, one of the few students allowed to do so, and continued to attend Liszt's master classes in <a href="Weimar">Weimar</a>, Germany regularly until 1885, even after embarking on a solo career. This period of study was unparalleled by any other student of Liszt and led to a particularly close bond between Bache and Liszt. After initial hesitation on the part of English music critics because he was a Liszt pupil, Bache was publicly embraced for his keyboard prowess, even as parts of his repertoire were questioned.

Bache's major accomplishment was the establishment of Liszt's music in England, to which he selflessly devoted himself between 1865 and his death in 1888. This was at the height of the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Romantics">War of the Romantics</a>, when conservative and liberal musical factions openly argued about the future of classical music and the merits of the compositions written in their respective schools. Bache featured several of the orchestral and choral works through an annual series of concerts, which he single-handedly funded, organised and promoted. Likewise, he played an annual series of solo recitals that incorporated Liszt's piano music.

Bache's strategy for presenting these works was one of familiarity. He performed two-piano arrangements of Liszt's orchestral works prior to the debuts of the original versions, and performed some of <a href="Symphonic%20poems%20%28Liszt%29">Liszt's symphonic poems</a> shortly after they had been premiered at the <a href="The%20Crystal%20Palace">Crystal Palace</a>. He also provided informative, scholarly program notes, written by leading musical analysts and intimates in the Liszt circle. The English musical press, while generally hostile to the music he presented, noted and appreciated Bache's efforts. Liszt remained grateful; without Bache, he acknowledged, his music might not have gained the foothold that it did.

Bache was born in <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, the second-oldest son of well-known <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarian</a> minister <a href="Samuel%20Bache">Samuel Bache</a>, who ran a private school in conjunction with his wife, Emily Higginson. His older brother, <a href="Francis%20Edward%20Bache">Francis Edward Bache</a>, was a composer and organist, while his sister, <a href="Constance%20Bache">Constance Bache</a>, was a composer, pianist and teacher who would write a joint biography of both brothers under the title "Brother Musicians". He received some rudimentary musical education at his father's school, but remained a carefree, undistinguished and funloving child until he followed in Edward's footsteps. Like Edward, he studied with <a href="Birmingham%20City%20Organist">Birmingham City Organist</a> <a href="James%20Stimpson">James Stimpson</a> and in August 1858, aged 16, he travelled to Germany to attend the <a href="Leipzig%20Conservatory">Leipzig Conservatory</a>. His father was supposed to accompany him to the university, but was detained at the bedside of Edward, who was dying of <a href="tuberculosis">consumption</a>. Undeterred, he made the journey on his own, an early indication of his independence.

In Leipzig, Bache studied piano with <a href="Ignaz%20Moscheles">Ignaz Moscheles</a> and composition with <a href="Carl%20Reinecke">Carl Reinecke</a>. He also became friends with a fellow student, <a href="Arthur%20Sullivan">Arthur Sullivan</a>, who, he wrote, "cannot play well, but ... has written some things which I think show great talent." Another fellow student Bache knew well, though they were not especially close, was <a href="Edvard%20Grieg">Edvard Grieg</a>. While the city was reportedly past the halcyon days it had experienced under <a href="Felix%20Mendelssohn">Mendelssohn</a>, it proved valuable for exposing Bache to artists such as <a href="Pauline%20Viardot">Pauline Viardot</a>, <a href="Giulia%20Grisi">Giulia Grisi</a>, <a href="Joseph%20Joachim">Joseph Joachim</a> and <a href="Henri%20Vieuxtemps">Henri Vieuxtemps</a>, and to the music of <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven</a>, <a href="Vincenzo%20Bellini">Bellini</a>, <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Chopin">Chopin</a>, <a href="Moritz%20Hauptmann">Moritz Hauptmann</a> and Mendelssohn. He applied himself to his piano studies, but by his own admission wasted much time in Leipzig and lacked direction. In "Brother Musicians", Constance quotes "a musician of high standing" who was one of his circle of friends (possibly Sullivan or the pianist Franklin Taylor), who explained, "You see in Leipzig nobody was compelled to work, there being no particular supervision; and there was always plenty to do, in the way of amusement, for the less energetic. As far as my recollection goes Bache was at that time rather given to working by fits and starts, frequently making excellent resolutions, the effect of which did not last many days."

Upon completing his piano studies in December 1861, the 19-year-old Bache travelled to Italy, staying in Milan and Florence with the intent of soaking in Italian culture before returning to England. In Florence he met Jessie Laussot, "who had founded of a flourishing musical society in the city ... and was intimately acquainted with Liszt, <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a>, <a href="Hans%20von%20B%C3%BClow">Hans von Bülow</a> and other leading musicians." While Laussot remained kindly disposed towards Bache, she also quickly summed up his overly easy-going character and decided to help him. She encouraged him to teach harmony as well as piano, then arranged a harmony class that met early in the morning some ways out of town so that he would not oversleep. She eased his way into polite society and also suggested, after hearing him play at several local concerts, that he travel to Rome and seek out Liszt. However, she insisted that he do so without any introduction from her, as she wanted Liszt to judge him solely on his own merits.

Bache arrived in Rome in June 1862. After some initial confusion (Liszt mistook Bache, who was nervous and tongue-tied, for someone wanting to borrow money) Liszt made Bache welcome. Two or three impromptu lessons followed, along with some chamber music appearances, thanks to Liszt's recommendation. Eventually, Liszt suggested that, if Bache were willing to move to Rome the following year, he would take him on as a regular student. Considering this "the greatest possible advantage I could have", Bache wrote to Constance,
I hope I have not exaggerated in talking about Liszt; he won't make me anything wonderful, so that I can come home and set the Thames on fire—not at all, so don't expect it; "but"—his readings or interpretations are greater and higher than anyone else's; if I can spend some time with him and go through a good deal of music with him, I shall pick up at least a great deal of his ideas;... The two or three lessons I had of him this summer showed me what an immensity I might learn.

After a visit to Birmingham, Bache moved to Rome in 1863 and lived there the next two years. While there he received private lessons from Liszt, one of the few pupils thus privileged; most of Liszt's students attended only his master classes. He also heard Liszt play his own music on many occasions in private homes, including a then-rare performance of the <a href="Piano%20Sonata%20%28Liszt%29">Piano Sonata in B minor</a>. Liszt helped him prepare for several public concerts in Rome and encouraged him to learn some difficult pieces that Bache initially felt unable to play; these pieces included Liszt's transcriptions of <a href="Charles%20Gounod">Gounod</a>'s "<a href="Faust%20%28opera%29">Faust</a>" Waltz and <a href="Giacomo%20Meyerbeer">Meyerbeer</a>'s "Patineurs" Waltz from his opera "<a href="Le%20proph%C3%A8te">Le prophète</a>". These lessons, the kindness that Liszt continually showed, and Bache's exposure to Liszt in general, became a life-defining experience. Liszt expected him to work hard and Bache applied himself with a purpose to his keyboard studies. The same "musician of high standing" that Constance quotes about Bache's years in Leipzig also states that "there can be no doubt that it was his friendship with Liszt that he owed that enthusiasm and power of sustained hard work which distinguished him during his career in London, and which was often the astonishment of those who had known him in earlier years."

Bache supported himself as an organist at the <a href="All%20Saints%27%20Church%2C%20Rome">English Church</a>, where the chaplain had previously known Bache's brother Edward. As his reputation as a performer grew, he also came into demand as a teacher. These two activities guaranteed financial security. He also became acquainted with several young gifted musicians, including fellow Liszt pupil <a href="Giovanni%20Sgambati">Giovanni Sgambati</a> and violinist Ettore Pinelli. During this time, Bache began exploring the two-piano repertoire, especially the arrangements of Liszt's <a href="symphonic%20poem">symphonic poem</a> "<a href="Les%20pr%C3%A9ludes%20%28Liszt%29">Les préludes</a>" and <a href="Franz%20Schubert">Schubert</a>'s <a href="Wanderer%20Fantasy">"Wanderer" Fantasy</a>, which he performed with Sgambati in concert. The two-piano arrangements of Liszt's symphonic poems would become an important feature of Bache's concert series once he returned to England. He was also active in chamber music—the works he performed during this time include Chopin's cello sonata, the David-Pinelli Violin Variations, Mendelssohn's D minor piano trio, a piano trio by <a href="Anton%20Rubinstein">Anton Rubinstein</a> and a <a href="Robert%20Schumann">Schumann</a> violin sonata arranged for viola.

Bache's studies with Liszt did not end when he left Italy. He attended Liszt's master classes in <a href="Weimar">Weimar</a>, Germany regularly until 1885. This period of study was unparalleled by any other student of Liszt and led to a particularly close bond between Bache and Liszt. He also sought out his fellow pupil <a href="Hans%20von%20B%C3%BClow">Hans von Bülow</a> for lessons in 1871; the two spent much time together, which resulted in a lifelong friendship. The fact Bache valued Bülow's advice highly is shown by his warning to Jessie Laussot to ""never" again attempt to 'mark, learn and inwardly digest' the [Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue] without getting Bülow's edition of it ... it is splendid—quite equivalent to having had a lesson on it from Liszt".

For Bache, Liszt wrote his concert arrangement of the <a href="Sarabande%20and%20Chaconne%20from%20Handel%27s%20Almira%20%28Liszt%29">Sarabande and Chaconne from Handel's opera "Almira"</a> in 1879.

Before he moved to Rome, in June 1863, Bache returned to Birmingham to raise funds for the erection of a memorial window to his brother Edward. Among these efforts was a performance of <a href="Felix%20Mendelssohn">Mendelssohn</a>'s <a href="oratorio">oratorio</a> "<a href="St.%20Paul%20%28oratorio%29">St. Paul</a>", at which his organ playing was noted, and a solo piano recital which featured a few pieces by Liszt. Critics proved unreceptive to Liszt's music and Bache was advised to program less adventurous works if he wanted his career to succeed. Matters had not improved when Bache settled in London in 1865. The <a href="War%20of%20the%20Romantics">War of the Romantics</a> between musically conservative and liberal factions was in full swing and he found himself branded as "dangerous" for having studied with Liszt. This was vividly illustrated when Bache called upon <a href="James%20William%20Davison">J. W. Davison</a>, then the most powerful music critic in London. Such a call was not unwarranted: Davison had been acquainted with Edward and shared that brother's conservative musical views. Bache related that when he called on Davison and handed in his card, the maid returned and told him, "Please, sir, Mr. Davison says that he is not at home."
Dangerous or not, Bache soon began a lifelong crusade to win popularity for Liszt's works in England. In 1865 he began a series of annual concerts in conjunction with singer <a href="Gustave%20Garcia">Gustave Garcia</a>. They began modestly, in Collard's Rooms, Grosvenor Street. As they increased in popularity, they were relocated to the more spacious Beethoven Rooms in Cavendish Square, then to the <a href="Hanover%20Square%20Rooms">Queen's Concert Rooms</a> in Hanover Square, and finally to <a href="St%20James%27s%20Hall">St James's Hall</a> in Regents Square. At first these concerts were of instrumental and chamber works and piano arrangements. In 1868, they had grown to include choral works, which allowed pieces such as Liszt's "Soldatenlied" and choruses from <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a>'s "<a href="Tannh%C3%A4user%20%28opera%29">Tannhäuser</a>" and "<a href="Lohengrin%20%28opera%29">Lohengrin</a>" to be programmed. By 1871, the concerts had been changed to an orchestral format.

The concerts, which were held in February or March and continued until 1886, became known as the "Walter Bache Annual Concerts." They became fixtures on the London music scene, attracting the attention of the press and of eminent musicians. While some of the press coverage he received was positive, overall Bache faced a continual barrage of opposition and scorn from critics and fellow musicians over the music he presented. The notice printed in the "<a href="The%20Athenaeum%20%28British%20magazine%29">Athenaeum</a>" after the first concert was typical: "On Tuesday, M. Gustave Garcia, one of the best of rising baritones, and Mr. Walter Bache gave a concert in company. We cannot think "Les Préludes", a very difficult duett [sic] by the Abbé Liszt for two pianofortes, worth the labour bestowed on it by a couple of players so skilled as himself and Mr. Dannreuther. It was well received however." Largely through Bache's perseverance, at least some of the public was gradually convinced of the music's worth.

At these concerts, Bache frequently appeared as soloist, accompanist or conductor, but he also engaged other artists in an attempt to show he was not giving the concerts out of self-aggrandizement. Bülow conducted two concerts, <a href="Edward%20Dannreuther">Edward Dannreuther</a> led the orchestra in two concerts. <a href="August%20Manns">August Manns</a>, the conductor of a series of orchestral concerts held at the <a href="The%20Crystal%20Palace">Crystal Palace</a> and an admirer of Liszt's works, led four concerts. The majority of instrumentalists engaged were also members of the Crystal Palace orchestra to ensure the level of performance was as high as possible. Among guest soloists was the noted violinist <a href="August%20Wilhelmj">August Wilhelmj</a>, who played the Bach <a href="Partita%20for%20Violin%20No.%202%20%28Bach%29%23The%20Ciaccona">Chaconne in D minor</a> at one concert.

For these concerts, Bache programmed five of Liszt's <a href="symphonic%20poem">symphonic poem</a>s, the "<a href="Faust%20Symphony">Faust</a>" and <a href="Dante%20Symphony">"Dante"</a> symphonies, the "Thirteenth Psalm" and the "Legend of St. Elisabeth". Works of <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Berlioz</a>, <a href="Robert%20Schumann">Schumann</a> and <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a> were also featured, but Liszt's compositions predominated. While the performances of the "Faust" and "Dante" symphonies were British premieres, the symphonic poems had previously been introduced at the Crystal Palace; nevertheless, Bache felt that offering repeat performances of the symphonic poems was important in making them familiar to audiences. "Les préludes" was performed three times at the Bache concerts, "<a href="Mazeppa%20%28symphonic%20poem%29">Mazeppa</a>", "<a href="Festkl%C3%A4nge%20%28Liszt%29">Festklänge</a>" and "<a href="Orpheus%20%28Liszt%29">Orpheus</a>" each twice and "<a href="Tasso%2C%20Lamento%20e%20Trionfo%20%28Liszt%29">Tasso</a>" once. Part of this strategy of familiarity was the inclusion of the two-piano arrangements of the symphonic poems as a way to prepare audiences for the orchestral versions. Bache had begun this practice with his first concert in 1865, when he and Dannreuther presented the two-piano arrangement of "Les préludes". Another part of this strategy was supplying learned, well-considered and thoroughly detailed essays for program notes. Sometimes Bache wrote them himself; at other times, he relied on prominent theorists such as Carl Weitman and <a href="Frederick%20Niecks">Frederick Niecks</a>. According to musicologist <a href="Alan%20Walker%20%28musicologist%29">Alan Walker</a>, they "are filled with insights that were both new and original for their time, and they are lavishly illustrated with music examples—a sure sign that they were aimed at a sophisticated public and were intended to have a potential life after the concert was over." According to Walker, they still are worth study for Liszt scholars as many of the ideas, while transmitted through members of Liszt's inner circle, probably originated with the composer himself. These notes, along with the inclusion of the two-piano arrangements and what musicologist Michael Allis calls "a thoughtful approach to programming ... all contributed to an aggressive marketing of Liszt's new status as a composer".

The concerts were a considerable financial outlay for Bache, who did not have a regular salary until 1881 and had to sustain himself through teaching. By 1873, he wrote, he had to "decide whether I shall sacrifice myself entirely to the production of Liszt's orchestral and choral works (which after all can never be immortal as Bach, Beethoven and Wagner: here I feel that Bülow is right). Or shall I make my own improvement the object of my life, and not spend a third of my income in one evening." Bülow became concerned enough about the situation to waive his fee after one concert he conducted, and to contribute £50 out of his own pocket. Liszt was also concerned, writing, "For years [Bache] has sacrificed money for the performance of my works in London. Several times I advised him against it, but he answered imperturbably, 'That is my business.'" Whenever Bache was asked about finances for the concerts, he would tell whoever was asking that the cost was "a just recompense" and add that even if Liszt had charged him for his lessons at the same rate as the average village piano teacher, he would still be deeply in his debt.

In addition to the orchestral concerts, Bache gave an annual series of solo recitals on Liszt's birthday, 22 October, between 1872 and 1887. In October 1879, Bache gave his first all-Liszt recital. At some of these recitals, the two-piano arrangements of Liszt's orchestral works were given. The two-piano version of "Mazeppa" was presented in October 1876, two months before the orchestral version was played at the Crystal Palace and four months before Bache presented it at his own orchestral concert. The "Monthly Musical Record" felt "There was ... good reason in introducing [it] as a duet, with a view to familiarizing hearers with it beforehand", and the "Musical Standard" found that presenting the two-piano arrangement was "an immense help to those who wished to form a correct judgment on it at its first orchestral performance ... as it is impossible, with even the best intentions, to estimate correctly the larger works of Liszt after only one hearing."

Liszt remained grateful to Bache and thanked him on several occasions, writing to him, "Without Walter Bache and his long years of self-sacrificing efforts in the propaganda of my works, my visit to London were indeed not to be thought of."

Bache had long cherished the wish of bringing Liszt to London, which Liszt had last visited in 1841 while still a touring virtuoso, and Liszt knew that whatever standing his music had in that city had in large part to do with Bache's efforts. At least in part to repay the debt he felt he owed Bache, Liszt accepted Bache's invitation to attend celebrations in April 1886 to commemorate Liszt's 75th birthday. These celebrations included the foundation of a Liszt piano scholarship at the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Music">Royal Academy of Music</a>, a performance of his oratorio "The Legend of Saint Elizabeth" led by <a href="Alexander%20Mackenzie%20%28composer%29">Alexander Mackenzie</a> in St. James's Hall, an audience with <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> and a public reception in Liszt's honour at the Grosvenor Gallery. Bache was involved in all four of these events, which were highly successful; by popular demand, "Saint Elizabeth" had to be repeated at the Crystal Palace.

In the summer of 1867, Bache and Dannreuther formed "The Working Men's Society," a small association to promote the music of <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a>, Liszt and <a href="Robert%20Schumann">Schumann</a> in England, with <a href="Karl%20Klindworth">Karl Klindworth</a> as an elder statesman for the group. The Society met regularly at one another's homes for the study and discussion of this music. The first study session met in December and consisted of the "Spinning Song" from Wagner's opera "<a href="The%20Flying%20Dutchman%20%28opera%29">The Flying Dutchman</a>", played by Dannreuther in Liszt's piano transcription. At the meeting the next month, the group tackled the first two scenes of "<a href="Das%20Rheingold">Das Rheingold</a>". The meeting which followed featured a reading of "<a href="Die%20Walk%C3%BCre">Die Walküre</a>". Neither of the latter two works had been presented anywhere; their world premieres at the Munich Court Opera were still two years away. Klindworth's special relationship with Wagner ensured that the group had access to the scores. In the July 1869 meeting, Liszt pupil Anna Mehlig played Liszt's First Piano Concerto for the group. Wagner and Liszt were not the only composers discussed—Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, <a href="Adolf%20von%20Henselt">Henselt</a>, <a href="Joachim%20Raff">Raff</a> and Schumann were among the others whose music was featured. However, the main focus of the group remained the music of Wagner.

Bache became a professor of piano at the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Music">Royal Academy of Music</a> in 1881. The foundation of the Liszt Scholarship at that institution in 1886 was mainly due to his efforts. After Bache's death, the name of the scholarship was changed to the Liszt-Bache Scholarship.

Bache died in London in 1888, at the age of 45, after a brief illness. He developed a chill and an ulcerated throat, which "proved too much for his over-worked and highly strung nature." He had otherwise been in good health and had taught his piano students just a couple of days before his death.

From his early concerts, Bache was noted for showing thoughtfulness in his interpretations and an excellent pianistic technique. He was especially noted for the evenness and crispness of his scales and the "great delicacy and refinement of feeling" in his playing. Like Hans von Bülow, he was considered an "intellectual" pianist who gave performances that were well executed. He was also considered to have improved with time, becoming a less mercurial and "fidgety" player and that despite occasional exaggerations in his interpretations, his artistry was beyond question.

While he was not the only pianist in England to play Liszt's works, Bache was significant in that he played works in concert for solo piano, two pianos and piano and orchestra. In addition to the two-piano arrangements of the symphonic poems, the first two piano concertos, the B minor piano sonata and the "Dante" Sonata, Bache played a handful of transcriptions, five of the "<a href="Hungarian%20Rhapsodies">Hungarian Rhapsodies</a>" and a number of smaller-scaled virtuosic works and miniatures which often highlighted "the melodic nature of Liszt's writing". Bache also played a number of works by other composers in his recitals, many of which are unfamiliar today. Grateful for Bülow's assistance in conducting two of his annual concerts, Bache programmed several of the conductor's piano works in his recitals. He also played various works by Mackenzie, Mendelssohn, Mozart, Raff, Silas, Tchaikovsky and Volkmann and more familiar pieces by Bach, Beethoven and Chopin.

Like Bülow, Bache performed works from memory instead of from the printed page, at a time when doing so was a matter of open debate. Also like Bülow, he began giving recitals devoted entirely to the work of one composer. In 1879, he began giving all-Liszt recitals, and in 1883 he experimented with an all-Beethoven recital.

Bache was considered authoritative in the music of Liszt. About his performance of the B minor piano sonata, the "Musical Standard" wrote that Bache had made the work his own, giving the impression that Liszt's interpretation of the piece and Bache's were essentially one. However, while Bache's performances were universally acclaimed, the works he chose to play received a mixed reception. The "Musical Standard" wrote, after a performance of the First Piano Concerto in 1871, that while Bache's playing was excellent, it did nothing to make Liszt's "bizarre" concerto interesting. "<a href="The%20Athenaeum%20%28British%20magazine%29">The Athenaeum</a>" wrote about the same performance that while the concerto was intricate, there was no difficulty in following the work as played by Bache.

Bache received praise for the works of other composers, as well. The "Musical Standard" wrote that he sounded at home with whatever the musical style of the pieces he played. The "Musical World" noted that Bache's playing of Chopin, Raff, Schumann and Weber all showed "true artistic spirit and taste". Bache's playing of Bach was singled out for mention, with the "Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue" "neat and highly finished". Bache was also said to have given a "masterly" performance of the Bach D minor keyboard concerto.

Despite receiving positive reviews for his pianism, Bache's difficulties with the critics on behalf of Liszt's music had a negative backlash on his performing career. He was never invited to play with the Philharmonic Society, even after Liszt personally recommended him as a soloist. After printed inquiries by the "Musical Standard", which openly questioned why Bache's career had not advanced despite his obvious talent, he was invited in 1874 to play at the Crystal Palace. While his playing was lauded, his choice of music (the Liszt arrangement of Weber's "Polonaise Brillante" for piano and orchestra) was derided as astoundingly impudent. He also appeared at concerts led by <a href="Hans%20Richter%20%28conductor%29">Hans Richter</a>, as organist in Liszt's symphonic poem "<a href="Hunnenschlacht%20%28Liszt%29">Die Hunnenschlacht</a>" and as pianist in Beethoven's <a href="Choral%20Fantasy%20%28Beethoven%29">Choral Fantasy</a> and Chopin's <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%202%20%28Chopin%29">Second Piano Concerto</a>.

House of Music

House of Music is the fourth and final <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by American <a href="contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> band <a href="Tony%21%20Toni%21%20Ton%C3%A9%21">Tony! Toni! Toné!</a> It was released on November 19, 1996, by <a href="Mercury%20Records">Mercury Records</a>. It followed the success of the band's 1993 "<a href="Sons%20of%20Soul">Sons of Soul</a>" album and a hiatus marked by the members' individual musical projects.

For "House of Music", Tony! Toni! Toné! regrouped in 1995 and worked at studios in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Oakland, and Sacramento. Bassist and vocalist <a href="Raphael%20Saadiq">Raphael Saadiq</a>, guitarist and vocalist <a href="D%27wayne%20Wiggins">D'wayne Wiggins</a>, and percussionist/keyboardist Timothy Christian Riley worked on songs for the album independently before recording them together as a group. Most of the album was produced by the group; the only song to feature outside production was "<a href="Let%27s%20Get%20Down%20%28Tony%21%20Toni%21%20Ton%C3%A9%21%20song%29">Let's Get Down</a>", by Saadiq and rapper/producer <a href="DJ%20Quik">DJ Quik</a> and G-One.

Tony! Toni! Toné! sought to emphasize musicianship rather than production technique during the sessions. The record expanded on their previous work's traditional R&B influences with live instrumentation and balladry. Music journalists have noted the album's incorporation of traditional and contemporary sensibilities, themes of love and romance, and witty, sensitive lyrics. Tony! Toni! Toné! named "House of Music" after a small <a href="record%20shop">record store</a> in the band's native city of Oakland, which Wiggins said they were reminded of after listening to the album.

The album charted for 31 weeks on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>, peaking at number 32, and was certified <a href="RIAA%20certification">Platinum</a> by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA). It also received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised Tony! Toni! Toné!'s musicianship and songwriting. An international tour promoting "House of Music" was planned but did not materialize amid growing tensions within the group stemming from creative differences. They disbanded shortly after the album's release to pursue separate music careers.

Tony! Toni! Toné! took a hiatus as a group after the commercial and critical success of their third album "<a href="Sons%20of%20Soul">Sons of Soul</a>" (1993). According to vocalist and bassist <a href="Raphael%20Saadiq">Raphael Wiggins</a>, each member had pursued individual music projects, and "the group was trying to figure out where everybody's time, space and head was at." He, <a href="D%27wayne%20Wiggins">D'wayne Wiggins</a>, and Timothy Christian Riley worked on songwriting and production for other recording artists during the band's hiatus, including <a href="D%27Angelo">D'Angelo</a>, <a href="En%20Vogue">En Vogue</a>, <a href="Karyn%20White">Karyn White</a>, <a href="Tevin%20Campbell">Tevin Campbell</a>, and <a href="A%20Tribe%20Called%20Quest">A Tribe Called Quest</a>. Raphael Wiggins adopted the surname "Saadiq" for his professional name in 1994—"man of his word" in Arabic—and released his solo <a href="single%20%28music%29">single</a> "<a href="Ask%20of%20You">Ask of You</a>" in 1995. Their work outside the band led to rumors of a break-up during the time between albums, before regrouping to record "House of Music".

"House of Music" was recorded in sessions that began in September 1995 and took place at the following California-based studios: Brillian Studios and <a href="Hyde%20Street%20Studios">Hyde Street Studios</a> in San Francisco; Coda Studios and Grass Roots Studios in Oakland; Encore Studios, Image Recording, and <a href="Westlake%20Recording%20Studios">Westlake Recording Studios</a> in Los Angeles; and Pookie Labs and Woodshed Studios in Sacramento. 

Tony! Toni! Toné! used vintage recording equipment and, for certain tracks, a 40-piece orchestra. Some songs featured guest musicians, including rapper and producer <a href="DJ%20Quik">DJ Quik</a>, percussionist <a href="Sheila%20E.">Sheila E.</a>, and the <a href="Tower%20of%20Power">Tower of Power</a> horn section. Saadiq worked with DJ Quik on the song "Let's Get Down" and said the collaboration proved very "natural" because of the producer's affinity for <a href="funk">funk</a> music. Tony! Toni! Toné! wanted to record the album with an emphasis on musicianship rather than production flair. Wiggins felt that the absence of their once prominent <a href="synthesizer">synthesizer</a>s made the resulting music sound more distinctive. "On a lot of the songs, you can just imagine a five-piece band performing", he later told "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>".

Unlike the group's previous albums, each member arranged, composed, and produced songs on their own before putting the finished recordings together for "House of Music". According to Saadiq, "what I did was write a lot of stuff and rehearse it for about a month, then recorded it live. Then [Wiggins and Riley] would add their parts separately." He worked with his own recording crew for "House of Music", featuring guitarist <a href="Chalmers%20Alford">Chalmers "Spanky" Alford</a>, drummer Tommy Branford, and keyboardists Kelvin Wooten and Cedric Draper. Wiggins believed the band's hiatus benefited the recording of "House of Music", making them less likely to produce an album derivative of "Sons of Soul".

The album's opening track, the <a href="Al%20Green">Al Green</a>-styled "Thinking of You", was one that the group conceived and recorded together at 3 a.m. in Saadiq's Pookie Labs studio. As he remembered it, "I was just playing around and started singing off the top of my head. I never wrote anything down, it was just what came out." "Annie May", one of Wiggins' songs for "House of Music", had Saadiq's backing vocals pre-recorded and then <a href="overdubbing">overdubbed</a> to the track's final mix. 

Tony! Toni! Toné! completed recording "House of Music" in September 1996. The album was then <a href="audio%20mastering">mastered</a> by <a href="Brian%20Gardner">Brian Gardner</a> at the <a href="Bernie%20Grundman">Bernie Grundman Mastering</a> studio in Hollywood. One of Saadiq's songs for the album, "Me and the Blind Man", was excluded from the final <a href="audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mix</a> because, as Saadiq told "<a href="Yahoo%21%20Music">Yahoo! Music</a>", "they didn't want anybody playing favorites, so one of my songs had to come off." The recording was a moody blues piece with surrealistic lyrics about lust, longing, and a fictitious blind man's secret powers. Saadiq wanted to show "a darker side ... some depth" to listeners with the song. "To me songs like 'Blind Man,' make the whole sound, the "House of Music"", he remarked. It was featured on an album <a href="sampler%20%28record%29">sampler</a> sent by the group's label to music journalists.

"House of Music" expanded on Tony! Toni! Toné!'s previous traditional R&B-influenced work by emphasizing live instrumentation and ballads. In the opinion of "<a href="Daily%20Herald%20%28Arlington%20Heights%29">Daily Herald</a>" writer Dan Kening, the album continued the band's mix of contemporary R&B and old-fashioned soul, deeming it "half a tribute to their '60s and '70s soul music roots and half a masterful blend of modern smooth balladeering and danceable funk." "<a href="Salon.com">Salon</a>" critic Jennie Yabroff believed "House of Music" mostly featured ballads in the form of "slow, emotional numbers with muted beats" that accentuated the lyrics. According to "<a href="Drum%20%28South%20African%20magazine%29">Drum</a>" magazine, mid-tempo songs such as "Thinking of You" and "Still a Man" relied strongly on 1960s R&B/soul "given a contemporary face", while up-tempo songs such as "Lovin' You", "Don't Fall in Love", and "<a href="Let%27s%20Get%20Down%20%28Tony%21%20Toni%21%20Ton%C3%A9%21%20song%29">Let's Get Down</a>" had elements of funk.

The lyrics on "House of Music" were described by several journalists as witty and sensitive. Michaelangelo Matos of the "<a href="Chicago%20Reader">Chicago Reader</a>" characterized Saadiq's songwriting as playful and quirky, while comparing his <a href="tenor">tenor</a> singing voice to that of a young <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>. On Wiggins' songwriting style, Matos said his melodies and rhythms were more subtle than those of Saadiq and observed "burnished obbligatos, hushed burr, and starry-eyed falsetto" in Wiggins' singing. Saadiq alternated with Wiggins as lead vocalist for the album. Richard Torres of "<a href="Newsday">Newsday</a>" attributed the group's lyrics on the album to their "[belief] in the power of <a href="love">love</a> and the lure of <a href="romance%20%28love%29">romance</a>."
According to Saadiq, the opening track "Thinking of You" is "a really soul, southern, funky song" inspired by Al Green. It has light guitar strokes and is sung in a <a href="Southern%20American%20English">Southern twang</a> by Saadiq, while "Top Notch" features <a href="jazz">jazz</a> elements and the vocalist's playful promise of a trip to <a href="Denny%27s">Denny's</a> for "the most expensive dinner we can find". On "Still a Man", he sings from the perspective of a man who was left by his wife to raise their children alone. The backing vocalists sing the meditative <a href="hook%20%28music%29">hook</a>, "Have you ever loved somebody / Who loves you so much it hurts you to hurt them so bad?" On "Holy Smokes & Gee Whiz", Saadiq's older brother Randall Wiggins sings lead. It was described by "<a href="Washington%20City%20Paper">Washington City Paper</a>" journalist Rickey Wright as a modernized version of <a href="the%20Stylistics">the Stylistics</a>' 1972 song "<a href="Betcha%20by%20Golly%2C%20Wow">Betcha by Golly, Wow</a>", featuring "a dead-on impression of <a href="Russell%20Thompkins%2C%20Jr.">Russell Thompkins</a>' unmistakable <a href="falsetto">falsetto</a> and precise diction". 

"Annie May" was written by Wiggins as a story about a "<a href="Girl%20next%20door">good girl next door</a>" who becomes an <a href="Exotic%20dancing">exotic dancer</a>, while "Let Me Know" is a love song with <a href="Wall%20of%20Sound">Wall of Sound</a> elements. According to Nick Krewen of "<a href="The%20Hamilton%20Spectator">The Spectator</a>", "Wild Child" is "a ballad in the grand sense" of the 1977 <a href="Earth%2C%20Wind%20%26amp%3B%20Fire">Earth, Wind & Fire</a> song "Be Ever Wonderful". "Party Don't Cry" is a meditation on mortality with jazzy, philosophical overtones. Wright believed the song "expresses an overt spirituality unheard in the Tonyies' past songs". The closing track is a <a href="gospel%20music">gospel</a>-influenced instrumental and <a href="variation%20%28music%29">variation</a> of "Lovin' You" composed by Saadiq. Its sole lyric, according to Wright, is a universalist platitude.

"House of Music" was named after a <a href="record%20shop">record store</a> in the band's native Oakland, which had closed several years prior to the album's release. In an interview for "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>", Wiggins said, "We title all our albums at the end of the project. We sat back and listened to everything, and it reminded us of this <a href="small%20business">mom-and-pop</a> store around our way in Oakland." "We grew up in a house of music," Wiggins continued, remarking how their father was a blue guitarist and music had a unifying effect on people. According to "Billboard"s Shawnee Smith, the album's title described a varied, complete work distinct from a contemporary music market oversaturated by "retro-soul groups". 

The album's cover and booklet photos were taken by photographer <a href="William%20Claxton%20%28photographer%29">William Claxton</a>, who captured Tony! Toni! Toné! dressed in casual and formal, retro clothing. This departure from the more outré wardrobe of the band's past was interpreted by journalist Brandon Ousley as an effort to promote "the elegance of 1960s-era <a href="African%20Americans">Black America</a> and legendary <a href="soul%20music">soul</a> acts to a modern generation".

"House of Music" was released on November 19, 1996, by <a href="Mercury%20Records">Mercury Records</a>. The label planned the release date to coincide with the peak <a href="Christmas%20and%20holiday%20season">holiday shopping</a> period and ran ad campaigns scheduled for network cable, syndicated television shows, and radio stations. "House of Music" reached number 32 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> and spent 31 weeks on the chart. In its first eight weeks, the album sold 318,502 copies in the US. Tony! Toni! Toné! inaugurated its release with a <a href="virtual%20press%20conference">satellite press conference</a> and in-store performance at a small retail outlet in the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay%20Area">San Francisco Bay Area</a>. They also embarked on a tour of <a href="historically%20black%20colleges%20and%20universities">historically black college</a>s and Black Independent Coalition record shops after "Let's Get Down" had been sent to R&B and <a href="crossover%20%28music%29">crossover</a> radio on October 28 as the album's <a href="lead%20single">lead single</a>; its <a href="music%20video">music video</a> was released to outlets such as <a href="Black%20Entertainment%20Television">BET</a>, <a href="The%20Box%20%28US%20TV%20channel%29">The Box</a>, and <a href="MTV">MTV</a>. Tony! Toni! Toné! performed the song on the sketch comedy show "<a href="All%20That">All That</a>"; on the music variety program "<a href="Soul%20Train">Soul Train</a>", they performed "Let's Get Down" and "Annie May". "Thinking of You" was released as the second single on March 11, 1997, by which time "House of Music" had sold 514,000 copies, according to <a href="Nielsen%20SoundScan">Nielsen SoundScan</a>. On August 6, the album was certified <a href="RIAA%20certification">Platinum</a> by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA).

After "House of Music" was released, Tony! Toni! Toné! experienced growing tensions stemming from creative differences, business-related problems, and Saadiq's interest in a solo career. "There's a quiet stress between us that no one really talks about", Saadiq told "<a href="Vibe%20%28magazine%29">Vibe</a>" in 1997. "And what's sad about the whole thing is the fact that our friendship is disintegrating. Who knows, "House of Music" could be the last Tony Toni Toné album." The band remained committed to promoting the record into 1997, including a February 28 taped performance at <a href="VH1">VH1</a>'s "Hard Rock Live" special. According to Mercury vice president Marty Maidenberg, an international tour for the album had been planned by October 1996, with concert dates in Japan and the United Kingdom, but it never materialized. In November 1997, Saadiq told the "<a href="Philadelphia%20Daily%20News">Philadelphia Daily News</a>" "there should have been like four singles from that album. You'll have to call Mercury on that. It went Platinum with no promotional tour. We did our job and they made their money." The group disbanded shortly afterwards, and each member went on to pursue an individual music career.

Reviewing "House of Music" in "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>", <a href="Ken%20Tucker">Ken Tucker</a> found Tony! Toni! Toné!'s imitations of classic sounds "intelligent, sometimes brilliant", "witty", and "tremendously likable", with "a new recurring theme: what makes a man a man and a woman a woman, explored with both frankness and slyness". Sonia Murray of "<a href="The%20Atlanta%20Journal-Constitution">The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>" hailed it as the band's most effectual and multifaceted record yet, while "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" critic <a href="Greg%20Kot">Greg Kot</a> said "they find rapture that is steeped in reality rather than in the <a href="upward%20mobility">upwardly mobile</a> fantasy concocted by many of today's less tradition-conscious R&B crooners." "The Tonies serve as a sort of stylistic missing link", <a href="J.%20D.%20Considine">J. D. Considine</a> wrote in "<a href="The%20Baltimore%20Sun">The Baltimore Sun</a>", "suggesting what would have happened had the soul styles of the '70s continued to evolve, instead of being tossed aside by the synth-driven sound of the '80s". Michael A. Gonzales from "<a href="Vibe%20%28magazine%29">Vibe</a>" said the album "glows a vision of <a href="African%20American%20culture">blackness</a> that is superbad, mad smooth, and crazy sexy". He described it as "a wonderland of harmonic delights, softcore jollies, and <a href="slow%20jam">slow-jam</a> fever floating on the tip of <a href="Cupid">Cupid</a>'s arrow", showing the group "exploring the sensuality of <a href="African-American%20music">black pop</a> without sounding like boulevard bullies stalking their objects of desire". 

"House of Music" was voted the 30th best album of 1996 in "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>"s <a href="Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop</a> poll, which polled 236 American critics nationwide. <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a>, the poll's supervisor, ranked it 10th on his own year-end list. In his review for the newspaper, he deemed "Thinking of You" a "hilariously gutsy" and spot-on Al Green homage while writing of the album:

In retrospect, Christgau attributed the album's success to Saadiq's lead role in Tony! Toni! Toné! He contended that "only with "House of Music" did they become true sons of the soul revival, the most accomplished r&b act of the '90s. That's still the album to remember them by." <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> editor Leo Stanley later remarked that the group "successfully accomplish their fusion of the traditional and contemporary ... within the framework of memorable, catchy songs" indebted to both old and modern R&B songwriting virtues. According to Stanley, the record had an influence on contemporary <a href="neo%20soul">neo soul</a> artists such as <a href="Tony%20Rich">Tony Rich</a> and <a href="Maxwell%20%28musician%29">Maxwell</a>. In Matos' opinion, the album showcased the increasing artistic contrast between Saadiq and Wiggins, which "had grown so pronounced that the tension only enhanced what was already the group's best batch of songs". Rashod Ollison of "<a href="The%20Virginian-Pilot">The Virginian-Pilot</a>" regarded the record as "a flawless gem" on which the band's "amalgamation of traditional and contemporary styles coalesced beautifully". In "<a href="The%20Rolling%20Stone%20Album%20Guide">The Rolling Stone Album Guide</a>" (2004), Fred Schruers said ""House of Music" consolidates the triumph of "Sons of Soul" for a masterpiece of 1990s R&B, an album that is as steeped in soul tradition as anything by Maxwell or D'Angelo, but that mixes the homage with humor and deft contemporary touches, thereby creating a new space all its own".

Temple Sinai (Oakland, California)

Temple Sinai (officially the First Hebrew Congregation of Oakland) is a <a href="Reform%20Judaism">Reform</a> <a href="synagogue">synagogue</a> located at 2808 Summit Street (28th and Webster Streets) in <a href="Oakland%2C%20California">Oakland, California</a>, United States. Founded in 1875, it is the oldest Jewish congregation in the <a href="East%20Bay%20%28San%20Francisco%20Bay%20Area%29">East San Francisco Bay</a> region.

Its early members included <a href="Gertrude%20Stein">Gertrude Stein</a> and <a href="Judah%20Leon%20Magnes">Judah Leon Magnes</a>, who studied at Temple Sinai's Sabbath school, and <a href="Ray%20Frank">Ray Frank</a>, who taught them. Originally traditional, the temple reformed its beliefs and practices under the leadership of <a href="Rabbi">Rabbi</a> Marcus Friedlander (1893–1915). By 1914, it had become a <a href="Pittsburgh%20Platform">Classical Reform</a> congregation. That year the current sanctuary was built: a <a href="Beaux-Arts%20architecture">Beaux-Arts</a> structure designed by <a href="G.%20Albert%20Lansburgh">G. Albert Lansburgh</a>, which is the oldest synagogue building in Oakland.

The congregation weathered four major financial crises by 1934. From then until 2011, it was led by just three rabbis, William Stern (1934–1965), Samuel Broude (1966–1989), and Steven Chester (1989–2011).

In 2006 Temple Sinai embarked on a $15 million capital campaign to construct an entirely new synagogue campus adjacent to its current sanctuary. <a href="Groundbreaking">Groundbreaking</a> took place in October 2007, and by late 2009 the congregation had raised almost $12 million towards the construction. As of 2015, Temple Sinai had nearly 1,000 member families. The rabbis were <a href="Jacqueline%20Mates-Muchin">Jacqueline Mates-Muchin</a> and <a href="Yoni%20Regev">Yoni Regev</a>, and the <a href="hazzan">cantor</a> was Ilene Keys. The synagogue has two emeritus rabbis, Samuel Broude and Steven Chester.

Founded in 1875 as the First Hebrew Congregation of Oakland, Temple Sinai is the oldest synagogue in the <a href="East%20Bay%20%28San%20Francisco%20Bay%20Area%29">East Bay</a> region of the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay%20Area">San Francisco Bay Area</a>. It grew out of Oakland's Hebrew Benevolent Society, which had been organized in 1862 by eighteen merchants and shopkeepers from several foreign countries—predominantly <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Poland">Polish Jews</a> from <a href="Pozna%C5%84">Poznan</a>. Although Hebrew Benevolent Societies typically ceased operations upon the founding of a synagogue, Oakland's was unusual in continuing to function independently for a number of years (the two groups did not merge until 1881).

By 1876, the congregation had purchased land on the south side of 14th and Webster streets; however, due to a severe <a href="recession">recession</a> in California at the time, the congregation did not construct a building until 1878. The wooden structure, with <a href="Moorish%20Revival%20architecture">Moorish Revival</a> elements and <a href="onion%20domes">onion domes</a>, was completed at a cost of around $8,000 (today $).

<a href="Jewish%20services">Services</a> were initially traditional, following the <a href="Nusach%20Ashkenaz">Polish rite</a>. Men and women sat separately, but the "<a href="mehitza">mehitza</a>" separating them was soon done away with. In 1881 the new president, David Hirschberg, led a campaign to modernize, and convinced a small majority to introduce a number of reforms, including the addition of a mixed choir of Christians and Jews and organ music, and the removal of the requirement for a "<a href="minyan">minyan</a>". Traditionalists—who mostly came from the Hebrew Benevolent Society—objected and withdrew, forming their own <a href="Orthodox%20Judaism">Orthodox</a> "minyan", which eventually became Oakland's Congregation Beth Jacob.

In 1881, the congregation hired Oakland's first <a href="rabbi">rabbi</a>, Meyer Solomon Levy. Born in England in January 1852 and raised there, he was the son of Rabbi Solomon Levy of Borough Synagogue in London. Meyer Solomon Levy had been ordained in England as an Orthodox rabbi before he was twenty, and moved to Australia as a young man. An early supporter of <a href="Zionism">Zionism</a>, he had served as a rabbi in Melbourne before moving to California in 1872 or 1873, where he served as the rabbi of Temple Emanu-El (then Bickur Cholim) in <a href="San%20Jose%2C%20California">San Jose</a>. Levy was paid $100 a month (today $), and <a href="tzedakah">donated</a> a percentage to the poor.

Levy came into conflict with Oakland's public schools, which refused to excuse Jewish students on <a href="High%20Holy%20Days">High Holy Days</a>. He petitioned that they be excused, but the superintendent and district went even further, and directed teachers not to schedule examinations for those days. Although sensitive to the needs of the members, Levy was more observant than his congregants, which also led to conflict. He accepted the reforms of shortening the "<a href="Shabbat">Shabbat</a>" services, and facing the congregation (rather than the <a href="ark%20%28synagogue%29">ark</a>) during prayer, but he successfully resisted attempts to adopt <a href="Isaac%20Mayer%20Wise">Isaac Mayer Wise</a>'s 1885 <a href="Isaac%20Mayer%20Wise%23%26quot%3BMinhag%20America%26quot%3B%20Prayer-Book">""Minhag" America" Prayer-Book</a>.

Although traditional in some ways, Levy was progressive in others. "Deeply affected by the enlightened spirit of his day", according to historian <a href="Fred%20Rosenbaum">Fred Rosenbaum</a>, he "delivered lectures with titles such as 'Progress of Science' and, while at the First Hebrew Congregation, he invited Oakland's <a href="Unitarian%20Universalism">Unitarian</a> minister to give a series of talks at the synagogue. Levy in turn was well received at the Unitarian Church, where he spoke on the theory of <a href="evolution">evolution</a>."

In 1885, the synagogue burned down, although the <a href="Sefer%20Torah">Torah scrolls</a> were saved by a congregant who entered the burning building to retrieve them. Levy made prodigious efforts to raise funds for a new building, traveling as far away as <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>. The synagogue's female members also raised significant funds through a "Grand Fair". Their combined efforts were successful, and by 1886 a new building had been erected at 13th and Clay streets. The structure had "Moorish elements inspired by <a href="Isaac%20M.%20Wise%20Temple">Isaac Mayer Wise's Plum Street Temple</a> in <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>".

The tensions between liberal-minded members and the traditional Levy were never resolved, and in 1891, the rabbi moved to San Francisco's <a href="Congregation%20Beth%20Israel-Judea%23Congregation%20Beth%20Israel">Congregation Beth Israel</a>. That year the women of the congregation formed the Ladies Auxiliary (Temple Sisterhood), whose initial mandate was to assist the work of the synagogue's Sunday school, and increase its enrollment.

During Levy's tenure, the synagogue had several congregants who were famous, or would become so. <a href="Ray%20Frank">Ray Frank</a>, the first Jewish woman to preach formally from a pulpit in the United States, settled in Oakland around 1885, and taught <a href="Tanakh">Hebrew Bible</a> studies and <a href="Jewish%20history">Jewish history</a> at First Hebrew Congregation's Sabbath school, where she was superintendent. Her students there in the 1880s included <a href="Gertrude%20Stein">Gertrude Stein</a>, later to become a famous writer, and <a href="Judah%20Leon%20Magnes">Judah Leon Magnes</a>, who would become a prominent Reform rabbi. Magnes's views of the Jewish people were strongly influenced by First Hebrew's Rabbi Levy, and it was at the building on 13th and Clay that Magnes first began preaching—his <a href="bar%20mitzvah">bar mitzvah</a> speech of 1890 was quoted at length in "<a href="The%20Oakland%20Tribune">The Oakland Tribune</a>".

Morris Sessler succeeded Levy as rabbi in 1892. He had served at Congregation of the Sons of Israel and David in Providence, Rhode Island, from 1887 to 1892. His tenure lasted only six months, as "his ideas did not harmonize with those of the congregation". He became rabbi of Congregation Gates of Prayer in New Orleans that same year, where he served until 1904.

The congregation hired Marcus Friedlander of <a href="Congregation%20Baith%20Israel%20Anshei%20Emes">Congregation Baith Israel</a> in Brooklyn, New York in 1893. Soon after he was hired, California experienced another economic downturn, which hurt the finances of members of the congregation. The congregation sold its property at 13th and Clay (which had become the heart of the business district) in 1895, and moved to a less expensive location at the northwest corner of 12th and Castro streets, and renovated the building there in 1896. Over 500 people, both Jews and non-Jews, were sheltered in the building for days after the <a href="1906%20San%20Francisco%20earthquake">1906 San Francisco earthquake</a>. The synagogue had 95 members by 1907, with annual revenues of $6,000 (today $).

Friedlander and former congregation president Abraham Jonas persuaded the congregation to introduce a number of significant reforms in the service: they first adopted the <a href="Marcus%20Jastrow%23Aids%20Organization%20of%20American%20Jews">Jastrow prayer book</a>, and later the <a href="Reform%20Judaism">Reform</a> movement's "<a href="Union%20Prayer%20Book">Union Prayer Book</a>" (though in a revised, less radical version published specifically for First Hebrew, and authorized by the <a href="Central%20Conference%20of%20American%20Rabbis">Central Conference of American Rabbis</a>). By 1908, the congregation had eliminated the second day of "<a href="Rosh%20Hashanah">Rosh Hashanah</a>", and few men wore <a href="kippah">head coverings</a> in the service, and by 1914 the congregation had moved completely to the radicalism of "<a href="Pittsburgh%20Platform">Classical Reform</a>".

In 1910, First Hebrew bought a lot on <a href="Telegraph%20Avenue">Telegraph Avenue</a> at Sycamore Street, near 26th Street, for $28,000 (today $), and sold its property at 12th and Castro for the same amount. The congregation, however, decided not to build there. In 1912 it found a better location, and purchased its current site at 28th and Webster for $12,050 (today $). <a href="Groundbreaking">Groundbreaking</a> took place on October 26, 1913, and the building was completed there in 1914 at a cost of $100,000 (today $). Fourteen thousand dollars (today $) of the costs were raised by the Ladies Auxiliary, which also purchased a new <a href="Austin%20Organs%2C%20Inc.">Austin pipe organ</a> for the sanctuary at a cost of $5,000 (today $). The new building was called "Temple Sinai", and thereafter the congregation itself became known as "Temple Sinai", although it retained the official name of "First Hebrew Congregation of Oakland".

Designed by noted American architect <a href="G.%20Albert%20Lansburgh">G. Albert Lansburgh</a>, the <a href="Beaux-Arts%20architecture">Beaux-Arts</a> structure had six tall <a href="stained%20glass">stained glass</a> windows, an "elliptical dome", and an entrance characterized by "graceful <a href="Corinthian%20order">Corinthian columns</a> supporting a <a href="Greco-Roman%20world">Greco-Roman</a> <a href="portico">portico</a>". Carved into the <a href="entablature">entablature</a> above the entrance was the <a href="Tanakh">Biblical</a> verse (). More modest in size than most Beaux-Arts buildings, it nevertheless had features typical of that style, including its "cross-axial composition". However, it was adorned with "simpler materials such as <a href="Brick%23Dry%20pressed%20bricks">pressed brick</a> and carved wood", rather than the usual "florid <a href="Neoclassical%20architecture">Classical design elements</a>". Along with the sanctuary, the building included a social hall and classrooms. It is the only example of Lansburgh's work in Oakland, and one of about 150 Oakland buildings given an "A" or "Highest Importance" rating by the Oakland Cultural Heritage Survey, which signifies "outstanding architectural example or extreme historical importance". The building has a status code of "3S" in the California Historical Resource Information System database, indicating that it "appears eligible for the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>" (NRHP).

The outbreak of World War I, and the costs of the new mortgage, placed a significant financial strain on the members, and in 1915 they decided to release Friedlander from his contract. Temple Sinai hired Harvey B. Franklin as rabbi in 1917, but his tenure there was only two years. During his term, the congregational school held classes twice a week, and had 285 students and 8 teachers. Franklin next served at Bickur Cholim in San Jose—the congregation from which Temple Sinai's first rabbi, Myer Solomon Levy, had come.

After going without a rabbi for another two years, in 1921 Temple Sinai hired Rudolph I. Coffee, an Oakland native and cousin of Judah Leon Magnes. Coffee was outspoken, and passionately advocated liberal causes: he supported disarmament, birth control, and <a href="separation%20of%20church%20and%20state">separation of church and state</a>, and opposed <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">prohibition</a>, <a href="antisemitism">antisemitism</a>, and <a href="Tammany%20Hall">Tammany Hall</a>. Along with other local rabbis Jacob Nieto and Jacob Weinstein, he demanded the release of labor leaders and accused bombers <a href="Preparedness%20Day%20Bombing">Thomas Mooney and Warren Billings</a>. He also supported California's <a href="compulsory%20sterilization">compulsory sterilization</a> of the <a href="mental%20illness">mentally ill</a> and <a href="mental%20retardation">mentally retarded</a>, and <a href="eugenics">eugenicist</a> <a href="E.%20S.%20Gosney">E. S. Gosney</a>'s advocacy on this issue.

Coffee was involved in the <a href="Prisons%20in%20California">California State Prison System</a>, and during his tenure at Temple Sinai he was head of the Jewish Committee of Personal Service, a California-wide organization that "ministered to Jews in state prisons". In January 1924, California's governor appointed Coffee to the State Board of Charities and Corrections, which was responsible for supervising California's state prisons.

In 1931, Coffee opposed California legislation intended to regulate the <a href="kashrut">kosher</a> food industry and prohibit fraudulent claims that foods were kosher. In a letter to state senator E.H. Christian he stated:
I am unalterably opposed to this bill because Judaism need not call upon the State to settle its own internal affairs. We are starting a dangerous precedent in California which can only lead to evil consequences.Four years ago you assisted in preventing an increase of "wine rabbis." The law relative to sacramental wine was properly surrounded, and California Jews do not suffer the disgrace which eastern brethren feel.This will bring a "meat rabbi" into existence. New York state has this kosher law and yet it did not prevent the terrible scandal which was uncovered last month in New York City. Use your best influence to prevent it.If Judaism has not enough inner resources to meet present day conditions, the sooner it passes away the better.
Despite Coffee's opposition, the legislation was enacted.

Coffee's advocacy, and Temple Israel's financial instability, eventually contributed to his dismissal from Temple Sinai in 1933; at the same time that the membership was experiencing financial distress due to the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, Coffee was advocating higher salaries for government employees. After leaving Temple Sinai, he became chaplain at <a href="San%20Quentin%20State%20Prison">San Quentin State Prison</a>.

In 1934, Temple Sinai hired William M. Stern (originally Sternheser) as rabbi. A San Francisco native and son of an Orthodox rabbi, he had been persuaded by Rabbi Martin Meyer of the Reform <a href="Congregation%20Emanu-El%20%28San%20Francisco%2C%20California%29">Congregation Emanu-El</a> to attend <a href="Hebrew%20Union%20College">Hebrew Union College</a> (HUC), where Stern received his ordination. He served as rabbi at a number of <a href="Southern%20United%20States">Southern</a> and <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">Midwestern</a> synagogues in the 1920s and early 1930s.

Much less formal than his predecessor Coffee, Stern was seen as a <a href="poker">poker</a>-playing, <a href="cigar">cigar</a>-smoking "regular guy", and he focused on combating the spread of antisemitism. His wife Rae was also very active in the congregation. She taught at the synagogue's Hebrew school, and led the sisterhood.

Although originally <a href="Anti-Zionism">anti-Zionist</a>, Stern's views changed in the 1940s, and by 1942 he was strongly supported <a href="Zionism">Jewish nationalism</a>. When an Oakland branch of the anti-Zionist <a href="American%20Council%20for%20Judaism">American Council for Judaism</a> formed in 1944, Stern opposed its creation, even though many members, including its president, were leading members of Temple Sinai. By 1948, however, the congregation had also become supportive of Zionism.

During Stern's tenure Temple Sinai expanded its facilities, adding a religious school building, offices, and a chapel in 1947–1948, and moving the main entrance to Summit Street. The main building's interior was also significantly remodeled, aside from the sanctuary. The congregation also built the Temple House (called Covenant Hall), in 1950. The following year the synagogue put on an exhibition called "Arts in Action", "that included sculptors, weavers, filmmakers, ceramists, and others." The event's director asked poet, artist and art critic <a href="Weldon%20Kees">Weldon Kees</a> to <a href="Juried%20%28competition%29">jury</a> a show of paintings; Kees ended up having to find the paintings as well. When the Temple's board saw the selected works, they did not want display all of them, but acquiesced after "a strong protest".

In 1965, the congregation bought land in <a href="Oakland%20Hills%2C%20Oakland%2C%20California">Oakland Hills</a>, anticipating a future move. In December of that year Stern died unexpectedly. Following his death, Temple Sinai held for many years an annual Stern Lecture series in his memory.

In 1966, the congregation hired Samuel Broude as rabbi. A graduate of the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a>, in the late 1940s he had worked in <a href="Pasadena%2C%20California">Pasadena</a> at a <a href="Reconstructionist%20Judaism">Reconstructionist</a> synagogue, as a part-time <a href="hazzan">cantor</a> and Hebrew teacher, and then in the early 1950s as cantor of Reform University Synagogue of Los Angeles. After completing his rabbinic training, he became associate rabbi at <a href="Congregation%20Ansche%20Chesed">Congregation Ansche Chesed</a> in <a href="Cleveland">Cleveland</a>, where he served under Rabbi <a href="Arthur%20Lelyveld">Arthur Lelyveld</a> for six years before coming to Temple Sinai.

Like Temple Sinai's previous rabbis, Broude passionately supported liberal causes, opposing U.S. involvement in the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, and taking part in marches during the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a>. Although he was a Reform rabbi, he had gone to an Orthodox "<a href="yeshiva">yeshiva</a>" as a boy, and religiously he was in many ways more traditional than his predecessors. He re-introduced ritual into the synagogue, but more contentiously opposed intermarriage. His immediate predecessor, Stern, had officiated at intermarriages "under certain conditions". Broude initially did so as well, under "extenuating circumstances" (e.g. if the bride were pregnant). His position later hardened, and he refused to perform such marriages under any circumstances. He even refused to allow other rabbis who would be willing to do so officiate at intermarriages at Temple Sinai. The issue eventually came to a congregational vote in 1972, which supported Broude, although the debate was never completely settled.

Broude was, however, not opposed to all religious innovations. Under his leadership, Temple Sinai began holding monthly fine arts performances as part of the Friday night service, in place of the usual sermon. In December 1970, the Temple's fine arts committee commissioned an original dance work from <a href="Anna%20Halprin">Anna Halprin</a> and her multi-racial dance troupe. For the next two months Broude met weekly with Halprin, educating her regarding the Friday night prayers. The completed work, titled "Kadosh", included a candlelight vigil, and dancers tearing their clothes and shouting questions at Broude that reframed the classic question about God and <a href="The%20Holocaust">The Holocaust</a> in terms of the Vietnam War: "How can there be a God if He allows all the suffering of the Vietnam War to continue?" The performance engendered passionate responses from the congregation; according to Broude "I don't know if anyone was neutral. Half thought it was fantastic, half thought it was terrible!"

Broude also argued that the congregation should remain in <a href="downtown%20Oakland">downtown Oakland</a>, and in 1975, convinced them to stay. He retired in 1989, the year the buildings survived the <a href="Loma%20Prieta%20earthquake">Loma Prieta earthquake</a>. After his retirement from Temple Sinai he remained active, filling in at synagogues mostly in the Bay Area, and teaching. He also wrote an autobiography, and a one-man show based on it called "Listening for the Voice", which he performed at a number of East Bay synagogues, including, in 2009, at Temple Sinai.

Steven Chester, a graduate of <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Los%20Angeles">UCLA</a>, and ordained by HUC in 1971, became rabbi in 1989. He had previously served as rabbi of <a href="Temple%20Beth%20Israel%20%28Jackson%2C%20Michigan%29">Temple Beth Israel</a> in Jackson, Michigan, from 1971 to 1976, and <a href="Temple%20Israel%20%28Stockton%2C%20California%29">Temple Israel</a> in Stockton, California, from 1976 to 1989, where he was also an adjunct professor in the Religious Studies department of the <a href="University%20of%20the%20Pacific%20%28United%20States%29">University of the Pacific</a>. Chester added a pre-school and adult education programs to the services offered by the synagogue, and supported the congregation's return to more traditional practices, including the re-introduction of Hebrew into the service. He also continued his predecessors' passion for social justice, taking up causes "from advocating for local affordable housing and health care for the disenfranchised to supporting women's reproductive rights and protesting the genocide in Darfur." In 2006, Chester was voted Reader's Choice for "Minister/Rabbi/Imam with the Biggest Heart" in the "<a href="East%20Bay%20Express">East Bay Express</a>".

The synagogue survived the <a href="Oakland%20Firestorm%20of%201991">Oakland Firestorm of 1991</a> mostly unscathed, although a number of congregants lost their homes. Membership was over 640 families by 1993. In 1994, the congregation again significantly remodeled the interior of the main building, aside from the sanctuary. In December of that year, the building was designated a Historic Property by the City of Oakland.

Temple Sinai has had three associate or assistant rabbis since 1998. Andrea Berlin joined the synagogue as its first assistant rabbi in 1998, after being ordained at HUC in Cincinnati. From 2006 to 2008, she also served on the board of the Jewish Family and Children's Services of the East Bay. Suzanne Singer joined Temple Sinai in 2003, after graduating from HUC in Los Angeles. Before becoming a rabbi, Singer had for two decades been a producer of television programs and documentaries, winning two <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a>s. In 2005 she became interim rabbi of <a href="Temple%20Beth%20El%20%28Riverside%2C%20California%29">Temple Beth El</a> of Riverside, California, and later its permanent rabbi. <a href="Jacqueline%20Mates-Muchin">Jacqueline Mates-Muchin</a>, a San Francisco native, graduated from HUC in New York in 2002. She is the first <a href="Chinese-American">Chinese-American</a> rabbi in the world. After serving as an assistant rabbi in Buffalo, New York, she joined Temple Sinai in 2005.

To accommodate the large number of people attending on the High Holy Days, since 2001 Temple Sinai has held its main High Holy Day services at Oakland's NRHP-listed <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a> <a href="Paramount%20Theatre%20%28Oakland%2C%20California%29">Paramount Theater</a>. While it still holds smaller High Holy Day services in the sanctuary at 2808 Summit Street, the main services at the Paramount fill the entire 1,800 seats on the mezzanine of the theater, and most of the 1,200 seats in the balcony.

In 2006, the congregation embarked on a campaign to create a new campus for Temple Sinai, to be located adjacent to the existing sanctuary and social hall. The $15 million project included "new offices, a larger chapel, a kitchen upgrade, outdoor sacred space, a new preschool with six classrooms and a 4,500-square-foot playground ... 10 additional classrooms for Midrasha teens and adult education, an art room, library, teen lounge and expanded parking." The L-shaped two-story school/office building would be , and accommodate approximately 100 children in the pre-school. The chapel, which would hold up to 250 people, would be an addition to the rear of the existing social hall.

Groundbreaking took place in October 2007, with an expected completion in Autumn, 2010. In order to accommodate the new buildings, the school and chapel built in the late 1940s were razed, along with two office buildings on adjoining lots purchased for the expansion. Nine <a href="portable%20building">portable building</a>s were installed on the campus of <a href="Merritt%20College">Merritt College</a> in <a href="Oakland%20Hills%2C%20Oakland%2C%20California">Oakland Hills</a> to serve in the interim. As of December 23, 2009, Temple Sinai had raised almost $12 million from 651 households (70% of the congregation).

Chester had planned to retire in June 2009, and the congregation embarked on a search for a new senior rabbi in 2008. Twenty-three candidates were narrowed down to one finalist, but in early December that individual informed the search committee that he was withdrawing his name from consideration. While the search was progressing, Chester had realized that, due to the <a href="financial%20crisis%20of%202007%E2%80%932010">2008 financial crisis</a>, he would have to keep working. After the main candidate withdrew, the synagogue's president approached Chester, asking if he would stay on for another term, which Chester agreed to do. Chester retired in June 2011, becoming (along with Broude) Rabbi Emeritus.

Andrew Straus joined Temple Sinai as senior rabbi in December 2011. A graduate of HUC, he had previously served as assistant rabbi of <a href="Peninsula%20Temple%20Sholom">Peninsula Temple Sholom</a> in Burlingame, California, Temple Beth Sholom of New City, New York, and most recently for 13 years as rabbi of Temple Emanuel of Tempe, Arizona. Rabbi Straus resigned his position in 2014 by mutual consent with the Board of Trustees. In January 2015, Rabbi Mates-Muchin was overwhelmingly elected senior rabbi. As of 2014, Temple Sinai, the East Bay's oldest synagogue, had nearly 1,000 member families. The full-time rabbis were Mates-Muchin and Yoni Regev, and the cantor was Ilene Keys.

SS Dakotan

SS "Dakotan was a <a href="cargo%20ship">cargo ship</a> built in 1912 for the <a href="American-Hawaiian%20Steamship%20Company">American-Hawaiian Steamship Company</a> that served as a <a href="transport%20ship">transport ship</a> in the United States <a href="Army%20Transport%20Service">Army Transport Service</a> in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, and then was transferred to the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> under <a href="Lend-Lease">Lend-Lease</a> in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> before being finally scrapped in 1969. During World War I, she was taken over by the United States Army as USAT "Dakotan. Near the end of that war she was transferred to the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> and <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> as USS "Dakotan" (ID-3882). During World War II, the ship was transferred to the Soviet Union and renamed SS "Zyrianin (or Зырянин" in <a href="Cyrillic%20script">Cyrillic</a>).

"Dakotan" was built by the <a href="Maryland%20Steel%20Company">Maryland Steel Company</a> as one of eight sister ships for the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company, and was employed in inter-coastal service via the <a href="Isthmus%20of%20Tehuantepec">Isthmus of Tehuantepec</a> and the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a> after it opened. During World War I, as USAT "Dakotan", the ship carried cargo and animals to France. "Dakotan" was in the first American convoy to sail to France after the United States entered the war in April 1917. In Navy service, USS "Dakotan" carried cargo to France and returned over 8,800 American troops after the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany">Armistice</a>.

After her Navy service ended in 1919, she was returned to her original owners and resumed relatively uneventful cargo service over the next twenty years. "Dakotan" ran aground off the coast of Mexico in 1923 but was freed and towed to port for repairs. Early in World War II, the ship was requisitioned by the <a href="War%20Shipping%20Administration">War Shipping Administration</a> and transferred to the Soviet Union under the terms of <a href="Lend-Lease">Lend-Lease</a> in December 1942. Sailing as SS "Zyrianin", the ship remained a part of the Soviet <a href="merchant%20fleet">merchant fleet</a> into the late 1960s.

In September 1911, the <a href="American-Hawaiian%20Steamship%20Company">American-Hawaiian Steamship Company</a> placed an order with the <a href="Maryland%20Steel%20Company">Maryland Steel Company</a> of <a href="Sparrows%20Point%2C%20Maryland">Sparrows Point, Maryland</a>, for four new <a href="cargo%20ships">cargo ships</a>—, "Dakotan", , and . The contract cost of the ships was set at the construction cost plus an 8% profit for Maryland Steel, but with a maximum cost of $640,000 per ship. The construction was financed by Maryland Steel with a credit plan that called for a 5% down payment in cash with nine monthly installments for the balance. The deal had provisions that allowed some of the nine installments to be converted into longer-term notes or mortgages. The final cost of "Dakotan", including financing costs, was $66.00 per <a href="deadweight%20tonnage">deadweight ton</a>, which totaled just under $672,000.

"Dakotan" (Maryland Steel yard no. 125) was the second ship built under the original contract. She was <a href="ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 10 August 1912, and delivered to American-Hawaiian in November. "Dakotan" was , and was in length and <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">abeam</a>. She had a <a href="deadweight%20tonnage">deadweight tonnage</a> of and a storage capacity of . A single <a href="steam%20engine">steam engine</a> with oil-fired <a href="boiler">boiler</a>s driving a single <a href="screw%20propeller">screw propeller</a> provided her power; her speed was . The steamer had accommodations for 18 officers, 40 crewmen, and could carry up to 16 passengers.

When "Dakotan" began sailing for American-Hawaiian, the company shipped cargo from <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast</a> ports via the Tehuantepec Route to <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast</a> ports and <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, and vice versa. Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route arrived at Mexican ports—<a href="Salina%20Cruz">Salina Cruz, Oaxaca</a>, for eastbound cargo, and <a href="Coatzacoalcos">Coatzacoalcos</a> for westbound cargo—and traversed the <a href="Isthmus%20of%20Tehuantepec">Isthmus of Tehuantepec</a> on the <a href="Tehuantepec%20National%20Railway">Tehuantepec National Railway</a>. Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii, while westbound cargoes were general in nature. "Dakotan" sailed in this service on the east side of North America.

At the time of the <a href="United%20States%20occupation%20of%20Veracruz">United States occupation of Veracruz</a> on 21 April 1914, "Dakotan" was in port at Coatzacoalcos. There she loaded 127 American refugees from sugar plantations in the area and steamed to <a href="Veracruz%2C%20Veracruz">Veracruz</a>. As a consequence of the American action, the <a href="Victoriano%20Huerta">Huerta</a>-led Mexican government closed the Tehuantepec National Railway to American shipping.

In early May, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" reported that "Dakotan" had sailed to <a href="Crist%C3%B3bal%2C%20Col%C3%B3n">Cristóbal</a> to pick up a cargo of sugar that had been originally slated for transport via Tehuantepec. According to the article, the sugar was to be carried on barges through the still-unopened <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a>, then loaded onto "Dakotan". There was no indication in the newspaper whether this mission was completed or not, but it is known that American-Hawaii returned to its historic route of sailing cargo around South America via the <a href="Straits%20of%20Magellan">Straits of Magellan</a> after Tehuantepec was closed but before the canal opened.

With the opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August, American-Hawaiian ships switched to using the canal. In early September, American-Hawaiian announced that "Dakotan" would sail on a route from New York via the canal to <a href="San%20Francisco%2C%20California">San Francisco</a> and on to either <a href="Seattle%2C%20Washington">Seattle</a> or <a href="Tacoma%2C%20Washington">Tacoma</a>. When landslides closed the canal in October 1915, all American-Hawaiian ships, including "Dakotan", returned to the Straits of Magellan route.

In 1916, "Dakotan" was one of several American-Hawaiian cargo ships <a href="ship%20chartering">chartered</a> by the <a href="DuPont">DuPont Nitrate Company</a> to carry <a href="sodium%20nitrate">sodium nitrate</a> from <a href="Chile">Chile</a> to the United States. "Dakotan" and the other cargo ships in this South American service would typically deliver loads of coal, gasoline, or steel in exchange for the sodium nitrate. In May, "<a href="The%20Christian%20Science%20Monitor">The Christian Science Monitor</a>" reported on what may have been a typical delivery for "Dakotan". The ship had left <a href="Tocopilla">Tocopilla</a> with 91,872 bags—about —of sodium nitrate for use in making explosives, and, after transiting the newly reopened Panama Canal, arrived in <a href="Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania">Philadelphia</a>.

After the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917, the United States Army, needing transports to move its men and <a href="materiel">materiel</a> to France, convened a select committee of shipping executives who pored over registries of American shipping to evaluate transport capabilities. The committee selected "Dakotan", her sister ship "Montanan", and twelve other American-flagged ships that were sufficiently fast, could carry enough fuel in their <a href="%3Awikt%3Abunker">bunkers</a> for <a href="transatlantic%20crossing">transatlantic crossing</a>s, and, most importantly, were in port or not far at sea. After "Dakotan" discharged her last load of cargo, she was officially handed over to the Army on 29 May.

Before troop transportation began, all of the ships were hastily refitted. Of the fourteen ships, four, including "Dakotan" and "Montanan", were designated to carry animals and cargo; the other ten were designated to carry human passengers. Ramps and stalls were built on the four ships chosen to carry animals. Gun platforms were installed on each ship before it docked at the <a href="Brooklyn%20Navy%20Yard">Brooklyn Navy Yard</a>, where the guns were put in place. All the ships were manned by merchant officers and crews but carried military personnel: two U.S. Navy officers, Navy gun crews, <a href="quartermaster">quartermaster</a>s, <a href="signalman%20%28rank%29">signalmen</a>, and <a href="radio">wireless</a> operators. The senior Navy officer on board would take control if a ship came under attack.

The American convoy carrying the first units of the <a href="American%20Expeditionary%20Force">American Expeditionary Force</a> was separated into four groups; "Dakotan" was in the fourth group with her sister ship "Montanan", Army transports and , and accompanied by the group's escorts: <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a> , U.S. Navy <a href="transport">transport</a> , and <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s , , and . "Dakotan" departed with her group on the morning of 17 June for <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a>, France, steaming at an pace. A thwarted submarine attack on the first convoy group, and reports of heavy submarine activity off of Brest resulted in a change in the convoy's destination to <a href="Saint-Nazaire">Saint-Nazaire</a>.

"Dakotan" departed Saint-Nazaire on 14 July in the company of her convoy mates "El Occidente", "Montanan", and "Edward Luckenbach". Joining the return trip were Army transport , Navy armed <a href="collier%20%28ship%29">collier</a> , Navy <a href="oiler%20%28ship%29">oiler</a> , and <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a> , the flagship of <a href="Rear%20admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Albert%20Gleaves">Albert Gleaves</a>, the head of the Navy's <a href="Cruiser%20and%20Transport%20Force">Cruiser and Transport Force</a>.
Sources do not reveal "Dakotan"s movements over the next months, but on 6 September 1917, the <a href="Naval%20Armed%20Guard">Naval Armed Guard</a>smen aboard "Dakotan" shelled a German submarine after its <a href="periscope">periscope</a> had been sighted. On 29 January 1919, "Dakotan" was transferred to the Navy and <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> the same day, with <a href="Lieutenant%20Commander%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant Commander</a> J. Simmons, <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Reserve%20Forces">United States Naval Reserve Forces</a> (USNRF), in command. Outfitted for service as a <a href="troop%20transport">troop transport</a> to return American servicemen from Europe, "Dakotan" made five transatlantic roundtrips to France as part of the Navy's <a href="Cruiser%20and%20Transport%20Force">Cruiser and Transport Force</a> between 15 February and 20 July. Eastbound journeys delivered cargo to Saint-Nazaire and <a href="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a> for the <a href="US%20Army">Army of Occupation</a>; westbound trips returned soldiers to the United States. "Dakotan" carried a total of 8,812 troops on her five westbound voyages. "Dakotan" returned from her final voyage on 20 July, was decommissioned at New York on 31 July, and returned to American-Hawaiian the same day.

"Dakotan" resumed cargo service with American-Hawaiian after her return from World War I service. Although the company had abandoned its original Hawaiian sugar routes, "Dakotan" continued inter-coastal service through the Panama Canal in a relatively uneventful manner over the next twenty years. One incident of note occurred on 20 August 1923 when "Dakotan" issued <a href="distress%20call">distress call</a>s after she ran aground at <a href="Cabo%20San%20Lazaro">Cabo San Lázaro</a> on the Pacific coast of Mexico. The Navy transport ship and the <a href="Standard%20Oil">Standard Oil</a> <a href="tank%20ship">tanker</a> "Charles Pratt" responded to "Dakotan"s calls. "Charles Pratt" successfully freed "Dakotan", which had suffered damage to her <a href="Rudder%23Boat%20rudders%20details">rudder post</a> in the accident. The American-Hawaiian ship "Nevadan" arrived and towed "Dakotan" to <a href="Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Los Angeles</a> for repairs.
In 1933, two members of "Dakotan"s crew had medical emergencies that received news coverage. The first, in February, involved a seaman with an abdominal disorder. He was transferred from the eastbound "Dakotan" to the <a href="Dollar%20Line">Dollar Line</a> ocean liner which carried him to Los Angeles to receive medical attention. The second occurred in July when "Dakotan"s <a href="quartermaster%20%28naval%29">quartermaster</a> came down with <a href="appendicitis">appendicitis</a> near <a href="Balboa%2C%20Panama">Balboa</a>. Radio calls for assistance brought the U.S. Navy's Destroyer Division 7 to "Dakotan"s aid. The destroyer unit's medical officer boarded "Dakotan" and performed an <a href="Appendicectomy">appendectomy</a> on the man, who was too ill to be moved off the ship.

After the United States entered <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, in 1941 - though most of Europe had been involved since summer 1939 - "Dakotan" was requisitioned by the <a href="War%20Shipping%20Administration">War Shipping Administration</a> (WSA), but continued to be operated by American-Hawaiian. In December 1942, "Dakotan" was transferred to the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> under <a href="Lend-Lease">Lend-Lease</a>, and renamed "Zyrianin" ("Зырянин" ). Throughout the rest of the war, "Dakotan" made at least one trip to the United States, being photographed in port at San Francisco in August 1943. Near the end of World War II, the WSA offered a payment of $670,210 to American-Hawaiian for the former "Dakotan" as part of a $7.2 million settlement for eleven American-Hawaiian ships that had been requisitioned by the WSA. "Zyrianin" remained a part of the Soviet merchant fleet through the 1960s, and was listed in "<a href="Lloyd%27s%20Register">Lloyd's Register</a>" until the 1970–71 edition.

"Zyrianin" was operated by the <a href="Far%20East%20Shipping%20Company">Far East Shipping Company</a> () from 1943 to 1957. From 1957, she was operated by the <a href="Black%20Sea%20Shipping%20Company">Black Sea Shipping Company</a>. The ship was written off and scrapped at <a href="Split%2C%20Croatia">Split</a>, <a href="Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> in 1969.

2003–04 Arsenal F.C. season

The 2003–04 season was the 109th in the history of <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal Football Club</a>. It began on 1 July 2003 and concluded on 30 June 2004, with competitive matches played between August and May. The club ended the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> campaign as champions without a single defeat – a record of 26 wins and 12 draws. Arsenal fared less well in the cups, eliminated in the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> and <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a> semi-finals to <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> and <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a> respectively, and at the quarter-final stage of the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20knockout%20stage">UEFA Champions League</a> to <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>.

Arsenal did little business in the <a href="transfer%20market">transfer market</a> early in the season due to the financial demands that came with the club's <a href="Emirates%20Stadium">new stadium project</a>. The main addition to the first team was goalkeeper <a href="Jens%20Lehmann">Jens Lehmann</a> for £1.5 million; striker <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Antonio%20Reyes">José Antonio Reyes</a> was later purchased in the winter transfer window. Arsenal retained their best players and successfully negotiated new contracts for captain <a href="Patrick%20Vieira">Patrick Vieira</a> and midfielder <a href="Robert%20Pires">Robert Pires</a>. The stability of the squad meant Arsenal were considered front-runners for the Premier League title, along with Manchester United, and Chelsea who were taken over by Russian billionaire <a href="Roman%20Abramovich">Roman Abramovich</a>.

A strong start to the season saw Arsenal top the league table after four matches. The team's draw at Manchester United in September marked an unsavoury episode between both clubs: several Arsenal players were charged and fined accordingly by <a href="The%20Football%20Association">The Football Association</a> for their part in a mass brawl that occurred after the match. In November, Arsenal beat <a href="FC%20Dynamo%20Kyiv">Dynamo Kyiv</a> by a single goal and more impressively scored five against <a href="Inter%20Milan">Inter Milan</a> at the <a href="San%20Siro">San Siro</a> – two results which kick-started their Champions League campaign. At the turn of the year, the team won nine league matches in a row to consolidate first position. In the first week of April, they were eliminated from the FA Cup and Champions League, but by the end of the month had secured their status as league champions, with a 2–2 draw against local rivals <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a>.

34 different players represented the club in five competitions and there were 15 different goalscorers. Arsenal's top goalscorer for the third year running was <a href="Thierry%20Henry">Thierry Henry</a>, who scored 39 goals in 51 games. The Frenchman was given the accolade of <a href="PFA%20Players%27%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">PFA Players' Player of the Year</a> by his fellow peers and the <a href="FWA%20Footballer%20of%20the%20Year">FWA Footballer of the Year</a> by football writers. Although the Arsenal team were unsuccessful in cup competitions, their dominance in the league was regarded by many commentators as a standalone achievement. They acquired the nickname "<a href="The%20Invincibles%20%28football%29">The Invincibles</a>", much like the <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a> team that went unbeaten in the inaugural <a href="The%20Football%20League">Football League</a> season. The club was awarded a golden replica trophy by the Premier League once the season concluded and they remained unbeaten for 49 games, setting a new record. In 2012, the Arsenal team of 2003–04 won the "Best Team" category in the <a href="Premier%20League%2020%20Seasons%20Awards">Premier League 20 Seasons Awards</a>.

Arsenal had finished the previous season as runners-up in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, overhauled by <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> in the final ten weeks of the season. The club did, however, retain the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>, with a <a href="2003%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1–0 win</a> against <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a>. Such was Arsenal's effective start to the 2002–03 campaign, manager <a href="Ars%C3%A8ne%20Wenger">Arsène Wenger</a> suggested his team could remain the whole season undefeated in all competitions: "It's not impossible as <a href="A.C.%20Milan">A.C. Milan</a> once did it but I can't see why it's so shocking to say it. Do you think Manchester United, <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> or <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> don't dream that as well? They're exactly the same. They just don't say it because they're scared to look ridiculous, but nobody is ridiculous in this job as we know anything can happen." The team lost to <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> a month after Wenger's proclamation; teenager <a href="Wayne%20Rooney">Wayne Rooney</a> scored the match winner, which ended a run of 30 league games without defeat. By February 2003, Arsenal moved five points clear of Manchester United at the top of the league table, but injuries to key players, not least captain <a href="Patrick%20Vieira">Patrick Vieira</a>, had destabilised the team. Draws in April, coupled with a defeat to <a href="Leeds%20United%20A.F.C.">Leeds United</a> at home, mathematically ended Arsenal's chances of retaining the title. Wenger refuted opinions from the media that their season was a failure and said: 

In the close season, Chelsea was sold to Russian billionaire <a href="Roman%20Abramovich">Roman Abramovich</a> for £140 million, the biggest takeover in British football history at the time. The takeover was welcomed by journalist Daniel King, who commented the club were better able to "break the Manchester United-Arsenal duopoly" in the league. Arsenal vice-chairman <a href="David%20Dein">David Dein</a> however was displeased, and quipped that Abramovich had "parked his Russian tanks on our lawn and is firing £50 notes at us", Abramovich was said to have placed a bid for Arsenal striker <a href="Thierry%20Henry">Thierry Henry</a>, which was turned down at once.

Arsenal's transfer activity in the summer was relatively quiet, given the financial constraints that came with the club's <a href="Emirates%20Stadium">new stadium</a> project. The club were able to keep the core of its team, successfully negotiating new contracts for Vieira and winger <a href="Robert%20Pires">Robert Pires</a>. German goalkeeper <a href="Jens%20Lehmann">Jens Lehmann</a> was the only major addition to the first team; he replaced <a href="David%20Seaman">David Seaman</a> who joined <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>. Ukrainian defender <a href="Oleh%20Luzhny">Oleh Luzhny</a> ended his four-year association with the club by joining <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> on a free transfer, while striker <a href="Graham%20Barrett">Graham Barrett</a> moved to <a href="Coventry%20City%20F.C.">Coventry City</a>. Striker <a href="Francis%20Jeffers">Francis Jeffers</a>, who found opportunities limited in the first team, joined his former club Everton on a season-long loan. <a href="Giovanni%20van%20Bronckhorst">Giovanni van Bronckhorst</a> moved to <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> on a similar deal, with a view to a permanent transfer at the end of the season. Several young players were acquired from academies abroad, namely <a href="Ga%C3%ABl%20Clichy">Gaël Clichy</a> from <a href="AS%20Cannes">Cannes</a> and <a href="Johan%20Djourou">Johan Djourou</a>, formerly of <a href="%C3%89toile%20Carouge%20FC">Étoile Carouge</a>. In January 2004, Arsenal signed Spanish striker <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Antonio%20Reyes">José Antonio Reyes</a> from <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a> and in April agreed a deal with <a href="Feyenoord">Feyenoord</a> for winger <a href="Robin%20van%20Persie">Robin van Persie</a>.

Wenger at the start of the season prioritised regaining the league title: "I feel it is very important in our minds to do this and I know the hunger is strong to do it," and named <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a> and Liverpool, along with Manchester United and Chelsea, as Arsenal's main rivals for the Premier League. Former Arsenal midfielder <a href="Paul%20Merson">Paul Merson</a> asserted that his old club were favourites because they had the "best players … If they all remain fit week-in week-out then they will not be beaten." Glenn Moore of "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" wrote of Arsenal's chances: "They will be thereabouts, but unless Wenger finally puts his faith in youth, and the likes of <a href="J%C3%A9r%C3%A9mie%20Aliadi%C3%A8re">Jérémie Aliadière</a>, <a href="Jermaine%20Pennant">Jermaine Pennant</a> and <a href="Phillipe%20Senderos">Phillipe Senderos</a> repay him, they may lack the depth to sustain a title campaign." Defender <a href="Sol%20Campbell">Sol Campbell</a> however believed the squad was "strong enough for the league and FA Cup", but doubted their chances of winning the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a>.

The club's home strip remained unchanged from the previous season; a red jersey with white sleeves, shorts and socks. The new away kit, a retro yellow jersey with a blue collar trim and shorts, was based on the Arsenal strip worn in the <a href="1979%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1979 FA Cup Final</a>.

To prepare for the forthcoming season, Arsenal played a series of <a href="Friendly%20matches">friendlies</a> across Western Europe. Their first match ended in defeat against <a href="Peterborough%20United%20F.C.">Peterborough United</a> of the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a>; goalkeeper <a href="Stuart%20Taylor%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201980%29">Stuart Taylor</a> was forced to come off the field after colliding with Peterborough substitute <a href="Lee%20Clarke">Lee Clarke</a> in the second half. Arsenal then played out a draw against <a href="Barnet%20F.C.">Barnet</a>, where trialist <a href="Yaya%20Tour%C3%A9">Yaya Touré</a> – the brother of <a href="Kolo%20Tour%C3%A9">Kolo</a>, was included in the team. In a 2011 interview, Wenger recalled Yaya's performance as being "completely average on the day" and noted his impatience stopped him from joining Arsenal; Touré went on to play for <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> before joining Manchester City in 2010. Arsenal undertook a tour in Austria, a year after crowd troubles forced their match in Eisenstadt to be abandoned. Wenger was absent with a stomach upset so assistant manager <a href="Pat%20Rice">Pat Rice</a> took charge of Arsenal against <a href="SC%20Ritzing">SC Ritzing</a> on 22 July 2003; the team came from two goals down to draw their second consecutive friendly. Rice was pleased with <a href="Philippe%20Senderos">Philippe Senderos</a>' cameo in defence and said: "Still some rough edges but he will only get better working with Martin Keown and Sol Campbell."

Arsenal recorded their first win of the pre-season against <a href="FK%20Austria%20Wien">Austria Wien</a>. Bergkamp capped off a "superb individual display" by scoring the first goal and setting up the second for Jeffers. The final match of the tour was against <a href="Be%C5%9Fikta%C5%9F%20J.K.">Beşiktaş</a>, which required tightened security given the <a href="2000%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final%20riots">history</a> between English and Turkish football supporters. Bergkamp scored the only goal of the match in the second half, "a cheeky effort through keeper <a href="%C3%93scar%20C%C3%B3rdoba">Óscar Córdoba</a>'s legs". An Arsenal XI in England two days later faced <a href="St%20Albans%20City%20F.C.">St Albans City</a>, where they won 3–1. The main squad then travelled to Scotland to play <a href="Celtic%20F.C.">Celtic</a> on 2 August 2003. Both goals in the one-all draw came in the second half; the match marked the return of Vieira after three months out with a knee problem. Wenger revealed afterwards that he intended to use the pre-season as an experiment for his defence. He partnered centre back Campbell with Touré, who for much of last season played in midfield. Wenger was pleased with Touré's performance against Celtic and said: "He has quality. He was originally a central defender and, because we have kept a few clean sheets recently and he's played well, I thought we'd keep him there." An Arsenal XI travelled to Belgium for a game against <a href="K.S.K.%20Beveren">Beveren</a> and conceded two goals in the final five minutes to draw the match 2–2. Arsenal rounded off their pre-season preparations with a 3–0 win against <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a> on 5 August 2003.

The 2003 edition of the <a href="FA%20Community%20Shield">FA Community Shield</a>, an annual English <a href="association%20football">football</a> match, was contested between Manchester United and Arsenal at Cardiff's <a href="Millennium%20Stadium">Millennium Stadium</a> on 10 August. Lehmann made his first competitive start for Arsenal and Touré continued to partner Campbell in central defence. United took a 15th-minute lead through <a href="Mika%C3%ABl%20Silvestre">Mikaël Silvestre</a>, but Henry equalised for Arsenal soon after, from a free-kick. Jeffers was sent off in the second half for kicking out at <a href="Phil%20Neville">Phil Neville</a> and no further goals scored meant the outcome of the match was decided by a <a href="Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29">penalty shoot-out</a>. Goalkeeper <a href="Tim%20Howard">Tim Howard</a> saved Van Bronckhorst and Pires' spot kicks as United won the game 4–3 on penalties. Wenger made reference to Arsenal's low crowd turnout after the match and suggested it meant there was "less and less appetite" for the Shield. He was unhappy with the league season commencing on the following Saturday: "I would have preferred to have had two more weeks, especially for the French players who were in the <a href="FIFA%20Confederations%20Cup">Confederations Cup</a>. We certainly were not as fit as Manchester United and know many of our players were behind them fitness-wise."

The 2003–04 season of the Premier League saw 20 teams play 38 matches; two against every other team, with one match at each club's stadium. Three points were awarded for each win, one point per draw, and none for defeats. At the end of the season the top two teams qualified for the group stages of the UEFA Champions League; teams in third and fourth needed to play a qualifier.

The provisional fixture list was released on 19 June 2003, but was subject to change in the event of clashes with other competitions, international football, inclement weather, or matches chosen for television coverage. Five of Arsenal's first eight fixtures were broadcast on <a href="Sky%20Sports">Sky Sports</a>, three of which were on the network's flagship programme "<a href="Super%20Sunday%20%28Sky%20Sports%29">Super Sunday</a>".

Arsenal hosted Everton at <a href="Arsenal%20Stadium">Highbury</a> on the opening weekend of the season. Campbell was sent off in the 25th minute, for a professional foul on Everton midfielder <a href="Thomas%20Gravesen">Thomas Gravesen</a>. Arsenal, despite their man disadvantage, went two goals up after 58 minutes, before <a href="Tomasz%20Radzinski">Tomasz Radzinski</a> scored for the visitors late on. A trip to the <a href="Riverside%20Stadium">Riverside Stadium</a> to face <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a> a week after ended in a 4–0 win; the first three goals, scored by Henry, <a href="Gilberto%20Silva">Gilberto Silva</a> and <a href="Sylvain%20Wiltord">Sylvain Wiltord</a> all came in the first half. Three days later, Campbell and Henry each scored as <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> were beaten by two goals. Arsenal continued their perfect start to the season, with an away win against Manchester City on 31 August 2003. As Campbell was suspended, <a href="Martin%20Keown">Martin Keown</a> came into the first team to partner Touré. Although Arsenal conceded first – a "comical" own goal by <a href="Lauren%20%28footballer%29">Lauren</a> – and played "the worst 45 minutes that any of their fans could remember" according to journalist <a href="Matt%20Dickinson%20%28journalist%29">Matt Dickinson</a>, Wiltord equalised in the second half, before <a href="Freddie%20Ljungberg">Freddie Ljungberg</a> had taken advantage of a Seaman error to score the winning goal. After four matches, Arsenal stood in first position, three points clear of Manchester United.
Due to international fixtures, Arsenal did not play another game for two weeks. On the resumption of club football, they faced newly promoted <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a> at home. Striker <a href="Teddy%20Sheringham">Teddy Sheringham</a> gave the visitors a deserved lead, before Arsenal were awarded a penalty when Pires was adjudged to have been fouled in the <a href="penalty%20area">penalty area</a> by <a href="Dejan%20Stefanovi%C4%87">Dejan Stefanović</a>. Henry scored, and though their performance noticeably improved in the second half, the game ended in a draw. Portsmouth manager <a href="Harry%20Redknapp">Harry Redknapp</a> complained about the penalty decision post-match and felt Pires "…was going to get a yellow card [for diving]." The player himself denied accusations that he deceived the referee: "I did not dive and I am not a cheat. That is not the way I play."

A week later, <a href="Battle%20of%20Old%20Trafford">Arsenal travelled to face Manchester United</a> at <a href="Old%20Trafford">Old Trafford</a>. Pires and Wiltord were dropped by Wenger in favour of <a href="Ray%20Parlour">Ray Parlour</a> and Ljungberg; Campbell did not travel due to family bereavement. In the 80th minute, Vieira was sent off for a second bookable offence; he attempted to kick out at striker <a href="Ruud%20van%20Nistelrooy">Ruud van Nistelrooy</a>, which was seen by referee <a href="Steve%20Bennett%20%28referee%29">Steve Bennett</a>. With the score 0–0, United were awarded a penalty in the 90th minute, but Van Nistelrooy's spot kick hit the bar and rebounded back into play. At the final whistle, Van Nistelrooy was immediately confronted by several Arsenal players, which escalated into an altercation between both teams. Six of Arsenal's players (<a href="Ashley%20Cole">Ashley Cole</a>, Lauren, Keown, Parlour, Lehmann, Vieira) were later charged with improper conduct by <a href="The%20Football%20Association">The Football Association</a> (FA), while the club were fined £175,000, the largest ever given to a club by the FA. Lauren received a four-game ban, whereas Vieira and Parlour were given one-match suspensions.

In their next match, Arsenal defeated Newcastle United by three goals to two; the winner was a penalty scored by Henry. Vieira suffered an injury during the game; this commenced a period of him being in and out of the side, for two months. Arsenal then faced Liverpool on the first weekend of October at <a href="Anfield">Anfield</a>. In the absence of Vieira, Parlour was on duty as captain, while Campbell replaced Keown in defence. Aliadière was paired alongside Henry in attack. Arsenal went a goal down after 11 minutes, but equalised when <a href="Sami%20Hyypi%C3%A4">Sami Hyypiä</a> unintentionally diverted Edu's header, from an Arsenal free-kick. Pires scored the winner in the second half, which maintained the team's lead at the top of the league table. "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" correspondent <a href="Oliver%20Kay">Oliver Kay</a> described Arsenal's comeback as "spirited" and noted a difference with the team, in comparison to the previous season:

A tightly-fought match against Chelsea at home was settled by a second half error by goalkeeper <a href="Carlo%20Cudicini">Carlo Cudicini</a>, which presented Henry with his seventh league goal in nine matches. Both teams up until that point were level on points at the top of the table and unbeaten. Wenger noted after the match that Chelsea's bigger squad would serve them well as the season progressed, but stressed his smaller squad had stability: "We have been together for years and have the comfort of knowing we have won things before. When we are challenged, we become even more united." Arsenal ended October with a 1–1 draw against <a href="Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.">Charlton Athletic</a>. After 10 games, Arsenal garnered 24 points. The point earnt at Charlton was enough for the team to move back into first position, which had been occupied by Chelsea.

Arsenal began November with a trip to <a href="Elland%20Road">Elland Road</a> to face Leeds United. There were no changes to the team from the Charlton game; for Leeds, Pennant started against his parent club after being granted permission by Wenger. Arsenal's victory by four goals to one was identical to the scoreline in the corresponding fixture of last season. In a match report for the "<a href="News%20of%20the%20World">News of the World</a>", journalist <a href="Martin%20Samuel">Martin Samuel</a> picked Henry as the <a href="man%20of%20the%20match">man of the match</a> and asserted Arsenal remained the team to beat. Attention soon turned to the <a href="North%20London%20derby">North London derby</a>, where Arsenal played <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> on 8 November 2003. Tottenham had not beaten their rivals since November 1999 and their last win at Highbury had come a decade previously. <a href="Nwankwo%20Kanu">Kanu</a> was brought into the starting line-up to partner Henry, as Wiltord was ruled out with a calf strain. Arsenal conceded an early goal after <a href="Darren%20Anderton">Darren Anderton</a> capitalised on a defensive mix-up, but they scored two late goals in what was described as "another stuttering" performance in "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>". The result put Arsenal four points clear in first, albeit temporarily as Chelsea's win at home to Newcastle United 24 hours later cut their gap to one point.
Arsenal did not play another game for a fortnight because of the international football break. On the resumption of club football, they played <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a> away from home. As suspensions came into action and there were injuries to first-team players, Wenger was forced to reshuffle his team. Clichy was handed his full debut and <a href="Pascal%20Cygan">Pascal Cygan</a> made his first start of the season, partnering Campbell. Ljungberg opened the scoring for Arsenal inside four minutes and further goals by Bergkamp and Pires ensured the team won their third straight match of November. By extending their unbeaten run from the start of the season to 13 league matches, Arsenal set a new Premier League record. They were then held by <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a> to a goalless draw who became the first team to deny Arsenal from scoring in 46 league matches at Highbury. "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" correspondent <a href="David%20Lacey">David Lacey</a> summarised Arsenal's football on the day as "strong in the string section but short on percussion" and noted they reverted to the pattern of scoring a perfect goal, instead of being efficient. Chelsea's 1–0 win over Manchester United meant Arsenal moved down to second place on the final day of November.

Two more points were dropped in Arsenal's next match, away to <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a> on the first weekend of December. Henry was absent from the starting team as was captain Vieira. Arsenal had taken the lead at the hour mark through a Gilberto header, but conceded the equaliser in <a href="stoppage%20time">stoppage time</a>. What made matters worse was the dismissal of Cole for a two-footed lunge on <a href="Ben%20Thatcher">Ben Thatcher</a>; he missed the team's next three fixtures as a result. Wenger said afterwards: "It looked like Ashley wanted to get the ball but it was a two-footed tackle that was too high, it was a red card and we have to accept it." A goal from Bergkamp earned Arsenal a 1–0 win the following week, at home to <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers">Blackburn Rovers</a>. Chelsea's defeat a day before meant the win for Arsenal was enough to take them back top, a point clear of Manchester United, who were now in second place.

Arsenal then travelled to the <a href="Reebok%20Stadium">Reebok Stadium</a> to play <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton</a> on 20 December 2003, the setting where their title challenge faltered eight months ago. Although they again picked up just a point, Wenger believed it was a useful one: "Provided Bolton keep playing like that, we will look back at this result and feel very happy. They are as good as a team as we have played." On <a href="Boxing%20Day">Boxing Day</a>, Henry scored twice for Arsenal in a 3–0 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Three days later, the team played Southampton. The only goal of the match came in the first half: Henry's through pass found Pires "who slid the ball beneath the exposed <a href="Antti%20Niemi%20%28footballer%29">Antti Niemi</a>". The win meant Arsenal had gone half the season without losing and the team according to "The Times" had begun to "establish an aura of invincibility". Arsenal ended the calendar year in second place, with 45 points from 19 matches. They were one point behind leaders Manchester United and three ahead of Chelsea.

On 7 January 2004, Arsenal played Everton at <a href="Goodison%20Park">Goodison Park</a>. Wenger made a host of changes: Cygan was recalled in central defence, which meant Touré was shifted onto the right and Lauren was dropped, while Parlour started in place of Gilberto in midfield. Kanu had given Arsenal the lead in the first half, only for Radzinski to score a "richly deserved late equaliser" for Everton with fifteen minutes remaining. Manchester United's victory at Bolton on the same night increased the champions' lead at the top to three points. Three days after the Everton match, Arsenal hosted Middlesbrough and put on a display Wenger described as one of the season's best: "We kept playing our natural game and could have scored more," he said. The 4–1 win meant Arsenal moved back top of the league, albeit alphabetically as their points, goal difference and goals scored were identical to that of Manchester United. A week later Arsenal beat Aston Villa by two goals to nil; both of the team's goals were scored by Henry. Controversy surrounded the Frenchman's first goal, a quickly taken free-kick which prompted confusion amongst Villa's players and brought about a reaction towards referee <a href="Mark%20Halsey">Mark Halsey</a>, who signalled it was permissible. After 22 games played, Arsenal were in first place, two points clear of Manchester United.
Arsenal remained unbeaten throughout February, winning all five matches. In a home match against Manchester City, Reyes made his first appearance for the club, coming on as a substitute in the second half. He had no part in the winning goal, a "crunching, beautifully judged 25-yarder" scored by Henry. Arsenal recorded an away win at Wolverhampton Wanderers on 7 February 2004, their 24th league match, which bettered a club record of games unbeaten from the start of the season (originally held by <a href="George%20Graham%20%28footballer%29">George Graham</a>'s team of <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Arsenal%20F.C.%20season">1990–91</a>). Wenger in his post-match press conference played down the record, and said of the unbeaten run: "You need a little bit of luck and mental qualities." Henry reached a personal landmark against Southampton three days later, scoring his 100th and 101st Premier League goals. The victory moved Arsenal five points clear at the top, although they had played one more game than Manchester United.

A Saturday lunchtime kick-off against Chelsea saw the return of Henry; he was absent in Arsenal's FA Cup fifth round win against the same opposition. Arsenal found themselves a goal down after 27 seconds, but responded with an equaliser in the 15th minute – Bergkamp's "delicately curving pass" found Vieira on the left side to shoot the ball past goalkeeper <a href="Neil%20Sullivan">Neil Sullivan</a>. The winner came six minutes later: Sullivan misjudged a corner taken by Henry, which allowed Edu to shoot into an empty net. Arsenal's lead was now seven and it represented "a stronger position than any they held last season" according to Wenger. Touré's transition into a defender was highlighted in "The Times" football supplement:

The final match of the month was against Charlton at Highbury. Arsenal scored twice in the space of the opening four minutes, but by the end were "clinging to their lead like nervous kittens". After 27 games, the team stood in first position and had accumulated 67 points. They were nine points clear of both Chelsea and Manchester United.

Arsenal carried their good form into March; Henry and Pires scored in the defeat of Blackburn Rovers. It was a laboured performance from the league leaders, one which served a "…reminder of the old <a href="maxim%20%28philosophy%29">maxim</a> that championships are won by teams who can pick up points when they are not playing well." Arsenal then played Bolton Wanderers at home; Wenger made one change from the previous match – Bergkamp replaced Reyes upfront. The blustery conditions forced the game to be delayed by 15 minutes, approximately the same amount of time it took Pires to score Arsenal's opener. By the 24th minute, it was 2–0: Henry's cross found Bergkamp who shot the ball past <a href="Jussi%20J%C3%A4%C3%A4skel%C3%A4inen">Jussi Jääskeläinen</a> at the first attempt. Although Bolton's performance improved after scoring just before half time, the result was a ninth straight league win for Arsenal and kept them nine points clear at the top.

The visit of Manchester United on 28 March 2004 provided a stern test for Arsenal; it was both clubs' first meeting since the fiasco at Old Trafford. Cole, injured in the midweek Champions League game against Chelsea, was replaced by Clichy in the starting line-up, while Bergkamp was dropped for Reyes. Henry gave Arsenal the lead, with a long range shot that swerved past goalkeeper <a href="Roy%20Carroll">Roy Carroll</a>. With five minutes of the game left, <a href="Louis%20Saha">Louis Saha</a> evaded the Arsenal defence and scored the equaliser for Manchester United. Arsenal came close to a winner in injury time, only for Lauren to have his shot saved. The draw was no good for <a href="Alex%20Ferguson">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>, the manager of Manchester United, who afterwards conceded his team's chances: "They'll (Arsenal) go on to win the league now – I'm sure of that. They are playing with great determination … a very strong team, so should win the league really". In avoiding defeat, Arsenal set a new all-time league record of 30 matches unbeaten from the start of the season, originally held by Leeds and Liverpool. They remained in first position at the end of March and were seven points in front of Chelsea, with eight matches remaining.
After two cup exits in the space of a week, Arsenal faced Liverpool on <a href="Good%20Friday">Good Friday</a> at Highbury. Hyypiä opened the scoring for the visitors after five minutes, and in spite of Henry's equaliser just after the half-hour mark, Liverpool led again before the interval. Arsenal responded by scoring twice in a minute; Henry's second goal saw the player hold off <a href="Dietmar%20Hamann">Dietmar Hamann</a> in midfield, weave through defender <a href="Jamie%20Carragher">Jamie Carragher</a> and place the ball past <a href="Jerzy%20Dudek">Jerzy Dudek</a>. The striker completed his hat-trick in the 78th minute, after good work by Bergkamp. Liverpool manager <a href="G%C3%A9rard%20Houllier">Gérard Houllier</a> likened Arsenal to a "wounded animal" after the match and believed Henry was "the man who made the difference … he set the tempo". Arsenal played out a goalless draw with Newcastle United on <a href="Bank%20Holiday">Bank Holiday</a> Monday, and five days later faced Leeds United. On a night where Henry scored four goals and was described by his manager as "the best striker in the world", Arsenal moved to within two wins of regaining the league title.

With Chelsea unable to garner maximum points in their next two matches, Arsenal knew before their game away at Tottenham that a draw would guarantee their status as champions. Cole returned for the derby, after sitting out the Leeds match with an ankle injury. Arsenal took an early lead when Vieira finished off a counter-attacking move. Incisive football brought about the second goal, ten minutes before the break. Bergkamp passed the ball to Vieira, who cut it back for Pires to sidefoot. Tottenham replied in the second half by scoring twice – the equaliser a penalty – but it did not stop the Arsenal players celebrating at the final whistle "in front of their supporters' <a href="White%20Hart%20Lane">White Hart Lane</a> enclave". This marked the second time the club had been crowned league champions at their rivals' ground: the first time had been in 1971. Wenger praised his team for their success, telling the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>: "We've been remarkably consistent, haven't lost a game and we have played stylish football. We have entertained people who just love football."

In May, successive draws at home to Birmingham City and Portsmouth left Arsenal with 84 points from 36 games. Reyes scored the only goal of the match against Fulham; he profited from a mistake by goalkeeper <a href="Edwin%20van%20der%20Sar">Edwin van der Sar</a>: "The Dutchman tried to go past the Arsenal forward, but instead gifted possession and with it the easiest of open goals." Arsenal's final game of the league season was against Leicester City. They conceded the opening goal, but turned the match around in the second half through goals from Henry and Vieira. With 26 wins, 12 draws and no defeats, the team became the first since <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a> in <a href="1888%E2%80%9389%20Football%20League">1888–89</a> to go through a league season undefeated. Reviewing the match and overall season, Amy Lawrence of "The Observer" wrote: "Arsenal's achievement may not make them 'great' in everyone's opinion – those who define greatness only by European Cups, back-to-back titles, and triple cartwheels on the way to every goal – but it is staggering in its own right."

The FA Cup is English football's primary <a href="Single-elimination%20tournament">cup competition</a>. It was first held in <a href="1871%E2%80%9372%20FA%20Cup">1871–72</a> with only 15 teams entering; the growth of the sport and changes to the competition's structure meant that by 2000, more than 600 teams took part. Clubs in the Premier League enter the FA Cup in the third round and are drawn randomly out of a hat with the remaining clubs. If a match is drawn it is replayed, ordinarily at the ground of the team who were away for the first game. As with league fixtures, FA Cup matches are subject to change in the event of games being selected for television coverage and this often can be influenced by clashes with other competitions. In the case of Arsenal, all but one of their ties (fourth round) was televised to the British audience.

Arsenal entered the 2003–04 edition as holders of the cup. The team were undefeated in 14 cup ties since their 2–1 loss to Liverpool in the <a href="2001%20FA%20Cup%20Final">2001 FA Cup Final</a>, and aimed to win the competition for a third season in succession, something last achieved by Blackburn Rovers from 1884 to 1886. Henry believed Arsenal's good cup form showed they were "interested" in the competition and hoped their success would continue. The FA Cup was not high in Wenger's priority list – "The [Premier League] and the Champions League are more important," but he clarified this never meant Arsenal intended to neglect the competition: "You win what you can and go as far as you can."
Arsenal were drawn to face Leeds United away in the third round; the match was played on the first weekend of January. Wenger made six changes to the team which started at Southampton in the league, including Cole replacing Clichy at left-back after serving his three-match suspension. After eight minutes, Leeds went ahead when Lehmann's goal clearance hit striker <a href="Mark%20Viduka">Mark Viduka</a> and rebounded into the net. Arsenal equalised through Henry, who converted Ljungberg's cross from the right on a volley. Additional goals from Edu, Pires and Touré inflicted a third consecutive 4–1 defeat for Leeds against Arsenal at Elland Road. At home to Middlesbrough in the fourth round, Bergkamp opened the scoring for Arsenal, following good play from Parlour. <a href="Joseph-D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9%20Job">Joseph-Désiré Job</a> equalised for the away team four minutes after, but Ljungberg restored Arsenal's lead with a shot outside the penalty box and scored a second, direct from a corner. <a href="George%20Boateng">George Boateng</a> was sent off for the visitors in the 86th minute for two bookable offences and substitute <a href="David%20Bentley">David Bentley</a> added a fourth goal for Arsenal, chipping the ball over goalkeeper Schwarzer in the last minute of normal time.

In the fifth round, Arsenal played Chelsea at Highbury. Five minutes before the end of the first half, striker <a href="Adrian%20Mutu">Adrian Mutu</a> gave Chelsea the lead, with a shot from 20 yards. Reyes, who replaced Henry in the starting eleven for the tie, levelled the scoreline with a long range effort. He beat goalkeeper Sullivan for pace to score his second, which later proved to be the winning goal of the match. The quarter-final pitted Arsenal against Portsmouth at Fratton Park on 6 March 2004. Henry opened the scoring in the 25th minute and further goals from himself, Ljungberg and Touré secured the team's passage into the last four of the competition. Edu was singled out for praise by "The Guardian" correspondent <a href="Kevin%20McCarra">Kevin McCarra</a>, who enthused over the visitors' performance: "Arsenal echoed the <a href="AFC%20Ajax">Ajax</a> <a href="Total%20football">philosophy</a> as players swapped position and kept changing the point of attack before the mesmerised eyes of the opposition."

Manchester United were Arsenal's opponents for the semi-final, staged at <a href="Villa%20Park">Villa Park</a> on 3 April 2004. Both teams had settled for a draw in the league the previous Sunday, but given this was for a place in the final, the stakes were much higher. United defender <a href="Gary%20Neville">Gary Neville</a> described the game as his team's "most important" of the season after they were eliminated from the Champions League and he deemed them "too far behind" in the Premier League. Wenger rested Henry, mindful of the team's upcoming <a href="fixture%20congestion">fixture congestion</a>. Although Arsenal started the better of the two teams, it was United midfielder <a href="Paul%20Scholes">Paul Scholes</a> who scored the only goal of the game which ensured their progress into the final.

The <a href="EFL%20Cup">Football League Cup</a> is a cup competition open to clubs in the Premier League and Football League. Like the FA Cup it is played on a knockout basis, with the exception of the semi-finals, which are contested over a <a href="two-legged%20tie">two-legged tie</a>. Wenger's tenure at Arsenal has seen him use the competition to field younger and lesser known players, something he and Ferguson were initially criticised for in 1997. While Ferguson felt it was an unwanted distraction at the time, Wenger said: "If the competition wants to survive it must offer the incentive of a <a href="UEFA%20competitions">European place</a>." The winners of the League Cup in the 2003–04 season earnt entry into the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a>, unless they qualified for the UEFA Champions League through their league position. League Cup matches are subject to change in the event of games being selected for television coverage, inclement weather and potential competition clashes. All rounds up until the final are played in midweek.

Arsenal entered the League Cup in the third round and were drawn at home to <a href="Rotherham%20United%20F.C.">Rotherham United</a>. Wenger handed midfielder <a href="Cesc%20F%C3%A0bregas">Cesc Fàbregas</a> his debut at 16 years and 177 days; as of 2016 is still the youngest player to turn out for the club. Arsenal led from the 11th minute through an Aliadière goal, but conceded an equaliser late on which forced extra time. Rotherham goalkeeper <a href="Mike%20Pollitt">Mike Pollitt</a> was sent off for handling the ball outside his penalty area; his substitute <a href="Gary%20Montgomery">Gary Montgomery</a> denied Wiltord from scoring the winner. As there were no further goals, the match was decided on penalties which Arsenal won 9–8 in the shootout. Fellow divisional opponents Wolverhampton Wanderers were defeated 5–1 by Arsenal in the fourth round; Vieira, absent through injury in September and October, made his first team return and played the full match.

In the fifth round, Arsenal travelled to <a href="The%20Hawthorns">The Hawthorns</a> to play <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a>. Wenger added experience to the side to complement youth, with Parlour, Edu, Kanu and Keown all featuring. Arsenal took the lead in the 25th minute through Kanu. Lauren's cross from the right-hand side deflected in the direction of the striker. His header was saved by goalkeeper <a href="Russell%20Hoult">Russell Hoult</a>, who was unable to deny Kanu shooting the rebounded ball into the net. Aliadière scored Arsenal's second goal of the match following Hoult's poor clearance.

Arsenal exited the competition in the semi-finals against Middlesbrough. At Highbury, the setting for the first leg, <a href="Juninho%20Paulista">Juninho</a> scored the only goal of the tie. Arsenal's task of progressing was made more difficult after Keown was sent off in the second leg and <a href="Boudewijn%20Zenden">Boudewijn Zenden</a> doubled Middlesbrough's aggregate scoreline. Though Edu equalised for Arsenal on the night, Reyes' own goal earnt Middlesbrough the win. Wenger opined of the result: "I don't think we deserved to lose; even when we were down to 10 men we were running the game."

The UEFA Champions League is a continental club football competition organised by <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a>. Founded in the 1950s as the European Champion Clubs' Cup, the competition was open to champion clubs of each country and arranged as a straight knockout tournament. The growth of television rights saw the format rebranded in the 1990s to include a group stage and permit multiple entrants. Arsenal had qualified for every Champions League season since <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">1998–99</a>, but the club never progressed further than the quarter-final stage. Ahead of the new campaign, Wenger assessed his team needed to perform in the home games, adding: "We are mature enough now and we must add that little bit of sparkle to make the difference."

Arsenal were drawn in Group B, along with Italian club <a href="Inter%20Milan">Inter Milan</a>, <a href="FC%20Lokomotiv%20Moscow">Lokomotiv Moscow</a> of Russia and Ukraine's <a href="FC%20Dynamo%20Kyiv">Dynamo Kyiv</a>. Wenger believed the trips to Eastern Europe threatened his team's chances of winning the Premier League: "The other English teams have more comfortable groups than we do. It is tough to go to Russia – I always say that if you have to travel more than two hours it is difficult. Sometimes the players pay a high price in the games that follow the Champions League matches."

Arsenal opened their Champions League campaign with a 3–0 defeat against Inter Milan. Goals from <a href="Julio%20Ricardo%20Cruz">Julio Ricardo Cruz</a>, <a href="Andy%20van%20der%20Meyde">Andy van der Meyde</a> and <a href="Obafemi%20Martins">Obafemi Martins</a> all in the first half extended Arsenal's run of six home games in the competition without a win. Wenger said afterwards: "We can complain and cry the whole night but that will not change the result. The only thing we can do is to respond." The team, without Campbell and Vieira, earned a draw away to Lokomotiv Moscow, but remained bottom of the group. Arsenal lost to <a href="FC%20Dynamo%20Kyiv">Dynamo Kyiv</a> in late October; Wenger's decision to shift from his preferred <a href="4-4-2%20formation">4–4–2 formation</a> caused the team to play more narrow than usual. Cole scored the winning goal in the reverse fixture at Highbury. A cross by Wiltord was flicked on by Henry in the direction of an incoming Cole, who dived to head the ball past goalkeeper <a href="Oleksandr%20Shovkovskiy">Oleksandr Shovkovskiy</a>.

The team scored four goals in the second half against Inter Milan and won 5–1. Wenger felt the result showed there was "…a special mental strength in the team", while Cole compared it to <a href="2001%20Germany%20vs%20England%20football%20match">England's victory against Germany in 2001</a> but added "this was even better." Arsenal won 2–0 against Lokomotiv Moscow to top Group B. <a href="Jacob%20Lekgetho">Jacob Lekgetho</a>'s dismissal in the eighth minute meant the visitors played the remainder of the match with ten men.

Arsenal were paired up against <a href="Celta%20de%20Vigo">Celta Vigo</a> in the last 16 stage and the first leg was held at the <a href="Bala%C3%ADdos">Balaídos</a>. Although they conceded two goals from <a href="Set%20piece%20%28football%29">set pieces</a>, Arsenal scored three times to win the game which put the team in a favourable position given the <a href="away%20goals%20rule">away goals rule</a>. Their passage was secured with a 2–0 win on 10 March 2004; Henry scored both goals for the team.

In the quarter-finals, Arsenal met fellow English club Chelsea. The draw disappointed vice-chairman Dein: "One of the joys of playing in Europe is playing teams from overseas – and having played Chelsea three times, it is a bit anti-climactic." The first leg, played at Stamford Bridge ended in a draw with Guðjohnsen and Pires scoring for their respective clubs. Arsenal were unable to take advantage of <a href="Marcel%20Desailly">Marcel Desailly</a>'s dismissal in the second half, but Wenger felt his team were in a good position to progress: "Our main aim will be to win the game at Highbury and we know we can do that."

Henry, rested for the FA Cup semi-final match, started alongside Reyes for the second leg. It was the latter forward who gave Arsenal the lead in injury time of the first half, but <a href="Frank%20Lampard">Frank Lampard</a> equalised for Chelsea in the 51st minute. With three minutes remaining of the match, defender <a href="Wayne%20Bridge">Wayne Bridge</a> scored to eliminate Arsenal from the competition.

Arsenal used a total of 34 players during the 2003–04 season and there were 15 different goalscorers. There were also three squad members who did not make a first-team appearance in the campaign. The team played in a 4–4–2 formation throughout the season, with two wide midfielders. Touré featured in 55 matches – the most of any Arsenal player in the campaign and Lehmann started in all 38 league matches.

The team scored a total of 114 goals in all competitions. The highest scorer was Henry, with 39 goals, followed by Pires who scored 19 goals. Three of Arsenal's goals in the 2003–04 season (Henry against Manchester City and Liverpool, Vieira against Tottenham Hotspur) were shortlisted for <a href="BBC%20Goal%20of%20the%20Season">Goal of the Season</a> by viewers of <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a>'s "<a href="The%20Premiership%20%28TV%20series%29">The Premiership</a>". Five Arsenal players were sent off during the season: Jeffers, Vieira, Campbell, Cole and Keown.

"Numbers in parentheses denote appearances as <a href="substitute%20%28association%20football%29">substitute</a>. Players with name struck through and marked left the club during the playing season."

In recognition of the team's achievement, Wenger was awarded the <a href="Premier%20League%20Manager%20of%20the%20Season">Barclaycard Manager of the Year</a>. A spokesperson of the awards panel said of the decision: "Arsène Wenger is a very worthy recipient of this accolade and has sent his team into the history books. Arsenal have played exciting attacking football throughout the season and finishing it unbeaten is a feat that may not be repeated for another 100 years." Henry was given the accolade of <a href="PFA%20Players%27%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">PFA Players' Player of the Year</a> by his fellow peers and the <a href="FWA%20Footballer%20of%20the%20Year">FWA Footballer of the Year</a> by football writers for the second consecutive season. He came runner-up in both the <a href="2003%20FIFA%20World%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">2003 FIFA World Player of the Year</a> and the <a href="2003%20Ballon%20d%27Or">2003 Ballon d'Or</a>.

Three Arsenal players received the <a href="Premier%20League%20Player%20of%20the%20Month">Premier League Player of the Month</a> award – Henry twice in January and April 2004, and Bergkamp and Edu shared the accolade in February 2004 after the judges "felt it was appropriate that we make a joint award". Wenger was the <a href="Premier%20League%20Manager%20of%20the%20Month">Premier League Manager of the Month</a> in August 2003 and February 2004.

A day after the Leicester City match, Arsenal paraded the Premier League trophy on an open-top bus, in front of more than 250,000 fans. The victory parade commenced at Highbury and ended at <a href="Islington%20Town%20Hall">Islington Town Hall</a>. At the town hall balcony, Vieira addressed the crowd: "It has been a fantastic season. We achieved something unbelievable but we couldn't have done it without the fans." In an interview with the BBC, Dein added: "We've seen history made and I'd be surprised if it happens again. It's just been a privilege to watch Arsenal this season."

Arsenal's achievement of going through the league season unbeaten received considerable praise from those involved in football. <a href="Derek%20Shaw%20%28businessman%29">Derek Shaw</a>, the chairman of Preston offered his congratulations as they equalled his club's record of completing a league season without defeat, set <a href="1888%E2%80%9389%20Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.%20season">115 years previously</a>. Brazilian <a href="Roberto%20Carlos%20%28footballer%29">Roberto Carlos</a> likened Arsenal's style of play to "samba football" while <a href="Michel%20Platini">Michel Platini</a> applauded the team's "great flair and spirit". Former Arsenal manager <a href="George%20Graham%20%28footballer%29">George Graham</a> attributed the success to defensive improvements, since mistakes the previous season had proved costly and former striker <a href="Alan%20Smith%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201962%29">Alan Smith</a> felt the team were "certainly the best Highbury's ever seen". 
The British press unanimously praised Arsenal's feat once the season drew to a close; the "News of the World" branded the team as "Immortals", while "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>" led with the headline "Arsenal the New Invincibles". In an otherwise positive reflection of Arsenal's season, Glenn Moore wrote for "The Independent": "There may thus have been some truth in Arsène Wenger's declaration that Arsenal's achievement was a greater triumph than winning the Champions' League. Arsenal's prolonged celebrations reflected the scale of this landmark and yet, when they reflect in the summer break, how many players will agree with Wenger?".

A one-off golden replica trophy was commissioned by the Premier League thereafter; it was awarded to Arsenal before their first home game of the following season. The team eclipsed the league record of 42 matches without defeat (set by <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a>) against Blackburn Rovers and went seven more matches unbeaten until they lost – away to Manchester United in October 2004. Although Arsenal regained the FA Cup – <a href="2005%20FA%20Cup%20Final">on penalties against United</a> – they finished second to Chelsea in the league. The move to the Emirates Stadium in 2006 coincided with a transitional phase for the club. Several experienced first teamers were displaced in favour of youth and the style of football shifted more towards ball retention. Arsenal have since failed to regain the league title; they nevertheless remained a fixture in the Champions League under Wenger's stewardship in the years after.

The title win at White Hart Lane came third in a list of Arsenal's "Greatest 50 Moments", and the performance at the San Siro was ranked tenth. In 2012, the Arsenal team of 2003–04 won the "Best Team" category in the <a href="Premier%20League%2020%20Seasons%20Awards">Premier League 20 Seasons Awards</a>.

Maya civilization

The Maya civilization () was a <a href="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a>n <a href="civilization">civilization</a> developed by the <a href="Maya%20peoples">Maya peoples</a>, and noted for its <a href="Maya%20script">logosyllabic script</a>—the most sophisticated and highly developed <a href="writing%20system">writing system</a> in <a href="Pre-Columbian%20era">pre-Columbian</a> <a href="Americas">Americas</a>—as well as for its <a href="Maya%20art">art</a>, <a href="Maya%20architecture">architecture</a>, <a href="Maya%20numerals">mathematics</a>, <a href="Maya%20calendar">calendar</a>, and <a href="Maya%20astronomy">astronomical</a> system. The Maya civilization developed in an area that encompasses southeastern <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>, all of <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a> and <a href="Belize">Belize</a>, and the western portions of <a href="Honduras">Honduras</a> and <a href="El%20Salvador">El Salvador</a>. This region consists of the northern lowlands encompassing the <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20Peninsula">Yucatán Peninsula</a>, and the highlands of the <a href="Sierra%20Madre%20de%20Chiapas">Sierra Madre</a>, running from the Mexican state of <a href="Chiapas">Chiapas</a>, across southern <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a> and onwards into El Salvador, and the southern lowlands of the Pacific littoral plain.

The <a href="Mesoamerican%20chronology%23Archaic%20Era">Archaic period</a>, prior to 2000 BC, saw the first developments in agriculture and the earliest villages. The Preclassic period () saw the establishment of the first complex societies in the Maya region, and the cultivation of the staple crops of the <a href="Maya%20cuisine">Maya diet</a>, including <a href="maize">maize</a>, <a href="Phaseolus%20vulgaris">beans</a>, <a href="Cucurbita">squashes</a>, and <a href="chili%20pepper">chili pepper</a>s. The first <a href="Maya%20city">Maya cities</a> developed around 750 BC, and by 500 BC these cities possessed monumental architecture, including large temples with elaborate <a href="stucco">stucco</a> façades. Hieroglyphic writing was being used in the Maya region by the 3rd century BC. In the Late Preclassic a number of large cities developed in the <a href="Pet%C3%A9n%20Basin">Petén Basin</a>, and the city of <a href="Kaminaljuyu">Kaminaljuyu</a> rose to prominence in the <a href="Guatemalan%20Highlands">Guatemalan Highlands</a>. Beginning around 250 AD, the Classic period is largely defined as when the Maya were raising sculpted monuments with <a href="Mesoamerican%20Long%20Count%20calendar">Long Count dates</a>. This period saw the Maya civilization develop a large number of <a href="city-state">city-state</a>s linked by a complex <a href="Trade%20in%20Maya%20civilization">trade network</a>. In the Maya Lowlands two great rivals, the cities of <a href="Tikal">Tikal</a> and <a href="Calakmul">Calakmul</a>, became powerful. The Classic period also saw the intrusive intervention of the central Mexican city of <a href="Teotihuacan">Teotihuacan</a> in Maya dynastic politics. In the 9th century, there was a widespread <a href="Classic%20Maya%20collapse">political collapse</a> in the central Maya region, resulting in <a href="internecine%20war">internecine war</a>fare, the abandonment of cities, and a northward shift of population. The Postclassic period saw the rise of <a href="Chichen%20Itza">Chichen Itza</a> in the north, and the expansion of the aggressive <a href="K%CA%BCiche%CA%BC%20kingdom%20of%20Q%CA%BCumarkaj">Kʼicheʼ kingdom</a> in the Guatemalan Highlands. In the 16th century, the <a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spanish Empire</a> colonized the Mesoamerican region, and a lengthy series of campaigns saw the fall of <a href="Nojpet%C3%A9n">Nojpetén</a>, the last Maya city, in 1697.

Classic period rule was centred on the concept of the "divine king", who acted as a mediator between mortals and the supernatural realm. Kingship was <a href="patrilineal">patrilineal</a>, and power would normally <a href="primogeniture">pass to the eldest son</a>. A prospective king was also expected to be a successful war leader. Maya politics was dominated by a closed system of patronage, although the exact political make-up of a kingdom varied from city-state to city-state. By the Late Classic, the aristocracy had greatly increased, resulting in the corresponding reduction in the exclusive power of the divine king. The Maya civilization developed highly sophisticated artforms, and the Maya created art using both perishable and non-perishable materials, including wood, <a href="jade%20use%20in%20Mesoamerica">jade</a>, <a href="Obsidian%20use%20in%20Mesoamerica">obsidian</a>, <a href="Maya%20ceramics">ceramics</a>, sculpted stone monuments, stucco, and finely painted murals.

Maya cities tended to expand haphazardly, and the city centre would be occupied by ceremonial and administrative complexes, surrounded by an irregular sprawl of residential districts. Different parts of a city would often be linked by <a href="sacbe">causeways</a>. The principal architecture of the city consisted of palaces, <a href="Mesoamerican%20pyramids">pyramid-temples</a>, <a href="Mesoamerican%20ballcourt">ceremonial ballcourts</a>, and structures aligned for astronomical observation. The Maya elite were literate, and developed a complex system of hieroglyphic writing that was the most advanced in the pre-Columbian Americas. The Maya recorded their history and ritual knowledge in screenfold books, of which only three uncontested examples remain, the rest having been destroyed by the Spanish. There are also a great many examples of Maya text found on <a href="Maya%20stelae">stelae</a> and ceramics. The Maya developed a highly complex series of interlocking ritual calendars, and employed mathematics that included one of the earliest instances of the <a href="0%20%28number%29">explicit zero</a> in the world. As a part of their religion, the Maya practised <a href="human%20sacrifice%20in%20Maya%20culture">human sacrifice</a>.
The Maya civilization developed within the Mesoamerican cultural area, which covers a region that spreads from northern Mexico southwards into Central America. Mesoamerica was one of six <a href="cradle%20of%20civilization">cradles of civilization</a> worldwide. The Mesoamerican area gave rise to a series of cultural developments that included <a href="complex%20society">complex societies</a>, <a href="agriculture%20in%20Mesoamerica">agriculture</a>, cities, <a href="Mesoamerican%20architecture">monumental architecture</a>, <a href="Mesoamerican%20writing%20systems">writing</a>, and <a href="Mesoamerican%20calendars">calendrical systems</a>. The set of traits shared by Mesoamerican cultures also included <a href="Mesoamerican%20astronomy">astronomical knowledge</a>, <a href="Bloodletting%20in%20Mesoamerica">blood</a> and <a href="human%20sacrifice">human sacrifice</a>, and a <a href="Mesoamerican%20mythology">cosmovision</a> that viewed the world as divided into four divisions aligned with the <a href="cardinal%20direction">cardinal direction</a>s, each with different attributes, and a three-way division of the world into the celestial realm, the earth, and the underworld.

By 6000 BC, the early inhabitants of Mesoamerica were experimenting with the domestication of plants, a process that eventually led to the establishment of <a href="sedentism">sedentary</a> <a href="agrarian%20society">agricultural societies</a>. The diverse climate allowed for wide variation in available crops, but all regions of Mesoamerica cultivated the base crops of maize, beans, and squashes. All Mesoamerican cultures used <a href="Prehistoric%20technology">Stone Age technology</a>; after c. 1000 AD <a href="Metallurgy%20in%20pre-Columbian%20Mesoamerica">copper, silver and gold</a> were worked. Mesoamerica lacked <a href="draft%20animals">draft animals</a>, did not use the wheel, and possessed few domesticated animals; the principal means of transport was on foot or by canoe.
Mesoamericans viewed the world as hostile and governed by unpredictable deities. The <a href="Mesoamerican%20ballgame">ritual Mesoamerican ballgame</a> was widely played. Mesoamerica is linguistically diverse, with most <a href="Mesoamerican%20languages">languages</a> falling within a small number of <a href="language%20family">language families</a>—the major families are <a href="Mayan%20languages">Mayan</a>, <a href="Mixe%E2%80%93Zoque%20languages">Mixe–Zoquean</a>, <a href="Oto-Manguean%20languages">Otomanguean</a>, and <a href="Uto-Aztecan%20languages">Uto-Aztecan</a>; there are also a number of smaller families and <a href="language%20isolate">isolates</a>. The Mesoamerican <a href="language%20area">language area</a> shares a number of important features, including widespread <a href="loanword">loanword</a>s, and use of a <a href="vigesimal">vigesimal</a> number system.

The territory of the Maya covered a third of Mesoamerica, and the Maya were engaged in a dynamic relationship with neighbouring cultures that included the <a href="Olmec">Olmec</a>s, <a href="Mixtec">Mixtec</a>s, Teotihuacan, the <a href="Aztec">Aztec</a>s, and others. During the Early Classic period, the Maya cities of Tikal and Kaminaljuyu were key Maya foci in a network that extended beyond the Maya area into the highlands of central Mexico. At around the same time, there was a strong Maya presence at the Tetitla compound of Teotihuacan. Centuries later, during the 9th century AD, murals at <a href="Cacaxtla">Cacaxtla</a>, another site in the central Mexican highlands, were painted in a Maya style. This may have been either an effort to align itself with the still-powerful Maya area after the collapse of Teotihuacan and ensuing political fragmentation in the Mexican Highlands, or an attempt to express a distant Maya origin of the inhabitants. The Maya city of Chichen Itza and the distant <a href="Toltec">Toltec</a> capital of <a href="Tula%20%28Mesoamerican%20site%29">Tula</a> had an especially <a href="Maya-Toltec%20controversy%20at%20Chichen%20Itza">close relationship</a>.

The Maya civilization occupied a wide territory that included southeastern Mexico and northern Central America. This area included the entire Yucatán Peninsula and all of the territory now incorporated into the modern countries of Guatemala and Belize, as well as the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador. Most of the peninsula is formed by a vast plain with few hills or mountains and a generally low coastline.

The Petén region consists of densely forested low-lying limestone plain; a chain of fourteen lakes runs across the central drainage basin of Petén. To the south the plain gradually rises towards the Guatemalan Highlands. Dense forest covers northern Petén and Belize, most of <a href="Quintana%20Roo">Quintana Roo</a>, southern <a href="Campeche">Campeche</a>, and a portion of the south of <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n">Yucatán</a> state. Farther north, the vegetation turns to lower forest consisting of dense scrub.

The <a href="littoral%20zone">littoral zone</a> of <a href="Soconusco">Soconusco</a> lies to the south of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, and consists of a narrow coastal plain and the foothills of the Sierra Madre. The Maya highlands extend eastwards from Chiapas into Guatemala, reaching their highest in the <a href="Sierra%20de%20los%20Cuchumatanes">Sierra de los Cuchumatanes</a>. The major pre-Columbian population centres of the highlands were located in the largest highland valleys, such as the <a href="Valley%20of%20Guatemala">Valley of Guatemala</a> and the <a href="Quetzaltenango">Quetzaltenango</a> Valley. In the southern highlands, a belt of volcanic cones runs parallel to the Pacific coast. The highlands extend northwards into <a href="Verapaz%2C%20Guatemala">Verapaz</a>, and gradually descend to the east.

The history of Maya civilization is divided into three principal periods: the Preclassic, Classic, and Postclassic periods. These were preceded by the Archaic Period, during which the first settled villages and early developments in agriculture emerged. Modern scholars regard these periods as arbitrary divisions of Maya chronology, rather than indicative of cultural evolution or decline. Definitions of the start and end dates of period spans can vary by as much as a century, depending on the author.

The Maya developed their first civilization in the Preclassic period. Scholars continue to discuss when this era of Maya civilization began. Maya occupation at <a href="Cuello">Cuello</a> (modern-day Belize) has been carbon dated to around 2600 BC. Settlements were established around 1800 BC in the Soconusco region of the Pacific coast, and the Maya were already cultivating the staple crops of maize, beans, squash, and chili pepper. This period was characterized by <a href="sedentism">sedentary</a> communities and the introduction of pottery and fired clay figurines.

During the <a href="Mesoamerican%20chronology">Middle Preclassic Period</a>, small villages began to grow to form cities. <a href="Nakbe">Nakbe</a> in the Petén department of Guatemala is the earliest well-documented city in the Maya lowlands, where large structures have been dated to around 750 BC. The northern lowlands of Yucatán were widely settled by the Middle Preclassic. By approximately 400 BC, early Maya rulers were raising stelae. A developed script was already being used in Petén by the 3rd century BC. In the Late Preclassic Period, the enormous city of <a href="El%20Mirador">El Mirador</a> grew to cover approximately . Although not as large, Tikal was already a significant city by around 350 BC.

In the highlands, <a href="Kaminaljuyu">Kaminaljuyu</a> emerged as a principal centre in the Late Preclassic. <a href="Takalik%20Abaj">Takalik Abaj</a> and <a href="Chocol%C3%A1">Chocolá</a> were two of the most important cities on the Pacific coastal plain, and <a href="Komchen">Komchen</a> grew to become an important site in northern Yucatán. The Late Preclassic cultural florescence collapsed in the 1st century AD and many of the great Maya cities of the epoch were abandoned; the cause of this collapse is unknown.

The Classic period is largely defined as the period during which the lowland Maya raised dated monuments using the Long Count calendar. This period marked the peak of large-scale construction and <a href="urbanism">urbanism</a>, the recording of monumental inscriptions, and demonstrated significant intellectual and artistic development, particularly in the southern lowland regions. The Classic period Maya political landscape has been likened to that of <a href="Italian%20Renaissance">Renaissance Italy</a> or <a href="Classical%20Greece">Classical Greece</a>, with multiple city-states engaged in a complex network of alliances and enmities. The largest cities had populations numbering 50,000 to 120,000 and were linked to networks of subsidiary sites.

During the Early Classic, cities throughout the Maya region were influenced by the great metropolis of <a href="Teotihuacan">Teotihuacan</a> in the distant <a href="Valley%20of%20Mexico">Valley of Mexico</a>. In AD 378, Teotihuacan decisively intervened at Tikal and other nearby cities, deposed their rulers, and installed a new Teotihuacan-backed dynasty. This intervention was led by <a href="Siyaj%20K%CA%BCak%CA%BC">Siyaj Kʼakʼ</a> ("Born of Fire"), who arrived at Tikal in early 378. The king of Tikal, <a href="Chak%20Tok%20Ich%CA%BCaak%20I">Chak Tok Ichʼaak I</a>, died on the same day, suggesting a violent takeover. A year later, Siyaj Kʼakʼ oversaw the installation of a new king, <a href="Yax%20Nuun%20Ahiin%20I">Yax Nuun Ahiin I</a>. The installation of the new dynasty led to a period of political dominance when Tikal became the most powerful city in the central lowlands.

Tikal's great rival was Calakmul, another powerful city in the Petén Basin. Tikal and Calakmul both developed extensive systems of allies and vassals; lesser cities that entered one of these networks gained prestige from their association with the top-tier city, and maintained peaceful relations with other members of the same network. Tikal and Calakmul engaged in the manoeuvering of their alliance networks against each other. At various points during the Classic period, one or other of these powers would gain a strategic victory over its great rival, resulting in respective periods of florescence and decline.

In 629, <a href="B%CA%BCalaj%20Chan%20K%CA%BCawiil">Bʼalaj Chan Kʼawiil</a>, a son of the Tikal king <a href="K%CA%BCinich%20Muwaan%20Jol%20II">Kʼinich Muwaan Jol II</a>, was sent to found a new city at <a href="Dos%20Pilas">Dos Pilas</a>, in the <a href="Petexbat%C3%BAn%20Lake">Petexbatún</a> region, apparently as an outpost to extend Tikal's power beyond the reach of Calakmul. For the next two decades he fought loyally for his brother and overlord at Tikal. In 648, king <a href="Yuknoom%20Ch%CA%BCeen%20II">Yuknoom Chʼeen II</a> of Calakmul captured Balaj Chan Kʼawiil. Yuknoom Chʼeen II then reinstated Balaj Chan Kʼawiil upon the throne of Dos Pilas as his vassal. He thereafter served as a loyal ally of Calakmul.

In the southeast, <a href="Cop%C3%A1n">Copán</a> was the most important city. Its Classic-period dynasty was founded in 426 by <a href="K%CA%BCinich%20Yax%20K%CA%BCuk%CA%BC%20Mo%CA%BC">Kʼinich Yax Kʼukʼ Moʼ</a>. The new king had strong ties with central Petén and Teotihuacan. Copán reached the height of its cultural and artistic development during the rule of <a href="Uaxaclajuun%20Ub%CA%BCaah%20K%CA%BCawiil">Uaxaclajuun Ubʼaah Kʼawiil</a>, who ruled from 695 to 738. His reign ended catastrophically when he was captured by his vassal, king <a href="K%CA%BCak%CA%BC%20Tiliw%20Chan%20Yopaat">Kʼakʼ Tiliw Chan Yopaat</a> of <a href="Quirigu%C3%A1">Quiriguá</a>. The captured lord of Copán was taken back to Quiriguá and was decapitated in a public ritual. It is likely that this coup was backed by Calakmul, in order to weaken a powerful ally of Tikal. <a href="Palenque">Palenque</a> and <a href="Yaxchilan">Yaxchilan</a> were the most powerful cities in the <a href="Usumacinta%20River">Usumacinta</a> region. In the highlands, Kaminaljuyu in the Valley of Guatemala was already a sprawling city by 300. In the north of the Maya area, <a href="Coba">Coba</a> was the most important capital.

During the 9th century AD, the central Maya region suffered major political collapse, marked by the abandonment of cities, the ending of dynasties, and a northward shift in activity. No universally accepted theory explains this collapse, but it likely had a combination of causes, including endemic internecine warfare, overpopulation resulting in severe <a href="land%20degradation">environmental degradation</a>, and <a href="drought">drought</a>. During this period, known as the Terminal Classic, the northern cities of Chichen Itza and <a href="Uxmal">Uxmal</a> showed increased activity. Major cities in the northern Yucatán Peninsula continued to be inhabited long after the cities of the southern lowlands ceased to raise monuments.

Classic Maya social organization was based on the ritual authority of the ruler, rather than central control of trade and food distribution. This model of rulership was poorly structured to respond to changes, because the ruler's actions were limited by <a href="Traditional%20society">tradition</a> to such activities as construction, ritual, and warfare. This only served to exacerbate <a href="systemic%20problem">systemic problem</a>s. By the 9th and 10th centuries, this resulted in collapse of this system of rulership. In the northern Yucatán, individual rule was replaced by a ruling council formed from elite lineages. In the southern Yucatán and central Petén, kingdoms declined; in western Petén and some other areas, the changes were catastrophic and resulted in the rapid depopulation of cities. Within a couple of generations, large swathes of the central Maya area were all but abandoned. Both the capitals and their secondary centres were generally abandoned within a period of 50 to 100 years. One by one, cities stopped sculpting dated monuments; the last Long Count date was inscribed at <a href="Tonin%C3%A1">Toniná</a> in 909. Stelae were no longer raised, and squatters moved into abandoned royal palaces. Mesoamerican trade routes shifted and bypassed Petén.

Although much reduced, a significant Maya presence remained into the Postclassic period after the abandonment of the major Classic period cities; the population was particularly concentrated near permanent water sources. Unlike during previous cycles of contraction in the Maya region, abandoned lands were not quickly resettled in the Postclassic. Activity shifted to the northern lowlands and the Maya Highlands; this may have involved migration from the southern lowlands, because many Postclassic Maya groups had migration myths. Chichen Itza and its <a href="Puuc">Puuc</a> neighbours declined dramatically in the 11th century, and this may represent the final episode of Classic Period collapse. After the decline of Chichen Itza, the Maya region lacked a dominant power until the rise of the city of <a href="Mayapan">Mayapan</a> in the 12th century. New cities arose near the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> and <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf</a> coasts, and new trade networks were formed.

The Postclassic Period was marked by changes from the preceding Classic Period. The once-great city of Kaminaljuyu in the Valley of Guatemala was abandoned after continuous occupation of almost 2,000 years. Across the highlands and neighbouring Pacific coast, long-occupied cities in exposed locations were relocated, apparently due to a proliferation of <a href="Maya%20warfare">warfare</a>. Cities came to occupy more-easily defended hilltop locations surrounded by deep ravines, with ditch-and-wall defences sometimes supplementing the protection provided by the natural terrain. One of the most important cities in the Guatemalan Highlands at this time was <a href="Q%CA%BCumarkaj">Qʼumarkaj</a>, the capital of the aggressive <a href="K%CA%BCiche%CA%BC%20kingdom%20of%20Q%CA%BCumarkaj">Kʼicheʼ kingdom</a>. The government of Maya states, from the Yucatán to the Guatemalan highlands, was often organized as joint rule by a council. However, in practice one member of the council could act as a supreme ruler, while the other members served him as advisors.

Mayapan was abandoned around 1448, after a period of political, social and environmental turbulence that in many ways echoed the Classic period collapse in the <a href="Southern%20Maya%20area">southern Maya region</a>. The abandonment of the city was followed by a period of prolonged warfare, disease and natural disasters in the Yucatán Peninsula, which ended only shortly before Spanish contact in 1511. Even without a dominant regional capital, the early Spanish explorers reported wealthy coastal cities and thriving marketplaces. During the Late Postclassic, the Yucatán Peninsula was divided into a number of independent provinces that shared a common culture but varied in internal sociopolitical organization. On the eve of the Spanish conquest, the highlands of Guatemala were dominated by several powerful Maya states. The <a href="K%CA%BCiche%CA%BC%20people">Kʼicheʼ</a> had carved out a small empire covering a large part of the western Guatemalan Highlands and the neighbouring Pacific coastal plain. However, in the decades before the Spanish invasion the <a href="Kaqchikel%20kingdom">Kaqchikel kingdom</a> had been steadily eroding the kingdom of the Kʼicheʼ.

In 1511, a Spanish <a href="caravel">caravel</a> was wrecked in the Caribbean, and about a dozen survivors made landfall on the coast of Yucatán. They were seized by a Maya lord, and most were <a href="Human%20sacrifice%20in%20Maya%20culture">sacrificed</a>, although two managed to escape. From 1517 to 1519, three separate Spanish expeditions explored the Yucatán coast, and engaged in a number of battles with the Maya inhabitants. After the Aztec capital <a href="Tenochtitlan">Tenochtitlan</a> fell to the Spanish in 1521, <a href="Hern%C3%A1n%20Cort%C3%A9s">Hernán Cortés</a> despatched <a href="Pedro%20de%20Alvarado">Pedro de Alvarado</a> to Guatemala with 180 cavalry, 300 infantry, 4 cannons, and thousands of allied warriors from central Mexico; they arrived in Soconusco in 1523. The Kʼicheʼ capital, Qʼumarkaj, fell to Alvarado in 1524. Shortly afterwards, the Spanish were invited as allies into <a href="Iximche">Iximche</a>, the capital city of the Kaqchikel Maya. Good relations did not last, due to excessive Spanish demands for gold as tribute, and the city was abandoned a few months later. This was followed by the fall of <a href="Zaculeu">Zaculeu</a>, the Mam Maya capital, in 1525. <a href="Francisco%20de%20Montejo">Francisco de Montejo</a> and his son, <a href="Francisco%20de%20Montejo%20the%20Younger">Francisco de Montejo the Younger</a>, launched a long series of campaigns against the polities of the Yucatán Peninsula in 1527, and finally completed the conquest of the northern portion of the peninsula in 1546. This left only the Maya kingdoms of the Petén Basin independent. In 1697, <a href="Mart%C3%ADn%20de%20Urs%C3%BAa">Martín de Ursúa</a> launched an assault on the <a href="Itza%20people">Itza</a> capital <a href="Nojpet%C3%A9n">Nojpetén</a> and the last independent Maya city fell to the Spanish.

The Spanish conquest stripped away most of the defining features of Maya civilization. However, many Maya villages remained remote from Spanish colonial authority, and for the most part continued to manage their own affairs. Maya communities and the nuclear family maintained their traditional day-to-day life. The basic Mesoamerican diet of maize and beans continued, although agricultural output was improved by the introduction of steel tools. Traditional crafts such as weaving, ceramics, and basketry continued to be practised. Community markets and trade in local products continued long after the conquest. At times, the colonial administration encouraged the traditional economy in order to extract tribute in the form of ceramics or cotton textiles, although these were usually made to European specifications. Maya beliefs and language proved resistant to change, despite vigorous efforts by Catholic missionaries. The 260-day "<a href="tzolk%CA%BCin">tzolkʼin</a>" ritual calendar continues in use in modern Maya communities in the highlands of Guatemala and Chiapas, and millions of Mayan-language speakers inhabit the territory in which their ancestors developed their civilization.

The agents of the Catholic Church wrote detailed accounts of the Maya, in support of their efforts at evangelization, and absorption of the Maya into the Spanish Empire. This was followed by various Spanish priests and colonial officials who left descriptions of ruins they visited in Yucatán and Central America. In 1839, American traveller and writer <a href="John%20Lloyd%20Stephens">John Lloyd Stephens</a> set out to visit a number of Maya sites with English architect and draftsman <a href="Frederick%20Catherwood">Frederick Catherwood</a>. Their illustrated accounts of the ruins sparked strong popular interest, and brought the Maya to the attention of the world. The later 19th century saw the recording and recovery of ethnohistoric accounts of the Maya, and the first steps in deciphering Maya hieroglyphs.

The final two decades of the 19th century saw the birth of modern scientific archaeology in the Maya region, with the meticulous work of <a href="Alfred%20Maudslay">Alfred Maudslay</a> and <a href="Teoberto%20Maler">Teoberto Maler</a>. By the early 20th century, the <a href="Peabody%20Museum%20of%20Archaeology%20and%20Ethnology">Peabody Museum</a> was sponsoring excavations at Copán and in the Yucatán Peninsula. In the first two decades of the 20th century, advances were made in deciphering the Maya calendar, and identifying deities, dates, and religious concepts. Since the 1930s, archaeological exploration increased dramatically, with large-scale excavations across the Maya region.

In the 1960s, the distinguished Mayanist <a href="J.%20Eric%20S.%20Thompson">J. Eric S. Thompson</a> promoted the ideas that Maya cities were essentially vacant ceremonial centres serving a dispersed population in the forest, and that the Maya civilization was governed by peaceful astronomer-priests. These ideas began to collapse with major advances in the decipherment of the script in the late 20th century, pioneered by <a href="Heinrich%20Berlin">Heinrich Berlin</a>, <a href="Tatiana%20Proskouriakoff">Tatiana Proskouriakoff</a>, and <a href="Yuri%20Knorozov">Yuri Knorozov</a>. With breakthroughs in understanding of Maya script since the 1950s, the texts revealed the warlike activities of the Classic Maya kings, and the view of the Maya as peaceful could no longer be supported.

Unlike the <a href="Aztec">Aztec</a>s and the <a href="Inca%20Empire">Inca</a>, the Maya political system never integrated the entire Maya cultural area into a single state or empire. Rather, throughout its history, the Maya area contained a varying mix of political complexity that included both <a href="State%20%28polity%29">states</a> and <a href="chiefdom">chiefdom</a>s. These polities fluctuated greatly in their relationships with each other and were engaged in a complex web of rivalries, periods of dominance or submission, vassalage, and alliances. At times, different polities achieved regional dominance, such as Calakmul, <a href="Caracol">Caracol</a>, Mayapan, and Tikal. The first reliably evidenced polities formed in the Maya lowlands in the 9th century BC. During the Late Preclassic, the Maya political system coalesced into a <a href="theocracy">theopolitical</a> form, where elite ideology justified the ruler's authority, and was reinforced by public display, ritual, and religion. The divine king was the centre of political power, exercising ultimate control over the administrative, economic, judicial, and military functions of the polity. The divine authority invested within the ruler was such that the king was able to mobilize both the aristocracy and commoners in executing huge infrastructure projects, apparently with no police force or standing army. Some polities engaged in a strategy of increasing administration, and filling administrative posts with loyal supporters rather than blood relatives. Within a polity, mid-ranking population centres would have played a key role in managing resources and internal conflict.

The Maya political landscape was highly complex and Maya elites engaged in political intrigue to gain economic and social advantage over neighbours. In the Late Classic, some cities established a long period of dominance over other large cities, such as the dominance of Caracol over <a href="Naranjo">Naranjo</a> for half a century. In other cases, loose alliance networks were formed around a dominant city. Border settlements, usually located about halfway between neighbouring capitals, often switched allegiance over the course of their history, and at times acted independently. Dominant capitals exacted tribute in the form of luxury items from subjugated population centres. Political power was reinforced by military power, and the capture and humiliation of enemy warriors played an important part in elite culture. An overriding sense of pride and honour among the warrior aristocracy could lead to extended feuds and vendettas, which caused political instability and the fragmentation of polities.

From the Early Preclassic, Maya society was sharply divided between the elite and commoners. As population increased over time, various sectors of society became increasingly specialized, and political organization became increasingly complex. By the Late Classic, when populations had grown enormously and hundreds of cities were connected in a complex web of political hierarchies, the wealthy segment of society multiplied. A middle class may have developed that included artisans, low ranking <a href="Maya%20priesthood">priests</a> and officials, merchants, and soldiers. Commoners included farmers, servants, labourers, and slaves. According to indigenous histories, land was held communally by noble houses or <a href="clan">clan</a>s. Such clans held that the land was the property of the clan ancestors, and such ties between the land and the ancestors were reinforced by the burial of the dead within residential compounds.

Classic Maya rule was centred in a royal culture that was displayed in all areas of Classic Maya art. The king was the supreme ruler and held a semi-divine status that made him the mediator between the mortal realm and that of the gods. From very early times, kings were specifically identified with the <a href="Maya%20maize%20god">young maize god</a>, whose gift of maize was the basis of Mesoamerican civilization. Maya royal succession was <a href="patrilineality">patrilineal</a>, and royal power only passed to <a href="Women%20rulers%20in%20Maya%20society">queens</a> when doing otherwise would result in the extinction of the dynasty. Typically, power was passed to the eldest son. A young prince was called a "chʼok" ("youth"), although this word later came to refer to nobility in general. The royal heir was called "bʼaah chʼok" ("head youth"). Various points in the young prince's <a href="Childhood%20in%20Maya%20society">childhood</a> were marked by ritual; the most important was a bloodletting ceremony at age five or six years. Although being of the royal bloodline was of utmost importance, the heir also had to be a successful war leader, as demonstrated by taking of captives. The enthronement of a new king was a highly elaborate ceremony, involving a series of separate acts that included enthronement upon a <a href="jaguars%20in%20Mesoamerican%20cultures">jaguar-skin</a> cushion, human sacrifice, and receiving the symbols of royal power, such as a headband bearing a jade representation of the so-called "<a href="Maya%20jester%20god">jester god</a>", an elaborate headdress adorned with <a href="quetzal">quetzal</a> feathers, and a sceptre representing the god <a href="K%CA%BCawiil">Kʼawiil</a>.

Maya political administration, based around the royal court, was not bureaucratic in nature. Government was hierarchical, and official posts were sponsored by higher-ranking members of the aristocracy; officials tended to be promoted to higher levels of office during the course of their lives. Officials are referred to as being "owned" by their sponsor, and this relationship continued even after the death of the sponsor. The Maya royal court was a vibrant and dynamic political institution. There was no universal structure for the Maya royal court, instead each polity formed a royal court that was suited to its own individual context. A number of royal and noble titles have been identified by <a href="epigrapher">epigrapher</a>s translating Classic Maya inscriptions. "<a href="Ajaw">Ajaw</a>" is usually translated as "lord" or "king". In the Early Classic, an "ajaw" was the ruler of a city. Later, with increasing social complexity, the "ajaw" was a member of the ruling class and a major city could have more than one, each ruling over different districts. Paramount rulers distinguished themselves from the extended nobility by prefixing the word "kʼuhul" to their "ajaw" title. A "kʼuhul ajaw" was "divine lord", originally confined to the kings of the most prestigious and ancient royal lines. "Kalomte" was a royal title, whose exact meaning is not yet deciphered, but it was held only by the most powerful kings of the strongest dynasties. It indicated an overlord, or <a href="high%20king">high king</a>, and the title was only in use during the Classic period. By the Late Classic, the absolute power of the "kʼuhul ajaw" had weakened, and the political system had diversified to include a wider aristocracy, that by this time may well have expanded disproportionately.
A "sajal" was ranked below the "ajaw", and indicated a subservient lord. A "sajal" would be lord of a second- or third-tier site, answering to an "ajaw", who may himself have been subservient to a "kalomte". A "sajal" would often be a war captain or regional governor, and inscriptions often link the "sajal" title to warfare; they are often mentioned as the holders of war captives. "Sajal" meant "feared one". The titles of "ah tzʼihb" and "ah chʼul hun" are both related to scribes. The "ah tzʼihb" was a royal scribe, usually a member of the royal family; the "ah chʼul hun" was the Keeper of the Holy Books, a title that is closely associated with the "ajaw" title, indicating that an "ajaw" always held the "ah chʼul hun" title simultaneously. Other courtly titles, the functions of which are not well understood, were "yajaw kʼahk"' ("Lord of Fire"), "tiʼhuun" and "ti'sakhuun". These last two may be variations on the same title, and Mark Zender has suggested that the holder of this title may have been the spokesman for the ruler. Courtly titles are overwhelmingly male-oriented, and in those relatively rare occasions where they are applied to a woman, they appear to be used as honorifics for female royalty. Titled elites were often associated with particular structures in the hieroglyphic inscriptions of Classic period cities, indicating that such office holders either owned that structure, or that the structure was an important focus for their activities. A "lakam" was possibly the only non-elite post-holder in the royal court. The "lakam" was only found in larger sites, and they appear to have been responsible for the taxation of local districts.

Different factions may have existed in the royal court. The "kʼuhul ahaw" and his household would have formed the central power-base, but other important groups were the priesthood, the warrior aristocracy, and other aristocratic courtiers. Where ruling councils existed, as at Chichen Itza and Copán, these may have formed an additional faction. Rivalry between different factions would have led to dynamic political institutions as compromises and disagreements were played out. In such a setting, public performance was vital. Such performances included <a href="Maya%20dance">ritual dances</a>, presentation of war captives, offerings of tribute, human sacrifice, and religious ritual.

Commoners are estimated to have comprised over 90% of the population, but relatively little is known about them. Their houses were generally constructed from perishable materials, and their remains have left little trace in the archaeological record. Some commoner dwellings were raised on low platforms, and these can be identified, but an unknown quantity of commoner houses were not. Such low-status dwellings can only be detected by extensive <a href="Remote%20sensing%20%28archaeology%29">remote-sensing</a> surveys of apparently empty terrain. The range of commoners was broad; it consisted of everyone not of noble birth, and therefore included everyone from the poorest farmers to wealthy craftsmen and commoners appointed to bureaucratic positions. Commoners engaged in essential production activities, including that of products destined for use by the elite, such as <a href="cotton">cotton</a> and <a href="cocoa%20bean">cacao</a>, as well as subsistence crops for their own use, and utilitarian items such as ceramics and stone tools. Commoners took part in warfare, and could advance socially by proving themselves as outstanding warriors. Commoners paid taxes to the elite in the form of staple goods such as maize flour and game. It is likely that hard-working commoners who displayed exceptional skills and initiative could become influential members of Maya society.

Warfare was prevalent in the Maya world. Military campaigns were launched for a variety of reasons, including the control of trade routes and tribute, raids to take captives, scaling up to the complete destruction of an enemy state. Little is known about Maya military organization, logistics, or training. Warfare is depicted in Maya art from the Classic period, and wars and victories are mentioned in hieroglyphic inscriptions. Unfortunately, the inscriptions do not provide information upon the causes of war, or the form it took. In the 8th–9th centuries, intensive warfare resulted in the collapse of the kingdoms of the Petexbatún region of western Petén. The rapid abandonment of <a href="Aguateca">Aguateca</a> by its inhabitants has provided a rare opportunity to examine the remains of Maya weaponry "in situ". Aguateca was stormed by unknown enemies around 810 AD, who overcame its formidable defences and burned the royal palace. The elite inhabitants of the city either fled or were captured, and never returned to collect their abandoned property. The inhabitants of the periphery abandoned the site soon after. This is an example of intensive warfare carried out by an enemy in order to completely eliminate a Maya state, rather than subjugate it. Research at Aguateca indicated that Classic period warriors were primarily members of the elite.

From as early as the Preclassic period, the ruler of a Maya polity was expected to be a distinguished war leader, and was depicted with <a href="Human%20trophy%20taking%20in%20Mesoamerica">trophy heads</a> hanging from his belt. In the Classic period, such trophy heads no longer appeared on the king's belt, but Classic period kings are frequently depicted standing over humiliated war captives. Right up to the end of the Postclassic period, Maya kings led as war captains. Maya inscriptions from the Classic show that a defeated king could be captured, tortured, and sacrificed. The Spanish recorded that Maya leaders kept track of troop movements in painted books.

The outcome of a successful military campaign could vary in its impact on the defeated polity. In some cases, entire cities were sacked, and never resettled, as at Aguateca. In other instances, the victors would seize the defeated rulers, their families, and patron gods. The captured nobles and their families could be imprisoned, or sacrificed. At the least severe end of the scale, the defeated polity would be obliged to pay tribute to the victor.

During the Contact period, it is known that certain military positions were held by members of the aristocracy, and were passed on by patrilineal succession. It is likely that the specialized knowledge inherent in the particular military role was taught to the successor, including strategy, ritual, and war dances. Maya armies of the Contact period were highly disciplined, and warriors participated in regular training exercises and drills; every able-bodied adult male was available for military service. Maya states did not maintain standing armies; warriors were mustered by local officials who reported back to appointed warleaders. There were also units of full-time mercenaries who followed permanent leaders. Most warriors were not full-time, however, and were primarily farmers; the needs of their crops usually came before warfare. Maya warfare was not so much aimed at destruction of the enemy as the seizure of captives and plunder.

There is some evidence from the Classic period that women provided supporting roles in war, but they did not act as military officers with the exception of those rare ruling queens. By the Postclassic, the native chronicles suggest that women occasionally fought in battle.

The "<a href="atlatl">atlatl</a>" (spear-thrower) was introduced to the Maya region by Teotihuacan in the Early Classic. This was a stick with a notched end to hold a <a href="dart%20%28missile%29">dart</a> or <a href="javelin">javelin</a>. The stick was used to launch the missile with more force and accuracy than could be accomplished by simply hurling it with the arm alone. Evidence in the form of stone blade points recovered from Aguateca indicate that darts and spears were the primary weapons of the Classic Maya warrior. Commoners used <a href="blowgun">blowgun</a>s in war, which also served as their hunting weapon. The <a href="bow%20and%20arrow">bow and arrow</a> is another weapon that was used by the ancient Maya for both war and hunting. Although present in the Maya region during the Classic period, its use as a weapon of war was not favoured; it did not become a common weapon until the Postclassic. The Contact period Maya also used two-handed swords crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset obsidian, similar to the Aztec "<a href="macuahuitl">macuahuitl</a>". Maya warriors wore body armour in the form of quilted cotton that had been soaked in salt water to toughen it; the resulting armour compared favourably to the steel armour worn by the Spanish when they conquered the region. Warriors bore wooden or animal hide shields decorated with feathers and animal skins.

Trade was a key component of Maya society, and in the development of the Maya civilization. The cities that grew to become the most important usually controlled access to vital trade goods, or portage routes. Cities such as Kaminaljuyu and Qʼumarkaj in the Guatemalan Highlands, and <a href="Tazumal">Chalchuapa</a> in El Salvador, variously controlled access to the sources of obsidian at different points in Maya history. The most important cities in the northern Yucatán Peninsula controlled access to the sources of salt. In the Postclassic, the Maya engaged in a flourishing <a href="Slavery%20among%20the%20indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">slave trade</a> with wider Mesoamerica.

The Maya engaged in long distance trade across the Maya region, and across greater Mesoamerica and beyond. As an illustration, an Early Classic Maya merchant quarter has been identified at the distant metropolis of Teotihuacan, in central Mexico. Within Mesoamerica beyond the Maya area, trade routes particularly focused on central Mexico and the Gulf coast. In the Early Classic, Chichen Itza was at the hub of an extensive trade network that imported gold discs from <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a> and <a href="Panama">Panama</a>, and <a href="turquoise">turquoise</a> from <a href="Los%20Cerrillos%2C%20New%20Mexico">Los Cerrillos, New Mexico</a>. Long distance trade of both luxury and utilitarian goods was probably controlled by the royal family. Prestige goods obtained by trade were used both for consumption by the city's ruler, and as luxury gifts to consolidate the loyalty of vassals and allies.

Trade routes not only supplied physical goods, they facilitated the movement of people and ideas throughout Mesoamerica. Shifts in trade routes occurred with the rise and fall of important cities in the Maya region, and have been identified in every major reorganization of the Maya civilization, such as the rise of Preclassic Maya civilization, the transition to the Classic, and the Terminal Classic collapse. Even the Spanish Conquest did not immediately terminate all Maya trading activity; for example, the Contact period <a href="Manche%20Ch%CA%BCol">Manche Chʼol</a> traded the prestige crops of cacao, <a href="annatto">annatto</a> and <a href="vanilla">vanilla</a> into colonial Verapaz.

Little is known of Maya merchants, although they are depicted on Maya ceramics in elaborate noble dress. From this, it is known that at least some traders were members of the elite. During the Contact period, it is known that Maya nobility took part in long distance trading expeditions. The majority of traders were middle class, but were largely engaged in local and regional trade rather than the prestigious long distance trading that was the preserve of the elite. The travelling of merchants into dangerous foreign territory was likened to a passage through the <a href="Xibalba">underworld</a>; the patron deities of merchants were two <a href="Maya%20death%20gods">underworld gods</a> carrying backpacks. When merchants travelled, they painted themselves black, like their patron gods, and went heavily armed.

The Maya had no pack animals, so all trade goods were carried on the backs of porters when going overland; if the trade route followed a river or the coast, then goods were transported in canoes. A substantial Maya trading canoe was encountered off Honduras on <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>'s <a href="Fourth%20voyage%20of%20Christopher%20Columbus">fourth voyage</a>. It was made from a large hollowed-out tree trunk and had a palm-covered canopy. The canoe was broad and was powered by 25 rowers. Trade goods carried included cacao, obsidian, ceramics, textiles, food and drink for the crew, and copper bells and axes. Cacao was used as currency (although not exclusively), and its value was such that counterfeiting occurred by removing the flesh from the pod, and stuffing it with dirt or <a href="avocado">avocado</a> rind.

Marketplaces are difficult to identify archaeologically. However, the Spanish reported a thriving <a href="market%20economy">market economy</a> when they arrived in the region. At some Classic period cities, archaeologists have tentatively identified formal arcade-style masonry architecture and parallel alignments of scattered stones as the permanent foundations of market stalls. A 2007 study analysed soils from a modern Guatemalan market and compared the results with those obtained from analysis at a proposed ancient market at <a href="Chunchucmil">Chunchucmil</a>. Unusually high levels of <a href="zinc">zinc</a> and <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a> at both sites indicated similar food production and vegetable sales activity. The calculated density of market stalls at Chunchucmil strongly suggests that a thriving market economy already existed in the Early Classic. Archaeologists have tentatively identified marketplaces at an increasing number of Maya cities by means of a combination of archaeology and soil analysis. When the Spanish arrived, Postclassic cities in the highlands had markets in permanent plazas, with officials on hand to settle disputes, enforce rules, and collect taxes.

Maya art is essentially the art of the royal court. It is almost exclusively concerned with the Maya elite and their world. Maya art was crafted from both perishable and non-perishable materials, and served to link the Maya to their ancestors. Although surviving Maya art represents only a small proportion of the art that the Maya created, it represents a wider variety of subjects than any other art tradition in the Americas. Maya art has many regional <a href="Style%20%28visual%20arts%29">styles</a>, and is unique in the ancient Americas in bearing narrative text. The finest surviving Maya art dates to the Late Classic period.

The Maya exhibited a preference for the colour green or blue-green, and used the same word for the colours blue and green. Correspondingly, they placed high value on apple-green jade, and other <a href="Greenstone%20%28archaeology%29">greenstones</a>, associating them with the sun-god <a href="Kinich%20Ahau">Kʼinich Ajau</a>. They sculpted artefacts that included fine <a href="tessera">tessera</a>e and beads, to carved heads weighing . The Maya nobility practised <a href="Human%20tooth%20sharpening">dental modification</a>, and some lords wore encrusted jade in their teeth. Mosaic funerary masks could also be fashioned from jade, such as that of <a href="K%CA%BCinich%20Janaab%CA%BC%20Pakal">Kʼinich Janaabʼ Pakal</a>, king of Palenque.
Maya stone sculpture emerged into the archaeological record as a fully developed tradition, suggesting that it may have evolved from a tradition of sculpting wood. Because of the biodegradability of wood, the corpus of Maya woodwork has almost entirely disappeared. The few wooden artefacts that have survived include three-dimensional sculptures, and hieroglyphic panels. Stone <a href="Maya%20stelae">Maya stelae</a> are widespread in city sites, often paired with low, circular stones referred to as altars in the literature. Stone sculpture also took other forms, such as the limestone <a href="relief">relief</a> panels at Palenque and <a href="Piedras%20Negras%20%28Maya%20site%29">Piedras Negras</a>. At Yaxchilan, Dos Pilas, Copán, and other sites, stone stairways were decorated with sculpture. The hieroglyphic stairway at Copán comprises the longest surviving Maya hieroglyphic text, and consists of 2,200 individual glyphs.

The largest Maya sculptures consisted of architectural façades crafted from stucco. The rough form was laid out on a plain plaster base coating on the wall, and the three-dimensional form was built up using small stones. Finally, this was coated with stucco and moulded into the finished form; human body forms were first modelled in stucco, with their costumes added afterwards. The final stucco sculpture was then brightly painted. Giant stucco masks were used to adorn temple façades by the Late Preclassic, and such decoration continued into the Classic period.

The Maya had a long tradition of mural painting; rich polychrome murals have been excavated at San Bartolo, dating to between 300 and 200 BC. Walls were coated with plaster, and polychrome designs were painted onto the smooth finish. The majority of such murals have not survived, but Early Classic tombs painted in cream, red, and black have been excavated at Caracol, <a href="R%C3%ADo%20Azul">Río Azul</a>, and Tikal. Among the best preserved murals are a full-size series of Late Classic paintings at <a href="Bonampak">Bonampak</a>.
<a href="Flint">Flint</a>, <a href="chert">chert</a>, and obsidian all served utilitarian purposes in Maya culture, but many pieces were finely crafted into forms that were never intended to be used as tools. <a href="Eccentric%20flint%20%28archaeology%29">Eccentric flints</a> are among the finest lithic artefacts produced by the ancient Maya. They were technically very challenging to produce, requiring considerable skill on the part of the artisan. Large obsidian eccentrics can measure over in length. Their actual form varies considerably but they generally depict human, animal and geometric forms associated with <a href="Maya%20religion">Maya religion</a>. Eccentric flints show a great variety of forms, such as crescents, crosses, snakes, and scorpions. The largest and most elaborate examples display multiple human heads, with minor heads sometimes branching off from larger one.

Maya textiles are very poorly represented in the archaeological record, although by comparison with other pre-Columbian cultures, such as the Aztecs and the <a href="Andean%20civilizations">Andean region</a>, it is likely that they were high-value items. A few scraps of textile have been recovered by archaeologists, but the best evidence for textile art is where they are represented in other media, such as painted murals or ceramics. Such secondary representations show the elite of the Maya court adorned with sumptuous cloths, generally these would have been cotton, but <a href="North%20American%20jaguar">jaguar</a> pelts and deer hides are also shown.
Ceramics are the most commonly surviving type of Maya art. The Maya had no knowledge of the <a href="potter%27s%20wheel">potter's wheel</a>, and Maya vessels were built up by <a href="Coiling%20%28pottery%29">coiling rolled strips</a> of clay into the desired form. Maya pottery was not glazed, although it often had a fine finish produced by burnishing. Maya ceramics were painted with clay <a href="slip%20%28ceramics%29">slips</a> blended with minerals and coloured clays. Ancient Maya <a href="Pottery%23firing">firing techniques</a> have yet to be replicated. A quantity of extremely fine ceramic figurines have been excavated from Late Classic tombs on <a href="Jaina%20Island">Jaina Island</a>, in northern Yucatán. They stand from high and were hand modelled, with exquisite detail. The <a href="Ik-style%20ceramics">"Ik"-style</a> polychrome ceramic corpus, including finely painted plates and cylindrical vessels, originated in Late Classic Motul de San José. It includes a set of features such as hieroglyphs painted in a pink or pale red colour and scenes with dancers wearing masks. One of the most distinctive features is the realistic representation of subjects as they appeared in life. The subject matter of the vessels includes courtly life from the Petén region in the 8th century AD, such as diplomatic meetings, feasting, bloodletting, scenes of warriors and the sacrifice of prisoners of war.

Bone, both human and animal, was also sculpted; human bones may have been trophies, or relics of ancestors. The Maya valued <a href="Spondylus">Spondylus</a> shells, and worked them to remove the white exterior and spines, to reveal the fine orange interior. Around the 10th century AD, metallurgy arrived in Mesoamerica from South America, and the Maya began to make small objects in gold, silver and copper. The Maya generally hammered sheet metal into objects such as beads, bells, and discs. In the last centuries before the Spanish Conquest, the Maya began to use the <a href="Lost-wax%20casting">lost-wax method</a> to <a href="casting">cast</a> small metal pieces.

One poorly studied area of Maya <a href="folk%20art">folk art</a> is <a href="Ancient%20Maya%20graffiti">graffiti</a>. Additional graffiti, not part of the planned decoration, was incised into the stucco of interior walls, floors, and benches, in a wide variety of buildings, including temples, residences, and storerooms. Graffiti has been recorded at 51 Maya sites, particularly clustered in the Petén Basin and southern Campeche, and the <a href="Chenes%20%28Maya%20architecture%29">Chenes</a> region of northwestern Yucatán. At Tikal, where a great quantity of graffiti has been recorded, the subject matter includes drawings of temples, people, deities, animals, banners, litters, and thrones. Graffiti was often inscribed haphazardly, with drawings overlapping each other, and display a mix of crude, untrained art, and examples by artists who were familiar with Classic-period artistic conventions.
The Maya produced a vast array of structures, and have left an extensive architectural legacy. Maya architecture also incorporates various art forms and hieroglyphic texts. Masonry architecture built by the Maya evidences craft specialization in Maya society, centralized organization and the political means to mobilize a large workforce. It is estimated that a large elite residence at Copán required an estimated 10,686 <a href="man-hour">man-days</a> to build, which compares to 67-man-days for a commoner's hut. It is further estimated that 65% of the labour required to build the noble residence was used in the quarrying, transporting, and finishing of the stone used in construction, and 24% of the labour was required for the manufacture and application of limestone-based plaster. Altogether, it is estimated that two to three months were required for the construction of the residence for this single noble at Copán, using between 80 and 130 full-time labourers. A Classic-period city like Tikal was spread over , with an urban core covering . The labour required to build such a city was immense, running into many millions of man-days. The most massive structures ever erected by the Maya were built during the Preclassic period. Craft specialization would have required dedicated stonemasons and plasterers by the Late Preclassic, and would have required planners and architects.

Maya cities were not formally planned, and were subject to irregular expansion, with the haphazard addition of palaces, temples and other buildings. Most Maya cities tended to grow outwards from the core, and upwards as new structures were superimposed upon preceding architecture. Maya cities usually had a ceremonial and administrative centre surrounded by a vast irregular sprawl of residential complexes. The centres of all Maya cities featured sacred precincts, sometimes separated from nearby residential areas by walls. These precincts contained pyramid temples and other monumental architecture dedicated to elite activities, such as basal platforms that supported administrative or elite residential complexes. Sculpted monuments were raised to record the deeds of the ruling dynasty. City centres also featured plazas, sacred ballcourts and buildings used for marketplaces and schools. Frequently causeways linked the centre to outlying areas of the city. Some of these classes of architecture formed lesser groups in the outlying areas of the city, which served as sacred centres for non-royal lineages. The areas adjacent to these sacred compounds included residential complexes housing wealthy lineages. The largest and richest of these elite compounds sometimes possessed sculpture and art of craftsmanship equal to that of royal art.

The ceremonial centre of the Maya city was where the ruling elite lived, and where the administrative functions of the city were performed, together with religious ceremonies. It was also where the inhabitants of the city gathered for public activities. Elite residential complexes occupied the best land around the city centre, while commoners had their residences dispersed further away from the ceremonial centre. Residential units were built on top of stone platforms to raise them above the level of the rain season floodwaters.

The Maya built their cities with <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> technology; they built their structures from both perishable materials and from stone. The exact type of stone used in masonry construction varied according to locally available resources, and this also affected the building style. Across a broad swathe of the Maya area, limestone was immediately available. The local limestone is relatively soft when freshly cut, but hardens with exposure. There was great variety in the quality of limestone, with good-quality stone available in the Usumacinta region; in the northern Yucatán, the limestone used in construction was of relatively poor quality. Volcanic <a href="tuff">tuff</a> was used at Copán, and nearby Quiriguá employed <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>. In <a href="Comalcalco">Comalcalco</a>, where suitable stone was not available locally, <a href="Brick%23Fired%20brick">fired bricks</a> were employed. Limestone was burned at high temperatures in order to manufacture cement, plaster, and stucco. Lime-based cement was used to seal stonework in place, and stone blocks were fashioned using rope-and-water abrasion, and with obsidian tools. The Maya did not employ a functional wheel, so all loads were transported on litters, barges, or rolled on logs. Heavy loads were lifted with rope, but probably without employing pulleys.

Wood was used for beams, and for <a href="lintel">lintel</a>s, even in masonry structures. Throughout Maya history, common huts and some temples continued to be built from wooden poles and thatch. <a href="Adobe">Adobe</a> was also applied; this consisted of mud strengthened with straw and was applied as a coating over the woven-stick walls of huts. Like wood and thatch, adobe was used throughout Maya history, even after the development of masonry structures. In the southern Maya area, adobe was employed in monumental architecture when no suitable stone was locally available.

The great cities of the Maya civilization were composed of pyramid temples, palaces, ballcourts, "<a href="sacbe">sacbe</a>ob" (causeways), patios and plazas. Some cities also possessed extensive hydraulic systems or defensive walls. The exteriors of most buildings were painted, either in one or multiple colours, or with imagery. Many buildings were adorned with sculpture or painted stucco reliefs.

These complexes were usually located in the site core, beside a principal plaza. Maya palaces consisted of a platform supporting a multiroom range structure. The term "<a href="acropolis">acropolis</a>", in a Maya context, refers to a complex of structures built upon platforms of varying height. Palaces and acropoleis were essentially elite residential compounds. They generally extended horizontally as opposed to the towering Maya pyramids, and often had restricted access. Some structures in Maya acropoleis supported <a href="roof%20comb">roof comb</a>s. Rooms often had stone benches, used for sleeping, and holes indicate where curtains once hung. Large palaces, such as at Palenque, could be fitted with a water supply, and sweat baths were often found within the complex, or nearby. During the Early Classic, rulers were sometimes buried underneath the acropolis complex. Some rooms in palaces were true throne rooms; in the royal palace of Palenque there were a number of throne rooms that were used for important events, including the inauguration of new kings.

Palaces are usually arranged around one or more courtyards, with their façades facing inwards; some examples are adorned with sculpture. Some palaces possess associated hieroglyphic descriptions that identify them as the royal residences of named rulers. There is abundant evidence that palaces were far more than simple elite residences, and that a range of courtly activities took place in them, including audiences, formal receptions, and important rituals.

Temples were sometimes referred to in hieroglyphic texts as "kʼuh nah", meaning "god's house". Temples were raised on platforms, most often upon a pyramid. The earliest temples were probably thatched huts built upon low platforms. By the Late Preclassic period, their walls were of stone, and the development of the <a href="corbel%20arch">corbel arch</a> allowed stone roofs to replace thatch. By the Classic period, temple roofs were being topped with roof combs that extended the height of the temple and served as a foundation for monumental art. The temple shrines contained between one and three rooms, and were dedicated to important deities. Such a deity might be one of the <a href="Tutelary%20deity">patron gods</a> of the city, or a <a href="Veneration%20of%20the%20dead">deified ancestor</a>. In general, freestanding pyramids were shrines honouring powerful ancestors.

The Maya were keen observers of the sun, stars, and planets. <a href="E-Group">E-Group</a>s were a particular arrangement of temples that were relatively common in the Maya region; they take their names from Group E at <a href="Uaxactun">Uaxactun</a>. They consisted of three small structures facing a fourth structure, and were used to mark the <a href="solstice">solstice</a>s and <a href="equinox">equinox</a>es. The earliest examples date to the Preclassic period. The <a href="Mundo%20Perdido%2C%20Tikal">Lost World</a> complex at Tikal started out as an E-Group built towards the end of the Middle Preclassic. Due to its nature, the basic layout of an E-Group was constant. A structure was built on the west side of a plaza; it was usually a radial pyramid with stairways facing the cardinal directions. It faced east across the plaza to three small temples on the far side. From the west pyramid, the sun was seen to rise over these temples on the solstices and equinoxes. E-Groups were raised across the central and southern Maya area for over a millennium; not all were properly aligned as observatories, and their function may have been symbolic.

As well as E-Groups, the Maya built other structures dedicated to observing the movements of celestial bodies. Many Maya buildings were aligned with astronomical bodies, including the planet <a href="Venus">Venus</a>, and various constellations. The <a href="El%20Caracol%2C%20Chichen%20Itza">Caracol</a> structure at Chichen Itza was a circular multi-level edifice, with a conical superstructure. It has slit windows that marked the movements of Venus. At Copán, a pair of stelae were raised to mark the position of the setting sun at the equinoxes.

<a href="Triadic%20pyramid">Triadic pyramid</a>s first appeared in the Preclassic. They consisted of a dominant structure flanked by two smaller inward-facing buildings, all mounted upon a single basal platform. The largest known triadic pyramid was built at El Mirador in the Petén Basin; it covers an area six times as large as that covered by Temple IV, the largest pyramid at Tikal. The three superstructures all have stairways leading up from the central plaza on top of the basal platform. No securely established forerunners of Triadic Groups are known, but they may have developed from the eastern range building of E-Group complexes. The triadic form was the predominant architectural form in the Petén region during the Late Preclassic. Examples of triadic pyramids are known from as many as 88 archaeological sites. At Nakbe, there are at least a dozen examples of triadic complexes and the four largest structures in the city are triadic in nature. At El Mirador there are probably as many as 36 triadic structures. Examples of the triadic form are even known from <a href="Dzibilchaltun">Dzibilchaltun</a> in the far north of the Yucatán Peninsula, and Qʼumarkaj in the Highlands of Guatemala. The triadic pyramid remained a popular architectural form for centuries after the first examples were built; it continued in use into the Classic Period, with later examples being found at Uaxactun, Caracol, <a href="Seibal">Seibal</a>, <a href="Nakum">Nakum</a>, Tikal and Palenque. The Qʼumarkaj example is the only one that has been dated to the Postclassic Period. The triple-temple form of the triadic pyramid appears to be related to <a href="Maya%20mythology">Maya mythology</a>.

The <a href="Mesoamerican%20ballcourt">ballcourt</a> is a distinctive pan-Mesoamerican form of architecture. Although the majority of Maya ballcourts date to the Classic period, the earliest examples appeared around 1000 BC in northwestern Yucatán, during the Middle Preclassic. By the time of Spanish contact, ballcourts were only in use in the Guatemalan Highlands, at cities such as Qʼumarkaj and Iximche. Throughout Maya history, ballcourts maintained a characteristic form consisting of an ɪ shape, with a central playing area terminating in two transverse end zones. The central playing area usually measures between long, and is flanked by two lateral structures that stood up to high. The lateral platforms often supported structures that may have held privileged spectators. The Great Ballcourt at Chichen Itza is the largest in Mesoamerica, measuring long by wide, with walls standing high.

Although Maya cities shared many common features, there was considerable variation in architectural style. Such styles were influenced by locally available construction materials, climate, topography, and local preferences. In the Late Classic, these local differences developed into distinctive regional architectural styles.

The central Petén style of architecture is modelled after the great city of Tikal. The style is characterized by tall pyramids supporting a summit shrine adorned with a roof comb, and accessed by a single doorway. Additional features are the use of stela-altar pairings, and the decoration of architectural façades, lintels, and roof combs with relief sculptures of rulers and gods. One of the finest examples of Central Petén style architecture is Tikal Temple I. Examples of sites in the Central Petén style include <a href="Altun%20Ha">Altun Ha</a>, Calakmul, <a href="Holmul">Holmul</a>, <a href="Ixkun">Ixkun</a>, Nakum, Naranjo, and <a href="Yaxh%C3%A1">Yaxhá</a>.

The exemplar of Puuc-style architecture is Uxmal. The style developed in the Puuc Hills of northwestern Yucatán; during the Terminal Classic it spread beyond this core region across the northern Yucatán Peninsula. Puuc sites replaced rubble cores with lime cement, resulting in stronger walls, and also strengthened their corbel arches; this allowed Puuc-style cities to build freestanding entrance archways. The upper façades of buildings were decorated with precut stones mosaic-fashion, erected as facing over the core, forming elaborate compositions of long-nosed deities such as the rain god <a href="Chaac">Chaac</a> and the <a href="Principal%20Bird%20Deity">Principal Bird Deity</a>. The motifs also included geometric patterns, lattices and spools, possibly influenced by styles from highland <a href="Oaxaca">Oaxaca</a>, outside the Maya area. In contrast, the lower façades were left undecorated. Roof combs were relatively uncommon at Puuc sites.

The Chenes style is very similar to the Puuc style, but predates the use of the mosaic façades of the Puuc region. It featured fully adorned façades on both the upper and lower sections of structures. Some doorways were surrounded by mosaic masks of monsters representing mountain or sky deities, identifying the doorways as entrances to the supernatural realm. Some buildings contained interior stairways that accessed different levels. The Chenes style is most commonly encountered in the southern portion of the Yucatán Peninsula, although individual buildings in the style can be found elsewhere in the peninsula. Examples of Chenes sites include <a href="Dzibilnocac">Dzibilnocac</a>, <a href="Hochob">Hochob</a>, <a href="Xtampak">Santa Rosa Xtampak</a>, and <a href="Tabasque%C3%B1o">Tabasqueño</a>.

The <a href="R%C3%ADo%20Bec">Río Bec</a> style forms a sub-region of the Chenes style, and also features elements of the Central Petén style, such as prominent roof combs. Its palaces are distinctive for their false-tower decorations, lacking interior rooms, with steep, almost vertical, stairways and false doors. These towers were adorned with deity masks, and were built to impress the viewer, rather than serve any practical function. Such false towers are only found in the Río Bec region. Río Bec sites include <a href="Chicann%C3%A1">Chicanná</a>, <a href="Hormiguero%2C%20Mexico">Hormiguero</a>, and <a href="Xpuhil">Xpuhil</a>.

The Usumacinta style developed in the hilly terrain of the Usumacinta drainage. Cities took advantage of the hillsides to support their major architecture, as at Palenque and Yaxchilan. Sites modified corbel vaulting to allow thinner walls and multiple access doors to temples. As in Petén, roof combs adorned principal structures. Palaces had multiple entrances that used post-and-lintel entrances rather than <a href="Corbel%20arch">corbel vaulting</a>. Many sites erected stelae, but Palenque instead developed finely sculpted panelling to decorate its buildings.

Before 2000 BC, the Maya spoke a single language, dubbed <a href="Proto-Mayan%20language">proto-Mayan</a> by linguists. Linguistic analysis of reconstructed Proto-Mayan vocabulary suggests that the original Proto-Mayan homeland was in the western or northern Guatemalan Highlands, although the evidence is not conclusive. Proto-Mayan diverged during the Preclassic period to form the major Mayan language groups that make up the family, including <a href="Huastecan%20languages">Huastecan</a>, <a href="Quichean%20languages">Greater Kʼicheʼan</a>, <a href="Q%CA%BCanjobalan%20languages">Greater Qʼanjobalan</a>, <a href="Mamean%20languages">Mamean</a>, Tzʼeltalan-Chʼolan, and <a href="Yucatecan%20languages">Yucatecan</a>. These groups diverged further during the pre-Columbian era to form over 30 languages that have survived into modern times. The language of almost all Classic Maya texts over the entire Maya area has been identified as <a href="Classic%20Maya%20language">Chʼolan</a>; Late Preclassic text from Kaminaljuyu, in the highlands, also appears to be in, or related to, Chʼolan. The use of Chʼolan as the language of Maya text does not necessarily indicate that it was the language commonly used by the local populace – it may have been equivalent to <a href="Medieval%20Latin">Medieval Latin</a> as a <a href="sacred%20language">ritual</a> or <a href="Prestige%20%28sociolinguistics%29">prestige language</a>. Classic Chʼolan may have been the prestige language of the Classic Maya elite, used in inter-polity communication such as diplomacy and trade. By the Postclassic period, <a href="Yucatec%20Maya%20language">Yucatec</a> was also being written in Maya codices alongside Chʼolan.

The Maya writing system is one of the outstanding achievements of the pre-Columbian inhabitants of the Americas. It was the most sophisticated and highly developed writing system of more than a dozen systems that developed in Mesoamerica. The earliest inscriptions in an identifiably Maya script date back to 300–200 BC, in the Petén Basin. However, this is preceded by several other <a href="Mesoamerican%20writing%20systems">Mesoamerican writing systems</a>, such as the <a href="Isthmian%20script">Epi-Olmec</a> and <a href="Zapotec%20writing">Zapotec scripts</a>. Early Maya script had appeared on the Pacific coast of Guatemala by the late 1st century AD, or early 2nd century. Similarities between the Isthmian script and Early Maya script of the Pacific coast suggest that the two systems developed in tandem. By about AD 250, the Maya script had become a more formalized and consistent writing system.

The <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a> and colonial officials, notably <a href="Diego%20de%20Landa">Bishop Diego de Landa</a>, destroyed Maya texts wherever they found them, and with them the knowledge of Maya writing, but by chance three uncontested <a href="Maya%20codices">pre-Columbian books</a> dated to the Postclassic period have been preserved. These are known as the "<a href="Madrid%20Codex%20%28Maya%29">Madrid Codex</a>", the "<a href="Dresden%20Codex">Dresden Codex</a>" and the "<a href="Paris%20Codex">Paris Codex</a>". A few pages survive from a fourth, the "<a href="Grolier%20Codex">Grolier Codex</a>", whose authenticity is disputed. Archaeology conducted at Maya sites often reveals other fragments, rectangular lumps of plaster and paint chips which were codices; these tantalizing remains are, however, too severely damaged for any inscriptions to have survived, most of the organic material having decayed. In reference to the few extant Maya writings, <a href="Michael%20D.%20Coe">Michael D. Coe</a> stated:

Most surviving pre-Columbian Maya writing dates to the Classic period and is contained in stone inscriptions from Maya sites, such as stelae, or on ceramics vessels. Other media include the aforementioned codices, stucco façades, frescoes, wooden lintels, cave walls, and portable artefacts crafted from a variety of materials, including bone, shell, obsidian, and jade.

The Maya writing system (often called "<a href="Maya%20hieroglyphs">hieroglyphs</a>" from a superficial resemblance to the <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>ian writing) is a <a href="logosyllabic">logosyllabic</a> writing system, combining a <a href="syllabary">syllabary</a> of <a href="phonetic">phonetic</a> signs representing syllables with <a href="logogram">logogram</a> representing entire words. Among the writing systems of the Pre-Columbian New World, Maya script most closely represents the spoken language. At any one time, no more than around 500 glyphs were in use, some 200 of which (including variations) were phonetic.

The Maya script was in use up to the arrival of the Europeans, its use peaking during the Classic Period. In excess of 10,000 individual texts have been recovered, mostly inscribed on stone monuments, lintels, stelae and ceramics. The Maya also produced texts painted on a form of paper manufactured from processed tree-bark generally now known by its Nahuatl-language name "<a href="amatl">amatl</a>" used to produce <a href="codex">codices</a>. The skill and knowledge of Maya writing persisted among segments of the population right up to the Spanish conquest. The knowledge was subsequently lost, as a result of the impact of the conquest on Maya society.

The decipherment and recovery of the knowledge of Maya writing has been a long and laborious process. Some elements were first deciphered in the late 19th and early 20th century, mostly the parts having to do with <a href="Maya%20numerals">numbers</a>, the Maya calendar, and astronomy. Major breakthroughs were made from the 1950s to 1970s, and accelerated rapidly thereafter. By the end of the 20th century, scholars were able to read the majority of Maya texts, and ongoing work continues to further illuminate the content.

The basic unit of Maya logosyllabic text is the glyph block, which transcribes a word or phrase. The block is composed of one or more individual glyphs attached to each other to form the glyph block, with individual glyph blocks generally being separated by a space. Glyph blocks are usually arranged in a grid pattern. For ease of reference, epigraphers refer to glyph blocks from left to right alphabetically, and top to bottom numerically. Thus, any glyph block in a piece of text can be identified. C4 would be third block counting from the left, and the fourth block counting downwards. If a monument or artefact has more than one inscription, column labels are not repeated, rather they continue in the alphabetic series; if there are more than 26 columns, the labelling continues as A', B', etc. Numeric row labels restart from 1 for each discrete unit of text.

Although mayan text may be laid out in varying manners, generally text is arranged into double columns of glyph blocks. The reading order of text starts at the top left (block A1), continues to the second block in the double-column (B1), then drops down a row and starts again from the left half of the double column (A2), and thus continues in zig-zag fashion. Once the bottom is reached, the inscription continues from the top left of the next double column. Where an inscription ends in a single (unpaired) column, this final column is usually read straight downwards.

Individual glyph blocks may be composed of a number of elements. These consist of the main sign, and any affixes. Main signs represent the major element of the block, and may be a <a href="noun">noun</a>, <a href="verb">verb</a>, <a href="adverb">adverb</a>, <a href="adjective">adjective</a>, or <a href="Phonemic%20orthography">phonetic sign</a>. Some main signs are abstract, some are pictures of the object they represent, and others are "head variants", personifications of the word they represent. Affixes are smaller rectangular elements, usually attached to a main sign, although a block may be composed entirely of affixes. Affixes may represent a wide variety of speech elements, including nouns, verbs, verbal suffixes, prepositions, pronouns, and more. Small sections of a main sign could be used to represent the whole main sign, and Maya scribes were highly inventive in their usage and adaptation of glyph elements.

Although the archaeological record does not provide examples of brushes or pens, analysis of ink strokes on the Postclassic codices suggests that it was applied with a brush with a tip fashioned from pliable hair. A Classic period sculpture from Copán, Honduras, depicts a scribe with an inkpot fashioned from a conch shell. Excavations at Aguateca uncovered a number of scribal artefacts from the residences of elite status scribes, including palettes and <a href="mortar%20and%20pestle">mortars and pestles</a>.

Commoners were illiterate; scribes were drawn from the elite. It is not known if all members of the aristocracy could read and write, although at least some <a href="Women%20in%20Maya%20society">women</a> could, since there are representations of female scribes in Maya art. Maya scribes were called "aj tzʼib", meaning "one who writes or paints". There were probably scribal schools where members of the aristocracy were taught to write. Scribal activity is identifiable in the archaeological record; Jasaw Chan Kʼawiil I, king of Tikal, was interred with his paint pot. Some junior members of the Copán royal dynasty have also been found buried with their writing implements. A palace at Copán has been identified as that of a noble lineage of scribes; it is decorated with sculpture that includes figures holding ink pots.

Although not much is known about Maya scribes, some did sign their work, both on ceramics and on stone sculpture. Usually, only a single scribe signed a ceramic vessel, but multiple sculptors are known to have recorded their names on stone sculpture; eight sculptors signed one stela at Piedras Negras. However, most works remained unsigned by their artists.

In common with the other Mesoamerican civilizations, the Maya used a base 20 (vigesimal) system. The bar-and-dot counting system that is the base of Maya numerals was in use in Mesoamerica by 1000 BC; the Maya adopted it by the Late Preclassic, and added the symbol for zero. This may have been the earliest known occurrence of the idea of an explicit zero worldwide, although it may have been predated by the <a href="Babylonian%20mathematics">Babylonian system</a>. The earliest explicit use of zero occurred on monuments dated to 357 AD. In its earliest uses, the zero served as a <a href="Positional%20notation">place holder</a>, indicating an absence of a particular calendrical count. This later developed into a numeral that was used to perform calculation, and was used in hieroglyphic texts for more than a thousand years, until its use was extinguished by the Spanish.

The basic number system consists of a dot to represent one, and a bar to represent five. By the Postclassic period a shell symbol represented zero; during the Classic period other glyphs were used. The Maya could write any number from 0 to 19 using a combination of these symbols. The precise value of a numeral was determined by its position; as a numeral shifted upwards, its basic value multiplied by twenty. In this way, the lowest symbol would represent units, the next symbol up would represent multiples of twenty, and the symbol above that would represent multiples of 400, and so on. For example, the number 884 would be written with four dots on the lowest level, four dots on the next level up, and two dots on the next level after that, to give 4x1, plus 4x20, plus 2x400. Using this system, the Maya were able to record huge numbers. Simple addition could be performed by summing the dots and bars in two columns to give the result in a third column.

The Maya calendrical system, in common with other Mesoamerican calendars, had its origins in the Preclassic period. However, it was the Maya that developed the calendar to its maximum sophistication, recording lunar and solar cycles, eclipses and movements of planets with great accuracy. In some cases, the Maya calculations were more accurate than equivalent calculations in the <a href="Old%20World">Old World</a>; for example, the Maya solar year was calculated to greater accuracy than the <a href="Julian%20calendar">Julian year</a>. The Maya calendar was intrinsically tied to Maya ritual, and it was central to Maya religious practices. The calendar combined a non-repeating <a href="Maya%20Long%20Count%20Calendar">Long Count</a> with three interlocking cycles, each measuring a progressively larger period. These were the 260-day "tzolkʼin", the 365-day "<a href="haab%CA%BC">haabʼ</a>", and the 52-year <a href="Calendar%20Round">Calendar Round</a>, resulting from the combination of the "tzolkʼin" with the "haab"'. There were also additional calendric cycles, such as an 819-day cycle associated with the four quadrants of Maya cosmology, governed by four different aspects of the god Kʼawiil.

The basic unit in the Maya calendar was one day, or "<a href="k%CA%BCin">kʼin</a>", and 20 "kʼin" grouped to form a "<a href="winal">winal</a>". The next unit, instead of being multiplied by 20, as called for by the vigesimal system, was multiplied by 18 in order to provide a rough approximation of the solar year (hence producing 360 days). This 360-day year was called a "<a href="Tun%20%28Maya%20calendar%29">tun</a>". Each succeeding level of multiplication followed the vigesimal system.

The 260-day "tzolkʼin" provided the basic cycle of Maya ceremony, and the foundations of Maya prophecy. No astronomical basis for this count has been proved, and it may be that the 260-day count is based on the <a href="pregnancy">human gestation period</a>. This is reinforced by the use of the "tzolkʼin" to record dates of birth, and provide corresponding prophecy. The 260-day cycle repeated a series of 20-day-names, with a number from 1 to 13 prefixed to indicated where in the cycle a particular day occurred.

The 365-day "haab" was produced by a cycle of eighteen named 20-day "winal"s, completed by the addition of a 5-day period called the "wayeb". The "wayeb" was considered to be a dangerous time, when the barriers between the mortal and supernatural realms were broken, allowing malignant deities to cross over and interfere in human concerns. In a similar way to the "tzʼolkin", the named "winal" would be prefixed by a number (from 0 to 19), in the case of the shorter "wayeb" period, the prefix numbers ran 0 to 4. Since each day in the "tzʼolkin" had a name and number (e.g. 8 Ajaw), this would interlock with the "haab", producing an additional number and name, to give any day a more complete designation, for example 8 Ajaw 13 Keh. Such a day name could only recur once every 52 years, and this period is referred to by <a href="Mayanist">Mayanist</a>s as the Calendar Round. In most Mesoamerican cultures, the Calendar Round was the largest unit for measuring time.

As with any non-repeating calendar, the Maya measured time from a fixed start point. The Maya set the beginning of their calendar as the end of a previous cycle of "bakʼtun"s, equivalent to a day in 3114 BC. This was believed by the Maya to be the day of the creation of the world in its current form. The Maya used the Long Count Calendar to fix any given day of the Calendar Round within their current great "Piktun" cycle consisting of either 20 "bakʼtun"s. There was some variation in the calendar, specifically texts in Palenque demonstrate that the "piktun" cycle that ended in 3114 BC had only 13 "bakʼtun"s, but others used a cycle of 13 + 20 "bakʼtun" in the current "piktun". Additionally, there may have been some regional variation in how these exceptional cycles were managed.

A full long count date consisted of an introductory glyph followed by five glyphs counting off the number of "bakʼtun"s, "katʼun"s, "tun"s, "winal"s, and "kʼin"s since the start of the current creation. This would be followed by the "tzʼolkin" portion of the Calendar Round date, and after a number of intervening glyphs, the Long Count date would end with the "Haab" portion of the Calendar Round date.

Although the <a href="Maya%20calendar%23Calendar%20Round">Calendar Round</a> is still in use today, the Maya started using an abbreviated <a href="Maya%20calendar%23Short%20Count">Short Count</a> during the Late Classic period. The Short Count is a count of 13 kʼatuns. The Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel contains the only colonial reference to classic long-count dates. The most generally accepted correlation is the Goodman-Martínez-Thompson, or GMT, correlation. This equates the Long Count date 11.16.0.0.0 13 Ajaw 8 Xul with the <a href="Proleptic%20Gregorian%20calendar">Gregorian</a> date of 12 November 1539. Epigraphers <a href="Simon%20Martin%20%28Mayanist%29">Simon Martin</a> and <a href="Nikolai%20Grube">Nikolai Grube</a> argue for a two-day shift from the standard GMT correlation. The Spinden Correlation would shift the Long Count dates back by 260 years; it also accords with the documentary evidence, and is better suited to the archaeology of the Yucatán Peninsula, but presents problems with the rest of the Maya region. The George Vaillant Correlation would shift all Maya dates 260 years later, and would greatly shorten the Postclassic period. <a href="Radiocarbon%20dating">Radiocarbon dating</a> of dated wooden lintels at Tikal supports the GMT correlation.

The Maya made meticulous observations of celestial bodies, patiently recording astronomical data on the movements of the sun, moon, Venus, and the stars. This information was used for <a href="divination">divination</a>, so Maya astronomy was essentially for <a href="astrology">astrological</a> purposes. Maya astronomy did not serve to study the universe for scientific reasons, nor was it used to measure the seasons in order to calculate crop planting. It was rather used by the priesthood to comprehend past cycles of time, and project them into the future to produce prophecy. The priesthood refined observations and recorded eclipses of the sun and moon, and movements of Venus and the stars; these were measured against dated events in the past, on the assumption that similar events would occur in the future when the same astronomical conditions prevailed. Illustrations in the codices show that priests made astronomical observations using the naked eye, assisted by crossed sticks as a sighting device. Analysis of the few remaining Postclassic codices has revealed that, at the time of European contact, the Maya had recorded eclipse tables, calendars, and astronomical knowledge that was more accurate at that time than comparable knowledge in Europe.

The Maya measured the 584-day Venus cycle with an error of just two hours. Five cycles of Venus equated to eight 365-day "haab" calendrical cycles, and this period was recorded in the codices. The Maya also followed the movements of <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>, <a href="Mars">Mars</a> and <a href="Mercury%20%28planet%29">Mercury</a>. When Venus rose as the Morning Star, this was associated with the rebirth of the <a href="Maya%20Hero%20Twins">Maya Hero Twins</a>. For the Maya, the <a href="heliacal%20rising">heliacal rising</a> of Venus was associated with destruction and upheaval. Venus was closely associated with warfare, and the hieroglyph meaning "war" incorporated the glyph-element symbolizing the planet. Sight-lines through the windows of the Caracol building at Chichen Itza align with the northernmost and southernmost extremes of Venus' path. Maya rulers launched military campaigns to coincide with the <a href="heliacal%20rising">heliacal</a> or cosmical rising of Venus, and would also sacrifice important captives to coincide with such conjunctions.

Solar and lunar eclipses were considered to be especially dangerous events that could bring catastrophe upon the world. In the "Dresden Codex", a solar eclipse is represented by a serpent devouring the "kʼin" ("day") hieroglyph. Eclipses were interpreted as the sun or moon being bitten, and lunar tables were recorded in order that the Maya might be able to predict them, and perform the appropriate ceremonies to ward off disaster.

In common with the rest of Mesoamerica, the Maya believed in a supernatural realm inhabited by an array of powerful deities who needed to be placated with ceremonial offerings and ritual practices. At the core of Maya religious practice was the worship of deceased ancestors, who would intercede for their living descendants in dealings with the supernatural realm. The earliest intermediaries between humans and the supernatural were <a href="shamanism">shamans</a>. Maya ritual included the use of <a href="hallucinogens">hallucinogens</a> for "<a href="Maya%20priesthood%23Offices">chilan</a>", oracular priests. Visions for the "chilan" were likely facilitated by consumption of <a href="Nymphaea">water lilies</a>, which are hallucinogenic in high doses. As the Maya civilization developed, the ruling elite codified the Maya world view into <a href="Imperial%20cult">religious cults</a> that justified their right to rule. In the Late Preclassic, this process culminated in the institution of the divine king, the "kʼuhul ajaw," endowed with ultimate political and religious power.

The Maya viewed the cosmos as highly structured. There were thirteen levels in the heavens and nine in the underworld, with the mortal world in between. Each level had four cardinal directions associated with a different colour; north was white, east was red, south was yellow, and west was black. Major deities had aspects associated with these directions and colours.

Maya households interred their dead underneath the floors, with offerings appropriate to the social status of the family. There the dead could act as protective ancestors. Maya lineages were patrilineal, so the worship of a prominent male ancestor would be emphasized, often with a household shrine. As Maya society developed, and the elite became more powerful, Maya royalty developed their household shrines into the great pyramids that held the tombs of their ancestors.

Belief in supernatural forces pervaded Maya life and influenced every aspect of it, from the simplest day-to-day activities such as food preparation, to trade, politics, and elite activities. Maya deities governed all aspects of the world, both visible and invisible. The Maya priesthood was a closed group, drawing its members from the established elite; by the Early Classic they were recording increasingly complex ritual information in their hieroglyphic books, including astronomical observations, calendrical cycles, history and mythology. The priests performed public ceremonies that incorporated feasting, bloodletting, incense burning, <a href="Maya%20music">music</a>, ritual dance, and, on certain occasions, human sacrifice. During the Classic period, the Maya ruler was the high priest, and the direct conduit between mortals and the gods. It is highly likely that, among commoners, shamanism continued in parallel to state religion. By the Postclassic, religious emphasis had changed; there was an increase in worship of the images of deities, and more frequent recourse to human sacrifice.

Archaeologists painstakingly reconstruct these ritual practices and beliefs using several techniques. One important, though incomplete, resource is physical evidence, such as dedicatory caches and other ritual deposits, shrines, and burials with their associated <a href="Maya%20death%20rituals">funerary offerings</a>. Maya art, architecture, and writing are another resource, and these can be combined with <a href="ethnography">ethnographic</a> sources, including records of Maya religious practices made by the Spanish during the conquest.

Blood was viewed as a potent source of nourishment for the Maya deities, and the <a href="Sacrifice%20in%20Maya%20culture">sacrifice</a> of a living creature was a powerful blood offering. By extension, the sacrifice of a human life was the ultimate offering of blood to the gods, and the most important Maya rituals culminated in human sacrifice. Generally only high status prisoners of war were sacrificed, with lower status captives being used for labour.

Important rituals such as the dedication of major building projects or the enthronement of a new ruler required a human offering. The sacrifice of an enemy king was the most prized, and such a sacrifice involved decapitation of the captive ruler in a ritual reenactment of the decapitation of the Maya maize god by the death gods. In AD 738, the vassal king Kʼakʼ Tiliw Chan Yopaat of Quiriguá captured his overlord, Uaxaclajuun Ubʼaah Kʼawiil of Copán and a few days later ritually decapitated him. Sacrifice by decapitation is depicted in Classic period Maya art, and sometimes took place after the victim was tortured, being variously beaten, scalped, burnt or disembowelled. Another myth associated with decapitation was that of the Hero Twins recounted in the "<a href="Popol%20Vuh">Popol Vuh</a>": playing a ballgame against the gods of the underworld, the heroes achieved victory, but one of each pair of twins was decapitated by their opponents.

During the Postclassic period, the most common form of human sacrifice was heart extraction, influenced by the rites of the Aztecs in the Valley of Mexico; this usually took place in the courtyard of a temple, or upon the summit of the pyramid. In one ritual, the corpse would be skinned by assistant priests, except for the hands and feet, and the officiating priest would then dress himself in the skin of the sacrificial victim and perform a ritual dance symbolizing the rebirth of life. Archaeological investigations indicate that heart sacrifice was practised as early as the Classic period.

The Maya world was populated by a great variety of deities, supernatural entities and sacred forces. The Maya had such a broad interpretation of the sacred that identifying distinct deities with specific functions is inaccurate. The Maya interpretation of deities was closely tied to the calendar, astronomy, and their cosmology. The importance of a deity, its characteristics, and its associations varied according to the movement of celestial bodies. The priestly interpretation of astronomical records and books was therefore crucial, since the priest would understand which deity required ritual propitiation, when the correct ceremonies should be performed, and what would be an appropriate offering. Each deity had four manifestations, associated with the cardinal directions, each identified with a different colour. They also had a dual day-night/life-death aspect.

<a href="Itzamna">Itzamna</a> was the creator god, but he also embodied the cosmos, and was simultaneously a <a href="solar%20deity">sun god</a>; Kʼinich Ahau, the day sun, was one of his aspects. Maya kings frequently identified themselves with Kʼinich Ahau. Itzamna also had a night sun aspect, the <a href="Maya%20jaguar%20gods">Night Jaguar</a>, representing the sun in its journey through the underworld. The four <a href="Pawatun">Pawatun</a>s supported the corners of the mortal realm; in the heavens, the <a href="Bacab">Bacab</a>s performed the same function. As well as their four main aspects, the Bakabs had dozens of other aspects that are not well understood. The four Chaacs were <a href="Weather%20god">storm gods</a>, controlling thunder, lightning, and the rains. The nine lords of the night each governed one of the underworld realms. Other important deities included the <a href="Maya%20moon%20goddess">moon goddess</a>, the maize god, and the Hero Twins.

The "<a href="Popol%20Vuh">Popol Vuh</a>" was written in the Latin script in early colonial times, and was probably transcribed from a hieroglyphic book by an unknown Kʼicheʼ Maya nobleman. It is one of the most outstanding works of indigenous literature in the Americas. The "Popul Vuh" recounts the <a href="Mesoamerican%20creation%20myths">mythical creation</a> of the world, the legend of the Hero Twins, and the history of the Postclassic Kʼicheʼ kingdom. Deities recorded in the "Popul Vuh" include <a href="Hun%20Hunahpu">Hun Hunahpu</a>, the Kʼicheʼ maize god, and a triad of deities led by the Kʼicheʼ patron <a href="Tohil">Tohil</a>, and also including the moon goddess <a href="Awilix">Awilix</a>, and the mountain god <a href="Jacawitz">Jacawitz</a>.

In common with other Mesoamerican cultures, the Maya worshipped <a href="Feathered%20Serpent">feathered serpent deities</a>. Such worship was rare during the Classic period, but by the Postclassic the feathered serpent had spread to both the Yucatán Peninsula and the Guatemalan Highlands. In Yucatán, the feathered serpent deity was <a href="Kukulkan">Kukulkan</a>, among the Kʼicheʼ it was <a href="Q%CA%BCuq%CA%BCumatz">Qʼuqʼumatz</a>. Kukulkan had his origins in the Classic period <a href="Maya%20War%20Serpent">War Serpent</a>, "Waxaklahun Ubah Kan", and has also been identified as the Postclassic version of the <a href="Vision%20Serpent">Vision Serpent</a> of Classic Maya art. Although the cult of Kukulkan had its origins in these earlier Maya traditions, the worship of Kukulkan was heavily influenced by the <a href="Quetzalcoatl">Quetzalcoatl</a> cult of central Mexico. Likewise, Qʼuqʼumatz had a composite origin, combining the attributes of Mexican Quetzalcoatl with aspects of the Classic period Itzamna.

The ancient Maya had diverse and sophisticated methods of food production. It was believed that <a href="shifting%20cultivation">shifting cultivation</a> (swidden) agriculture provided most of their food, but it is now thought that permanent <a href="raised%20field">raised field</a>s, <a href="terrace%20%28agriculture%29">terracing</a>, intensive gardening, forest gardens, and managed fallows were also crucial to supporting the large populations of the Classic period in some areas. Indeed, evidence of these different agricultural systems persist today: raised fields connected by canals can be seen on aerial photographs. Contemporary rainforest species composition has significantly higher abundance of species of economic value to ancient Maya in areas that were densely populated in pre-Columbian times, and pollen records in lake sediments suggest that maize, <a href="manioc">manioc</a>, <a href="sunflower%20seed">sunflower seed</a>s, cotton, and other crops have been cultivated in association with deforestation in Mesoamerica since at least 2500 BC.

The basic staples of the Maya diet were maize, beans, and squashes. These were supplemented with a wide variety of other plants either cultivated in gardens or gathered in the forest. At <a href="Joya%20de%20Cer%C3%A9n">Joya de Cerén</a>, a volcanic eruption preserved a record of foodstuffs stored in Maya homes, among them were chilies and <a href="tomato">tomato</a>es. Cotton seeds were in the process of being ground, perhaps to produce cooking oil. In addition to basic foodstuffs, the Maya also cultivated prestige crops such as cotton, cacao and vanilla. Cacao was especially prized by the elite, who consumed <a href="History%20of%20chocolate">chocolate beverages</a>. Cotton was spun, dyed, and woven into valuable textiles in order to be traded.

The Maya had few domestic animals; <a href="Dogs%20in%20Mesoamerica">dogs</a> were domesticated by 3000 BC, and the <a href="Muscovy%20duck">Muscovy duck</a> by the Late Postclassic. <a href="Ocellated%20turkey">Ocellated turkey</a>s were unsuitable for domestication, but were rounded up in the wild and penned for fattening. All of these were used as food animals; dogs were additionally used for hunting. It is possible that deer were also penned and fattened.

There are hundreds of Maya sites spread across five countries: Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico.
The six sites with particularly outstanding architecture or sculpture are Chichen Itza, Palenque, Uxmal, and Yaxchilan in Mexico, Tikal in Guatemala and Copán in Honduras. Other important, but difficult to reach, sites include Calakmul and El Mirador. The principal sites in the Puuc region, after Uxmal, are <a href="Kabah%20%28Maya%20site%29">Kabah</a>, <a href="Labna">Labna</a>, and Sayil. In the east of the Yucatán Peninsula are Coba and the small site of Tulum. The Río Bec sites of the base of the peninsula include <a href="Becan">Becan</a>, Chicanná, <a href="Kohunlich">Kohunlich</a>, and Xpuhil. The most noteworthy sites in Chiapas, other than Palenque and Yaxchilan, are Bonampak and Toniná. In the Guatemalan Highlands are Iximche, Kaminaljuyu, <a href="Mixco%20Viejo">Mixco Viejo</a>, and Qʼumarkaj (also known as Utatlán). In the northern Petén lowlands of Guatemala there are many sites, though apart from Tikal access is generally difficult. Some of the Petén sites are Dos Pilas, Seibal, and Uaxactún. Important sites in Belize include Altun Ha, Caracol, and <a href="Xunantunich">Xunantunich</a>.

There are a great many museums across the world with Maya artefacts in their collections. The <a href="Foundation%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Mesoamerican%20Studies">Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies</a> lists over 250 museums in its Maya Museum database, and the <a href="European%20Association%20of%20Mayanists">European Association of Mayanists</a> lists just under 50 museums in Europe alone.

Alexandre Banza

<a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> Alexandre Banza (10 October 1932 – 12 April 1969) was a military officer and politician in the <a href="Central%20African%20Republic">Central African Republic</a>. Born in <a href="Carnot%2C%20Central%20African%20Republic">Carnot</a>, <a href="Ubangi-Shari">Ubangi-Shari</a>, Banza served with the <a href="French%20Army">French Army</a> during the <a href="First%20Indochina%20War">First Indochina War</a> before joining the <a href="Military%20of%20the%20Central%20African%20Republic">Central African Republic armed forces</a>. As commander of the Camp Kassaï military base in 1965, Banza helped <a href="Jean-B%C3%A9del%20Bokassa">Jean-Bédel Bokassa</a> <a href="Saint-Sylvestre%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">overthrow</a> the government of President <a href="David%20Dacko">David Dacko</a>. Bokassa rewarded Banza by appointing him as minister of state and minister of finance in the new government. Banza quickly established the new regime's reputation abroad and forged diplomatic relations with other countries. In 1967, Bokassa and his <a href="mentorship">protégé</a> had a major argument over the president's extravagances. In April 1968, Bokassa removed Banza as minister of finance. Recognizing Bokassa's attempts to undermine him, Banza made a number of remarks highly critical of the president's handling of the government. Bokassa responded by abolishing the minister of state position.

Banza soon decided to stage a <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a>. He confided in a few military officers, who he hoped would support his attempt to gain power. One of his confidants, Jean-Claude Mandaba, contacted the president and informed him of the date of the coup, 9 April 1969. Hours before he was going to execute his bid for power, Banza was ambushed by Mandaba and taken directly to Bokassa. Bokassa nearly beat Banza to death before Mandaba suggested that Banza be put on trial for appearance's sake. On 12 April, Banza presented his case to a <a href="military%20tribunal">military tribunal</a>, which quickly sentenced him to <a href="execution%20by%20firing%20squad">death by firing squad</a>. He was reportedly taken to an open field, where he was executed and buried in an unmarked grave. Alternate circumstances of Banza's death have been reported in "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" and "<a href="Le%20Monde">Le Monde</a>". In the aftermath of the failed coup, Banza's family, mistress and close associates were all arrested and either sent to jail or deported. With Banza eliminated, Bokassa spent extravagantly and surrounded himself with adulators.

Banza was born on 10 October 1932. He was the first of three sons and grew up in the heart of <a href="Gbaya%20people">Gbaya</a> territory. Banza studied In Cameroon and Cong-Brazzaville. In his twenties, he had served with the <a href="French%20army">French army</a> in the <a href="First%20Indochina%20War">First Indochina War</a> and had been stationed in <a href="Gabon">Gabon</a>, <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>, <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a> and other locations in colonial Africa. He had a similar military record to his future colleague <a href="Jean-B%C3%A9del%20Bokassa">Jean-Bédel Bokassa</a>, who had also served in the First Indochina War and had been stationed in Africa and Europe as a <a href="transmission%20%28telecommunications%29">radio transmissions</a> expert. Afterward, Banza returned to the Central African Republic, where he enlisted in the <a href="Military%20of%20the%20Central%20African%20Republic">armed forces</a>. Brian Titley, author of "Dark Age: The Political Odyssey of Emperor Bokassa" described Banza as an "intelligent, ambitious, and unscrupulous" military officer.

Central African Republic <a href="List%20of%20heads%20of%20state%20of%20the%20Central%20African%20Republic%20and%20Central%20African%20Empire">President</a> <a href="David%20Dacko">David Dacko</a>, Bokassa's cousin, took over the country in 1960, after winning a power struggle against <a href="Abel%20Goumba">Abel Goumba</a>. Bokassa left the French army to join the Central African Republic army in 1962. By 1965, the country was in turmoil—plagued by corruption and slow economic growth, while its borders were breached by rebels from neighboring countries. Dacko obtained financial aid from the <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">People's Republic of China</a>, but in spite of this support, the country's problems persisted. Bokassa, now <a href="commander-in-chief">commander-in-chief</a> of the army, made plans to take over the government; Dacko became aware of this, and countered by forming a <a href="gendarmerie">gendarmerie</a> headed by police chief <a href="Jean%20Izamo">Jean Izamo</a>, who quickly became Dacko's closest adviser.

Tensions between Dacko and Bokassa increased. In December 1965, Dacko approved a budget increase for Izamo's gendarmerie, but rejected the budget proposal for Bokassa's army. At this point, Bokassa told friends he was annoyed by Dacko's treatment and was "going for a coup d'état". Dacko planned to replace Bokassa with Izamo as his personal military adviser, and wanted to promote army officers loyal to the government, while demoting Bokassa and his close associates. Bokassa realized he had to act against Dacko quickly, and worried that his 500-man army would be no match for the gendarmerie and the presidential guard. He was also concerned the French would intervene to aid Dacko, as had occurred after the 23 February 1964 <a href="1964%20Gabon%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a> in <a href="Gabon">Gabon</a> against President <a href="L%C3%A9on%20M%27ba">Léon M'ba</a>. After receiving word of the coup from the country's military chief of staff, <a href="Omar%20Bongo">Albert-Bernard Bongo</a>, officials in Paris sent <a href="paratrooper">paratrooper</a>s to Gabon and restored M'ba to power in a matter of hours. Banza, who was then commander of the <a href="Camp%20Kassa%C3%AF%20military%20base">Camp Kassaï military base</a> in northeast Bangui, offered Bokassa his support and persuaded the still-worried commander-in-chief to carry out the coup. He helped Bokassa lay out the plans for the coup, proposed to take place on 31 December 1965.

Early in the evening of 31 December 1965, Dacko left the Palais de la Renaissance to visit one of his minister's plantations southwest of the capital. At 22:30 <a href="West%20Africa%20Time">WAT</a> (<a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a> 21:30), Captain Banza gave orders to his officers to begin the coup; one of his subordinates was to subdue the security guard in the presidential palace, while the other was to take control of Radio-Bangui to prevent communication between Dacko and his followers. Bokassa called Izamo at his headquarters, asking him to come to Camp de Roux to sign some papers that needed his immediate attention. Izamo, who was at a <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Eve">New Year's Eve</a> celebration with friends, reluctantly agreed and traveled in his wife's car to the camp. Upon arrival, he was confronted by Banza and Bokassa, who informed him of the coup in progress. After announcing his refusal to support the coup, Izamo was overpowered and locked in a cellar.

Shortly after midnight, in the first minutes of 1 January 1966, Bokassa and Banza organized their troops and told them of their plan to take over the government. Bokassa claimed that Dacko had <a href="resignation">resigned from the presidency</a> and given the position to his close adviser Izamo. He then told the soldiers that they had to act now to prevent the gendarmerie from taking over the Central African Republic army. He then asked the soldiers if they would support his course of action; the men who refused were thrown in jail. At 00:30 WAT, Banza, Bokassa and their supporters left Camp de Roux to take over the capital. They encountered little resistance and were able to take Bangui in a matter of hours. Bokassa and Banza then rushed to the Palais de la Renaissance, where they tried to arrest Dacko, who was not there. Bokassa began to panic, as he believed the president had been warned of the coup in advance, and immediately ordered his soldiers to search for Dacko in the countryside until he was found.

Dacko was not aware of the events taking place in the capital. After leaving his minister's plantation near midnight, he headed to Simon Samba's house to ask the <a href="Aka%20%28Pygmy%20tribe%29">Aka Pgymy</a> leader to conduct a year-end ritual. After an hour at Samba's house, he was informed of the coup in Bangui. He was arrested by a few of Bokassa's men as he entered Pétévo Junction, on the western border of the capital. Dacko was escorted to the presidential palace, where Bokassa hugged the president and told him, "I tried to warn you—but now it's too late". President Dacko was then taken to Ngaragba Prison in east Bangui at around 02:00 WAT. In a move that he thought would boost his popularity in the country, Bokassa ordered prison director Otto Sacher to release all prisoners in the jail. Bokassa then took Dacko to Camp Kassaï at 03:20 WAT, where the president was forced by Banza to resign from office. Banza wanted to kill Dacko, but Bokassa would not allow it, believing that Dacko had not yet outlived his usefulness. Later, Bokassa's officers announced on Radio-Bangui that the Dacko government had been toppled and Bokassa had taken over control. Meanwhile, Banza took over administrative centers, where politicians, diplomats and other high-level officials were celebrating the coming of the <a href="New%20Year">New Year</a>.

Banza was appointed <a href="minister%20of%20finance">minister of finance</a> and <a href="minister%20of%20state">minister of state</a> in the new government. The regime first secured diplomatic recognition from President <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Tombalbaye">François Tombalbaye</a> of neighboring <a href="Chad">Chad</a>, whom Bokassa met in <a href="Bouca">Bouca</a>, <a href="Ouham">Ouham</a>. After Bokassa reciprocated by meeting Tombalbaye on 2 April 1966 along the southern border of Chad at <a href="Sarh">Fort Archambault</a>, the two decided to help one another if either was in danger of losing power. Soon after, other African countries began to diplomatically recognize the new government. At first, the French government was reluctant to support the Bokassa regime, so Banza went to Paris to meet with French officials to convince them that the coup was necessary to save the country from turmoil. Bokassa met with Prime Minister <a href="Georges%20Pompidou">Georges Pompidou</a> on 7 July 1966, but the French remained noncommittal in offering their support. After Bokassa threatened to withdraw from the franc monetary zone, French President <a href="Charles%20de%20Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a> decided to make an official visit to the Central African Republic on 17 November 1966. To the new government, this visit meant that the French had accepted the new changes in the country.

As a minister of finance, Banza directed much of his energy and time into lifting the country out of <a href="bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a>. Banza was also successful in his efforts to build the government's reputation abroad, all the while establishing himself as a respected and well-liked leader. Many believed that the natural-born leader would not remain as Bokassa's right-hand man for much longer. After Banza was promoted from <a href="Captain%20%28Land%29">Captain</a> to <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> in 1965, Bokassa realized that his greatest political threat wasn't from the remaining group of Dacko supporters, but from Banza himself.

Two years later, the two had a major argument over the country's budget, as Banza adamantly opposed Bokassa's extravagant spending. Bokassa moved to Camp de Roux, where he felt he could safely run the government without having to worry about Banza's thirst for power. In the meantime, Banza tried to obtain a support base within the army, spending much of his time in the company of soldiers. Bokassa recognized what his minister was doing, so he sent military units most sympathetic to Banza to the country's border and brought his own army supporters as close to the capital as possible. In September 1967, he took a special trip to Paris, where he asked for protection from French troops. Two months later, the government deployed 80 paratroopers to Bangui.

On 13 April 1968, in another one of his frequent cabinet reshuffles, Bokassa demoted Banza to minister of health, but let him remain in his position as minister of state. Cognizant of the president's intentions, Banza increased his vocalization of dissenting political views. A year later, after Banza made a number of remarks highly critical of Bokassa and his management of the economy, the president, perceiving an immediate threat to his power, removed him as his minister of state.

Banza revealed his intention to stage a coup to Lieutenant Jean-Claude Mandaba, the commanding officer of Camp Kassaï, who he looked to for support. Mandaba went along with the plan, but his allegiance remained with Bokassa. When Banza contacted his co-conspirators on 8 April 1969, informing them that they would execute the coup the following day, Mandaba immediately phoned Bokassa and informed him of the plan. When Banza entered Camp Kassaï on 9 April 1969, he was ambushed by Mandaba and his soldiers. The men had to break Banza's arms before they could overpower and throw him into the trunk of a <a href="Mercedes-Benz">Mercedes</a> and take him directly to Bokassa. At his house in <a href="Berengo">Berengo</a>, Bokassa beat Banza nearly to death before Mandaba suggested that Banza be put on trial for appearance's sake.

On 12 April, Banza presented his case before a <a href="military%20tribunal">military tribunal</a> at Camp de Roux, where he admitted to his plan, but stated that he had not planned to kill Bokassa. He was <a href="capital%20punishment">sentenced to death</a> by <a href="execution%20by%20firing%20squad">firing squad</a>, taken to an open field behind Camp Kassaï, executed and buried in an <a href="unmarked%20grave">unmarked grave</a>. The circumstances of Banza's death have been disputed. The American newsmagazine, "Time", reported that Banza "was dragged before a Cabinet meeting where Bokassa slashed him with a razor. Guards then beat Banza until his back was broken, dragged him through the streets of Bangui and finally shot him." The French daily evening newspaper "<a href="Le%20Monde">Le Monde</a>" reported that Banza was killed in circumstances "so revolting that it still makes one's flesh creep":
A few days later, Bokassa had Banza's wife and their nine children arrested and <a href="deportation">deported</a> to <a href="Berb%C3%A9rati">Berbérati</a> and then <a href="Birao">Birao</a>. They were released on 6 May 1971. Banza's mistress, Julienne Kombo, who entered the Palais de la Renaissance crying hysterically after her lover's death, was arrested and jailed until 24 June 1972. Banza's father was sent to jail, where he died of hunger and exhaustion on 24 April 1970 at <a href="Ngaragba%20Central%20Prison">Ngaragba Central Prison</a>. Banza's two younger brothers, Beuoane and Gouboulo, were dismissed from the gendarmerie in July and sent to Ngaragba Prison. In August 1971, they were taken from the prison, never to be seen again.

Bokassa also hunted down Banza's close associates, such as Joseph Kallot, Faustin Marigot and Polycarpe Gbaguili. Kallot and Marigot died in prison in June 1969 and April 1971, respectively. With the exception of Gbaguili, who remained in prison until the downfall of the Bokassa regime on 20 September 1979, the other associates were released months after their arrest. Gbaguili served as a witness in Bokassa's criminal trials for <a href="treason">treason</a>, murder, <a href="cannibalism">cannibalism</a> and <a href="embezzlement">embezzlement</a> during the 1980s, explaining in detail the numerous crimes and human rights violations the former dictator had completed.

By eliminating his dangerous rival, Bokassa demonstrated his ability to deal ruthlessly with dissidents and political opponents. He started to rule more arbitrarily after the Banza affair, giving himself control of various ministerial positions and the army. In one instance, he promoted <a href="Second%20Lieutenant">Second Lieutenant</a> <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Boziz%C3%A9">François Bozizé</a>, the future president of the Central African Republic, to <a href="General%20officer">General</a> after he beat a Frenchman who showed disrespect for the president. According to Brian Titley, author of "Dark Age: The Political Odyssey of Emperor Bokassa", he surrounded himself with "sycophants, who were all too willing to nurture his growing <a href="megalomania">delusions of grandeur</a>"; with no one to stop him, he also spent money with reckless abandon.

Asylum confinement of Christopher Smart

The English poet <a href="Christopher%20Smart">Christopher Smart</a> (1722–1771) was confined to <a href="Psychiatric%20hospital">mental asylums</a> from May 1757 until January 1763. Smart was admitted into <a href="St%20Luke%27s%20Hospital%20for%20Lunatics">St Luke's Hospital for Lunatics</a>, <a href="Upper%20Moorfields">Upper Moorfields</a>, London, on 6 May 1757. He was taken there by his father-in-law, <a href="John%20Newbery">John Newbery</a>, although he may have been confined in a private madhouse before then. While in St Luke's he wrote "<a href="Jubilate%20Agno">Jubilate Agno</a>" and "<a href="A%20Song%20to%20David">A Song to David</a>", the poems considered to be his greatest works. Although many of his contemporaries agreed that Smart was "mad", accounts of his condition and its ramifications varied, and some felt that he had been committed unfairly.

Smart was diagnosed as "incurable" while at St Luke's, and when they ran out of funds for his care he was moved to Mr. Potter's asylum, Bethnal Green. All that is known of his years of confinement is that he wrote poetry. Smart's isolation led him to abandon the poetic genres of the 18th century that had marked his earlier work and to write religious poetry such as "Jubilate Agno" ("Rejoice in the Lamb"). His asylum poetry reveals a desire for "unmediated revelation", and it is possible that the self-evaluation found in his poetry represents an expression of <a href="Evangelicalism">evangelical</a> Christianity.

Late 18th-century critics felt that Smart's madness justified them in ignoring his "A Song to David", but during the following century <a href="Robert%20Browning">Robert Browning</a> and his contemporaries considered his condition to be the source of his genius. It was not until the 20th century, with the rediscovery of "Jubilate Agno" (not published until 1939), that critics reconsidered Smart's case and began to see him as a revolutionary poet, the possible target of a plot by his father-in-law, a publisher, to silence him.

Smart was confined to asylums during a time of debate about the nature of madness and its treatment. During the 18th century, madness was "both held to reveal inner truth and condemned to silence and exclusion as something unintelligible by reason, and therefore threatening to society and to humanity". It was commonly held to be an incurable affliction whose sufferers should be isolated from society. Physician <a href="William%20Battie">William Battie</a>—who later treated Smart—wrote:

[we] find that Madness is, contrary to the opinion of some unthinking persons, as manageable as many other distempers, which are equally dreadful and obstinate, and yet are not looked upon as incurable, and that such unhappy objects ought by no means to be abandoned, much less shut up in loathsome prisons as criminals or nuisances to the society.

In particular, Battie defined madness as "deluded imagination". However, he was attacked by other physicians, such as <a href="John%20Monro%20%28physician%29">John Monro</a>, who worked at <a href="Bethlem%20Hospital">Bethlem Hospital</a>. In his "Remarks on Dr. Battie's Treatise on Madness", Monro explained that those who were mad had the correct perceptions, but that they lacked the ability to judge properly. Although Monro promoted ideas of reform, his suggested treatment—beating patients—was as harsh on patients as Battie's preferred option, of completely isolating patients from society.

In 1758, Battie and others argued that those deemed "mad" were abused under the British asylum system, and they pushed for parliamentary action. Battie's "Treatise on Madness" emphasised the problems of treating the hospitals as tourist attractions and the punitive measures taken against patients. The arguments of Battie and others resulted in the passage of the <a href="Madhouses%20Act%201774">Act for Regulating Private Madhouses</a> (1774), but were too late to help Smart.

Modern critics, however, have a more cynical view of the 18th-century use of the term "madness" when diagnosing patients; psychiatrist <a href="Thomas%20Szasz">Thomas Szasz</a> viewed the idea of madness as arbitrary and unnatural. Agreeing with Szasz's position, philosopher <a href="Michel%20Foucault">Michel Foucault</a> emphasised that asylums were used in the 18th century to attack dissenting views and that the idea of madness was a cultural fear held by the British public, rather than a legitimate medical condition. In particular, Foucault considered the 18th century a time of "great confinement". This description is consistent with Smart's 1760s writings on the subject in which, according to Thomas Keymer, "the category of madness is insistently relativized, and made to seem little more than the invention of a society strategically concerned to discredit all utterances or conduct that threatens its interests and norms."

18th century treatment of inpatients was simple: they were to be fed daily a light diet of bread, oatmeal, some meat or cheese, and a little amount of beer, which were inadequate in meeting daily nutritional needs; they were denied contact with outsiders, including family members; and they would be denied access to that which was deemed to be the cause of their madness (these causes ranged from alcohol and food to working outside). If their actions appeared "afresh and without assignable cause", then their condition would be labelled as "original" madness and deemed incurable. An institution like St Luke's, run by Battie, held both "curable" and "incurable" patients. There were few spots available for patients to receive free treatment, and many were released after a year to make room for new admittances.

During the 1740s, Smart published many poems while a student at <a href="Pembroke%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Pembroke College, Cambridge</a>. He eventually left the university in 1749 to devote his time to poetry. In 1750, Smart started to familiarise himself with <a href="Grub%20Street">Grub Street</a>, London's writing district, and met <a href="John%20Newbery">John Newbery</a>, a publisher. Soon after, Newbery began publishing Smart's works in various magazines and in collections, including "Poems on Several Occasions" (1752). Of these works, Smart was known for his <a href="Seatonian%20Prize">Seatonian Prize</a>-winning poems, his <a href="Pastoral%23Pastoral%20poetry">pastoral poem</a> "<a href="The%20Hop-Garden">The Hop-Garden</a>", and his mock epic "<a href="The%20Hilliad">The Hilliad</a>". In 1752, Smart married Newbery's daughter, Anna Maria Carnan, and had two daughters with her by 1754. Although many of Smart's works were published between 1753 and 1755, he had little money to provide for his family. At the end of 1755, he finished a translation of the works of <a href="Horace">Horace</a>, but even that provided little income. Having no other choices, Smart signed a 99-year-long contract in November 1755 to produce a weekly paper entitled "The Universal Visiter or Monthly Memorialist", and the strain of writing caused Smart's health to deteriorate.

On 5 June 1756, Smart's father-in-law Newbery published, without permission, Smart's "Hymn to the Supreme Being", a poem which thanked God for recovery from an illness of some kind, possibly a "disturbed mental state". During the illness, Smart was possibly confined to Newbery's home and unable to write or be socially active. Out of sympathy for Smart, many of his friends, including writer and critic <a href="Samuel%20Johnson">Samuel Johnson</a>, began to write in the "Universal Visiter" to fulfill Smart's contractual obligation to produce content for the magazine. The publication of "Hymn to the Supreme Being" marked the beginning of Smart's obsession with religion and eventual confinement for madness because he began praying "without ceasing".

Smart's behaviour was probably influenced by <a href="Saint%20Paul%20%28apostle%29">St Paul</a>'s command in the <a href="First%20Epistle%20to%20the%20Thessalonians">First Epistle to the Thessalonians</a> to "Pray without ceasing" and <a href="William%20Law">William Law</a>'s "The Spirit of Prayer", which argues that a constant state of prayer will establish a connection with God. Smart began by praying at regular intervals but this slowly deteriorated into irregular praying in which he would interrupt his friends' activities and call them into the street to pray with him. These calls for public prayer continued until an incident that Smart later described in "Jubilate Agno": "For I blessed God in St James's Park till I routed all the company... For the officers of the peace are at variance with me, and the watchman smites me with his staff" ("Jubilate Agno" B 90–91).

Christopher Hunter, Smart's biographer and nephew, described the situation:

Though the fortune as well as the constitution of Mr. Smart required the utmost care, he was equally negligent in the management of both, and his various and repeated embarrassments acting upon an imagination uncommonly fervid, produced temporary alienations of mind; which at last were attended with paroxysms so violent and continued as to render confinement necessary.

Hunter reports that Samuel Johnson visited Smart during the latter's confinement, and it was Johnson that, "on the first approaches of Mr Smart's malady, wrote several papers for a periodical publication in which that gentleman was concerned." However, at no time did Smart ever believe himself to be insane; these meetings began before Smart was ever put into asylum because he still contributed, although not as significantly, to the "Universal Visiter". In joking about writing for the "Universal Visiter", Johnson claimed: "for poor Smart, while he was mad, not then knowing the terms on which he was engaged to write ... I hoped his wits would return to him. Mine returned to me, and I wrote in 'the Universal Visitor' no longer."

There are other possibilities beyond madness or religious fervor that may have led to Smart's confinement: Newbery may have used the imprisonment of his son-in-law as leverage to control the publication of Smart's work and as a warning to others who worked for him not to cross him. Another theory suggests Smart's actions were a result of alcohol, and had nothing to do with a mental imbalance. However, Smart may have been imprisoned for embarrassing his father-in-law in some way, which could have resulted from an incident in which Smart drank. <a href="Hester%20Thrale">Hester Thrale</a> reinforced this latter possibility when she claimed that Smart's "religious fervor" tended to coincide with times that Smart was intoxicated. Smart's own testimony that he "blessed God in St. James's Park till I routed all the company" ("Jubilate Agno" B 90–91) as representing his religious madness is equally dismissed as resulting from drinking, as he was known for pulling pranks and the <a href="Board%20of%20Green%20Cloth">Board of Green Cloth</a>, the government body that controlled St James's Park, would treat most disturbances in the park as resulting from madness. If Smart was placed into the asylum as a result of actions at St James's, he would not have been the only one, since records show that the Board of Green Cloth was responsible for admitting sixteen people to Bethlem Hospital for "frenzy" at St James's Park during the century prior to Smart being placed in St Luke's.

The specific events of Smart's confinement are unknown. He may have been in a private madhouse before St Luke's and later moved from St Luke's to Mr Potter's asylum until his release. At St Luke's, he transitioned from being "curable" to "incurable", and was moved to Mr Potter's asylum for monetary reasons. During Smart's confinement time, his wife Anna left and took the children with her to Ireland. There is no record that he ever saw her again. His isolation led him into writing religious poetry, and he abandoned the traditional genres of the 18th century that marked his earlier poetry when he wrote "Jubilate Agno".

During his time in asylum, Smart busied himself with a daily ritual of writing poetry; these lyric fragments eventually formed his "<a href="Jubilate%20Agno">Jubilate Agno</a>" and "<a href="A%20Song%20to%20David">A Song to David</a>". Smart might have turned to writing poetry as a way to focus the mind or as self-therapy. Although 20th-century critics debate whether his new poetic self-examination represents an expression of evangelical Christianity, his poetry during his isolation does show a desire for "unmediated revelation" from God. There is an "inner light" that serves as a focal point for Smart and his poems written during his confinement, and that inner light connects him to the Christian God.

Few details are known about Smart's time at <a href="St%20Luke%27s%20Hospital%20for%20Lunatics">St Luke's Hospital for Lunatics</a>. He was admitted to St Luke's on 6 May 1757 as a "Curable Patient". It is possible that Smart was confined at Newbery's behest over old debts and a poor relationship that existed between the two; Newbery had previously mocked Smart's immorality in "A Collection of Pretty Poems for the Amusement of Children six Foot High." Regardless of Newbery's exact reasons, there is evidence suggesting that Newbery's admittance of Smart into the mental asylum was not based on madness. To have Smart admitted, Newbery probably provided a small bribe, although bribes were against St Luke's policy.

There is little information about Smart's condition during his stay at St Luke's, possibly because Battie's denied his patients from being visited, including by their own family members. One of the few records that survive of Smart's time at St Luke's was an entry in "St Luke's Minute Book", which read:

12 May 1758Dr. Battie having acquainted this Committee that Christopher Smart (who was admitted on the 6th day of May 1757) continues disordered in his Senses notwithstanding he has been admitted into this Hospital above 12 Calendar Months and from the present Circumstances of his Case there is not Suffit. reason to expect his speedy Recovery And he being brought up and examined. Ordered. That he be discharged and that Notice be sent to his Securities to take him away.

During Smart's confinement at St Luke's, not even other doctors were allowed to see Smart unless they had received personal permission from Battie. It was improbable that Smart could have left the asylum without being released by Battie. Even if Smart would have attempted to obtain release via legal means, the rules for subpoenaing release would have been almost impossible to follow based on the system that Battie had in place, which isolated the individual from all contact. Eventually, Smart was deemed "incurable" and would not have been released by the hospital but for its lack of funds.

After being released from St Luke's, Smart was taken to a private madhouse. Elizabeth LeNoir, Smart's daughter, was brought to see her father and stated that he was "committed by Mr Newbery to the care of a "Mr Potter" who kept a private house at Bethnal Green". She described her experience as being held in a "small neat parlour". However, Mr Potter's private madhouse was not "homely", and Smart's treatments were far worse, as he describes: "For they work on me with their harping-irons, which is a barbarous instrument, because I am more unguarded than others" ("Jubilate Agno" B 129). Smart was left alone for four years, except for his cat Jeoffry and the occasional gawker who would come to see those deemed mad. Piozzi described Smart's general situation: "He was both a wit and a scholar, and visited as such while under confinement for MADNESS." It is very possible that he felt "homeless" during his confinement and surely felt that he was in a "limbo... between public and private space" from being watched by outsiders.

In London, only a few of his works were still being published, but the proceeds were taken by Newbery. However, Smart did get to see published a collection of his work under the pseudonym "Mrs Midnight" titled "Mrs. Midnight's Orations; and other Select Pieces: as they were spoken at the Oratory in the Hay-Market, London". Smart did not profit from the work, but he was able to see at least some of his previous work being printed again. Smart, according to his 20th-century biographer Arthur Sherbo, had only "his God and his poetry". A few of his loyal friends eventually grew tired of the treatment Smart received and freed him from Mr Potter's.

There is little information about how and why Smart was released from asylum, but his daughter claimed: "He grew better, and some misjudging friends who misconstrued Mr Newbery's great kindness in placing him under necessary & salutary restriction which might possibly have eventually wrought a cure, invited him to dinner and he returned to his confinement no more." What is known about the actual events is that John Sherratt, Christopher Smart's friend, believed that Smart's confinement was unfair and wanted to negotiate Smart's release. In January 1763, he met with a parliamentary committee to discuss the issue of individuals falsely imprisoned and abuses that they would receive in asylums. In particular, Sherratt argued that many were admitted for habitual intoxication, which undermined Battie's and other asylum keeper's reputations. A finding by the parliamentary committee released 27 January 1763 bolstered Sherratt's chances to release Smart. To those around him, Smart appeared perfectly sane, and he was most likely released because of legislation concurrently being passed in parliament advocating for a reform to patient care. Smart left the asylum on 30 January 1763 with Sherratt.

Upon leaving asylum, Smart took the manuscripts of "A Song to David", many translations of Psalms, and "Jubilate Agno". "A Song to David" was published on 6 April 1763. Harsh reviews followed which mocked Smart's time in the asylum instead of dealing with the poems. "Jubilate Agno" stayed in manuscript form and passed into the hands of the friends of <a href="William%20Cowper">William Cowper</a>, a poet also placed into asylum and Smart's contemporary, when they investigated the concept of "madness". The work stayed in private holdings until it was rediscovered in the 20th century by William Stead. It was not published until 1939 when it was printed with the title "Rejoice in the Lamb: A Song from Bedlam".

Samuel Johnson's biographer <a href="James%20Boswell">James Boswell</a> described a moment when <a href="Charles%20Burney">Charles Burney</a> inquired of his friend Johnson of Smart's state. Johnson used the term "madness" to comment on the state of society before explaining to Burney that Smart's actions that were deemed symptoms of madness were actually reasonable:

Madness frequently discovers itself merely by unnecessary deviation from the usual mode of the world. My poor friend Smart shewed the disturbance of his mind, by falling upon his knees, and saying his prayers in the street, or in any other unusual place. Now although, rationally speaking, it is greater madness not to pray at all, than to pray as Smart did, I am afraid there are so many who do not pray, that their understanding is not called in question.Concerning this unfortunate poet, Christopher Smart, who was confined in a mad-house, he had, at another time, the following conversation with Dr [Charles] Burney: – Burney. 'How does poor Smart do, Sir; is he likely to recover?' Johnson. 'It seems as if his mind had ceased to struggle with the disease; for he grows fat upon it.' Burney. 'Perhaps, Sir, that may be from want of exercise.' Johnson. 'No, Sir; he has partly as much exercise as he used to have, for he digs in the garden. Indeed, before his confinement, he used for exercise to walk to the ale-house; but he was "carried" back again. I did not think he ought to be shut up. His infirmities are not noxious to society. He insisted on people praying with him; and I'd as lief pray with Kit <nowiki>[=Christopher]</nowiki> Smart as any one else. Another charge was that he did not love clean linen; and I have no passion for it.' – Johnson continued. 'Mankind have a great aversion to intellectual labour; but even supposing knowledge to be easily attainable, more people would be content to be ignorant than would take even a little trouble to acquire it.'

In an article printed in the "<a href="Gentleman%27s%20Magazine">Gentleman's Magazine</a>", <a href="Hester%20Thrale">Hester Piozzi</a>, Smart's acquaintance and Johnson's close friend, argued that in many aspects Smart appears sane:

In every "other" transaction of life no man's wits could be more regular than those of Smart, for this prevalence of one idea pertinaciously keeping the first place in his head had in no sense, except in what immediately related to itself, perverted his judgement at all; his opinions were unchanged as before, nor did he seem more likely to fall into a state of "distraction" than any other man; less so, perhaps, as he calmed every violent start of passion by prayer.

Beyond Smart's circle of friends, few were willing to dismiss claims that Smart was affected by madness. Most contemporary literary critics knew of Smart's time in asylum and, upon publication of his "A Song to David", called attention to aspects of the poem which they could use to claim that Smart was still "mad". The view was widely held, and the poet <a href="William%20Mason%20%28poet%29">William Mason</a> wrote to <a href="Thomas%20Gray">Thomas Gray</a>, "I have seen his Song to David & from thence conclude him as mad as ever."

It was a century before a positive twist was put on Christopher Smart's time in asylum; the Victorian poet <a href="Robert%20Browning">Robert Browning</a> argued that "A Song to David" was great because Smart was mad at the time. In his poem "Parleyings" (1887), Browning claimed:
To Browning, Smart's temporary madness was what allowed him to compose in "A Song to David" poetry similar to that of <a href="John%20Milton">John Milton</a> and <a href="John%20Keats">John Keats</a>. Christopher Smart, as Browning's poem continued,
Browning's remarks brought about a later appreciation of "A Song to David" and Smart's madness. A review of Browning's "Parleying" claimed that Christopher Smart was "possessed by his subject... and where there is true possession – where the fires of the poet's imagination are not choked by self-consciousness or by too much fuel from the intellect – idiosyncrasy, mannerism, and even conventional formulae are for the time 'burnt and purged away'."

The 19th-century poet <a href="Dante%20Gabriel%20Rossetti">Dante Gabriel Rossetti</a> emphasised the benefits of Smart's madness and claimed that "A Song to David" was "the only great "accomplished" poem of the last century." Two years later, <a href="Francis%20Palgrave">Francis Palgrave</a> continued the theme when he wrote that the "Song" exhibited "noble wildness and transitions from grandeur to tenderness, from Earth to Heaven" and that it was "unique in our Poetry." Seven years after Palgrave, critic <a href="John%20Churton%20Collins">John Churton Collins</a> agreed with Rossetti and Palgrave, but to a lesser extent, when he wrote, "This poem stands alone, the most extraordinary phenomenon, perhaps, in our literature, the one rapt strain in the poetry of the eighteenth century, the work of a poet who, though he produced much, has not produced elsewhere a single line which indicates the power here displayed."

Twentieth-century critics favoured the view that Smart suffered from some kind of mental distress when writing his poems. A review by "Mathews" titled "Thin Partitions", in 30 March 1901 "The Academy", claimed that:
Now Christopher Smart was a very beggarly poet of the eighteenth century [...] but had not the smallest claim to rank with those great men beyond their common trade of poem. Kit Smart, in fact, though he wrote a pestilent deal of verse, could not write poetry—nor anything else [...] Legally mad, that is; for he appears to have been very mad in his senses, and a decent citizen out of them. He went mad—legally and medically—once, and nothing came out of it, perhaps because he was not mad enough. Then he went mad again and being duly shut up in Bedlam wrote one of the finest outbursts of lyric genius in the eighteenth century—perhaps "the" finest-before the advent of Blake [...] Smart regained his senses, and therewith his hopeless inability to write poetry. And he never did anything after.
In 1933, <a href="A.%20E.%20Housman">A. E. Housman</a> sided with Browning's and Mathew's interpretation and connected Smart's madness with poetic genius in his lecture "The Name and Nature of Poetry": "As matters actually stand, who are the English poets of that age in whom pre-eminently one can hear and recognize the true poetic accent emerging clearly from the contemporary dialect? These four: Collins, Christopher Smart, Cowper, and Blake. And what other characteristic had these four in common? They were mad." In 1994, Branimir Rieger differed from Housman's view by distancing Smart from the others when he argued that "Collins and Cowper pine as isolated individuals, guiltily aware of a vitality that is not finally human but divine. Smart soars beyond individuality to embrace that vitality, but at a cost of all human relationship."

However, there are many that disagreed that Smart suffered from madness; Edward Ainsworth and Charles Noyes, when discussing Smart's "Hymn to the Supreme Being", said, "The mind that composed this hymn was not deranged. Yet in the poem one sees the morbidly religious mind which, in disorder, was to produce the "Jubilate Agno", and, with order restored, the "Song to David". Additionally, they claimed that Smart's
preternatural excitement to prayer seems to have been poor Smart's only real mental aberration, unless his drunkenness be considered pathological. When his mind was removed entirely from the field of prayer, he was but little changed from his sane state. His powers of reason, though thus warped, were not taken from him, and he neither raved nor sank into mental lethargy.
Nevertheless, Ainsworth and Noyes were not completely sceptical about Smart's diagnosis when they continued: "But when the desire to pray struck him, Smart abandoned what the world chose to call rationality."

In 1960, neurologist <a href="Russell%20Brain%2C%201st%20Baron%20Brain">Russell Brain</a> diagnosed Smart as suffering from <a href="cyclothymia">cyclothymia</a> or <a href="bipolar%20disorder">manic depression</a>. Brain based his diagnosis on Smart's own claims about how he felt, and he concluded that "in Smart's case the mental illness was not the result of his drunkenness, but he drank because he was mentally unstable." Arthur Sherbo, in 1967, argued that "The nature of Smart's madness is impossible to diagnose at this distance in time" and then argued that:
since Battie himself pronounced him uncured, he must have been subject to hallucinations. Strong drink, taken often enough and in sufficient quantity, will have that effect, of course, but Battie, distinguishing between 'original' and 'consequential' madness [...] would allow only that excessive drinking could 'become a very common, tho' remoter cause of Madness.' Others differed: John Ball in his "Modern Practice of Physic", 1760, lists 'anxiety of mind' and too much 'strong vinous or spirituous liquors' as 'antecedent causes' of madness. Smart's mania, however it manifested itself, and it usually manifested itself in loud public prayer, did not stem from drunkenness; it was aggravated, however, by frequent recourse to the bottle. Ironically enough, as Mrs. Piozzi recognised, if Smart had prayed in the privacy of his home, all might have been well for him.

The possible religious component of Smart's condition was taken up by 20th-century critics as an explanation for why the 18th century saw Smart as mad. Laurence Binyon, in 1934, believed that religion played a major role in how society viewed Smart: "Smart's madness seems to have taken the form of a literal interpretation of the injunction "Pray without ceasing". He embarrassed visitors by insisting on their joining him in his supplications [...] Obsession with a fixed idea is a common form of insanity. But such obsessions are a mental imprisonment; whereas the "Song" is unmistakably the expression of a great release." Binyon's idea was picked up by Sophia Blaydes, in 1966, who pointed out that society was prejudiced against those who experienced <a href="enthusiasm">enthusiasm</a>, a strong spiritual connection to God. It was against religious prejudice that she argued,
The cause of Smart's eclipse may be traced in part to a prejudice of the age, one which was founded in reason but developed in fear. There was one inescapable fact which hampered any clear perception of Smart's work—he had been confined for madness. It was easier to use a difficult allusion or unusual image as evidence of madness than to interpret it. What could cause a fundamentally rational group of people to react so irrationally? To some degree, it was the fear of 'enthusiasm'.
In the 18th century, as Blaydes continued, the word changed from possessed by god to inspired to falsely inspired. The result of this change was that British society viewed enthusiasm as the enemy to both reason and social order. Thus, "Smart, the hack-writer, would not have been greeted by a hostile audience, but Smart, the enthusiast, would have been condemned immediately. The result would be obvious: his past work, previously lauded, would be ignored, and his future work would receive immediate condemnation. such was the history of Smart's contemporary reputation." In determining if Smart was really mad or not, Blaydes concluded, "in Smart's day, any sign of enthusiasm would have been cause for the judgment of madness [...] Two accounts of Smart and the nature of his madness have been preserved for us. Each permits some doubt that the poet was mad and could be regarded so in any age."

Frances Anderson, in 1974 characterised Smart's "illness" as insanity and obsession, but believed that "Smart's madness consisted of his efforts to obey literally St Paul's injunction to the Thessalonians: 'Pray without ceasing. During his episodes of illness, as Anderson continued, Smart "probably suffered some periods of delirium" but also "appeared to know what he was doing". Smart's actions were similar to 18th-century Methodists that were "addicted to public prayer with what was thought to be overly charged high spirits. Such displayers of religious emotionalism were often confined not only to private madhouses, but also to Bedlam". Later, in 1998, Charles Rosen pointed out that "The Enlightenment condemned religious enthusiasm as appropriate for the uneducated and the great unwashed" and "it is understandable that the only original and vital religious poetry between 1760 and 1840 should have been written by poets considered genuinely mad by their contemporaries: Smart, Blake, and Hölderlin."

Accounts at the end of the 20th century focused on the effects of Smart's confinement. Clement Hawes, following Michel Foucault's interpretation of the 18th century that there was an animality' of madness", believed that Smart emotionally connected with animals because of the "medical stigmatization" he felt at the hands of his fellow man. Chris Mounsey, agreeing with Hawes's interpretation, believed that Smart's treatment was "a bestializing process and had taught him to hold his tongue and sit out his time as quietly as possible." Contrary to the bestialisation, Allan Ingram argued that "Jubilate Agno" was "a poetic phenomenon that would have demolished contemporary poetic orthodoxies had it been publishable. The mad individual presented a gross distortion of the human form that nevertheless insisted on remaining human, but mad language could be even more disturbing."
