Battle of Vukovar

The Battle of Vukovar was an 87-day <a href="siege">siege</a> of <a href="Vukovar">Vukovar</a> in eastern <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a> by the <a href="Yugoslav%20People%27s%20Army">Yugoslav People's Army</a> (JNA), supported by various <a href="paramilitary">paramilitary</a> forces from <a href="Republic%20of%20Serbia%20%281990-2006%29">Serbia</a>, between August and November 1991. Before the <a href="Croatian%20War%20of%20Independence">Croatian War of Independence</a> the <a href="Baroque%20architecture">Baroque</a> town was a prosperous, mixed community of <a href="Croats">Croats</a>, <a href="Serbs">Serbs</a> and other ethnic groups. As <a href="breakup%20of%20Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia began to break up</a>, Serbia's President <a href="Slobodan%20Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87">Slobodan Milošević</a> and Croatia's President <a href="Franjo%20Tu%C4%91man">Franjo Tuđman</a> began pursuing nationalist politics. In 1990, an armed insurrection was started by <a href="Croatian%20Serb">Croatian Serb</a> militias, supported by the Serbian government and paramilitary groups, who seized control of Serb-populated areas of Croatia. The JNA began to intervene in favour of the rebellion, and conflict broke out in the eastern Croatian region of <a href="Slavonia">Slavonia</a> in May 1991. In August, the JNA launched a full-scale attack against Croatian-held territory in eastern Slavonia, including Vukovar.

Vukovar was defended by around 1,800 lightly armed soldiers of the <a href="Croatian%20National%20Guard">Croatian National Guard</a> (ZNG) and civilian volunteers, against as many as 36,000 JNA soldiers and <a href="Serb%20paramilitaries">Serb paramilitaries</a> equipped with heavy armour and artillery. During the battle, shells and rockets were fired into the town at a rate of up to 12,000 a day. At the time, it was the fiercest and most protracted battle seen in Europe since 1945, and Vukovar was the first major European town to be entirely destroyed since the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. When Vukovar fell on 18 November 1991, <a href="Vukovar%20massacre">several hundred soldiers and civilians were massacred</a> by Serb forces and at least 20,000 inhabitants were expelled. Most of Vukovar was <a href="ethnic%20cleansing">ethnically cleansed</a> of its non-Serb population and became part of the self-declared <a href="Republic%20of%20Serbian%20Krajina">Republic of Serbian Krajina</a>. Several Serb military and political officials, including Milošević, were later indicted and in some cases jailed for <a href="war%20crime">war crime</a>s committed during and after the battle.

The battle exhausted the JNA and proved a turning point in the Croatian war. A ceasefire was declared a few weeks later. Vukovar remained in Serb hands until 1998, when it was peacefully reintegrated into Croatia. It has since been rebuilt but has less than half of its pre-war population and many buildings are still scarred by the battle. Its two principal ethnic communities remain deeply divided and it has not regained its former prosperity.

Vukovar is an important regional centre on Croatia's eastern border, situated in eastern <a href="Slavonia">Slavonia</a> on the west bank of the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> river. The area has a diverse population of <a href="Croats">Croats</a>, <a href="Serbs">Serbs</a>, <a href="Hungarians%20of%20Croatia">Hungarians</a>, <a href="Slovaks">Slovaks</a>, <a href="Pannonian%20Rusyns">Ruthenians</a> and many other nationalities, who had lived together for centuries in relative harmony before the <a href="Croatian%20War%20of%20Independence">Croatian War of Independence</a>. It was also one of the wealthiest areas of <a href="Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> before the conflict. Vukovar's long-standing prosperity was reflected in one of Croatia's finest ensembles of <a href="Baroque%20architecture">Baroque architecture</a>.

The region underwent major demographic changes following the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, when its ethnic <a href="German%20people">German</a> inhabitants were expelled and replaced with settlers from elsewhere in Yugoslavia. In 1991, the last Yugoslav census recorded the Vukovar municipality, which included the town and surrounding villages, as having 84,189 inhabitants, of whom 43.8 percent were Croats, 37.5 percent were Serbs and the remainder were members of other ethnic groups. The town's population was 47 percent Croat and 32.3 percent Serb.

From 1945, Yugoslavia was governed as a federal socialist state comprising six newly created republics – <a href="Socialist%20Republic%20of%20Slovenia">Slovenia</a>, <a href="Socialist%20Republic%20of%20Croatia">Croatia</a>, <a href="Socialist%20Republic%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>, <a href="Socialist%20Republic%20of%20Serbia">Serbia</a>, <a href="Socialist%20Republic%20of%20Montenegro">Montenegro</a> and <a href="Socialist%20Republic%20of%20Macedonia">Macedonia</a>. The current border between Serbia and Croatia was defined in 1945 by a Yugoslav federal government commission which assigned areas with a Serb majority to the Socialist Republic of Serbia and those with a Croat majority to the Socialist Republic of Croatia. Nevertheless, a sizable Serb minority remained within the latter.

Following the death of Yugoslav leader <a href="Josip%20Broz%20Tito">Josip Broz Tito</a> in 1980, long-suppressed ethnic nationalism revived and the individual republics began to assert their authority more strongly as the federal government weakened. Slovenia and Croatia moved towards multi-party democracy and economic reform, but Serbia's authoritarian communist President <a href="Slobodan%20Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87">Slobodan Milošević</a> opposed reform and sought to increase the power of the Yugoslav government. In 1990, Slovenia and Croatia held elections that ended communist rule and brought pro-independence nationalist parties to power in both republics. In Croatia, the <a href="Croatian%20Democratic%20Union">Croatian Democratic Union</a> (HDZ) of <a href="Franjo%20Tu%C4%91man">Franjo Tuđman</a> took power, with Tuđman as President.

Tuđman's programme was opposed by many members of Croatia's Serb minority, towards whom he was overtly antagonistic. Croatia's <a href="Serb%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Croatia%29">Serb Democratic Party</a> (SDS), supported by Milošević, denounced the HDZ as a reincarnation of the nationalist-fascist "<a href="Usta%C5%A1e">Ustaše</a>" movement, which had massacred hundreds of thousands of Serbs during the Second World War. From mid-1990, the SDS mounted an armed rebellion in Serb-inhabited areas of Croatia and set up the self-declared <a href="Serbian%20Autonomous%20Oblast%20of%20Krajina">Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina</a>, with covert support from the Serbian government and Serbian paramilitary groups. The Croatian government rapidly lost control of large swathes of the republic. In February 1991, the Krajina Serbs declared independence from Croatia and announced that they would unite with Serbia. Other Serb communities in Croatia also announced that they would secede and established their own militias.

The conflict between Serbs and Croats spread to eastern Slavonia in early 1991. On 1 April, Serb villagers around Vukovar and other towns in eastern Slavonia began to erect barricades across main roads. The <a href="White%20Eagles%20%28paramilitary%29">White Eagles</a>, a Serbian paramilitary group led by <a href="Vojislav%20%C5%A0e%C5%A1elj">Vojislav Šešelj</a>, moved into the Serb-populated village of <a href="Borovo%20Selo">Borovo Selo</a> just north of Vukovar. In mid-April 1991, an incident occurred in the outskirts of Borovo Selo when three <a href="Armbrust">Armbrust</a> shoulder-launched <a href="anti-tank%20missile">anti-tank missile</a>s were fired on Serb positions. There were allegations that <a href="Gojko%20%C5%A0u%C5%A1ak">Gojko Šušak</a>, at the time the Deputy Minister of Defence, led the attack. There were no casualties, but the attack aggravated and deepened ethnic tensions. On 2 May, Serb paramilitaries ambushed two Croatian police buses in the centre of Borovo Selo, killing 12 policemen and injuring 22 more. Three Serbs were also killed. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Borovo%20Selo">Battle of Borovo Selo</a> represented the worst act of violence between the country's Serbs and Croats since the Second World War. It enraged many Croatians and led to a surge of ethnic violence across Slavonia.

Shortly after, <a href="Yugoslav%20People%27s%20Army">Yugoslav People's Army</a> (JNA) units moved into Borovo Selo. The army's intervention was welcomed by local Croatian leaders, but Croatia's Deputy Interior Minister, Milan Brezak, accused the JNA of preventing the Croatian police from dealing with the paramilitaries. Gun battles broke out across the region between rival militias. In Vukovar, Croatians harassed Serb residents, sometimes violently. Croatian police forcibly took over the local radio station, Radio Vukovar, and Serb members of the station's ethnically mixed staff were fired and replaced with Croats. Serb militias systematically blocked transport routes in the predominantly Serb-inhabited countryside around Vukovar, and within days the town could only be reached by an unpaved track running through Croat-inhabited villages. The atmosphere in Vukovar was said to be "murderous".

On 19 May 1991, the Croatian government held <a href="Croatian%20independence%20referendum%2C%201991">a nationwide referendum on a declaration of sovereignty</a>. In Vukovar, as elsewhere in Croatia, hardline Serb nationalists urged Serbs to boycott the referendum, while moderates advocated using the poll to register opposition to independence. Many local Serbs did vote, but the referendum passed with 94 percent nationally voting in favour.

Violence in and around Vukovar worsened after the independence referendum. Repeated gun and bomb attacks were reported in the town and surrounding villages. Sporadic shelling of the city started in June, and increased in intensity throughout the summer. <a href="Borovo%20Naselje">Borovo Naselje</a>, the Croatian-held northern suburb of Vukovar, sustained a significant shelling on 4 July. Serb paramilitaries expelled thousands of non-Serbs from their homes in the municipality. Croatian paramilitaries, led by <a href="Tomislav%20Mer%C4%8Dep">Tomislav Merčep</a>, attacked Serbs in and around Vukovar. Between 30 and 86 Serbs disappeared or were killed, and thousands of others fled their homes. A Croatian government representative in Vukovar told the Zagreb authorities that "the city is again [the] victim of terror, armed strife and provocative shoot-outs with potentially unfathomable consequences. The policy pursued so far has created an atmosphere of terror among the Croatian and Serbian population." Gunmen from both sides burned and looted hundreds of houses and farms in the area.

The conflict blurred ethnic lines. Many Serbs who had lived in Vukovar for generations – known as the "starosedioci" or "old settlers" – resisted the propaganda coming from Belgrade and <a href="Knin">Knin</a> and continued to live peacefully with their Croatian neighbours. The "došljaci", or "newcomers", whose families had relocated from southern Serbia and Montenegro to replace the deported Germans after 1945, were the most responsive to nationalist appeals. The journalist Paolo Rumiz describes how they "tried to win their coethnics over to the patriotic mobilization, and when they had no success with that, they killed them, plundered their property and goods, or drove them away. The old settlers would not let themselves be stirred up against other nationalities." When Croats fled the fighting they often gave their house keys for safekeeping to their Serb neighbours, whom they trusted, rather than to the Croatian police. The political scientist <a href="Sabrina%20P.%20Ramet">Sabrina P. Ramet</a> notes that a distinctive feature of the war in eastern Slavonia was "the mobilization of those who were not integrated into the multi-cultural life of the cities against urban multi-culturalism." Former Belgrade mayor Bogdan Bogdanović characterised the attack on Vukovar as an act of <a href="urbicide">urbicide</a>, a deliberate assault on urbanism.

By the end of July 1991, an improvised Croatian defence force in Vukovar was almost surrounded by Serbian militias in the neighbouring villages. Paramilitaries, JNA soldiers and Serbian <a href="Territorial%20Defense%20Forces%20%28Yugoslavia%29">Territorial Defence</a> (TO) conscripts were present in Serb-inhabited areas. There was a small JNA barracks in Vukovar's Sajmište district, surrounded by Croatian-controlled territory. Although the two sides were commonly referred to as "Croatian" and "Serbian" or "Yugoslav", Serbs and Croats as well as many other of Yugoslavia's national groups fought on both sides. The first commander of the attacking force was Macedonian. Serbs and members of other ethnicities made up a substantial portion of the Croatian defenders.

The Croatian force in Vukovar comprised 1,800 men assembled from units of the newly created Croatian National Guard, including 400 members of the <a href="3rd%20Guards%20Brigade%20%28Croatia%29">3rd Guards Brigade</a> and the <a href="1st%20Guards%20Brigade%20%28Croatia%29">1st Guards Brigade</a>. The 4th Battalion of the 3rd Guards Brigade was stationed in the city from the beginning, while elements of the 1st Guards Brigade arrived retreating from elsewhere in western Syrmia. In addition to the guardsmen there were 300 police officers and 1,100 civilian volunteers from Vukovar and nearby communities. The bulk of the force had initially been organised in an improvised manner. In late September 1991, it was formally reorganised as the <a href="204th%20Vukovar%20Brigade">204th Vukovar Brigade</a>, also known as the 124th Brigade.

Volunteers arrived from other parts of Croatia, including 58 members of the far-right paramilitary <a href="Croatian%20Defence%20Forces">Croatian Defence Forces</a> (HOS), backed by <a href="Dobroslav%20Paraga">Dobroslav Paraga</a>'s extreme nationalist <a href="Croatian%20Party%20of%20Rights">Croatian Party of Rights</a> (HSP). The defenders were a cross-section of Vukovar society. As many as one-third were non-Croats, including Serbs, Ruthenians, Hungarians and members of other ethnicities. About 100 of the defenders were Serbs. "We had complete confidence in them," one Croatian veteran later remarked. "They defended Vukovar alongside us."

Croatian forces in Vukovar were commanded by <a href="Mile%20Dedakovi%C4%87">Mile Dedaković</a>, a former JNA officer who had joined the ZNG and volunteered to take charge of the town's defences. During the battle, he went by the "<a href="Pseudonym">nom de guerre</a>" "Jastreb" ("Hawk"). Gojko Šušak, by now Croatia's <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28Croatia%29">Minister of Defence</a>, used Dedaković as an example of how Serbs were also taking part in Vukovar's defence. The claim was later reprinted by independent sources, but was false.
Dedaković's second-in-command, Branko Borković, was another former JNA officer who had volunteered for service in Vukovar. The two men established a unified command structure, organised the defenders into a single brigade and implemented an integrated defence system. A defensive ring of six sectors was established, each assigned to one unit within the 204th Brigade. The defenders used a network of cellars, canals, ditches and trenches to redeploy around the sectors as needed.

At the start of the battle, they were poorly armed and many were equipped only with hunting rifles. They relied mostly on light infantry weapons, but obtained a few artillery pieces and anti-aircraft guns and improvised their own land mines. They also obtained several hundred anti-tank weapons such as <a href="M79%20Rocket%20Launcher">M79</a> and <a href="M80%20Rocket%20Launcher">M80</a> rocket launchers, but were critically short of ammunition throughout the battle. The capture of JNA barracks somewhat improved the situation as Vukovar had the priority in the supply of arms. It is estimated that the Vukovar battlefield consumed around 55–60 percent of all ammunition available to the Croatian forces.

The attacking force included JNA soldiers conscripted from across Yugoslavia, members of the TO, <a href="Chetniks">Chetniks</a> (Serbian nationalist paramilitaries), local Serb militiamen and units of the <a href="Yugoslav%20Navy">Yugoslav Navy</a> and the <a href="SFR%20Yugoslav%20Air%20Force">Yugoslav Air Force</a>. At their peak, the Yugoslav and Serb forces in the vicinity of Vukovar numbered about 36,000. They were equipped with heavy artillery, rockets and tanks and supported by aircraft and naval vessels on the Danube.

Although the battle was fought primarily by the federal Yugoslav military, the government of Serbia was directly involved. The Serbian secret police agency, the SDB, took part in military operations, and some of its officers commanded Serbian TO units fighting in Vukovar. Serbia's <a href="Ministry%20of%20Internal%20Affairs%20%28Serbia%29">Ministry of Internal Affairs</a> directed the activities of the paramilitaries. It was also responsible for arming and equipping them. Slobodan Milošević was later accused of direct involvement. According to <a href="Veselin%20%C5%A0ljivan%C4%8Danin">Veselin Šljivančanin</a>, who was later convicted of war crimes committed at Vukovar, the order to shell Vukovar came "from <a href="Dedinje">Dedinje</a>" – the elite Belgrade quarter where Milošević lived.
At the start of the war in Slovenia, the army still saw itself as the defender of a federal, communist Yugoslavia, rather than an instrument of Serbian nationalism. Its head, General <a href="Veljko%20Kadijevi%C4%87">Veljko Kadijević</a>, the Yugoslav Minister of Defence and a committed communist, initially sought to forcibly keep Yugoslavia together and proclaimed the army's neutrality in the Serb-Croat conflict. The JNA leadership aimed to cut Croatia in two by seizing the Serb-inhabited inland regions, almost all of the <a href="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a>n coast and much of central and eastern Croatia. It aimed to force Croatia's political leadership to capitulate and renegotiate its membership of Yugoslavia. The JNA's leadership was not yet dominated by ethnic Serbs, and these early goals reflected the Yugoslav outlook of its multiethnic leadership. Kadijević was half-Croat and half-Serb, his deputy was a Slovene, the commander of JNA forces in the first phase of the battle was a Macedonian, and the head of the Yugoslav Air Force, which repeatedly bombed Vukovar during the battle, was a Croat.

The loss of Slovenia in the <a href="Ten-Day%20War">Ten-Day War</a> made it impossible to fulfil the original objective of keeping Yugoslavia intact. Many of the Serb members of the army no longer wanted to fight for a multiethnic Yugoslavia. The army developed an increasingly Serbian character as non-Serbs deserted or refused to be drafted. Some JNA commanders overtly supported the Serb rebels in Croatia and provided them with weapons. Although Kadijević and other senior JNA commanders initially argued that "the JNA must defend all the nations of Yugoslavia", they eventually recognised that they had no chance of achieving their original goals, and threw their support behind the rebel Serbs of Croatia.

Yugoslav and Serb propaganda portrayed Croatian separatists as genocidal "Ustaše", who had illegally taken over Yugoslav territory and were threatening Serb civilians in a reprise of the anti-Serb pogroms of the Second World War. Kadijević later justified the JNA's offensive against Vukovar on the grounds that it was part of the "backbone of the Croatian army" and had to be "liberated". The JNA's periodical "Narodna Armija" claimed after the battle that Vukovar "had for decades been prepared to support German military penetration down the Danube." Šešelj declared: "We're all one army. This war is a great test for Serbs. Those who pass the test will become winners. Deserters cannot go unpunished. Not a single "Ustaša" must leave Vukovar alive."

The Battle of Vukovar took place in two phases over about 90 days: from August to September 1991, before the town was fully surrounded, and from early October to mid-November, when the town was encircled then taken by the JNA. Starting in June, Vukovar and neighbouring villages were subjected to daily or near-daily artillery and mortar fire. In July, the JNA and TO began deploying in large numbers across eastern Slavonia, surrounding Vukovar from three sides. Heavy fighting began at the end of August. On 23 August, Borovo Naselje came under heavy shellfire, and Croatian forces shot down two Yugoslav <a href="Soko%20G-2%20Galeb">G-2 Galeb</a> fighter aircraft using <a href="Man-portable%20air-defense%20systems">shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles</a>. The following day, the JNA, the Yugoslav Air Force and the Yugoslav Navy launched a major attack using aircraft, naval vessels on the Danube, tanks and artillery. The attack, which was mounted from both sides of the border, caused extensive damage and resulted in many civilian casualties.

On 14 September, the Croatian government ordered an attack against all JNA garrisons and arms depots in the country, an offensive dubbed the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Barracks">Battle of the Barracks</a>. Vukovar's JNA barracks was among those attacked that day, but the JNA managed to defend it. In retaliation, Serb paramilitaries attacked areas to the southwest of Vukovar from the direction of <a href="Negoslavci">Negoslavci</a>, forcing about 2,000 people to flee. There were reports of mass killings and scores of civilian deaths. Croatian forces outside the Vukovar perimeter received large quantities of arms and ammunition from depots captured elsewhere, enabling them to hold the line.

The JNA responded by <a href="Yugoslav%20campaign%20in%20Croatia">launching a major offensive in eastern Slavonia</a>, from where it intended to progress west via <a href="Vinkovci">Vinkovci</a> and <a href="Osijek">Osijek</a> to Zagreb. The JNA did not bypass Vukovar because its leadership wished to relieve the besieged barracks and to eliminate a possible threat to their supply lines. The JNA did not intend to make Vukovar the main focus of the offensive, but as happened with <a href="Battle%20of%20Stalingrad">Stalingrad in the Second World War</a>, an initially inconsequential engagement became an essential political symbol for both sides.

On 19 September, a JNA force consisting of at least 100 <a href="T-55">T-55</a> and <a href="M-84">M-84</a> tanks with armoured personnel carriers and heavy artillery pieces left Belgrade. It crossed into Croatia near the Serbian town of <a href="%C5%A0id">Šid</a> on 20 September. The Croatians were quickly routed and fell back to Vukovar. The JNA's 1st Guards Mechanised Brigade soon reached the Vukovar barracks and lifted the Croatian siege of the facility. They also moved to encircle Vukovar. By 30 September, the town was almost completely surrounded. All roads in and out were blocked, and the only route in was via a farm track through a perilously exposed cornfield.

The JNA launched repeated assaults on Vukovar but failed to make any progress. Its armour, designed for combat in open country, was barely able to enter Vukovar's narrow streets. Support from regular infantry was lacking, and the TO's poorly trained and motivated troops were inadequate substitutes. The JNA's soldiers appeared to have little understanding of how to conduct <a href="urban%20warfare">urban operations</a> and its officers displayed slow and reactive decision-making on the ground.

Croatian forces countered the JNA's attacks by mining approach roads, sending out mobile teams equipped with anti-tank weapons, deploying many <a href="sniper">sniper</a>s, and fighting back from heavily fortified positions. The JNA initially relied on massing armoured spearheads which would advance along a street in a column followed by a few companies of infantry. The Croatians responded by opening fire with anti-tank weapons at very close range – often as short as  – to disable the lead and rear vehicles, trapping the rest of the column, where it could be systematically disabled. They tried to avoid completely destroying the JNA's armour, as the materiel they retrieved from disabled vehicles was an important source of resupply. The Croatians employed a strategy of "active defence", carrying out hit-and-run attacks to keep the JNA off balance. Anti-tank and anti-personnel mines hindered JNA manoeuvres. Unconventional tactics were used to undermine the JNA's morale, such as firing <a href="sounding%20rocket">weather rockets</a> and sabotaging JNA tanks by planting mines underneath them while they were parked at night, causing them to explode when their crews started them in the morning. JNA casualties were heavy. On one road, dubbed the "tank graveyard", about a hundred JNA armoured vehicles were destroyed, fifteen of them by <a href="Colonel">Colonel</a> <a href="Marko%20Babi%C4%87%20%28soldier%29">Marko Babić</a>. The high casualties had a debilitating effect on morale all the way up the chain of command.

The JNA began launching artillery and rocket barrages against the town. By the end of the battle, over 700,000 shells and other missiles had been fired at Vukovar at a rate of up to 12,000 a day. It is estimated that Vukovar as well as its surroundings were bombarded with more than 2.5 million shells over . Metre for metre, the bombardment was more intense than at Stalingrad. The thousands of civilians remaining in Vukovar took shelter in cellars and bomb shelters that had been built during the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>.

The JNA's lack of infantry support was due to a disastrously low level of mobilisation in the preceding months. Many reservists – who were drawn from all the Yugoslav republics, including Croatia – refused to report for duty, and many serving soldiers deserted rather than fight. Serbia was never formally at war and no general mobilisation was carried out. An estimated 150,000 Serbs went abroad to avoid conscription, and many others deserted or went into hiding. Only 13 percent of conscripts reported for duty. Another 40,000 staged rebellions in towns across Serbia; the Serbian newspaper "<a href="Vreme">Vreme</a>" commented in July 1991 that the situation was one of "total military disintegration".

Morale on the battlefield was poor. JNA commanders resorted to firing on their own positions to motivate their men to fight. When the commander of a JNA unit at Vukovar demanded to know who was willing to fight and who wanted to go home, the unit split in two; one conscript, unable to decide which side to take, shot himself on the spot. A JNA officer who served at Vukovar later described how his men refused to obey orders on several occasions, "abandoning combat vehicles, discarding weapons, gathering on some flat ground, sitting and singing "<a href="Give%20Peace%20a%20Chance">Give Peace a Chance</a>" by John Lennon." In late October, an entire infantry battalion from <a href="Novi%20Sad">Novi Sad</a> in Serbia abandoned an attack on Borovo Naselje and fled. Another group of reservists threw away their weapons and went back to Serbia on foot across a nearby bridge. A tank driver, Vladimir Živković, drove his vehicle from the front line at Vukovar to the Yugoslav parliament in Belgrade, where he parked on the steps in front of the building. He was arrested and declared insane by the authorities. His treatment enraged his colleagues, who protested by taking over a local radio station at gunpoint and issuing a declaration that "we are not traitors, but we do not want to be aggressors."

In late September, Lieutenant Colonel General <a href="%C5%BDivota%20Pani%C4%87">Života Panić</a> was put in charge of the operation against Vukovar. He established new headquarters and command-and-control arrangements to resolve the disorganisation that had hindered the JNA's operations. Panić divided the JNA forces into Northern and Southern <a href="Area%20of%20Responsibility">Areas of Responsibility</a> (AORs). The northern AOR was assigned to Major General <a href="Mladen%20Brati%C4%87">Mladen Bratić</a>, while Colonel <a href="Mile%20Mrk%C5%A1i%C4%87">Mile Mrkšić</a> was given charge of the south. As well as fresh troops, paramilitary volunteers from Serbia were brought in. They were well armed and highly motivated but often undisciplined and brutal. They were formed into units of company and battalion size as substitutes for the missing reservists. The commander of the Novi Sad corps was videotaped after the battle praising the <a href="Serb%20Volunteer%20Guard">Serb Volunteer Guard</a> ("Tigers") of <a href="%C5%BDeljko%20Ra%C5%BEnatovi%C4%87">Željko Ražnatović</a>, known as "Arkan":

Panić combined well-motivated paramilitary infantry with trained engineering units to clear mines and defensive positions, supported by heavy armour and artillery. The paramilitaries spearheaded a fresh offensive that began on 30 September. The assault succeeded in cutting the Croatian supply route to Vukovar when the village of <a href="Marinci%2C%20Croatia">Marinci</a>, on the route out of the town, was captured on 1 October. Shortly afterwards, the Croatian 204th Brigade's commander, Mile Dedaković, broke out with a small escort, slipping through the Serbian lines to reach the Croatian-held town of Vinkovci. His deputy, Branko Borković, took over command of Vukovar's defences. General <a href="Anton%20Tus">Anton Tus</a>, commander of the Croatian forces outside the Vukovar perimeter, put Dedaković in charge of a breakthrough operation to relieve the town and launched a counter-offensive on 13 October. Around 800 soldiers and 10 tanks were engaged in the attack, which began in the early morning with artillery preparation. Special police forces entered Marinci before noon, but had to retreat as they did not have enough strength to hold their positions. Croatian tanks and infantry encountered heavy resistance from the JNA and were halted at Nuštar by artillery fire. The JNA's 252nd Armoured Brigade inflicted heavy losses on the Croatian forces and around 13:00 the attack was stopped by the HV General Staff. A humanitarian convoy of the Red Cross was let through to Vukovar.

During the battle's final phase, Vukovar's remaining inhabitants, including several thousand Serbs, took refuge in cellars and communal bomb shelters, which housed up to 700 people each. A crisis committee was established, operating from a nuclear bunker beneath the municipal hospital. The committee assumed control of the town's management and organised the delivery of food, water and medical supplies. It kept the number of civilians on the streets to a minimum and ensured that each shelter was guarded and had at least one doctor and nurse assigned to it.

Vukovar's hospital had to deal with hundreds of injuries. In the second half of September, the number of wounded reached between 16 and 80 per day, three-quarters of them civilians. Even though it was marked with the <a href="Emblems%20of%20the%20International%20Red%20Cross%20and%20Red%20Crescent%20Movement%23Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> symbol, the hospital was struck by over 800 shells during the battle. Much of the building was wrecked, and the staff and patients had to relocate to underground service corridors. The intensive care unit was moved into the building's nuclear bomb shelter. On 4 October, the Yugoslav Air Force attacked the hospital, destroying its operating theatre. One bomb fell through several floors, failed to explode and landed on the foot of a wounded man, without injuring him.

Croatian forces adapted several <a href="Antonov%20An-2">Antonov An-2</a> biplanes to parachute supplies to Vukovar. The aircraft also dropped improvised bombs made of fuel cans and boilers filled with explosive and metal bars. The crews used <a href="Global%20Positioning%20System">GPS</a> to locate their targets, then pushed ordinance through the side door.

The European Community attempted to provide humanitarian aid to the 12,000 civilians trapped within the perimeter, but only one aid convoy made it through. On 12 October, the Croatians suspended military action to allow the convoy to pass, but the JNA used the pause as cover to make further military gains. Once the convoy set off, the JNA delayed it for two days and used the time to lay mines, bring in reinforcements and consolidate JNA control of the road out of Vukovar. When the convoy arrived, it delivered medical supplies to Vukovar's hospital and evacuated 114 wounded civilians.

On 16 October, the JNA mounted a major attack against Borovo Naselje. It made some progress, but became bogged down in the face of determined Croatian resistance. On 30 October, the JNA launched a fully coordinated assault, spearheaded by paramilitary forces, with infantry and engineering troops systematically forcing their way past the Croatian lines. The JNA's forces, divided into northern and southern operations sectors, attacked several points simultaneously and pushed the Croatians back. The JNA also adopted new tactics, such as firing directly into houses and then driving tanks through them, as well as using <a href="tear%20gas">tear gas</a> and <a href="smoke%20bomb">smoke bomb</a>s to drive out those inside. Buildings were also captured with the use of anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns.

On 2 November, the JNA reached the strategic suburb of Lužac, between Borovo Naselje and Vukovar, cutting one of the two roads linking the town centre with its northern suburb. Meanwhile, the ZNG (which had been renamed the <a href="Croatian%20Army">Croatian Army</a>) attempted to retake the villages of Marinci and <a href="Ceri%C4%87">Cerić</a> to reopen the supply route to Vukovar. It mounted a heavy bombardment of the JNA's access routes to Vukovar and launched a tank attack on the JNA's lines. On 4 November, JNA General Mladen Bratić was killed when his tank was hit by a shell. The JNA's advantage in artillery and rockets enabled it to halt the Croatian advance and inflict heavy casualties.

JNA troops launched an amphibious assault across the Danube north of Lužac on 3 November to link up with Arkan's paramilitary "Tigers". This attack split the Croatian perimeter in half and divided the main group of defenders in the town centre from a smaller stronghold in Borovo Naselje. The JNA's Operational Group South began systematically clearing the town centre, cutting off the remaining Croatian soldiers. They captured a key hilltop, Milova Brda, on 9 November, giving them a clear view of the town. The assault was spearheaded by paramilitary troops, with JNA and TO soldiers providing support, especially in demining operations and close artillery support. The Croatian-held village of <a href="Bogdanovci">Bogdanovci</a>, just west of Vukovar, fell on 10 November. As many as 87 Croat civilians were killed following its capture. On 13 November, the JNA cut the last link between Borovo Naselje and Vukovar. Croatian forces outside the Vukovar perimeter mounted a last-ditch attempt to break the siege by attacking from the village of <a href="Nu%C5%A1tar">Nuštar</a>, but were repelled by the JNA once again. By now, the Croatians were running out of ammunition and were exhausted from fighting around the clock without any prospect of relief. They had been reduced to three separate pockets. With defeat now inevitable, several hundred Croatian soldiers and civilians attempted to break out over the course of several days, as the JNA mounted its final offensive. Most of those in Borovo Naselje were unable to do so and were killed. On 18 November, the last Croatian soldiers in Vukovar's town centre surrendered.

By 18 November, many of Vukovar's civilian inhabitants were living in squalid conditions and nearing starvation. One woman told UN Special Envoy <a href="Cyrus%20Vance">Cyrus Vance</a> that she had spent the two previous months in a bomb shelter with her five children without toilets or water for washing. They lived on two slices of bread and a piece of pâté per day. One of the Croatian soldiers described conditions as the battle reached its peak:

When the battle ended, the scale of the town's destruction shocked many who had not left their shelters in weeks. <a href="Sini%C5%A1a%20Glava%C5%A1evi%C4%87">Siniša Glavašević</a>, a reporter for <a href="Croatian%20Radio">Croatian Radio</a> and a native of Vukovar, who had stayed in the town throughout the battle, described the scene as the survivors emerged:

Although active combat had ended in central Vukovar by 18 November, sporadic fighting continued for several days elsewhere in the town. Some Croatian soldiers continued to resist until 20 November and a few managed to slip away from Borovo Naselje as late as 23 November. Foreign journalists and international monitors entered the town soon after the surrender and recorded what they saw. Blaine Harden of the "<a href="Washington%20Post">Washington Post</a>" wrote:

<a href="Chuck%20Sudetic">Chuck Sudetic</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" reported:

<a href="Laura%20Silber">Laura Silber</a> and the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s <a href="Allan%20Little">Allan Little</a> described how "corpses of people and animals littered the streets. Grisly skeletons of buildings still burned, barely a square inch had escaped damage. Serbian volunteers, wild-eyed, roared down the streets, their pockets full of looted treasures." The JNA celebrated its victory, as Marc Champion of "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" described:

Croatia suffered heavy military and civilian casualties. The Croatian side initially reported 1,798 killed in the siege, both soldiers and civilians. Croatian general Anton Tus later stated that about 1,100 Croatian soldiers were killed, and 2,600 soldiers and civilians were listed as missing. Another 1,000 Croatian soldiers were killed on the approaches to Vinkovci and Osijek, according to Tus. He noted that the fighting was so intense that losses in eastern Slavonia between September and November 1991 constituted half of all Croatian war casualties from that year. According to figures published in 2006 by the Croatian Ministry of Defence, 879 Croatian soldiers were killed and 770 wounded in Vukovar. The <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) estimates Croatian casualties at around 4,000–5,000 dead across eastern Slavonia as a whole. The 204th Vukovar Brigade lost over 60 percent of its strength in the battle. The CIA reports that 1,131 civilians were killed over the course of the fighting. According to Croatian officials, in eastern Slavonia, 2,000 Croatians were killed, 800 went missing, 3,000 were taken prisoner and 42,852 were made refugees by the end of 1991.

Although JNA losses were undoubtedly substantial, the exact numbers are unclear because of a lack of official data. The JNA officially acknowledged 1,279 killed in action, including 177 officers, during the entire war in Croatia. The military historian Norman Cigar contends that the actual number may have been considerably greater as casualties were consistently under-reported during the war. According to Tus, the JNA's Novi Sad corps alone lost 1,300 soldiers during the campaign in eastern Slavonia. He extrapolates from this to estimate that between 6,000 and 8,000 soldiers and volunteers died in eastern Slavonia, with the loss of 600 armoured vehicles and heavy weapons, as well as over 20 aircraft.

Serbian sources disagree with this assessment. Following the war, Colonel Milisav Sekulić said that the battle resulted in the deaths of 1,180 JNA soldiers and TO personnel. General Andrija Biorčević, the former commander of the Novi Sad corps, remarked that there were "[not] more than 1,500 killed on our side." This sentiment was echoed by JNA General Života Panić, who shared a similar figure. In 1997, the journalist <a href="Miroslav%20Lazanski">Miroslav Lazanski</a>, who has close ties to the Serbian military, wrote in the Belgrade newspaper "<a href="Ve%C4%8Dernje%20novosti">Večernje novosti</a>" that "on the side of the JNA, Territorial Defence and volunteer units, exactly 1,103 members were killed." He cited losses of 110 armoured vehicles and two combat aircraft shot down, plus another destroyed due to technical failure. At the time, Lazanski's assessment was endorsed by three retired JNA generals. According to Croatian Serb sources, 350 Vukovar Serbs perished in the battle, including 203 TO fighters and 147 civilians.

Many captured Croatian soldiers and civilians were summarily executed after the battle. Journalists witnessed one such killing in Vukovar's main street. They also reported seeing the streets strewn with bodies in civilian attire. BBC television reporters recorded Serbian paramilitaries chanting: ""Slobodane, Slobodane, šalji nam salate, biće mesa, biće mesa, klaćemo Hrvate!"" ("Slobodan [Milošević], Slobodan, send us some salad, [for] there will be meat, there will be meat, we will slaughter Croats"). A Serbian journalist embedded with the JNA reserve forces in Vukovar later reported:

Around 400 people from Vukovar's hospital – non-Serb patients, medical personnel, local political figures and others who had taken refuge there – were taken by the JNA. Although some were subsequently released, around 200 were transported to the nearby <a href="Ov%C4%8Dara%20camp">Ovčara farm</a> and executed in what became known as the <a href="Vukovar%20massacre">Vukovar massacre</a>. At least 50 others were taken elsewhere and never seen again. Thousands more were transferred to prison camps in Serbia and rebel-controlled Croatia. Further mass killings followed; at <a href="Dalj">Dalj</a>, north of Vukovar, where many inhabitants were <a href="Dalj%20massacre">previously massacred</a>, numerous prisoners from Vukovar were subjected to harsh interrogations, beatings and torture, and at least 35 were killed. The JNA imprisoned 2,000 people at the <a href="Velepromet%20concentration%20camp">Velepromet</a> industrial facility in Vukovar, 800 of whom were classified by the JNA as prisoners of war. Many were brutally interrogated, several were shot on the spot by TO members and paramilitaries, and others were sent to Ovčara, where they were killed in the massacre. The remaining prisoners were transferred to a <a href="Sremska%20Mitrovica%20camp">JNA-run prison camp</a> in <a href="Sremska%20Mitrovica">Sremska Mitrovica</a>. They were stripped naked on arrival, beaten and interrogated, and forced to sleep for weeks on bare wooden floors. Most were released in January 1992 under an agreement brokered by UN envoy Cyrus Vance. Others were kept prisoner until mid-1992. Serbs who fought on the Croatian side were regarded as traitors by their captors and treated particularly harshly, enduring savage beatings.

Detainees who were not suspected of involvement in military activities were evacuated from Vukovar to other locations in Serbia and Croatia. The non-Serb population of the town and the surrounding region was systematically ethnically cleansed, and at least 20,000 of Vukovar's inhabitants were forced to leave, adding to the tens of thousands already expelled from across eastern Slavonia. About 2,600 people went missing as a result of the battle. , the whereabouts of more than 440 of these individuals are unknown. There were also incidents of <a href="war%20rape">war rape</a>, for which two soldiers were later convicted.

Serb forces singled out a number of prominent individuals. Among them was Dr. <a href="Vesna%20Bosanac">Vesna Bosanac</a>, the director of the town's hospital, who was regarded as a heroine in Croatia but demonised by the Serbian media. She and her husband were taken to Sremska Mitrovica prison, where she was locked up in a single room with more than 60 other women for several weeks. Her husband was subjected to repeated beatings. After appeals from the <a href="International%20Committee%20of%20the%20Red%20Cross">International Committee of the Red Cross</a>, the couple were eventually released in a prisoner exchange. The journalist Siniša Glavašević was taken to Ovčara, severely beaten and shot along with the other victims of the massacre.

Vukovar was systematically looted after its capture. A JNA soldier who fought at Vukovar told the Serbian newspaper "Dnevni Telegraf" that "the Chetnik [paramilitaries] behaved like professional plunderers, they knew what to look for in the houses they looted." The JNA also participated in the looting; an official in the Serbian Ministry of Defence commented: "Tell me of even one reservist, especially if he is an officer, who has spent more than a month at the front and has not brought back a fine car filled with everything that would fit inside the car." More than 8,000 works of art were looted during the battle, including the contents of the municipal museum, <a href="Eltz%20Manor">Eltz Castle</a>, which was bombed and destroyed during the siege. Serbia returned 2,000 pieces of looted art in December 2001.

Three JNA officers – Mile Mrkšić, Veselin Šljivančanin and <a href="Miroslav%20Radi%C4%87">Miroslav Radić</a> – were indicted by the <a href="International%20Criminal%20Tribunal%20for%20the%20Former%20Yugoslavia">International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) on multiple counts of <a href="crimes%20against%20humanity">crimes against humanity</a> and violations of the <a href="laws%20of%20war">laws of war</a>, having surrendered or been captured in 2002 and 2003. On 27 September 2007, Mrkšić was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment on charges of murder and torture, Šljivančanin was sentenced to five years' imprisonment for torture and Radić was acquitted. Šljivančanin's sentence was increased to 17 years on appeal. It was reduced to ten years after a second appeal and he was granted early release in July 2011. <a href="Slavko%20Dokmanovi%C4%87">Slavko Dokmanović</a>, the Serb mayor of Vukovar, was also indicted and arrested for his role in the massacre, but committed suicide in June 1998, shortly before judgement was to be passed.

Serbian paramilitary leader Vojislav Šešelj was indicted on war crimes charges, including several counts of extermination, for the Vukovar hospital massacre, in which his "White Eagles" were allegedly involved. In March 2016, Šešelj was acquitted on all counts pending appeal. On 11 April 2018, the Appeals Chamber of the follow-up <a href="Mechanism%20for%20International%20Criminal%20Tribunals">Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals</a> convicted him of crimes against humanity and sentenced him to 10 years in prison for a speech delivered in May 1992 in which he called for the <a href="Persecution%20of%20Croats%20in%20Serbia%20during%20Yugoslav%20Wars">expulsion of Croats from Vojvodina</a>. He was acquitted of the war crimes and crimes against humanity that he was alleged to have committed elsewhere, including in Vukovar. 

The ICTY's indictment of Slobodan Milošević characterised the overall JNA and Serb offensive in Croatia – including the fighting in eastern Slavonia – as a "<a href="joint%20criminal%20enterprise">joint criminal enterprise</a>" to remove non-Serb populations from Serb-inhabited areas of Croatia. Milošević was charged with numerous crimes against humanity, violations of the laws of war, and breaches of the <a href="Geneva%20Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> in relation to the battle and its aftermath. He died in March 2006, before his trial could be completed. The Croatian Serb leader <a href="Goran%20Had%C5%BEi%C4%87">Goran Hadžić</a> was indicted for "wanton destruction of homes, religious and cultural buildings" and "devastation not justified by military necessity" across eastern Slavonia, and for deporting Vukovar's non-Serb population. He was arrested in July 2011, after seven years on the run, and pleaded not guilty to 14 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity. He died in July 2016, before his trial could be completed.

In December 2005, a Serbian court convicted 14 former paramilitaries for their involvement in the hospital massacre. In 2011, a Serbian court indicted more than 40 Croatians for alleged war crimes committed in Vukovar. An earlier indictment against a Croatian soldier was dropped because of irregularities in the investigation. Croatia also indicted a number of Serbs for war crimes committed in Vukovar, including former JNA generals Veljko Kadijević and <a href="Blagoje%20Ad%C5%BEi%C4%87">Blagoje Adžić</a>. Adžić died of natural causes in Belgrade in March 2012 and never faced trial. Kadijević fled Yugoslavia following Milošević's overthrow and sought asylum in <a href="Russia">Russia</a>. He was granted <a href="Russian%20citizenship">Russian citizenship</a> in 2008 and died in <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a> in November 2014. In 1999, Croatia sued Yugoslavia before the <a href="International%20Court%20of%20Justice">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ), claiming that genocide had been committed in Vukovar. Following Serbia and Montenegro's dissolution in 2006, this suit was passed on to Serbia. In February 2015, the ICJ ruled that the battle and ensuing massacre did not constitute genocide, but affirmed that serious crimes had been committed by the JNA and Serb paramilitaries.

The Serbian and Croatian media waged a fierce propaganda struggle over the progress of the battle and the reasons behind it. Both sides' propaganda machines aimed to promote ultra-nationalist sentiments and denigrate the other side with no pretence of objectivity or self-criticism. The Croatian media described the Serbian forces as "Serb terrorists" and a "Serbo-Communist army of occupation" intent on crushing the thousand-year dream of an independent Croatia. The propaganda reached peak intensity in the wake of Vukovar's fall. The Croatian newspaper "<a href="Novi%20list">Novi list</a>" denounced the Serbs as "cannibals" and "brutal Serb extremists". The Serbian media depicted the JNA and Serbian forces as "liberators" and "defenders" of the Serbian people, and the Croatian forces as "Ustashoid hordes", "blackshirts", "militants" and "drunk and stoned monsters". There were overt appeals to racial and gender prejudice, including claims that Croatian combatants had "put on female dress to escape from the town" and had recruited "black men".

Victim status became a central aim for the propaganda machines of both sides, and the battle was used to support claims of atrocities. Victims became interchangeable as anonymous victims were identified as Croats by the Croatian media and as Serbs by the Serbian media. According to the Serbian opposition periodical "Republika", the state-owned station <a href="Radio%20Television%20of%20Vojvodina">TV Novi Sad</a> was under orders to identify any bodies its reporters filmed as being "Serbian corpses". After the battle, Belgrade television showed pictures of hundreds of corpses lined up outside Vukovar's hospital and claimed that they were Serbs who had been "massacred" by the Croats. According to <a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch">Human Rights Watch</a>, the bodies belonged to those who had died of their injuries at the hospital, whose staff had been prevented from burying them by the intense Serbian bombardment, and had been forced to leave them lying in the open. Serbian television continued to broadcast claims of "massacred Serbs in Vukovar" for some time after the town's fall.

Such victim-centred propaganda had a powerful motivating effect. One Serbian volunteer said that he had never seen the town before the war, but had come to fight because "the Croats had a network of catacombs under the city where they killed and tortured children just because they were Serbs." <a href="Reuters">Reuters</a> erroneously reported that <a href="Vukovar%20children%20massacre">41 children had been massacred</a> in Vukovar by Croatian soldiers. Although the claim was retracted a day later, it was used by the Serbian media to justify military action in Croatia. Many of those fighting at Vukovar believed that they were engaged in a struggle to liberate the town from a hostile occupier.

The international community made repeated unsuccessful attempts to end the fighting. Both sides violated ceasefires, often within hours. Calls by some European Community members for the <a href="Western%20European%20Union">Western European Union</a> to intervene militarily were vetoed by the United Kingdom. Instead, a Conference for Yugoslavia was established under the chairmanship of <a href="Peter%20Carington%2C%206th%20Baron%20Carrington">Lord Carrington</a> to find a way to end the conflict. The United Nations (UN) imposed an <a href="arms%20embargo">arms embargo</a> on all of the Yugoslav republics in September 1991 under <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%20713">Security Council Resolution 713</a>, but this was ineffective, in part because the JNA had no need to import weapons. The European powers abandoned attempts to keep Yugoslavia united and agreed to recognise the independence of Croatia and Slovenia on 15 January 1992.

International observers tried unsuccessfully to prevent the human rights abuses that followed the battle. A visit by UN envoys <a href="Marrack%20Goulding">Marrack Goulding</a> and Cyrus Vance was systematically obstructed by the JNA. Vance's demands to see the hospital, from which wounded patients were being dragged out to be killed, were rebuffed by one of the massacre's chief architects, Major Veselin Šljivančanin. The major also blocked Red Cross representatives in an angry confrontation recorded by TV cameras: "This is my country, we have conquered this. This is Yugoslavia, and I am in command here!"

There was no international media presence in Vukovar, as there was in the simultaneous <a href="Siege%20of%20Dubrovnik">Siege of Dubrovnik</a> and the subsequent <a href="Siege%20of%20Sarajevo">Siege of Sarajevo</a>, and relatively little of the fighting in Vukovar was broadcast to foreign audiences. The British journalist <a href="Misha%20Glenny">Misha Glenny</a> commented that the JNA, the Croatian Serb government and many ordinary Serbs were often hostile to the foreign media, while the Croatians were more open and friendly.

The Croatian media gave heavy coverage to the battle, repeatedly airing broadcasts from the besieged town by the journalist Siniša Glavašević. Much popular war art focused on the "VukoWAR", as posters dubbed it. The Croatian government began suppressing Glavašević's broadcasts when it became clear that defeat was inevitable, despite the confident slogans of "Vukovar shall not fall" and "Vukovar must not fall." Two of the main daily newspapers, "<a href="Ve%C4%8Dernji%20list">Večernji list</a>" and "Novi list", failed to report the loss of Vukovar and, on 20 November, two days after it had fallen, repeated the official line that the fight was still continuing. News of the surrender was dismissed as Serbian propaganda. Many Croatians soon saw Western satellite broadcasts of JNA soldiers and Serb paramilitaries walking freely through the town and detaining its inhabitants. When the surrender could no longer be denied, the two newspapers interpreted the loss as a demonstration of Croatian bravery and resistance, blaming the international community for not intervening to help Croatia.

The Croatian government was criticised for its approach to the battle. Surviving defenders and right-wing politicians accused the government of betraying and deliberately sacrificing Vukovar to secure Croatia's international recognition. The only explanation that many were willing to accept for the town's fall was that it had been given up as part of a conspiracy. The Croatian commanders in Vukovar, Mile Dedaković and Branko Borković, both survived the battle and spoke out publicly against the government's actions. In an apparent attempt to silence them, both men were briefly detained by the Croatian military police. The Croatian government also suppressed an issue of the newspaper "<a href="Slobodni%20tjednik">Slobodni tjednik</a>" that published a transcript of a telephone call from Vukovar, in which Dedaković had pleaded with an evasive Tuđman for military assistance. The revelations caused public outrage and reinforced perceptions that the defenders had been betrayed.

From a military point of view, the outcome at Vukovar was not a disaster for Croatia's overall war effort. The battle broke the back of the JNA, leaving it exhausted and unable to press deeper into the country. Vukovar was probably indefensible, being almost completely surrounded by Serb-held territory and located closer to Belgrade than to Zagreb. Although the defeat was damaging to Croatian morale, in a strategic context, the damage and delays inflicted on the JNA more than made up for the loss of the town.

Following the battle, Vukovar became a symbol of Croatian resistance and suffering. The survivors, veterans and journalists wrote numerous memoirs, songs and testimonies about the battle and its symbolism, calling it variously "the phenomenon", "the pride", "the hell" and "the Croatian knight". Writers appealed to the "Vukovar principle", the "spirituality of Vukovar" and "Vukovar ethics", the qualities said to have been exhibited by the defenders and townspeople. Croatian war veterans were presented with medals bearing the name of Vukovar. In 1994, when Croatia replaced the <a href="Croatian%20dinar">Croatian dinar</a> with its new currency, the <a href="Croatian%20kuna">kuna</a>, it used the destroyed Eltz Castle in Vukovar and the <a href="Vu%C4%8Dedol%20Dove">Vučedol Dove</a> – an artefact from an ancient Neolithic culture centred on eastern Slavonia, which was discovered near Vukovar – on the new twenty-kuna note. The imagery emphasised the Croatian nature of Vukovar, which at the time was under Serb control. In 1993 and 1994, there was a national debate on how Vukovar should be rebuilt following its reintegration into Croatia, with some Croatians suggesting that it should be preserved as a monument.

The ruling HDZ made extensive use of popular culture relating to Vukovar as propaganda in the years before the region was reintegrated into Croatia. In 1997, President Tuđman mounted a tour of eastern Slavonia, accompanied by a musical campaign called "Sve hrvatske pobjede za Vukovar" ("All Croatian victories for Vukovar"). The campaign was commemorated by the release of a compilation of patriotic music from <a href="Croatia%20Records">Croatia Records</a>. When Vukovar was returned to Croatian control in 1998, its recovery was hailed as the completion of a long struggle for freedom and Croatian national identity. Tuđman alluded to such sentiments when he gave a speech in Vukovar to mark its reintegration into Croatia:

Although the battle had been fought in the name of Serbian defence and unity, reactions in Serbia were deeply divided. The JNA, the state-controlled Serbian media and Serbian ultra-nationalists hailed the victory as a triumph. The JNA even erected a triumphal arch in Belgrade through which its returning soldiers could march, and officers were congratulated for taking "the toughest and fiercest Ustaša fortress". The Serbian newspaper "<a href="Politika">Politika</a>" ran a front-page headline on 20 November announcing: "Vukovar Finally Free". In January 1992, from the ruins of Vukovar, the ultranationalist painter <a href="Mili%C4%87%20od%20Ma%C4%8Dve">Milić Stanković</a> wrote an article for the Serbian periodical "<a href="Pogledi">Pogledi</a>" ("Viewpoints"), in which he declared: "Europe must know Vukovar was liberated from the Croat Nazis. They were helped by Central European scum. They crawled from under the <a href="papal%20tiara">papal tiara</a>, as a dart of the serpent's tongue that protruded from the bloated <a href="Kraut">Kraut</a> and overstretched Eurocommunal anus."

The Serbian geographer Jovan Ilić set out a vision for the future of the region, envisaging it being annexed to Serbia and its expelled Croatian population being replaced with Serbs from elsewhere in Croatia. The redrawing of Serbia's borders would unite all Serbs in a single state, and would cure Croats of opposition to Serbian nationalism, which Ilić termed an "ethno-psychic disorder"; thus, "the new borders should primarily be a therapy for the treatment of ethno-psychic disorders, primarily among the Croatian population." Other Serbian nationalist writers acknowledged that historical evidence was that eastern Slavonia had been Croatian for centuries, but accused the region's Croat majority of "conversion to Catholicism, <a href="Uniate">Uniating</a> and Croatisation", as well as "genocidal destruction". Most <a href="irrendentism">irredentist</a> propaganda focused on the region's proximity to Serbia and its sizeable Serb population.

The Croatian Serb leadership also took a positive view of the battle's outcome. Between 1991 and 1995, while Vukovar was under the control of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Serbian%20Krajina">Republic of Serbian Krajina</a> (RSK), the city's fall was officially commemorated as "Liberation Day". The battle was portrayed as a successful struggle by local Serbs to defend their lives and property from the aggression of the Croatian state. Thousands of Vukovar Serbs that had suffered alongside their Croatian neighbours, sheltering in basements or bomb shelters for three months in appalling conditions, were now denigrated as "podrumaši", the "people from the basement". Serb civilian dead were denied recognition, and the only people buried in the Serbian memorial cemetery at Vukovar were local Serbs who had fought with or alongside the JNA.

In contrast, many in Serbia were strongly opposed to the battle and the wider war, and resisted efforts by the state to involve them in the conflict. When the JNA tried to call up reservists, parents and relatives gathered around barracks to prevent their children taking part in the operation. Resistance to conscription became widespread across Serbia, ranging from individual acts of defiance to collective mutinies by hundreds of reservists at a time. A number of Serbian opposition politicians condemned the war. Desimir Tošić of the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28Serbia%29">Democratic Party</a> accused Milošević of "using the conflict to cling to power", and <a href="Vuk%20Dra%C5%A1kovi%C4%87">Vuk Drašković</a>, the leader of the <a href="Serbian%20Renewal%20Movement">Serbian Renewal Movement</a>, appealed to JNA soldiers to "pick up their guns and run". After the fall of Vukovar, he condemned what had been done in the name of Yugoslavia, writing in the daily newspaper "<a href="Borba%20%28newspaper%29">Borba</a>":

By late December 1991, just over a month after victory had been proclaimed in Vukovar, opinion polls found that 64 percent wanted to end the war immediately and only 27 percent were willing for it to continue. Milošević and other senior Serbian leaders decided against continuing the fighting, as they saw it as politically impossible to mobilise more conscripts to fight in Croatia. Desertions from the JNA continued as the well-motivated and increasingly well-equipped Croatian Army became more difficult to counter. By the end of 1991, Serbia's political and military leadership concluded that it would be counter-productive to continue the war. The looming conflict in Bosnia also required that the military resources tied up in Croatia be freed for future use.

Although the battle was publicly portrayed as a triumph, it profoundly affected the JNA's character and leadership behind the scenes. The army's leaders realised that they had overestimated their ability to pursue operations against heavily defended urban targets, such as the strategic central Croatian town of <a href="Gospi%C4%87">Gospić</a>, which the JNA assessed as potentially a "second Vukovar". The "Serbianisation" of the army was greatly accelerated, and, by the end of 1991, it was estimated to be 90 percent Serb. Its formerly pro-communist, pan-Yugoslav identity was abandoned, and new officers were now advised to "love, above all else, their unit, their army and their homeland – Serbia and Montenegro". The JNA's failure enabled the Serbian government to tighten its control over the military, whose leadership was purged and replaced with pro-Milošević nationalists. After the battle, General Veljko Kadijević, commander of the JNA, was forced into retirement for "health reasons", and in early 1992, another 38 generals and other officers were forced to retire, with several put on trial for incompetence and treason.

Many individual JNA soldiers who took part in the battle were revolted by what they had seen and protested to their superiors about the behaviour of the paramilitaries. Colonel Milorad Vučić later commented that "they simply do not want to die for such things". The atrocities that they witnessed led some to experience subsequent feelings of trauma and guilt. A JNA veteran told a journalist from the Arabic newspaper "<a href="Asharq%20Al-Awsat">Asharq Al-Awsat</a>":

In Bosnia and Herzegovina, President <a href="Alija%20Izetbegovi%C4%87">Alija Izetbegović</a> made a televised appeal to Bosnian citizens to refuse the draft on the grounds that "this is not our war". He called it their "right and duty" to resist the "evil deeds" being committed in Croatia and said: "Let those who want it, wage it. We do not want this war." When JNA troops transferred to the front via the <a href="Vi%C5%A1egrad">Višegrad</a> region of north-eastern Bosnia, local Bosnian Croats and Muslims set up barricades and machine-gun posts. They halted a column of 60 JNA tanks but were dispersed by force the following day. More than 1,000 people had to flee the area. This action, nearly seven months before the start of the <a href="Bosnian%20War">Bosnian War</a>, caused the first casualties of the Yugoslav Wars in Bosnia.

Macedonia's parliament adopted a declaration of independence from Yugoslavia in January 1991, but it did not take effect until a referendum in September 1991 confirmed it. A group of Macedonian JNA officers secretly sought to prevent soldiers from Macedonia being sent to Croatia, and busloads of soldiers' parents, funded by the Macedonian government, travelled to Montenegro to find their sons and bring them home. Meanwhile, Macedonians continued to be conscripted into the JNA and serve in the war in Croatia. The commander of JNA forces in the first phase of the battle, General Aleksandar Spirkovski, was a Macedonian. His ethnicity was probably a significant factor in the decision to replace him with Života Panić, a Serb. In 2005, the Macedonian Army's Chief of Staff, General Miroslav Stojanovski, became the focus of international controversy after it was alleged that he had been involved in possible war crimes following the battle.

Vukovar suffered catastrophic damage in the battle. Croatian officials estimated that 90 percent of its housing stock was damaged or destroyed, accounting for 15,000 housing units in total. The authorities placed the cost of reconstruction at $2.5 billion. The town barely recovered during its seven years under Serb control. Marcus Tanner of "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" described post-battle Vukovar as:

When <a href="Michael%20Ignatieff">Michael Ignatieff</a> visited Vukovar in 1992, he found the inhabitants living in squalor:

The population increased to about 20,000 as Serb refugees from other parts of Croatia and Bosnia were relocated by RSK authorities. They initially lived without water or electricity, in damaged buildings patched up with plastic sheeting and wooden boards. Residents scavenged the ruins for fragments of glass that they could stick back together to make windows for themselves. The main sources of income were <a href="war%20profiteering">war profiteering</a> and smuggling, though some were able to find jobs in eastern Slavonia's revived oil industry. Reconstruction was greatly delayed by economic sanctions and lack of international aid.

After the <a href="Erdut%20Agreement">Erdut Agreement</a> was signed in 1995, the <a href="United%20Nations%20Transitional%20Authority%20for%20Eastern%20Slavonia%2C%20Baranja%20and%20Western%20Sirmium">United Nations Transitional Authority for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium</a> (UNTAES) was established to enable the return of Croatian refugees and to prepare the region for reintegration into Croatia. This UN peacekeeping force provided security during the transition period between 1996 and 1998. It was only in 1999 that Croats began returning to Vukovar in significant numbers, and many of the pre-war inhabitants never returned. By March 2001, the municipality was recorded as having 31,670 inhabitants – less than half the pre-war total – of whom 18,199 (57.46%) were Croats and 10,412 (32.88%) were Serbs. The community did not recover its mixed character: Croats and Serbs now lived separate social lives. Public facilities such as shops, cafés, restaurants, sports clubs, schools, non-governmental organisations and radio stations were re-established on segregated lines, with separate facilities for each community.

Although the Croatian government sponsored reconstruction efforts in and around Vukovar, the Serb-populated town centre remained in ruins until 2003. Both Croat and Serb residents believed the government had neglected it deliberately, in order to punish the Serb community. <a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch">Human Rights Watch</a> noted that, of 4,000 homes that had been rebuilt, none of them were inhabited by Serbs. Unemployment was high because of the destruction of the town's major industries, and many of the inhabitants could not sell their houses. Most houses and many of Vukovar's historic buildings had been restored by 2011.

Signs of the battle are still widely apparent in Vukovar, where many buildings remain visibly scarred by bullets and shrapnel. The <a href="Vukovar%20water%20tower">riverside water tower</a> has been preserved in its badly damaged state as a memorial. The town hospital presents an exhibition and reconstruction of the conditions in the building during the battle. At Ovčara, the site of the massacre is marked by a mass grave and exhibition about the atrocity. Local guides, some of whom lived through the battle, offer tourists the opportunity to visit these and other sites on walking and bicycle tours.

Every November, Vukovar's authorities hold four days of festivities to commemorate the town's fall, culminating in a "Procession of Memory" held on 18 November. This represents the expulsion of the town's Croat inhabitants and involves a five-kilometre (3.1 mile) walk from the city's hospital to the Croatian Memorial Cemetery of Homeland War Victims. It is attended by tens of thousands of people from across Croatia. Local Serbs have avoided participating in the Croatian commemorations, often preferring either to leave the town or stay indoors on 18 November. Until 2003, they held a separate, low-key commemoration at the Serbian military cemetery on 17 November. Such commemorations have been held on 18 November since then. The RSK-era term "Liberation Day" has been dropped, but Serbs also avoid using the Croatian terminology, instead calling it simply "18 November". The issue of how to remember the Serb dead has posed particular difficulties. Local Serbs who died fighting alongside the JNA were buried by the Croatian Serb authorities on a plot of land where Croatian houses had once stood. The gravestones were originally topped with a sculptural evocation of the V-shaped Serbian military cap, or "<a href="%C5%A1ajka%C4%8Da">šajkača</a>". After Vukovar's reintegration into Croatia, the gravestones were repeatedly vandalised. The Serb community replaced them with more neutral gravestones without overt military connotations. Vukovar Serbs report feeling marginalised and excluded from places associated with Croatian nationalist sentiment, such as war monuments. The Croatian sociologist Kruno Kardov gives the example of a prominent memorial, a large cross made from white stone, where the <a href="Vuka%20%28river%29">Vuka</a> flows into the Danube. According to Kardov, Serbs rarely if ever go there, and they feel great stress if they do. A Serb boy spoke of how he wanted to know what was written on the monument but was too frightened to go and read the inscription; one day he got up the courage, ran to the monument, read it and immediately ran back to "safety". As Kardov puts it, Vukovar remains divided by an "invisible boundary line ... inscribed only on the cognitive map of the members of one particular group."

The battle is widely commemorated in Croatia. Almost every town has streets named after Vukovar. In 2009, the lead vessel of the <a href="Croatian%20Navy">Croatian Navy</a>'s two newly launched <a href="Helsinki%20class%20missile%20boat">"Helsinki"-class missile boat</a>s was named after the town. The Croatian Parliament has declared 18 November to be the "Remembrance Day of the Sacrifice of Vukovar in 1991", when "all those who participated in the defence of the city of Vukovar – the symbol of Croatian freedom – are appropriately honoured with dignity." 

As a symbol of Croatia's national identity, Vukovar has become a place of pilgrimage for people from across Croatia who seek to evoke feelings of "vicarious insideness", as Kardov describes them, in the suffering endured during the country's war of independence. Some gather in front of the town's main memorial cross on New Year's Eve to pray as the year ends, though such sentiments have attracted criticism from local Croats for not allowing them to "rejoice for even a single night", as one put it. The town has thus become, in Kardov's words, "the embodiment of a pure Croatian identity" and the battle "the foundational myth of the Croatian state". This has led to it becoming as much an "imagined place", a receptacle for Croatian national sentiment and symbolism, as a real place. Kardov concludes that it is questionable whether Vukovar can ever once again be "one place for all its citizens".

In November 2010, <a href="Boris%20Tadi%C4%87">Boris Tadić</a> became the first President of Serbia to travel to Vukovar, when he visited the massacre site at Ovčara and expressed his "apology and regret".

The battle was portrayed in the Serbian films "Dezerter" ("The Deserter") (1992), "Kaži zašto me ostavi" ("Why Have You Left Me?") (1993) and "<a href="Vukovar%2C%20jedna%20pri%C4%8Da">Vukovar, jedna priča</a>" ("Vukovar: A Story") (1994); in the Croatian films "" ("Vukovar: The Way Home") (1994) and "Zapamtite Vukovar" ("Remember Vukovar") (2008); and in the French film "<a href="Harrison%27s%20Flowers">Harrison's Flowers</a>" (2000). A 2006 Serbian documentary film about the battle, "Vukovar – Final Cut", won the Human Rights Award at the 2006 <a href="Sarajevo%20Film%20Festival">Sarajevo Film Festival</a>. The battle is also at the centre of Serbian writer <a href="Vladimir%20Arsenijevi%C4%87">Vladimir Arsenijević</a>'s 1995 novel "U potpalublju" ("In the Hold").

Jack Crawford (cricketer)

John Neville "Jack" Crawford (1 December 1886 – 2 May 1963) was an English <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class</a> <a href="cricket">cricket</a>er who played mainly for <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a> and <a href="South%20Australia%20cricket%20team">South Australia</a>. An <a href="Amateur%20status%20in%20first-class%20cricket">amateur</a>, he played as an <a href="all-rounder">all-rounder</a>. As a right-handed batsman, Crawford had a reputation for scoring quickly and hitting powerful shots. He bowled <a href="Fast%20bowling%23Categorisation%20of%20fast%20bowling">medium-paced</a> <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a> and was noted for his accuracy and his ability to make the ball turn sharply from the pitch. Unusually for a first-class cricketer, Crawford wore spectacles while playing.

Crawford established a reputation as an outstanding cricketer while still a schoolboy. He played <a href="Test%20cricket">Test cricket</a> for <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England</a> before he was 21 years old, and successfully toured Australia with the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC) in 1907–08. He played only 12 matches for England, although critics believed he had a great future in the sport and was a potential future England captain. In two successive English seasons, he completed the <a href="Double%20%28cricket%29">double</a> of 1,000 <a href="Run%20%28cricket%29">runs</a> and 100 <a href="Wicket%23Dismissing%20a%20batsman">wickets</a> in first-class games.

A dispute over the composition of a Surrey side chosen to play a high-profile game in 1909, after several professional players were omitted for disciplinary reasons, led to an increasingly bitter argument between Crawford and the Surrey authorities. Crawford was told he had no future with the club, and moved to Australia. There, he worked as a teacher and continued his cricket career with South Australia. This arrangement had a controversial end, when he clashed with the <a href="South%20Australian%20Cricket%20Association">South Australian Cricket Association</a> over money and moved to New Zealand to play for <a href="Otago%20cricket%20team">Otago</a>.

That relationship also ended badly, and he left Otago before being conscripted into the New Zealand armed forces near the end of the First World War. When he was demobilised, he returned to England and made his peace with Surrey. He played a handful of games between 1919 and 1921 but faded out of first-class cricket to pursue a career in industry. In all first-class cricket, Crawford scored 9,488 runs at an <a href="Batting%20average%23Cricket">average</a> of 32.60 and took 815 wickets at an <a href="Bowling%20average">average</a> of 20.66. Although he continued to play cricket at a lower level, the remainder of Crawford's life passed in relative obscurity.

Jack Crawford was born on 1 December 1886 at Cane Hill, <a href="Coulsdon">Coulsdon</a>, <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a>, the youngest of three sons of the Rev <a href="John%20Crawford%20%28cricketer%29">John Charles Crawford</a> and his wife Alice; the couple also had three daughters. Crawford senior was the chaplain at the recently opened <a href="Cane%20Hill%20Hospital">Cane Hill Asylum</a>, in the grounds of which Crawford was born. He grew up in a cricketing environment. His father and uncle, <a href="Frank%20Fairbairn%20Crawford">Frank Crawford</a>, played <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a> for <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent</a>; his brothers <a href="Vivian%20Crawford">Vivian</a> and <a href="Reginald%20Crawford%20%28cricketer%29">Reginald</a> were also first-class cricketers. The whole family played cricket and encouraged Crawford from a young age, and from the age of eleven he regularly played with adults.

After attending Glengrove School in <a href="Eastbourne">Eastbourne</a>, Crawford went to St Winifred's School in <a href="Henley-on-Thames">Henley-on-Thames</a> where, in his two years in the cricket team, he scored 2,093 <a href="Run%20%28cricket%29">runs</a> and took 366 <a href="Wicket%23Dismissing%20a%20batsman">wickets</a>. In 1902, Crawford moved to <a href="Repton%20School">Repton School</a>. Reaching the cricket team in his first year, he remained in the eleven until he left the school in 1905. His impact was considerable. A 1906 report in "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a>" rated him as one of the best three schoolboy cricketers in the previous 40 years, only matched by <a href="A.%20G.%20Steel">A. G. Steel</a> and <a href="Stanley%20Jackson">Stanley Jackson</a>. Cricket historians similarly praised his cricket at Repton. <a href="Benny%20Green%20%28saxophonist%29">Benny Green</a> notes that his prolific achievements "created ... chaos among schoolboy cricketers." <a href="Gerald%20Brodribb">Gerald Brodribb</a> describes him as "probably the best ever" schoolboy cricketer.

By 1904, Crawford dominated the Repton team. He scored 759 runs and his 75 wickets were more than the combined total of all the other bowlers in the team. He was particularly effective in the school's most important fixtures. The report in "Wisden" described him as possibly the best <a href="Amateur%20status%20in%20first-class%20cricket">amateur</a> bowler in England that year: he bowled medium-paced <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a>, although he varied the speed of his delivery from slow to fast. <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey County Cricket Club</a> took an interest in Crawford almost immediately, calling him to a trial in 1903. Following his achievements in 1904, he was invite to play for the county. The county club was in the midst of a spell of uncertainty; several men captained the team, but only for a handful of matches each. The composition of the side continually changed, and the team performed poorly, causing unrest among supporters accustomed to success. Crawford was just one of many players brought in as an experiment, albeit one of the most successful. He made his first-class debut against Kent. Taking three wickets and top-scoring in Surrey's first innings with 54, Crawford did well enough to retain his place for another seven games, and was praised in the press for his performances. Against <a href="Gloucestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Gloucestershire</a>, he took seven wickets for 43 runs in the second innings, and a total of ten wickets in the match. In the season as a whole he took 44 first-class wickets at an average of 16.93 to top the county's bowling averages, and scored 229 runs at an average of 16.35.

Although hampered by injuries during the 1905 season for Repton, his last at the school, Crawford scored 766 runs with a batting average of 85. In the five matches in which he was fit to bowl he took 55 wickets at an average under 13. In the August holidays, he returned to play for Surrey. In his second game, he took seven for 90 against <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a> and in his third, he scored his maiden first-class century—119 <a href="not%20out">not out</a> against <a href="Derbyshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Derbyshire</a>—to become the youngest centurion for the county, a record that was not broken until 2013. Later, he took eight for 24 against <a href="Northamptonshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Northamptonshire</a> and scored 142 not out against <a href="Leicestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Leicestershire</a>. At the end of the season, he played in the Hastings Festival, appearing in several representative games for teams representing the South of England and played for the Rest of England against the <a href="County%20Championship">County Champions</a> Yorkshire. Crawford finished second in Surrey's batting averages for 1905; in all first-class games he scored 543 runs at an average of 33.93 and took 47 wickets at an average of 18.46. As the season ended, he was invited by the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC) to join their tour of South Africa that winter.

Having finished his school career, Crawford joined the first MCC tour of South Africa in the 1905–06 season. The team was not particularly strong—before the tour, critics judged it to possess the equivalent strength of a moderate county side. The MCC was criticised by the press in both England and South Africa for omitting many of the strongest players. As the youngest member of the team, Crawford was given the traditional role of writing press reports to be sent back home during the tour. When the team played in <a href="Worcester%2C%20Western%20Cape">Worcester</a> during the tour, the local press carried a report that Crawford planned to remain in South Africa. The 1906 "Wisden" carried the same story; in a comment on his success in 1905, it suggested that it was uncertain for how long he would play, and questioned whether, if he played Test cricket, he would do so for England or South Africa. The cricket historian Nigel Hart queries why "Wisden" mentioned South Africa; Crawford's only known connection came through his uncle, who had left South Africa five years before.

In all first-class matches on the tour, Crawford scored 531 runs at an average of 31.23, coming third in the tour batting averages, and took 34 wickets at an average of 18.44, placing him fifth among the regular bowlers in the team. In the early tour matches, Crawford recorded two <a href="Glossary%20of%20cricket%20terms%23F">five wicket hauls</a> and scored 98. He made his <a href="Test%20cricket">Test match</a> debut for England against <a href="South%20Africa%20national%20cricket%20team">South Africa</a> in the first Test at the age of 19 years and 32 days to become England's youngest Test cricketer, a record he held until <a href="Brian%20Close">Brian Close</a> made his debut in 1949. Batting at <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Middle%20order">number six</a>, Crawford scored 44 runs in the first innings and 43 in the second; he took a wicket with his first delivery, bowling <a href="Bert%20Vogler">Bert Vogler</a>. He was wicketless in the second innings, and bowled inaccurately as the home side recorded a one-wicket win. "Wisden" noted that Crawford batted well in both innings. After a month of cricket in between the Tests, during which Crawford scored 212 in a minor game, the English team were suffering from fatigue when the remaining matches were played. In the second Test, Crawford was promoted to <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Opening%20batsmen">open the batting</a>, a position he retained for most of the series. In the final match, he scored 74, his first Test fifty and the highest score of his Test career. His best bowling also came in the final match, where he took three for 69.

In the Test series, Crawford scored 281 runs at an average of 31.22 and took nine wickets at 35.77. England lost the series 4–1, finding it difficult to bat against the South African <a href="googly">googly</a> bowlers. "Wisden's" tour report described Crawford's batting as one of the few positives for his side. Writing home during the tour, the MCC captain <a href="Pelham%20Warner">Pelham Warner</a> frequently praised Crawford and the extent of his ability at a young age. The English press even parodied what Crawford's biographer, Michael Burns, describes as Warner's "near-obsession" with Crawford. Other critics believed that Crawford should have been more successful as a bowler but was distracted by the matting surfaces used in South Africa; because he was able to make the ball bounce and turn extravagantly from the surface, he tried to spin the ball too much and lost accuracy as a result.

Returning to England for the 1906 season, Crawford completed the <a href="Double%20%28cricket%29">double</a> of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in first-class cricket, the youngest player at the time to accomplish this feat. Against Gloucestershire, he scored 148 and then took seven for 85 and four for 63 with the ball; he also took ten wickets in his next game. In total, he compiled 1,174 runs at an average of 30.10, and took 118 wickets at an average of 20.28. These performances earned him selection for the representative <a href="Gentlemen%20v%20Players">Gentlemen versus Players</a> matches at both <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a> and <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a>, in which he played for the amateur Gentlemen. At the end of the season, he was chosen as one of "Wisden's" <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">Cricketers of the Year</a>. The citation said: "Few cricketers have won equal fame at so early an age", and noted the unusual ease with which he had moved into first-class cricket. Crawford's powerful batting and straight hitting were praised, as was his accurate bowling. The report also stated: "That he should have done all this is the more astonishing from the fact that he invariably plays in glasses. No one handicapped in this way has ever been so consistently successful both as batsman and bowler."

Crawford had a reputation by this stage as a batsman who favoured aggressive, powerful shots and his performances drew in crowds. In 1907, in the space of a few days, he hit deliveries in two different matches through the windows of both the home and the visitors' dressing rooms at The Oval. Towards the end of the season, he scored 103 runs in 90 minutes against <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent</a>, his only century that year, hitting several deliveries into the crowd; "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" described the ball in this innings as "soaring away like a bird". Crawford's overall batting record was similar to the previous season: he scored 1,158 runs at an average of 30.47. With the ball, he took 124 wickets at 16.95, completing his second double. Once again, he was selected in both Gentlemen v Players matches, taking six for 54 in the second, and was chosen to play two of the three Test matches against South Africa. These were his only Test matches in England; he scored 26 runs in three innings and was wicketless after bowling 29 <a href="Over%20%28cricket%29">overs</a>. He missed England's victory in the second match, the only match in the series not to be a draw, but "Wisden's" correspondent believed that the pitch conditions for that game made it a mistake to leave Crawford out. Despite his lack of success in the Tests, Crawford was invited to tour Australia that winter even before the South African series was complete; he suggested to the press that he might remain in Australia after the tour.

The MCC team which <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201907%E2%80%9308">toured Australia in 1907—08</a>, like that which toured South Africa, faced questions about its strength. Because at least four first-choice players chose not to tour, and another was not selected despite strong claims, the team was less representative than usual for an <a href="The%20Ashes">Ashes series</a>. The tourists lost the Tests 4–1, although "Wisden" suggested that the series was more competitive than suggested by the results.

Crawford began the tour well, taking seven wickets in the opening first-class match against <a href="Western%20Australia%20cricket%20team">Western Australia</a>. In the second game, he scored 114 runs in 58 minutes against <a href="South%20Australia%20cricket%20team">South Australia</a>, the fastest first-class century scored in Australia until then, followed by bowling figures of five for 40 in the second innings. Crawford contributed little more with bat or ball in the lead-up to the Test series; in England, the cricketer <a href="Gilbert%20Jessop">Gilbert Jessop</a> wrote an article suggesting that Crawford had become an "unsound" batsman. He scarcely bowled in the first Test, won by Australia, and both the English and Australian press were critical of his bowling. <a href="Frederick%20Fane">Frederick Fane</a>, the acting-captain of England, seemed to share this view in the second Test, withholding Crawford from the attack for some time. However, Crawford took five for 79 in the first innings helped to restrict Australia on a good batting pitch and took eight wickets in the match as England levelled the series.

Australia won the remaining games to win the series. In the third match, Crawford scored his only half-century of the series, hitting 62 out of England's 363 to help his team build up a first innings lead. However, Australia scored 506 at the second attempt, during which Crawford bowled nearly 46 overs to take three for 113. The series was settled in the fourth Test; Australia recorded a big victory after rain affected the pitch and created difficult batting conditions during England's first innings. On the first day, Crawford took five for 48, his best Test figures, as Australia were bowled out for 214 on a very good pitch. "Wisden" noted Crawford "[mixed] up his pace with remarkable skill". By this stage of the tour, the press looked on him much more favourably, and he received praise for his performances. However, his heavy workload with the ball affected his health; he lost a <a href="Stone%20%28unit%29">stone</a> in weight during the tour, and before the final Test a Melbourne doctor diagnosed that he had "strained the right side of his heart" and advised that he see a specialist. Crawford played in that game, won by Australia, despite his ill health, with several other players unfit, and the tour manager later wrote that he looked poorly throughout and should not have played. Nevertheless, he bowled 54 overs and took eight wickets in the match.

"Wisden" considered Crawford's bowling to be one of the most successful features of the tour and praised his ability to spin the ball, reporting: "It was said of Crawford that even on the most perfect wickets he could at times make the ball break back." He led the English Test bowling averages with 30 wickets at an average of 24.73. His batting was less productive than expected; in five Tests, he scored 162 runs at an average of 18.00, batting usually at number eight. In all first-class matches on the tour, he scored 610 runs at 26.52 and took 66 wickets at 25.19. Crawford's contributions enhanced his growing reputation and critics expected his cricket to go from strength to strength. Australian batsman <a href="Clem%20Hill">Clem Hill</a> commented: "There are grand cricketers in this game, and then there is Jack Crawford." The final game in the series turned out to be Crawford's last Test. In 12 Test matches, he had scored 469 runs at an average of 22.33 and took 39 wickets at 29.48.

As the tour neared its completion, the Australian press reported that Crawford planned to remain in Australia, that he had attracted the attention of several "<a href="High%20society%20%28social%20class%29">society</a>" women, and had become engaged. Even so, he returned to England when the tour ended. In May 1909, he published a book about the tour, "JN Crawford's Trip to "Kangaroo" land".

During the 1908 season, Crawford narrowly failed to complete his third double. He scored 1,371 runs at an average of 37.05 and took 98 wickets at 21.48. His season began with a probable dispute over the Surrey captaincy. <a href="H.%20D.%20G.%20Leveson%20Gower">H. D. G. Leveson Gower</a> had been appointed captain for 1908 but the combination of an injury and his marriage left him unavailable for four matches near the beginning of the season. Crawford also missed the beginning of the season; a newspaper article by <a href="Albert%20Trott">Albert Trott</a>, a former Australian Test all-rounder now playing for Middlesex, suggested that Crawford withdrew from the team because he was not appointed captain in Leveson Gower's absence. Instead <a href="Harry%20Bush%20%28English%20cricketer%29">Harry Bush</a>, who had not played first-class cricket for five years, led the team. Trott was sympathetic to Crawford, stating that the Surrey committee went out of their way "to inflict a most undeserved slight" on Crawford.

In the remainder of the season, Crawford scored 232 against <a href="Somerset%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Somerset</a>, his highest first-class score, as well as centuries against Derbyshire and <a href="Hampshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Hampshire</a>. The increased strength and variety of Surrey's bowling attack restricted his opportunities; he was used less as a strike bowler and bowled fewer overs than in the previous season. Contemporary reports suggested that his performances tailed off as the season progressed, possibly through tiredness from having played too much cricket, and that he became a less accurate bowler through trying too hard to spin the ball. The Surrey captaincy remained unsettled; Crawford led the team on several occasions, including Surrey's final game of the season, when his brother Vivian captained Leicestershire, their opponents.

Crawford, who played as an amateur but was not independently wealthy, received an increased expenses allowance during 1908, but other financial dealings with the committee were less successful: they paid his laundry bills in 1905, but refused to do so afterwards; additionally, they refused his request in 1907 to have part of his expenses paid for matches that he missed, as happened with the wages of professionals. His financial problems were compounded by his inability to find a suitable job, and the Surrey committee threatened that he "ought not to be played on the same terms" unless he "[commenced] to earn his livelihood".

Crawford's performances in the 1909 season were less effective than in previous years. He began well, but was later hampered by an injury which prevented him from bowling. His batting average also fell. Surrey experienced disciplinary problems with several of their professional players during the season. The club president, <a href="Richard%20Webster%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Alverstone">Lord Alverstone</a>, favoured amateurs, arguing that a losing amateur team was preferable to a professional side that won; several professionals were left out in favour of amateurs. Apart from adversely affecting some players' careers, this preference had destabilised the team over several seasons. Crawford disagreed with Alverstone, but nevertheless frequently assumed the leadership in the absence of the regular captain Leveson Gower for much of the season. He captained Surrey to a win over the touring Australian team early in 1909 after a strong performance by the professional bowler <a href="Tom%20Rushby">Tom Rushby</a>. However, his captaincy was strongly criticised in the press, particularly over his management of the bowling. Around this time, Crawford's form declined. With the bat, he was often dismissed attempting aggressive shots, and he lost his effectiveness as a bowler. As a result, he was not chosen for the Gentlemen and missed selection in the Ashes series. The press continued to criticise his captaincy, despite Surrey's good results under his leadership. Burns notes: "For a young man with no experience of prolonged failure on the cricket field, this was almost certainly a traumatic time."

Surrey had other problems at this time. When the team arrived in Chesterfield to play Derbyshire, eight of the professionals were arrested following an incident in the street; the matter was cleared up and the press suggested that the police had been over-eager. The county subsequently defeated Derbyshire by an innings in early July; Rushby and his fellow professionals <a href="Walter%20Lees">Walter Lees</a> and <a href="Razor%20Smith">W. C. Smith</a> were very successful with the ball. Shortly after this, Rushby and Lees were involved in an incident of some kind—the exact details are unknown. Leveson Gower suspended them, making them unavailable for Surrey's second match against the Australians. Crawford was asked to lead the team for that game, but with Rushby and Lees omitted, another bowler missing and himself unable to bowl owing to a shoulder injury, he considered the attack too weak. Consequently, he refused the captaincy, and apologised to the Australians for the selection of what he thought a substandard side. In Crawford's absence, Surrey were led by the professional <a href="Tom%20Hayward">Tom Hayward</a>; the match, affected by rain, was drawn.

The cricket press noticed the absence of Crawford and the professionals from Surrey's team over the following games, and noted that Crawford was now playing club cricket. Meanwhile, Alverstone wrote to Crawford that the Surrey committee fully supported Leveson Gower's decision to omit Rushby and Lees, and told him that Surrey would not select him again unless he apologised to Leveson Gower. Crawford refused, writing to Alverstone: "I do not know who was responsible for the selection of the second eleven sort of team furnished up for such an important match ... There seems to be some impression amongst a few of the Surrey committee that I am some young professional instead of being a young fellow who has had an experience of cricket that has seldom fallen to the lot of anyone, and my request for an alteration of the team should have had some weight". In his "History of Cricket", Benny Green describes the letter as evidence of a "literate and quietly self-confident young man who will not easily be manipulated."

Alverstone replied that he "regretted" Crawford's views; the committee respected Crawford as a "brilliant amateur with great experience", but Crawford had not supported his captain—a prime duty for an amateur. Crawford replied that he had been unaware of the reason for the suspensions of Rushby and Lees—which Alverstone and the committee disputed—and would have supported Leveson Gower, but suggested it was unfair to ask him to captain a weak bowling team and then demand he apologise for preferring not to. He also observed that the players omitted from the team against the Australians had since been restored to the county side, making their exclusion harder to understand in the first place.

At this point Leveson Gower withdrew his invitation for Crawford to appear at the <a href="Scarborough%20Festival">Scarborough Festival</a>; Leveson Gower also prevented Crawford's selection for the MCC winter tour of South Africa. Crawford's father wrote to the Surrey committee in support of his son. By the beginning of August 1909, two weeks after the match against the Australians, the Surrey committee severed their connection with Crawford; Leveson Gower felt that he had shown the "deepest ingratitude". "Wisden" reported: "The committee were much incensed and passed a resolution that Crawford be not again asked to play for the county." Informed of his expulsion by letter, Crawford replied to the committee a final time: "I fail to see why I should practically be branded as a criminal because, as acting captain, I declined the responsibility of skippering a team which did not include three essential players, an independence which I trust will remain in spite of the awful example made of me to every amateur in the United Kingdom."

The Surrey committee initially attempted to keep the dispute private, but Crawford sent copies of the letters to the newspapers, explaining in a letter that he wished to end speculation about his absence from the Surrey team. Burns notes that this "[generated] a strong response from the public, mainly unsympathetic to the young amateur" in the letters pages of many newspapers. Many commentators felt that the argument could have been resolved easily had either side made concessions. Green comments that the committee probably either expected Crawford to back down, or were happy to sacrifice him to establish their authority. Another of the players involved, Rushby, left Surrey at the end of the season to play league cricket, but later returned to the team. Crawford's father made a further attempt to end the dispute between Surrey and his son in 1910, asking the committee to reverse their decision. "Wisden" reported that Alverstone declined on the grounds that it would suggest a lack of confidence in the committee, but that if Crawford "came forward in a sportsmanlike way [Alverstone] would be proud to give his personal support to the step proposed. This of course meant that an apology was expected."

In his "History of Cricket", Green contended that the "Surrey committee must be held accountable for a degree of idiocy rarely met with even in the realms of cricket administration" for the way they dealt with Crawford, "one of the world's most prodigious all-rounders." Hart observes that Crawford was challenging figures high up in the cricket establishment on the Surrey committee; he also suggests that Crawford's actions in his later career, and the complaints made against him by other cricket authorities, reveal a stubbornness in his character and suggest he was not merely a victim of the Surrey committee. "The Times" speculated that factors other than the dispute may have contributed to Surrey's decision. Burns believes that Crawford was feeling pressure from several directions: his inability to secure a job, possible frustration at the controlling influence of his father, a desire to be independent, his poor run of form and criticism of his captaincy. Even though, according to Burns, it was an "unwinnable battle", he suggests simply: "Young Jack was in the mood for a fight."

At the end of the season, Crawford played his last matches in England for 10 years, appearing for an "England XI" against the Australians and for the Gentlemen of the South. He had previously discussed emigrating to Australia with the Australian Test player <a href="Victor%20Trumper">Victor Trumper</a>, who had asked Clem Hill to investigate a potential teaching post at <a href="St%20Peter%27s%20College%2C%20Adelaide">St Peter's College</a>, <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>. Originally, assuming that he would be part of the MCC tour to South Africa, he planned to take up his position in March 1910. When the dispute arose, Crawford sent a telegram to inform the college he would take up the post of "Resident Master" early in 1910, for a salary of £160 per year. Burns suggests that this knowledge that he had the offer of work may have prompted him to take a stand against the Surrey committee. In October 1910 he was offered the position of "Ordinary Master" at the college, and £50 towards his travel expenses if he departed immediately. He left England by boat two days later, seen off by his family. No cricket figures saw his departure, but there was considerable interest from the press.

At St Peter's School, Crawford combined his teaching role with supervision of sports, including acting as coach for the cricket team. On several occasions, he had to request leave from the headmaster to play first-class cricket. After arriving in Australia in December 1909, he was playing <a href="South%20Australian%20Grade%20Cricket%20League">district cricket</a> for East Torrens within a week, and played in South Australia's last three matches in the <a href="Sheffield%20Shield">Sheffield Shield</a> competition; the team went on to win the trophy for the first time since 1893–94. Crawford played a large part in this success. There was some controversy over his eligibility to play; <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team">New South Wales</a> initially protested, but there was a precedent for ignoring the requirement of a three-month qualification period, and the New South Wales Cricket Association (NSWCA) Executive Committee accepted this in the case of Crawford, to the displeasure of the full NSWCA. Over four seasons, Crawford played 22 matches for South Australia, scoring 1,512 runs at an average of 40.86 and taking 120 wickets at 23.86. Green suggests that such a performance would have earned him Test selection if he had been Australian, and "Wisden" noted that his record in Australia was impressive.

In the 1910–11 Australian season, Crawford scored a half-century in every first-class game he played but was less successful with the ball. His success against the touring South Africans, perhaps helped by his experience facing their googly bowlers on previous occasions, brought him close to selection for the Australian Test team that year. The Australian Board of Control eventually decided that, as he had already appeared for England, they could not choose him; instead they picked <a href="Charlie%20Kelleway">Charlie Kelleway</a> as the all-rounder. Crawford resigned from his position as St Peter's in March 1911, suggesting to the press that he might move into farming. He may have considered leaving South Australia, but the Cricket Association appointed him as a clerk at the <a href="Adelaide%20Oval">Adelaide Oval</a>, a position which earned £200 per annum, with additional responsibility for coaching and youth scouting. Meanwhile, in England, after unsuccessful attempts by his father to change the mind of the Surrey committee, including a failed bid to secure his own election to the committee, Crawford sent a written apology to Surrey at some time in 1910. Consequently, the committee passed a motion in March 1911 which ended the ban on Crawford playing for the county.

Press rumours over the following 12 months cast doubt on Crawford's future, suggestions including a return to England for the 1912 season. Instead, he remained with South Australia in the 1911–12 season. Although less successful generally, he played for a non-representative Australian XI against the MCC touring team which contested the Ashes that season and scored 110 in as many minutes against bowlers including <a href="Sydney%20Barnes">Sydney Barnes</a>, at the time regarded as the greatest bowler in the world. The following season, in which South Australia again won the Shield, Crawford took seven for 31 against Western Australia, including a <a href="Hat-trick%23Cricket">hat-trick</a>, and scored 163 in 177 minutes against Victoria before taking eight for 66 in their first innings.

In 1913, Crawford was included in an Australian team which toured North America. The team was organised by <a href="Edgar%20Mayne">Edgar Mayne</a>, a South Australian batsman who tried to secure backing from the Australian Board of Control to make it an official representative team, but the Board refused to do so. In all matches, Crawford scored over 1,000 runs and took over 200 wickets, and he was particularly effective as a bowler in the matches designated first-class. He later stated that this was the best tour he had been on; more press rumours suggested that he would return to England at the conclusion of the tour, but he returned to Australia with the rest of the team.

In December 1913, Crawford wrote to the South Australian Cricket Association (SACA) asking for a six-month leave of absence and a guaranteed renewal of his contract. The SACA described his letter as "arrogant" before eventually granting his request and offering him a three-year contract worth around £300 per year, including coaching fees. In effect, he wanted to double his salary or leave to seek a position in New Zealand. Describing these events, Hart comments: "Crawford's financial dealings with the SACA reveal him both as mercenary and as an awkward 'cuss'. The latter aspect of his personality needs to be taken into account lest he be considered merely an establishment victim in his parting with Surrey". On the field, Crawford was successful in 1913–14. He took 34 wickets, and against New South Wales he hit 91 in 89 minutes before taking 10 wickets; against Victoria he took eleven wickets. This latter match was his last for South Australia. Later in 1914, Crawford toured New Zealand with an Australian team—assembled without the approval of the Australian Board of Control—which contained many leading players, under the captaincy of the former <a href="Canterbury%20cricket%20team">Canterbury</a> batsman <a href="Arthur%20Sims">Arthur Sims</a>. In first-class games on this tour Crawford took 21 wickets and scored a century, but his most notable innings came in a minor match. Against the "XV of South Canterbury", he scored 354 in five-and-a-quarter hours, striking 14 sixes and 45 fours. He and Victor Trumper shared a partnership of 298 in 69 minutes, and <a href="Monty%20Noble">Monty Noble</a> helped him to score 50 runs in 9 minutes as the Australian team scored 922 for nine.

In March 1914, the <a href="Otago%20cricket%20team">Otago Cricket Association</a> (OCA) offered Crawford a three-year contract worth £350 per year, and a share in the management of a sports store, to play for them. Briefly returning to Adelaide after the tour, he resigned from his South Australia contract before moving to <a href="Dunedin">Dunedin</a> in June 1914. The South Australian Cricket Association were widely criticised for failing to retain Crawford; in their defence, the committee publicly stated that Crawford had been offered an increased deal and had promised to turn down any offers made to him in New Zealand, but went back on his word. Later historians—Nigel Hart in his biography of Crawford, and Chris Harte in his "A History of Australian Cricket" (1993)—condemned Crawford as arrogant and mercenary for his behaviour towards South Australia. Harte also suggests that Crawford left Australia with many debts. Burns, however, suggests that Crawford may have wanted to maximise his earnings to support his upcoming marriage, and notes that his South Australian teammates held no grudges and even organised a farewell presentation. Once in his new position, Crawford immediately organised a Colts team which produced several future Otago players. While qualifying to play for Otago, he played club cricket in Dunedin, scoring 559 runs and taking 88 wickets. During the 1914–15 season he appeared in four first-class games for Otago, in which he scored 337 runs and took 30 wickets. He briefly returned to Australia in 1915 to marry Anita Schmidt in Melbourne in April. Schmidt—from Adelaide and described in the <a href="High%20society%20%28social%20class%29">society</a> press as a "beauty"—and Crawford met in 1912 when the former was 18 years old and became well known as a couple at fashionable events in Adelaide. Burns suggests that the wedding took place in Melbourne rather than Adelaide because Crawford may have been avoiding his creditors. Two days after the wedding, the couple returned to New Zealand.

Crawford's wages caused the OCA some financial difficulty and were the cause of extended negotiations in 1915. Part of the settlement involved Crawford receiving a lower salary in return for freedom to offer his services to other clubs on a freelance basis. As a consequence, he represented different teams throughout the season in local cricket. He was also paid to coach at <a href="Otago%20Boys%20High%20School">Otago Boys High School</a>. There were other difficulties; the association complained about the lateness of Crawford's report on the Otago team, and were unhappy that he also coached golf. Crawford in turn told the association that several Otago players were late for practice. After further complaints about Crawford's coaching in 1916, the OCA decided to terminate his contract. Crawford initially offered to continue for less money—£245. The OCA bargained, suggesting a payment of £200, whereupon Crawford insisted that he should be paid £300. The OCA then proposed to terminate his contract immediately for a payment of £150 but he refused. He was eventually paid £200 in June to leave Otago. That November, with the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> into its third year, New Zealand brought in conscription. Crawford was called up in July 1917, and was posted to a training camp near <a href="Wellington">Wellington</a> in late 1917. During this time, he played twice for <a href="Wellington%20Firebirds">Wellington's cricket team</a> in first-class matches during early 1918. When given weekend passes, he visited his wife who was left alone in Dunedin. He travelled to England prior to a posting to the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>, although he arrived too late to join the fighting. He was part of the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Rifle%20Brigade%20%28Earl%20of%20Liverpool%27s%20Own%29">New Zealand Rifle Brigade</a> but it is unclear what his rank was. The Repton School War Register states that he was a <a href="rifleman">rifleman</a> but New Zealand press accounts named him as a <a href="quartermaster%20sergeant">quartermaster sergeant</a>. According to a 1992 article in "<a href="Wisden%20Cricket%20Monthly">Wisden Cricket Monthly</a>" by Jim Sullivan, Crawford was demoted while he was in the army. The reasons are unknown, but Burns speculates that his "independent and obstinate nature" made it difficult for him to accept military discipline. While Crawford was in the army, his wife moved to Adelaide. According to Anita, the marriage became unhappy in 1916 and Crawford left her in November of that year. She claimed that he had not supported her financially from that point. When the war ended, she returned to live in Australia with her parents. Her subsequent career as a dress designer and fashion buyer necessitated a move to London, where Crawford was living, in 1921 but the couple never reconciled. They were divorced, with some publicity in Australia, in 1923; in court, she gave evidence that he had an affair with a "third party". She went on to remarry and to have a successful career as a designer and orchestral conductor.

After the First World War, Crawford returned to live in England, and was <a href="Demobilization">demobilised</a> from the New Zealand Army in April 1919. Looking for work, he wrote to Surrey offering to play for them if they found him some employment in turn, but the committee, while writing that they would be pleased if he played for the county again, could not "see [their] way to find him employment". Crawford may have been contemplating playing professional cricket—unheard of for a former Public School cricketer—but instead found work at Repton, his old school. It is unclear what his position at Repton was at this time; he seems to have had no official cricketing role and it is possible he worked as a teacher simply to maintain his amateur status. In any case, Crawford only remained at Repton until the end of the academic year; his short stay may have been the result of poor results by the cricket team. However, Burns suggests: "Another indication that the school was not entirely happy to be associated with the Surrey rebel, whose baggage also included an indifferent war record, was that when the Old Boys cricket team, the Repton Pilgrims, was formed in 1921, Crawford was alone among the school's former distinguished players not to be made a member. He was not invited to join the club until 1952."

Having settled his disagreement with Surrey, Crawford resumed his English first-class cricket career in 1919. After appearing for the Gentlemen against the Players, Crawford returned to play for Surrey against the <a href="Australian%20Imperial%20Forces%20cricket%20team">Australian Imperial Forces</a>. He scored 144 not out, which was later described by "Wisden" as the innings of his life. Surrey were 26 for five in reply to the tourists' innings of 436 when Crawford came in to bat. <a href="Neville%20Cardus">Neville Cardus</a> reported: "[Crawford] fell upon the advancing Australian attack, and by driving seldom equalled, threw it back." He more than doubled his score after the ninth wicket had fallen, hitting 73 out of the last 80 runs scored in 35 minutes to take Surrey past the target required to avoid the <a href="follow-on">follow-on</a>. Among his other successes, he scored 92 against Yorkshire. Playing against Kent, he hit 48 not out as <a href="Jack%20Hobbs">Jack Hobbs</a> and he scored 96 in 32 minutes; this partnership took Surrey to victory as they chased an apparently impossible chase in the short time remaining in the match.

In total, Crawford played in eight games in 1919, scoring 488 runs and taking 20 wickets. "Wisden" commented that his batting was as good as it had ever been, but his bowling lacked spin and accuracy. He played only four more times in first-class cricket. Part of the explanation was that he joined <a href="Dunlop%20Rubber">Dunlop Rubber</a> as a manager at one of its mills in <a href="Rochdale">Rochdale</a>. He played as an amateur for <a href="Rochdale%20Cricket%20Club">Rochdale Cricket Club</a> in 1920, but by 1921 he had left the club—the "Manchester Guardian" speculated that he had returned to Surrey. He returned to live with his family in Merton Park, and played for the local cricket club. Of his first-class matches, one was for Surrey against the Australian touring team of 1921 and the others were for teams representing the Gentlemen. In his entire first-class career, Crawford scored 9,488 runs at an average of 32.60 and took 815 wickets at 20.66.

From the mid-1920s until his retirement in 1952, Crawford worked for the importers <a href="Fyffes">Elders and Fyffes</a>. He played cricket and hockey for the firm until the Second World War, but kept a far lower profile than in his earlier cricketing life. He married his second wife, Hilda May Beman, in December 1925, but he never had children. He maintained a loose connection with cricket; he appeared at a birthday dinner for <a href="Pelham%20Warner">Pelham Warner</a>, at a centenary celebration for the <a href="Free%20Foresters%20Cricket%20Club">Free Foresters Cricket Club</a> and in a radio broadcast for Jack Hobbs's 80th birthday. Crawford had a stroke in early 1962 and remained ill for the rest of the year; he died, aged 76, in a Surrey hospital on 2 May 1963.

Crawford's obituary in "The Times" described him as one of the best young players to play cricket in England and said: "Although he invariably played in glasses, he was a most attractive player to watch, an aggressive hitter of the ball and a dangerous medium-paced bowler". "Wisden" described him as a "hard-hitting batsman", and said he played mainly from the <a href="Glossary%20of%20cricket%20terms%23F">front foot</a>. He had an orthodox batting technique, moved his feet well to get to the ball, and played very straight. <a href="Herbie%20Collins">Herbie Collins</a>, who played with Crawford in Australia, described one of his innings as "a hurricane innings, full of classical shots charged with dynamite."

As a bowler, Crawford's technique was also orthodox, although he was unusual in using his second and third fingers to spin the ball—most bowlers used their first and second. His bowling pace varied from fast to medium, and he spun the ball so much that his fingers snapped audibly as he released it. An accurate bowler, it was difficult for batsmen to score runs against him. Crawford could <a href="Outswinger">swing the ball away from the bat</a>, but his most effective delivery was his <a href="off%20break">off break</a>: Clem Hill stated that Crawford could make the ball turn several inches, despite the hard pitches prevalent in Australia when he played there. <a href="John%20Arlott">John Arlott</a> described him as "the schoolboy genius who turned on Australian pitches where no one else deviated from straight". In 1937, Herbie Collins wrote, at a time when <a href="Wally%20Hammond">Wally Hammond</a> was considered to be the world's leading all-rounder, that "people who have seen both men consider [Crawford] a better all-rounder".

Commenting on the interruption of Crawford's career by his dispute with Surrey, Neville Cardus wrote: "His break with Surrey must be regarded as a sad deprivation of fame and pleasure to himself, and a grievous loss to the annals of English cricket. It is as certain as anything in a man's life can be confidently postulated, that had he continued to play in English county cricket ... he would have taken his place amongst the select company of England's captains." "The Times" commented: "It was one of the great disappointments of English cricket in the first quarter of this century that his outstanding promise was never fully realized." Hart observes that Crawford's on-field successes were many up to 1909 but after that, his career effectively stalled during his absence from English cricket. Hart notes Crawford's "capacity to get on the scoreboard and up establishment noses. He could turn games around and agreements over, antagonise the powerful, endear himself to the young and those young enough at heart to care to characterise great personal performances as 'heroic'". He concludes that Crawford spent the last 40 years of his life "in comparative sporting obscurity". No-one on the Surrey committee ever expressed regret at what had happened, and Leveson Gower did not mention the affair in his autobiography.

Olympic marmot

The Olympic marmot ("Marmota olympus") is a <a href="rodent">rodent</a> in the <a href="squirrel">squirrel</a> family, Sciuridae; it occurs only in the U.S. state of <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a>, on the middle elevations of the <a href="Olympic%20Peninsula">Olympic Peninsula</a>. The closest relatives of this <a href="species">species</a> are the <a href="hoary%20marmot">hoary marmot</a> and the <a href="Vancouver%20Island%20marmot">Vancouver Island marmot</a>. In 2009, it was declared the official <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20state%20mammals">endemic mammal</a> of Washington.

This marmot is about the size of a <a href="domestic%20cat">domestic cat</a>, typically weighing about in summer. The species shows the greatest <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> found in marmots, with adult males weighing on average 23% more than females. It can be identified by a wide head, small eyes and ears, stubby legs, and a long, bushy tail. Its sharp, rounded claws aid in digging <a href="burrow">burrow</a>s. The <a href="coat%20%28animal%29">coat</a> color changes with the season and with age, but an adult marmot's coat is brown all over with small whiter areas for most of the year.

The species has a diet consisting mainly of a variety of <a href="herbivore">meadow flora</a>, including dry grasses, which it also uses as bedding in burrows. It is <a href="predation">preyed on</a> by various terrestrial <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s and avian <a href="raptor%20%28bird%29">raptors</a>, but its main predator today is the <a href="coyote">coyote</a>. The Olympic marmot is rated a species of the <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>. It is protected by law in the <a href="Olympic%20National%20Park">Olympic National Park</a>, which contains most of its habitat.

The burrows of this marmot are made in <a href="colony%20%28biology%29">colonies</a>, which are found in various mountain locations and differ in size. A colony may contain as few as one marmot family or multiple families with up to 40 marmots. Olympic marmots are very sociable animals which often engage in play fighting and vocalize four different whistles to communicate. During <a href="hibernation">hibernation</a> beginning in September, they are in a deep sleep and do not eat, causing them to lose half their body mass. Adults emerge in May and their young in June. Female marmots reach sexual maturity at three years of age, and produce <a href="litter%20%28animal%29">litters</a> of 1–6 every other mating season.

American <a href="zoology">zoologist</a> and <a href="ethnography">ethnographer</a> <a href="Clinton%20Hart%20Merriam">Clinton Hart Merriam</a> first <a href="species%20description">formally described</a> the Olympic marmot in 1898, as "Arctomys olympus", from a specimen he and <a href="Vernon%20Orlando%20Bailey">Vernon Orlando Bailey</a> collected on the <a href="Sol%20Duc%20River">Sol Duc River</a>. The genus, "Arctomys", is from the Greek for "bear-mouse". The species name, "olympus" (Olympic in <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a>), was given because this species is native to the <a href="Olympic%20Peninsula">Olympic Peninsula</a>. The species now is <a href="biological%20classification">classified</a> with all other <a href="marmot">marmot</a>s in the <a href="genus">genus</a> "Marmota". Zoologist R. L. Rausch classified the Olympic marmot as the <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> "olympus" of "Marmota marmota" (he included all North American marmots in this species, which now only includes the Eurasian <a href="Alpine%20marmot">Alpine marmot</a>) in 1953, but it has usually been treated as a distinct species, a classification supported by <a href="Linnaean%20taxonomy">taxonomic</a> reviews starting with that of zoologist Robert S. Hoffmann and colleagues in 1979.

Within "Marmota", the Olympic marmot is grouped with species such as the <a href="hoary%20marmot">hoary marmot</a> ("M. caligata") in the <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a> "Petromarmota". Among this grouping, <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> analyses suggest that the Olympic marmot could be the most <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> species. The Olympic marmot is thought to have originated during the <a href="last%20glacial%20period">last glacial period</a> as an isolated relict population of the hoary marmot in the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> ice-free <a href="Last%20Glacial%20Maximum%20refugia">refugia</a>. The Olympic marmot deviates from the typical "Petromarmota" marmots in the shape and large size of its <a href="mandible">mandible</a> (jawbone), in differences of the <a href="dorsum%20%28anatomy%29">dorsal</a> (back) region, and having 40 <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s instead of 42, all of which are characteristics that resemble the subgenus "Marmota". Some of the differences of the Olympic marmot's jawbone from the typical "Petramarmota" are also evident in the <a href="Vancouver%20Island%20marmot">Vancouver Island marmot</a> ("M. vancouverensis"), which evolved separately, but also occurs in a restricted range with a small population.

The Olympic marmot's head is wide with small eyes and ears; the body is stocky with stubby legs and sharp, rounded claws that facilitate digging; the tail is bushy and ranges from long. The Olympic marmot is about the size of a <a href="domestic%20cat">domestic cat</a>; adults weigh from and are from in length, with the average being . It is the largest marmot, about 7% longer than the hoary and Vancouver Island marmots. This species has the most pronounced <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> found in marmots, with adult males weighing on average and adult females weighing .

The coat is double-layered, consisting of soft thick underfur, for warmth, and coarser outer hairs. Infant marmots' fur is dark gray in color; this changes in the yearling period to grayish brown with lighter patches. The adult coat is brown on the body with some smaller white or pale brown patches for most of the year, becoming darker overall as the year progresses. The first <a href="moulting">molt</a> of the year occurs in June, commencing with two black patches of fur forming on the back of the shoulders. This black coloration then spreads to the rest of the body, and by the fall the coat is almost black. A second molt is thought to occur during <a href="hibernation">hibernation</a>, and upon emergence from hibernation in the spring Olympic marmots may be tan or yellowish. The Olympic marmot's <a href="snout">muzzle</a> is almost always white, with a white band in front of the eyes.

This species can be readily distinguished from the hoary marmot, with which it shares almost every other physical trait, by the lack of contrasting black feet and a black spot on the head. The Vancouver Island marmot has a similar coat color, chocolate brown with white patches.

Olympic marmots are native to the <a href="Olympic%20Mountains">Olympic Mountains</a> in the Olympic Peninsula of <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington state</a>. About 90% of Olympic marmots' total habitat is located in <a href="Olympic%20National%20Park">Olympic National Park</a>, where they are often sighted, especially on <a href="Hurricane%20Ridge">Hurricane Ridge</a>. Marmots are in decline in some areas of the park due to the <a href="temporal%20encroachment">encroachment</a> of trees into meadows as well as predation by coyotes, and they are seldom seen in the wetter southwestern part.

Within the park, Olympic marmots inhabit lush sub-alpine and alpine meadows, fields, and montane <a href="scree">scree</a> slopes. They live in colonies spread out in various locations in the mountains and containing the burrows of differing numbers of marmot families. Some meadows can contain as few animals as one marmot family, and some can have multiple families adding up to 40 marmots in total. There is a higher risk of <a href="inbreeding">inbreeding</a> and death from random events in meadows with fewer marmots, making <a href="animal%20migration">migration</a> essential to the survival of the species. Burrows can be found at various elevations, ranging from to ; they are most often found in the range of to . Burrows are more frequently located on south-facing slopes, which generally receive more <a href="precipitation%20%28meteorology%29">precipitation</a>, per year (mostly snow), and thus have more available flora. The home range of a family of marmots usually covers from half an <a href="acre">acre</a> to five acres (0.2–2 <a href="hectare">hectare</a>s). The Olympic marmot is well-adapted to its generally cold natural habitat, where there is snowfall almost every month of the year on the mountain slopes and barren <a href="grassland">grassland</a>s.

Olympic marmots eat meadow flora such as <a href="Erythronium%20montanum">avalanche</a> and <a href="Erythronium%20grandiflorum">glacier</a> lilies, <a href="Ericaceae">heather</a> blossoms, <a href="Lupinus%20arcticus">subalpine lupine</a>, <a href="Bistorta%20bistortoides">mountain buckwheat</a>, <a href="Campanula%20rotundifolia">harebells</a>, <a href="Cyperaceae">sedges</a>, and <a href="moss">moss</a>es. They prefer green, tender, flowering plants over other sources of food, but roots are a large part of their diets in the early spring when other plants have not yet appeared. During May and June, they may resort to gnawing on trees for food. They also occasionally eat <a href="frugivore">fruits</a> and <a href="insectivore">insects</a>. Their water requirements are met from the juice in the vegetation they eat and <a href="dew">dew</a> on the plants' surfaces.

When snowfall covers vegetation, marmots have a more <a href="carnivore">carnivorous</a> diet, consuming <a href="carrion">carrion</a> encountered while digging for roots and possibly killing late hibernating <a href="chipmunk">chipmunk</a>s. At this time, they also obtain water from melted snow. Hibernating Olympic marmots do not keep food in their burrows; instead, they gain fat before hibernating and can double their body weight to survive eight months without eating.

The Olympic marmot's <a href="predation">predators</a> are mostly terrestrial mammals such as <a href="coyote">coyote</a>s, <a href="cougar">cougar</a>s, and <a href="bobcat">bobcat</a>s; however, it is also preyed on by avian raptors such as <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a>s. <a href="American%20black%20bear">Black bears</a> probably rarely prey on marmots, as evidenced by the fact that their presence close to colonies generally does not generate alarm calls unless the bear advances to within of the colony. The coyote is the primary predator and studies have shown that marmots make up approximately 20% of coyotes' diet during the summer months. During a study in the Olympic Mountains, 36 coyote droppings were collected and two of them contained marmot hairs.

In common with all other marmots, Olympic marmots use the trill as an alarm call to alert other marmots to predators. Continuing alarm calls indicate that a predator is close, and thus increase vigilance in the marmots; a single alarm call results in the marmots curiously looking around for the predator. Sightings of land predators, coyotes in particular, receive more alarm calls than aerial predators. <a href="Fisher%20%28animal%29">Fishers</a> are viewed as predators by Olympic marmots, eliciting alarm calls when just passing by a colony. It has also been observed that these trills can be used as a mechanism to trick and frustrate predators. An additional behavior that takes place when a marmot becomes nervous or bothered by a predator is that it retracts its top lip to show its upper <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s. It is almost like a greeting for predators.

It was reported during a study by <a href="David%20P.%20Barash">David P. Barash</a> that when hunting Olympic marmots as prey, coyotes and cougars approach the marmot within about , advance to an alpine <a href="fir">fir</a> close to the victim, and then chase the marmot downhill to its colony. If the marmot is able to flee into a burrow and sound an alarm call, other marmots will scurry to their burrows for safety. But the predator does not stop here; it is usually persistent and will scratch outside the entrance to try to dig out its prey. Minutes later, when a marmot from a nearby burrow peers out to see if the predator has gone, it will sometimes sound another alarm call, which summons the predator to its burrow. It dives back underground and the predator usually remains frustrated as these alarm calls continue and force it to run around from burrow to burrow, getting tired and aggravated, and finally giving up.

As humans in the Olympic National Park do not hunt the marmot, but simply observe them, they do not pose a threat. When researchers intrude on colonies to observe behavior, the families living in burrows there initially vocalize ascending calls, showing surprise, but later adjust to the presence of humans, allowing studies to proceed.

The <a href="parasite">parasite</a>s of the Olympic marmot include the <a href="Cestoda">cestode</a> "<a href="Diandrya%20composita">Diandrya composita</a>", and <a href="flea">flea</a>s of the genus "<a href="Oropsylla">Oropsylla</a>".

Olympic marmots are <a href="Social%20animal">gregarious</a> burrowing animals, living in colonies typically containing multiple burrows. Activity varies with the weather, time of day, and time of year; owing to rainfall and fog cover during June, July, and August, the marmots spend most of the day inside their burrows, and forage for food mostly in the morning and evening. In between these times, Olympic marmots can sometimes be found lying on rocks where they sun themselves for warmth, grooming each other, playing, chirping, and feeding together. Burrows are multi-purpose structures, used for hibernation, protection from bad weather and predators, and to raise newborn pups.

A typical colony of marmots consists of a male, two to three females, and their young, sometimes living in groups of more than a dozen animals; young marmots stay with their family for at least two years, so a burrow is often home to a newly born litter and a litter of two-year-olds. Marmots seldom move to other colonies with the exception of sub-adults of two to three years old, which may leave the home colony to start a new family elsewhere; females move only a few hundred meters, though males often move several kilometers away from their birth burrow.

A colony may have a subordinate or "satellite" male, smaller and younger than the colony male, who may take over as the dominant male if the incumbent dies. The satellite male lives in a separate burrow, away from the rest of the colony. After emergence from hibernation, if the satellite male and the colony male are both still living in the same colony, the dominant colony male may chase the satellite around multiple times per day. The satellite male's feeding area is limited to areas far from the rest of the marmots in the colony, and he must stay away from the other marmots' burrows as long as the colony male is near. While the satellite male does not approach the other marmots in the colony, they sometimes make trips over to the satellite male's burrow, often about two times an hour. After more time has passed since hibernation, males will become less hostile towards each other, and less avoidance and chasing will occur. Male-male competition ends around the same time that the reproductive season does. The diminution of hostile behavior is only temporary, as the satellite male becomes assigned to its subordinate status again the following spring after emergence from hibernation and the ritual begins again.

When greeting each other, these very sociable animals will usually touch noses or nose to cheek; in <a href="courtship%20display">courtship rituals</a> they may inter-lock teeth and nibble each other's ears and necks. They may also engage in play fighting, in which two marmots on their hind legs push each other with their paws; this play fighting is more aggressive between older marmots. In fights that have been observed during a study, only about 10% of fights had distinct outcomes.

When communicating vocally, they have four different types of whistles, differing in this from their close relatives, the hoary marmot and the Vancouver Island marmot. The Olympic marmot's whistles include flat calls, ascending calls, descending calls, and trills; all of these are in a small frequency range of about 2,700 Hz. Flat, ascending, and descending calls are most often voiced singly. The ascending call has a duration of about half a second, starting with a "yell" on one note and ending with a "chip" on a higher note; it is often used as a distress or warning call for unfamiliar smells and noises. These same "yips" are heard when Olympic marmots are play fighting, along with low growls and chattering of teeth. The descending call ends on a lower note than the one on which it started. The trill, which sounds like multiple ascending calls put together as one longer sound, consists of multiple ranging notes and is voiced as an alarm call to communicate to other marmots in the area that danger may be approaching and they should return to their burrows. Females with young have the responsibility to watch out for their young and other relatives near the burrow, and therefore voice the trill more often than other Olympic marmots. If marmots are not accustomed to human contact in a certain area, they may also sound a trill when seeing a person, in order to alert other marmots. At places like Hurricane Ridge, where seeing humans is a frequent occurrence, most marmots will not acknowledge human presence at all.

They also communicate through the sense of smell. A gland located in their cheek exudes chemicals which they rub on scenting points, such as <a href="shrub">shrub</a>s and rocks, which can be smelled by other marmots in the area.

Olympic marmots start to enter hibernation in early September. Before hibernating, the marmots bring dry grasses into the burrow for bedding or food. Sometimes in early September marmots will stay in their burrows for a few consecutive days, with only brief outings that allow for a little foraging. During this period, they do not play fight or socialize with other marmots; they limit themselves to peeking out and casually sitting outside their burrows. Nonparous females (those who have not given birth yet) and adult males become inactive first, because they do not need to store as much fat beforehand. The parous females, yearlings, and young of the year become inactive a few weeks later, because they have to gain more weight. The marmots of a colony hibernate in a single burrow space, which they keep closed with dirt. Adults emerge in May, and the young in June. Marmots do not eat during hibernation, so they have to store fat before becoming inactive.

These marmots are "deep hibernators"; they cannot easily be awoken. Their body temperature drops to below and heart rate can slow to three beats per minute. Marmots warm their bodies about every ten days. Olympic marmots lose 50% of their body mass over the seven to eight months of winter hibernation. Hibernation is the most dangerous time for them as, in years of light snowfall, as many as 50% of the young born that year will die from the cold because of the lack of insulation that is provided by good snow cover. When they emerge in early May, thick snow cover is still present from the preceding winter, so they are not very active at this time. Sometimes they are so disoriented after awaking from hibernation that they have to relearn the colony's landmarks (which are now covered in snow, which obscures them even more); they wander around aimlessly until they find their burrows.

This species, along with the hoary marmot, has the lowest reproductive rate of any <a href="rodent">rodent</a>. A female Olympic marmot has a litter of from one to six young (3.3 on average) in alternate years. In a given year, a third of females will have a litter. Half of the pups die before the following spring. Those pups that survive the following spring can live into their teens. Both males and females mature sexually at three years, but females generally do not reproduce until they are four and a half years old. The marmot comes out from hibernation at the beginning of May, and <a href="estrus">estrus</a> (heat) occurs about two weeks later. After hibernation ends, both male and female Olympic marmots attempt to entice the opposite sex with courtship rituals. Females who have never produced a litter before tend to be more aggressive and will chase or instigate fights with males; females which have already produced young tend to greet the male with nasal to nasal or nasal to genital contact, with <a href="copulation%20%28zoology%29">copulation</a> following shortly afterwards. This approach is more successful than the aggressive manner of the non-parous female, with mating taking place within 11 to 20 days after hibernation. The relationship between a sexually mature male and female Olympic marmot is <a href="polygyny">polygynous</a>; males tend to breed with three or four females in each mating season.

Approximately four weeks after mating, the female gives birth to her young in a grass-lined burrow underground. Newborn pups cannot see, have no fur, and are pink in color. At first, the young exhibit no sexual dimorphism. It is about a month before the young Olympic marmots first leave the burrow; around the same time, they begin to be <a href="weaning">weaned</a>. Even after they are allowed to emerge, the young initially stay within the immediate vicinity of the burrow, where they can be found chasing each other and wrestling playfully. Within a few weeks after first emerging from the burrow, the young are fully weaned and can feed themselves. Olympic marmots are not completely independent from their mothers until they reach two years of age. Breeding-age female marmots are extremely important to marmot populations. If a female of breeding age dies it can take years to replace her; marmots are usually limited to six pups in a litter, the maturation period is long, and many marmots die before reaching maturity.

The Olympic marmot is the second-rarest North American marmot, behind the <a href="critically%20endangered">critically endangered</a> Vancouver Island marmot. Marmots were first sighted in the Olympic Peninsula in the 1880s. In the 1960s, David P. Barash conducted a three-year study of Olympic marmots after which he reported that there was an abundance of marmots in the mountains. In 1989, the total Olympic marmot population was calculated to be only about 2,000, but this low number was due to poor data collection. Other than this population census, little further research was done on the Olympic marmot until the late 1990s, when concerns arose about population status.

Rangers and frequent visitors to the Olympic National Park had noticed that some populations of Olympic marmots had disappeared from their usual habitats. In response to this, the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a> began a population study in 2002, in which the marmot population continued to decline by about 10% a year until 2006. Predation by coyotes that had not been present in the area before the 20th century was found to be the main cause of death of females, inhibiting population re-growth. By 2006, numbers had dropped to 1,000 individuals; this figure increased to around 4,000 from 2007 to 2010, when colonies stabilized and survival rates rose. In 2010, volunteers started to collect and store data about marmot populations in the park through a monitoring program. The Olympic marmot has been considered a species of <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> since first being included in 1996. Its range is small, but 90% of its total habitat is protected due to being in Olympic National Park. The park, which holds multiple other endemic species, has been designated a <a href="UNESCO%20Biosphere%20Reserve">UNESCO Biosphere Reserve</a> and a <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>. State law declares that the Olympic marmot is a protected wildlife species and cannot be hunted.

The species is susceptible to climate change because of their sensitivity to changed habitats. When meadows in Olympic National Park dried out, marmots there died or moved. In the long term, meadows may be superseded by forests. Climate change will alter the timing, composition, and quality of the marmots' food. Olympic marmots can become more vulnerable to predators when daytime temperatures rise too high for foraging, causing them to forage in the cooler evenings when predators are more difficult to notice. In warm winters, there is heavier predation by coyotes. Marmots become more accessible to coyotes as lower banks of snow allow coyotes to move up higher on mountains where marmots dwell, into areas which they could not usually reach during an average cold winter. Climate change could also have positive effects; a warmer climate would result in a longer growing season in which marmots could mature more quickly and thus breed more often.

In 2009, this marmot was designated a <a href="Lists%20of%20United%20States%20state%20insignia">state symbol</a> of Washington: the official "endemic mammal." Governor <a href="Chris%20Gregoire">Chris Gregoire</a>'s signing of Senate Bill 5071 was the result of a two-year effort by the fourth and fifth graders of Wedgwood Elementary School in <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>. The students researched the marmot's habits, and answered legislators' questions to overcome initial bipartisan opposition to another state symbol.

The Menacer is a <a href="light%20gun">light gun</a> <a href="Video%20game%20accessory%23Add-ons/Peripherals">peripheral</a> released by <a href="Sega">Sega</a> in 1992 for its <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Sega Genesis</a> and <a href="Sega%20CD">Sega CD</a> video game consoles. It was created in response to <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>'s <a href="Super%20Scope">Super Scope</a> and as Sega's successor to the <a href="Master%20System%20Light%20Phaser">Master System Light Phaser</a>. The gun is built from three detachable parts (<a href="pistol">pistol</a>, <a href="shoulder%20stock">shoulder stock</a>, <a href="sights">sights</a>), and communicates with the television via an <a href="infrared%20sensor">infrared sensor</a>. The Menacer was announced at the May 1992 <a href="Consumer%20Electronics%20Show">Consumer Electronics Show</a> in Chicago and was released later that year. The gun was bundled with a <a href="pack-in">pack-in</a> six-game cartridge of mostly <a href="shooting%20gallery%20game">shooting gallery game</a>s. Sega also released a Menacer bundle with "".

Sega producer Mac Senour was responsible for the Menacer project and designed the six-game pack. He originally proposed non-shooting <a href="minigames">minigames</a> based on existing Sega licenses like <a href="Joe%20Montana">Joe Montana</a>, <a href="David%20Robinson%20%28basketball%29">David Robinson</a>, and "<a href="ToeJam%20%26amp%3B%20Earl">ToeJam & Earl</a>", but most of the prototypes were abandoned due to high cost in favor of more shooting-type games. Sega did not plan another <a href="First-party%20developer">first-party</a> release for the Menacer apart from the included <a href="multicart">multicart</a>. Compatible games were published through 1995.

The Menacer is remembered as a critical and commercial flop. Critics found the six-game pack subpar and repetitive, and criticized the peripheral's lack of games. The "ToeJam & Earl" spinoff game was held in the highest regard, and reviewers recommended the Menacer-compatible "Terminator 2" game. A <a href="dedicated%20console">direct-to-TV</a> light gun that includes the six-game Menacer pack was released in 2005.

 The gray, white, and red Menacer is a <a href="light%20gun">light gun</a> <a href="Video%20game%20accessory%23Add-ons/Peripherals">peripheral</a> for the <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Sega Genesis</a>. The Menacer is built of three separable parts: a <a href="pistol">pistol</a>, <a href="sight%20%28device%29">twin sights</a>, and <a href="shoulder%20stock">shoulder stock</a>. (In the peripheral's branding, these parts were called the Master Module, Binocular Module, and Stabilizer Module, respectively.) The pistol has a double grip and fires the <a href="infrared%20beam">infrared beam</a> with a trigger on the back grip. There are three buttons on the pistol's front grip: one pauses the game and the other two provide game-specific functions. Unlike the Super Scope, the Menacer has two infrared transmitters. The optional skeletal shoulder stock and binocular twin sights were designed to improve the aim. "Digital Spy" reported that the twin sights never worked as intended, and "Sega Force" wrote that the gun must be recalibrated when adding or removing the sights. Calibration is performed by aiming at a <a href="Bullseye%20%28target%29">bullseye target</a> to adjust the gun's sensitivity. The gun was designed to be reassembled to suit the player.

The light gun's shots are controlled by its aim towards the television. It operates on batteries and works in conjunction with a sensor plugged into the second controller port and placed atop the television display. The sensor counts <a href="Cathode%20ray%20tube">CRT</a> television <a href="scan%20lines">scan lines</a> to detect the player's shots. "Sega Force" noticed that the controller acts erratically when used under <a href="fluorescent%20lighting">fluorescent lighting</a>. Sega recommended of distance from the receiver, though the peripheral works between from the television. "Sega Force" reported that the controller lasts about 18 hours on new batteries, though Will Smith of "<a href="The%20Hawk%20Eye">The Hawk Eye</a>" estimated fewer ("a matter of hours"). The "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a>" wrote that the Menacer lasts 20 hours as opposed to the Super Scope's 50 to 140 hours. The Menacer has no <a href="power%20switch">power switch</a>: it automatically activates when aimed at the television and turns off after 30 seconds without input. The Super Scope fully drains its batteries when left on. Menacer's Accu-Sight option puts <a href="crosshairs">crosshairs</a> on the screen to eliminate the need to aim manually through the sights. The gun does not have a "turbo" mode for continuous fire, unlike the Super Scope.

 The Menacer was produced in response to the Nintendo <a href="Super%20Scope">Super Scope</a> released several months earlier, though Sega intended to support the peripheral as more than a clone. These two peripherals brought arcade light gun game <a href="Port%20%28video%20gaming%29">ports</a> to home consoles. The Menacer is the successor to the <a href="Master%20System%20Light%20Phaser">Master System's Light Phaser</a>.

Mac Senour, a producer at Sega, was responsible for the peripheral and its six-game cartridge as the company's "hardware boy". He designed the six <a href="minigames">minigames</a> based on Sega's previous intellectual property and licenses—such as "<a href="ToeJam%20%26amp%3B%20Earl">ToeJam & Earl</a>"—under the instruction to avoid shooting games. His prototypes included games based on <a href="Joe%20Montana">Joe Montana</a> ("Joe Montana Wide Receiver Training Camp") and <a href="David%20Robinson%20%28basketball%29">David Robinson</a>, but when presented, the company asked for more shooting games and scrapped all license-based games (besides "ToeJam & Earl", whose license was free) due to their added cost. His "reverse "<a href="Blockout">Blockout</a>" game" prototype was the only other title carried to the final cartridge. Senour recalled that upon his cubicle presentation to Sega Japan's president, the executive did not say anything besides "very good" before leaving. Sega did not plan any other <a href="First-party%20developer">first-party</a> releases for the Menacer—Senour recollected that "they laughed when I proposed more."

Sega announced the Menacer alongside the <a href="Sega%20CD">Sega CD</a> at the May 1992 <a href="Consumer%20Electronics%20Show">Consumer Electronics Show</a> in Chicago and the peripheral was released towards the end of that year. By December 1992, the Menacer began shipping with "" as a bundle. <a href="Goodby%2C%20Silverstein%20%26amp%3B%20Partners">Goodby, Silverstein & Partners</a> produced Menacer <a href="television%20advertisements">television advertisements</a> directed by Danny Boyle. "<a href="Playthings%20%28magazine%29">Playthings</a>" reported that Chicago toy retailers promoted Sega electronics including the Menacer over Nintendo's during their 1992 Thanksgiving promotions. Sega's sales exceeded Nintendo's during the 1992 Christmas season, and gained cultural cachet for the Menacer among other peripherals. "Electronic Gaming Monthly" reported in March 1993 that the Menacer would not have a new game for six months. Compatible games were published through 1995.

Mac Senour left Sega in 1993 for <a href="Atari">Atari</a>, where he received an increase in pay and status. He later worked at <a href="Konami">Konami</a> and <a href="Electronic%20Arts">Electronic Arts</a>. In his first days at Atari, Senour was sent to Paris, where he remembered an excess of unsold Menacers in a <a href="Virgin%20Megastore">Virgin Megastore</a> display. His translators told the clerk that Senour was responsible for the Menacer, and when Senour offered to autograph their stock, the clerk replied in slow English that Senour could autograph the items he purchased.

In 2005, <a href="Radica%20Games">Radica</a> created a Menacer-based direct-to-TV <a href="dedicated%20console">dedicated console</a> with the original six-game cartridge built into a light gun controller as part of their Play TV Legends line of Sega Genesis dedicated consoles. "<a href="Retro%20Gamer">Retro Gamer</a>" wrote that Radica's gun is based on the <a href="Sega%20Saturn">Sega Saturn</a> light gun's design and not the Menacer's.

 Games include the <a href="pack-in">pack-in</a> <a href="single-player">single-player</a> Menacer 6-game cartridge, which consists of mostly <a href="shooting%20gallery%20game">shooting gallery game</a>s:

"Digital Spy" mentioned "<a href="Body%20Count%20%28video%20game%29">Body Count</a>", "Terminator 2: The Arcade Game", and "<a href="Mad%20Dog%20McCree">Mad Dog McCree</a>" as Menacer's other notable games. "Terminator 2" was the first external game to work with the Menacer, the only one confirmed as of December 1992. "Terminator" programmers, Probe Software, later began work on another Menacer-compatible game. "Terminator 2" has a two-player mode that uses one Menacer light gun and one controller. "Sega Force" reported that Menacer gameplay registered faster than the Genesis controller. "Mad Dog McCree", a <a href="live%20action">live action</a> <a href="Wild%20West">Wild West</a> <a href="shoot%20%27em%20up">shoot 'em up</a> for the Sega CD, used either a controller or a choice of several light guns: the Menacer, the <a href="Konami%20Justifier">Konami Justifier</a>, or <a href="American%20Laser%20Games">the game developer</a>'s own compatible light gun. In the 1994 "Body Count", the player defends Earth from an alien invasion. "<a href="The%20Irish%20Times">The Irish Times</a>" wrote that the game is "ideally suited for the ... Menacer" and is "to be avoided" otherwise. The Menacer is also compatible with "<a href="Corpse%20Killer">Corpse Killer</a>" and <a href="American%20Laser%20Games">American Laser Games</a>' other titles, such as "<a href="Who%20Shot%20Johnny%20Rock%3F">Who Shot Johnny Rock?</a>" The light gun does not work with Konami's "<a href="Lethal%20Enforcers">Lethal Enforcers</a>" games or "<a href="Snatcher%20%28video%20game%29">Snatcher</a>", which use the Konami Justifier.

Matthew Reynolds of "Digital Spy" wrote that the Menacer was a poorly executed "flop" that is much less likely to be remembered than its Super Scope competitor, even though the latter did not fare much better. Reynolds added that the Menacer was hurt by the poor quality of the pack-in six-game cartridge and a lack of titles in support of the peripheral. Will Smith of "The Hawk Eye" concurred, calling the peripheral "a commercial and critical flop". The Menacer's original reviewers pinned the device's success on the strength of its developer support, and multiple reviewers cited the Menacer's lack of good games as the cause for its decline.

Writing for the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" on the 1992 Consumer Electronics Show, Dennis Lynch saw the Super Scope and Menacer as a continuation of a Nintendo–Sega <a href="arms%20race">arms race</a> and wrote that the peripheral's "<a href="Uzi">Uzi</a> attachment" was "just what every kid needs". "<a href="The%20Atlanta%20Journal-Constitution">The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>" Andy Pargh said the Menacer was "definitely a winner" in comparison to the Super Scope. "Toronto Star" William Burrill wrote that the "Great Zapper War" would be decided by the strength of the light guns' supporting games. Multiple reviewers ultimately recommended that players wait for more games to be released before purchasing the Menacer. William Burrill of the "Toronto Star" said not to bother unless the player "absolutely love[s] target shooter games". "Mean Machines" called the Menacer "an expensive novelty" until it had more games. The "<a href="Herald%20Sun">Herald Sun</a>" wrote in August 1993 that the Menacer looked to be "an expensive, limited-use <a href="fad">fad</a>".

"GamePro" considered the gun "well-designed" and "fairly good-looking", though they wrote that the gun's options buttons were inconvenient and that the Menacer's lengthy recalibrations before play sessions without Accu-Sight were tedious. "Mean Machines" wrote that the gun's shades of gray clashed with the glossy black console. Several reviewers called the binocular scope addition unhelpful. Paul Mellerick of "<a href="Mega%20%28magazine%29">Mega</a>" found the manual sights an eyestrain and the gun "deadly accurate" as long as players used the Accu-Sight mode. Still, as of January 1993, "Mega" felt that the Menacer's future success was doubtless. Jaz of "Mean Machines" had low expectations for the Menacer, which he compared to the shortcomings of previous light guns: high price, short-lived novelty, and dearth of games. Gus of "Mean Machines" wrote that "Sega hasn't learned the lessons" from the Super Scope's "fairly naff" release in the magazine's January 1993 Menacer review, calling the light gun a "samey-looking, samey-playing piece of hardware, with some redundant add-ons" with mediocre <a href="launch%20titles">launch titles</a>. He added that the Menacer was less tiring to use than the Super Scope, praised the Menacer's infrared, and criticized the gun's lack of available software.

Multiple reviewers found the pack-in six-game cartridge games subpar and repetitive. "Mean Machines" Gus wrote that the games were all too simple and easy. Of the pack, reviewers held "Ready, Aim, Tomatoes!" in the highest regard. Ray Barnholt of "<a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a>" wrote that the Menacer's games were "duller" than its competitor Super Scope's already dull games, but "Tomatoes!" gave Sega's cartridge "some pittance of value". "Mega" rated the "ToeJam & Earl" spin-off at 62%, calling it "fun and strange" though "rather repetitive". "Sega Force" thought the game's graphics were the pack's best, and its audio to be of high quality, though the magazine also considered the game repetitive. "GamePro" thought the game's colors were <a href="Colorfulness">oversaturated</a>.

As for the other six-pack titles, "Mega" called "Rockmans Zone" "not a very inspiring game" for its slow pacing and "bland" graphics. Reviewers compared the game to "<a href="Hogan%27s%20Alley%20%28video%20game%29">Hogan's Alley</a>" and "". "Mega" called "Space Station Defender" concept "incredibly daft". "GamePro" criticized "Space Station Defender" "washed-out and ugly" graphics and "obnoxious" audio. The magazine thought poorly of most of the cartridge's audio. "Mega" found "Whack Ball" easy and did not expect players to maintain interest in it for longer than an hour. "<a href="Sega%20Visions">Sega Visions</a>" compared "Whack Ball" to "<a href="Arkanoid">Arkanoid</a>". "Mega" wrote that "Front Line" was programmed poorly with "the appearance of having never met up with a gamestester", calling it "truly awful". "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>" and "GamePro" compared the game to "<a href="Operation%20Wolf">Operation Wolf</a>". "Sega Force" rated "Front Line" lowest within the six-pack, with a score of 22%. The magazine wrote that the bug game, "Pest Control", would make players bored after ten minutes, and "Mega" said the game was not worth loading even once, giving it their lowest rating of the bunch: 12%. "Sega Force" wrote in February that the games were only fun for an hour and that the peripheral's success would depend on its future games, adding, "Without that [developer] support, it will die as surely as all other attempts at light guns have done." The magazine ultimately recommended against purchase until more games were released.

"Sega Force" Paul Wooding considered "Terminator 2" a "must" for Menacer owners, adding that it far surpassed the quality of the six-pack games. The magazine added that the gun registered shots faster than the controller, was more accurate, and worked well from a distance. Neil West of "Mega" wrote the Menacer works well with "Terminator 2" in his review of the game. "The Hawk Eye" Will Smith wrote in 2010 that the six-game pack and "Terminator 2" were the only Menacer games readily accessible. Ken Horowitz of "Sega-16" wrote that none of the Menacer-compatible titles were exceptional, though "Terminator" and "Body Count" were standouts. He added that the Menacer's small library made collecting easier. Edward Fox of <a href="The%20Centre%20for%20Computing%20History">The Centre for Computing History</a> has said that the museum's Menacer is his favorite piece in the collection when used with the <a href="Aura%20Interactor">Aura Interactor</a> <a href="haptic%20suit">haptic suit</a>.

Heathenry (new religious movement)

Heathenry, also termed Heathenism, contemporary Germanic Paganism, or Germanic Neopaganism, is a <a href="modern%20Paganism">modern Pagan</a> religion. Scholars of <a href="religious%20studies">religious studies</a> classify Heathenry as a <a href="new%20religious%20movement">new religious movement</a>. Its practitioners model it on the <a href="Germanic%20paganism">pre-Christian belief systems</a> adhered to by the <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic peoples</a> of <a href="Iron%20Age%20Europe">Iron Age</a> and <a href="Early%20Middle%20Ages">Early Medieval Europe</a>. To reconstruct these past belief systems, Heathenry uses surviving historical, archaeological, and folkloric evidence as a basis, although approaches to this material vary considerably.
Heathenry does not have a unified <a href="theology">theology</a> but is typically <a href="polytheism">polytheistic</a>, centering on a <a href="pantheon%20%28religion%29">pantheon</a> of <a href="list%20of%20Germanic%20deities">deities from pre-Christian Germanic Europe</a>. It adopts <a href="cosmology">cosmological</a> views from these past societies, including an <a href="animism">animistic</a> view of the cosmos in which the natural world is imbued with spirits. The religion's deities and spirits are honored in sacrificial rites known as "<a href="bl%C3%B3t">blót</a>s" in which food and <a href="libation">libation</a>s are offered to them. These are often accompanied by "<a href="symbel">symbel</a>", the act of ceremonially toasting the gods with an alcoholic beverage. Some practitioners also engage in rituals designed to induce an <a href="altered%20state%20of%20consciousness">altered state of consciousness</a> and visions, most notably "<a href="sei%C3%B0r">seiðr</a>" and "<a href="galdr">galdr</a>", with the intent of gaining <a href="revelation">wisdom and advice from the deities</a>. Although many solitary practitioners follow the religion by themselves, members of the Heathen community often assemble in small groups, usually known as <a href="Kindred%20%28Heathenism%29">"kindreds"</a> or "hearths", to perform their rites outdoors or in specially constructed buildings. Heathen ethical systems emphasize honor, personal integrity, and loyalty, while beliefs about an <a href="afterlife">afterlife</a> vary and are rarely emphasized.
A central division within the Heathen movement concerns the issue of <a href="race%20%28human%20categorization%29">race</a>. Some groups adopt a "<a href="universalism">universalist</a>" perspective which holds that the religion is open to all, irrespective of ethnic or racial identity. Others adopt a <a href="racialism">racialist</a> attitude—often termed <a href="V%C3%B6lkisch%20movement">"folkish"</a> within the community—by viewing Heathenry as an ethnic or racial religion with inherent links to a <a href="Nordic%20race">Germanic race</a> that should be reserved explicitly for people of Northern European descent or <a href="white%20people">white people</a> in general. Some folkish Heathens further combine the religion with explicitly <a href="racism">racist</a>, <a href="white%20supremacy">white supremacist</a>, and <a href="far%20right">far right-wing</a> perspectives, although these approaches are repudiated by many Heathens. Although the term "Heathenry" is used widely to describe the religion as a whole, many groups prefer different designations, influenced by their regional focus and ideological preferences. Heathens focusing on <a href="Old%20Norse%20religion">Scandinavian sources</a> sometimes use Ásatrú, Vanatrú, or Forn Sed; practitioners focusing on <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20paganism">Anglo-Saxon traditions</a> use Fyrnsidu or Theodism; those emphasising <a href="continental%20Germanic%20mythology">German traditions</a> use Irminism; and those Heathens who espouse folkish and far-right perspectives tend to favor the terms Odinism, Wotanism, Wodenism, or Odalism.
The religion's origins lie in the 19th- and early 20th-century <a href="Romanticism">Romanticist</a> movement which glorified the pre-Christian beliefs of Germanic societies. In this period, organised groups venerating the Germanic gods developed in Germany and Austria; these were part of the <a href="V%C3%B6lkisch%20movement">Völkisch movement</a> and typically exhibited a racialist interpretation of the religion, resulting in the movement largely dissolving following the defeat of <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. In the 1970s, new Heathen groups emerged in Europe and North America, developing into formalized organizations in order to promote their faith. In recent decades, the Heathen movement has been the subject of academic study by scholars active in the field of <a href="Pagan%20studies">Pagan studies</a>. Scholarly estimates put the number of Heathens at no more than 20,000 worldwide, with communities of practitioners active in Europe, the Americas, and <a href="Australasia">Australasia</a>.

Scholars of <a href="religious%20studies">religious studies</a> classify Heathenry as a <a href="new%20religious%20movement">new religious movement</a>, and more specifically as a <a href="Modern%20Paganism%23Eclecticism%20and%20Reconstructionism">reconstructionist</a> form of <a href="modern%20Paganism">modern Paganism</a>. Heathenry has been defined as "a broad contemporary Pagan new religious movement (NRM) that is consciously inspired by the linguistically, culturally, and (in some definitions)
ethnically 'Germanic' societies of Iron Age and early medieval Europe as they existed prior to Christianization", and as a "movement to revive and/or reinterpret for the present day the practices and worldviews of the pre-Christian cultures of northern Europe (or, more particularly, the Germanic speaking cultures)".

Practitioners seek to revive these past belief systems by using surviving historical source materials. Among the historical sources used are <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a> texts from Scandinavia and Iceland such as the "<a href="Prose%20Edda">Prose Edda</a>" and "<a href="Poetic%20Edda">Poetic Edda</a>", <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> texts such as "<a href="Beowulf">Beowulf</a>", and <a href="Middle%20High%20German">Middle High German</a> texts such as the "<a href="Nibelungenlied">Nibelungenlied</a>". Some Heathens also adopt ideas from the <a href="Archaeology%20of%20Northern%20Europe">archaeological evidence</a> of pre-Christian Northern Europe and from recorded <a href="Fairy%20tale">folk tales</a> and <a href="European%20folklore">folklore</a> from later periods in European history. Among many Heathens, this material is referred to as the "Lore" and studying it is an important part of their religion. The textual sources nevertheless remain problematic as a means of "reconstructing" pre-Christian belief systems, because they were written by Christians and only discuss pre-Christian religion in a fragmentary and biased manner. The <a href="anthropology">anthropologist</a> Jenny Blain characterises Heathenry as "a religion constructed from partial material", while the religious studies scholar Michael Strmiska describes its beliefs as being "riddled with uncertainty and historical confusion", thereby characterising it as a <a href="postmodernism">postmodern</a> movement.

The ways in which Heathens use this historical and archaeological material differ; some seek to reconstruct past beliefs and practices as accurately as possible, while others openly experiment with this material and embrace new innovations. Some, for instance, adapt their practices according to "unverified personal gnosis" (UPG) that they have gained through spiritual experiences. Others adopt concepts from the world's surviving <a href="ethnic%20religion">ethnic religion</a>s as well as modern polytheistic faiths such as <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> and <a href="Afro-American%20religion">Afro-American religion</a>s, believing that doing so helps to construct spiritual world-views that are akin to those that existed in Europe prior to <a href="Christianization%23Christianization%20of%20Europe%20%287th-15th%20centuries%29">Christianization</a>. Some practitioners who emphasize an approach that relies exclusively on historical and archaeological sources criticize such attitudes, denigrating those who practice them using the pejorative term "Neo-Heathen".

Some Heathens seek out common elements that were found throughout Germanic Europe during the Iron Age and Early Medieval periods, using those as the basis for their contemporary beliefs and practices. Conversely, others draw inspiration from the beliefs and practices of a specific geographical area and chronological period within Germanic Europe, such as <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20England">Anglo-Saxon England</a> or <a href="Viking%20Age">Viking Age</a> <a href="Settlement%20of%20Iceland">Iceland</a>. Some adherents are deeply knowledgeable as to the specifics of Northern European society in the Iron Age and Early Medieval periods, although most practitioners primarily gain their information about the pre-Christian past from fictional literature and popular accounts of Norse mythology. Some sectors of the Heathen movement have perpetuated misconceptions about the past. Many express a romanticized view of Nordic culture, with the <a href="sociology%20of%20religion">sociologist of religion</a> Jennifer Snook noting that many practitioners "hearken back to a more epic, anachronistic, and pure age of ancestors and heroes".

The anthropologist Murphy Pizza suggests that Heathenry can be understood as an example of what the historian <a href="Eric%20Hobsbawm">Eric Hobsbawm</a> termed an "<a href="invented%20tradition">invented tradition</a>". As the religious studies scholar Fredrik Gregorius states, despite the fact that "no real continuity" exists between Heathenry and the pre-Christian belief systems of Germanic Europe, Heathen practitioners often dislike being considered adherents of a "new religion" and "modern invention" and thus prefer to depict theirs as a "traditional faith". Many practitioners avoid using the scholarly, <a href="wikt%3Aetic%23Adjective">etic</a> term "reconstructionism" to describe their practices, preferring to characterize it as an "indigenous religion" with parallels to the traditional belief systems of the world's <a href="indigenous%20peoples">indigenous peoples</a>. In claiming a sense of indigeneity, some Heathens—particularly in the United States—attempt to frame themselves as the victims of Medieval Christian <a href="colonialism">colonialism</a> and <a href="imperialism">imperialism</a>. Snook, Thad Horrell, and Kirsten Horton argued that in doing so, these Heathens ignore the fact that most of them are <a href="white%20people">white</a>, and thus members of the same ethnic community which has perpetrated and benefitted from colonial and imperial policies against indigenous communities in the Americas and elsewhere. A 2015 survey of the Heathen community found equal numbers of practitioners (36%) regarding their religion as a reconstruction as those who regarded it as a direct continuation of ancient belief systems; only 22% acknowledged it to be modern but historically inspired, although this was the dominant interpretation among practitioners in Nordic countries.

No central religious authority exists to impose a particular terminological designation on all practitioners. Hence, different Heathen groups have used different words to describe both their religion and themselves, with these terms often conveying meaning about their socio-political beliefs as well as the particular Germanic region of pre-Christian Europe from which they draw inspiration.

Academics studying the religion have typically favoured the terms "Heathenry" and "Heathenism" to describe it, for the reason that these words are inclusive of all varieties of the movement. This term is the most commonly used option by <a href="Heathenry%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">practitioners in the United Kingdom</a>, with growing usage in North America and elsewhere. These terms are based on the word "<a href="wikt%3Aheathen">heathen</a>", attested as the <a href="Gothic%20language">Gothic</a> "haithn", which was adopted by Gothic <a href="Arianism">Arian</a> missionaries as the equivalent of both the Greek words "Hellenis" (Hellene, Greek) and "ethnikós" – "of a (foreign) people". The word was used by Early Medieval Christian writers in Germanic Europe to describe non-Christians; by using it, practitioners seek to <a href="reappropriation">reappropriate</a> it from the Christians as a form of self-designation. Many practitioners favor the term "Heathen" over "Pagan" because the former term originated among Germanic languages, whereas "Pagan" has its origins in <a href="Latin">Latin</a>.

Further terms used in some academic contexts are "contemporary Germanic Paganism" and "Germanic Neopaganism", although the latter is an "artificial term" developed by scholars with little use within the Heathen community. Alternately, Blain suggested the use of "North European Paganism" as an overarching scholarly term for the movement, although Strmiska noted that this would also encompass those practitioners inspired by the belief systems of Northeastern Europe's linguistically <a href="Finno-Ugric%20peoples">Finnic</a> and <a href="Slavs">Slavic</a> societies. He favored "Modern Nordic Paganism", although accepted that this term excluded those Heathens who are particularly inspired by the pre-Christian belief systems of non-Nordic Germanic societies, such as the <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxons</a> and the <a href="Goths">Goths</a>.

Another name for the faith is the Icelandic "Ásatrú", which translates as "allegiance to the <a href="%C3%86sir">Æsir</a>"—the Æsir being a sub-set of deities in <a href="Norse%20mythology">Norse mythology</a>. This is more commonly rendered as "Asatru" in North America, with practitioners being known as "Asatruar". This term is favored by practitioners who focus on the Nordic deities of Scandinavia, although is problematic as many self-identified Asatruer worship deities and entities other than the Æsir, such as the <a href="Vanir">Vanir</a>, <a href="valkyrie">valkyrie</a>s, <a href="elf">elves</a>, and <a href="dwarf%20%28mythology%29">dwarfs</a>. Although initially a popular term of designation among practitioners and academics, usage of "Ásatrú" has declined as the religion has aged.

Other practitioners term their religion "Vanatrú", meaning "those who honor the Vanir", or "Dísitrú", meaning "those who honor the goddesses", depending on their particular theological emphasis. A small group of practitioners who venerate the <a href="J%C3%B6tunn">Jötnar</a>, or giants of Norse mythology, refer to their tradition as "Rokkatru". Although restricted especially to Scandinavia, since the mid-2000s a term that has grown in popularity is "Forn Siðr" or "Forn Sed" ("the old way"); this is also a term reappropriated from Christian usage, having previously been used in a derogatory sense to describe pre-Christian religion in the Old Norse "<a href="Heimskringla">Heimskringla</a>". Other terms used within the community to describe their religion are the "Northern Tradition", "Norse Paganism", and "Saxon Paganism", while in the first third of the 20th century, commonly used terms were "German", "Nordic", or "Germanic Faith". Within the United States, groups emphasising a German-orientation have used "Irminism", while those focusing on an Anglo-Saxon approach have used "Fyrnsidu" or "Theodism".

Many racialist-oriented Heathens prefer the terms "Odinism" or "Wotanism" to describe their religion. The England-based racialist group Woden's Folk favored "Wodenism" and "Woden Folk-Religion", while another racialist group, the <a href="Heathen%20Front">Heathen Front</a>, favored the term "Odalism", coined by <a href="Varg%20Vikernes">Varg Vikernes</a>, in reference to the <a href="odal%20%28rune%29">odal rune</a>. There is thus a general view that all those who use "Odinism" adopt an explicitly political, right-wing and racialist interpretation of the religion, while "Asatru" is used by more moderate Heathen groups, but no such clear division of these terms' usage exists in practice. Gregorius noted that "Odinism" was "highly problematic" because it implies that the god <a href="Odin">Odin</a>—who is adopted from Norse mythology—is central to these groups' theology, which is often not the case. Moreover, the term is also used by at least one non-racialist group, the British Odinshof, who utilise it in reference to their particular dedication to Odin.

The historian of religion <a href="Mattias%20Gardell">Mattias Gardell</a> noted that there is "no unanimously accepted theology" within the Heathen movement. Several early Heathens like <a href="Guido%20von%20List">Guido von List</a> found the <a href="polytheism">polytheistic</a> nature of pre-Christian religion embarrassing, and argued that in reality it had been <a href="monotheism">monotheistic</a>. Since the 1970s, such negative attitudes towards polytheism have changed. Today Heathenry is usually characterised as being polytheistic, exhibiting a theological structure which includes a <a href="pantheon%20%28religion%29">pantheon</a> of gods and goddesses, with adherents offering their allegiance and worship to some or all of them. Most practitioners are polytheistic realists, referring to themselves as "hard" or "true polytheists" and believing in the literal existence of the deities as individual entities. Others express a psychological interpretation of the divinities, viewing them for instance as symbols, <a href="Jungian%20archetypes">Jungian archetypes</a> or racial archetypes, with some who adopt this position deeming themselves to be <a href="atheism">atheists</a>.

Heathenry's deities are adopted from the pre-Christian belief systems found in the various societies of Germanic Europe; they include divinities like <a href="T%C3%BDr">Týr</a>, <a href="Odin">Odin</a>, <a href="Thor">Thor</a>, <a href="Frigg">Frigg</a> and <a href="Freyja">Freyja</a> from Scandinavian sources, <a href="Odin">Wōden</a>, <a href="Thor">Thunor</a> and <a href="%C4%92ostre">Ēostre</a> from Anglo-Saxon sources, and figures such as <a href="Nehalennia">Nehalennia</a> from continental sources. Some practitioners adopt the belief, taken from Norse mythology, that there are two sets of deities, the Æsir and the Vanir. Certain practitioners blend the different regions and times together, for instance using a mix of Old English and Old Norse names for the deities, while others keep them separate and only venerate deities from a particular region. Some groups focus their veneration on a particular deity; for instance, the Brotherhood of Wolves, a Czech Heathen group, center their worship on the deity <a href="Fenrir">Fenrir</a>. Similarly, many <a href="Heathenry%20in%20the%20United%20States">practitioners in the U.S.</a> adopt a particular patron deity for themselves, taking an oath of dedication to them known as "fulltruí", and describe themselves as that entity's devotee using terms such as "Thorsman" or "Odinsman".

Heathen deities are not seen as perfect, <a href="omnipotence">omnipotent</a>, or <a href="omnipresence">omnipresent</a>, and are instead viewed as having their own strengths and weaknesses. Many practitioners believe that these deities will one day die, as did, for instance, the god <a href="Baldr">Baldr</a> in Norse mythology. Heathens view their connection with their deities not as being that of a master and servant but rather as an interdependent relationship akin to that of a family. For them, these deities serve as both examples and role models whose behavior is to be imitated. Many practitioners believe that they can communicate with these deities, as well as negotiate, bargain, and argue with them, and hope that through venerating them, practitioners will gain wisdom, understanding, power, or visionary insights. In Heathen ritual practices, the deities are typically represented as "godpoles", wooden shafts with anthropomorphic faces carved into them, although in other instances resin statues of the divinities are sometimes used.

Many practitioners combine their polytheistic world-view with a <a href="pantheism">pantheistic</a> conception of the natural world as being sacred and imbued with a divine energy force permeating all life. Heathenry is <a href="animism">animistic</a>, with practitioners believing in nonhuman spirit persons commonly known as "wights" ("vættir") that inhabit the world, each of whom is believed to have its own personality. Some of these are known as "land spirits" ("<a href="landv%C3%A6ttir">landvættir</a>") and inhabit different aspects of the landscape, living alongside humans, whom they can both help and hinder. Others are deemed to be <a href="household%20deity">household deities</a> and live within the home, where they can be propitiated with offerings of food. Some Heathens interact with these entities and provide offerings to them more often than they do with the gods and goddesses. Wights are often identified with various creatures from <a href="Northwestern%20Europe">Northwestern Europe</a>an folklore such as elves, dwarves, <a href="gnome">gnome</a>s, and <a href="troll">troll</a>s. Some of these entities—such as the <a href="J%C3%B6tunn">Jötunn</a> of Norse mythology—are deemed to be baleful spirits; within the community it is often deemed taboo to provide offerings to them, although some practitioners still do so. Many Heathens also believe in and respect ancestral spirits, with <a href="ancestral%20veneration">ancestral veneration</a> representing an important part of their religious practice. For Heathens, relationships with the ancestors are seen as grounding their own sense of identity and giving them strength from the past.

Heathens commonly adopt a <a href="cosmology">cosmology</a> based on that found in Norse mythology. As part of this framework, humanity's world—known as <a href="Midgard">Midgard</a>—is regarded as just one of nine realms, all of which are part of a cosmological <a href="world%20tree">world tree</a> called <a href="Yggdrasil">Yggdrasil</a>. Different types of being are believed to inhabit these different realms; for instance, humans live on Midgard, while dwarves live on another realm, elves on another, <a href="giant">giant</a>s on another, and the divinities on two further realms. Most practitioners believe that this is a poetic or symbolic description of the cosmos, with the different levels representing higher realms beyond the material plane of existence. The world tree is also interpreted by some in the community as an icon for ecological and social engagement. Some Heathens, such as the psychologist <a href="Brian%20Bates%20%28psychologist%29">Brian Bates</a>, have adopted an approach to this cosmology rooted in <a href="analytical%20psychology">analytical psychology</a>, thereby interpreting the nine worlds and their inhabitants as maps of the human mind.

According to a common Heathen belief based on references in Old Norse sources, three sisters known as the <a href="Norns">Norns</a> sit at the end of the world tree's root. These figures spin "<a href="wyrd">wyrd</a>", which refers to the actions and interrelationships of all beings throughout the cosmos. In the community, these three figures are sometimes termed "Past, Present and Future", "Being, Becoming, and Obligation" or "Initiation, Becoming, Unfolding". It is believed that an individual can navigate through the wyrd, and thus, the Heathen worldview oscillates between concepts of <a href="free%20will">free will</a> and <a href="fatalism">fatalism</a>. Heathens also believe in a personal form of wyrd known as "<a href="wikt%3A%C3%B6rl%C3%B6g">örlög</a>". This is connected to an emphasis on <a href="luck">luck</a>, with Heathens in North America often believing that luck can be earned, passed down through the generations, or lost.

Various Heathen groups adopt the Norse apocalyptic myth of <a href="Ragnar%C3%B6k">Ragnarök</a>; few view it as a literal prophecy of future events. Instead, it is often treated as a symbolic warning of the danger that humanity faces if it acts unwisely in relation to both itself and the natural world. The death of the gods at Ragnarök is often viewed as a reminder of the inevitability of death and the importance of living honorably and with integrity until one dies. Alternately, ethno-nationalist Heathens have interpreted Ragnarök as a prophecy of a <a href="eschatology">coming apocalypse</a> in which the white race will overthrow who these Heathens perceive as their oppressors and establish a future society based on Heathen religion. The political scientist <a href="Jeffrey%20Kaplan%20%28academic%29">Jeffrey Kaplan</a> believed that it was the "strongly <a href="millennialism">millenarian and chialistic</a> overtones" of Ragnarök which helped convert white American racialists to the right wing of the Heathen movement.

Some practitioners do not emphasize belief in an afterlife, instead stressing the importance of behaviour and reputation in this world. In Icelandic Heathenry, there is no singular dogmatic belief about the afterlife. A common Heathen belief is that a human being has multiple souls, which are separate yet linked together. It is common to find a belief in four or five souls, two of which survive bodily death: one of these, the "<a href="hugr">hugr</a>", travels to the realm of the ancestors, while the other, the "fetch", undergoes a process of <a href="reincarnation">reincarnation</a> into a new body. In Heathen belief, there are various realms that the "hugr" can enter, based in part on the worth of the individual's earthly life; these include the hall of <a href="Valhalla">Valhalla</a>, ruled over by Odin, or <a href="Sessr%C3%BAmnir">Sessrúmnir</a>, the hall of Freyja. Beliefs regarding reincarnation vary widely among Heathens, although one common belief is that individuals are reborn within their family or clan.

In Heathenry, moral and ethical views are based on the perceived ethics of Iron Age and Early Medieval Northwestern Europe, in particular the actions of heroic figures who appear in Old Norse <a href="saga">saga</a>s. Evoking a life-affirming ethos, Heathen ethics focus on the ideals of honor, courage, integrity, hospitality, and hard work, and strongly emphasize loyalty to family. It is common for practitioners to be expected to keep their word, particularly sworn oaths. There is thus a strong individualist ethos focused around personal responsibility, and a common motto within the Heathen community is that "We are our deeds". Most Heathens reject the concept of <a href="sin">sin</a> and believe that <a href="guilt%20%28emotion%29">guilt</a> is a destructive rather than useful concept.

Some Heathen communities have formalized such values into an ethical code, the <a href="Nine%20Noble%20Virtues">Nine Noble Virtues</a> (NNV), which is based largely on the "<a href="H%C3%A1vam%C3%A1l">Hávamál</a>" from the "Poetic Edda". This was first developed by the founders of the UK-based Odinic Rite in the 1970s, although it has spread internationally, with 77% of respondents to a 2015 survey of Heathens reporting its use in some form. There are different forms of the NNV, with the number nine having symbolic associations in Norse mythology. Opinion is divided on the NNV; some practitioners deem them too <a href="dogma">dogma</a>tic, while others eschew them for not having authentic roots in historical Germanic culture, negatively viewing them as an attempt to imitate the Judeo-Christian <a href="Ten%20Commandments">Ten Commandments</a>. Their use is particularly unpopular in Nordic countries, and has been observed declining in the United States.

Within the Heathen community of the United States, gender roles are based upon perceived ideals and norms found in Early Medieval Northwestern Europe, in particular as they are presented in Old Norse sources. Among male American Heathens there is a trend toward <a href="hypermasculinity">hypermasculinized</a> behaviour, while a <a href="gender%20role">gendered division</a> of labor—in which men are viewed as providers and women seen as being responsible for home and children—is also widespread among Heathens in the U.S. Due to its focus on traditional attitudes to sex and gender—values perceived as <a href="social%20conservatism">socially conservative</a> in Western nations—it has been argued that American Heathenry's ethical system is far closer to traditional Christian morals than the ethical systems espoused in many other Western Pagan religions such as <a href="Wicca">Wicca</a>. A 2015 survey of the Heathen community nevertheless found that a greater percentage of Heathens were opposed to traditional gender rules than in favor of them, with this being particularly the case in Northern Europe.

The sociologist Jennifer Snook noted that as with all religions, Heathenry is "intimately connected" to politics, with practitioners' political and religious beliefs influencing one another. As a result of the religion's emphasis on honoring the land and its wights, many Heathens take an interest in <a href="ecology">ecological</a> issues, with many considering their faith to be a <a href="nature%20religion">nature religion</a>. Heathen groups have participated in tree planting, raising money to purchase woodland, and campaigning against the construction of a railway between London and the <a href="Channel%20Tunnel">Channel Tunnel</a> in Southeastern England. Many Germanic Neopagans are also concerned with the preservation of heritage sites, and some practitioners have expressed concern regarding archaeological excavation of prehistoric and Early Medieval burials, believing that it is disrespectful to the individuals interred, whom Heathens widely see as their ancestors.
Ethical debates within the community also arise when some practitioners believe that the religious practices of certain co-religionists conflict with the religion's "conservative ideas of proper decorum". For instance, while many Heathens eschew worship of the Norse god <a href="Loki">Loki</a>, deeming him a baleful wight, his <a href="gender%20bender">gender-bending</a> nature has made him attractive to many <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> Heathens. Those who adopt the former perspective have thus criticized Lokeans as effeminate and sexually deviant. Views on <a href="homosexuality">homosexuality</a> and <a href="LGBT%20rights">LGBT rights</a> remain a source of tension within the community. Some right-wing Heathen groups view homosexuality as being incompatible with a family-oriented ethos and thus censure same-sex sexual activity. Other groups legitimize openness toward LGBT practitioners by reference to the gender-bending actions of Thor and Odin in Norse mythology. There are, for instance, homosexual and <a href="transgender">transgender</a> members of <a href="The%20Troth">The Troth</a>, a prominent U.S. Heathen organisation. Many Scandinavian Heathen groups perform <a href="same-sex%20marriage">same-sex marriage</a>s, and a group of self-described "Homo-Heathens" marched in the 2008 <a href="Stockholm%20Pride">Stockholm Pride</a> carrying a statue of the god <a href="Freyr">Freyr</a>.

In Anglophone countries, Heathen groups are typically called "kindreds" or "hearths", or alternately sometimes as "fellowships", "tribes", or "garths". These are small groups, often family units, and usually consist of between five and fifteen members. They are often bound together by oaths of loyalty, with strict screening procedures regulating the admittance of new members. Prospective members may undergo a probationary period before they are fully accepted and welcomed into the group, while other groups remain closed to all new members. Heathen groups are largely independent and autonomous, although they typically network with other Heathen groups, particularly in their region. There are other followers of the religion who are not affiliated with such groups, operating as solitary practitioners, with these individuals often remaining in contact with other practitioners through <a href="social%20media">social media</a>. A 2015 survey found that the majority of Heathens identified as solitary practitioners, with Northern Europe constituting an exception to this; here, the majority of Heathens reported involvement in groups.

<a href="Priest">Priest</a>s are often termed "<a href="Gothi">godhi</a>", while priestesses are "gydhja", adopting Old Norse terms meaning "god-man" and "god-woman" respectively, with the plural term being "gothar". These individuals are rarely seen as intermediaries between practitioners and deities, instead having the role of facilitating and leading group ceremonies and being learned in the lore and traditions of the religion. Many kindreds believe that anyone can take on the position of priest, with members sharing organisational duties and taking turns in leading the rites. In other groups, it is considered necessary for the individual to gain formal credentials from an accredited Heathen organisation in order to be recognised as a priest. In a few groups—particularly those of the early 20th century which operated as <a href="secret%20society">secret societies</a>—the priesthood is modelled on an initiatory system of ascending degrees akin to <a href="Freemasonry">Freemasonry</a>.

Heathen rites often take place in non-public spaces, particularly in a practitioner's home. In other cases, Heathen places of worship have been established on plots of land specifically purchased for the purpose; these can represent either a "hörg", which is a sanctified place within nature like a grove of trees, or a "hof", which is a wooden <a href="temple">temple</a>. The Heathen community has made various attempts to construct hofs in different parts of the world. In 2014 the Ásaheimur Temple was opened in Efri Ás, <a href="Skagafj%C3%B6r%C3%B0ur%20%28municipality%29">Skagafjörður</a>, Iceland, while in 2014 a British Heathen group called the Odinist Fellowship opened a temple in a converted 16th-century chapel in <a href="Newark-on-Trent">Newark</a>, <a href="Nottinghamshire">Nottinghamshire</a>. Heathens have also adopted archaeological sites as places of worship. For instance, British practitioners have assembled for rituals at the <a href="Nine%20Ladies">Nine Ladies</a> <a href="Stone%20circles%20in%20the%20British%20Isles%20and%20Brittany">stone circle</a> in <a href="Derbyshire">Derbyshire</a>, the <a href="Rollright%20Stones">Rollright Stones</a> in <a href="Warwickshire">Warwickshire</a>, and the <a href="White%20Horse%20Stone">White Horse Stone</a> in <a href="Kent">Kent</a>. Swedish Heathens have done the same at <a href="Gamla%20Uppsala">Gamla Uppsala</a>, and Icelandic practitioners have met at <a href="%C3%9Eingvellir">Þingvellir</a>.

Heathen groups assemble for rituals in order to mark <a href="rite%20of%20passage">rites of passage</a>, seasonal observances, oath takings, rites devoted to a specific deity, and for rites of need. These rites also serve as identity practices which mark the adherents out as Heathens. Strmiska noted that in Iceland, Heathen rituals had been deliberately constructed in an attempt to recreate or pay tribute to the ritual practices of pre-Christian Icelanders, although there was also space in which these rituals could reflect innovation, changing in order to suit the tastes and needs of contemporary practitioners. In addition to meeting for ritual practices, many Heathen kindreds also organize study sessions to meet and discuss Medieval texts pertaining to pre-Christian religion; among U.S. Heathens, it is common to refer to theirs as a "religion with homework".

During religious ceremonies, many adherents choose to wear clothing that imitates the styles of dress worn in Iron Age and Early Medieval <a href="Northern%20Europe">Northern Europe</a>, sometimes termed "garb". They also often wear symbols indicating their religious allegiance. The most commonly used sign among Heathens is <a href="Mj%C3%B6lnir">Mjölnir</a>, or Thor's hammer, which is worn as a pendant, featured in Heathen art, and used as a gesture in ritual. It is sometimes used to express a particular affinity with the god Thor, although is also often used as a symbol of Heathenism as a whole, in particular representing the resilience and vitality of the religion. Another commonly used Heathen symbol is the <a href="valknut">valknut</a>, used to represent the god Odin or Woden. Practitioners also commonly decorate their material—and sometimes themselves, in the form of tattoos—with runes, the alphabet used by Early Medieval Germanic languages.

The most important religious rite for Heathens is called "<a href="bl%C3%B3t">blót</a>", which constitutes a ritual in which <a href="sacrifice">offerings are provided</a> to the gods. "Blót" typically takes place outdoors, and usually consists of an offering of <a href="mead">mead</a>, which is contained within a bowl. The gods are invoked and requests expressed for their aid, as the priest uses a sprig or branch of an evergreen tree to sprinkle mead onto both statues of the deities and the assembled participants. This procedure might be scripted or largely improvised. Finally, the bowl of mead is poured onto a fire, or onto the earth, as a final <a href="libation">libation</a> to the gods. Sometimes, a communal meal is held afterward; in some groups this is incorporated as part of the ritual itself. In other instances, the "blót" is simpler and less ritualized; in this case, it can involve a practitioner setting some food aside, sometimes without words, for either gods or wights. Some Heathens perform such rituals on a daily basis, although for others it is a more occasional performance. Aside from honoring deities, communal "blóts" also serve as a form of group bonding.

In Iron Age and Early Medieval Northern Europe, the term "blót" was at times applied to a form of <a href="animal%20sacrifice">animal sacrifice</a> performed to thank the deities and gain their favor. Such sacrifices have generally proved impractical for most modern practitioners or altogether rejected, due in part to the fact that skills in animal slaughter are not widely taught, while the slaughter of animals is regulated by government in Western countries. The Icelandic group <a href="%C3%81satr%C3%BAarf%C3%A9lagi%C3%B0">Ásatrúarfélagið</a> for instance explicitly rejects animal sacrifice.

In 2007 Strmiska noted that a "small but growing" number of Heathen practitioners in the U.S. had begun performing animal sacrifice as a part of "blót". Such Heathens conceive of the slaughtered animal as a gift to the gods, and sometimes also as a "traveller" who is taking a message to the deities. Groups who perform such sacrifices typically follow the procedure outlined in the "Heimskringla": the throat of the sacrificial animal is slashed with a sharp knife, and the blood is collected in a bowl before being sprinkled onto both participants of the rite and statues of the gods. Animals used for this purpose have included poultry as well as larger mammals like sheep and pigs, with the meat then being consumed by those attending the rite. Some practitioners have made alterations to this procedure: Strmiska noted two American Heathens who decided to use a rifle shot to the head to kill the animal swiftly, a decision made after they witnessed a "blót" in which the animal's throat was cut incorrectly and it slowly died in agony; they felt that such practices would have displeased the gods and accordingly brought harm upon those carrying out the sacrifice.

Another common ritual in Heathenry is "sumbel", also spelled "symbel", a ritual drinking ceremony in which the gods are <a href="toast%20%28honor%29">toasted</a>.
"Sumbel" often takes place following a "blót". In the U.S., the "sumbel" commonly involves a <a href="drinking%20horn">drinking horn</a> being filled with mead and passed among the assembled participants, who either drink from it directly, or pour some into their own drinking vessels to consume. During this process, toasts are made, as are verbal tributes to gods, heroes, and ancestors. Then, oaths and "boasts" (promises of future actions) might be made, both of which are considered binding on the speakers due to the sacred context of the "sumbel" ceremony. According to Snook, the sumbel has a strong social role, representing "a game of politicking, of socializing, cementing bonds of peace and friendship and forming new relationships" within the Heathen community. During her ethnographic research, Pizza observed an example of a "sumbel" that took place in <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> in 2006 with the purpose of involving Heathen children; rather than mead, the drinking horn contained <a href="apple%20juice">apple juice</a>, and the toasting accompanied the children taping pictures of apples to a poster of a tree that symbolized the <a href="I%C3%B0unn%23Apples%20and%20fertility">apple tree of Iðunn</a> from Norse mythology.

One religious practice sometimes found in Heathenry is "<a href="sei%C3%B0r">seiðr</a>", which has been described as "a particular shamanic trance ritual complex", although the appropriateness of using "<a href="shamanism">shamanism</a>" to describe "seiðr" is debatable. Contemporary "seiðr" developed during the 1990s out of the wider <a href="Neoshamanism">Neo-Shamanic movement</a>, with some practitioners studying the use of trance-states in other faiths, such as <a href="Umbanda">Umbanda</a>, first. A prominent form is high-seat or oracular "seiðr", which is based on the account of <a href="Gu%C3%B0ri%C3%B0r">Guðriðr</a> in "<a href="Saga%20of%20Erik%20the%20Red">Eiríks saga</a>". Although such practices differ between groups, oracular "seiðr" typically involves a "seiðr"-worker sitting on a high seat while songs and chants are performed to invoke gods and wights. Drumming is then performed to induce an <a href="altered%20state%20of%20consciousness">altered state of consciousness</a> in the practitioner, who goes on a <a href="astral%20projection">meditative journey</a> in which they visualise travelling through the world tree to the realm of <a href="Hel%20%28location%29">Hel</a>. The assembled audience then provide questions for the "seiðr"-worker, with the latter offering replies based on information obtained in their trance-state. Some "seiðr"-practitioners make use of <a href="entheogen">entheogen</a>ic substances as part of this practice, although others explicitly oppose the use of any such mind-altering drugs.

Not all Heathens practice "seiðr"; given its associations with both the ambiguity of sexuality and gender and the gods Odin and Loki in their unreliable trickster forms, many on the Heathen movement's right wing disapprove of it. Although there are heterosexual male practitioners, "seiðr" is largely associated with women and gay men, and a 2015 survey of Heathens found that women were more likely to have engaged in it than men. One member of the Troth, <a href="Stephen%20Flowers">Edred Thorsson</a>, developed forms of "seiðr" which involved <a href="sex%20magic">sex magic</a> utilizing <a href="sado-masochism">sado-masochistic</a> techniques, something which generated controversy in the community. Part of the discomfort that some Heathens feel toward "seiðr" surrounds the lack of any criteria by which the community can determine whether the "seiðr"-worker has genuinely received divine communication, and the fear that it will be used by some practitioners merely to bolster their own prestige.

"<a href="Galdr">Galdr</a>" is another Heathen practice involving chanting or singing. As part of a "galdr" ceremony, <a href="runes">runes</a> or <a href="rune%20poems">rune poems</a> are also sometimes chanted, in order to create a communal mood and allow participants to enter into altered states of consciousness and request communication with deities. Some contemporary "galdr" chants and songs are influenced by <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20paganism">Anglo-Saxon</a> folk magical charms, such as "<a href="%C3%86cerbot">Æcerbot</a>" and the "<a href="Nine%20Herbs%20Charm">Nine Herbs Charm</a>". These poems were originally written in a Christian context, although practitioners believe that they reflect themes present in pre-Christian, shamanistic religion, and thus re-appropriate and "Heathanise" them for contemporary usage.

Some Heathens practice forms of <a href="divination">divination</a> using runes; as part of this, items with runic markings on them might be pulled out of a bag or bundle, and read accordingly. In some cases, different runes are associated with different deities, one of the nine realms, or aspects of life. It is common for Heathens to utilize the <a href="Elder%20Futhark">Common Germanic Futhark</a> as a runic alphabet, although some practitioners instead adopt the <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20runes">Anglo-Saxon Futhorc</a> or the <a href="Younger%20Futhark">Younger Futhark</a>. Some non-Heathens also use runes for divinatory purposes, with books on the subject being common in <a href="New%20Age">New Age</a> bookstores. Some Heathens practice <a href="magic%20%28paranormal%29">magic</a>, although this is not regarded as an intrinsic part of Heathenry because it was not a common feature of pre-Christian rituals in Iron Age and Early Medieval Germanic Europe.

Different Germanic Neopagan groups celebrate different festivals according to their cultural and religious focus. The most widely observed Heathen festivals are <a href="Winter%20Nights">Winter Nights</a>, <a href="Yule">Yule</a>, and <a href="Sigrbl%C3%B3t">Sigrblót</a>, all of which were listed in his "Heimskringla" and are thus of ancient origin. The first of these marks the start of <a href="winter">winter</a> in Northern Europe, while the second marks <a href="winter%20solstice">Midwinter</a>, and the last marks the beginning of <a href="summer">summer</a>. Additional festivals are also marked by Heathen practice throughout the year. These often include days which commemorate individuals who fought against the Christianization of Northern Europe, or who led armies and settlers into new lands. Some Heathen groups hold festivals dedicated to a specific deity.

Some Heathens celebrate the eight festivals found in the <a href="Wheel%20of%20the%20Year">Wheel of the Year</a>, a tradition that they share with Wiccans and other contemporary Pagan groups. Others celebrate only six of these festivals, as represented by a six-spoked Wheel of the Year. The use of such festivals is criticized by other practitioners, who highlight that this system is of modern, mid-20th century origin and does not link with the original religious celebrations of the pre-Christian Germanic world.

Heathen festivals can be held on the same day each year, although they are often celebrated by Heathen communities on the nearest available weekend, so that those practitioners who work during the week can attend. During these ceremonies, Heathens often recite poetry to honor the deities, which typically draw upon or imitate the Early Medieval poems written in Old Norse or Old English. Mead or ale is also typically drunk, with offerings being given to deities, while fires, torches, or candles are often lit. There are also regional meetings of Heathens known as "Things". At these, religious rites are performed, while workshops, stalls, feasts, and competitive games are also present. In the U.S., there are two national gatherings, Althing and Trothmoot.

The question of <a href="race%20%28human%20classification%29">race</a> represents a major source of division among Heathens, particularly in the United States. Within the Heathen community, one viewpoint holds that race is entirely a matter of biological <a href="heredity">heredity</a>, while the opposing position is that race is a <a href="social%20construct">social construct</a> rooted in <a href="culture">cultural</a> heritage. In U.S. Heathen discourse, these viewpoints are described as the "folkish" and the "universalist" positions, respectively. These two factions—which Kaplan termed the "<a href="racialism">racialist</a>" and "nonracialist" camps—often clash, with Kaplan claiming that a "virtual civil war" existed between them within the American Heathen community. The universalist and folkish division has also spread to other countries; in contrast to North America and much of Northern Europe, discussions of race rarely arise among the Icelandic Heathen community as a result of the nation-state's predominantly ethnically homogeneous composition. A 2015 survey revealed a greater number of Heathens subscribed to universalist ideas than folkish ones.

Contrasting with this binary division, Gardell divides Heathenry in the United States into three groups according to their stances on the issue of race: the "anti-racist" group which denounces any association between the religion and racial identity, the "radical racist" faction which sees it as the natural religion of the <a href="Aryan%20race">Aryan race</a> that cannot rightly be followed by members of any other racial group, and the "ethnic" faction which seeks a middle-path by acknowledging the religion's roots in Northern Europe and its connection with those of Northern European heritage. The religious studies scholar Egil Asprem deemed Gardell's threefold typology "indispensable in order to make sense of the diverging positions within the broader discourse" of Heathenry. The religious studies scholar Stefanie von Schnurbein also adopted this tripartite division, although she referred to the groups as the "racial-religious", "a-racist", and "ethnicist" factions respectively. The scholar of religion Ethan Doyle White instead returned to the dual division between the "universalist" and "folkish" groups, arguing that the latter could be subdivided among the "ethnicist" and "racial-religious" factions, both of whom "deem Heathenry to be a religion geared for a particular racial or ethno-cultural group (whether conceptualised as 'Nordic,' 'white,' or 'Aryan')".

Exponents of the universalist, anti-racist approach believe that the deities of Northern Europe can call anyone to their worship, regardless of ethnic background. This group rejects the folkish emphasis on race, believing that even if unintended, it can lead to the adoption of <a href="racism">racist</a> attitudes toward those of non-Northern European ancestry. Universalist practitioners such as <a href="Stephan%20Grundy">Stephan Grundy</a> have emphasized the fact that ancient Northern Europeans were known to marry and have children with members of other ethnic groups, and that in Norse mythology the Æsir also did the same with Vanir, Jötun, and humans, thus using such points to critique the racialist view. Universalists welcome practitioners of Heathenry who are not of Northern European ancestry; for instance, there are <a href="American%20Jews">Jewish</a> and <a href="African%20Americans">African American</a> members of the U.S.-based Troth, while many of its white members are married to spouses from different racial groups. While sometimes retaining the idea of Heathenry as an indigenous religion, proponents of this view have sometimes argued that Heathenry is indigenous to the land of Northern Europe, rather than indigenous to any specific race.

The folkish sector of the movement deems Heathenry to be the indigenous religion of a biologically distinct <a href="Nordic%20race">Nordic race</a>. Some practitioners explain this by asserting that the religion is intrinsically connected to the <a href="collective%20unconscious">collective unconscious</a> of this race, with prominent American Heathen <a href="Stephen%20McNallen">Stephen McNallen</a> developing this into a concept which he termed "metagenetics". McNallen and many others in the "ethnic" faction of Heathenry explicitly deny that they are racist, although Gardell noted that their views would be deemed racist under certain definitions of the word. Gardell considered many "ethnic" Heathens to be <a href="ethnic%20nationalism">ethnic nationalists</a>, and many folkish practitioners express disapproval of <a href="multiculturalism">multiculturalism</a> and the mixture of different races in modern Europe, advocating a position of <a href="white%20separatism">racial separatism</a>. In this group's discourse, there is much talk of "ancestors" and "homelands", although these concepts may be very vaguely defined. Those adopting the "ethnic" folkish position have been criticized by both universalist and ethno-centrist factions, the former deeming "ethnic" Heathenry a front for racism and the latter deeming its adherents <a href="race%20traitor">race traitor</a>s for their failure to fully embrace the ethnic cause.

Some folkish Heathens are white supremacists and explicit racists, representing a "radical racist" faction that favours the terms "Odinism", "Wotanism", and "Wodenism". Kaplan stated that the "borderline separating racialist Odinism and <a href="Neo-Nazism">National Socialism</a> is exceedingly thin", adding that this racialist wing inhabited "the most distant reaches" of the modern Pagan movement. The historian <a href="Nicholas%20Goodrick-Clarke">Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke</a> similarly stated that Odinism "represents the battlefront of racist paganism in support of a white Aryan revolutionary path". Practitioners in this sector of the religion have paid tribute to <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> and <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>, claimed that the white race is <a href="White%20genocide%20conspiracy%20theory">facing extinction</a> at the hands of a <a href="Zionist%20Occupation%20Government%20conspiracy%20theory">Jewish world conspiracy</a>, and rejected Christianity as a creation of the Jews. Several such groups, like the <a href="Asatru%20Folk%20Assembly">Asatru Folk Assembly</a> (AFA) and the <a href="Wolves%20of%20Vinland">Wolves of Vinland</a>, are designated as <a href="List%20of%20organizations%20designated%20by%20the%20Southern%20Poverty%20Law%20Center%20as%20hate%20groups">hate groups</a> by the U.S. <a href="Southern%20Poverty%20Law%20Center">Southern Poverty Law Center</a>. Many in the inner circle of <a href="The%20Order%20%28white%20supremacist%20group%29">The Order</a>, a white supremacist militant group active in the U.S. during the 1980s, described themselves as Odinists, and various racist Heathens have espoused the <a href="Fourteen%20Words">Fourteen Words</a> slogan developed by the Wotanist and Order member <a href="David%20Lane%20%28white%20supremacist%29">David Lane</a>. Some racist organisations, such as the <a href="Order%20of%20Nine%20Angles">Order of Nine Angles</a> and the <a href="Black%20Order%20%28Satanist%20group%29">Black Order</a>, combine elements of Heathenism with <a href="Satanism">Satanism</a>, although other racist Heathens, such as <a href="Wotansvolk">Wotansvolk</a>'s Ron McVan, have denounced the integration of these differing religious traditions.

Ethno-centrist Heathens are heavily critical of their universalist counterparts, often declaring that the latter have been misled by New Age literature and <a href="political%20correctness">political correctness</a>. Snook stated that both mainstream media and early academic studies of American Heathenry had focused primarily on the racist elements within the movement, thus neglecting the religion's anti-racist wing. Many anti-racist practitioners have expressed frustration that Heathenry is misrepresented by some journalists and academics as a racist movement, using their online presence to stress their opposition to extreme-right politics.

During the late 18th and 19th centuries, <a href="German%20Romanticism">German Romanticism</a> focused increasing attention on the pre-Christian belief systems of Germanic Europe, with various Romanticist intellectuals expressing the opinion that these ancient religions were "more natural, organic and positive" than Christianity. Such an attitude was promoted by the scholarship of Romanticist intellectuals like <a href="Johann%20Gottfried%20Herder">Johann Gottfried Herder</a>, <a href="Jacob%20Grimm">Jacob Grimm</a>, and <a href="Wilhelm%20Grimm">Wilhelm Grimm</a>. This development went in tandem with a growth in <a href="nationalism">nationalism</a> and the idea of the "<a href="volk">volk</a>", contributing to the establishment of the <a href="V%C3%B6lkisch%20movement">Völkisch movement</a> in German-speaking Europe. Criticising the <a href="Origins%20of%20Christianity">Jewish roots of Christianity</a>, in 1900 the Germanist <a href="Ernst%20Wachler">Ernst Wachler</a> published a pamphlet calling for the revival of a racialized ancient German religion. Other writers such as <a href="Ludwig%20Fahrenkrog">Ludwig Fahrenkrog</a> supported his claims, resulting in the formation of both the Bund fur Persönlichkeitskultur (League for the Culture of the Personality) and the Deutscher Orden in 1911 and then the Germanische-Deutsche Religionsgemeinschaft (Germanic-German Religious Community) in 1912.

Another development of Heathenry emerged within the occult völkisch movement known as <a href="Ariosophy">Ariosophy</a>. One of these völkisch Ariosophists was the Austrian occultist <a href="Guido%20von%20List">Guido von List</a>, who established a religion that he termed "Wotanism", with an inner core that he referred to as "Armanism". List's Wotanism was based heavily on the "Eddas", although over time it came to be increasingly influenced by the occult teachings of the <a href="Theosophical%20Society">Theosophical Society</a>. List's ideas were transmitted in Germany by prominent right-wingers, and adherents to his ideas were among the founders of the <a href="Reichshammerbund">Reichshammerbund</a> in <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a> in 1912, and they included individuals who held key positions in the <a href="Germanenorden">Germanenorden</a>. The <a href="Thule%20Society">Thule Society</a> founded by <a href="Rudolf%20von%20Sebottendorf">Rudolf von Sebottendorf</a> developed from the Germanenorden, and it displayed a Theosophically-influenced interpretation of Norse mythology.

In 1933, the eclectic <a href="German%20Faith%20Movement">German Faith Movement</a> ("Deutsche Glaubensbewegung") was founded by the religious studies scholar <a href="Jakob%20Wilhelm%20Hauer">Jakob Wilhelm Hauer</a>, who wanted to unite these disparate Heathen groups. Although active throughout the Nazi era, his hopes that his "German Faith" would be declared the official <a href="Religious%20aspects%20of%20Nazism">faith of Nazi Germany</a> were thwarted. Although the Heathen movement probably never had more than a few thousand followers during its 1920s heyday, it held the allegiance of many middle-class intellectuals, including journalists, artists, illustrators, scholars, and teachers, and thus exerted a wider influence on German society.

The völkisch occultists—among them Pagans like List and Christians like <a href="J%C3%B6rg%20Lanz%20von%20Liebenfels">Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels</a>—"contributed importantly to the mood of the Nazi era". Few had a direct influence on the Nazi Party leadership, with one prominent exception: <a href="Karl%20Maria%20Wiligut">Karl Maria Wiligut</a> was both a friend and a key influence on the <a href="Schutzstaffel">Schutzstaffel</a> (SS) leader <a href="Heinrich%20Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a>. Wiligut professed ancestral-<a href="clairvoyance">clairvoyant</a> memories of ancient German society, proclaiming that "Wotanism" was in conflict with another ancient religion, "<a href="Irminenschaft">Irminenschaft</a>", which was devoted to a messianic Germanic figure known as Krist, who was later wrongly transformed into the figure of <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a>. Many Heathen groups disbanded during the Nazi period, and they were only able to re-establish themselves after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, in <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a>, where <a href="freedom%20of%20religion">freedom of religion</a> had been re-established. After the defeat of Nazi Germany, there was a social stigma surrounding völkisch ideas and groups, along with a common perception that the mythologies of the pre-Christian Germanic societies had been tainted through their usage by the Nazi administration, an attitude that to some extent persisted into the 21st century.

The völkisch movement also manifested itself in 1930s <a href="Norway">Norway</a> within the milieu surrounding such groups as the Ragnarok Circle and Hans S. Jacobsen's "Tidsskriftet Ragnarok" journal. Prominent figures involved in this milieu were the writer <a href="Per%20Imerslund">Per Imerslund</a> and the composer <a href="Geirr%20Tveitt">Geirr Tveitt</a>, although it left no successors in post-war Norway. A variant of "Odinism" was developed by the Australian <a href="Alexander%20Rud%20Mills">Alexander Rud Mills</a>, who published "The Odinist Religion" (1930) and established the <a href="Anglecyn%20Church%20of%20Odin">Anglecyn Church of Odin</a>. Politically racialist, Mills viewed Odinism as a religion for what he considered to be the "British race", and he deemed it to be in a cosmic battle with the Judeo-Christian religion. Having formulated "his own unique blend" of Ariosophy, Mills was heavily influenced by von List's writings. Some of Heathenry's roots have also been traced back to the <a href="Back-to-the-land%20movement">"back to nature" movement</a> of the early 20th century, among them the <a href="Kibbo%20Kift">Kibbo Kift</a> and the <a href="Order%20of%20Woodcraft%20Chivalry">Order of Woodcraft Chivalry</a>.

In the early 1970s, Heathen organisations emerged in the United Kingdom, the United States, <a href="Heathenry%20in%20Canada">Canada</a>, Australia, and Iceland, largely independently from each other. This has been partly attributed to the wider growth of the modern Pagan movement during the 1960s and 1970s, as well as the development of the New Age milieu, both of which encouraged the establishment of new religious movements intent on reviving pre-Christian belief systems. Further Heathen groups then emerged in the 1990s and 2000s, many of which distanced themselves from overtly political agendas and placed a stronger emphasis on historical authenticity than their 1960s and 1970s forebears.

Heathenry emerged in the United States during the 1960s. In 1969 the Danish Heathen <a href="Else%20Christensen">Else Christensen</a> established the <a href="Odinist%20Fellowship%20%28United%20States%29">Odinist Fellowship</a> at her home in the U.S. state of <a href="Florida">Florida</a>. Heavily influenced by Mills' writings, she began publishing a magazine, "The Odinist", which placed greater emphasis on right-wing and racialist ideas than theological ones. <a href="Stephen%20McNallen">Stephen McNallen</a> first founded the Viking Brotherhood in the early 1970s, before creating the Asatru Free Assembly in 1976, which broke up in 1986 amid widespread political disagreements after McNallen's repudiation of <a href="Neo-Nazism">neo-Nazis</a> within the group. In the 1990s, McNallen founded the Asatru Folk Assembly (AFA), an ethnically-oriented Heathen group headquartered in <a href="California">California</a>. Meanwhile, Valgard Murray and his kindred in <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a> founded the <a href="%C3%81satr%C3%BA%20Alliance">Ásatrú Alliance</a> (AA) in the late 1980s, which shared the AFA's perspectives on race and which published the "Vor Tru" newsletter. In 1987, <a href="Stephen%20Flowers">Stephen Flowers</a> and James Chisholm founded <a href="The%20Troth">The Troth</a>, which was incorporated in <a href="Texas">Texas</a>. Taking an inclusive, non-racialist view, it soon grew into an international organisation.

In Iceland, the influence of pre-Christian belief systems still pervaded the country's cultural heritage into the 20th century. There, farmer <a href="Sveinbj%C3%B6rn%20Beinteinsson">Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson</a> founded the Heathen group Ásatrúarfélagið in 1972, which initially had 12 members. Beinteinsson served as "Allsherjargodi" (chief priest) until his death in 1993, when he was succeeded by <a href="Jormundur%20Ingi%20Hansen">Jormundur Ingi Hansen</a>. As the group expanded in size, Hansen's leadership caused schisms, and to retain the unity of the movement, he stepped down and was replaced by <a href="Hilmar%20%C3%96rn%20Hilmarsson">Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson</a> in 2003, by which time Ásatrúarfélagið had accumulated 777 members and played a visible role in Icelandic society. In England, the British Committee for the Restoration of the <a href="Odinic%20Rite">Odinic Rite</a> was established by John Yeowell in 1972. In 1992, Mark Mirabello published "<a href="Odin%20Brotherhood">Odin Brotherhood</a>", which claimed the existence of a secret society of Odinists; most British Heathens doubt its existence.

In Sweden, the first Heathen groups developed in the 1970s; early examples included the Breidablikk-Gildet (Guild of Breidablikk) founded in 1975 and the Telge Fylking founded in 1987, the latter of which diverged from the former by emphasising a non-racialist interpretation of the religion. In 1994, the Sveriges Asatrosamfund (Swedish Asatru Assembly) was founded, growing to become the largest Heathen organisation in the country. The first Norwegian Heathen group, Blindern Åsatrulag, was established as a student group at the <a href="University%20of%20Oslo">University of Oslo</a> in the mid-1980s, while the larger <a href="%C3%85satrufellesskapet%20Bifrost">Åsatrufellesskapet Bifrost</a> was established in 1996; after a schism in that group, the <a href="Foreningen%20Forn%20Sed">Foreningen Forn Sed</a> was formed in 1999. In Denmark, a small group was founded near to <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> in 1986, although as a wider movement Heathenry would not be established until the 1990s, when a group calling itself Forn Siðr developed.

In Germany, various groups were established that explicitly rejected their religion's völkisch and right-wing past, most notably Rabenclan (Raven's Clan) in 1994 and Nornirs Ætt (Kin of the Norns) in 2005. Several foreign Heathen organisations also established a presence in the German Heathen scene; in 1994 the Odinic Rite Deutschland (Odinic Rite Germany) was founded, although it later declared its independence and became the Verein für germanisches Heidentum VfgH (Society for Germanic Paganism), while the Troth also created a German group, Eldaring, which declared its independence in 2000. The first organised Heathen groups in the Czech Republic emerged in the late 1990s. From 2000 to 2008, a Czech Heathen group that adopted a Pan-Germanic approach to the religion was active under the name of Heathen Hearts from Biohaemum.

Heathen influences were apparent in forms of <a href="black%20metal">black metal</a> from the 1990s, where lyrics and themes often expressed a longing for a pre-Christian Northern past; the mass media typically associated this music genre with Satanism. The <a href="Pagan%20metal">Pagan metal</a> genre—which emerged from the fragmentation of the <a href="extreme%20metal">extreme metal</a> scene in Northern Europe during the early 1990s—came to play an important role in the North European Pagan scene. Many musicians involved in <a href="Viking%20metal">Viking metal</a> were also practicing Heathens, with many metal bands embracing the heroic masculinity embodied in Norse mythological figures like Odin and Thor. Heathen themes also appeared in the <a href="neofolk">neofolk</a> genre. From the mid-1990s, the <a href="Internet">Internet</a> greatly aided the propagation of Heathenry in various parts of the world. That decade also saw the strong growth of racist Heathenry among those incarcerated within the U.S. prison system as a result of outreach programs established by various Heathen groups, a project begun in the 1980s. During this period, many Heathen groups also began to interact increasingly with other ethnic-oriented Pagan groups in <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a>, such as <a href="Lithuania">Lithuania</a>n <a href="Romuva%20%28religion%29">Romuva</a>, and many joined the <a href="European%20Congress%20of%20Ethnic%20Religions">World Congress of Ethnic Religions</a> upon its formation in 1998.

Adherents of Heathenry can be found in Europe, North America, and Australasia, with more recent communities also establishing in Latin America. They are mostly found in those areas with a Germanic cultural inheritance, although they are present in several other regions. In 2007, the religious studies scholar Graham Harvey stated that it was impossible to develop a precise figure for the number of Heathens across the world. A self-selected census in 2013 found 16,700 members in 98 countries, the bulk of whom lived in the United States. In 2016, Schnurbein stated that there were probably no more than 20,000 Heathens globally.

Schnurbein noted that, while there were some exceptions, most Heathen groups were 60–70% male in their composition. On the basis of his sociological research, Joshua Marcus Cragle agreed that the religion contained a greater proportion of men than women, although observed that there was a more even balance between the two in Northern and Western Europe than in other regions. He also found that the Heathen community contained a greater percentage of transgender individuals, at 2%, than is estimated to be present in the wider population. Similarly, Cragle's research found a greater proportion of LGBT practitioners within Heathenry (21%) than wider society, although noted that the percentage was lower than in other forms of modern Paganism. Cragle also found that in every region except Latin America, the majority of Heathens were middle-aged, and that most were of European descent.

Many Heathens cite a childhood interest in German folk tales or Norse myths as having led them to take an interest in Heathenry; others have instead attributed their introduction to depictions of Norse religion in popular culture. Some others claim to have involved themselves in the religion after experiencing direct revelation through dreams, which they interpret as having been provided by the gods. As with other religions, a sensation of "coming home" has also been reported by many Heathens who have converted to the movement, although Calico thought such a narrative was "not characteristic" of most U.S. Heathens. Pizza suggested that, on the basis of her research among the Heathen community in the American Midwest, that many Euro-American practitioners were motivated to join the movement both out of a desire to "find roots" within historical European cultures and to meet "a genuine need for spiritual connections and community".

Cragle's 2015 survey indicated that 45% of Heathens had been raised as Christians, although 21% had previously had no religious affiliation or been atheists or agnostics. Although practitioners typically live within Christian majority societies, they often express the view that Christianity has little to offer them. In referring to Heathens in the U.S., Snook, Thad Horrell, and Kristen Horton noted that practitioners "almost always formulate oppositional identities" to Christianity. Through her research, Schnurbein found that during the 1980s many Heathens in Europe had been motivated to join the religion in part by their own anti-Christian ethos, but that this attitude had become less prominent among the Heathen community as the significance of the Christian churches had declined in Western nations after that point. Conversely, in 2018 Calico noted that a "deep antipathy" to Christianity was still "quite close to the surface for many American Heathens", with anti-Christian sentiment often being expressed through humor in that community. Many Heathens are also involved in <a href="historical%20reenactment">historical reenactment</a>, focusing on the early medieval societies of Germanic Europe, although others are critical of this practice, believing that it blurs the boundary between real life and fantasy. Some adherents also practice Heathenry in tandem with other Pagan religions, such as Wicca or <a href="Neo-Druidism">Druidry</a>, although many others look unfavorably on such religions for being too syncretic.

The United States likely contains the largest Heathen community in the world. Although deeming it impossible to calculate the exact size of the Heathen community in the U.S., in the mid-1990s the sociologist Jeffrey Kaplan estimated that there were around 500 active practitioners in the country, with a further thousand individuals on the periphery of the movement. He noted that the overwhelming majority of individuals in the American Heathen community were white, male, and young. Most had at least an undergraduate degree, and worked in a mix of <a href="white-collar%20worker">white collar</a> and <a href="blue-collar%20worker">blue collar jobs</a>.

The Pagan Census project led by <a href="Helen%20A.%20Berger">Helen A. Berger</a>, Evan A. Leach, and Leigh S. Shaffer gained 60 responses from Heathens in the U.S. Of these respondents, 65% were male and 35% female, which Berger, Leach, and Shaffer noted was the "opposite" of the female majority trend within the rest of the country's Pagan community. The majority had a college education, but were generally less well educated than the wider Pagan community, and also had a lower median income. From her experience within the community, Snook concurred that the majority of American Heathens were male, adding that most were white and middle-aged, but believed that there had been a growth in the proportion of female Heathens in the U.S. since the mid-1990s. Subsequent assessments have suggested a larger support base; 10,000 to 20,000 according to McNallen in 2006, and 7,878 according to the 2014 census. In 2018, the scholar of religion Jefferson F. Calico suggested that it was likely there were between 8000 and 20,000 Heathens in the U.S.

In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Census%202001">United Kingdom Census 2001</a>, 300 people registered as Heathen in <a href="England%20and%20Wales">England and Wales</a>. Many Heathens followed the advice of the <a href="Pagan%20Federation">Pagan Federation</a> (PF) and simply described themselves as "Pagan", while other Heathens did not specify their religious beliefs. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Census%202011">2011 census</a>, 1,958 people self-identified as Heathen in England and Wales.

By 2003, the Icelandic Heathen organisation Ásatrúarfélagið had 777 members, by 2015, it reported 2,400 members, and by January 2017 it claimed 3,583 members, constituting just over 1% of the Icelandic population. In Iceland, Heathenry has an impact larger than the number of its adherents. Based on his experience researching Danish Heathens, Amster stated that while it was possible to obtain membership figures of Heathen organisations, it was "impossible to estimate" the number of unaffiliated solo practitioners. Conversely, in 2015, Gregorius estimated that there were at most a thousand Heathens in Sweden—both affiliated and unaffiliated—although noted that practitioners themselves often perceived their numbers as being several times higher than this. Although noting that there were no clear figures available for the gender balance within the community, he cited practitioners who claim that there are more men active within Swedish Heathen organisations. Schnurbein observed that most Heathens in Scandinavia were middle-class professionals aged between thirty and sixty.

There are a small number of Heathens in Poland, where they have established a presence on social media. The majority of these Polish Heathens belong to the non-racist wing of the movement. There are also a few Heathens in the Slovenian Pagan scene, where they are outnumbered by practitioners of <a href="Slavic%20Native%20Faith">Slavic Native Faith</a>. Exponents of Heathenry are also found on websites in Serbia. In Russia, several far-right groups merge elements from Heathenry with aspects adopted from Slavic Native Faith and <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Russian Orthodox Christianity</a>. There are also several Heathens in the Israeli Pagan scene.

Rolls-Royce R

The Rolls-Royce R was a British <a href="Aircraft%20engine">aero engine</a> designed and built specifically for <a href="air%20racing">air racing</a> purposes by <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Limited">Rolls-Royce Limited</a>. Nineteen R engines were assembled in a limited production run between 1929 and 1931. Developed from the <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Buzzard">Rolls-Royce Buzzard</a>, it was a 37-litre (2,240 cu in) <a href="Engine%20displacement">capacity</a>, <a href="Supercharger">supercharged</a> <a href="V12%20engine">V-12</a> capable of producing just under 2,800 <a href="horsepower">horsepower</a> (2,090 kW), and weighed 1,640 pounds (770 kg). Intensive factory testing revealed mechanical failures which were remedied by redesigning the components, greatly improving reliability.

The R was used with great success in the <a href="Schneider%20Trophy">Schneider Trophy</a> <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a> competitions held in England in 1929 and 1931. Shortly after the 1931 competition, an R engine using a special fuel blend powered the winning <a href="Supermarine%20S.6B">Supermarine S.6B</a> aircraft to a new <a href="Flight%20airspeed%20record">airspeed record</a> of over 400 miles per hour (640 km/h). Continuing through the 1930s, both new and used R engines were used to achieve various <a href="land%20speed%20record">land</a> and <a href="water%20speed%20record">water speed record</a>s by such racing personalities as <a href="Henry%20Segrave">Sir Henry Segrave</a>, <a href="Malcolm%20Campbell">Sir Malcolm Campbell</a> and his son <a href="Donald%20Campbell">Donald</a>, the last record being set in 1939. A final R-powered water speed record attempt by Donald Campbell in 1951 was unsuccessful.

The experience gained by Rolls-Royce and Supermarine designers from the R engine was invaluable in the subsequent development of the <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Merlin">Rolls-Royce Merlin</a> engine and the <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Spitfire</a>. A de-rated R engine, known as the Griffon, was tested in 1933, but it was not directly related to the production <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Griffon">Rolls-Royce Griffon</a> of 1939, of the same exact bore/stroke and resultant displacement figures as the "R" design. Three examples of the R engine are on public display in British museums as of 2014.

Rolls-Royce realised that the <a href="Napier%20Lion">Napier Lion</a> engine used in the 1927 <a href="Supermarine%20S.5">Supermarine S.5</a> Schneider Trophy winner had reached the peak of its development, and that for Britain's entrant in the next race to be competitive a new, more powerful engine design was required. The first configuration drawing of the "Racing H" engine, based on the <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Buzzard">Buzzard</a>, was sent to <a href="R.%20J.%20Mitchell">R. J. Mitchell</a> of <a href="Supermarine">Supermarine</a> on 3 July 1928, allowing Mitchell to start design of the new <a href="Supermarine%20S.6">S.6</a> Schneider Trophy seaplane. Shortly after this the engine's name was changed to R for "Racing". An official British Government contract to proceed with the project was not awarded until February 1929, leaving Rolls-Royce six months to develop the engine before the planned Schneider Trophy competition of that year.

The R was a physically imposing engine designed by a team led by <a href="Ernest%20Hives%2C%201st%20Baron%20Hives">Ernest Hives</a> and including <a href="Cyril%20Lovesey">Cyril Lovesey</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Rowledge">Arthur Rowledge</a> and <a href="Henry%20Royce">Henry Royce</a>. The R shared the Buzzard's <a href="Bore%20%28engine%29">bore</a>, <a href="Stroke%20%28engine%29">stroke</a> and capacity, and used the same 60-<a href="Degree%20%28angle%29">degree</a> V-12 layout. A new single-stage, double-sided <a href="supercharger">supercharger</a> impeller was designed along with revised <a href="Cylinder%20%28engine%29">cylinders</a> and strengthened <a href="connecting%20rod">connecting rod</a>s. The wet-liner <a href="cylinder%20block">cylinder block</a>s, <a href="crankcase">crankcase</a> and <a href="Propeller%20speed%20reduction%20unit">propeller reduction gear</a> castings were produced from "<a href="Hiduminium">R.R 50</a>" <a href="aluminium%20alloy">aluminium alloy</a>; and because of the short life expectancy of these engines, forged aluminium was used to replace bronze and steel in many parts. 

To make the R as compact as possible, several design modifications were made in comparison to the Buzzard: the propeller reduction gear housing was reshaped, and the <a href="Overhead%20camshaft">camshaft</a> and <a href="Rocker%20arm">rocker</a> covers were modified to <a href="Aircraft%20fairing">fair</a> into the shape of the aircraft's nose, the air intake was positioned in the vee of the engine (which also helped to avoid the ingress of spray), and beneath the engine the <a href="Automobile%20accessory%20power">auxiliaries</a> were raised a little to reduce the depth of the <a href="fuselage">fuselage</a>. The engine's length was minimised by not staggering its cylinder banks fore and aft, which meant that the connecting rods from opposing cylinders had to share a short <a href="crankshaft">crankshaft</a> bearing journal known as the "<a href="Crankpin">big end</a>". This was initially achieved by fitting one connecting rod inside the other at the lower end in a blade and fork arrangement; however, after cracking of the connecting rods was found during testing in 1931, the rod design was changed to an <a href="Connecting%20rod%23Compound%20rods">articulated type</a>.

The introduction of articulated connecting rods was regarded as a "nuisance" by <a href="Arthur%20Rubbra">Arthur Rubbra</a>, a Rolls-Royce engine designer, as there were inherent problems with the arrangement. The complicated geometry meant that a pair of rods had different effective lengths, giving a longer <a href="Stroke%20%28engine%29">stroke</a> on the articulated side; consequently the cylinder liners on that side had to be lengthened to prevent the lower <a href="piston%20ring">piston ring</a> from running out of the cylinder skirt. Articulated rods were used in the <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Goshawk">Goshawk</a> engine, but were not embodied in the later <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Merlin">Rolls-Royce Merlin</a>, for which Arthur Rowledge had designed a revised blade and fork system.

Later production R engines featured <a href="sodium">sodium-filled</a> <a href="Poppet%20valve">exhaust valve</a> stems for improved cooling, while additional modifications included a redesigned lower crankcase casting and the introduction of an <a href="Piston%20ring">oil scraper ring</a> below the piston <a href="gudgeon%20pin">gudgeon pin</a>; a measure that was carried over to the Merlin engine. A <a href="Crankshaft%23Engine%20balance">balanced crankshaft</a> was introduced in May 1931, and the <a href="compression%20ratio">compression ratio</a> on the "sprint" engines prepared for that year was raised from 6:1 to 7:1.

The <a href="ignition%20system">ignition system</a> consisted of two rear-mounted, crankshaft-driven <a href="ignition%20magneto">magneto</a>s, each supplying one of a pair of <a href="spark%20plugs">spark plugs</a> fitted to each cylinder. This is common practise for aero engines, as it ensures continued operation in the case of a single magneto failure, and has the advantage of more efficient <a href="combustion">combustion</a> over a single spark plug application.

<a href="Internal%20combustion%20engine%20cooling">Cooling</a> this large engine whilst minimising aerodynamic <a href="Drag%20%28physics%29">drag</a> posed new challenges for both the Rolls-Royce and Supermarine design teams. Traditional cooling methods using honeycomb-type <a href="radiator">radiator</a>s were known to cause high drag in flight; consequently it was decided to use the surface skins of the S.6 wings and <a href="Floats%20%28nautical%29">floats</a> as heat exchangers, employing a double-skinned structure through which the coolant could circulate. Engine oil was cooled in a similar manner using channels in the <a href="fuselage">fuselage</a> and <a href="empennage">empennage</a> skins. The S.6 was described at the time as a "flying radiator", and it had been estimated that this coolant system dissipated the equivalent of 1,000 hp (745 kW) of <a href="heat">heat</a> in flight. However, even with this system in use, engine overheating was noted during the race flights, requiring the pilots to reduce the throttle setting to maintain a safe <a href="operating%20temperature">operating temperature</a>.

A not-so-obvious cooling measure was the deliberate use of a <a href="Air-fuel%20ratio">rich fuel mixture</a>, which accounts for the frequent reports of black smoke seen issuing from the engine exhaust stubs. Although this robbed the engine of some power, it increased reliability and reduced the possibility of <a href="detonation">detonation</a> in the cylinders. 

The keys to the R engine's high <a href="power-to-weight%20ratio">power-to-weight ratio</a> were its <a href="supercharger">supercharger</a> design, ability to run at high revolutions due to its structural strength, and the special blends of fuel used. The double-sided supercharger impeller was a new development for Rolls-Royce: running at a ratio of almost 8:1, it could supply intake air at up to 18 <a href="pounds%20per%20square%20inch">pounds per square inch</a> (psi) (1.24 <a href="Bar%20%28unit%29">bar</a>) above <a href="atmospheric%20pressure">atmospheric pressure</a>, a figure known as "boost" and commonly abbreviated as "+"<a href="Variable%20%28mathematics%29">x</a>" lb". By comparison the maximum boost of the earlier <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Kestrel">Rolls-Royce Kestrel</a> design was +6 lb (0.4 bar), this figure not being achieved until 1934. The high boost pressures initially caused the <a href="spark%20plugs">spark plugs</a> to fail on test, and eventually the <a href="Lodge%20Plugs%20Ltd">Lodge</a> type X170 plug was chosen as it proved to be extremely reliable.

The development of special fuel was attributed to the work of <a href="Francis%20Rodwell%20Banks">"Rod" Banks</a>, an engineer who specialised in fuels and engine development. After using neat <a href="benzole">benzole</a> for early ground test runs; a mixture of 11% <a href="Avgas">aviation petrol</a> and 89% benzole, plus 5 <a href="cubic%20centimetre">cubic centimetre</a>s (cc) of <a href="tetra-ethyl%20lead">tetra-ethyl lead</a> per <a href="Imperial%20units%23Volume">Imperial gallon</a> (4.5 L) was tried. This blend of fuel was used to win the 1929 Schneider Trophy race, and continued to be used until June 1931. It was discovered that adding 10% <a href="methanol">methanol</a> to this mixture resulted in a 20 hp (15 kW) increase, with the further advantage of reduced fuel weight – particularly important for aircraft use – due to its lowered <a href="Relative%20density">specific gravity</a>. For the 1931 airspeed record attempt <a href="acetone">acetone</a> was added to prevent intermittent misfiring, the composition of this final blend was 30% benzole, 60% methanol, and 10% acetone, plus 4.2 cc of tetra-ethyl lead per gallon.

On an early test run the R engine produced 1,400 hp (1,040 kW) and was noted to <a href="Idle%20speed">idle</a> happily at 450 <a href="revolutions%20per%20minute">revolutions per minute</a> (rpm). With increased boost ratings and fuel developed by Banks, the R engine ultimately developed 2,530 hp (1,890 kW) at 3,200 rpm; well over double the maximum power output of the <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Buzzard">Buzzard</a>. The engine was further tested and cleared for limited sprint racing at 2,783 hp (2,075 kW) at 3,400 rpm and +21 lb (1.45 bar) of boost, but this capability was not used due to concerns with the S.6B's <a href="airframe">airframe</a> not being able to withstand the power, and the inability of the aircraft to lift the extra fuel required to meet the increased consumption.

The first run of engine "R1" took place at Rolls-Royce's <a href="Osmaston%2C%20Derby">Derby</a> factory on 7 April 1929 with "R7" running the next day. Many mechanical failures were experienced during bench testing including burnt valves, connecting rod breakages and <a href="main%20bearing">main bearing</a> seizures, while considerably more trouble than expected occurred with valve springs; at one time two or three would be found broken after a 10-minute run, but the continual redesigning and testing of components reduced all these problems. Unknown to Royce himself, the engineers had also fitted "<a href="Wellworthy%20Piston%20Rings%20Limited">Wellworthy</a>" pistons that were better able to withstand the 13 <a href="ton">ton</a>s "pressure" of each firing stroke.

Ground testing of the R involved the use of three <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Kestrel">Kestrel</a> engines: one to simulate a headwind or <a href="airspeed">airspeed</a>, one to provide ventilation of the test area, and another to cool the <a href="crankcase">crankcase</a>. Superchargers could be tested on a separate rig that was driven by another Kestrel engine. Eight men were required to run a test cell, led by the "Chief Tester" who had the tasks of logging the figures and directing the other operators. One of these chief testers was Victor Halliwell who later lost his life whilst on board the water speed record contender "<a href="Miss%20England%20II">Miss England II</a>". The conditions in the test cell were particularly unpleasant; deafness and <a href="tinnitus">tinnitus</a> lasting up to two days were experienced by test personnel even after plugging their ears with <a href="Cotton%23Uses">cotton wool</a>. Development time was short and the deafening sound of three Kestrels and an R engine running at high power for 24 hours a day took its toll on the local population. The <a href="Mayors%20in%20England">Mayor</a> of Derby stepped in and asked that the people endure the noise for the sake of British prestige; subsequently testing continued for seven months.

In the course of a 25-minute test an early R engine would consume 60 <a href="Gallon">Imperial gallons</a> (gal) (270 L) of pre-heated <a href="castor%20oil">castor oil</a>. The majority of this was spat out of the exhaust ports and smothered the test cell walls, milk being given to staff to minimise the effects of this well-known <a href="laxative">laxative</a>. Up to 200 gal (900 L) of the special fuel blend had to be mixed for each test, 80 gal (360 L) of which were used just to warm the engine to operating temperature. The same <a href="Blade%20pitch">coarse-pitch</a> <a href="propeller%20%28aircraft%29">propeller</a> used for flight trials was fitted throughout these tests.

Overseen by <a href="Cyril%20Lovesey">Cyril Lovesey</a>, flight testing commenced on 4 August 1929 in the new Supermarine S.6 at <a href="RAF%20Calshot">RAF Calshot</a>, a <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a> and <a href="flying%20boat">flying boat</a> station on <a href="Southampton%20Water">Southampton Water</a> in <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>. During pre-race <a href="Scrutineer%23Sport">scrutineering</a> tests, metal particles were found on two of the engine's 24 <a href="spark%20plugs">spark plugs</a> indicating a <a href="piston">piston</a> failure which would require an engine re-build or replacement. The competition rules did not allow an engine change, but due to the foresight of <a href="Ernest%20Hives%2C%201st%20Baron%20Hives">Ernest Hives</a>, several Rolls-Royce engineers and mechanics that were familiar with the R had travelled down to <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a> to witness the trials, and with their assistance one cylinder bank was removed, the damaged piston replaced and the cylinder refurbished. This work was completed overnight and allowed the team to continue in the competition.

Engine starting was achieved by a combination of compressed air and a hand-turned <a href="ignition%20magneto">magneto</a>; however, starting problems were encountered during pre-race testing at Calshot due to moisture in the air and water contamination of the fuel. A complicated test procedure was devised to ensure clean fuel for competition flights since more than 0.3% water content made it unusable. As expected, minor engine failures continued to be experienced, and to counter this engines and parts were transported at high speed between Derby and Calshot using an adapted <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Phantom%20I">Rolls-Royce Phantom I</a> motor car. Travelling mostly after dark, this vehicle became known as the "Phantom of The Night."

According to <a href="Arthur%20Rubbra">Arthur Rubbra</a>'s memoirs, a de-rated version of the R engine, known by the name "Griffon" at that time, was tested in 1933. This engine, "R11", was used for "Moderately Supercharged Buzzard development" (which was not proceeded with until much later), and bore no direct relationship to the volume-produced <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Griffon">Griffon</a> of the 1940s.

The pre-production Griffon I shared the R engine's <a href="Bore%20%28engine%29">bore</a> and <a href="Stroke%20%28engine%29">stroke</a>, but was otherwise a completely new design that first ran in the Experimental Department in November 1939. Although this single engine was never flown, the production version, the Griffon II, first flew in 1941 installed in the <a href="Fairey%20Firefly">Fairey Firefly</a>. A significant difference between the R and the production Griffon was the re-location of the <a href="camshaft">camshaft</a> and supercharger drives to the front of the engine to reduce overall length. Another length-reducing measure was the use of a single magneto (the R had two, mounted at the rear), this again was moved to the front of the engine.

Further possible development work on the R engine was discussed in <a href="The%20National%20Archives%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">The National Archives</a>' file AVIA 13/122, which contains a proposal from the <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Establishment">Royal Aircraft Establishment</a> dated October and November 1932, to test four engines to destruction. This document states that there were five engines available for test purposes, the fifth to be used for a standard <a href="Type%20certificate">Type Test</a> at high revolutions.

Although not directly related to the <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Spitfire</a>, the <a href="Supermarine">Supermarine</a> engineers gained valuable experience of high-speed flight with the S.5 and S.6 aircraft, their next project being the <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Goshawk">Rolls-Royce Goshawk</a>-powered <a href="Supermarine%20Type%20224">Supermarine Type 224</a> prototype fighter aircraft. Technological advances used in the R engine, such as sodium-cooled valves and spark plugs able to operate under high boost pressures, were incorporated into the <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Merlin">Rolls-Royce Merlin</a> design. The author Steve Holter sums up the design of the Rolls-Royce R with these words:

The Schneider Trophy was a prestigious annual prize competition for <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a>s that was first held in 1913. The 1926 race was the first where all the teams fielded pilots from their armed forces, the <a href="Air%20Ministry">Air Ministry</a> financing a British team known as the <a href="High%20Speed%20Flight%20RAF">High Speed Flight</a> drawn from the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>. Sometimes known simply as The Flight, the team was formed at the <a href="Marine%20Aircraft%20Experimental%20Establishment">Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment</a>, <a href="Felixstowe">Felixstowe</a>, in preparation for the 1927 race in which Supermarine's Mitchell-designed, <a href="Napier%20Lion">Napier Lion</a>-powered <a href="Supermarine%20S.5">Supermarine S.5</a>s placed first and second. 1927 was the last annual competition, the event then moving onto a biannual schedule to allow more development time between races. 
During the 1929 race at <a href="Cowes">Cowes</a> between Great Britain and Italy, <a href="Richard%20Waghorn">Richard Waghorn</a> flying the <a href="Supermarine%20S.6">Supermarine S.6</a> with the new Rolls-Royce R engine retained the Schneider Trophy for Great Britain with an average speed of , and also gained the 50 km and 100 km (31 mi and 62 mi) world speed records. The records were subsequently beaten when <a href="Richard%20Atcherley">Richard Atcherley</a> later registered higher speeds when he completed his laps of the circuit. The Italian team placed second and fourth using <a href="Fiat%20AS.3">Fiat AS.3</a> V-12-powered <a href="Macchi%20M.52">Macchi M.52</a> aircraft. Another racing seaplane, the <a href="Fiat%20C.29">Fiat C.29</a> powered by the <a href="Fiat%20AS.5">AS.5</a> engine attended the contest but did not compete.

More comparable to the R engine was the <a href="Fiat%20AS.6">Fiat AS.6</a> engine developed for the 1931 contest; effectively a coupled, double AS.5 that suffered from technical problems. With the assistance of Rod Banks, the AS.6 powered the <a href="Macchi%20M.C.72">Macchi M.C.72</a> to a new speed record for piston-powered seaplanes in 1934 of 440.6 mph (709.2 km/h), a record that still stands as of 2009.

In 1931 the British Government withdrew financial support, but a private donation of £100,000 from <a href="Lucy%2C%20Lady%20Houston">Lucy, Lady Houston</a> allowed Supermarine to compete on 13 September using the R-powered <a href="Supermarine%20S.6B">Supermarine S.6B</a>. For this race the engine's rating was increased by to . The Italian and French entrants however, failed to ready their aircraft and crews in time for the competition, and the remaining British team set both a new world speed record at 379 mph (610 km/h) and, unopposed, won the trophy outright with a third consecutive victory. "The Flight" was wound up within weeks of the 1931 win as there were to be no more Schneider Trophy contests. The original Trophy is on display in the <a href="Science%20Museum%20%28London%29">London Science Museum</a> along with the S.6B that secured it, as well as the R engine that powered this aircraft for the subsequent airspeed record flight.

New airspeed records were set after the 1929 and 1931 Schneider Trophy contests, both achieved using the R engine. In the two decades before World War II, the quest to break the land speed record was hotly contested, particularly so in the early 1930s. <a href="Aircraft%20engine">Aero engines</a> were often used to power wheeled vehicles to ever-higher speeds, chosen because of their high <a href="power-to-weight%20ratio">power-to-weight ratio</a>s: the <a href="Liberty%20L-12">Liberty engine</a>, <a href="Napier%20Lion">Napier Lion</a> and the <a href="Sunbeam%20Matabele">Sunbeam Matabele</a> were among the engine types used in the 1920s. The Rolls-Royce R was the latest development in high-powered aero engine design at the time, and was chosen by several makers of land speed record-contending cars; the engine was also chosen for <a href="Powerboating">powerboats</a> attempting the water speed record. One car and two boats successfully used the combined power of two R engines.

Immediately after the 1929 Schneider Trophy contest <a href="Squadron%20Leader">Squadron Leader</a> <a href="Augustus%20Orlebar">Augustus Orlebar</a>, commanding officer of the High Speed Flight, set a new <a href="Flight%20airspeed%20record">airspeed record</a> of 355.8 mph (572.6 km/h) using <a href="Supermarine%20S.6">Supermarine S.6</a>, "N247."
On 29 September 1931, barely two weeks after the British team had secured the Schneider Trophy outright, <a href="Flight%20Lieutenant">Flight Lieutenant</a> <a href="George%20Stainforth">George Stainforth</a> broke the world airspeed record in a Rolls-Royce R-powered <a href="Supermarine%20S.6B">Supermarine S.6B</a>, serial "S1595", reaching an average speed of 407.5 mph (655.67 km/h). It had been intended to also use the identical sister aircraft, "S1596", for the attempt but Stainforth had capsized it on 16 September whilst testing a propeller.


<a href="Malcolm%20Campbell">Sir Malcolm Campbell</a>, and later his son <a href="Donald%20Campbell">Donald</a>, used R engines from 1931 to 1951. At Sir Malcolm's <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">knighthood</a> ceremony in February 1931, <a href="George%20V%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George V</a> expressed great interest in the R and asked many questions about its fuel consumption and performance.

In 1932, Campbell stated that he "... was fortunate in procuring a special R.R. Schneider Trophy engine" for his land speed record car to replace its <a href="Napier%20Lion">Napier Lion</a>. Lent to him by Rolls-Royce, this engine was either "R25" or "R31". By February 1933 the car, named "<a href="Campbell-Railton%20Blue%20Bird">Blue Bird</a>" had been rebuilt to accommodate the larger engine and was running at <a href="Daytona%20Beach%20Road%20Course">Daytona</a>.

In late 1933 Campbell bought engine "R37" from Rolls-Royce; and had also been lent "R17" and "R19" by <a href="Charles%20Wakefield%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Wakefield">Lord Wakefield</a>, and "R39" by Rolls-Royce. He then lent "R17" to <a href="George%20Eyston">George Eyston</a>. Once he had achieved the record on 3 September 1935 at the <a href="Bonneville%20Speedway">Bonneville Speedway</a>, Campbell retired from further land speed endeavours.

Lord Wakefield arranged for a replica of the Rolls-Royce R to be exhibited at the 1933 <a href="British%20International%20Motor%20Show">Motor Show</a>, held at <a href="Olympia%2C%20London">Olympia, London</a>. A press report from the event provides an insight into the public perception of the engine:

"Blue Bird" is now on display at the <a href="Daytona%20International%20Speedway">Daytona International Speedway</a>. 
During the mid-1930s, George Eyston set many speed records with his "<a href="Speed%20of%20the%20Wind">Speed of the Wind</a>" car, powered by an unsupercharged <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Kestrel">Rolls-Royce Kestrel</a>. In 1937 he built a massive new car, "<a href="Thunderbolt%20%28car%29">Thunderbolt</a>", powered by two R engines to attempt the absolute land speed record. At first Eyston experienced <a href="clutch">clutch</a> failure due to the combined power of the engines. Nevertheless, he took the record in November 1937, reaching 312 mph (502 km/h), and in 1938 when "Thunderbolt" reached 357.5 mph (575 km/h). When first built at <a href="Bean%20Cars">Bean Industries</a> in <a href="Tipton">Tipton</a>, the nearside engine fitted to "Thunderbolt" was "R27" which had powered "S1595" when it set the air speed record in 1931. The other was "R25", used by the same aircraft to win the Schneider Trophy two weeks earlier. Eyston had also borrowed "R17" from Sir Malcolm Campbell and, with the continuing support that Rolls-Royce extended to both Campbell and Eyston, he also had the option of using "R39".

"
Two R engines, "R17" and "R19", were built for <a href="Henry%20Segrave">Sir Henry Segrave</a>'s twin-engined water speed record boat "<a href="Miss%20England%20II">Miss England II</a>", this craft being ready for trials on <a href="Windermere">Windermere</a> by June 1930. On <a href="Friday%20the%2013th">Friday 13</a> June, Segrave was fatally injured and a Rolls-Royce technical advisor, Victor Halliwell, was killed when "Miss England II" capsized at high speed after possibly hitting a log. Shortly before his death Segrave learnt that he had set a new water speed record of just under 100 mph (160 km/h). On 18 July 1932, <a href="Kaye%20Don">Kaye Don</a> set a new world water speed record of on <a href="Loch%20Lomond">Loch Lomond</a> in a new boat, "<a href="Miss%20England%20III">Miss England III</a>", which also used engines "R17" and "R19".

In late 1935, Sir Malcolm Campbell decided to challenge the water speed record. At that point he had two <a href="Napier%20Lion">Napier Lion</a>s and one Rolls-Royce R engine, "R37" at his disposal, and it was decided to install the R engine in "<a href="Blue%20Bird%20K3">Blue Bird K3</a>". During trials on <a href="Loch%20Lomond">Loch Lomond</a> in June 1937 the engine was "slightly damaged ... because of trouble with the circulating water system". In August 1937 "Blue Bird K3" was taken to <a href="Lake%20Maggiore">Lake Maggiore</a> in Italy where "the modified [circulation] system worked perfectly with a second engine", "R39".

"R39" was again used in 1939 in "<a href="Blue%20Bird%20K4">Blue Bird K4</a>". In 1947 Campbell unsuccessfully converted "K4" to jet power using a <a href="de%20Havilland%20Goblin">de Havilland Goblin</a> engine. After Campbell's death from natural causes in 1948, Donald Campbell bought "K4" for a nominal sum as well as the 1935 record car when his father's effects were auctioned. He also purchased "R37" back from a car dealer and reinstalled it in "K4". Attempts on the record were made in 1949, and again in 1951 when "R37" was "damaged beyond any immediate repair" by overheating. Another attempt was made later in the year using "R39", but "K4" suffered a structural failure and sank in <a href="Coniston%20Water">Coniston Water</a>. It was recovered and broken up on the shore.

The care and maintenance of the Campbell's R engines was entrusted to <a href="Leo%20Villa">Leo Villa</a>, a <a href="Cockney">Cockney</a> born to a Swiss father, who was described as "the man behind the Campbells" and a central figure who "fitted the first nut to the first bolt". Villa learnt his trade of "aircraft mechanic" in the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a>; his first job was fitting <a href="Beardmore%20160%20hp">Beardmore 160 hp</a> engines to airframes. After World War I he worked for a motor racing company and participated as co-driver and mechanic in several races.

Villa was first employed by Malcolm Campbell in 1922, and continued in the service of Donald Campbell until 1967, when Campbell was killed during a record attempt on Coniston Water. He was the chief caretaker of their R engines until the last R-powered record attempt in 1951, after which his responsibilities centred on Campbell's jet engines. Villa's many responsibilities included installing and removing the engines, repairing and tuning them, and operating the compressed air and magneto for starting them. During the World War II years, he was responsible for the upkeep of "Blue Bird K4" and the spare R engines, but unknown to him they had been sold along with "K3". Villa eventually took the three R engines to <a href="Thomson%20%26amp%3B%20Taylor">Thomson & Taylor</a> at <a href="Brooklands">Brooklands</a> for long-term storage.

His relationship with Malcolm Campbell was strained at times: Campbell, with no engineering background, would often question Villa's intimate knowledge of the R engine, but his relations with Donald Campbell were much better, as they were of a similar age. At <a href="Lake%20Garda">Lake Garda</a> in 1951 Villa noted the willingness of "Don" to help with engineering tasks, and the difficulties of working on the R engine:

"Note:"


Nineteen R engines were produced at Derby between 1929 and 1931, all given odd serial numbers. This was a Rolls-Royce convention when the propeller rotated anticlockwise when viewed from the front, but an exception was made for "R17", the sole clockwise-rotation R engine. There is some confusion as to whether 19 or 20 R engines were produced. In his notes Leo Villa refers to an "R18" engine, but according to Holter this may have been "R17" converted to clockwise rotation at the request of Malcolm Campbell rather than an additional example. There was no "R13" as Rolls-Royce never used the number 13 in any of their designations. A summary production list is given below:



The <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force%20Museum%20London">Royal Air Force Museum London</a> at Hendon has a Rolls-Royce R on display (museum number 65E1139) that came to the museum in November 1965 from <a href="RAF%20Cranwell">RAF Cranwell</a>. According to the museum's records, before that it was with George Eyston as one of "<a href="Thunderbolt%20%28car%29">Thunderbolt's</a>" record engines. Its data plate states that it is "R25" under <a href="Air%20Ministry">Air Ministry</a> contract number A106961 which makes it the second 1931 race engine delivered to <a href="RAF%20Calshot">RAF Calshot</a>. 
The <a href="Science%20Museum%20%28London%29">London Science Museum</a> has an R engine on display which is catalogued as a stand-alone item, inventory number 1948-310. This is "R27", the second sprint engine prepared for the successful air speed record attempt, and later used in "Thunderbolt". The Science Museum also has S.6B, "S1595", (winner of the 1931 race and the final air speed record aircraft) on display.
The Filching Manor Motor Museum has "R37" which is destined to be fitted in its restoration of the "Blue Bird K3" water speed record boat.

These three engines are the only ones listed by the British Aircraft Preservation Council/Rolls-Royce Heritage Trust. The <a href="Solent%20Sky">Solent Sky</a> museum's S.6A, "N248," (a competing aircraft in the 1929 race as an S.6, and stand-by for the 1931 race, modified as an S.6A) does not contain an R engine.

Donnchadh (; Latin: Duncanus; English: Duncan) was a <a href="Gall-Gaidhil">Gall-Gaidhil</a> prince and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Scottish</a> <a href="magnate">magnate</a> in what is now south-western Scotland, whose career stretched from the last quarter of the 12th century until his death in 1250. His father, <a href="Gille-Brighde%20of%20Galloway">Gille-Brighde of Galloway</a>, and his uncle, <a href="Uhtred%20of%20Galloway">Uhtred of Galloway</a>, were the two rival sons of <a href="Fergus%20of%20Galloway">Fergus</a>, Prince or Lord of <a href="Galloway">Galloway</a>. As a result of Gille-Brighde's conflict with Uhtred and the Scottish monarch <a href="William%20I%20of%20Scotland">William the Lion</a>, Donnchadh became a hostage of <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">King Henry II of England</a>. He probably remained in England for almost a decade before returning north on the death of his father. Although denied succession to all the lands of Galloway, he was granted lordship over <a href="Carrick%2C%20Scotland">Carrick</a> in the north.

Allied to <a href="John%20de%20Courcy">John de Courcy</a>, Donnchadh fought battles in Ireland and acquired land there that he subsequently lost. A patron of religious houses, particularly <a href="Melrose%20Abbey">Melrose Abbey</a> and <a href="North%20Berwick%20priory">North Berwick priory</a> <a href="nunnery">nunnery</a>, he attempted to establish a <a href="Monasteries%20in%20Scotland">monastery</a> in his own territory, at <a href="Crossraguel%20Abbey">Crossraguel</a>. He married the daughter of <a href="Alan%20fitz%20Walter">Alan fitz Walter</a>, a leading member of the family later known as the <a href="House%20of%20Stewart">House of Stewart</a>—future monarchs of Scotland and England. Donnchadh was the first <a href="earl%20of%20Carrick">mormaer or earl of Carrick</a>, a region he ruled for more than six decades, making him one of the longest serving magnates in <a href="Scotland%20in%20the%20High%20Middle%20Ages">medieval Scotland</a>. His descendants include the <a href="House%20of%20Bruce">Bruce</a> and Stewart Kings of Scotland, and probably the <a href="Clan%20Campbell">Campbell</a> <a href="Duke%20of%20Argyll">Dukes of Argyll</a>.

Donnchadh's career is not well documented in the surviving sources. <a href="Charter">Charter</a>s provide a little information about some of his activities, but overall their usefulness is limited; this is because no charter-collections (called <a href="cartulary">cartularies</a>) from the <a href="Galwegian%20Gaelic">Gaelic south-west</a> have survived the Middle Ages, and the only surviving charters relevant to Donnchadh's career come from the heavily <a href="Anglo-Norman%20language">Normanised English</a>-speaking area to the east. Principally, the relevant charters record his acts of patronage towards religious houses, but incidental details mentioned in the body of these texts and the witness lists subscribed to them are useful for other matters.

Some English government records describe his activities in relation to <a href="Lordship%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a>, and occasional <a href="chronicle">chronicle</a> entries from England and the English-speaking regions of what became south-eastern Scotland record other important details. Aside from the "<a href="Chronicle%20of%20Melrose">Chronicle of Melrose</a>", the most significant of these sources are the works of <a href="Roger%20of%20Hoveden">Roger of Hoveden</a>, and the material preserved in the writings of <a href="John%20of%20Fordun">John of Fordun</a> and <a href="Walter%20Bower">Walter Bower</a>.

Roger of Hoveden wrote two important works: the "Gesta Henrici II" ("Deeds of Henry II", alternatively titled "Gesta Henrici et Ricardi", "Deeds of Henry and Richard") and the "Chronica", the latter a re-worked and supplemented version of the former. These works are the most important and valuable sources for Scottish history in the late 12th century. The "Gesta Henrici II" covers the period from 1169 to April 1192, and the "Chronica" covers events until 1201. Roger of Hoveden is particularly important in relation to what is now south-western Scotland, the land of the <a href="Gall-Gaidhil">Gall-Gaidhil</a>. He served as an emissary in the region in 1174 on behalf of the English monarch, and thus his account of, for example, the approach of Donnchadh's father Gille-Brighde towards the English king comes from a witness. Historians rely on Roger's writings for a number of important details about Donnchadh's life: that Gille-Brighde handed Donnchadh over as a hostage to <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II</a> under the care of Hugh de Morwic, <a href="High%20Sheriff%20of%20Cumberland">Sheriff of Cumberland</a>; that Donnchcadh married the daughter of <a href="Alan%20fitz%20Walter">Alan fitz Walter</a> under protest from the Scottish king; and that Donnchadh fought a battle in Ireland in 1197 assisting <a href="John%20de%20Courcy">John de Courcy</a>, Prince of Ulster.

Another important chronicle source is the material preserved in John of Fordun's "Chronica gentis Scottorum" ("Chronicle of the Scottish people") and Walter Bower's "<a href="Scotichronicon">Scotichronicon</a>". John of Fordun's work, which survives on its own, was incorporated in the following century into the work of Bower. Fordun's "Chronica" was written and compiled between 1384 and August 1387. Despite the apparently late date, Scottish textual historian <a href="Dauvit%20Broun">Dauvit Broun</a> has shown that Fordun's work in fact consists of two earlier pieces, "<a href="Gesta%20Annalia%20I">Gesta Annalia I</a>" and "<a href="Gesta%20Annalia%20II">Gesta Annalia II</a>", the former written before April 1285 and covering the period from King <a href="M%C3%A1el%20Coluim%20mac%20Donnchada">Máel Coluim mac Donnchada</a> (Malcolm III, died 1093) to 2 February 1285. "Gesta Annalia I" appears to have been based on an even earlier text, about the descendants of <a href="Saint%20Margaret%20of%20Scotland">Saint Margaret of Scotland</a>, produced at <a href="Dunfermline%20Abbey">Dunfermline Abbey</a>. Thus material from these works concerning the late 12th- and early 13th-century Gall-Gaidhil may represent, despite the apparent late date, reliable contemporary or near-contemporary accounts.

Donnchadh's territory lay in what is now Scotland south of the <a href="River%20Forth">River Forth</a>, a multi-ethnic region during the late 12th century. North of the Forth was the Gaelic kingdom of Scotland ("Alba"), which under its partially Normanised kings exercised direct or indirect control over most of the region to the south as far as the borders of <a href="Northumberland">Northumberland</a> and <a href="Cumberland">Cumberland</a>. <a href="Lothian">Lothian</a> and <a href="the%20Merse">the Merse</a> were the heartlands of the northern part of the old English <a href="Earl%20of%20Northumbria">Earldom of Northumbria</a>, and in the late 12th century the people of these regions, as well as the people of <a href="Lauderdale">Lauderdale</a>, <a href="Eskdale%2C%20Dumfries%20and%20Galloway">Eskdale</a>, <a href="Liddesdale">Liddesdale</a>, and most of <a href="Teviotdale">Teviotdale</a> and <a href="Annandale">Annandale</a>, were English in language and regarded themselves as English by ethnicity, despite having been under the control of the king of the Scots for at least a century.

<a href="Clydesdale">Clydesdale</a> (or Strathclyde) was the heartland of the old <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Strathclyde">Kingdom of Strathclyde</a>; by Donnchadh's day the Scots had settled many English and Continental Europeans (principally <a href="Flemings">Flemings</a>) in the region, and administered it through the sheriffdom of Lanark. Gaelic too had penetrated much of the old Northumbrian and Strathclyde territory, coming from the west, south-west and the north, a situation that led historian <a href="Alex%20Woolf">Alex Woolf</a> to compare the region to <a href="the%20Balkans">the Balkans</a>. The <a href="Brythonic%20languages">British language</a> of the area, as a result of such developments, was probably either dead or almost dead, perhaps surviving only in the uplands of Clydesdale, <a href="Tweeddale">Tweeddale</a> and Annandale.

The rest of the region was settled by the people called "Gall-Gaidhil" (modern Scottish Gaelic: "Gall-Ghàidheil") in their own language, variations of "Gallwedienses" in <a href="Medieval%20Latin">Latin</a>, and normally <a href="Galwegian%20Gaelic">Galwegians</a> or Gallovidians in modern English. References in the 11th century to the kingdom of the Gall-Gaidhil centre it far to the north of what is now <a href="Galloway">Galloway</a>. <a href="Kingarth">Kingarth</a> ("Cenn Garadh") and <a href="Eigg">Eigg</a> ("Eic") were described as "in Galloway" ("Gallgaidelaib") by the "Martyrology of Óengus", in contrast to <a href="Whithorn">Whithorn</a> —part of modern Galloway—which was named as lying within another kingdom, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20the%20Rhinns">The Rhinns</a> ("Na Renna"). These areas had been part of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Northumbria">Kingdom of Northumbria</a> until the 9th century, and afterward were transformed by a process very poorly documented, but probably carried out by numerous small bands of culturally Scandinavian but linguistically Gaelic warrior-settlers moving in from Ireland and southern Argyll. "Galloway" today only refers to the lands of <a href="Rhinns">Rhinns</a>, <a href="Farines">Farines</a>, Glenken, Desnes Mór and Desnes Ioan (that is, <a href="Wigtownshire">Wigtownshire</a> and the <a href="Stewartry%20of%20Kirkcudbright">Stewartry of Kirkcudbright</a>), but this is due to the territorial changes that took place in and around Donnchadh's lifetime rather than being the contemporary definition. For instance, a 12th-century piece of <a href="marginalia">marginalia</a> located the island of <a href="Ailsa%20Craig">Ailsa Craig</a> "lying between "Gallgaedelu" [Galloway] and "Cend Tiri" [Kintyre]", while a charter of <a href="M%C3%A1el%20Coluim%20IV">Máel Coluim IV</a> ("Malcolm IV") describes <a href="Strathgryfe">Strathgryfe</a>, <a href="Cunninghame">Cunningham</a>, <a href="Kyle%2C%20Ayrshire">Kyle</a> and Carrick as the four "cadrez" (probably from "ceathramh", "quarter"s) of Galloway; an Irish annal entry for the year 1154 designated galleys from <a href="Isle%20of%20Arran">Arran</a>, Kintyre, the Isle of Man as "Gallghaoidhel", "Galwegian".

By the middle of the 12th century the former territory of the kingdom of the Rhinns was part of Galloway kingdom, but the area to the north was not. Strathgryfe, Kyle and Cunningham had come under the control of the Scottish king in the early 12th century, much of it given over to soldiers of French or Anglo-French origin. Strathgryfe and most of Kyle had been given to <a href="Walter%20fitz%20Alan">Walter fitz Alan</a> under <a href="David%20I%20of%20Scotland">King David I</a>, with <a href="Hugh%20de%20Morville%2C%20Constable%20of%20Scotland">Hugh de Morville</a> taking Cunningham. <a href="Strathnith">Strathnith</a> still had a Gaelic ruler (ancestor of the famous <a href="Thomas%20Randolph%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Moray">Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray</a>), but he was not part of the kingdom of Galloway. The rest of the region—the Rhinns, Farines, Carrick, Desnes Mór and Desnes Ioan, and the sparsely settled uplands of Glenken—was probably under the control of the sons of <a href="Fergus%20of%20Galloway">Fergus</a>, <a href="King%20of%20Galloway">King of Galloway</a>, in the years before Donnchadh's career in the region.

Donnchadh was the son of <a href="Gilla%20Brighde%2C%20Lord%20of%20Galloway">Gille-Brighde</a>, son of Fergus, king of the Gall-Gaidhil. Donnchadh's ancestry cannot be traced further; no patronymic is known for Fergus from contemporary sources, and when Fergus' successors enumerate their ancestors in documents, they never go earlier than he does. The name Gille-Brighde, used by Donnchadh's father (Fergus' son), was also the name of the father of <a href="Somerled">Somhairle</a>, <a href="Lord%20of%20Argyll">petty king of Argyll</a> in the third quarter of the 12th century. As the original territory of the Gall-Gaidhil kingdom probably adjoined or included Argyll, Alex Woolf has suggested that Fergus and Somhairle were brothers or cousins.

There is a "body of circumstantial evidence" that suggests Donnchadh's mother was a daughter or sister of <a href="Donnchadh%20II%2C%20Earl%20of%20Fife">Donnchadh II, Earl of Fife</a>. This includes Donnchadh's association with the <a href="Cistercian">Cistercian</a> <a href="nunnery%20of%20North%20Berwick">nunnery of North Berwick</a>, founded by Donnchadh II of Fife's father, <a href="Donnchad%20I%2C%20Earl%20of%20Fife">Donnchadh I of Fife</a>; close ties seem to have existed between the two families, while Donnchadh's own name is further evidence. The historian who suggested this in 2000, <a href="Richard%20Oram">Richard Oram</a>, came to regard this conjecture as certain by 2004.
Roger of Hoveden described <a href="Uhtred%20of%20Galloway">Uhtred of Galloway</a> as a "consanguinus" ("cousin") of King Henry II of England, an assertion that has given rise to the theory that, since Gille-Brighde is never described as such, they must have been from different mothers. Fergus must therefore, according to the theory, have had two wives, one of whom was a bastard daughter of <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry I</a>; that is, Uhtred and his descendants were related to the <a href="Angevin%20kings%20of%20England">English royal family</a>, while Gille-Brighde and his descendants were not. According to historian <a href="G.W.S.%20Barrow">G.W.S. Barrow</a>, the theory is disproved by one English royal document, written in the name of <a href="John%20of%20England">King John of England</a>, which likewise asserts that Donnchadh was John's cousin.

It is unclear how many siblings Donnchadh had, but two at least are known. The first, Máel Coluim, led the forces that besieged Gille-Brighde's brother Uhtred on "Dee island" (probably <a href="Threave%20Castle">Threave</a>) in Galloway in 1174. This Máel Coluim captured Uhtred, who subsequently, in addition to being blinded and castrated, had his tongue cut out. Nothing more is known of Máel Coluim's life; there is speculation by some modern historians that he was illegitimate. Another brother appears in the records of <a href="Paisley%20Abbey">Paisley Abbey</a>. In 1233, one Gille-Chonaill Manntach, "the Stammerer" (recorded "Gillokonel Manthac"), gave evidence regarding a land dispute in Strathclyde; the document described him as the brother of the Earl of Carrick, who at that time was Donnchadh.

In 1160, <a href="M%C3%A1el%20Coluim%20mac%20Eanric">Máel Coluim mac Eanric</a> (Malcolm IV), king of the Scots, forced Fergus into retirement and brought Galloway under his overlordship. It is likely that from 1161 until 1174, Fergus' sons Gille-Brighde and Uhtred shared the lordship of the Gall-Gaidhil under the Scottish king's authority, with Gille-Brighde in the west and Uhtred in the east. When in 1174 the Scottish king <a href="William%20the%20Lion">William the Lion</a> was captured during an invasion of England, the brothers responded by rebelling against the Scottish monarch. Subsequently, they fought each other, with Donnchadh's father ultimately prevailing.

Having defeated his brother, Gille-Brighde unsuccessfully sought to become a direct vassal of Henry II, king of England. An agreement was obtained with Henry in 1176, Gille-Brighde promising to pay him 1000 <a href="mark%20%28money%29">mark</a>s of silver and handing over his son Donnchadh as a hostage. Donnchadh was taken into the care of Hugh de Morwic, <a href="High%20Sheriff%20of%20Cumberland">sheriff of Cumberland</a>. The agreement seems to have included recognising Donnchadh's right to inherit Gille-Brighde's lands, for nine years later, in the aftermath of Gille-Brighde's death, when Uhtred's son <a href="Lochlann%20of%20Galloway">Lochlann</a> (Roland) invaded western Galloway, Roger of Hoveden described the action as "contrary to [Henry's] prohibition".

The activities of Donnchadh's father Gille-Brighde after 1176 are unclear, but some time before 1184 King William raised an army to punish Gille-Brighde "and the other Galwegians who had wasted his land and slain his vassals"; he held off the endeavour, probably because he was worried about the response of Gille-Brighde's protector Henry II. There were raids on William's territory until Gille-Brighde's death in 1185. The death of Gille-Brighde prompted Donnchadh's cousin Lochlann, supported by the Scottish king, to attempt a takeover, thus threatening Donnchadh's inheritance. At that time Donnchadh was still a hostage in the care of Hugh de Morwic.

The "Gesta Annalia I" claimed that Donnchadh's patrimony was defended by chieftains called Somhairle ("Samuel"), Gille-Patraic, and Eanric Mac Cennetig ("Henry Mac Kennedy"). Lochlann and his army met these men in battle on 4 July 1185 and, according to the "Chronicle of Melrose", killed Gille-Patraic and a substantial number of his warriors. Another battle took place on 30 September, and although Lochlann's forces were probably victorious, killing opponent leader Gille-Coluim, the encounter led to the death of Lochlann's unnamed brother. Lochlann's activities provoked a response from King Henry who, according to historian Richard Oram, "was not prepared to accept a "fait accompli" that disinherited the son of a useful vassal, flew in the face of the settlement which he had imposed ... and deprived him of influence over a vitally strategic zone on the north-west periphery of his realm".

According to Hoveden, in May 1186 Henry ordered the king and magnates of Scotland to subdue Lochlann; in response Lochlann "collected numerous horse and foot and obstructed the entrances to Galloway and its roads to what extent he could". Richard Oram did not believe that the Scots really intended to do this, as Lochlann was their dependent and probably acted with their consent; this, Oram argued, explains why Henry himself raised an army and marched north to <a href="Carlisle%2C%20Cumbria">Carlisle</a>. When Henry arrived he instructed King William and his brother <a href="David%20of%20Huntingdon">David, Earl of Huntingdon</a>, to come to Carlisle, and to bring Lochlann with them.

Lochlann ignored Henry's summons until an embassy consisting of <a href="Hugh%20de%20Puiset">Hugh de Puiset</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Durham">Bishop of Durham</a> and Justiciar <a href="Ranulf%20de%20Glanville">Ranulf de Glanville</a> provided him with hostages as a guarantee of his safety; when he agreed to travel to Carlisle with the king's ambassadors. Hoveden wrote that Lochlann was allowed to keep the land that his father Uhtred had held "on the day he was alive and dead", but that the land of Gille-Brighde that was claimed by Donnchadh, son of Gille-Brighde, would be settled in Henry's court, to which Lochlann would be summoned. Lochlann agreed to these terms. King William and Earl David swore an oath to enforce the agreement, with <a href="Jocelin%20%28Bishop%20of%20Glasgow%29">Jocelin</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Glasgow">Bishop of Glasgow</a>, instructed to <a href="excommunicate">excommunicate</a> any party that should breach their oath.

There is no record of any subsequent court hearing, but the "Gesta Annalia I" relates that Donnchadh was granted Carrick on condition of peace with Lochlann, and emphasises the role of King William (as opposed to Henry) in resolving the conflict. Richard Oram has pointed out that Donnchadh's grant to Melrose Abbey between 1189 and 1198 was witnessed by his cousin Lochlann, evidence perhaps that relations between the two had become more cordial. Although no details are given any contemporary source, Donnchadh gained possession of some of his father's land in the west of the kingdom of Gall-Gaidhil, namely the "earldom" of Carrick.

When Donnchadh adopted or was given the title of earl (Latin: "comes"), or in his own language "<a href="mormaer">mormaer</a>", is a debated question. Historian <a href="Alan%20Orr%20Anderson">Alan Orr Anderson</a> argued that he began using the title of "comes" between 1214 and 1216, based on Donnchadh's appearance as a witness to two charters issued by Thomas de Colville; the first, known as Melrose 193 (this being its number in <a href="Cosmo%20Innes">Cosmo Innes</a>'s printed version of the cartulary), was dated by Anderson to 1214. In this charter, Donnchadh has no title. By contrast Donnchadh was styled "comes" in a charter dated by Anderson to 1216, Melrose 192.

Oram pointed out that Donnchadh was styled "comes" in a grant to Melrose Abbey witnessed by Richard de Morville (Melrose 32), who died in 1196. If the wording in this charter is accurate, then Donnchadh was using the title before Richard's death: that is, in or before 1196. Furthermore, while Anderson dated Melrose 192 with reference to Abbot William III de Courcy (abbot of Melrose from 1215 to 1216), Oram identified Abbot William as Abbot William II (abbot from 1202 to 1206). Whenever Donnchadh adopted the title, he is the first known "earl" of the region.

Carrick was located in the <a href="Firth%20of%20Clyde">Firth of Clyde</a>, in the <a href="Irish%20Sea">Irish Sea</a> region far from the main centres of Scottish and Anglo-Norman influence lying to its east and south-east. Carrick was separated from Kyle in the north and north-east by the <a href="River%20Doon">River Doon</a>, and from Galloway proper by Glenapp and by the adjacent hills and forests. There were three main rivers, the Doon, the <a href="River%20Girvan">Girvan</a> and the <a href="River%20Stinchar">Stinchar</a>, though most of the province was hilly, meaning that most wealth came from <a href="animal%20husbandry">animal husbandry</a> rather than <a href="arable%20land">arable farming</a>. The population of Carrick, like that in neighbouring Galloway, consisted of kin groups governed by a "chief" or "captain" ("cenn", Latin "capitaneus"). Above these captains was the "Cenn Cineoil" (""kenkynolle""), the "kin-captain" of Carrick, a position held by the mormaer; it was not until after Donnchadh's death that these two positions were separated. The best recorded groups are Donnchadh's own group (known only as "de Carrick", "of Carrick") and the <a href="Clan%20Kennedy">Mac Cennétig (Kennedy) family</a>, who seem to have provided the earldom's hereditary stewards.

The population was governed under these leaders by a customary law that remained distinct from the <a href="common%20law%20of%20Scotland">common law of Scotland</a> for the remainder of the Middle Ages. One documented aspect of Carrick and Galloway law was the power of sergeants (an original Gaelic word Latinised as "Kethres"), officials of the earl or of other captains, to claim one night of free hospitality (a privilege called "sorryn et frithalos"), and to accuse and arrest with little restriction. The personal <a href="demesne">demesne</a>, or lands, of the earl was probably extensive in Donnchadh's time; in 1260, during the minority of Donnchadh's descendant Countess <a href="Marjory%20of%20Carrick">Marjory of Carrick</a>, an assessment made by the Scottish king showed that the earls had estates throughout the province, in upland locations like <a href="Straiton">Straiton</a>, Glengennet and Bennan, as well as in the east in locations such as <a href="Turnberry%20Castle">Turnberry</a> and Dalquharran.

Records exist for Donnchadh's religious patronage, and these records provide evidence for Donnchadh's associates as well as the earl himself. Around 1200 Earl Donnchadh allowed the monks of <a href="Melrose%20Abbey">Melrose Abbey</a> use of <a href="salt%20evaporation%20pond">saltpan</a>s from his land at Turnberry. Between 1189 and 1198 he had granted the church of "Maybothelbeg" ("Little <a href="Maybole">Maybole</a>") and the lands of Beath ("Bethóc") to this Cistercian house. The grant is mentioned by the "Chronicle of Melrose", under the year 1193: These estates were very rich, and became attached to Melrose's "super-<a href="monastic%20grange">grange</a>" at <a href="Mauchline">Mauchline</a> in Kyle. In 1285 Melrose Abbey was able to persuade the earl of the time to force its tenants in Carrick to use the "lex Anglicana" (the "English law").

Witness to both grants were some prominent churchman connected with Melrose: magnates like Earl Donnchadh II of Fife, the latter's son <a href="Maol%20Choluim%20I%2C%20Earl%20of%20Fife">Máel Coluim</a>, <a href="Gille%20Brigte%2C%20Earl%20of%20Strathearn">Gille Brigte, Earl of Strathearn</a>, as well as probable members of Donnchadh's retinue, like Gille-Osald mac Gille-Anndrais, Gille-nan-Náemh mac Cholmain, Gille-Chríst Bretnach ("the Briton"), and Donnchadh's <a href="Chamberlain%20%28office%29">chamberlain</a> Étgar mac Muireadhaich. Áedh son of the <a href="mormaer%20of%20Lennox">mormaer of Lennox</a> also witnessed these grants, and sometime between 1208 and 1214 Donnchadh (as "Lord Donnchadh") subscribed (i.e. his name was written at the bottom, as a "witness" to) a charter of <a href="Maol%20Domhnaich%2C%20Earl%20of%20Lennox">Maol Domhnaich, Earl of Lennox</a>, son and heir of Mormaer <a href="Ail%C3%ADn%20II%2C%20Earl%20of%20Lennox">Ailean II</a>, to the bishopric of Glasgow regarding the church of <a href="Campsie%2C%20Stirlingshire">Campsie</a>.

There are records of patronage towards the nunnery of North Berwick, a house founded by Donnchadh's probable maternal grandfather or great-grandfather Donnchadh I of Fife. He gave that house the <a href="rector%20%28ecclesiastical%29">rectorship</a> of the church of <a href="St%20Cuthbert">St Cuthbert</a> of Maybole sometime between 1189 and 1250. In addition to Maybole, he gave the church of <a href="St%20Brigit">St Brigit</a> at Kirkbride to the nuns, as well as a grant of three marks from a place called "Barrebeth". Relations with the bishop of Glasgow, within whose diocese Carrick lay, are also attested. For instance, on 21 July 1225, at <a href="Ayr">Ayr</a> in Kyle, Donnchadh made a promise of <a href="tithe">tithe</a>s to <a href="Walter%20Capellanus">Walter</a>, Bishop of Glasgow.
Donnchadh's most important long-term patronage was a series of gifts to the Cluniac <a href="Abbey%20of%20Paisley">Abbey of Paisley</a> that led to the foundation of a monastery at <a href="Crossraguel">Crossraguel</a> ("Crois Riaghail"). At some date before 1227 he granted Crossraguel and a place called "Suthblan" to Paisley, a grant confirmed by <a href="Pope%20Honorius%20III">Pope Honorius III</a> on 23 January 1227. A royal confirmation by <a href="Alexander%20III%20of%20Scotland">King Alexander III of Scotland</a> dated to 25 August 1236 shows that Donnchadh granted the monastery the churches of Kirkoswald (Turnberry), Straiton and Dalquharran (Old <a href="Dailly">Dailly</a>). He may also have given the churches of <a href="Girvan">Girvan</a> and Kirkcudbright-Innertig (<a href="Ballantrae">Ballantrae</a>).

It is clear from several sources that Donnchadh made these grants on the condition that the Abbey of Paisley established a Cluniac house in Carrick, but that the Abbey did not fulfil this condition, arguing that it was not obliged to do so. The Bishop of Glasgow intervened in 1244 and determined that a house of Cluniac monks from Paisley should indeed be founded there, that the house should be exempt from the jurisdiction of Paisley save recognition of the common Cluniac Order, but that the Abbot of Paisley could visit the house annually. After the foundation Paisley was to hand over its Carrick properties to the newly established monastery.

A <a href="papal%20bull">papal bull</a> of 11 July 1265 reveals that Paisley Abbey built only a small <a href="oratory%20%28worship%29">oratory</a> served by Paisley monks. Twenty years after the bishop's ruling Paisley complained to the papacy, which led <a href="Pope%20Clement%20IV">Pope Clement IV</a> to issue two bulls, dated 11 June 1265 and 6 February 1266, appointing mandatories to settle the dispute; the results of their deliberations are unknown. Crossraguel was not finally founded until about two decades after Donnchadh's death, probably by 1270; its first abbot, Abbot Patrick, is attested between 1274 and 1292.

In secular affairs one of the few important facts recorded about Donnchadh was his marriage to Avelina, daughter of Alan fitz Walter, lord of Strathgryfe and [northern] Kyle, and <a href="High%20Steward%20of%20Scotland">High Steward of Scotland</a>. The marriage is known from Roger of Hoveden's "Chronica", which recorded that in 1200 Donnchadh: The marriage bound Donnchadh closer to the Anglo-French circles of the northern part of the region south of the Forth, while from Alan's point of view it was part of a series of moves to expand his territory further into former Gall-Gaidhil lands, moves that had included an alliance a few years earlier with another Firth of Clyde Gaelic prince, <a href="Raghnall%20mac%20Somhairle">Raghnall mac Somhairle</a> (Rǫgnvaldr, son of Sumarliði or Somerled).

Charter evidence reveals two Anglo-Normans present in Donnchadh's territory. Some of Donnchadh's charters to Melrose were subscribed by an Anglo-Norman knight named Roger de Skelbrooke, who appears to have been Lord of <a href="Greenan%20Castle">Greenan</a>. De Skelbrooke himself made grants to Melrose regarding the land of "Drumeceisuiene" (i.e. <a href="Drumshang">Drumshang</a>), grants confirmed by "his lord" Donnchadh. This knight gave Melrose fishing rights in the river Doon, rights confirmed by Donnchadh too and later by Roger's son-in-law and successor Ruaidhri mac Gille-Escoib ("Raderic mac Gillescop").

The other known Anglo-French knight was Thomas de Colville. Thomas (nicknamed "the Scot") was the younger son of the lord of <a href="Castle%20Bytham">Castle Bytham</a>, a significant landowner in <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> and <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a> Around 1190 he was constable of <a href="Dumfries">Dumfries</a>, the royal castle which had been planted in Strathnith by the Scottish king, probably overrun by the Gall-Gaidhil in the revolt of 1174 before being restored afterwards. Evidence that he possessed land in the region under Donnchadh's overlordship comes from the opening years of the 13th century when he made a grant of land around <a href="Dalmellington">Dalmellington</a> to the Cistercians of <a href="Vaudey%20Abbey">Vaudey Abbey</a>. Historians <a href="G.W.S.%20Barrow">G.W.S. Barrow</a> and <a href="Hector%20MacQueen">Hector MacQueen</a> both thought that Thomas' nickname "the Scot" (which then could mean "a Gael" as well as someone from north of the Forth), is a reflection of Thomas' exposure to the culture of the south-west during his career there.

It is not known how these two men acquired the patronage of Donnchadh or his family. Writing in 1980, Barrow could find no cause for their presence in the area, and declared that they were "for the present impossible to account for". As Richard Oram pointed out, in one of his charters Roger de Skelbrooke called Donnchadh's father Gille-Brighde "my lord", indicating that Donnchadh probably inherited them in his territory. Neither of them left traceable offspring in the region, and even if they did represent for Carrick what could have been the embryonic stages of the kind of Normanisation that was taking place further east, the process was halted during Donnchadh's period as ruler. Vaudey Abbey transferred the land granted to it by Donnchadh to Melrose Abbey in 1223, because it was "useless and dangerous to them, both on account of the absence of law and order, and by reason of the insidious attacks of a barbarous people".

The Anglo-Norman <a href="John%20de%20Courcy">John de Courcy</a>, whose early life was probably spent just across the Irish Sea in <a href="Cumbria">Cumbria</a>, invaded the over-kingdom of <a href="Ulaid">Ulaid</a> in north-eastern <a href="Lordship%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a> in 1177 with the aim of conquest. After defeating the region's king Ruaidhrí Mac Duinn Shléibhe, de Courcy was able to take control of a large amount of territory, though not without encountering further resistance among the native Irish. Cumbria was only a short distance too from the lands of the Gall-Gaidhil, and around 1180 John de Courcy married Donnchadh's cousin <a href="Affrica%20Gu%C3%B0r%C3%B8%C3%B0ard%C3%B3ttir">Affrica</a>, whose father <a href="Gu%C3%B0r%C3%B8%C3%B0r%20%C3%93l%C3%A1fsson">Guðrøðr</a> (Gofraidh), <a href="King%20of%20the%20Isles">King of the Isles</a>, was son of Donnchadh's aunt. Guðrøðr, who was thus Donnchadh's cousin, had in turn married a daughter of the <a href="Meic%20Lochlainn">Meic Lochlainn</a> ruler of <a href="Tir%20Eoghain">Tir Eoghain</a>, another Irish kingdom. Marriage thus connected Donnchadh and the other Gall-Gaidhil princes to several players in <a href="Ulster%23History">Ulster</a> affairs.

The earliest information on Donnchadh's and indeed Gall-Gaidhil involvement in Ulster comes from Roger of Hoveden's entry about the death of Jordan de Courcy, John's brother. It related that in 1197, after Jordan's death, John sought vengeance and 

Donnchadh's interests in the area were damaged when de Courcy lost his territory in eastern Ulster to his rival <a href="Hugh%20de%20Lacy%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Ulster">Hugh de Lacy</a> in 1203. John de Courcy, with help from his wife's brother King <a href="R%C7%ABgnvaldr%20Gu%C3%B0r%C3%B8%C3%B0arson">Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson</a> (Raghnall mac Gofraidh) and perhaps from Donnchadh, tried to regain his principality, but was initially unsuccessful. De Courcy's fortunes were boosted when <a href="Hugh%20de%20Lacy%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Ulster">Hugh de Lacy</a> (then <a href="Earl%20of%20Ulster">Earl of Ulster</a>) and his associate <a href="William%20de%20Braose%2C%204th%20Lord%20of%20Bramber">William III de Briouze</a>, themselves fell foul of John; the king campaigned in Ireland against them in 1210, a campaign that forced de Briouze to return to Wales and de Lacy to flee to <a href="St%20Andrews">St Andrews</a> in Scotland.

English records attest to Donnchadh's continued involvement in Ireland. One document, after describing how William de Briouze became the king's enemy in England and Ireland, records that after John arrived in Ireland in July 1210: The "Histoire des Ducs de Normandie" recorded that William and Matilda had voyaged to the Isle of Man, en route from Ireland to Galloway, where they were captured. Matilda was imprisoned by the king, and died of starvation.

Another document, this one preserved in an Irish <a href="memoranda%20roll">memoranda roll</a> dating to the reign of <a href="Henry%20VI%20of%20England">King Henry VI</a> (reigned 1422–1461), records that after John's Irish expedition of 1210, Donnchadh controlled extensive territory in <a href="County%20Antrim">County Antrim</a>, namely the settlements of <a href="Larne">Larne</a> and <a href="Glenarm">Glenarm</a> with 50 <a href="carucate">carucate</a>s of land in between, a territory similar to the later barony of <a href="Glenarm%20Upper">Glenarm Upper</a>. King John had given or recognised Donnchadh's possession of this territory, and that of Donnchadh's nephew Alaxandair (Alexander), as a reward for his help; similarly, John had given Donnchadh's cousins <a href="Alan%20of%20Galloway">Ailean</a> and Tómas, sons of Lochlann, a huge lordship equivalent to 140 <a href="knight%27s%20fee">knight's fee</a>s that included most of northern County Antrim and <a href="County%20Londonderry">County Londonderry</a>, the reward for use of their soldiers and <a href="galley">galley</a>s.

By 1219 Donnchadh and his nephew appear to have lost all or most of his Irish land; a document of that year related that the <a href="Justiciar%20of%20Ireland">Justiciar of Ireland</a>, Geoffrey de Marisco, had dispossessed ("<a href="disseisin">disseised</a>") them believing they had conspired against the king in the rebellion of 1215–6. The king, John's successor <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">Henry III</a>, found that this was not true and ordered the Justiciar to restore Donnchadh and his nephew to their lands. By 1224, Donnchadh had still not regained these lands and de Lacy's adherents were gaining more ground in the region. King Henry III repeated his earlier but ineffective instructions: he ordered <a href="Henry%20de%20Loundres">Henry de Loundres</a>, <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Dublin%20%28Roman%20Catholic%29">Archbishop of Dublin</a> and new Justiciar of Ireland, to restore to Donnchadh "the remaining part of the land given to him by King John in Ireland, unless anyone held it by his father's own precept".

Later in the same year Donnchadh wrote to King Henry. His letter was as follows: Henry's response was a <a href="writ">writ</a> to his Justiciar:

Donnchadh was said by the "Martyrology of Glasgow" to have died on 13 June 1250. He was succeeded in the earldom by <a href="Niall%20of%20Carrick">Niall</a>. The traditional view, going back to the 19th century, is that Niall was Donnchadh's son. This view has been undermined with more recent research by genealogist Andrew MacEwen, who has argued that Niall was not the son of Donnchadh, but rather his grandson, a view embraced by leading Scottish medievalist Professor G.W.S. Barrow. According to this argument, Donnchadh's son and intended heir was <a href="Cailean%20mac%20Donnchaidh">Cailean mac Donnchaidh</a> (alias "Nicholaus"), who as his son and heir, issued a charter in Donnchadh's lifetime, but seemingly predeceased him. It was further suggested that Cailean's wife, Earl Niall's mother, was a daughter of the <a href="Tir%20Eoghain">Tir Eoghain</a> king Niall Ruadh Ó Neill, tying in with Donnchadh's Irish activities, accounting for the use of the name Niall, and explaining the strong alliance with the Ó Neill held by Niall's grandsons.

Another of Donnchadh's sons, Eóin (John), owned the land of Straiton. He was involved in the Galwegian revolt of <a href="Gille%20Ruadh">Gille Ruadh</a> in 1235, during which he attacked some churches in the <a href="diocese%20of%20Glasgow">diocese of Glasgow</a>. He received a pardon by granting patronage of the church of Straiton and the land of "Hachinclohyn" to <a href="William%20de%20Bondington">William de Bondington</a>, Bishop of Glasgow, which was confirmed by Alexander II in 1244. Two other sons, Ailean (Alan) and Alaxandair (Alexander), are attested subscribing to Donnchadh and Cailean's charters to North Berwick. A Melrose charter mentions that Ailean was <a href="parson">parson</a> of "Kirchemanen". Cailean, and presumably Donnchadh's other legitimate sons, died before their father.

Donnchadh's probable grandson, Niall, was earl for only six years and died leaving no son but four daughters, one of whom is known by name. The last, presumably the eldest, was his successor <a href="Marjorie%2C%20Countess%20of%20Carrick">Marjorie</a>, who married in turn <a href="Adam%20of%20Kilconquhar">Adam of Kilconquhar</a> (died 1271), a member of the <a href="Mac%20Duibh">Mac Duibh</a> family of Fife, and <a href="Robert%20de%20Brus%2C%206th%20Lord%20of%20Annandale">Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale</a>. Marjorie's son <a href="Robert%20the%20Bruce">Robert the Bruce</a>, through military success and ancestral kinship with the <a href="Dunkeld%20dynasty">Dunkeld dynasty</a>, became King of Scots. King Robert's brother, <a href="Edward%20Bruce">Edward Bruce</a>, became for a short time <a href="High%20King%20of%20Ireland">High King of Ireland</a>.

Under the Bruces and their successors to the Scottish throne the title Earl of Carrick became a prestigious honorific title usually given to a son of the king or intended heir; at some time between 1250 and 1256 Earl Niall, anticipating that the earldom would be taken over by a man from another family, issued a charter to Lochlann ("Roland") of Carrick, a son or grandson of one of Donnchadh's brothers. The charter granted Lochlann the title "Cenn Cineoil", "head of the kindred", a position which brought the right to lead the men of Carrick in war. The charter also conferred possession of the office of baillie of Carrick under whoever was earl. Precedent had been established here by other native families of Scotland, something similar having already taken place in Fife; it was a way of ensuring that the kin-group retained strong locally based male leadership even when the newly imposed common law of Scotland forced the comital title to pass into the hands of another family. By 1372 the office had passed—probably by marriage—to the <a href="Marquess%20of%20Ailsa">Kennedy family of Dunure</a>.

The 17th-century genealogical compilation known as "<a href="Ane%20Accompt%20of%20the%20Genealogie%20of%20the%20Campbells">Ane Accompt of the Genealogie of the Campbells</a>" by Robert Duncanson, minister of <a href="Campbeltown">Campbeltown</a>, claimed that "Efferic" (i.e. Affraic or Afraig), wife of <a href="Gilleasbaig%20of%20Menstrie">Gilleasbaig of Menstrie</a> (<a href="floruit">fl.</a> 1263–6) and mother of Campbell progenitor <a href="Cailean%20M%C3%B3r">Cailean Mór</a>, was the daughter of one Cailean (anglicised "Colin"), "Lord of Carrick". Partly because "Ane Accompt" is a credible witness to much earlier material, the claim is thought probable. Thus Donnchadh was likely the great-grandfather of Cailean Mór, a lineage that explains the popularity of the names Donnchadh (Duncan) and Cailean (Colin) among later Campbells, as well as their close alliance to King Robert I during the <a href="Scottish%20Wars%20of%20Independence">Scottish Wars of Independence</a>.

Song of Innocence

Song of Innocence is the debut studio album by American composer and producer <a href="David%20Axelrod%20%28musician%29">David Axelrod</a>. It was released in October 1968 by <a href="Capitol%20Records">Capitol Records</a>. 

Axelrod sought to capitalize on the experimental climate of popular music and composed the album as a <a href="suite%20%28music%29">suite</a>-like <a href="tone%20poem">tone poem</a> based on "<a href="Songs%20of%20Innocence%20and%20of%20Experience">Songs of Innocence</a>", a 1789 illustrated collection of poems by <a href="William%20Blake">William Blake</a>. He recorded the album at <a href="Capitol%20Studios">Capitol Studios</a> in Los Angeles with an orchestra and studio musicians from <a href="The%20Wrecking%20Crew%20%28music%29">the Wrecking Crew</a> collective, including keyboardist and conductor <a href="Don%20Randi">Don Randi</a>, guitarist <a href="Al%20Casey%20%28rock%20%26amp%3B%20roll%20guitarist%29">Al Casey</a>, bassist <a href="Carol%20Kaye">Carol Kaye</a>, and drummer <a href="Earl%20Palmer">Earl Palmer</a>.

"Song of Innocence" is an instrumental <a href="jazz%20fusion">jazz fusion</a> record that incorporates elements of <a href="classical%20music">classical</a>, <a href="rock%20music">rock</a>, <a href="funk">funk</a>, <a href="pop%20music">pop</a>, and <a href="theatre%20music">theatre music</a>. It is <a href="arrangement">arranged</a> for bass, drums, and string instruments, written in the rock <a href="instrumental%20idiom">idiom</a> with <a href="tempo">tempo</a>s centered on rock-based patterns by Palmer. Axelrod used <a href="contrast%20%28music%29">contrast</a> in his orchestral compositions and interspersed the album's euphoric <a href="psychedelic%20soul">psychedelic R&B</a> <a href="musical%20form">form</a> with dramatic, harrowing arrangements to reflect the supernatural themes found in Blake's poems. The music's reverent, psychedelic overtones evoke the poet's themes of innocence and spirituality.

Although "Song of Innocence" was innovative for its application of rock and jazz techniques, it was not commercially successful and confounded contemporary critics, who viewed it as an ambitious curiosity piece. In the 1990s, critics reassessed the album as a classic, while leading disc jockeys in <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a> and <a href="electronica">electronica</a> rediscovered and <a href="sampling%20%28music%29">sampled</a> the album's music. "Holy Thursday", the record's best-known song, was frequently sampled by hip hop producers. The renewed interest in Axelrod's work prompted <a href="Stateside%20Records">Stateside Records</a> to reissue "Song of Innocence" in 2000.

In the 1960s, Axelrod worked as a producer and <a href="artists%20and%20repertoire">A&R</a> executive for <a href="Capitol%20Records">Capitol Records</a> in Los Angeles. During this time, he began to conceive his own musical ideas, involving a fusion of baroque classical sounds, <a href="rhythm%20and%20blues">R&B</a> rhythms, and spiritual themes. Challenged by what he described as a "new breed of record buyer ... more sophisticated in his thinking", he was one of several Los Angeles-based musical eccentrics during the late 1960s who wanted to expand on the mid-1960s studio experiments of <a href="Brian%20Wilson">Brian Wilson</a> and <a href="George%20Martin">George Martin</a>. His first attempt at this creative vision was composing a religious-themed, psychedelic opera for <a href="the%20Electric%20Prunes">the Electric Prunes</a>, a local <a href="garage%20rock">garage rock</a> group. When the band found it too challenging to finish the recording, Axelrod enlisted studio musicians from <a href="the%20Wrecking%20Crew%20%28music%29">the Wrecking Crew</a> to complete the album, released as "<a href="Mass%20in%20F%20Minor">Mass in F Minor</a>" in 1968. The recording attracted both controversy and national fame for the producer.

After the success of "Mass in F Minor", Axelrod was asked by Capitol to record a similar album. He wanted to further capitalize on the experimental climate of <a href="popular%20music">popular music</a> and chose to adapt works by English poet <a href="William%20Blake">William Blake</a> on an album. Blake musical settings were at the height of their popularity among musicians and composers. Numerous <a href="art%20music">serious music</a> composers had set his poems to music since the 1870s, and the practice was eventually adapted in other musical fields during the 20th century, including popular music, <a href="musical%20theatre">musical theatre</a>, and the 1960s <a href="American%20folk%20music%20revival">folk</a> <a href="instrumental%20idiom">idiom</a>. Axelrod, a self-professed "Blake freak", had been fascinated by Blake's painting and poetry since his late teens and frequently read the poems as an adult. He conceived "Song of Innocence" after he had bought an edition of Blake's complete poetry while working in Capitol's art department and considered the concept for a few years before "Mass in F Minor". Axelrod was not sociable with colleagues, such as record executives who could have helped him professionally, and felt that he could identify with Blake; he considered the poet "very bad at making new friends".

Axelrod composed "Song of Innocence" in one week and began recording in mid-1968. He recorded the album at <a href="Capitol%20Studios">Capitol Studios</a> in Los Angeles with his close-knit group of veteran studio musicians from the Wrecking Crew, including keyboardist and conductor <a href="Don%20Randi">Don Randi</a>, guitarist <a href="Al%20Casey%20%28rock%20%26amp%3B%20roll%20guitarist%29">Al Casey</a>, bassist <a href="Carol%20Kaye">Carol Kaye</a>, and drummer <a href="Earl%20Palmer">Earl Palmer</a>. He had worked with them before when producing sessions for Capitol recording artists. 

Axelrod did not play any instruments on "Song of Innocence"; he instead wrote arrangements for his orchestra and utilized 33 players to perform his <a href="Chord%20chart">notated charts</a>. He had learned how to read and orchestrate complex music charts from <a href="jazz">jazz</a> musicians during the 1950s. Randi conducted the orchestra and played both piano and <a href="organ%20%28music%29">organ</a> on the record. Axelrod preferred listening to a session from a recording booth like his contemporary <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Igor Stravinsky</a>. "That way the sounds don't seem to go all over the place", he later said. "Music seems so small in a studio." Axelrod originally wanted some of the album's compositions to feature a large-scale <a href="choir">choir</a> but was uncertain if he could find the appropriate ensemble, so he recorded an entirely instrumental album and included one Blake setting for each <a href="Section%20%28music%29">section</a> of the <a href="sheet%20music">score</a>.

A <a href="jazz%20fusion">jazz fusion</a> album, "Song of Innocence" combines jazz elements with <a href="Impressionist%20music">impressionistic</a> musical <a href="figure%20%28music%29">figures</a> and <a href="hard%20rock">hard rock</a> guitar <a href="solo%20%28music%29">solos</a>. Its music also incorporates <a href="funk">funk</a>, <a href="rock%20music">rock</a>, <a href="theatre%20music">theatre</a>, and <a href="pop%20music">pop</a> styles. Music journalists categorized the record as <a href="jazz-rock">jazz-rock</a>, <a href="baroque%20pop">baroque pop</a>, and <a href="psychedelic%20soul">psychedelic R&B</a>. John Murph of "<a href="JazzTimes">JazzTimes</a>" magazine said the music could be better characterized as <a href="art%20pop">art pop</a> than jazz. Axelrod, who had produced <a href="bebop">bebop</a> albums before working for Capitol, asserted that jazz played a crucial role in the music: "For years, all I did was jazz. When I first got in the record business, I was so into jazz that I had never heard <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a>. I still probably listen to jazz more than anything else."

Axelrod composed the album as a <a href="Symphonic%20poem">tone poem</a> suite based on Blake's illustrated 1789 collection of poems "<a href="Songs%20of%20Innocence%20and%20of%20Experience">Songs of Innocence</a>". His compositions borrowed titles from Blake's poems, which dealt with themes such as <a href="Vision%20%28spirituality%29">visions</a>, religious iniquity, <a href="rite%20of%20passage">rite of passage</a>, and life experience after a person's birth and innocence. Mary Campbell of "<a href="The%20Baltimore%20Sun">The Baltimore Sun</a>" said the classical and Christian <a href="church%20music">church music</a> elements made the record sound "reverent, as if describing a biblical story". "<a href="Les%20Inrockuptibles">Les Inrockuptibles</a>" described it as a "<a href="Psyche%20%28psychology%29">psyche</a>-<a href="liturgy">liturgical</a>" work dedicated to Blake. According to <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>'s Thom Jurek, <a href="psychedelia">psychedelia</a> was implicit in the record's <a href="musical%20form">musical form</a> and feeling, which impelled Axelrod to "celebrate the wildness and folly of youth with celebration and verve".
The album's music was written in the rock idiom and arranged for bass, drums, and strings. As a composer, Axelrod abandoned the conventional unison approach to orchestral writing in favor of more <a href="contrast%20%28music%29">contrasts</a> while centering his <a href="tempo">tempo</a>s around rock-based drum patterns played mostly in <a href="common%20time">common time</a> by Palmer. He utilized his instrumental ensemble as a <a href="symphonic%20rock">rock orchestra</a>, playing melodramatic strings and pronounced, echo-laden <a href="breakbeat">breakbeat</a>s. The music was also embellished with <a href="electric%20piano">electric piano</a>, intricate <a href="bassline">bassline</a>s, <a href="Echoplex">Echoplex</a> effects, and elements of suspense Axelrod used to reflect the supernatural themes found in Blake's poems. According to David N. Howard, the album's "euphorically" upbeat psychedelic R&B form was interspersed by "dramatically sparse" and "harrowing" arrangements.

Axelrod and his musicians used key musical <a href="phrase%20%28music%29">phrases</a> that are expanded upon throughout "Song of Innocence". He was interested in <a href="Gy%C3%B6rgy%20Ligeti">György Ligeti</a>'s 1961 piece "<a href="Atmosph%C3%A8res">Atmosphères</a>" and <a href="Lukas%20Foss">Lukas Foss</a>' idea of starting a piece with a <a href="added%20tone%20chord">sustained chord</a>, having musicians improvise over 100 <a href="bar%20%28music%29">bars</a>, and ending with another chord as they finish. "Urizen" opened with long sustained chords, <a href="sound%20effect">sound effect</a>s, <a href="reverberation">reverb</a>ed guitar <a href="Stab%20%28music%29">stab</a>s, and a supple bassline. On "Holy Thursday", the <a href="rhythm%20section">rhythm section</a> played a slow, jazzed-out <a href="groove%20%28music%29">groove</a> and <a href="blues">blues</a>y bop piano lines, as a <a href="big%20band">big band</a> <a href="vamp%20%28music%29">vamp</a> was played by a large-scale <a href="string%20section">string section</a>. In response to their <a href="Swing%20%28jazz%20performance%20style%29">swing style</a>, the <a href="brass%20section">brass section</a> and guitarists played dramatic, high-pitched overtones built around a complex <a href="melody">melody</a>. The middle of the album featured more traditional jazz passages and the presence of a psychedelic <a href="harpsichord">harpsichord</a>. "The Smile" was recorded with a rhythmic drum beat, offbeat bass, and a progressive string part. For the songs near the end, the musicians steadily transitioned to heady psychedelia featuring gritty guitars and disorienting organ <a href="lick%20%28music%29">licks</a>. On "The Mental Traveler", Axelrod said he tried to experiment with <a href="atonality">atonality</a> but "chickened out".

"Song of Innocence" was released in October 1968 by Capitol Records. "<a href="Stereo%20Review">Stereo Review</a>" magazine's Paul Kresh appraised the album negatively in 1969, finding it pretentious and inadequate; dependent on <a href="movie%20music">movie music</a> tricks and outdated techniques such as forced climaxes and gaudy orchestration. He said it fell severely short of the concept Axelrod aspired to and that "only the most uneducated will be taken in by the mountains of misterioso claptrap that surround these squeaking musical mice". Nat Freedland from "Entertainment World" accused Axelrod of "indulging himself here to little avail". Writing for "<a href="Gramophone%20%28magazine%29">Gramophone</a>", Nigel Hunter found the songs to be "of absorbing power and depth", but complained of the electric guitar parts.

Other critics were more enthusiastic. <a href="Alasdair%20Clayre">Alasdair Clayre</a>, also from "Gramophone", questioned whether the "occasional guitar gobbling" reflected Axelrod's genuine ideas or "an obligatory concession to contemporary sound", but he ultimately regarded it as a compelling record. In his opinion, the producer's impressions of Blake "reveal a depth of imagination and skill warranting attention beyond the confines of pop music", proving he could compose innovative pieces for a large orchestra, which Clayre felt comprised the best of California's studio musicians on the album. "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" magazine called it "an aesthetic mix of music and philosophy ... chock full of <a href="mysticism">mysticism</a>, creativity, and change", believing that Axelrod's idyllic music would be interesting enough to impact the <a href="record%20chart">record chart</a>s.

"Song of Innocence" received radio exposure on both <a href="AM%20broadcasting">AM</a> and <a href="FM%20broadcasting">FM</a> stations with songs such as the title track and "Holy Thursday", which became the album's best-known recording. The album was not a commercial success and only sold 75,000 copies by October 1969.

"Song of Innocence" was one of many <a href="concept%20album">concept album</a>s recorded as rock music was developing in various directions during the late 1960s, following in the wake of <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a>' 1967 album "<a href="Sgt.%20Pepper%27s%20Lonely%20Hearts%20Club%20Band">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a>". It was innovative for its original application of both rock and jazz <a href="Musical%20technique">techniques</a>. According to music journalist Zaid Mudhaffer, the term "jazz fusion" was coined in a review of the record when it was released. Axelrod followed the album up in 1969 with the similarly Blake-inspired "<a href="Songs%20of%20Experience%20%28David%20Axelrod%20album%29">Songs of Experience</a>", which adapted <a href="Gunther%20Schuller">Gunther Schuller</a>'s <a href="third%20stream">third stream</a> concept to baroque orchestrations and rock, pop, and R&B rhythms and melodies. Both albums established Axelrod as an unpredictable, challenging <a href="conceptual%20art">conceptual art</a>ist. His instrumental interpretations of Blake were the first in jazz, followed in 1971 by <a href="Rafa%C5%82%20Augustyn%20%28composer%29">Rafał Augustyn</a>'s "Niewinność" and <a href="Adrian%20Mitchell">Adrian Mitchell</a>'s musical "Tyger: A Celebration of William Blake" with composer <a href="Mike%20Westbrook">Mike Westbrook</a>; Westbrook later composed more Blake-inspired works, including "The Westbrook Blake: "Bright as Fire"" (1980).

During the late 1990s, Axelrod's records were reassessed and considered innovative by critics, including "Song of Innocence", which was regarded as a classic. "<a href="Mojo%20%28magazine%29">Mojo</a>" cited it as "the heart of Axelrod's legacy", while John Mulvey from "<a href="NME">NME</a>" called it "sky-kissingly high and divine", finding Axelrod versatile enough to "soar above his own pretensions", Writing for AllMusic, John Bush said the album "sounded like nothing else from its era", while Thom Jurek argued that it continued to sound new upon each listen due to a lack of "cynicism and hipper-than-thou posturing" in the music. In a four-and-a-half star retrospective review, Jurek said it was innovative in 1968 and still "withstands the test of time better than the Beatles "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" album that allegedly inspired it". Giving it a five-out-of-five score, "<a href="Tiny%20Mix%20Tapes">Tiny Mix Tapes</a>" said it sounded engagingly magnificent and diverse, citing it as one of the most dynamic musical fusions and "one of the most unique and thought provoking musical efforts of the last several decades".

Axelrod's music was also rediscovered and <a href="sampling%20%28music%29">sampled</a> by leading <a href="disc%20jockey">disc jockey</a>s in the 1990s including <a href="hip%20hop%20production">hip hop producers</a>. When sampling in hip hop peaked during the early and mid-1990s, they searched for archived records with atmospheric beats and strings to sample. Los Angeles-based disc jockey B+ recalled finding a copy of "Song of Innocence" at a <a href="Goodwill%20Industries">Goodwill</a> in <a href="Culver%20City">Culver City</a> and said it appealed to him because of its <a href="consonance%20and%20dissonance">dissonant</a> quality, musical <a href="dynamics%20%28music%29">dynamics</a>, and string sound: "This big sound. It was like somehow [Axelrod] was summoning the future, that you can project this environment, this moment into the future." <a href="Electronica">Electronica</a> pioneers such as <a href="DJ%20Cam">DJ Cam</a> and <a href="DJ%20Shadow">DJ Shadow</a> also sampled "Song of Innocence". The latter producer sampled the record's choral themes and piano motifs on his influential debut album "<a href="Endtroducing...">Endtroducing...</a>" (1996). "The Smile" was sampled by <a href="Pete%20Rock">Pete Rock</a> on his 1998 song "Strange Fruit" and by <a href="DJ%20Premier">DJ Premier</a> on <a href="Royce%20da%205%279%26quot%3B">Royce da 5'9"</a>'s 2009 song "Shake This". "Holy Thursday" was frequently sampled by producers, including <a href="The%20Beatnuts">The Beatnuts</a> on their 1994 song "<a href="Hit%20Me%20with%20That">Hit Me with That</a>", <a href="UNKLE">UNKLE</a> on their 1998 song "<a href="Rabbit%20in%20Your%20Headlights">Rabbit in Your Headlights</a>", and <a href="Swizz%20Beatz">Swizz Beatz</a> on <a href="Lil%20Wayne">Lil Wayne</a>'s 2008 song "Dr. Carter".

The renewed interest in Axelrod's work prompted <a href="Stateside%20Records">Stateside Records</a> to <a href="reissue">reissue</a> "Song of Innocence" in 2000. Reviewing the re-release, "<a href="Now%20%28newspaper%29">Now</a>" wrote that after sounding odd during the 1960s, the songs had become "a sampler's dream come true – who knew?" <a href="David%20Keenan">David Keenan</a> attributed Axelrod's sampling legacy to "the original badass drummer" Palmer. In his appraisal for "<a href="The%20Wire%20%28magazine%29">The Wire</a>", he facetiously critiqued that the songs "may reek of stale <a href="joss%20stick">joss stick</a>s and <a href="patchouli">patchouli</a>-scented <a href="self-actualisation">self-actualisation</a>, but in their very datedness they somehow sound very modern." "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>" journalist Sean Fennessey later said Axelrod's first two records were "essential if only as a tour guide through early 90s hip-hop", having "literally been a rap producer's delight for years". In a 2013 list for "<a href="Complex%20%28magazine%29">Complex</a>", DJ and production duo Kon and Amir named "Holy Thursday" the greatest hip hop sample of all time. In 2018, "Song of Innocence" was given another re-release, this time by Now-Again Records. It featured a new <a href="remaster">remaster</a> by Randi, <a href="H.%20B.%20Barnum">H. B. Barnum</a>, and Axelrod's widow, Terri; and <a href="sleeve%20notes">sleeve notes</a> written by Eothen Alapat, Now-Again's CEO. According to Alapat's notes, Axelrod once told him that <a href="Miles%20Davis">Miles Davis</a> played the album before conceiving his own fusion of jazz and rock for "<a href="Bitches%20Brew">Bitches Brew</a>" (1970).

All songs were written, arranged, and produced by <a href="David%20Axelrod%20%28musician%29">David Axelrod</a>.

Half-Life 2: Lost Coast

Half-Life 2: Lost Coast (stylized as HλLF-LIFE: LOST COAST) is an additional <a href="Level%20%28video%20gaming%29">level</a> for the 2004 <a href="first-person%20shooter">first-person shooter</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> "<a href="Half-Life%202">Half-Life 2</a>". Developed by <a href="Valve%20Corporation">Valve Corporation</a>, it was released on October 27, 2005, through the <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a> content delivery service as a free download to owners of the <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> version of "Half-Life 2". "Lost Coast" serves as a <a href="tech%20demo">technology demonstration</a>, specifically showcasing the <a href="high-dynamic-range%20rendering">high-dynamic-range rendering</a> implemented in the <a href="Source%20%28game%20engine%29">Source engine</a>. The level was designed with a variety of appropriate environments to emphasize these effects. In addition, "Lost Coast" was the first video game developed by Valve to allow developers to explain various elements of design as the player progresses through the level.

"Lost Coast" follows "Half-Life" protagonist <a href="Gordon%20Freeman">Gordon Freeman</a> as he travels up a coastal cliff to destroy a <a href="Combine%20%28Half-Life%29">Combine</a> headcrab artillery launcher in a monastery, which is firing on a nearby town, Saint Olga. The "Lost Coast" level was originally created for "Half-Life 2", but was ultimately removed from the game. As a result, it has several minor story details that were not included in "Half-Life 2". The level received a generally positive reception, and there was consensus among reviewers that the new features included in "Lost Coast" should be integrated into future games released by Valve.

"Lost Coast" uses the same <a href="first-person%20shooter">first-person shooter</a> gameplay mechanics as "Half-Life 2". The game is viewed from the perspective of the <a href="player%20character">player character</a>, and plot information is imparted through scripted sequences rather than <a href="cutscene">cutscene</a>s. A <a href="heads-up%20display">heads-up display</a> at the bottom of the screen shows the player's <a href="Health%20%28game%20mechanic%29">health</a>, energy gauge, and ammunition status, while available weapons are shown at the top. Health and armor energy can be replenished by picking up medical supplies and energy cells respectively, or by using wall-mounted charging devices. The player character is equipped with a small armory of weapons from "Half-Life 2" at the beginning of the level, including a pistol, shotgun, crossbow, and <a href="gravity%20gun">gravity gun</a>. The gravity gun allows the player to manipulate physical objects in the world; it can be used to pick up nearby objects and throw them at enemies or create cover from enemy fire. The gravity gun can also be used to perform several non-combat functions, such as grabbing out-of-reach supply crates.

"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast" opens with the protagonist, <a href="Gordon%20Freeman">Gordon Freeman</a>, finding himself near a group of decaying piers, underneath a <a href="monastery">monastery</a> set up on rocks and overlooking the small town of <a href="Olga%20of%20Kiev">St. Olga</a>. A fisherman recognizes Gordon and directs him to the monastery, which the enemy <a href="Combine%20%28Half-Life%29">Combine</a> are using as a platform to launch artillery shells filled with <a href="headcrab">headcrab</a>s into the town. The fisherman opens a gate, allowing the player to proceed, and awaits Gordon's return.

As Gordon proceeds up the cliffside to the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Byzantine Christian</a> monastery, he encounters heavy resistance from Combine soldiers who rappel down the cliff to try to stop him. Gordon fights his way up, enters the church's <a href="nave">nave</a>, and disables the artillery launcher. This alerts nearby soldiers, who assault the sanctuary in force, while a Combine <a href="attack%20helicopter">attack helicopter</a> arrives to support the soldiers. After defeating the soldiers in the courtyard, Gordon moves to scaffolding over the side of the cliff and destroys the helicopter with <a href="rocket-propelled%20grenade">RPGs</a>. The helicopter crashes into the scaffolding, freeing up a path to a crude elevator which lowers Gordon back down to the pier. The fisherman congratulates Freeman on his success, invites him to a feast in St. Olga, and the screen fades out. As the level ends, the fisherman exclaims that Gordon is "getting all fuzzy 'round the edges".

"Lost Coast" was conceived as a part of the Highway 17 chapter in "Half-Life 2" (Highway 17's development name was "Coast", hence the name "Lost Coast"), but was later discarded during development. As a result, "Lost Coast" features minor storyline details that were removed from "Half-Life 2", such as the headcrab artillery launchers. Each area of the level was designed with a specific purpose. An <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20church%20architecture">Eastern Orthodox architectural style</a> was deliberately chosen for the monastery, as buildings of this type "are very colorful and have a large variety of materials" and are "often lit naturally, with extremes of darkness and brightness," providing an ideal showcase for the HDR lighting effects. Valve also thought that the use of a monastery would help provide a starker contrast between old human architecture and futuristic Combine technology found within it. The cliffside that leads to the monastery had a gameplay-oriented purpose, and was meant to emulate a similar cliffside combat scene in "<a href="Half-Life%20%28video%20game%29">Half-Life</a>". The cliffside also forces the player to be observant of threats from above and below, breaking from normal horizontal combat. The monastery's courtyard was designed as an area where the player recovers from the cliffside combat, while also presenting a contained combat arena later in the level in which the player must hold their ground while they are attacked from multiple directions.

The goal of "Lost Coast" was to demonstrate the new <a href="high-dynamic-range%20rendering">high-dynamic-range rendering</a> implemented into the <a href="Source%20%28game%20engine%29">Source game engine</a>. Valve first attempted to implement high-dynamic-range rendering in Source in late 2003. The first method stored textures in <a href="RGBA%20color%20space">RGBA color space</a>, allowing for <a href="multisample%20anti-aliasing">multisample anti-aliasing</a> and <a href="pixel%20shader">pixel shader</a>s to be used, but this prevented <a href="alpha%20mapping">alpha mapping</a> and fog effects from working properly, as well as making textures appear sharp and jagged. The second method involved saving two versions of a texture: one with regular data, and the other with overbrightening data. However, this technique did not allow for multisample anti-aliasing and consumed twice as much <a href="video%20card">video card</a> memory, making it infeasible. The third method, shown at the <a href="E3%20%28Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo%29">E3 convention</a> in 2005, used <a href="floating%20point">floating point</a> data to define the <a href="RGB%20color%20space">RGB color space</a>, allowing for reasonably efficient storage of the high-dynamic-range data. However, this method also did not allow for multisample anti-aliasing, and was only compatible with <a href="Nvidia">Nvidia</a> video cards, leaving <a href="ATI%20Technologies">ATI</a> cards unable to run high dynamic range. The fourth and final method compromised between the second and third methods, using overbrightening textures sparingly and allowing ATI cards to render HDR in a different way to the Nvidia ones while nearly producing the same end result.

The final version of Valve's high-dynamic-range technology adds a significant number of lighting effects to the engine, aimed at making the game appear more realistic. <a href="Bloom%20%28shader%20effect%29">Bloom shading</a> was introduced, blurring bright edges in the game world and emulating a camera's overexposure to light. This is combined with <a href="Exposure%20%28photography%29">exposure control</a> to tailor the effect to represent the <a href="human%20eye">human eye</a>. For example, as the player exits a dark area into a light area, the new area is initially glaringly bright, but quickly darkens, representing the adjustment of the player character's eyes to the light. New <a href="cube%20mapping">cube mapping</a> techniques allow the reflection cast by an object to correspond with the brightness of the light source, and <a href="lightmap">lightmap</a>s enable light bouncing and global illumination to be taken into account in the rendering. <a href="Refraction">Refraction</a> effects were added to make light account for the physical attributes of an object and to emulate the way light is reflected by water. The "Lost Coast" level is specifically designed to showcase these effects. It uses the sea and beach as opportunities to demonstrate water-based effects, the monastery to demonstrate bloom from its whitewash walls, and the sanctuary to provide the means to show refraction through stained glass windows and cube maps on golden urns and candlesticks.

As a technology showcase, Valve considered "Lost Coast" to have very demanding system requirements. The game runs on computers with specifications lower than what is recommended, albeit without some key features such as high dynamic range. If a non-high-dynamic-range-capable card is used, the developer commentary is changed slightly to reflect this. For example, Valve president <a href="Gabe%20Newell">Gabe Newell</a> would describe the effects that are seen in a different manner.

In addition to a showcase for visual improvements, "Lost Coast" acted as a testbed for Valve's commentary system. When the feature is enabled, additional items appear in the game that can be interacted with to play an audio commentary. Each audio piece ranges from ten seconds to a minute of commentary. Players hear the developers talk about what the player is seeing, what is happening, why they made certain decisions, and what kinds of challenges they faced. Commentary tracks are represented by floating speech bubbles called commentary nodes. Valve intended for players to first play the level with commentary disabled, and after completing the level, play it again with commentary enabled, learning about each new stage as they progress. The company has since made the commentary system standard in all of its later video games.

"Lost Coast" was released on October 27, 2005, as a free download from Valve's <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a> content delivery service to anyone who purchased "Half-Life 2". People who received "Half-Life 2" as a gift from Valve's online store were not eligible to download the level. Valve announced on May 30, 2007 that "Lost Coast", along with "", would be made available for free to owners of ATI <a href="Radeon">Radeon</a> cards. It was later released without charge to <a href="Nvidia">Nvidia</a> graphics card owners along with "Half-Life 2: Deathmatch", "<a href="Peggle%20Extreme">Peggle Extreme</a>", and the first eleven levels of "<a href="Portal%20%28video%20game%29">Portal</a>".

"Lost Coast" was generally well received by video game critics. <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a> enjoyed the amount of detail, including the graphics, puzzles, and intelligent enemies, saying, "Valve just packed more atmosphere into a tiny snippet than most shooters muster, period." The review also praised the level's commentary system, calling it an informative addition, and enjoyed the interesting and insightful comments made by some of its creators. The level satisfied <a href="UGO">UGO</a> because "it would be harder not to enjoy this level in all its beautifully rendered glory—even after you've broken all the windows and spattered the walls with Combine blood," and <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> commented that "the textures in Lost Coast are noticeably more detailed and numerous than in the retail game." The review concluded hoping that the features introduced in "Lost Coast" would be included in Valve's future releases.

Negative reaction to the game focused on its length and gameplay. 1UP.com and UGO both considered it short; Shawn Elliott of 1UP.com described it as "a lickety-split run through postcard-pretty tide pools, up cliffs, and into a church turned Combine outpost". UGO's Nigel Grammer stated that "Lost Coast"s gameplay seemed to be secondary to the level's graphics. "Lost Coast"s gameplay disappointed <a href="Brad%20Shoemaker">Brad Shoemaker</a> of GameSpot, who compared it to that of "<a href="Half-Life%202">Half-Life 2</a>" and considered them to be very similar, saying that it "isn't going to set the world on fire".

HMB produces these effects in part by stimulating the <a href="protein%20synthesis">production of proteins</a> and inhibiting the <a href="protein%20breakdown">breakdown of proteins</a> in muscle tissue. No <a href="adverse%20effect">adverse effect</a>s from long-term use as a dietary supplement in adults have been found.

HMB is a <a href="metabolite">metabolite</a> of <a href="leucine"></a> and is produced in the body through oxidation of the <a href="ketoacid">ketoacid</a> of (<a href="%CE%B1-ketoisocaproic%20acid">α-ketoisocaproic acid</a>). Since only a small fraction of is metabolized into HMB, <a href="pharmacologically%20active">pharmacologically active</a> concentrations of the compound in <a href="blood%20plasma">blood plasma</a> and muscle can only be achieved by supplementing HMB directly. A healthy adult produces approximately 0.3 grams of HMB per day, while supplemental HMB is usually taken in doses of  grams per day. HMB is sold as a dietary supplement at a cost of about per month when taking 3 grams per day. HMB is also contained in several nutritional products, including certain formulations of <a href="Ensure">Ensure</a>, <a href="Juven">Juven</a>, and <a href="Myoplex">Myoplex</a>. HMB is also present in insignificant quantities in certain foods, such as <a href="alfalfa">alfalfa</a>, <a href="asparagus">asparagus</a>, <a href="avocado">avocado</a>s, <a href="cauliflower">cauliflower</a>, <a href="grapefruit">grapefruit</a>, and <a href="catfish">catfish</a>.

The effects of HMB on human skeletal muscle were first discovered by Steven L. Nissen at <a href="Iowa%20State%20University">Iowa State University</a> in the . HMB has not been banned by the <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">National Collegiate Athletic Association</a>, <a href="World%20Anti-Doping%20Agency">World Anti-Doping Agency</a>, or any other prominent national or international athletic organization. In 2006, only about 2% of college <a href="student%20athlete">student athlete</a>s in the United States used HMB as a dietary supplement. As of 2017, HMB has found widespread use as an <a href="ergogenic%20supplement">ergogenic supplement</a> among young athletes.

HMB is sold as an <a href="over-the-counter">over-the-counter</a> <a href="dietary%20supplement">dietary supplement</a> in the <a href="free%20acid">free acid</a> form, "β-hydroxy β-methylbutyric acid" (HMB-FA), and as a <a href="monohydrate">monohydrate</a>d calcium <a href="salt%20%28chemistry%29">salt</a> of the <a href="conjugate%20base">conjugate base</a>, "calcium monohydrate" (HMB-Ca, CaHMB).

A healthy adult produces approximately 0.3 grams per day, while supplemental HMB is usually taken in doses of  grams per day. HMB is sold at a cost of about per month when taken in doses of 3 grams per day. HMB is also contained in several nutritional products and medical foods marketed by <a href="Abbott%20Laboratories">Abbott Laboratories</a> (e.g., certain formulations of <a href="Ensure">Ensure</a>, <a href="Juven">Juven</a>, and <a href="Myoplex">Myoplex</a>), and is present in insignificant quantities in certain foods, such as <a href="alfalfa">alfalfa</a>, <a href="asparagus">asparagus</a>, <a href="avocado">avocado</a>s, <a href="cauliflower">cauliflower</a>, <a href="grapefruit">grapefruit</a>, and <a href="catfish">catfish</a>.

Supplemental HMB has been used in <a href="clinical%20trial">clinical trial</a>s as a treatment for preserving lean body mass in muscle wasting conditions, particularly <a href="sarcopenia">sarcopenia</a>, and has been studied in clinical trials as an <a href="adjunct%20therapy">adjunct therapy</a> in conjunction with <a href="resistance%20exercise">resistance exercise</a>. Based upon two medical reviews and a <a href="meta-analysis">meta-analysis</a> of seven <a href="randomized%20controlled%20trial">randomized controlled trial</a>s, HMB supplementation can preserve or increase lean muscle mass and muscle strength in <a href="sarcopenic">sarcopenic</a> older adults. HMB does not appear to significantly affect fat mass in older adults. Preliminary clinical evidence suggests that HMB supplementation may also prevent <a href="muscle%20atrophy">muscle atrophy</a> during <a href="bed%20rest">bed rest</a>. A growing body of evidence supports the efficacy of HMB in nutritional support for reducing, or even reversing, the loss of muscle mass, <a href="Muscle%23Physiology">muscle function</a>, and <a href="Muscle%23Strength">muscle strength</a> that occurs in <a href="hypercatabolic">hypercatabolic</a> disease states such as cancer <a href="cachexia">cachexia</a>; consequently, the authors of two 2016 reviews of the clinical evidence recommended that the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia and muscle wasting in general include supplementation with HMB, regular resistance exercise, and consumption of a <a href="high-protein%20diet">high-protein diet</a>.

Clinical trials that used HMB for the treatment of muscle wasting have involved the administration of 3 grams of HMB per day under different dosing regimens. According to one review, an optimal dosing regimen is to administer it in one 1 gram dose, three times a day, since this ensures elevated plasma concentrations of HMB throughout the day; however, the best dosing regimen for muscle wasting conditions is still being investigated.

Some branded products that contain HMB (i.e., certain formulations of Ensure and Juven) are <a href="medical%20food">medical food</a>s that are intended to be used to provide nutritional support under the care of a doctor in individuals with <a href="muscle%20wasting">muscle wasting</a> due to <a href="HIV/AIDS">HIV/AIDS</a> or <a href="cancer">cancer</a>, to promote <a href="wound%20healing">wound healing</a> following surgery or injury, or when otherwise recommended by a medical professional. Juven, a nutrition product which contains 3 grams of , 14 grams of <a href="arginine">-arginine</a>, and 14 grams of <a href="glutamine">-glutamine</a> per two servings, has been shown to improve <a href="lean%20body%20mass">lean body mass</a> during clinical trials in individuals with AIDS and cancer, but not <a href="rheumatoid%20arthritis">rheumatoid cachexia</a>. Further research involving the treatment of cancer cachexia with Juven over a period of several months is required to adequately determine treatment efficacy.

With an appropriate exercise program, dietary supplementation with 3 grams of HMB per day has been shown to increase exercise-induced gains in muscle size, muscle strength and power, and lean body mass, reduce exercise-induced skeletal muscle damage, and expedite recovery from high-intensity exercise. Based upon limited clinical research, HMB supplementation may also improve aerobic exercise performance and increase gains in <a href="physical%20fitness">aerobic fitness</a> when combined with <a href="high-intensity%20interval%20training">high-intensity interval training</a>. These effects of HMB are more pronounced in untrained individuals and athletes who perform high intensity resistance or aerobic exercise. In resistance-trained populations, the effects of HMB on muscle strength and lean body mass are limited. HMB effects muscle size, strength, mass, power, and recovery in part by stimulating <a href="myofibrillar">myofibrillar</a> muscle <a href="protein%20synthesis">protein synthesis</a> and inhibiting muscle <a href="protein%20breakdown">protein breakdown</a> through various mechanisms, including the activation of <a href="mechanistic%20target%20of%20rapamycin%20complex%201">mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1</a> (mTORC1) and inhibition of <a href="proteasome">proteasome</a>-mediated <a href="proteolysis">proteolysis</a> in skeletal muscles.

The efficacy of HMB supplementation for reducing skeletal muscle damage from prolonged or high-intensity exercise is affected by the time that it is used relative to exercise. The greatest reduction in skeletal muscle damage from a single bout of exercise has been shown to occur when is ingested  hours prior to exercise or is ingested  minutes prior to exercise.

In 2006, only about 2% of college <a href="student%20athlete">student athlete</a>s in the United States used HMB as a dietary supplement. As of 2017, HMB has found widespread use as an <a href="ergogenic%20supplement">ergogenic supplement</a> among athletes. HMB has not been banned by the <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">National Collegiate Athletic Association</a>, <a href="World%20Anti-Doping%20Agency">World Anti-Doping Agency</a>, or any other prominent national or international athletic organization.

The <a href="drug%20safety">safety profile</a> of HMB in adult humans is based upon evidence from <a href="clinical%20trials">clinical trials</a> in humans and <a href="animal%20studies">animal studies</a>. In humans, no <a href="adverse%20effect">adverse effect</a>s in young adults or older adults have been reported when HMB is taken in doses of 3 grams per day for up to a year. Studies on young adults taking 6 grams of HMB per day for up to 2 months have also reported no adverse effects. Studies with supplemental HMB on young, growing rats and livestock have reported no adverse effects based upon <a href="clinical%20chemistry">clinical chemistry</a> or observable characteristics; for humans younger than 18, there is limited data on the safety of supplemental HMB. The <a href="human%20equivalent%20dose">human equivalent dose</a> of HMB for the <a href="no-observed-adverse-effect%20level">no-observed-adverse-effect level</a> (NOAEL) that was identified in a rat model is approximately 0.4 g/kg of <a href="Human%20body%20weight">body weight</a> per day.

Two animal studies have examined the effects of HMB supplementation in pregnant pigs on the offspring and reported no adverse effects on the fetus. No clinical testing with supplemental HMB has been conducted on pregnant women, and pregnant and lactating women are advised not to take HMB by <a href="Metabolic%20Technologies%2C%20Inc.">Metabolic Technologies, Inc.</a>, the company that grants licenses to include HMB in dietary supplements, due to a lack of safety studies.

Several components of the <a href="signaling%20cascade">signaling cascade</a> that mediates the HMB-induced increase in human skeletal muscle protein synthesis have been identified "<a href="in%20vivo">in vivo</a>". Similar to HMB's <a href="Precursor%20%28chemistry%29">metabolic precursor</a>, , HMB has been shown to increase protein synthesis in human skeletal muscle via <a href="phosphorylation">phosphorylation</a> of the <a href="mechanistic%20target%20of%20rapamycin">mechanistic target of rapamycin</a> (mTOR) and subsequent activation of , which leads to <a href="Translation%20%28biology%29">protein biosynthesis</a> in cellular <a href="ribosome">ribosome</a>s via phosphorylation of mTORC1's immediate targets (i.e., the <a href="p70S6%20kinase">p70S6 kinase</a> and the <a href="protein%20translation">translation</a> repressor protein <a href="4EBP1">4EBP1</a>). Supplementation with HMB in several non-human animal species has been shown to increase the <a href="blood%20serum">serum</a> concentration of <a href="growth%20hormone">growth hormone</a> and <a href="insulin-like%20growth%20factor%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B1">insulin-like growth factor 1</a> (IGF-1) via an unknown mechanism, in turn promoting protein synthesis through increased mTOR phosphorylation. Based upon limited clinical evidence in humans, supplemental HMB appears to increase the secretion of growth hormone and IGF-1 in response to resistance exercise.

, the signaling cascade that mediates the HMB-induced reduction in muscle protein breakdown has not been identified in living humans, although it is well-established that it attenuates <a href="proteolysis">proteolysis</a> in humans "in vivo". Unlike , HMB attenuates muscle protein breakdown in an <a href="insulin">insulin</a>-independent manner in humans. HMB is believed to reduce muscle protein breakdown in humans by inhibiting the <a href="19S">19S</a> and <a href="20S">20S</a> subunits of the <a href="ubiquitin%E2%80%93proteasome%20system">ubiquitin–proteasome system</a> in skeletal muscle and by inhibiting <a href="apoptosis">apoptosis</a> of <a href="myonuclei">skeletal muscle nuclei</a> via unidentified mechanisms.

Based upon animal studies, HMB appears to be metabolized within skeletal muscle into <a href="cholesterol">cholesterol</a>, which may then be incorporated into the <a href="sarcolemma">muscle cell membrane</a>, thereby enhancing membrane integrity and function. The effects of HMB on muscle <a href="protein%20metabolism">protein metabolism</a> may help stabilize muscle cell structure. One review suggested that the observed HMB-induced reduction in the plasma concentration of muscle damage <a href="Biomarker%20%28medicine%29">biomarkers</a> (i.e., muscle enzymes such as <a href="creatine%20kinase">creatine kinase</a> and <a href="lactate%20dehydrogenase">lactate dehydrogenase</a>) in humans following intense exercise may be due to a cholesterol-mediated improvement in muscle cell membrane function.

HMB has been shown to stimulate the <a href="cell%20proliferation">proliferation</a>, <a href="Cellular%20differentiation">differentiation</a>, and <a href="cell%20fusion">fusion</a> of human <a href="myosatellite%20cells">myosatellite cells</a> "<a href="in%20vitro">in vitro</a>", which potentially increases the regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle, by increasing the protein expression of certain <a href="myogenic%20regulatory%20factors">myogenic regulatory factors</a> (e.g., <a href="myoD">myoD</a> and <a href="myogenin">myogenin</a>) and gene <a href="transcription%20factor">transcription factor</a>s (e.g., <a href="MEF2">MEF2</a>). HMB-induced human myosatellite cell proliferation "in vitro" is mediated through the phosphorylation of the <a href="mitogen-activated%20protein%20kinase">mitogen-activated protein kinase</a>s <a href="ERK1">ERK1</a> and <a href="ERK2">ERK2</a>. HMB-induced human myosatellite differentiation and accelerated fusion of myosatellite cells into muscle tissue "in vitro" is mediated through the phosphorylation of <a href="protein%20kinase%20B">Akt</a>, a <a href="serine/threonine-specific%20protein%20kinase">serine/threonine-specific protein kinase</a>. 

The free acid () and monohydrated calcium salt () forms of HMB have different <a href="pharmacokinetics">pharmacokinetics</a>. HMB-FA is more readily absorbed into the bloodstream and has a longer <a href="elimination%20half-life">elimination half-life</a> (3 hours) relative to HMB-Ca (2.5 hours). Tissue uptake and utilization of HMB-FA is higher than for HMB-Ca. The fraction of an ingested dose that is excreted in urine does not differ between the two forms.
After ingestion, is converted to following <a href="Dissociation%20%28chemistry%29">dissociation</a> of the calcium <a href="Moiety%20%28chemistry%29">moiety</a> in the gut. When the HMB-Ca <a href="dosage%20form">dosage form</a> is ingested, the magnitude and time at which the peak plasma concentration of HMB occurs depends on the dose and concurrent food intake. Higher HMB-Ca doses increase the rate of <a href="Absorption%20%28pharmacokinetics%29">absorption</a>, resulting in a peak plasma HMB level (<a href="Cmax%20%28pharmacology%29">C</a>) that is disproportionately greater than expected of a linear <a href="dose-response%20relationship">dose-response relationship</a> and which occurs sooner relative to lower doses. Consumption of HMB-Ca with sugary substances slows the rate of HMB absorption, resulting in a lower peak plasma HMB level that occurs later.
HMB is eliminated via the <a href="kidneys">kidneys</a>, with roughly of an ingested dose being excreted unchanged in urine. The remaining of the dose is retained in tissues or excreted as HMB metabolites. The fraction of a given dose of HMB that is excreted unchanged in urine increases with the dose.

The metabolism of HMB is catalyzed by an uncharacterized enzyme which converts it to <a href="%CE%B2-hydroxy%20%CE%B2-methylbutyryl-CoA"></a> (). HMB-CoA is metabolized by either <a href="enoyl-CoA%20hydratase">enoyl-CoA hydratase</a> or another uncharacterized enzyme, producing <a href="%CE%B2-methylcrotonyl-CoA">β-methylcrotonyl-CoA</a> () or <a href="hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA">hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA</a> () respectively. is then converted by the enzyme <a href="methylcrotonyl-CoA%20carboxylase">methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase</a> to <a href="methylglutaconyl-CoA">methylglutaconyl-CoA</a> (), which is subsequently converted to by <a href="methylglutaconyl-CoA%20hydratase">methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase</a>. is then cleaved into and <a href="acetoacetate">acetoacetate</a> by <a href="HMG-CoA%20lyase">lyase</a> or used in the production of cholesterol via the <a href="mevalonate%20pathway">mevalonate pathway</a>.

In healthy individuals, approximately 60% of dietary is metabolized after several hours, with roughly 5% ( range) of dietary being converted to .<includeonly> Around 40% of dietary is converted to , which is subsequently used in the synthesis of other compounds.</includeonly>

The vast majority of metabolism is initially catalyzed by the <a href="branched-chain%20amino%20acid%20aminotransferase">branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase</a> enzyme, producing (α-KIC). α-KIC is mostly metabolized by the <a href="mitochondria">mitochondria</a>l enzyme <a href="branched-chain%20alpha-keto%20acid%20dehydrogenase">branched-chain dehydrogenase</a>, which converts it to <a href="isovaleryl-CoA">isovaleryl-CoA</a>. Isovaleryl-CoA is subsequently metabolized by <a href="isovaleryl-CoA%20dehydrogenase">isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase</a> and converted to , which is used in the synthesis of acetyl-CoA and other compounds. During <a href="biotin%20deficiency">biotin deficiency</a>, HMB can be synthesized from via <a href="enoyl-CoA%20hydratase">enoyl-CoA hydratase</a> and an unknown <a href="thioesterase">thioesterase</a> enzyme, which convert into and into HMB respectively. A relatively small amount of α-KIC is metabolized in the <a href="liver">liver</a> by the <a href="cytosol">cytosol</a>ic enzyme <a href="4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate%20dioxygenase">4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase</a> (KIC dioxygenase), which converts α-KIC to HMB. In healthy individuals, this minor pathway – which involves the conversion of to α-KIC and then HMB – is the predominant route of HMB synthesis.

By extension, other structural analogs include <a href="%CE%B2-hydroxybutyric%20acid">acid</a> and <a href="%CE%B2-methylbutyric%20acid">acid</a>.

A variety of synthetic routes to acid have been developed. The first reported <a href="chemical%20syntheses">chemical syntheses</a> approached HMB by oxidation of <a href="alkene">alkene</a>, <a href="vicinal%20%28chemistry%29">vicinal</a> <a href="diol">diol</a>, and <a href="alcohol">alcohol</a> precursors:
Depending on the experimental conditions, <a href="cycloaddition">cycloaddition</a> of <a href="acetone">acetone</a> and <a href="ketene">ketene</a> produces either or 4,4-dimethyloxetan-2-one, both of which <a href="Hydrolysis">hydrolyze</a> under basic conditions to yield the conjugate base of HMB. The <a href="haloform%20reaction">haloform reaction</a> provides another pathway to HMB involving the exhaustive halogenation of the methyl-ketone region of <a href="diacetone%20alcohol">diacetone alcohol</a> with <a href="sodium%20hypobromite">sodium hypobromite</a> or <a href="sodium%20hypochlorite">sodium hypochlorite</a>; Diacetone alcohol is readily available from the <a href="aldol%20condensation">aldol condensation</a> of acetone. An <a href="organometallic%20chemistry">organometallic</a> approach to HMB involves the <a href="carboxylation">carboxylation</a> of <a href="tert-butyl%20alcohol">"tert"-butyl alcohol</a> with <a href="carbon%20monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> and <a href="Fenton%27s%20reagent">Fenton's reagent</a> (<a href="hydrogen%20peroxide">hydrogen peroxide</a> and <a href="ferrous%20iron">ferrous iron</a>). Alternatively, HMB can be prepared through <a href="fermentation">microbial oxidation</a> of acid by the fungus "<a href="Galactomyces%20reessii">Galactomyces reessii</a>".
The concentration of naturally produced HMB has been measured in several human <a href="body%20fluid">body fluid</a>s using <a href="nuclear%20magnetic%20resonance%20spectroscopy">nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy</a>, <a href="liquid%20chromatography%E2%80%93mass%20spectrometry">liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry</a>, and <a href="gas%20chromatography%E2%80%93mass%20spectrometry">gas chromatography–mass spectrometry</a> methods. In the blood plasma and <a href="cerebrospinal%20fluid">cerebrospinal fluid</a> (CSF) of healthy adults, the average <a href="molar%20concentration">molar concentration</a> of HMB has been measured at 4.0 <a href="micromolar">micromolar</a> (μM). The average concentration of HMB in the <a href="sarcoplasma">intramuscular fluid</a> of healthy men of ages has been measured at 7.0 μM. In the urine of healthy individuals of any age, the excreted urinary concentration of HMB has been measured in a range of  <a href="micromole">micromole</a>s per millimole (μmol/mmol) of <a href="creatinine">creatinine</a>. In the breast milk of healthy lactating women, HMB and have been measured in ranges of  μg/L and  mg/L. In comparison, HMB has been detected and measured in the milk of healthy cows at a concentration of  μg/L. This concentration is far too low to be an adequate dietary source of HMB for obtaining pharmacologically active concentrations of the compound in blood plasma.

In a study where participants consumed 2.42 grams of pure while fasting, the average plasma HMB concentration increased from a basal level of 5.1  to 408 μM after 30 minutes. At 150 minutes post-ingestion, the average plasma HMB concentration among participants was 275 μM.

Abnormal HMB concentrations in urine and blood plasma have been noted in several disease states where it may serve as a <a href="diagnostic%20biomarker">diagnostic biomarker</a>, particularly in the case of <a href="metabolic%20disorder">metabolic disorder</a>s. The following table lists some of these disorders along with the associated HMB concentrations detected in urine or blood plasma.

The first reported <a href="chemical%20synthesis">chemical synthesis</a> of HMB was published in 1877 by the Russian chemists Michael and <a href="Alexander%20Mikhaylovich%20Zaytsev">Alexander Zaytsev</a>. HMB was isolated from the bark of "<a href="Erythrophleum">Erythrophleum couminga</a>" (a Madagascan tree) in 1941 by <a href="Leopold%20Ru%C5%BEi%C4%8Dka">Leopold Ružička</a>. The earliest reported isolation of HMB as a human <a href="metabolite">metabolite</a> was by Tanaka and coworkers in 1968 from a patient with <a href="isovaleric%20acidemia">isovaleric acidemia</a>.

The effects of HMB on human skeletal muscle were first discovered by Steven L. Nissen at <a href="Iowa%20State%20University">Iowa State University</a> in the . Nissen founded a company called <a href="Metabolic%20Technologies%2C%20Inc.">Metabolic Technologies, Inc.</a> (MTI) around the time of his discovery, which later acquired six HMB-related <a href="patent">patent</a>s that the company has used to license the right to manufacture and incorporate HMB into dietary supplements. When it first became available commercially in the late 1990s, HMB was marketed solely as an exercise supplement to help athletes and bodybuilders build muscle. MTI subsequently developed two HMB-containing products, Juven and Revigor, to which <a href="Abbott%20Nutrition">Abbott Nutrition</a> obtained the market rights in 2003 and 2008 respectively. Since then, Abbott has marketed Juven as a medical food and the Revigor brand of HMB as an active ingredient in food products for athletes (e.g., certain formulations of Myoplex) and other medical foods (e.g., certain formulations of Ensure).

Charlie Macartney

Charles George "Charlie" Macartney (27 June 1886  – 9 September 1958) was an Australian <a href="cricketer">cricketer</a> who played in 35 <a href="Test%20cricket">Tests</a> between 1907 and 1926. He was known as "The Governor-General" in reference to his authoritative batting style and his flamboyant <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Batting%20technique%20and%20strokeplay">strokeplay</a>, which drew comparisons with his close friend and role model <a href="Victor%20Trumper">Victor Trumper</a>, regarded as one of the most elegant batsmen in cricketing history. Sir <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Donald Bradman</a>—generally regarded as the greatest batsman in history—cited Macartney's dynamic batting as an inspiration in his cricket career.

He started his career as a bowling <a href="all-rounder">all-rounder</a>. He made his Test debut in 1907, primarily as a <a href="left%20arm%20orthodox%20spin">left arm orthodox spin</a>ner who was considered to be a useful lower-middle order right-hand batsman. As Macartney was initially selected for his flexibility, his position in the batting order was frequently shuffled and he was largely ineffective. His most noteworthy Test contribution in his early career was a match-winning ten wicket haul at <a href="Headingley%20Stadium">Headingley</a> in 1909, before being dropped in the 1910–11 Australian season. It was around this time that Macartney befriended Trumper and began to transform himself from a bowler who batted in a defensive and technically correct manner, into an audacious attacking batsman. He reclaimed his Test position and made his maiden Test century in the same season, before establishing himself as the leading batsman in the team.

The <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> stopped all first-class cricket and Macartney enlisted in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a>. Upon the resumption of cricket, Macartney stamped himself as one of the leading batsmen in the world with his performances during the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201921">1921 Ashes tour</a>. Macartney produced an Australian record score in England of 345 against <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a>. The innings was the fastest triple century in first-class cricket and the highest score made by a batsman in a single day of play. He reached 300 in 205 minutes and the innings took less than four hours. Macartney topped the <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a>s and run-scoring aggregates, which saw him named as one of the five <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">Wisden Cricketers of the Year</a> in 1922. <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden</a> said that he was, "by many degrees the most brilliant and individual Australian batsman of the present day". After missing the 1924–25 series due to mental illness or a recurrence of war injuries, Macartney departed international cricket at the peak of his powers on the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201926">1926 tour of England</a>. He became the second Australian to score a century in the first session of a Test match, and did so on a <a href="sticky%20wicket">sticky wicket</a> conducive to bowling. This was part of a sequence of three consecutive Test centuries as he led the batting charts. Macartney was posthumously inducted into the <a href="Australian%20Cricket%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Australian Cricket Hall of Fame</a> in 2007.

Macartney's flair was compared to that of Victor Trumper, and his determination to that of <a href="Don%20Bradman">Don Bradman</a>, who is generally regarded as the finest batsman in cricketing history. His style was quite different from that of Trumper, but he generated fascination with his Trumper-like daring and supreme confidence. Self-taught to a greater extent than anyone else in Australia or England in his era, the 1922 "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Almanack</a>" described Macartney as "a triumph to individualism... he is not a model to be copied" and "one of the most brilliant and attractive right-handed batsmen in the history of Australian cricket". His success was largely attributed to his eye, hand and foot co-ordination.

Macartney was a short man, standing 160 cm (5" 3). When batting, he would unconventionally attempt to <a href="leg%20glance">leg glance</a> <a href="yorker">yorker</a>s pitched on middle <a href="Stump%20%28cricket%29">stump</a> down to <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23T">fine-leg</a>, and often lost his wicket in so doing. He was known for preferring his team-mates to give him candid criticism rather than praise. In later life he condemned modern batsmen; he would explain why he no longer watched cricket by saying "I can't bear watching luscious half-volleys being nudged gently back to bowlers". Sir <a href="Neville%20Cardus">Neville Cardus</a> wrote that "there was always chivalry in his cricket, a prancing sort of heroism. The dauntlessness of his play, the brave beauty and the original skill bring tears to my eyes yet." In the late 1940s, Macartney received a letter from a compiler of "<a href="Who%27s%20Who%20in%20Australia">Who's Who in Australia</a>", seeking information on his life. Macartney said that he had "no record of figures, nor am I concerned with them. My only interest is the manner in which the runs are compiled and how wickets are taken, and in the good of the game." "Those sentiments", wrote former Australian Test batsman <a href="Jack%20Fingleton">Jack Fingleton</a>, "summed up the cricket story of C. G. Macartney".

An authoritative, combative stylist, Macartney's élan and devastating strokemaking led <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent</a> cricketer <a href="Kenneth%20Hutchings">Kenneth Hutchings</a> to dub him "The Governor-General". Fingleton noted that, early in his innings, Macartney had a strategy of aiming a shot straight at the bowler's head, in order to rattle him and seize a psychological advantage. On one occasion, after reaching a century before lunch on the first day of a match, he immediately called for a bat change. He selected the heaviest bat from the batch that his team-mate brought out and stated "Now I'm going to have a hit". His rate of scoring and boundary-hitting subsequently increased. He possessed powerful hands, strong forearms and broad shoulders. <a href="Leg%20spin">Leg spin</a>ning Test team-mate <a href="Arthur%20Mailey">Arthur Mailey</a> recalled that Macartney would often hit him for <a href="six%20%28cricket%29">six</a> in <a href="Sydney%20Grade%20Cricket">Sydney Grade Cricket</a> matches. Grinning, he would say "Pitch another one there and I'll hit you for a few more". On the occasions when he lost his wicket attempting further long hits, Macartney's grin remained, and he would remark "Wasn't it good fun?" The famed cricket writer <a href="RC%20Robertson-Glasgow">RC Robertson-Glasgow</a> said

As a bowler, Macartney delivered the ball at a relatively fast pace for a <a href="left-arm%20orthodox%20spin">left-arm orthodox spin</a>ner, comparable in speed to <a href="Derek%20Underwood">Derek Underwood</a>. He was known for his consistent length and his well-concealed faster ball which often caught batsmen off guard. On <a href="sticky%20wicket">sticky wicket</a>s, he was often incisive, and these conditions helped him take five wickets in an innings 17 times in his <a href="First-class%20cricket">first-class</a> career. He was known for his miserly attitude, often giving the impression that he would rather bowl ten consecutive <a href="over%20%28cricket%29">maidens</a> rather than take wickets if it meant conceding runs. This extended to his off-field activities, where he was considered careful with money. On the 1926 tour of England, he and Mailey visited a hat shop that had a tradition of giving souvenir hats to cricketers of touring Australian squads. When asked if he would like a similar style to the one he received in 1921, Macartney referred to the hat on his head and replied "Not on your life. I've been wearing this since you gave it to me in 1921." Macartney's notorious fiscal obsessions irritated his captain <a href="Warwick%20Armstrong">Warwick Armstrong</a> on the 1921 tour; during the trip, he would hoard all manner of goods that were given to the team as gifts.

In 1909, Australian team-mate Trumper moved from <a href="Paddington%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Paddington</a>, a suburb on Sydney's south shore to Chatswood on the northern side of the harbour, where Macartney lived. Macartney and Trumper played together for <a href="Gordon%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Gordon</a> Cricket Club on the north shore and became close friends. Macartney regularly practised on the Trumper family's backyard turf pitch. Trumper's relocation made more frequent meetings possible, since the <a href="Sydney%20Harbour%20Bridge">Sydney Harbour Bridge</a> was not to open until 1932, and the only way of travelling between either side of the bay was by ferry. Trumper was regarded as the "crown prince of the golden age of cricket", the finest and most stylish batsman of his era, and one of the most elegant strokemakers of all time. Under Trumper's influence, Macartney became more audacious and adventurous; Unlike their English counterparts, the Australians were proud of their spontaneous play. Macartney revered Trumper as both a cricketer and a person, and was to be a <a href="pall%20bearer">pall bearer</a> when Trumper died in 1915 at the age of 37. However, unlike Trumper, Macartney was known for his habit of "walking", the act of leaving the ground before or contrary to an umpire's decision if a batsman knows that he is out. On one occasion, Macartney felt so guilty that the umpire had incorrectly ruled him not out despite a clear edge that he attempted to throw his wicket away with a wild airborne shot. However, the ball went for six, and Trumper, his batting partner at the time, admonished him, saying that his good luck would be balanced by occasions when the umpire would give him out incorrectly.

Macartney was born in <a href="Maitland%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Maitland, New South Wales</a>. He was taught to play cricket as a child by his maternal grandfather <a href="George%20Moore%20%28cricketer%29">George Moore</a>, a slow <a href="roundarm%20bowling">roundarm bowler</a> who represented <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team">New South Wales</a> in three first-class matches against <a href="Victorian%20Bushrangers">Victoria</a>. The equipment consisted of small hand-crafted bat made from <a href="Cedar%20wood">cedar</a>, and apples from the family orchard used as balls.

In 1898, Macartney and his family moved from <a href="Maitland">Maitland</a> to <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>. In his school cricketing career Macartney distinguished himself as an all-rounder at <a href="Woollahra%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Woollahra</a> Superior and <a href="Chatswood%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Chatswood</a> public schools, before briefly attending <a href="Fort%20Street%20High%20School">Fort Street High School</a>. Macartney asserted that school cricket was insignificant in his development, believing that he learned more about cricket during informal summer cricket games with his brother at the local park, with their dog acting as a fielder. It was during his school career that Macartney was noticed by incumbent Australian captain <a href="Monty%20Noble">Monty Noble</a>, who heaped praise on him in a newspaper article.

After leaving school, Macartney worked for a fruit and vegetable merchant near Sydney's Sussex Street docks, honing his batting skills by practising without <a href="Cricket%20clothing%20and%20equipment">pads</a> on a wooden wharf during his lunch break. At this stage in his career, he possessed a copybook technique and defensive style, something he was to discard for an audacious, self-styled and attacking outlook.

In 1902, Macartney joined <a href="North%20Sydney%20Cricket%20Club">North Sydney Cricket Club</a> in the first division of <a href="Sydney%20Grade%20Cricket">Sydney Grade Cricket</a> and then moved to the <a href="Gordon%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Gordon</a> club in the outer northern suburbs when it was formed during the 1905–06 season. He played regularly for Gordon until 1933–34 when he was 47, amassing 7648 runs at an <a href="batting%20average">average</a> of 54.62. He was known for his dominant status at the <a href="Chatswood%20Oval">Chatswood Oval</a>. In one match, he lofted a ball out of the ground, over a railway line and onto an adjacent lawn bowling green, forcing the players to take evasive action.

Macartney's exploits were noticed by the State selectors, and he made his first class debut for <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team">New South Wales</a> against <a href="Queensland%20Bulls">Queensland</a> at the start of the 1905–06 season. He made 56 in New South Wales' first innings of 691, and after not bowling in the first innings, he took 3/80 and his first catch in an innings victory. He then scored 70 not out in an innings triumph over <a href="Southern%20Redbacks">South Australia</a>. He failed to pass 25 in his remaining four matches for the season, but took at least one wicket in each game. In one match for his state against an Australian XI, Macartney took a total of 5/123, including the wickets of Trumper and Australian Test captains Noble and <a href="Joe%20Darling">Joe Darling</a>. He was also <a href="run%20out">run out</a> in both innings. Aside from this match, New South Wales were victorious in the remaining five fixtures. He scored 185 runs at 26.43 and took 15 wickets at 28.20 in six matches.

Macartney continued his rise with a more productive and consistent second season with both the ball and bat. In his second match in 1906–07, Macartney broke through for his first century, scoring 122 before taking match figures of 4/92 in an innings win over Queensland. In the next match, he took his first five-wicket innings haul, recording figures of 5/18 and 2/17 in an innings win over South Australia, including leading Test batsman <a href="Clem%20Hill">Clem Hill</a> twice. Macartney took wickets in each match; he ended the season with 405 runs at 40.50, with two further fifties, and took 30 wickets at 18.20 in nine matches.

The following season, in 1907–08, saw the arrival of <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England</a> for a Test series. Macartney had a chance to stake his claim for national selection in a match for his state against the tourists. He made 9 and 13, unbeaten in both innings, as his partners were dismissed cheaply and left him stranded. New South Wales made 101 and 96 and lost by 408 runs, with Macartney taking a total of 1/64. He was selected for an Australian XI to play the tourists in an effective dress rehearsal for the Tests, and made 42 and took 4/36 in a drawn match. As a result,
Macartney was selected to make his debut against England in the First Test at the <a href="Sydney%20Cricket%20Ground">Sydney Cricket Ground</a>. He was viewed as a utility player, selected for the flexibility in his batting position and his left arm orthodox spin.

Macartney had a moderately successful debut. He bowled three wicketless overs in the first innings, before scoring 35 in Australia's reply while batting at <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">No. 7</a>. He took one wicket, that of leading English batsman <a href="Wilfred%20Rhodes">Wilfred Rhodes</a>. With Australia needing 274 runs to win in the second innings, Noble decided that Macartney's first innings effort warranted promotion to act as Trumper's opening partner. He managed to score only nine, but Australia managed to scrape home to seal a two wicket victory. Macartney's domestic form after his Test debut was sufficient for him to retain his position for the Second Test in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. Noble persevered with Macartney as Trumper's opening partner and he scored 37 of an 84 run opening partnership in the first innings. He returned to the <a href="middle%20order">middle order</a> in the second innings to score 54 and took a total of 1/55 as England squared the series with a narrow one wicket victory.

His most productive batting of the series came in the Third Test in <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, when he scored 75 batting at No. 3 and took two wickets for 66 runs (2/66) in an Australian victory. His batting was largely ineffectual in the last two Tests; he failed to score more than 30 in any innings as he was moved to No. 8 and then back to the opening position in the Fifth Test. Despite his confused role as a batsman, he contributed with the ball in the Fifth Test victory on a pitch amenable to spin, taking match figures of 5/66. His first international series had yielded 273 runs at an average of 27.30 and ten wickets at an <a href="bowling%20average">average</a> of 26.60. He tasted victory, with Australia taking the series 4–0. His highest score of the season was 96 against England in a later match for New South Wales. The hosts were 12 runs short of victory with one wicket in hand when time ran out. Macartney scored 524 runs at 27.58 and took 25 wickets at 28.76 in 12 matches. In spite of his unsettled role in the batting line up, Macartney had performed well-enough as an all-rounder in the following domestic season in 1908–09 to be selected for the 1909 tour of England, his first overseas tour. Macartney took a total of 6/60 in an innings victory over South Australia in the first match of the season. He then scored 100 in the return match, and ended the six matches of the summer with 319 runs at 53.17 and nine wickets at 29.89.

Macartney started his tour of England by taking match figures of 5/86 in a nine-wicket win over <a href="Northamptonshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Northamptonshire</a>. He took at least two wickets in each of the five matches leading up to the Tests, with 5/24 against <a href="Oxford%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Oxford University</a>. He totalled 17 wickets at 15.18 and scored 141 runs at 28.20.

Macartney took 3/21 in the first innings of the First Test, removing captain <a href="Archie%20MacLaren">Archie MacLaren</a>, <a href="CB%20Fry">CB Fry</a> and leading batsman <a href="Jack%20Hobbs">Jack Hobbs</a>, but managed only 0/35 in the second innings as England scored 0/105 to win by ten innings. He then scored five and was wicketless as Australia leveled the series with a nine-wicket win in the Second Test. He then scored 124, his only century of the tour, in a non-first-class match against Western Union.

His bowling confounded the English team in the Third Test at <a href="Headingley%20Stadium">Headingley</a> in <a href="Leeds">Leeds</a>, where he took 7/58 in the first innings and 4/27 in the second. It was his best innings and match bowling figures in Tests and helped win the Test and eventually retain <a href="The%20Ashes">The Ashes</a>. Australia had struggled to post 188 in their first innings on a pitch conducive to <a href="spin%20bowling">spin bowling</a>, with Macartney scoring only four. Australia responded with a dual spin attack, with Noble bowling <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a> in tandem with Macartney's left arm orthodox. Noble (0/22 from 13 overs) tied down the batsman, allowing Macartney to attack at batsman at the other end. He bowled with a high trajectory, tempting the batsmen to attack him and then varied his <a href="Bowling%20strategy%20%28cricket%29%23Line%20.26%20length">bowling speed</a> to surprise them. He had <a href="Jack%20Sharp">Jack Sharp</a> <a href="Stumping%23Manner%20of%20dismissing%20a%20batsman">stumped</a> after luring him from the <a href="crease%20%28cricket%29">crease</a> and bowled <a href="Jack%20Hobbs">Jack Hobbs</a> with a <a href="Bowling%20strategy%20%28cricket%29%23Line%20%26amp%3B%20length">faster ball</a>. Other victims included English captain MacLaren, <a href="JT%20Tyldesley">JT Tyldesley</a>, <a href="George%20Hirst">George Hirst</a> and <a href="Sydney%20Barnes">Sydney Barnes</a>. England were bowled out for 182 and Australia replied with 207; Macartney scored 18. Australia went on to win by 126 runs after Macartney took four more wickets in the second innings, removing MacLaren, Tyldesley, Rhodes and Barnes to help dismiss the hosts for 87. Macartney then made a half-century and took a wicket in each of the last two Tests, both of which were drawn to hand Australia a 2–1 series win.

Macartney's batting in the Test series was largely unsuccessful. He made two fifties, but otherwise failed to pass 20 and ended with 153 runs at 19.13. In his era, the expectation was that batsmen would be able to bat in a variety of positions and Macartney was gradually moved from seventh down to tenth in the batting order by the end of the tour. Largely due to his efforts at Headingley, his bowling figures were more impressive; he ended the Tests with 16 wickets at 16.13. At this stage of his career, Macartney was regarded as a bowling all-rounder. He was only eighth on the batting averages for the tour, with 503 first-class runs at 16.77, but took 71 wickets at an average of 17.46 in eight matches.

Upon returning to the southern hemisphere, Macartney headed to <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> for a stint with <a href="Otago%20cricket%20team">Otago</a> instead of playing in Australia in 1909–10, due to attractiveness of the foreign outfit's remuneration. The period was unsuccessful for Otago—all three matches were lost—but Macartney was prolific as an individual. He took match figures of 7/68 against <a href="Canterbury%20cricket%20team">Canterbury</a> and 7/81 in the first innings of a game against Australia, removing Test teammates <a href="Warwick%20Armstrong">Warwick Armstrong</a> and <a href="Warren%20Bardsley">Warren Bardsley</a>. He ended with 17 wickets at 17.53 and scored 132 runs at 22.00.

Macartney started poorly in the home series against the touring South Africans in the Test series of 1910–11. In the first three Tests, he accumulated 15 runs in five innings and took a solitary wicket. As a result, he was dropped for the Fourth Test. Up to this point he had not passed 45 in 13 innings for the season and taken only seven wickets in seven matches. He then made 119 and 126 for New South Wales against South Africa and took match figures of 4/155 as the tourists fell to a 44-run defeat. This prompted the selectors to restore him to the Test team, and Macartney bounced back with his first Test century, making 137 in the first innings and 56 in the second in just 40 minutes, as Australia completed a seven-wicket win. It was his third century in as many first class innings. The late-season hat-trick of centuries pushed Macartney's season total to 609 runs at 33.83 and 10 wickets at 54.90 in ten matches.

The 1911–12 season started strongly for Macartney. He scored 122 and took 5/81 as New South Wales defeated Queensland by an innings. However, the season went downhill from there; Macartney failed to pass 30 in the next ten innings and took only three wickets in the next six matches. As a result, he was left out of the playing XI and made <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23T">twelfth man</a> for the first three Tests against the touring England team.

Macartney's omission was part of the most infamous disputes in Australian cricket history and led to a fracas. Australian captain and selector <a href="Clem%20Hill">Clem Hill</a> wanted to include Macartney for the Third Test, but another member of the panel, former player <a href="Peter%20McAlister">Peter McAlister</a> objected and said that Hill should omit himself if he wanted Macartney to play. Tensions between the two selectors were high, and came to a head in a selection meeting ahead of the Fourth Test. McAlister criticised Hill's tactics and policies towards his bowlers, provoking an exchange of insults regarding the other's leadership ability. Hill then bloodied McAlister with a powerful blow to the nose and the ensuing brawl lasted between 10 and 20 minutes. Furniture was knocked across the room, artwork shattered and Hill had to be restrained from throwing McAlister out of the third floor window, before resigning as a selector.

Eventually, Macartney was recalled for the Fifth Test against England and scored 26 and 27 and took a total of 1/54 in a defeat. Macartney scored 300 runs at 27.27 and took nine wickets at 32.78 in eight first-class matches for the season. Macartney wrote later that "persistent ill-feeling seriously affected the morale of the side".

Macartney then toured England for the 1912 Triangular Test Tournament, which also included South Africa. He was not in the original touring party, but six senior players including Hill and vice-captain <a href="Warwick%20Armstrong">Warwick Armstrong</a> and leading batsman <a href="Victor%20Trumper">Victor Trumper</a> withdrew from the tour due to a dispute with the board. Macartney was thus given a late call-up.

Macartney scored 84 but the tourists started on a bad note, losing to <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a>. He then scored 127 against <a href="Northamptonshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Northamptonshire</a>, 208 against <a href="Essex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Essex</a>, 123 and 25 not out against <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a> and 74 against the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> in four consecutive matches. Australia won the first two by an innings and the latter two by seven and five wickets respectively. Up to this point, Macartney had only claimed a solitary wicket. He then took match figures of 6/60 in a ten-wicket win over <a href="Oxford%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Oxford University</a>.

Australia then defeated South Africa in their first Test of the tournament. Macartney made 21 in an innings victory and did not bowl. Macartney's batting waned in the next seven tour matches, passing 50 only three times in ten innings. However, he did take 13 wickets, including 6/54 against <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a>. Macartney then scored 99 in a drawn Test against England at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a> that did not reach the second innings. "Wisden" regarded the innings as his best for the season. Macartney added half-centuries in consecutive county matches and after three further matches without passing 21, the Tests resumed.

Macartney scored nine and took 3/29 in a ten-wicket win over South Africa, and then scored 142 and 121 in the next match against <a href="Sussex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Sussex</a>. The next Test against England was then washed out in the first innings; Macartney neither batted nor bowled. The following match against South Africa did not reach the second innings and Australia then lost to England by 244 runs in the final, with Macartney taking a total of 2/67 and scoring four and 30. It was a barren August for Macartney, who did not pass 35 and took only six wickets in six first-class matches. However, he finished the tour strongly, scoring 176 against the <a href="South%20of%20England%20cricket%20team">South of England</a> and 71 against <a href="CB%20Fry">CB Fry</a>'s XI in the last two matches.

Macartney scored 2,207 runs during the tour at an average of 45.04. During the English season, he reached the peak of his performance as an all-rounder, taking 38 wickets. He made six centuries, including two in one match against <a href="Sussex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Sussex</a>. Apart from his 99 at Lord's, Macartney did not pass 34 in the other Tests and ended with 197 runs at 32.83. He did not bowl heavily during the series, taking six wickets at 23.66. It was not a happy tour for the Australians; without the senior players, there were frequent reports of drunken brawls and verbal abuse towards the locals. Macartney was one of only four players to accept the guaranteed tour fee of 400 pounds; the others signed up to a percentage share of the profits and the commercial failure of the tour left them with less than half of the flat fee.

There were no further Test matches before the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>. The 1912–13 Australian season was a short one for Macartney, but he was in rare form, scoring 125, 96, 94, 76 not out, 91, 10 and 154 in four matches, to total 646 runs at 107.66. He also took four wickets at 30.50.

During an unofficial tour of the Australian team to the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> and <a href="Canada">Canada</a> during the off season in 1913, which consisted of more than 50 matches, the overwhelming majority of which were not first-class, Macartney scored 2,390 runs at 45.92 and took 189 wickets at 3.81, topping both the batting and bowling averages. He also made the most centuries (seven) and the highest individual score of 186 against a combined Canada and United States team. Macartney played in only five first-class matches and scored two centuries in these fixtures. In two non-first-class matches, he took 11/23 and 10/29 in an innings.

The 1913–14 domestic season was to be the last season of cricket before the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. Macartney captained New South Wales for the first time against <a href="Tasmanian%20Tigers">Tasmania</a>. He had another prolific season with the bat; in six matches he scored 892 runs at 111.50 in nine innings. He scored 201 in an innings victory over Victoria, four other centuries including a 195, and two fifties. With Macartney in such form, five of the matches were won by an innings, and another by nine wickets. The record was blotted only by a loss to South Australia by 19 runs. Macartney took two wickets at 32.50. Macartney was selected for the five-Test tour of South Africa in 1914–15, but the campaign was called off due to the war.

Despite his success on the field, Macartney still had a regular job outside of cricket, as with most cricketers of the era. In 1914, he left his job on the Sydney wharves and joined the staff of New South Wales Railways & Tramways in the Chief Mechanical Engineer's Office at <a href="Redfern%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Redfern</a>. The following season, he scored 191 runs at 38.20 including a century in three matches. He did not take a wicket.

<a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> interrupted Macartney's career as competitive cricket was cancelled. In January 1916, he enlisted in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF). In July 1917 he was posted to <a href="France">France</a> as a temporary Warrant Officer in the 3rd Division Artillery. In 1918, he was awarded the <a href="Meritorious%20Service%20Medal%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Meritorious Service Medal</a> for gallantry and reached the rank of <a href="corporal">corporal</a>. The death of his father later in the year led to his repatriation from Britain and prevented his appearance with the <a href="Australian%20Imperial%20Forces%20cricket%20team">AIF cricket team</a>.

The war years divided Macartney's career in two. Prior to the war, he was primarily known as a bowling all-rounder. In 21 Tests, he had taken 34 wickets at 26 and scored 879 runs at 27, with one century. After the war, Macartney transformed himself into one of the greatest batsmen of his era. In his 14 post-war Tests, he scored 1,252 runs at nearly 70, with six centuries. His bowling became more sporadic, taking just 11 more wickets, averaging 32.

Macartney resumed Test cricket when Australia hosted England in 1920–21, and was one of only four players remaining from before the war. However, he only played in two of the Tests due to illness and injury. His early season form was ominous for the tourists. Macartney scored 161 in guiding New South Wales to a successful run-chase of 4/335 over the Englishmen. He then scored 96 and 30 for an Australian XI against the tourists in a dress rehearsal for the Tests.

In the First Test, playing as an opening batsman, he struck 19 in the first innings. Australia's new post-war skipper <a href="Warwick%20Armstrong">Warwick Armstrong</a> felt that Macartney would be more effective at number three, and in the second innings, he made a free-flowing 69 in a 111-run second-wicket stand with <a href="Herbie%20Collins">Herbie Collins</a> as Australia went on to inflict a 377-run defeat. Macartney's return to form was interrupted by an illness, which caused him to miss the following three Test matches. After a two-month layoff, Macartney struck 130 in a match for his state against England.

He returned for the Fifth and final Test, where he recorded his highest Test innings of 170 on his home ground, the <a href="Sydney%20Cricket%20Ground">Sydney Cricket Ground</a>. Among the spectators was a 12-year-old <a href="Don%20Bradman">Don Bradman</a>, who had been taken to watch Macartney by his father. Eight decades later, Bradman recalled the innings, "as if it were yesterday", describing it as full of "delicate leg-glances, powerful pulls, cuts and glorious drives" and concluding that it was one of the best innings he had seen in his lifetime. Bradman cited the innings as an inspiration for his career. Macartney headed the Australian Test averages with 260 runs at 86.66 as Australia won the Ashes 5–0. It was the only such Ashes whitewash until 2006–07. Macartney has amassed 821 runs at 68.42 for the season. He took only three wickets at 56.33.

On the 1921 Ashes tour, Macartney—who needed a special medical clearance before being selected— had a chance to rectify his poor batting performances of his pre-war tours of England. In his first match, against <a href="Leicestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Leicestershire</a>, he started strongly with 177. his fast scoring helped Australia complete an innings victory in just over half the allotted playing time. He scored 87 against <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a>, 51 against Combined Services and 77 against <a href="Oxford%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Oxford University</a> in the next seven matches leading up to the start of the Tests, with a total of 539 runs at 53.90 under his belt.

Macartney made 20 in the first innings and was unbeaten on 22, playing as an opener, as Australia completed a ten-wicket win in the First Test. It was Australia's sixth consecutive Test win over England. He failed to pass 20 in the next two county matches, but did take 2/19 against <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesex</a>, his first wickets on tour. This came in his 11th match on tour and was a reflection of his role as a specialist batsman in the post-war years. The next game against <a href="Gloucestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Gloucestershire</a> heralded the start of a rich vein of run-scoring during the remainder of June. Macartney scored 149, in an Australian innings noted for elegant strokeplay and big hitting, after managing only 31 and eight in the eight-wicket win in the Second Test, hit three consecutive centuries.

Macartney hit 105 as Australia amassed 7/708 declared against <a href="Hampshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Hampshire</a> and then made 193 as Australia compiled 621 and defeated <a href="Northamptonshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Northamptonshire</a> by an innings and 484 runs. The two matches were separated by a match against Surrey, which Macartney missed due to injury. In the latter match, Macartney came in at first drop after the hosts took a wicket from the first ball of the match, and he scored 193 of the 318 runs scored while he was in the middle. Macartney took only 135 minutes and hit 31 fours as Australia added more than 300 in just over two hours of batting. Such was the dominance of Macartney and the rest of Armstrong's men that they disposed of Northamptonshire in less than two days. However, his most famed innings was yet to come.

In the next match, Macartney scored 345 against <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a> at Trent Bridge in 232 minutes, with 47 fours and four sixes. Macartney had an inauspicious start to the day, coming to the crease after the dismissal of <a href="Warren%20Bardsley">Warren Bardsley</a> with only one run scored. He attacked immediately and was dropped in the slips when on nine runs. The missed chance further emboldened Macartney, who had a philosophy that being dropped was a signal that it was his day to shine. He proceeded to exhibit his full repertoire of strokes. After reaching his double century in only 150 minutes, Macartney signalled to the pavilion. When Nottinghamshire captain <a href="Arthur%20Carr%20%28cricketer%29">Arthur Carr</a> asked him if he was seeking a drink, Macartney said that he wanted a heavier bat and indicated that he was going to attack. Macartney kept his promise, adding his next 100 runs in only 48 minutes to reach 300 in 198 minutes. At the time, it was the fastest triple century in first-class cricket in terms of minutes. It still stands as the highest innings by an Australian in England, and at the time was the most runs scored by any batsman in one day. During the innings, Macartney partnered <a href="Nip%20Pellew">Nip Pellew</a> in a partnership of 291. Australia went on to score 675 and won by an innings and 517 runs, in only two days, the largest winning margin achieved by Australia in a first-class match. The cricket writer <a href="Sumner%20Reid">Sumner Reid</a> described Macartney's innings as:

the most destructive innings I ever saw in England or Australia. Not Trumper at his brilliant best, nor even Bradman in his calculated genius, ever performed with more unadulterated, murderous power and masterful technique.

In the space of four days, Macartney had scored 538 runs, and for the month of June, he had totalled 913 runs at 91.30. He carried this form into the next Test.

In the Third Test at <a href="Headingley%20Stadium">Headingley</a>, he made his first Test century on foreign soil, striking 115 in the first innings. It was a relatively sedate innings for his standards, but helped Australia to victory by 191 runs and an unassailable 3–0 series lead. It gave <a href="Warwick%20Armstrong">Warwick Armstrong</a>'s men an eighth consecutive Test win, which remained a world record for more than five decades until surpassed by the <a href="West%20Indies%20cricket%20team">West Indies cricket team</a> of the 1980s. The cricket writer <a href="Gideon%20Haigh">Gideon Haigh</a> said that "It was like watching the armies of succeeding generations in combat, artillery, and tank against sword and horse".

Macartney had a quiet time over the next month, passing fifty only once in the next eight innings in seven matches. He also ended his wicket-taking drought, claiming six in three matches after almost two months without success. He returned to form with 72 against <a href="Warwickshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Warwickshire</a> and 155 in the next match against <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent</a>.

Macartney finished with 61 in the drawn Fifth Test at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a>, to head the run-scoring with 300 runs at 42.85 as Australia took the series 3–0. He did not take a wicket in the Tests. Macartney then scored 121 against <a href="Gloucestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Gloucestershire</a> in an innings victory immediately after the Tests, but did not pass 45 in the remaining four matches of the tour. Macartney topped the batting aggregates and averages with 2,317 runs at 59.41 in the first-class matches. He took only eight wickets at 32.63 for the entire tour.

Macartney's efforts during the 1921 English summer led to his being named as one of the 1922 <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">Wisden Cricketers of the Year</a>. "Wisden" stated that Macartney was "by many degrees the most brilliant and individual Australian batsman of the present day".

On the journey back to the southern hemisphere, Australia stopped for its first ever Test tour of South Africa. Macartney warmed up with 135 in a victory over <a href="Natal%20cricket%20team">Natal</a>. The cricket writer <a href="Jack%20Pollard">Jack Pollard</a> described Macartney's hitting as "powerful, almost arrogant". Macartney then scored 59 and 116 in an aggressive display in the First Test in <a href="Durban">Durban</a>, which was drawn, with the hosts hanging on with only three wickets in hand. After missing the Second Test due to fitness reasons, Macartney returned against <a href="Western%20Province%20cricket%20team">Western Province</a>. He took 5/40 in the first innings, his first five-wicket innings since June 1912, nine and a half years earlier.

In the Third Test in <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>, Macartney scored 44, before taking 5/44 in the second innings to ensure that Australia would only have to chase a solitary run. He bowled three of his victims and removed <a href="Billy%20Zulch">Billy Zulch</a> twice. The hosts struggled against the dual spin of Macartney and Mailey. Australians went on to secure a ten-wicket victory. Macartney finished the Test series with seven wickets at 14.86. He totalled 492 runs at 70.28 and 14 wickets at 17.14 for the tour, against topping the batting averages.

Macartney started the 1922–23 season strongly, scoring 63 and 84 and taking 2/8 in a five-wicket win over the touring MCC in the first match of the summer. He only passed fifty once more in the season and took 5/8 in an innings against Victoria. Macartney totalled 350 runs at 29.16 and 12 wickets at 12.16 in eight matches for the season. The next Australian season was a shortened one for New South Wales. Macartney scored 174 runs at 21.75 and took seven wickets at 21.14 in four matches before his state embarked on a tour of New Zealand.

Macartney struck form immediately, scoring 80 and 120 in the opening match against <a href="Wellington%20cricket%20team">Wellington</a>. He followed this with 100 (in a non-first-class match), 120 against <a href="Otago%20cricket%20team">Otago</a> and 221 in the next match against <a href="Canterbury%20cricket%20team">Canterbury</a>, all in consecutive innings. He added match figures of 4/38 as New South Wales defeated Canterbury by an innings. Macartney then scored 36 and 55 not out and took match figures of 4/55 in an eight-wicket win over New Zealand. He made only two and seven in the remaining first-class matches, and ended with 13 wickets at 20.92.

Macartney missed the 1924–25 Test series when England toured Australia. He played in only two first-class matches in the early stages of the season, scoring 11 runs at 3.66 and taking five wickets at 23.40. The withdrawal of Macartney from competition was attributed to a flare-up of an injury he had suffered during World War I, but sceptics believed that he had suffered a <a href="nervous%20breakdown">nervous breakdown</a>.

Following his year off, Macartney returned to full-time cricket in 1925–26. He re-established himself in his first match, scoring 114 and taking a total of 4/49 as New South Wales crushed Western Australia by an innings and 235 runs. Macartney then scored 84 and 28 to help the Rest of Australia defeat the national team by 156 runs. He then scored two centuries as New South Wales won all four of their Sheffield Shield matches, three by an innings. Up to this point, Macartney had scored 582 runs at 72.75 and taken 20 wickets at 20.30. This was enough for him to be selected for the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201926">1926 tour of England</a>. His most notable performance with the ball was his 7/85 and 2/16 in an innings victory over arch-rivals Victoria. His wickets included batsmen <a href="Bill%20Woodfull">Bill Woodfull</a> (twice), <a href="Bill%20Ponsford">Bill Ponsford</a>, <a href="Jack%20Ryder%20%28cricketer%29">Jack Ryder</a> and all rounder <a href="Hunter%20Hendry">Hunter Hendry</a>, who played alongside him in the 1926 Tests. Following his selection for the England tour, Macartney warmed up by scoring 66 and 163 not out and taking a total of 4/48 in consecutive innings victories for the Australian touring party over <a href="Tasmanian%20Tigers">Tasmania</a>.

Macartney's international farewell on the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201926">1926 tour of England</a> saw him at the peak of his batting powers. Unlike the previous tour in 1921, Macartney was also prominent with the ball.

During the opening first-class fixture against Leicestershire, Macartney scored only two but took 5/9 in a rain-affected draw. In the next match against <a href="Essex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Essex</a>, another rain-affected draw, he starred with the bat, scoring 148. In the third match, another draw against <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a>, Macartney combined both of his skills and scored 53 and took 6/63 in the first innings. His victims included English Test batsmen <a href="Jack%20Hobbs">Jack Hobbs</a> and <a href="Percy%20Fender">Percy Fender</a>. He then took 3/21 and 4/57 as Australia beat <a href="Hampshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Hampshire</a> to record their first win of the season. In nine matches before the First Test, Macartney scored 379 runs at 42.11 and took 30 wickets at 13.20.

The First Test at <a href="Trent%20Bridge">Trent Bridge</a> was washed out, with England scoring 0/32 in the only innings of the match. Macartney then scored 54 as Australia made 6/148 in the only innings of another wet match against <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a>. He then hit form ahead of the Second Test, scoring 160 and taking a total of 5/34 in an innings win over <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a>.

After scoring 39 in the first innings in the Second Test at Lord's, Macartney took 1/90, removing centurion <a href="Jack%20Hobbs">Jack Hobbs</a> as England took a 92-run first innings lead. He then scored 133 not out in the second innings, to help to stave off defeat. Australia were 5/194 when the match ended, and were it not for Macartney's effort could have been bowled out.

Between Tests, Macartney scored 42 and 81 against <a href="Northamptonshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Northamptonshire</a> and <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a> respectively before taking 5/38 against <a href="Worcestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Worcestershire</a>. Australia won all three matches.

In the Third Test at Headingley, Macartney became only the second batsman to score a century before lunch on the opening day of a Test. The match started poorly for Australia. English captain <a href="Arthur%20Carr%20%28cricketer%29">Arthur Carr</a> won the toss and sent Australia in to bat after a thunderstorm on the previous day had turned the surface into a sticky wicket; Bardsley was then dismissed by the first ball for a golden duck. Macartney strode to the crease, surveyed the fielding positions and called down the wicket to the bowler <a href="Maurice%20Tate">Maurice Tate</a> "Let's have it!" He nearly regretted his comment when he edged the ball to Carr at third slip from the fifth ball of the day. It was a difficult chance but the English skipper failed to hold the ball. Macartney was then on two. Within a few minutes, he had regained the initiative for the Australians.

Utilising both conventional technique and audacious shots, Macartney pierced the field with a variety of <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Batting%20technique%20and%20strokeplay">cuts, hooks, pulls, drives and glances</a>. He teased the fielders with deliberate deflections through the slips; his late cuts were described by <a href="Raymond%20Robertson-Glasgow">Raymond Robertson-Glasgow</a> as being "so late they are almost posthumous". Macartney's attack helped his partner <a href="Bill%20Woodfull">Bill Woodfull</a> to settle in the difficult conditions. Macartney saved his severest hitting for <a href="George%20Macaulay">George Macaulay</a>, a medium pace <a href="swing%20bowling">swing bowler</a> and <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a>ner whom he regarded as England's most potent bowler. Macartney had asked for and received permission from captain <a href="Herbie%20Collins">Herbie Collins</a> to target Macaulay's bowling. By the end of the Australian innings, Macaulay had figures of 1/123 and was never to play against Australia again. Macartney's confidence was such that he charged down the pitch to meet the medium pace bowlers, a dangerous tactic on a surface with erratic bounce.

He reached 40 in as many minutes as Australia's total reached 50. Australia reached 100 in only 79 minutes with Macartney contributing 83 of those runs. Macartney reached his century in 103 minutes with the tourists on 131. By lunch, he had scored 112 in 116 minutes and he continued until the score reached 1/235, when he hit Macaulay to <a href="Patsy%20Hendren">Patsy Hendren</a> and was dismissed, having amassed 151 in 170 minutes. Former English captain Sir <a href="Pelham%20Warner">Pelham Warner</a> said "I say without hesitation that I have never seen a greater innings... not even the immortal Victor Trumper could have played more finely". Macartney's innings allowed Australia to accumulate a healthy first innings total of 494. He then took 2/51, removing Carr and Fender as England made 294 and were forced to <a href="follow%20on">follow on</a>; however, the Australians could not dismiss the hosts for a second time and the match ended in a draw.

Macartney then made 106 in a non-first-class match against the West of Scotland, before hitting 109 in the Fourth Test at <a href="Old%20Trafford%20%28cricket%20ground%29">Old Trafford</a> in a rain-affected draw; the match failed to reach the second innings. Macartney had scored three centuries in as many innings.

Macartney's form tailed off thereafter; in the following six weeks, he made only one score beyond 40 in 11 innings and took only three wickets in nine matches. This included the Fifth Test, when he scored 25 and 16 and failed to take a wicket as England won the Test by 289 runs and with it the Ashes. Macartney topped the batting averages with 473 runs at 94.60 and took four wickets at 53.75. Macartney returned to form in the final first-class fixture of the season with an unbeaten 100 against and England XI.

Macartney decided to retire from Tests after the tour. He had taken part in twelve Test century partnerships, the highest being 235 with Woodfull in the Leeds Test.

After his return to Australia, Macartney continued to play club cricket and turned out for a final first-class summer. At the start of the 1926–27 season, he captained a combined Sydney City team against a New South Wales country team, which included the then 18-year-old Bradman. Macartney scored 126 and Bradman 98 in a match viewed as a generational transition in Australian batting. He scored 114 in his opening first-class match of the season, and took wickets in each of his four matches. Macartney totalled 243 runs at 40.50 and took 11 wickets at 17.82.

In mid-1927 he toured <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> and <a href="British%20Malaya">Malaya</a> with <a href="Bert%20Oldfield">Bert Oldfield</a>'s team and played in a series of non-first-class matches against local teams. In October 1929, he played for a <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Cricket%20Association">New South Wales Cricket Association</a> team against a series of local teams in the state's rural west.

In 1935–36, Macartney was vice-captain to <a href="Jack%20Ryder%20%28cricket%29">Jack Ryder</a>, on the tour of India organised by <a href="Frank%20Tarrant">Frank Tarrant</a>; he also wrote forthright columns for "<a href="The%20Hindu">The Hindu</a>", covering the trip. At the time, India had only received its first official tour, by England, and Australia was not keen on sending a Test team there. Thus, while the Test team were in South Africa, Tarrant's party consisted mainly of retired Test cricketers in their mid-40s and beyond.

In his return to first-class cricket after nine years, Macartney took 5/17 and 3/42 in the first international match against <a href="Indian%20cricket%20team">India</a>, which the Australians won by eight wickets. He went wicketless as the series was squared in the second match, before taking 3/52 and 6/41 in the final match. Despite his nine wickets, Australia lost by 34 runs. Other notable performances included an 85 against <a href="Bengal%20cricket%20team">Bengal</a> and 3/45 and 3/47 against <a href="Tamil%20Nadu%20cricket%20team">Madras</a>. In the latter match, Macartney added 39 as the Australians scraped home by one wicket.

Macartney married Anna Bruce, a schoolteacher, at Chatswood Presbyterian Church in December 1921. At the time, the "NSW Railway & Tramway Magazine" noted that he was a "strict teetotaller and non-gambler" who loved his pipe, tennis and music. After his marriage, Macartney described himself as a civil servant while he was not engaged in cricketing activities. Like most Australian cricketers of his era, Macartney was Protestant, and a <a href="freemason">freemason</a>.

Macartney wrote for several Sydney newspapers, and between 1936 and 1942 regularly produced pieces for the "<a href="Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">Sydney Morning Herald</a>". In 1930 he published the autobiographical "My Cricketing Days". During the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, he was a lieutenant in the amenities service of the <a href="Australian%20Defence%20Force">Australian Defence Force</a>, and afterwards was a personnel officer at <a href="Prince%20Henry%20Hospital">Prince Henry Hospital</a>.

Childless, Macartney was predeceased by his wife. He died of coronary occlusion (heart attack) while at work in <a href="Little%20Bay%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Little Bay, New South Wales</a>, aged 72. In February 2007, Macartney was inducted into the <a href="Australian%20Cricket%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Australian Cricket Hall of Fame</a> along with <a href="Richie%20Benaud">Richie Benaud</a>, making them the 26th and 27th inductees.

Homeworld

Homeworld is a <a href="real-time%20strategy">real-time strategy</a> video game developed by <a href="Relic%20Entertainment">Relic Entertainment</a> and published by <a href="Sierra%20Entertainment">Sierra Studios</a> on September 28, 1999, for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>. Set in space, the <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> game follows the Kushan exiles of the planet Kharak after their home planet is destroyed by the Taiidan Empire in retaliation for developing <a href="teleportation">hyperspace jump</a> technology. The survivors journey with their spacecraft-constructing <a href="mother%20ship">mothership</a> to reclaim their ancient homeworld of Hiigara from the Taiidan, encountering a variety of pirates, mercenaries, traders, and rebels along the way. In each of the game's levels, the player gathers resources, builds a fleet, and uses it to destroy enemy ships and accomplish mission objectives. The player's fleet carries over between levels, and can travel in a fully <a href="three-dimensional%20space">three-dimensional space</a> within each level rather than being limited to a <a href="plane%20%28geometry%29">two-dimensional plane</a>.

"Homeworld" was created over two years, and was the first game developed by Relic. Studio co-founders <a href="Alex%20Garden">Alex Garden</a> and Luke Moloney served as the director and lead programmer for the game, respectively. The initial concept for the game's story is credited to writer <a href="David%20J.%20Williams">David J. Williams</a>, while the script itself was written by Martin Cirulis and the background lore was written by author <a href="Arinn%20Dembo">Arinn Dembo</a>. The music of the game was written by composer <a href="Paul%20Ruskay">Paul Ruskay</a> as the first title from his Studio X Labs, with the exception of <a href="Samuel%20Barber">Samuel Barber</a>'s 1936 "<a href="Adagio%20for%20Strings">Adagio for Strings</a>", considered the defining theme of the game, and a licensed track from English rock band <a href="Yes%20%28band%29">Yes</a>, "<a href="The%20Ladder%20%28Yes%20album%29">Homeworld (The Ladder)</a>".

"Homeworld" is listed by review aggregator <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> as the highest rated computer game of 1999, and the fourth-highest on any platform for the year. Critics praised the game's graphics, unique gameplay elements, and multiplayer system, though opinions were divided on the game's plot and high difficulty. The game sold over 500,000 copies in its first 6 months, and received several awards and nominations for best strategy game of the year and best game of the year. A release of the game's source code in 2003 sparked unofficial <a href="porting">ports</a> to <a href="macOS">macOS</a> and <a href="Linux">Linux</a>, and three more games in the "Homeworld" series have been produced: "" (2000), "<a href="Homeworld%202">Homeworld 2</a>" (2003), and "" (2016). <a href="Gearbox%20Software">Gearbox Software</a> purchased the rights to the series from then-owners <a href="THQ">THQ</a> in 2013, and released a remastered collection of "Homeworld" and "Homeworld 2" in 2015 for Windows and macOS which was also highly regarded.

"Homeworld" is a <a href="real-time%20strategy">real-time strategy</a> game set in space. Gameplay, as in most real-time strategy titles, is focused on gathering resources, building military forces, and using them to destroy enemy forces and accomplish an objective. The game includes both <a href="single-player%20video%20game">single-player</a> and <a href="multiplayer%20video%20game">multiplayer</a> modes; the single-player mode consists of one story-driven campaign, broken up into levels. In each level, the player has an objective to accomplish before they can end the level, though the ultimate objective of the mission can change as the level's story unfolds. Between each of the 16 levels is a hand-drawn, black-and-white cutscene with narrative voiceovers.
The central ship of the player's fleet is the <a href="mother%20ship">mothership</a>, a large base which can construct other ships; unlike other spacecraft, in the single-player campaign the mothership is unable to move. Present in each level are stationary rocks or dust clouds, which can be mined by specialized harvesting ships which then empty their loads at the mothership in the form of "resources", the game's only currency. Resources can be spent by the player on building new ships, which are constructed by the mothership. Buildable <a href="spacecraft">ships</a> come in a variety of types, which are discovered over the course of the game. They include resource harvester ships, small fighter ships, frigates, destroyers, and heavy cruisers, as well as specialized ships such as research vessels and repair corvettes. Fighter ships need to return to the mothership periodically to refuel, while salvage corvettes can capture enemy ships and tow them to the mothership to become part of the player's fleet. In some levels, new ship types can be unlocked by capturing an enemy ship of that type, through research performed at the research vessel, or through plot elements. At the beginning of the campaign, the player may select between controlling the "Kushan" or "Taiidan" fleet; this affects the designs of the ships and changes some of the specialized ship options, but has no effect on the plot or gameplay.

Each level's playable area is a sphere, bisected by a circular plane. Ships can be directed to move anywhere in that sphere, either singularly or in groups. The game's camera can be set to follow any ship and view them from any angle, as well as display the ship's point of view. The player may also view the "Sensors Manager", wherein they can view the entire game map along with all visible ships. Ships can be grouped into <a href="tactical%20formation">formations</a>, such as wedges or spheres, in order to provide tactical advantages during combat with enemy ships. Non-specialized ships are equipped with weapons to fire upon enemy ships, which include ballistic guns, <a href="particle-beam%20weapon">beam weapons</a>, and missiles. As a ship is damaged by weapons its health bar depletes, visual effects such as fire and smoke are added, and it can eventually explode.

When all mission objectives are completed, the player is given the option to make a <a href="teleportation">hyperspace jump</a> to end the level. This may be postponed in order to gather more resources or build more ships. When the hyperspace jump is initiated, all fighters return to the mothership while larger ships line up next to it, and blue rectangles pass over the ships and teleport them to the next level. The player retains their fleet between levels, and the difficulty of each mission is adjusted to a small extent based on how many ships are in the player's fleet at the beginning of each level. In multiplayer games, the objective is typically to destroy the enemy motherships, though other battle-oriented victory conditions are available. The mothership is capable of movement, and as there are no levels, the research done at the research vessel follows a <a href="technology%20tree">technology tree</a> with each upgrade or ship design taking a set amount of time, rather than also being dependent on a plot point. Multiple maps are available, as are options to turn off the need to research technologies or fuel consumption for smaller ships.

A century prior to the start of the game, the Kushan, <a href="humanoid">humanoid</a> inhabitants of the desert planet Kharak, discovered a spaceship buried in the sands, which holds a stone map marking Kharak and another planet across the galaxy labelled "Hiigara", meaning "home". The discovery united the clans of Kharak, who knew they were not indigenous to Kharak and craved to solve the mystery of how they came to this hostile planet. Together, they spent the next century developing and building a giant <a href="mothership">mothership</a> that would carry 600,000 people to Hiigara, with <a href="neuroscientist">neuroscientist</a> Karan S'jet neurally wired into the ship as Fleet Command to replace an unsustainably large crew. The game opens with the maiden voyage of the mothership, testing the <a href="hyperspace">hyperspace</a> drive which <a href="teleportation">teleports</a> the fleet to a new destination. Instead of the support ship that was expected to be there, the mothership finds a hostile alien fleet. After defeating them, the mothership returns to Kharak, to discover that the planet has been razed by another alien fleet, and that only the 600,000 migrants in <a href="suspended%20animation">suspended animation</a> have survived. A captured enemy captain claims that the Kharak genocide was the consequence of their violation of a 4,000-year-old treaty between the interstellar Taiidan Empire and the Kushan, which forbids the latter's from developing hyperspace technology.

After destroying the remnants of both alien fleets, the nascent Kushan fleet sets out for Hiigara, intent on reclaiming their ancient homeworld. Their multi-stage journey across the galaxy takes them through asteroid fields, a giant nebula, a ship graveyard and several Taiidan outposts. Along the way, they fight other descendants of their Hiigaran ancestors who have turned to piracy. They also meet the Bentusi, a race of traders, who sell them advanced technology. After discovering that the Bentusi have given aid to the exiles, the Taiidan attempt to destroy them, but are stopped by the Kushan fleet. The Bentusi then reveal that the Kushan had once ruled their own empire, before being destroyed by the Taiidan and exiled from Hiigara. In gratitude for the Kushan's intervention, they promise to summon the Galactic Council to consider the Kushan's claim to Hiigara.

As their journey continues, the Kushan fleet gives sanctuary to the Taiidan rebel Captain Elson. With his help, they rally a rebellion to distract the Taiidan fleets. He aids them in penetrating the Hiigaran system blockade, and in engaging the central Taiidan fleet led by the Taiidan emperor. The emperor manages to knock Karan into a coma for the duration of the battle, but the combined Kushan and rebel fleets defeat the Taiidan regardless. The Galactic Council arrives shortly thereafter and confirms the Kushan's claim to Hiigara, a lush world in contrast to the desert planet of Kharak. When the Kushan make landfall, Karan insists to be the last one to set foot on the planet.

Relic Entertainment was founded in Vancouver, Canada, on June 1, 1997, and began work on "Homeworld" as their first title. Relic co-founders <a href="Alex%20Garden">Alex Garden</a> and Luke Moloney served as the director and lead programmer for the game, respectively, while Erin Daly was the designer and Aaron Kambeitz the lead artist. Garden was 22 years old when he founded the company. Writer <a href="David%20J.%20Williams">David J. Williams</a> is credited with the original story concept, while the script itself was written by Martin Cirulis and the background lore was written by author <a href="Arinn%20Dembo">Arinn Dembo</a>. Cirulis and Dembo, credited jointly as "Marcus Skyler", were selected by the publisher, <a href="Sierra%20Entertainment">Sierra Studios</a>, partway through development to expand the story concept of Relic and Williams. Sierra agreed to publish the game early in development based on, according to Garden, "two whiteboard presentations and no demo". The development of the game took over two years; the game systems were largely complete by the final eight months, which Relic spent polishing and improving the game, including adding the whole-map Sensors Manager view. The game was initially expected to be released at the end of 1998; Garden stated in a 1999 interview that the team found creating the core game itself much easier than getting it to the quality level they wanted, and that if they had known how difficult it was going to be they may have chosen not to do the project. Several ideas for the game, including ship customization, convoy routes, and different unit types for the Kushan and Taidann fleets were cut during development as they could not be done well enough for the project.

Relic did not specifically set out to create a real-time strategy game; Garden and Relic were primarily focused on making a game with exciting large-scale space battles, and chose the genre in order to support that. As a result, they did not try to make innovative gameplay changes in the real-time strategy genre, but instead worked on making implementing the genre in a fully 3D space to make the space battles they envisioned. Garden told "<a href="Computer%20Games%20Magazine">Computer Games Magazine</a>" in 1998 that "there's no sort of design philosophy behind it. The fact that it's real-time strategy was almost a fluke." The original "<a href="Star%20Wars">Star Wars</a>" film trilogy was one of the games primary inspirations, along with the 1970s television series "<a href="Battlestar%20Galactica%20%281978%20TV%20series%29">Battlestar Galactica</a>": in a 1998 interview with "<a href="PC%20Zone">PC Zone</a>", Garden stated that his original concept for the game was "a 3D game that looked like you were watching "Star Wars" but had a storyline like "Battlestar Galactica"". He drew further inspiration from correcting what he felt were the limitations of the first-person space flight game "". He felt that having the player control a ship from a cockpit view detracted from the feeling of the overall battles, and so chose to have the player control a whole fleet from an external view.

The focus on the combat drove several other areas of focus for the development team: according to Garden, Relic spent considerable effort on making high-quality ship models, computer-controlled flight tactics, and maneuvers like <a href="immelmann%20turn">immelmann turn</a>s because "everyone is going to zoom right in on the first battle, just to watch". They felt that the advanced unit-level maneuvers in the context of large fleet-wide battles would increase immersion in the game for players, and create a ""Star Wars" feeling" to the battles. To accentuate this, instead of recording stock sound files for units to use when maneuvering, the team instead recorded several thousand smaller clips which are combined to describe exactly which ships were taking which action, and are then modified by the game's audio engine to reflect the position and motion of the ships relative to the player's camera. The working title for the game was "Spaghetti Ball", chosen for Garden's early vision of the battles in the game as a mass of tangled flight paths as ships maneuvered around each other, contained within a larger sphere of available space. Although early previews expressed concern about the difficulties of controlling so many ships in 3D space, according to Garden the team felt that moving the game's camera and controlling the fleet were two wholly separate actions, and by treating them as such it made designing them and using them much simpler.

The sound design, audio production, and music composition for the game was contracted to composer <a href="Paul%20Ruskay">Paul Ruskay</a> and Studio X Labs, which he founded in February 1999 after starting on "Homeworld" in October 1998. In addition to his original music compositions, Ruskay used a recording of the 1936 piece for <a href="string%20orchestra">string orchestra</a> by <a href="Samuel%20Barber">Samuel Barber</a>, "<a href="Adagio%20for%20Strings">Adagio for Strings</a>", in an early scene in the game when the player finds the destruction of Kharak. The piece, in turn, became a central theme on the soundtrack. The closing song of the game, "<a href="The%20Ladder%20%28Yes%20album%29">Homeworld (The Ladder)</a>", was licensed from English rock band <a href="Yes%20%28band%29">Yes</a>. The soundtrack was released in a 13-track album that was bundled with the Game of the Year Edition of "Homeworld" in May 2000, and again in a 37-track "Homeworld Remastered Original Soundtrack" digital album alongside the "Homeworld Remastered Collection" in March 2015.

"Homeworld" was highly regarded by critics upon release; it is listed by review aggregator <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> as the highest rated computer game of 1999, and the fourth-highest on any platform for the year. The graphics were highly praised; Michael Ryan of <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> claimed it had "some of the most impressive graphics ever", while Jason Levine of "<a href="Computer%20Games%20Magazine">Computer Games Magazine</a>" said that "no game—ever—has made space itself look like this". <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>'s review praised the "big, brash and colourful" backgrounds, which was echoed by Levine and John Keefer of <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>. Multiple reviewers, such as Vincent Lopez of <a href="IGN">IGN</a>, also praised the detail and variety of the spaceships, and Jason Samuel of "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" noted that Relic was able to use their graphics engine to create the game's intricate <a href="cutscene">cutscene</a>s rather than relying on prerecorded videos. Greg Fortune of "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>" added that the rotatable camera was one of the "real joys of the game", allowing the player to view the action from any angle or ship's viewpoint and "creating an impressively sweeping cinematic feel". The sound and music were also lauded; Levine claimed the sound was "on par with the graphics", praising how it changed when the player zoomed into or away from a battle, while Eurogamer and Lopez applauded the "atmospheric" soundtrack for creating the mood of the game.

The gameplay advances were also highly praised by critics: Lopez claimed that "Relic not only tackled space, but may have just changed strategy games forever." Reviewers praised the full 3D nature of the game as elevating it from its otherwise standard real-time strategy gameplay systems; Levine said that the 3D was what made the game unique, and Ryan explicitly termed the base gameplay as "fairly similar to any tried-and-true real-time strategy game" but said that the 3D elements and connected mission structure turned it into a "different breed" of game. Fortune, however, focused instead on the difficulty of the missions themselves, praising the challenge and variety of tactics needed to complete the game and lauding it for having "some of the best fleet battles ever seen in a computer game". Levine, Ryan, Keefer, and Lopez all noted the connected mission structure as an innovation in the genre: by limiting the resources to build ships and pulling the same fleet through the missions, "Homeworld" converted what would usually be a set of disconnected missions into "chapters" of a continuous game. They felt this connected the player to their fleet as more than disposable units, and added a level of strategy to the game. Keefer and Levine did note, however, that this added a great deal of difficulty to the game, especially for more casual players, as the player could make decisions in earlier levels that rendered later ones very difficult to complete without an explicit difficulty level to counteract it. Ryan and Keefer also considered the 3D movement disorienting at first, though Levine and Samuel said the controls were "as easy as possible".

"Homeworld"s single-player plot received mixed reviews; Lopez claimed it would keep players "rapt with attention", Samuel summized it as a "superb story", and Levine said that it was "the first computer game to capture the grandeur and epic feel of the "<a href="Star%20Wars">Star Wars</a>" movies". The Eurogamer review, however, considered it only "(mostly) engaging", and Keefer said that "although the story line is fluid and intriguing", for each mission "the overall theme is the same: Kill the enemy", while Ryan criticized the length for such a "meager single-player game". The multiplayer gameplay was praised, especially against human opponents: Levine stated that "multiplayer in "Homeworld" is a joy", while the Eurogamer review called it the game's strongest part. The Eurogamer review, along with Samuel, also called the multiplayer mode more difficult and engaging than the single-player game.

"Homeworld" was released to strong sales and won multiple awards; it sold more than 250,000 copies in its initial weeks, and over 500,000 in its first six months. In the United States alone, the game's sales surpassed 95,000 copies by the end of 1999, while sales in Germany reached 60,000 units by April 2000. It debuted in third place on Germany's computer game sales rankings for October 1999, before dropping to 25th, 31st and 32nd in the following three months, respectively. "Homeworld" also received a "Silver" sales award from the <a href="Entertainment%20and%20Leisure%20Software%20Publishers%20Association">Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association</a> (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

"Homeworld" won Best Strategy Game at the 1999 <a href="Game%20Critics%20Awards">Game Critics Awards</a> prior to release, and was nominated for Computer Game of the Year and Computer Strategy Game of the Year at the 2000 <a href="Academy%20of%20Interactive%20Arts%20%26amp%3B%20Sciences">Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences</a> Interactive Achievement Awards. It was awarded Game of the Year by IGN and "<a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a>", won Strategy Game of the Year by "Computer Gaming World" and was nominated for the same by "Computer Games Magazine", and won Best Original Storyline and Best Original Score at the 2000 "Eurogamer" Gaming Globes awards. It also won "PC Gamer"s "Special Achievement in Music" and "Special Achievement in Art Direction" prizes. "<a href="Maximum%20PC">Maximum PC</a>" claimed in 2003 that "Homeworld" "did what no game had successfully done before: create a truly three-dimensional space-combat strategy game". "<a href="HardwareZone">HardwareMAG</a>" similarly claimed the "revolutionary" and "ground-breaking" status of the game in the real-time strategy genre in 2004, as did "Computer Gaming World" in 2003.

"Homeworld" inspired a series of real-time strategy games in the same universe, beginning in September 2000 when Sierra Studios released a <a href="expansion%20pack">stand-alone expansion</a> by <a href="Barking%20Dog%20Studios">Barking Dog Studios</a>, "". Taking place 15 years after the events of "Homeworld", the story centers on Kiith Somtaaw—a Hiigaran clan—and its struggles to protect Hiigara from a <a href="parasitism">parasitic</a> entity known as the Beast. A full sequel, "<a href="Homeworld%202">Homeworld 2</a>", was developed by Relic Entertainment and released by Sierra in late 2003. The game, set a century after the original "Homeworld", pits the Hiigarans against a powerful, nomadic raider race called the Vaygr. A fourth game in the series, "", was developed by <a href="Blackbird%20Interactive">Blackbird Interactive</a> and published by <a href="Gearbox%20Software">Gearbox Software</a> in 2016. A prequel to the series, it is set on the planet of Kharak instead of in space, and features a war between Kushan clans during the discovery of the buried spaceship from "Homeworld". Additionally, in 2003 Relic released the <a href="source%20code">source code</a> for "Homeworld" under license to members of the Relic Developer Network. The source code became the base of several <a href="source%20port">source port</a>s to alternative platforms, such as <a href="Linux">Linux</a>.

In 2004, Relic Entertainment was bought by <a href="THQ">THQ</a>, which confirmed in 2007 that it had acquired the rights to the series from Relic and Sierra. No further game in the series was made before THQ declared bankruptcy in 2013; on April 22, 2013, Gearbox Software announced that they had bought the rights to the series at auction for US$1.35 million. On July 19, 2013, Gearbox announced the production of remakes of "Homeworld" and "Homeworld 2" as "Homeworld HD", later renamed "Homeworld Remastered Collection". The following month, collection producer Brian Burleson stated that Gearbox had purchased the property with the express purpose of making a collection including the original and remastered versions of the game. He also noted that neither game had code in a releasable or playable state when purchased, and they ended up recreating many of the original development tools with the assistance of the "Homeworld" mod community. A later posting by a developer at Gearbox further praised the mod community for their assistance in getting the original code to be playable on modern computers. The stand-alone expansion "Homeworld: Cataclysm" was not announced for a remake, despite the outspoken interest of Gearbox, as they were unable to find the original source code for the game.

Released digitally on February 25, 2015, for Windows computers by Gearbox and on August 6, 2015, for macOS by <a href="Aspyr">Aspyr Media</a>, the collection includes the original and remastered versions of the two games. A retail edition of the PC version of the game was released by <a href="Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> on May 7, 2015. In addition to compatibility fixes for modern computers, the "classic" version of "Homeworld" removes local multiplayer and the licensed Yes song; the "remastered" version adds a new game engine for the two games, and upgraded visuals, graphical effects, models, and sound. It also initially removed some functionality not present in "Homeworld 2", such as the fuel system, ballistic projectile modeling, and tactical ship formations; some of these were restored in a 2016 patch.

As of February 2017, <a href="Steam%20Spy">Steam Spy</a> estimates that over 700,000 copies of the "Homeworld Remastered Collection" have been sold on the <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a> distribution platform. The remastered version was warmly received by critics; reviewers such as IGN's Dan Stapleton and "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>"s Daniel Tack praised the story as still "fantastic" and "emotional", while Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot claimed that the gameplay was still entertaining 16 years later, and Tom Senior of "<a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a>" applauded Gearbox's visual updates to the game. Reviewers were more mixed on the gameplay changes included as part of the upgrade to a new game engine; VanOrd noted that some of the changes did not fit with the original game, while Tack made note of several bugs due to the gameplay modifications. Overall, the updated game was highly praised, however, with Senior concluding bluntly that ""Homeworld" is simply incredible and everyone should play it."

Operation Retribution (1941)

Operation Retribution (), also known as Operation Punishment, was the April 1941 <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a> <a href="Strategic%20bombing">bombing</a> of <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a>, the capital of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Yugoslavia</a>, in retaliation for the <a href="Yugoslav%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a> that overthrew the government that had signed the <a href="Tripartite%20Pact">Tripartite Pact</a>. The bombing occurred in the first days of the German-led <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invasion of Yugoslavia</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Army%20Air%20Force">Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force</a> (VVKJ) had only 77 modern <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighter aircraft</a> available to defend Belgrade against the hundreds of German fighters and <a href="bomber">bomber</a>s that struck in the first wave early on 6 April. Three days prior, VVKJ <a href="Major">Major</a> <a href="Vladimir%20Kren">Vladimir Kren</a> had defected to the Germans, disclosing the locations of multiple military assets, as well as elucidating the VVKJ's codes.

Three more waves of bombers attacked Belgrade on 6 April, and more attacks followed in subsequent days. The attacks resulted in the paralysis of Yugoslav civilian and military command and control, the widespread destruction of Belgrade's infrastructure, and many civilian casualties. The bombing of Belgrade was preceded by the commencement of the ground invasion a few hours earlier, and coincided with air attacks on VVKJ airfields and other strategic targets across Yugoslavia. Among the non-military targets struck during the bombing were the <a href="National%20Library%20of%20Serbia">National Library of Serbia</a>, which burned to the ground with the loss of hundreds of thousands of books and manuscripts, and the <a href="Belgrade%20Zoo">Belgrade Zoo</a>.

The <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> carried out two bombing raids on <a href="Sofia">Sofia</a>, the capital of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, in retaliation for the attacks on Yugoslavia, which ultimately surrendered on 17 April. The senior <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> officer responsible for the bombing, "<a href="Generaloberst">Generaloberst</a>" <a href="Alexander%20L%C3%B6hr">Alexander Löhr</a>, was captured by the Yugoslavs at the end of the war and was tried and executed for war crimes, in part for his involvement in the bombing of Belgrade. Kren was arrested in 1947 on unrelated charges of war crimes stemming from his subsequent service as the head of the <a href="Air%20Force%20of%20the%20Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia</a>. He was extradited to Yugoslavia to face trial, found guilty on all counts and executed in 1948. A monument erected in <a href="New%20Belgrade">New Belgrade</a> in 1997 commemorates the Yugoslav airmen who were killed in Belgrade's defense. The bombing has been dramatised in literature and film.

Following <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Germany</a>'s 1938 "<a href="Anschluss">Anschluss</a>" of <a href="First%20Austrian%20Republic">Austria</a>, Yugoslavia shared a border with the Third Reich and came under increasing pro-<a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> political pressure as her neighbours fell into line with the Axis powers. In April 1939, Yugoslavia gained a second frontier with <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Italy</a> when that country <a href="Italian%20invasion%20of%20Albania">invaded Albania</a>. Between September and November 1940, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary%20%281920%E2%80%9346%29">Hungary</a> joined the <a href="Tripartite%20Pact">Tripartite Pact</a>, Italy <a href="Greco-Italian%20War">invaded Greece</a>, and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Romania">Romania</a> also joined the Pact. From that time, Yugoslavia was almost surrounded by Axis powers or their <a href="client%20state">client state</a>s, and her neutral stance toward the war was under tremendous pressure. On 14 February 1941, <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> invited Prime Minister <a href="Dragi%C5%A1a%20Cvetkovi%C4%87">Dragiša Cvetković</a> and Foreign Minister <a href="Aleksandar%20Cincar-Markovi%C4%87">Aleksandar Cincar-Marković</a> to <a href="Berchtesgaden">Berchtesgaden</a>, and requested that Yugoslavia also join the Pact. On 1 March, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> joined, and the next day, German troops entered Bulgaria from Romania, closing the ring around Yugoslavia.

Further pressure was applied by Hitler on 4 March 1941, when the Yugoslav regent, Prince <a href="Prince%20Paul%20of%20Yugoslavia">Paul</a>, visited Berchtesgaden, but the prince delayed a decision. On 6 March, the <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Army%20Air%20Force">Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force</a> (, VVKJ) was secretly mobilised. The following day, British troops began landing in Greece to bolster the country's defences against the Italians. On 12 March, the VVKJ began dispersing to auxiliary airfields. By 20 March, the VVKJ's dispersal had been completed. Hitler, wishing to secure his southern flank in anticipation of Germany's impending <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">invasion of the Soviet Union</a>, demanded that Yugoslavia sign the Pact. On 25 March, the Yugoslav government <a href="Yugoslav%20accession%20to%20the%20Tripartite%20Pact">complied</a>. Two days later a <a href="Yugoslav%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">military "coup d'état"</a> was carried out by a group of VVKJ and Yugoslav <a href="Royal%20Guard">Royal Guard</a> officers, led by <a href="Brigadier%20General">Brigadier General</a> <a href="Borivoje%20Mirkovi%C4%87">Borivoje Mirković</a>. The prince was deposed and replaced by his 17-year-old nephew <a href="Peter%20II%20of%20Yugoslavia">Peter</a>, who was declared to be of age to accede to the throne.

The same day as the "coup d'état", Hitler issued <a href="Adolf%20Hitler%27s%20directives">Directive 25</a>, which stated that the coup had changed the political situation in the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>. He ordered that "even if Yugoslavia at first should give declarations of loyalty, she must be considered as a foe and therefore must be destroyed as quickly as possible". German reconnaissance aircraft frequently violated Yugoslav airspace in the aftermath of the coup. VVKJ <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighters</a> were placed on constant alert. The German incursions demonstrated that the Yugoslav ground observation post network and supporting radio communications were inadequate. Hitler decided that <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a> would be bombed as punishment for the coup against the government that had signed the Pact, under the codename Operation Retribution ("Unternehmen Strafgericht"). On 27 and 28 March 1941, "<a href="Reichsmarschall">Reichsmarschall</a>" <a href="Hermann%20G%C3%B6ring">Hermann Göring</a> transferred about 500 fighter and bomber aircraft from France and northern Germany to airfields near the Yugoslav border. The commander of <a href="Luftflotte%204">"Luftflotte" IV</a>, "<a href="Generaloberst">Generaloberst</a>" (General) <a href="Alexander%20L%C3%B6hr">Alexander Löhr</a>, allocated these aircraft to attack the Yugoslav capital in waves by day and night. Löhr issued his orders for the bombing on 31 March, but the decision to bomb Belgrade would not be confirmed by Hitler until 5 April. Although Hitler ordered the general destruction of Belgrade, at the last minute Löhr replaced these general directions with specific military objectives within the city.

On 3 April, <a href="Major">Major</a> <a href="Vladimir%20Kren">Vladimir Kren</a> defected to the Germans, flying a <a href="Potez%2025">Potez 25</a> aircraft to <a href="Graz">Graz</a> in Austria, and disclosed the locations of many of Yugoslavia's dispersal airfields, as well as codes used by the VVKJ, which had to be quickly changed. When the invasion commenced, he also pointed out which locations in Belgrade should be targeted. On the afternoon of 5 April, a British <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">colonel</a> visited Mirković at the VVKJ base in <a href="Zemun">Zemun</a> and informed him that the attack on Belgrade would commence at 06:30 the following morning. The previous day, the Yugoslav government had declared Belgrade an <a href="open%20city">open city</a> in the event of hostilities. Although the German embassy had informed its government that Belgrade did not contain any <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft defences</a>, in an effort to justify the attack to the public, German propaganda branded the city "Fortress Belgrade" after the first bombs were dropped. Before the invasion commenced, sources within the Yugoslav <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28Yugoslavia%29">Ministry of Army and Navy</a> advised the Germans of the location of troop mobilisation centres and air-raid shelters in Belgrade.

By 6 April, the VVKJ had been almost completely mobilised, and consisted of four air brigades with more than 423 aircraft of Yugoslav, German, Italian, French, Czech and British design, including 107 modern fighters and 100 modern <a href="medium%20bomber">medium bomber</a>s. Other than a small number of locally made <a href="Rogo%C5%BEarski%20IK-3">Rogožarski IK-3</a> fighters, almost all the modern aircraft available to the VVKJ were of German, Italian or British design for which limited spares and munitions were available. The available aircraft were spread all over the country, and only the 1st Fighter Brigade was near enough to Belgrade to respond to an attack on the capital. In total, the 1st Fighter Brigade fielded 56 <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%20109">Messerschmitt Bf 109</a>E-3a fighters, 15 <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a> MkIs, and six Rogožarski IK-3s.

German ground forces crossed the Yugoslav border at 05:15 on 6 April, and the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Public%20Enlightenment%20and%20Propaganda">Reich Minister of Propaganda</a>, "<a href="Reichsleiter">Reichsleiter</a>" <a href="Joseph%20Goebbels">Joseph Goebbels</a>, announced Germany's declaration of war at 06:00. The invasion and concurrent bombing coincided with <a href="Easter">Easter</a> Sunday as observed by the <a href="Serbian%20Orthodox%20Church">Serbian Orthodox Church</a>, which uses the <a href="Julian%20calendar">Julian calendar</a>. Yugoslav anti-aircraft defences caused a false alarm when they reported the approach of an air raid from the direction of Romania at 03:00, but listening posts on the Romanian border had actually heard the aircraft engines of the Romanian-based "Fliegerführer" Arad warming up well before they took off. The VVKJ's 51st Fighter Group at Zemun had been alerted before dawn, and when reports began to be received about Luftwaffe attacks on VVKJ airfields, the first patrol was sent into the air. At first, no aircraft could be seen approaching Belgrade.

The first wave closed on Belgrade between 06:30 and 06:45, and consisted of 74 <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2087">Junkers Ju 87</a> "Stuka" dive bombers, and 160 <a href="Heinkel%20He%20111">Heinkel He 111</a> medium bombers and <a href="Dornier%20Do%2017">Dornier Do 17</a> <a href="light%20bomber">light bomber</a>s at . They were escorted by <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%20110">Messerschmitt Bf 110</a> <a href="heavy%20fighter">heavy fighter</a>s at and 100 Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters at . The entire Yugoslav 6th Fighter Brigade, consisting of the 51st Fighter Group at Zemun and the 32nd Fighter Group at <a href="Prnjavor%20%28Belgrade%29%23Boroughs">Prnjavor</a>, totalling 29 Messerschmitt Bf 109Es and five Rogožarski IK-3s, were scrambled to intercept the Germans. The Yugoslavs were quickly engaged by escorting Messerschmitt Bf 109Es from <a href="Jagdgeschwader%2077">"Jagdgeschwader" 77</a> (JG 77). Just as the first wave was departing, Hawker Hurricane Mk1s of the 52nd Fighter Group of the 2nd Fighter Regiment based at <a href="Kni%C4%87">Knić</a> arrived over Belgrade and engaged some dive bombers, claiming one "Stuka" shot down. During the first attack, the Yugoslavs claimed fifteen German aircraft shot down and lost five of their own, with six more badly damaged. The pilots of JG 77 claimed ten Yugoslav machines shot down and another six destroyed on the ground. On his return to base, the commander of the 51st Fighter Group was relieved of his command for failure to take action. The first wave hit the Belgrade power station, the <a href="General%20Post%20Office%2C%20Belgrade">post office</a> including telegraph and postal services, the headquarters of the Ministry of Army and Navy, the <a href="Supreme%20Command%20%28Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia%29">Yugoslav Supreme Command</a> building, the <a href="Military%20Academy%20%28Serbia%29">military academy</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Compound%2C%20Belgrade">royal palace at Dedinje</a>, the royal guard barracks at <a href="Top%C4%8Dider">Topčider</a>, the gendarmerie command headquarters, and the airport at Zemun, among other targets.

Immediately after the first wave, King Peter, the Government of Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav Supreme Command left Belgrade and retreated to Yugoslavia's mountainous interior with the intention of going into exile. The second wave of German aircraft arrived over Belgrade about 10:00, consisting of 57 Ju 87 dive bombers and 30 Bf 109E fighters. They were met by 15 of the remaining fighters from the 6th Fighter Brigade. This time the Yugoslavs claimed two dive bombers forced down, and one Bf 109E shot down. A patrol of Bf 109Es from the Yugoslav 31st Fighter Group based at <a href="Kragujevac">Kragujevac</a>, acting without orders from their group commander, followed the Germans as they returned to their bases and claimed two dive bombers shot down for the loss of both Yugoslav aircraft.

Belgrade was targeted on two other occasions on the first day of the invasion. The third wave struck at 14:00, consisting of 94 twin-engined bombers flying from airfields near <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>, escorted by 60 fighters. This wave was met by eighteen fighters of the 6th Fighter Regiment, which claimed four German aircraft. The fourth attack of the day approached Belgrade at 16:00, comprising 97 dive bombers and 60 fighters.

The Germans claimed nineteen Yugoslav Bf 109E fighters and four unidentified aircraft destroyed on 6 April. Actual Yugoslav aircraft losses on the first day were ten shot down and fifteen damaged. The Yugoslavs claimed to have shot down twenty-two German aircraft and forced two others to land. The Germans lost twelve aircraft, significantly fewer than claimed by the Yugoslavs: two Do 17Z light bombers, five Bf 110 heavy fighters, four Ju 87 dive bombers, and one Bf 109E fighter. One Luftwaffe pilot who claimed his first victory over Belgrade on 6 April was "<a href="Oberleutnant">Oberleutnant</a>" <a href="Gerhard%20Koall">Gerhard Koall</a> of <a href="Jagdgeschwader%2054">"Jagdgeschwader" 54</a>. He went on to be credited with 37 victories and was awarded the <a href="Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross">Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross</a> in 1944.

German bombers and dive-bombers dropped of <a href="aerial%20bomb">bombs</a> and <a href="Incendiary%20device">incendiaries</a> on the capital. The weak VVKJ and inadequate anti-aircraft defences of Belgrade briefly attempted to meet the overwhelming Luftwaffe assault, but were eliminated as threats during the first wave of the attack. Sources vary regarding the success achieved by the defenders. A US Army study first published in 1953 states that the Luftwaffe lost two fighter aircraft, downed 20 Yugoslav aircraft and destroyed a further 44 on the ground. The military historian Daniel L. Zajac writes that the Germans lost 40 aircraft during the two-day air battle. Another source indicates the loss of 14 German aircraft on 6 April. Dive-bombers in subsequent waves were able to operate at rooftop altitude.

According to the historian <a href="Stevan%20K.%20Pavlowitch">Stevan K. Pavlowitch</a>, the bombing of Belgrade lasted three days. Other sources state the air battle over Belgrade lasted only two days owing to poor flying conditions on 8 April. The most important cultural institution that was destroyed was the <a href="National%20Library%20of%20Serbia">National Library of Serbia</a>, which was hit by bombs and gutted by fire. Hundreds of thousands of rare books, maps, and <a href="medieval">medieval</a> manuscripts were destroyed. Also struck was the <a href="Belgrade%20Zoo">Belgrade Zoo</a>, sending frightened animals running through the streets.

<a href="No.%2037%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 37 Squadron</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) conducted two bombing raids on <a href="Sofia">Sofia</a>, the capital of Bulgaria, in retaliation for the bombing of Belgrade. Operating <a href="Vickers%20Wellington">Vickers Wellington</a> bombers from an airfield in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Greece">Greece</a>, the squadron conducted raids on 6/7 April and 12/13 April, dropping a total of of high-explosive bombs on railway targets and nearby residential areas. These raids were carried out despite the fact that Britain was not at war with Bulgaria until 12 December 1941. The historian Herman Knell calls the retaliatory justification for these raids "strange and implausible". The aviation historians Shores, Cull and Malizia indicate that these raids were attacks on the lines of communication of German forces attacking Greece and Yugoslavia, and note that the raid on 6/7 April targeted an ammunition train and other installations in Sofia, and the raid on 12/13 April bombed the railway marshalling yards. Other similar targets in Bulgaria were attacked by the RAF during the <a href="Balkans%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Balkans Campaign</a>.

The bombing of Belgrade paralyzed communications between the Yugoslav military and its headquarters, and contributed decisively to the rapid collapse of Yugoslav resistance. Civilian casualties were significant, but sources vary widely from 1,500 to 17,000 killed. They were worsened by the disclosure of air-raid shelter locations to the Germans in the days preceding the attack. The official casualty figure released by the occupation authorities soon after the bombing was 2,271 killed. Other sources mention 5,000 to 10,000 fatalities, and later Yugoslav estimates ranged even higher. The historian <a href="Jozo%20Tomasevich">Jozo Tomasevich</a> writes that the higher estimates were downgraded following "careful postwar investigations", and indicates that a figure between 3,000 and 4,000 is more realistic.

Belgrade was occupied on 13 April 1941 and, four days later, Yugoslavia capitulated. Afterwards, Luftwaffe engineers conducted a bomb damage assessment in Belgrade. The report stated that of bombs were dropped, 10 to 14 percent being incendiaries. It listed all the targets of the bombing, including the royal palace, the war ministry, military headquarters, the central post office, the telegraph office, passenger and goods railway stations, power stations and barracks. It also mentioned that seven aerial mines were dropped, and that areas in the centre and northwest of the city had been destroyed, comprising 20 to 25 percent of its total area. Some aspects of the bombing remain unexplained, particularly the use of the aerial mines. Significant damage was done to Belgrade, particularly to the water and electrical systems. Pavlowitch states that almost 50 percent of housing in Belgrade was destroyed. After the invasion, the Germans forced between 3,500 and 4,000 <a href="Jews">Jews</a> to collect rubble that was caused by the bombing. Unexploded German bombs continue to be unearthed in the 21st century.

Löhr was captured by the <a href="Yugoslav%20Partisans">Yugoslav Partisans</a> on 9 May 1945, escaped, and was recaptured on 13 May. He was intensively interrogated, after which he was tried before a Yugoslav military court on war crimes charges, one of which related to his command of "Luftflotte" IV during Operation Retribution. Löhr was convicted by the Yugoslav military court and sentenced to death. He was executed on 26 February 1947. Following the invasion, Kren was appointed head of the <a href="Air%20Force%20of%20the%20Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia</a> (, ZNDH). He was arrested in Italy in March 1947 and extradited to Yugoslavia, where he was tried on unrelated charges of war crimes for his role in the targeting of civilians by the ZNDH. He was found guilty on all counts and executed in 1948.

The bombing of Belgrade was depicted in the 1980 Yugoslav feature film "<a href="Who%27s%20Singin%27%20Over%20There%3F">Who's Singin' Over There?</a>" () and the 1995 feature film "<a href="Underground%20%281995%20film%29">Underground</a>" (). It is also the subject of <a href="Miodrag%20Pavlovi%C4%87">Miodrag Pavlović</a>'s poem "Belgrade 1941" (). The <a href="Serbian%20American">Serbian American</a> poet <a href="Charles%20Simic">Charles Simic</a>, a survivor of the bombing, wrote a poem titled "Cameo Appearance" recounting his experiences. A monument commemorating the Yugoslav pilots killed during Operation Retribution was inaugurated in <a href="New%20Belgrade">New Belgrade</a> on 6 April 1997. It was designed by the sculptor <a href="Miodrag%20%C5%BDivkovi%C4%87%20%28sculptor%29">Miodrag Živković</a>. On 6 April 2016, the 75th anniversary of the bombing, a memorial service was held for the victims, attended by the Serbian <a href="Ministry%20of%20Labour%2C%20Employment%2C%20Veteran%20and%20Social%20Policy%20%28Serbia%29">Minister for Labour, Employment, Veteran and Social Policy</a>, <a href="Aleksandar%20Vulin">Aleksandar Vulin</a>. In June 2017, it was announced that the site containing the ruined foundations of the National Library of Serbia would be transformed into a memorial garden.

Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo

"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" is the ninth episode of the <a href="South%20Park%20%28season%201%29">first season</a> of the American animated television series "<a href="South%20Park">South Park</a>". It originally aired on <a href="Comedy%20Central">Comedy Central</a> in the United States on December 17, 1997. In the episode, the <a href="Judaism">Jewish</a> character <a href="Kyle%20Broflovski">Kyle</a> feels excluded from the town's celebrations during <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a>, and is comforted by <a href="Mr.%20Hankey">Mr. Hankey</a>, a talking and singing lump of <a href="feces">feces</a> wearing a red hat. Mr. Hankey does not come alive in the presence of other characters, so they think that Kyle is delusional. In another plot strand, the townspeople remove all religious aspects of Christmas from South Park to remain politically correct and inoffensive.

The episode was written and directed by the series' co-creators <a href="Trey%20Parker">Trey Parker</a> and <a href="Matt%20Stone">Matt Stone</a>. The Mr. Hankey character was based on an idea from Parker's childhood; when Parker and Stone conceived the "South Park" series, they wanted to make Mr. Hankey the lead character. Heavily influenced by the "<a href="Peanuts">Peanuts</a>" Christmas special "<a href="A%20Charlie%20Brown%20Christmas">A Charlie Brown Christmas</a>" from 1965, "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" was the first Christmas-themed "South Park" episode, the first musical episode, and the only episode in season one (and therefore the first time in the series) in which <a href="Kenny%20McCormick">Kenny</a> does not die. It was a <a href="satire">satire</a> of political correctness and religious sensitivity.

The episode received generally positive reviews and has been described as one of the classic "South Park" episodes. It was viewed in about 4.5 million households during its original broadcast, the highest <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen rating</a> to that date for "South Park" and the fourth-highest overall for a basic cable entertainment program of 1997. In addition to Mr. Hankey himself, the episode introduced the popular "South Park" songs "A Lonely Jew on Christmas" and "Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat Bitch". <a href="John%20Kricfalusi">John Kricfalusi</a>, the creator of "<a href="The%20Ren%20%26amp%3B%20Stimpy%20Show">The Ren & Stimpy Show</a>", accused Parker and Stone of stealing the idea for Mr. Hankey from him, which the duo vehemently denied.

<a href="Kyle%20Broflovski">Kyle</a> is playing <a href="Saint%20Joseph">Saint Joseph</a> in the South Park Elementary School's Christmas <a href="Nativity%20scene">nativity play</a>, but he is forced to quit when <a href="Gerald%20and%20Sheila%20Broflovski">his mother</a> hears of the play and expresses outrage that her <a href="Judaism">Jewish</a> son is being forced to participate in a <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> production. She demands that the religious elements be taken out of the public school, and threatens to take her case to the mayor. Kyle suggests he could sing the "<a href="Mr.%20Hankey">Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo</a>" song as a non-religious substitute, but his suggestion is rejected because nobody else believes in Mr. Hankey, a living and talking "Christmas poo". Kyle leaves the school feeling lonely and excluded because he cannot celebrate Christmas with everyone else.

<a href="Mayor%20McDaniels">Mayor McDaniels</a> decides that anything offensive to anyone will be removed from the Christmas celebrations, including <a href="Santa%20Claus">Santa Claus</a>, <a href="Christmas%20tree">Christmas tree</a>s, <a href="wreath">wreath</a>s, <a href="fairy%20lights">fairy lights</a>, <a href="candy%20cane">candy cane</a>s, <a href="mistletoe">mistletoe</a> and the <a href="Star%20of%20Bethlehem">Star of Bethlehem</a>. Kyle once again tries to suggest that they use Mr. Hankey as a non-religious Christmas icon since he does not discriminate against anyone. At home, Kyle is scolded by his parents for believing in Mr. Hankey. While Kyle is brushing his teeth, Mr. Hankey comes out of the toilet, spreading feces stains everywhere he goes, prompting Kyle's parents to blame Kyle for the mess. Kyle decides he will bring Mr. Hankey to school to prove he is real, but this only causes more problems as Mr. Hankey disguises himself as an unadorned, dried-out piece of feces when he is around people who do not believe in him, leading <a href="Cartman">Cartman</a> to ask if carrying around boxes with feces in them is some kind of Jewish tradition. Mr. Hankey leaps at Cartman's face as he sings "Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat Bitch" in <a href="D%20Minor">D Minor</a>, and Kyle is blamed. He is sent to talk to guidance counselor, <a href="Mr.%20Mackey">Mr. Mackey</a>, but Kyle only gets into further trouble when Mr. Hankey takes a bath in Mr. Mackey's coffee. Cartman, <a href="Stan%20Marsh">Stan</a> and <a href="Kenny%20McCormick">Kenny</a> believe Kyle is insane and check him into a <a href="mental%20institution">mental institution</a>.

Like the whole town, the school Christmas pageant is stripped of all symbols of Christmas, and the children instead present a <a href="Minimal%20music">minimalist</a> song and dance created by composer <a href="Philip%20Glass">Philip Glass</a>. The parents, astounded by how awful the pageant has turned out, begin blaming one another for destroying Christmas and a fight breaks out. When <a href="Chef%20%28South%20Park%29">Chef</a> finds out where Kyle is, he reveals to the children that Mr. Hankey does actually exist. When all the children start believing, Mr. Hankey finally reveals himself to everyone and scolds them for losing sight of the good things of Christmas and focusing on the bad. The townspeople release Kyle from the asylum and apologize, then they all sing Christmas songs and watch Mr. Hankey fly away with Santa Claus. Cartman, Stan, and Kyle feel that something is still missing. "THE END" then appears, and Kenny is excited and relieved that he has survived the entire episode without getting killed in spite of being involved in dangerous and life-threatening situations throughout. (This would not happen again until "<a href="Rainforest%20Shmainforest">Rainforest Shmainforest</a>.")

During the end credits, <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> dejectedly sings, "<a href="Happy%20Birthday%20to%20You">Happy Birthday</a>" to himself alone in his <a href="Jesus%20and%20Pals">television studio</a>.

The Mr. Hankey character was based on an idea <a href="Trey%20Parker">Trey Parker</a>'s father created when he was toilet-training Trey as a child. Parker said he refused to flush the toilet as a child, so his father told him if he did not flush down his stool, which he called "Mr. Hankey", it would come to life and kill him. The concept stayed with Parker throughout his childhood; starting in elementary school and throughout his entire education, he would often draw the character in class, wearing a sailor's hat instead of the Santa Claus hat he would later wear in "South Park". Parker shared the concept with future "South Park" co-creator <a href="Matt%20Stone">Matt Stone</a> when the two met at the <a href="University%20of%20Colorado%20at%20Boulder">University of Colorado at Boulder</a>, and the duo immediately knew they wanted to create a film or production involving Mr. Hankey. The two discussed filming a three-minute short film involving a boy who befriended the talking stool, but Mr. Hankey would not come alive for anybody else, prompting others to believe the boy was crazy. They planned for the boy's parents to find him holding a stool in the bathroom and blame the child for smearing feces along the walls when it was actually Mr. Hankey's fault; they also planned to have him visit a school counselor, where Mr. Hankey would leap into the counselor's coffee mug and the boy would be blamed. At the end, it would turn out that the boy was indeed crazy and Mr. Hankey was not real at all, but a figment of the boy's imagination. Parker and Stone never made the short film, but practically all of its elements were included in the future "South Park" episode "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo", with the notable exception of the ending.

Although the Mr. Hankey short film was never made, Parker and Stone made two Christmas-related animated short films called "<a href="The%20Spirit%20of%20Christmas%20%28short%20film%29">The Spirit of Christmas</a>", which served as precursors to the "South Park" series. When the shorts began to generate interest for a possible television series, Parker and Stone originally conceived the idea of a "South Park"-like show with four children characters, but with a talking stool named Mr. Hankey as the show's main protagonist; they planned to call it "The Mr. Hankey Show". They pitched the idea to friend <a href="Brian%20Graden">Brian Graden</a>, then a television executive with the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox Broadcasting Company</a>, but he rejected it and said, according to Matt Stone, "I'm not putting poo on my network". Parker and Stone adapted their original idea into a show revolving around the South Park town and four children without Mr. Hankey as a protagonist, but they planned to revive the character as a minor supporting role in a future episode. Later, when <a href="Comedy%20Central">Comedy Central</a> expressed interest in the series, Parker and Stone brought up the idea of a Mr. Hankey episode during negotiations with the network executives. Parker claimed during a meeting, he said, "One thing we have to know before we really go any further: how do you feel about talking poo?" The executives were receptive to the idea, which Parker said was one of the main reasons he and Stone decided to sign on with the channel.

The elements of the episode involving Kyle's loneliness as a Jew during Christmas were inspired by Parker and Stone's perceptions of Jews growing up in Colorado during their childhood. Although the two went to different schools, they both witnessed Jewish children get beat up and bullied because both of their schools had very few Jewish students to begin with; although Stone himself is Jewish, he was not raised as a practicing Jew and so he did not experience much of the bullying himself firsthand. The unsuccessful efforts by the South Park Elementary School in the episode to include people of non-Christian denomination were inspired by similarly failed attempts Parker and Stone witnessed growing up. Parker cited as an example a chorus concert in which the single Jewish student was asked to sing her own <a href="Hanukkah">Hanukkah</a> song while everybody else sang Christmas songs; although the idea was to make the student feel special, Parker said it only made her feel more lonely and isolated.

"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" was written and directed by Parker and Stone, and first aired in the United States on <a href="Comedy%20Central">Comedy Central</a> on December 17, 1997. It was the first official "South Park" Christmas episode. Television journalists said the "Spirit of Christmas" shorts were precursors to Mr. Hankey and that they shared some common traits, but that the television episode was considered tamer and more tasteful. Parker and Stone originally conceived the episode "<a href="Damien%20%28South%20Park%29">Damien</a>", which involves a boxing match between Jesus and <a href="Satan">Satan</a>, as the first season's Christmas episode. Although they had long planned to feature Mr. Hankey in the show, they did not decide to make him a Christmas character until halfway through the filming of "Damien". Once they made the decision, they decided to make "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" the holiday episode instead; although it would not air until after the "Mr. Hankey" episode, Parker and Stone finished production of "Damien" before working on "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo".

At the time they were writing the episode, Parker and Stone had seen a large number of news reports about government buildings refusing to allow the display of models of the <a href="nativity%20scene">nativity scene</a> and other <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> holiday symbols, in an effort not to offend other religions. Parker and Stone, as two <a href="agnosticism">agnostics</a> who still appreciated the Christmas holiday, said they felt the idea was "ridiculous" and, according to Stone, "We just wanted Mr. Hankey to say Christmas was about good and about presents, and it doesn't have to be this religious [controversy]." The two sought to write an episode in the tradition of old classic Christmas specials with their own irreverent "South Park" twist, and so they watched the famous 1965 "<a href="Peanuts">Peanuts</a>" special, "<a href="A%20Charlie%20Brown%20Christmas">A Charlie Brown Christmas</a>", repeatedly during the production process. Parker said, "At this point, we just sort of wanted to do a Charlie Brown Christmas "South Park" version. That [special] was definitely a huge part of my life growing up."

The episode was considered the first "South Park" musical episode, and included such songs as "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo", "A Lonely Jew on Christmas" and "Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat Bitch". Parker and Stone were initially concerned about making a musical because, Parker said, "The general rule was people hated musicals". For the Mr. Hankey character, Parker and Stone adapted most of the elements from the Mr. Hankey short film they planned in college, except that Mr. Hankey would prove to be real, not a figment of Kyle's imagination. Parker said this was decided because of his frustration with the character <a href="Aloysius%20Snuffleupagus">Mr. Snuffleupagus</a> in the children's show "<a href="Sesame%20Street">Sesame Street</a>"; for his first 14 years on the show, Mr. Snuffleupagus was an imaginary character seen only by <a href="Big%20Bird">Big Bird</a>, which Parker said "really bummed me out". Parker and Stone felt Mr. Hankey should embody the wholesomeness and morals of cartoons from the 1930s, so they designed him to resemble the version of <a href="Mickey%20Mouse">Mickey Mouse</a> in the 1928 cartoon "<a href="Steamboat%20Willie">Steamboat Willie</a>", particularly in his eyes. For the scenes in which Mr. Hankey smears feces wherever he walks, the animators scanned images of spread out chocolate and fudge and inserted those images into the episode. Parker and Stone had trouble deciding on a voice for Mr. Hankey, but Stone said it came to him while eating a <a href="McMuffin">Sausage McMuffin</a> at a <a href="McDonald%27s">McDonald's</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, while taking a break from promoting "South Park" to the press.

Although Comedy Central did not object to most aspects of the episode, they did require some edits to material they deemed potentially offensive. During rehearsal for a <a href="Nativity%20play">Nativity play</a>, a <a href="Child%20Jesus">baby Jesus</a> resembling a <a href="fetus">fetus</a> pops out of Wendy, who is playing the <a href="Mary%20%28mother%20of%20Jesus%29">Virgin Mary</a>, and is caught by Kyle, who is portraying Joseph of Nazareth. Although the scene was ultimately kept in the episode, Comedy Central executives had problems with it and Parker said they had to handle its animation "very carefully". Additionally, during filming of the live-action Mr. Hankey commercial, the baby originally held the Mr. Hankey stool and took a bite out of it. Comedy Central officials would not allow the scene in the episode and it was changed to portray the idea that the baby had already eaten the stool off-camera, which Parker said he felt was actually funnier.

"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" is the first episode in which Kenny was not killed. Parker and Stone deliberately included several scenes that looked like they might lead to Kenny's death, but they decided because it was Christmas that they would not kill him (though he would later go on to be killed in several subsequent Christmas episodes). The episode was also the first time <a href="Herbert%20Garrison">Mr. Garrison</a> was portrayed as an <a href="antisemitism">anti-semite</a> and <a href="racism">racist</a>, particularly when he asks <a href="List%20of%20recurring%20South%20Park%20characters%23Mayor%20McDaniels">Mayor McDaniels</a> if she can get rid of all the <a href="Mexico">Mexicans</a> in "South Park". Parker said this decision was made because, "Garrison at that point had already shown himself to be the most messed up person in the entire town, and there's obviously so much wrong with him mentally. A person that disturbed being a racist is funny to us."

"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" was released, along with 11 other episodes, in a three-<a href="DVD">DVD</a> set in November 1998. It was included in the third volume, which also included the episodes "<a href="Starvin%27%20Marvin%20%28South%20Park%29">Starvin' Marvin</a>", "<a href="Mecha-Streisand">Mecha-Streisand</a>" and "<a href="Tom%27s%20Rhinoplasty">Tom's Rhinoplasty</a>". "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" was also one of six episodes included on a 1998 <a href="VHS">VHS</a> called "South Park Festival Special", which included "Starvin' Marvin", "<a href="Merry%20Christmas%2C%20Charlie%20Manson%21">Merry Christmas, Charlie Manson!</a>", "<a href="Mr.%20Hankey%27s%20Christmas%20Classics">Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics</a>", "<a href="Korn%27s%20Groovy%20Pirate%20Ghost%20Mystery">Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery</a>" and "<a href="Pinkeye%20%28South%20Park%29">Pinkeye</a>". It was later released in the November 2007 DVD release "Christmas Time in South Park", which also included the episodes, "Merry Christmas, Charlie Manson!", "Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics", "<a href="A%20Very%20Crappy%20Christmas">A Very Crappy Christmas</a>", "<a href="Red%20Sleigh%20Down">Red Sleigh Down</a>", "<a href="It%27s%20Christmas%20in%20Canada">It's Christmas in Canada</a>" and "<a href="Woodland%20Critter%20Christmas">Woodland Critter Christmas</a>". The episode, along with the other 12 from the first season, was also included in the DVD release "South Park: The Complete First Season", which was released on November 12, 2002. Parker and Stone recorded commentary track for each episode, but they were not included with the DVDs due to "standards" issues with some of the statements; Parker and Stone refused to allow the tracks to be edited and censored, so they were released in a CD completely separately from the DVDs.

Songs from "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" were featured in the October 2007 <a href="compact%20disc">CD</a> soundtrack release called "Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics". "<a href="The%20Birmingham%20News">The Birmingham News</a>" said the album "gleefully tramples on one of America's most cherished holidays [and] will likely make even cynical listeners gasp".

"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" is a <a href="satire">satire</a> on <a href="political%20correctness">political correctness</a> and religious sensitivity, particularly in its portrayal of the characters organizing "The Happy, Non-Offensive, Non-Denominational Christmas Play" to avoid offending anyone of any religious backgrounds. While many Christmas specials focus on the religious, spiritual and moral values of the Christmas holiday rather than the commercial aspects, "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" actually embraces <a href="commercialism">commercialism</a> in Christmas, suggesting viewers should enjoy those elements of the holiday without taking religion too seriously. <a href="York%20University">York University</a> Professor Alison Halsall said of this aspect of the episode, "Again, Parker and Stone blur the sacred and the profane, in this instance, to gut holidays of their traditional meanings."

The episode has also been described as simultaneously embracing and <a href="parody">parody</a>ing animated Christmas specials like "A Charlie Brown Christmas", "<a href="Frosty%20the%20Snowman%20%28TV%20program%29">Frosty the Snowman</a>" and "<a href="It%27s%20the%20Great%20Pumpkin%2C%20Charlie%20Brown">It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown</a>". It has also been described as a commentary on the way <a href="Judaism">Jewish</a> children are overlooked during the Christmas holiday; this theme is overtly stated by Stan, who says at the end of the episode that Jews and Hanukkah "can be cool" as well as Christmas. M. Keith Booker, author of "Drawn to Television: Prime-Time Animation from The Flintstones to Family Guy", said although the episode is irreverent in its treatment of Christmas, "even if spearheaded by a singing turd, [it] is about as close as "South Park" ever comes to being sentimental and nostalgic". Literary critic Mark Caldwell said the fact that Kenny survived the episode demonstrates the episode's "strong, albeit dutifully ironic, undercurrent of conventional holiday decency."

Alison Halsall said "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" is the strongest example of a history of <a href="scatology">scatology</a>, the study of excrement, throughout the "South Park" series. Halsall said the use of fecal matter as a character, and especially its tendency to smear parts of itself around as it moved, directly confronts the viewer with "the inherent dirtiness of the human body, no matter how much we try to aestheticize it, Mr. Hankey's stains systematically mess up the cleanliness of the social order. [...] "South Park" refuses sanitization through the gross-out factor."

Some writers consider Mr. Hankey one of the most easily recognizable and popular of the non-regular "South Park" characters. His high-pitched greeting, "Howdy-ho", was equally recognizable and became one of the most quoted lines from the show's first season. Several fan websites were made about the character within months of the episode's broadcast. In January 1998, "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" reported that Comedy Central executives had plans to produce a Mr. Hankey <a href="candy%20bar">chocolate bar</a>. Larry Lieberman, the channel's vice president of strategic planning and new business development, said a sketch of a Mr. Hankey candy bar was drawn and circulated, but mainly as a joke; he said no serious discussions were held about producing such an item. A stuffed Mr. Hankey became one of the most popular "South Park" tie-in products of the 1998 Christmas season.

In addition to the title character, "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" included the first appearances of characters <a href="Father%20Maxi">Father Maxi</a> and <a href="Mr.%20Mackey">Mr. Mackey</a>. Both characters appeared in "Damien", which was produced before "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo", but the Christmas episode aired first. Mr. Mackey was inspired by Parker's real-life school guidance counselor; Parker, who provides the voice for Mackey, said the real-life counselor was similarly thin and wiry and that Parker's voice for Mr. Mackey is an exact, unexaggerated version of how his counselor spoke.

"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" includes several references to the "Peanuts" holiday special, "A Charlie Brown Christmas". A Christmas pageant features the same biblical quote spoken by <a href="Linus%20van%20Pelt">Linus</a> in that special; additionally, the music featured in the pageant is very similar to the "Peanuts" special's musical score by <a href="Vince%20Guaraldi">Vince Guaraldi</a>, and the South Park kids go outside to catch falling snowflakes on their tongues in the same way as in the special.

A doctor prescribes <a href="Prozac">Prozac</a>, a real life <a href="antidepressant">antidepressant</a>, to Kyle for his apparent love for feces, which he describes as "fecalphilia", a condition perhaps better known by the medical term <a href="coprophilia">coprophilia</a>. Composer <a href="Philip%20Glass">Philip Glass</a> composes the avant-garde musical score for the non-denominational Christmas play. Stone and Parker both strongly dislike Glass; Parker, who was a music major in college, said, "I really thought you could basically tell a third grader to sit down at a keyboard and mess around and sell it as a Philip Glass album, and no one would know the difference." The do-it-yourself kit in the live action commercial, in which families can make their own Mr. Hankey, is similar to the <a href="Mr.%20Potato%20Head">Mr. Potato Head</a> toy set.

<a href="Slack%20%28software%29">Slack</a>, the popular messaging software, also uses the word "hankey" as a shortcut for the <a href="Pile%20of%20Poo%20emoji">Pile of Poo emoji</a>.

Although Parker and Stone credit "<a href="Big%20Gay%20Al%27s%20Big%20Gay%20Boat%20Ride">Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride</a>" as helping elevate the series, they felt "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" elevated "South Park" to a new level of popularity and relevance. Parker said of it, "This was the episode that just vaulted everything." Following the success of "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo", a large number of celebrities started contacting Comedy Central with the hopes of making guest appearances in "South Park" episodes. This allowed Parker and Stone to practically take their pick of guest stars, and led to appearances by <a href="Natasha%20Henstridge">Natasha Henstridge</a> in "<a href="Tom%27s%20Rhinoplasty">Tom's Rhinoplasty</a>" and <a href="Robert%20Smith%20%28musician%29">Robert Smith</a> in "<a href="Mecha-Streisand">Mecha-Streisand</a>". Stone said although "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" has become less shocking with time, viewers at the time of the episode's original broadcast were shocked, and some were horrified, at the idea of a living and speaking Christmas stool. "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" was the fourth-highest overall basic cable entertainment program of 1997. In its original American broadcast, the episode received a <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen Rating</a> of 5.4, meaning the episode was seen by about 4.5 million households. The rating was the highest yet for "South Park", and was more than seven times the Comedy Central prime-time average. The episode also earned a 51 share of the male demographic aged between 18 and 24; a share represents the percentage of households using a television at the time the program is airing.

"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" has been described as one of the classic episodes of "South Park". Chris Vognar of "<a href="The%20Dallas%20Morning%20News">The Dallas Morning News</a>" described Mr. Hankey himself as "the most outrageous character yet on TV's most outrageous show". Charlie Patton of "<a href="The%20Florida%20Times-Union">The Florida Times-Union</a>" said the episode was "crude, nasty, irreverent and generally offensive—also extremely funny". He also said of the Mr. Hankey character, "If you're the sort of person who didn't care for that scene in "<a href="Trainspotting%20%28film%29">Trainspotting</a>" where the <a href="Ewan%20McGregor">Ewan McGregor</a> character dove down the toilet and into the sewer in pursuit of his lost suppository, the whole Mr. Hankey subplot is going to be deeply disturbing." Doug Pratt, a <a href="DVD">DVD</a> reviewer and "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" contributor, said, "Technically, the Christmas episode might well be the show's best effort, artistically, because it tackles the PC-ification of Christmas head-on, and also has an interesting psychological subtext: does the hero actually see Mr. Hankey, or does he have some serious psychological problems?" Diane Werts of "<a href="Newsday">Newsday</a>" said of the episode, "It's gross. It's yucky. It's probably offensive. It's also possibly the funniest holiday episode anybody's airing this year." Werts particularly praised the song "A Lonely Jew on Christmas". Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock, author of "Taking South Park Seriously", said, "This episode arguably pushes the boundaries of what is acceptable, both for Christmas specials and television in general, farther than any previous one." Weinstock said this was particularly true of the episode's fake live-action commercial.

Before the episode was released, <a href="Debbie%20Liebling">Debbie Liebling</a>, then-Comedy Central vice president of development and production, herself described the episode as "adorably offensive". Alan Sepinwall of "<a href="The%20Star-Ledger">The Star-Ledger</a>" called the episode "a brilliant skewering" of political correctness and over-sensitivity, and called it "at once hilariously satiric and extraordinarily foul." Sepinwall also added Mr. Hankey to his 1997 list of most memorable TV moments, describing the character as the year's "most disturbing cartoon image" and as "a mythical holiday creature so bizarre and offensive it literally cannot be described in a family newspaper". Matt Roush of "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" praised the episode, which he described as "ribald, raunchy and riotous". A.J. Jacobs of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" said in January 1998 that the episode was "already infamous". Jacobs also said Mr. Hankey was so popular, he half-jokingly suggested Matt Stone and Trey Parker pursue a <a href="spin-off%20%28media%29">spin-off</a> revolving around the character.

The music in "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" was also praised. "A Lonely Jew on Christmas" has been described as a "classic song", and "Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat Bitch", which reviewers described as one of Cartman's trademarks, was included in the 1999 "South Park" film, "". Not all reviews of "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" were positive. Rick Marin of "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" described the episode as "simply one long potty joke". Virginia Rohan of "<a href="The%20Record%20%28Bergen%20County%29">The Record</a>" said he liked Kyle's song and some of Kenny's antics, but said the episode was not as funny as "The Spirit of Christmas" shorts. Rohan said "South Park" "can be brilliantly over the edge, but often tonight, it sorely needs a comic bungee cord".

In 2003, the <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>-based "<a href="RedEye">RedEye</a>" ranked "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" the greatest "South Park" episode. In October 2004, the Comedy Central website held a poll to determine the top 27 "South Park" episodes for a television marathon; "Mr Hankey, the Christmas Poo" came third, just behind "<a href="Good%20Times%20with%20Weapons">Good Times with Weapons</a>" at #2 and "<a href="Fat%20Butt%20and%20Pancake%20Head">Fat Butt and Pancake Head</a>" at #1. "South Park Studios", the official "South Park" website, listed "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" at number four on its list of the Five Most Notorious Episodes.

<a href="John%20Kricfalusi">John Kricfalusi</a>, the creator of "<a href="The%20Ren%20%26amp%3B%20Stimpy%20Show">The Ren & Stimpy Show</a>", claimed the Mr. Hankey concept was stolen from his cartoon short, "Nutty the Friendly Dump", which was part of a cartoon book series viewable online. Kricfalusi even confirmed that he pitched the idea for an animated series of "Nutty the Friendly Dump" to Comedy Central, who turned it down. Kricfalusi said after the show aired, "I got nine or 10 messages from friends screaming, 'I can't believe this! They totally stole your story!' ... This idea of [feces] singing or dancing and being friends, well, that is my idea." Kricfalusi said he felt other elements of "South Park" were lifted from his work, and he told media outlets his company <a href="Sp%C3%BCmc%C3%B8">Spümcø</a> was contemplating taking legal action against Parker and Stone. Comedy Central spokesman Tony Fox said Stone and Parker were not familiar with "Nutty the Friendly Dump" and that the claim was "ludicrous". Parker said he had never seen more than half an episode of "Ren & Stimpy", which he said he did not enjoy because the characters were too over-the-top and the voice acting was too annoying. Parker said Kricfalusi eventually contacted the "South Park" creators: "He wrote a letter back saying, 'Oh, OK, I see how it could just be a coincidence, but you should just admit to the press that you're a big "Ren and Stimpy" fan.' — I'm not a "Ren and Stimpy" fan."

Russian battleship Retvizan

Retvizan () was a <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a> built before the <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">Russo-Japanese War</a> of 1904–05 for the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Navy">Imperial Russian Navy</a>. She was built by the American <a href="William%20Cramp%20%26amp%3B%20Sons">William Cramp & Sons</a> because Russian shipyards were already at full capacity. Named after a Swedish <a href="ship%20of%20the%20line">ship of the line</a> that was captured during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Vyborg%20Bay%20%281790%29">battle of Vyborg Bay</a> in 1790 (, meaning both "fairness" and "justice"), "Retvizan" was briefly assigned to the <a href="Baltic%20Fleet">Baltic Fleet</a>, but was transferred to the <a href="Far%20East">Far East</a> in 1902.

The ship was torpedoed during the Japanese surprise attack on <a href="L%C3%BCshunkou">Port Arthur</a> during the night of 8/9 February 1904 and <a href="Ship%20grounding">grounded</a> in the harbour entrance when she attempted to take refuge inside, as her <a href="draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> had significantly deepened from the amount of water she had taken aboard after the torpedo hit. She was refloated and repaired in time to join the rest of the <a href="Pacific%20Fleet%20%28Russia%29">1st Pacific Squadron</a> when they attempted to reach <a href="Vladivostok">Vladivostok</a> through the Japanese blockade on 10 August. The Japanese battle fleet engaged them again in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Yellow%20Sea">Battle of the Yellow Sea</a>, forcing most of the Russian ships to return to Port Arthur after their <a href="squadron%20%28naval%29">squadron</a> commander was killed and his <a href="flagship">flagship</a> damaged. "Retvizan" was sunk by Japanese <a href="howitzer">howitzer</a>s in December after the Japanese gained control of the heights around the harbour.

The Japanese <a href="marine%20salvage">raised</a> and repaired "Retvizan" after Port Arthur surrendered in January 1905. She was commissioned into the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> as in 1908. Based in <a href="Sasebo%2C%20Nagasaki">Sasebo</a> when the Japanese declared war on <a href="German%20Empire">Germany</a> in 1914, the ship was sent to reinforce the weak British squadron off <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, but diverted to <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> after reports of a German <a href="gunboat">gunboat</a> there. "Hizen" was unsuccessfully sent to search for other German ships after the Americans interned the gunboat in November. After <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> she supported the Japanese <a href="Siberian%20Intervention">intervention</a> in the <a href="Russian%20Civil%20War">Russian Civil War</a> and was disarmed in 1922 in accordance with the terms of the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a>. The ship was sunk as a gunnery target in 1924.

<a href="Tsar">Tsar</a> <a href="Nicholas%20II%20of%20Russia">Nicholas II</a> had desired a <a href="warm-water%20port">warm-water port</a> on the Pacific since his accession to the throne in 1894. He achieved this ambition in March 1898 when Russia signed a 25-year lease for Port Arthur and the <a href="Liaotung%20Peninsula">Liaotung Peninsula</a> with China. Japan had previously forced China to sign over the port and its surrounding territory as part of <a href="Treaty%20of%20Shimonoseki">the treaty</a> that concluded the <a href="First%20Sino-Japanese%20War">First Sino-Japanese War</a> of 1894–95, but the <a href="Triple%20Intervention">Triple Intervention</a> of France, Russia, and Germany forced them to return the port in exchange for a sizeable increase in the indemnity paid by the Chinese. Japan invested much of the indemnity money in expanding its fleet, while Russia began a major building programme ("For the Needs of the Far East") to defend its newly acquired port.

Russian shipyards were already at maximum capacity so the Naval Ministry decided to order ships from abroad. <a href="Charles%20Henry%20Cramp">Charles Henry Cramp</a>, the owner and son of the founder of <a href="William%20Cramp%20%26amp%3B%20Sons">William Cramp & Sons</a> in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, had a relationship with the Imperial Russian Navy dating back to the late 1870s when his firm built the auxiliary cruisers , , and . Cramp also repaired several Russian warships visiting America in 1893, and he cultivated the contacts he made in the Russian Navy throughout the 1890s. As such, he was ideally positioned to offer to build a battleship for the Russians in his shipyard when they began to look abroad.

Preliminary design work on a battleship intended to equal the latest Japanese ships was begun over the winter of 1897–98 by the Naval Technical Committee although the displacement was limited to for economic reasons. The basic design was that of the with its speed increased to using only two shafts and its steaming range increased to at . The Naval Ministry intended to conduct an international design competition with the ships being built abroad as the Baltic shipyards were at full capacity already.

Cramp's contacts kept him informed of the Russians' intentions and he sailed to <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a> to offer his services and design expertise in March 1898. Initially Cramp offered American designs to the Russians, including an updated version of as it was a relatively close match for the Russian specification, but the Russians preferred their own designs. Both sides compromised and the final design was based on the . The new ship had four fewer guns, but twice the coal capacity for improved range and a longer, slightly narrower hull for more speed. The contract was signed on 23 April 1898 for a price of $4,360,000. The <a href="protected%20cruiser">protected cruiser</a> was ordered at the same time for $2,138,000.

"Retvizan" was <a href="length%20at%20the%20waterline">long at the waterline</a> and long <a href="length%20overall">overall</a>. She had a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a draft of . The ship displaced at normal load. Her hull was subdivided by fourteen transverse <a href="watertight%20compartment">watertight</a> <a href="bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkhead</a>s; in addition a longitudinal centreline bulkhead divided the engine room. "Retvizan" had a complete <a href="double%20bottom">double bottom</a> that extended up the side to the lower edge of the armour <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a>. She had a <a href="metacentric%20height">metacentric height</a> of . Her crew consisted of 23 officers and 722 enlisted men.

"Retvizan" had two three-cylinder vertical <a href="Marine%20steam%20engine%23Triple%20or%20multiple%20expansion">triple-expansion steam engines</a> with a total designed output of . The Russian Navy preferred to use <a href="Belleville%20boiler">Belleville boiler</a>s, but Cramp pressed for <a href="Niclausse%20boiler">Niclausse boiler</a>s, not least because he was the American agent for them, and was supported by the <a href="General%20Admiral">General Admiral</a> <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Alexei%20Alexandrovich%20of%20Russia">Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich</a>. Twenty-four Niclausse-type boilers provided steam to the engines at a working pressure of . On <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s, the engines produced and a top speed of , just under the contract speed of 18 knots. Not surprisingly, Cramp claimed that she reached 18.01 knots to avoid contractual penalties. Following "Retvizan"s arrival in Russia, the propeller pitch was adjusted and she exceeded 18 knots. She carried a normal load of of coal that provided a range of at a speed of and a maximum load of that gave at the same speed.

"Retvizan"s armament was built by the <a href="Obukhov%20State%20Plant">Obukhov Works</a> in Saint Petersburg and shipped to America for installation. The main armament consisted of two pairs of <a href="Russian%2012%20inch%2040%20caliber%20naval%20gun">12-inch</a> 40-<a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">calibre</a> guns mounted in French-style electrically-operated centre-pivot twin <a href="turret">turret</a>s fore and aft. These guns had a maximum elevation of +15° and could depress to -5°. The ship carried 77 rounds per gun and the guns could fire one <a href="Cartridge%20%28firearms%29">round</a> every 80 to 90 seconds. They fired a shell at a <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of to a range of .

Eight of the twelve <a href="152%20mm%2045%20caliber%20Pattern%201892">45-calibre 6-inch</a> <a href="Canet%20guns">Canet Pattern</a> 1892 <a href="quick-firing%20gun">quick-firing (QF) guns</a> were mounted in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s on the main deck while four were mounted on the upper deck. They fired shells that weighed with a muzzle velocity of . They had a maximum range of around and could fire three to five rounds per minute. The guns were provided with 200 rounds each.

The ship carried many smaller guns to defend itself against attack by <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s. The largest of these were twenty QF <a href="75mm%2050%20caliber%20Pattern%201892">Canet Pattern 1892</a> guns. Fourteen of these were in embrasures on the main deck and six were mounted on the upper deck, between the six-inch casemates. Each gun was provided with 325 rounds. They fired an shell at a muzzle velocity of to a maximum range of . The rate of fire was between twelve and fifteen rounds per minute. A total of twenty-four <a href="QF%203-pounder%20Hotchkiss"></a> <a href="Hotchkiss%20gun">Hotchkiss gun</a>s were carried; four in each <a href="Top%20%28sailing%20ship%29">fighting top</a> and eight at each end of the superstructure. They fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of . Six Hotchkiss guns were mounted in the <a href="bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a> wings. They fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of .

"Retvizan" carried six <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s. Four were above water, one each in the bow and stern and the aft pair of <a href="broadside">broadside</a> tubes; the forward broadside tubes were underwater. A total of 17 torpedoes were carried. The ship was designed to carry two second-class torpedo boats each equipped with a single torpedo tube and a small quick-firing gun. The ship could also carry 45 <a href="Naval%20mine">mines</a>.

The ship was fitted with Liuzhol <a href="Stadiametric%20rangefinding">stadiametric rangefinders</a> that used the angle between two vertical points on an enemy ship, usually the waterline and the <a href="crow%27s%20nest">crow's nest</a>, to estimate the range. The gunnery officer consulted his references to get the range and calculated the proper elevation and <a href="deflection%20%28ballistics%29">deflection</a> required to hit the target. He transmitted his commands via a Geisler electro-mechanical <a href="Fire-control%20system%23Naval%20fire%20control">fire-control transmission system</a> to each gun or turret.

The total weight of the <a href="Krupp%20armour">Krupp armour</a> was or 25.8% of the displacement. The armour was mostly made in the United States, although a contract was let for deck armour from Russia on 6 January 1899. The main <a href="waterline">waterline</a> <a href="Belt%20armor">belt</a> had a maximum thickness of and tapered to thick at its lower edge. It was long and high, of which about was above the waterline. The 6-inch upper belt was as long as the main belt and was high. Armour plates thick protected the ends of the ship to a height equal to that of the main and upper belts combined. Bulkheads thick provided transverse protection for the ship's vitals. The lower casemate armour was thick and armour screens thick separated each gun. The upper casemate armour consisted of five inches of armour plate with semicircular 1.5-inch thick <a href="gun%20shield">gun shield</a>s enclosing the guns.

The front and sides of the turrets were thick with 2-inch roofs. Their <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s were thick above the upper deck, but diminished to below it. The <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> and its communication tube had walls. The armour deck inside the central citadel was level with the top of the main belt and sloped down to meet the lower edge of the main belt. It was two inches thick on the flat and on the slope. Fore and aft of the citadel the deck thickened to to the ends of the ship and reinforced the <a href="Naval%20ram">ram</a> bow.

Named after the Swedish <a href="ship%20of%20the%20line">ship of the line</a> "Rättvisan" (Justice) which was captured by the Russians at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Vyborg%20Bay%20%281790%29">Battle of Viborg Bay</a> in 1790, "Retvizan" was ordered on 2 May 1898 for delivery in thirty months. The detailed sketch design was forwarded at the end of 1898 to Saint Petersburg for approval and work commenced on the ship around that time, although she was not officially laid down until 29 July 1899 as yard number 300. Construction was delayed by a strike at the shipyard that began in August 1899 and continued until the strike collapsed in early 1900. Other delays were caused by differences between American and Russian shipbuilding techniques and the insistence of the Naval Ministry on approving any design changes even though a Russian commission had been sent to Philadelphia to supervise her construction.

Her armament arrived in Philadelphia missing electrical cables and with incomplete documentation, which required Cramp's electricians to piece things together themselves, for which Cramp charged an extra $50,000. She was launched on 23 October 1900 and ran her acceptance trials in October 1901. The trials were successful but revealed incomplete work that Cramp had to finish before he received his last payment. More work needed to be done on the armament, but it had to wait until she arrived in Russia. "Retvizan" was accepted on 23 March 1902, under the command of <a href="Captain%20%28naval%29">Captain</a> <a href="Eduard%20Schensnovich">Eduard Schensnovich</a> who commanded her throughout her Russian service.
"Retvizan" sailed for the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> on 13 May 1902 and stopped to re-coal in <a href="Cherbourg">Cherbourg</a>, France en route. After leaving Cherbourg a boiler tube burst on 14 June, scalding six stokers, three of them fatally. After her arrival she was fitted with radio equipment and took part in a <a href="naval%20review">naval review</a> in <a href="Tallinn">Reval</a> staged for the state visit of <a href="Wilhelm%20II%2C%20German%20Emperor">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a> of Germany in August. Later that month she tested an experimental system for coaling at sea; it was deemed successful, but her equipment was removed before she sailed for the Pacific. "Retvizan" departed on 13 November 1902 in company with the battleship and the <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s , and ; she arrived at Port Arthur on 4 May 1903.

The Pacific Squadron began <a href="wikt%3Amoor">mooring</a> in the outer harbour at night as tensions with Japan increased, in order to react more quickly to any Japanese attempt to land troops in Korea. Both Russia and Japan had ambitions to control both <a href="Manchuria">Manchuria</a> and Korea which naturally caused problems between them. A further issue was the Russian failure to withdraw its troops from Manchuria in October 1903. Japan had begun negotiations to reduce the tensions in 1901, but the Russian government was slow and uncertain in its replies because it had not yet decided exactly how to resolve the problems. Japan interpreted this as deliberate prevarications designed to buy time to complete the Russian armament programs. The final straws were news of Russian timber concessions in northern Korea and the Russian refusal to acknowledge Japanese interests in Manchuria while continuing to place conditions on Japanese activities in Korea. These caused the Japanese government to decide in December 1903 that war was now inevitable.

"Retvizan" was on searchlight duty on the night of 8/9 February 1904 and attracted many torpedoes during the Japanese surprise attack that night. She was hit on the port side forward by a torpedo which blew a hole in her side. Five men in the torpedo compartment were killed and all electrical power was knocked out. The ship took on enough water to give her a <a href="list%20%28watercraft%29">list</a> of 11°; this was reduced to 5° by counter-flooding. A sail was used to cover the hole and steam was raised so she could head for the inner harbour. The of water she had taken aboard had increased her draft enough to cause her to ground in the harbour entrance. She was not refloated until 8 March, but played an important role in the meantime in defeating a Japanese attempt to seal the entrance with <a href="block%20ship">block ship</a>s on 23–24 February. Repairs began immediately after she was towed into the harbour and were completed on 3 June although no docks were available and a <a href="cofferdam">cofferdam</a> had to be built. She sailed with the rest of the Russian squadron on 23 June in an abortive attempt to reach <a href="Vladivostok">Vladivostok</a>. <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Wilgelm%20Vitgeft">Vitgeft</a> returned to Port Arthur when he encountered the Japanese fleet, led by Admiral <a href="T%C5%8Dg%C5%8D%20Heihachir%C5%8D">Tōgō Heihachirō</a>, shortly before sunset as he did not wish to engage the numerically superior Japanese in a night battle.

During the summer, "Retvizan" landed two 6-inch, two 47 mm and six 37 mm guns to reinforce the landward defences of the port. She was hit on 9 August by seven shells fired by a battery with a narrow view of the harbour. Schensnovich was slightly wounded, a barge adjacent to the ship was sunk and she was holed below the waterline. The ship took on a 1° list from of water, which was corrected by counter-flooding. The holes were patched, although the water was not pumped out, and she sailed the next day with the fleet in another attempt to reach Vladivostok. This sortie resulted in the Battle of the Yellow Sea.

The battle began as a long-range gunnery duel, during which the Russian ships hit the Japanese ships numerous times and forced Tōgō to temporarily disengage. Over two hours after the start of the battle, the Japanese fleet closed the range and started shooting again at 17:35. Forty minutes later a shell struck "Retzivan"s forward turret near the <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23G">gun ports</a>, killing one turret crewman and wounding six others from the blast pressure. The impact knocked one 12-inch shell off its loading tray, crushing two other sailors and also setting fire to the canvas covering the gun ports. Fearing that the fire might spread, the surviving crewmen flooded the turret, knocking out its electrical system. The crew was able to get the turret partially functional within an hour.
At approximately 18:40 hours on 10 August, during the final phase of the battle, the Russian <a href="flagship">flagship</a> was hit by 12-inch shells which killed Admiral Vitgeft and his immediate staff. The Russian battleship was turning out of control, disrupting the Russian formation. As the Japanese pre-dreadnoughts continued to pound the "Tsesarevich" with their 12-inch fire, "Retzivan"s captain boldly charged Tōgō's battleline in an attempt to divert the Japanese shellfire onto his ship. The Japanese battle line immediately shifted their fire onto the oncoming "Retzivan", firing so many shells that they were unable to adjust their fire due to the number of shell splashes engulfing the Russian battleship. As the Russian squadron was now disorganized, Tōgō's battleships were running low on ammunition and some ships' main guns were disabled, he turned the battle over to his cruisers and <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s. "Retzivan" had effectively ended the duel between the opposing fleets, and had saved "Tsesarevich" from destruction. During the battle, "Retvizan" received 18 hits from large-calibre shells, and suffered 6 sailors killed and another 42 men wounded, including Schensnovich.

She was subsequently <a href="Siege%20of%20Port%20Arthur">besieged in Port Arthur</a> and sunk in shallow water by thirteen <a href="howitzer">howitzer</a> shells on 6 December 1904 after the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a> gained control of the heights surrounding the harbour. Schensnovich was the senior surviving naval officer and signed the capitulation of Port Arthur for the Imperial Russian Navy on 2 January 1905.

"Retvizan" was raised by the Japanese on 22 September 1905 and renamed "Hizen", after <a href="Hizen%20Province">Hizen Province</a>, two days later. The ship departed Port Arthur on 19 November and arrived at <a href="Sasebo%20Naval%20Arsenal">Sasebo</a> on 27 November where her repairs lasted until November 1908. Her fighting tops were removed, her light weapons were replaced by Japanese ones, and her boilers were replaced by Miyabara boilers. The barrels and breeches of her main guns were replaced by Japanese-built examples and all four above-water torpedo tubes were removed. In Japanese service her crew numbered 796 officers and crewmen.

"Hizen" was assigned to the <a href="1st%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">1st Fleet</a> on 1 December 1909 and was refitted in 1913. She was dispatched to <a href="Esquimalt">Esquimalt</a>, British Columbia, in October 1914 to reinforce the weak British squadron there, then diverted to <a href="Honolulu">Honolulu</a>, Hawaii, before the end of the month to watch the <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">German gunboat</a> after that ship arrived on 15 October. "Hizen" watched the port in company with the <a href="armoured%20cruiser">armoured cruiser</a> until "Geier" was interned on 8 November by the Americans. Afterwards she and "Asama" headed south in search of the <a href="German%20East%20Asia%20Squadron">German East Asia Squadron</a>, but never located them; the ship was recalled home in February 1915. On 13 December 1915, "Hizen" was assigned to the 5th Division of the <a href="3rd%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">3rd Fleet</a> until relieved on 10 May 1917. The ship served in the Indian Ocean at some point during the war where she probably escorted troop convoys.

"Hizen" supported the Japanese <a href="Allied%20intervention%20in%20the%20Russian%20Civil%20War">intervention in the Russian Civil War</a> in 1918 and was often stationed in Vladivostok as a <a href="guardship">guardship</a>. On 1 September 1921 she was reclassified as a 1st class <a href="coast%20defence%20ship">coast defence ship</a> and disarmed at Sasebo in April 1922 in accordance with the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a>. She was stricken on 20 September 1923 and sunk as a <a href="target%20ship">target ship</a> in the <a href="Bungo%20Channel">Bungo Channel</a> on 25 July 1924.

Giant otter

The giant otter or giant river otter
("Pteronura brasiliensis") is a <a href="South%20America">South America</a>n <a href="carnivorous">carnivorous</a> mammal. It is the longest member of the <a href="Mustelidae">Mustelidae</a>, or <a href="weasel">weasel</a> family, a globally successful group of predators, reaching up to . Atypical of mustelids, the giant otter is a social species, with family groups typically supporting three to eight members. The groups are centered on a dominant breeding pair and are extremely cohesive and cooperative. Although generally peaceful, the species is territorial, and aggression has been observed between groups. The giant otter is <a href="Diurnality">diurnal</a>, being active exclusively during daylight hours. It is the noisiest <a href="otter">otter</a> species, and distinct vocalisations have been documented that indicate alarm, aggression and reassurance.

The giant otter ranges across north-central South America; it lives mostly in and along the <a href="Amazon%20River">Amazon River</a> and in the <a href="Pantanal">Pantanal</a>.

Its distribution has been greatly reduced and is now discontinuous. Decades of <a href="poaching">poaching</a> for its velvety pelt, peaking in the 1950s and 1960s, considerably diminished population numbers. The species was listed as <a href="endangered">endangered</a> in 1999 and wild population estimates are typically below 5,000. <a href="The%20Guianas">The Guianas</a> are one of the last real strongholds for the species, which also enjoys modest numbers — and significant protection — in the Peruvian Amazonian basin. It is one of the most endangered mammal species in the neotropics. Habitat degradation and loss is the greatest current threat. The giant otter is also rare in captivity; in 2003, only 60 animals were being held.

The giant otter shows a variety of adaptations suitable to an amphibious lifestyle, including exceptionally dense fur, a wing-like tail, and webbed feet. The species prefers freshwater rivers and streams, which are usually seasonally flooded, and may also take to freshwater lakes and springs. It constructs extensive campsites close to feeding areas, clearing large amounts of vegetation. The giant otter subsists almost exclusively on a <a href="piscivore">diet of fish</a>, particularly <a href="characin">characin</a>s and <a href="catfish">catfish</a>, but may also eat <a href="crab">crab</a>s, <a href="turtle">turtle</a>s, <a href="snake">snake</a>s and small <a href="caiman">caiman</a>. It has no serious natural predators other than <a href="humans">humans</a>, although it must compete with other species, including the <a href="neotropical%20otter">neotropical otter</a> and caiman species, for food resources.

The giant otter has a handful of other names. In Brazil it is known as "ariranha", from the <a href="Tup%C3%AD%20people">Tupí</a> word "ari'raña", meaning water jaguar (). In Spanish, river wolf () and water dog () are used occasionally (though the latter <a href="Water%20dog%20%28disambiguation%29">also refers to several different animals</a>) and may have been more common in the reports of explorers in the 19th and early 20th centuries. All three names are in use in South America, with a number of regional variations. "Giant otter" translates literally as "nutria gigante" and "lontra gigante" in Spanish and Portuguese, respectively. Among the <a href="Achuar%20people">Achuar</a> people, they are known as "wankanim", and among the <a href="Sanum%C3%A1">Sanumá</a> as "hadami". The genus name, "Pteronura", is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> words "pteron"/πτερον (feather or wing) and "ura"/ουρά (tail), a reference to its distinctive, wing-like tail.

The otters form the subfamily <a href="Lutrinae">Lutrinae</a> within the mustelids and the giant otter is the <a href="monotypic">only member</a> of the genus "Pteronura". Two subspecies are currently recognized by the canonical <a href="Mammal%20Species%20of%20the%20World">Mammal Species of the World</a>, "P. b. brasiliensis" and "P. b. paraguensis". Incorrect descriptions of the species have led to multiple synonyms (the latter subspecies is often "P. b. paranensis" in the literature). "P. b. brasiliensis" is distributed across the north of the giant otter range, including the <a href="Orinoco">Orinoco</a>, <a href="Amazon%20River">Amazon</a>, and Guianas river systems; to the south, "P. b. paraguensis" has been suggested in <a href="Paraguay">Paraguay</a>, <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>, southern <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, and northern <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, although it may be extinct in the last three of these four. The <a href="World%20Conservation%20Union">World Conservation Union</a> (IUCN) considers the species' presence in Argentina and Uruguay uncertain. In the former, investigation has shown thinly distributed population remnants. "P. b. paraguensis" is supposedly smaller and more gregarious, with different <a href="dentition">dentition</a> and skull <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a>. Carter and Rosas, however, rejected the subspecific division in 1997, noting the classification had only been validated once, in 1968, and the "P. b. paraguensis" type specimen was very similar to "P. b. brasiliensis". Biologist <a href="Nicole%20Duplaix">Nicole Duplaix</a> calls the division of "doubtful value".

An extinct genus, "Satherium", is believed to be ancestral to the present species, having migrated to the New World during the <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a> or early <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>. The giant otter shares the South American continent with three of the four members of the New World otter genus "<a href="Lontra">Lontra</a>": the <a href="neotropical%20river%20otter">neotropical river otter</a>, the <a href="southern%20river%20otter">southern river otter</a>, and the <a href="marine%20otter">marine otter</a>. (The <a href="North%20American%20river%20otter">North American river otter</a> ("Lontra canadensis") is the fourth "Lontra" member.) The giant otter seems to have evolved independently of "Lontra" in South America, despite the overlap. The <a href="smooth-coated%20otter">smooth-coated otter</a> ("Lutrogale perspicillata") of Asia may be its closest extant relative; similar behaviour, vocalizations, and skull morphology have been noted. Both species also show strong <a href="pair%20bonding">pair bonding</a> and paternal engagement in rearing cubs. Giant otter fossil remains have been recovered from a cave in the Brazilian <a href="Mato%20Grosso">Mato Grosso</a>.

<a href="Phylogenetic">Phylogenetic</a> analysis by Koepfli and Wayne in 1998 found the giant otter has the highest divergence sequences within the otter subfamily, forming a distinct <a href="clade">clade</a> that split away 10 to 14 million years ago. They noted that the species may be the <a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> divergence among the otters or fall outside of them altogether, having split even before other mustelids, such as the <a href="ermine">ermine</a>, <a href="Mustelinae">polecat</a>, and <a href="mink">mink</a>. Later <a href="DNA%20sequencing">gene sequencing</a> research on the mustelids, from 2005, places the divergence of the giant otter somewhat later, between five and 11 million years ago; the corresponding <a href="phylogenetic%20tree">phylogenetic tree</a> locates the "Lontra" divergence first among otter genera, and "Pteronura" second, although divergence ranges overlap.

The giant otter is large, gregarious, and <a href="diurnality">diurnal</a>. Early travellers' reports describe noisy groups surrounding explorers' boats, but little scientific information was available on the species until Duplaix's groundbreaking work in the late 1970s. Concern over this endangered species has since generated a body of research. 

The giant otter is clearly distinguished from other otters by morphological and behavioural characteristics. It has the greatest body length of any species in the mustelid family, although the <a href="sea%20otter">sea otter</a> may be heavier. Males are between in length from head to tail and females between . The animal's well-muscled tail can add a further to the total body length. Early reports of skins and living animals suggested exceptionally large males of up to ; intensive hunting likely reduced the occurrence of such massive specimens. Weights are between for males and for females.
The giant otter has the shortest fur of all otter species; it is typically chocolate brown, but may be reddish or <a href="fawn%20%28color%29">fawn</a>, and appears nearly black when wet. The fur is extremely dense, so much so that water cannot penetrate to the skin. <a href="Guard%20hair">Guard hair</a>s trap water and keep the inner fur dry; the guard hairs are approximately 8 millimetres (one-third of an inch) in length, about twice as long as the fur of the inner coat. Its velvety feel makes the animal highly sought after by fur traders and has contributed to its decline. Unique markings of white or cream fur color the throat and under the chin, allow individuals to be identified from birth. Giant otters use these marks to recognize one another, and upon meeting other otters, they engage in a behavior known as "periscoping", displaying their throats and upper chests to each other.

Giant otter muzzles are short and sloping and give the head a ball-shaped appearance. The ears are small and rounded. The nose (or <a href="rhinarium">rhinarium</a>) is completely covered in fur, with only the two slit-like nostrils visible. The giant otter's highly sensitive whiskers (<a href="vibrissae">vibrissae</a>) allow the animal to track changes in water pressure and currents, which aids in detecting prey. The legs are short and stubby and end in large webbed feet tipped with sharp claws. Well suited for an aquatic life, it can close its ears and nose while underwater.

At the time of Carter and Rosas' writing, vision had not been directly studied, but field observations show the animal primarily hunts by sight; above water, it is able to recognize observers at great distances. The fact that it is exclusively active during the day further suggests its eyesight should be strong, to aid in hunting and predator avoidance. In other otter species, vision is generally <a href="emmetropic">normal</a> or slightly <a href="myopic">myopic</a>, both on land and in water. The giant otter's hearing is acute and its sense of smell is excellent.

The species possesses 2n = 38 chromosomes.

The giant otter is an especially noisy animal, with a complex repertoire of <a href="Animal%20communication">vocalization</a>s. All otters produce vocalizations, but by frequency and volume, the giant otter may be the most vocal. Duplaix identified nine distinct sounds, with further subdivisions possible, depending on context. Quick "hah" barks or explosive snorts suggest immediate interest and possible danger. A wavering scream may be used in bluff charges against intruders, while a low growl is used for aggressive warning. Hums and coos are more reassuring within the group. Whistles may be used as advance warning of nonhostile intent between groups, although evidence is limited. Newborn pups squeak to elicit attention, while older young whine and wail when they begin to participate in group activities. An analysis published in 2014 cataloged 22 distinct types of vocalization in adults and 11 in neonates. Each family of otters was shown to have its own unique audio signature.

The giant otter is a highly social animal and lives in extended family groups. Group sizes are anywhere from two to 20 members, but likely average between three and eight. (Larger figures may reflect two or three family groups temporarily feeding together.) The groups are strongly cohesive: the otters sleep, play, travel, and feed together.
Group members share roles, structured around the dominant breeding pair. The species is territorial, with groups marking their ranges with <a href="latrine%20%28animal%29">latrine</a>s, gland secretions, and vocalizations. At least one case of a change in alpha relationship has been reported, with a new male taking over the role; the mechanics of the transition were not determined. Duplaix suggests a division between "residents", who are established within groups and territories, and nomadic and solitary "transients"; the categories do not seem rigid, and both may be a normal part of the giant otter life cycle. One tentative theory for the development of sociality in mustelids is that locally abundant, but unpredictably dispersed, prey causes groups to form.

Aggression within the species ("intraspecific" conflict) has been documented. Defence against intruding animals appears to be cooperative: while adult males typically lead in aggressive encounters, cases of alpha females guarding groups have been reported. One fight was directly observed in the Brazilian <a href="Pantanal">Pantanal</a> in which three animals violently engaged a single individual near a range boundary. In another instance in Brazil, a carcass was found with clear indications of violent assault by other otters, including bites to the snout and genitals, an attack pattern similar to that exhibited by captive animals. While not rare among large predators in general, intraspecific aggression is uncommon among otter species; Ribas and Mourão suggest a correlation to the animal's sociability, which is also rare among other otters.
A capacity for aggressive behavior should not be overstated with the giant otter. Researchers emphasize that even between groups, conflict avoidance is generally adopted. Within groups, the animals are extremely peaceful and cooperative. Group hierarchies are not rigid and the animals easily share roles.

Giant otters build dens, which are holes dug into riverbanks, usually with multiple entrances and multiple chambers inside. They give birth within these dens during the dry season. In Cantão State Park, otters dig their reproductive dens on the shores of <a href="oxbow%20lake">oxbow lake</a>s starting around July, when waters are already quite low. They give birth between August and September, and the young pups emerge for the first time in October and November, which are the months of lowest water and fish concentrations in the dwindling lakes and channels are at their peak. This makes it easier for the adults to catch enough fish for the growing young, and for the pups to learn how to catch fish. The entire group, including nonreproductive adults, which are usually older siblings to that year's pups, collaborates to catch enough fish for the young.

Details of giant otter reproduction and life cycle are scarce, and captive animals have provided much of the information. Females appear to give birth year round, although in the wild, births may peak during the dry season. The <a href="estrous">estrous</a> cycle is 21 days, with females receptive to sexual advances between three and 10 days. Study of captive specimens has found only males initiate copulation. At <a href="Tierpark%20Hagenbeck">Tierpark Hagenbeck</a> in Germany, long-term pair bonding and individualized mate selection were seen, with copulation most frequently taking place in water. Females have a gestation period of 65 to 70 days, giving birth to one to five pups, with an average of two. Research over five years on a breeding pair at the <a href="Cali%20Zoo">Cali Zoo</a> in Colombia found the average interval between litters was six to seven months, but as short as 77 days when the previous litter did not survive. Other sources have found greater intervals, with as long as 21 to 33 months suggested for otters in the wild.

Mothers give birth to furred and blind cubs in an underground den near the river shore and fishing sites. Males actively participate in rearing cubs and family cohesion is strong; older, juvenile siblings also participate in rearing, although in the weeks immediately after birth, they may temporarily leave the group. Pups open their eyes in their fourth week, begin walking in their fifth, and are able to swim confidently between 12 and 14 weeks old. They are weaned by nine months and begin hunting successfully soon after. The animal reaches sexual maturity at about two years of age and both male and female pups leave the group permanently after two to three years. They then search for new territory to begin a family of their own.

The giant otter is very sensitive to human activity when rearing its young. No institution, for example, has successfully raised giant otter cubs unless parents were provided sufficient privacy measures; the stress caused by human visual and acoustic interference can lead to neglect, abuse and <a href="Infanticide%20%28zoology%29">infanticide</a>, as well as decreased <a href="lactation">lactation</a>. In the wild, it has been suggested, although not systematically confirmed, that tourists cause similar stresses: disrupted lactation and denning, reduced hunting, and habitat abandonment are all risks. This sensitivity is matched by a strong protectiveness towards the young. All group members may aggressively charge intruders, including boats with humans in them.

The longest documented giant otter lifespan in the wild is eight years. In captivity, this may increase to 17, with an unconfirmed record of 19. The animal is susceptible to a variety of diseases, including <a href="canine%20parvovirus">canine parvovirus</a>. Parasites, such as the larvae of flies and a variety of intestinal worms, also afflict the giant otter. Other causes of death include accidents, <a href="gastroenteritis">gastroenteritis</a>, infanticide, and <a href="epileptic">epileptic</a> seizures.

The giant otter is an <a href="apex%20predator">apex predator</a>, and its population status reflects the overall health of riverine ecosystems. It feeds mainly on fish, including <a href="cichlids">cichlids</a>, <a href="characin">characin</a>s (such as <a href="piranha">piranha</a>), and <a href="catfish">catfish</a>. One full-year study of giant otter scats in Amazonian Brazil found fish present in all fecal samples. Fish from the <a href="order%20%28biology%29">order</a> <a href="Perciformes">Perciformes</a>, particularly cichlids, were seen in 97% of scats, and <a href="Characiformes">Characiformes</a>, such as characins, in 86%. Fish remains were of medium-sized species that seem to prefer relatively shallow water, to the advantage of the probably visually oriented giant otter. Prey species found were also sedentary, generally swimming only short distances, which may aid the giant otter in predation. Hunting in shallow water has also been found to be more rewarding, with water depth less than having the highest success rate. The giant otter seems to be <a href="opportunist%20predator">opportunistic</a>, taking whatever species are most locally abundant. If fish are unavailable, it will also take <a href="crab">crab</a>s, <a href="snake">snake</a>s, and even small <a href="caiman">caiman</a>s and <a href="anaconda">anaconda</a>s.

The species can hunt singly, in pairs, and in groups, relying on sharp eyesight to locate prey. In some cases, supposed cooperative hunting may be incidental, a result of group members fishing individually in close proximity; truly coordinated hunting may only occur where the prey cannot be taken by a single giant otter, such as with small anacondas and juvenile <a href="black%20caiman">black caiman</a>. The giant otter seems to prefer <a href="prey%20fish">prey fish</a> that are generally immobile on river bottoms in clear water. Prey chase is rapid and tumultuous, with lunges and twists through the shallows and few missed targets. The otter can attack from both above and below, swiveling at the last instant to clamp the prey in its jaws. Giant otters catch their own food and consume it immediately; they grasp the fish firmly between the forepaws and begin eating noisily at the head. Carter and Rosas have found captive adult animals consume around 10% of their body weight daily—about , in keeping with findings in the wild.

The species is amphibious, although primarily terrestrial. It occurs in freshwater rivers and streams, which generally flood seasonally. Other water habitats include freshwater springs and permanent freshwater lakes. Four specific vegetation types occur on one important creek in Suriname: riverbank high forest, floodable mixed marsh and high swamp forest, floodable low marsh forest, and grass islands and floating meadows within open areas of the creek itself. Duplaix identified two critical factors in habitat selection: food abundance, which appears to positively correlate to shallow water, and low sloping banks with good cover and easy access to preferred water types. The giant otter seems to choose clear, black waters with rocky or sandy bottoms over silty, saline, and white waters. 

Giant otters use areas beside rivers for building dens, campsites, and latrines. They clear significant amounts of vegetation while building their campsites. One report suggests maximum areas long and wide, well-marked by scent glands, urine, and feces to signal territory. Carter and Rosas found average areas a third this size. Giant otters adopt communal latrines beside campsites, and dig dens with a handful of entrances, typically under root systems or fallen trees. One report found between three and eight campsites, clustered around feeding areas. In seasonally flooded areas, the giant otter may abandon campsites during the wet season, dispersing to flooded forests in search of prey. Giant otters may adopt preferred locations perennially, often on high ground. These can become quite extensive, including "backdoor" exits into forests and swamps, away from the water. Otters do not visit or mark every site daily, but usually patrol all of them, often by a pair of otters in the morning.

Research generally takes place in the dry season and an understanding of the species' overall habitat use remains partial. An analysis of dry season range size for three otter groups in Ecuador found areas between . Utreras presumed habitat requirements and availability would differ dramatically in the rainy season: estimating range sizes of 1.98 to as much as 19.55 square kilometres (0.76 to 7.55 sq miles) for the groups. Other researchers suggest approximately and note a strong inverse correlation between <a href="social%20behaviour">sociality</a> and home range size; the highly social giant otter has smaller home range sizes than would be expected for a species of its mass. Population densities varied with a high of reported in Suriname and with a low of found in Guyana.

Adult giant otters living in family groups have no known serious natural <a href="predator">predator</a>s, however there are some accounts of <a href="black%20caiman">black caiman</a>s in <a href="Peru">Peru</a> and <a href="yacare%20caiman">yacare caiman</a>s in the <a href="Pantanal">Pantanal</a> preying on giant otters. In addition, solitary animals and young may be vulnerable to attacks by the <a href="jaguar">jaguar</a>, <a href="cougar">cougar</a>, and <a href="anaconda">anaconda</a>, but this is based on historical reports, not direct observation. Pups are more vulnerable, and may be taken by caiman and other large predators, although adults are constantly mindful of stray young, and will harass and fight off possible predators. When in the water, the giant otter faces danger from animals not strictly preying upon it: the <a href="electric%20eel">electric eel</a> and <a href="stingray">stingray</a> are potentially deadly if stumbled upon, and piranha may be capable of at least taking bites out of a giant otter, as evidenced by scarring on individuals.

Even if without direct predation, the giant otter must still compete with other predators for food resources. Duplaix documented interaction with the <a href="neotropical%20otter">neotropical otter</a>. While the two species are <a href="sympatric">sympatric</a> (with overlapping ranges) during certain seasons, there appeared to be no serious conflict. The smaller neotropical otter is far more shy, less noisy, and less social; at about a third the weight of the giant otter, it is more vulnerable to predation, hence, a lack of conspicuousness is to its advantage. The neotropical otter is active during twilight and darkness, reducing the likelihood of conflict with the diurnal giant otter. Its smaller prey, different denning habits, and different preferred water types also reduce interaction.

Other species that prey upon similar food resources include the caimans and large fish that are themselves <a href="piscivore">piscivore</a>s. <a href="Gymnotid">Gymnotid</a>s, such as the electric eel, and the large <a href="silurid">silurid</a> catfish are among aquatic competitors. Two river dolphins, the <a href="tucuxi">tucuxi</a> and <a href="boto">boto</a>, might potentially compete with the giant otter, but different spatial use and dietary preferences suggest minimal overlap. Furthermore, Defler observed associations between giant otters and the <a href="Amazon%20river%20dolphin">Amazon river dolphin</a>s, and suggested that dolphins may benefit by fish fleeing from the otters. The <a href="spectacled%20caiman">spectacled caiman</a> is another potential competitor, but Duplaix found no conflict with the species in <a href="Suriname">Suriname</a>.

The IUCN listed the giant otter as "endangered" in 1999; it had been considered "<a href="Vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a>" under all previous listings from 1982 when sufficient data had first become available. It is regulated internationally under Appendix I of the <a href="Convention%20on%20International%20Trade%20in%20Endangered%20Species%20of%20Wild%20Fauna%20and%20Flora">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora</a> (CITES): all trade in specimens and parts is illegal.

The animal faces a variety of critical threats. <a href="Poaching">Poaching</a> has long been a problem. Statistics show between 1959 and 1969 Amazonian Brazil alone accounted for 1,000 to 3,000 pelts annually. The species was so thoroughly decimated, the number dropped to just 12 in 1971. The implementation of CITES in 1973 finally brought about significant hunting reductions, although demand did not disappear entirely: in the 1980s, pelt prices were as high as US$250 on the European market. The threat has been exacerbated by the otters' relative fearlessness and tendency to approach human beings. They are extremely easy to hunt, being active through the day and highly inquisitive. The animal's relatively late sexual maturity and complex social life makes hunting especially disastrous.

More recently, habitat destruction and degradation have become the principal dangers, and a further reduction of 50% is expected in giant otter numbers within the 20 years after 2004 (about the span of three generations of giant otters). Typically, loggers first move into rainforest, clearing the vegetation along riverbanks. Farmers follow, creating depleted soil and disrupted habitats. As human activity expands, giant otter home ranges become increasingly isolated. Subadults leaving in search of new territory find it impossible to set up family groups. Specific threats from human industry include unsustainable <a href="mahogany">mahogany</a> logging in parts of the giant otter range, and concentrations of <a href="mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a> in its diet of fish, a byproduct of gold mining. Water pollution from mining, fossil fuel extraction, and agriculture is a serious danger; concentrations of <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s and other chemicals are magnified at each step in the food chain, and can poison top predators such as the giant otter.

Other threats to the giant otter include conflict with fishermen, who often view the species as a nuisance (<a href="%23Interactions%20with%20indigenous%20peoples">see below</a>). <a href="Ecotourism">Ecotourism</a> also presents challenges: while it raises money and awareness for the animals, by its nature it also increases human effect on the species, both through associated development and direct disturbances in the field. A number of restrictions on land use and human intrusion are required to properly maintain wild populations. Schenck "et al.", who undertook extensive fieldwork in Peru in the 1990s, suggest specific "no-go" zones where the species is most frequently observed, offset by observation towers and platforms to allow viewing. Limits on the number of tourists at any one time, fishing prohibitions, and a minimum safe distance of are proposed to offer further protection.

The giant otter has lost as much as 80% of its South American range. While still present in a number of north-central countries, giant otter populations are under considerable stress. The IUCN lists <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>, Brazil, <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a>, <a href="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>, <a href="French%20Guiana">French Guiana</a>, <a href="Guyana">Guyana</a>, <a href="Paraguay">Paraguay</a>, <a href="Peru">Peru</a>, Suriname, and <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> as current range countries. Given local extinctions, the species' range has become discontinuous. Total population numbers are difficult to estimate. An IUCN study in 2006 suggested 1,000 to 5,000 otters remain. Populations in Bolivia were once widespread but the country became a "black spot" on distribution maps after poaching between the 1940s and 1970s; a relatively healthy, but still small, population of 350 was estimated in the country in 2002. The species has likely been extirpated from southern Brazil, but in the west of the country, decreased hunting pressure in the critical <a href="Pantanal">Pantanal</a> has led to very successful recolonization; an estimate suggests 1,000 or more animals in the region. 

In 2006, most of this species lived in the Brazilian Amazon and its bordering areas. A significant population lives in the wetlands of the central <a href="Araguaia%20River">Araguaia River</a>, and in particular within Cantão State Park, which, with its 843 <a href="oxbow%20lake">oxbow lake</a>s and extensive flooded forests and marshlands, is one of the best habitat patches for this species in Brazil.

Suriname still has significant forest cover and an extensive system of protected areas, much of which protects the giant otter. Duplaix returned to the country in 2000 and found the giant otter still present on the <a href="Kaburi%20Creek">Kaburi Creek</a>, a "jewel" of <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a>, although increased human presence and land use suggests, sooner or later, the species may not be able to find suitable habitat for campsites. In a report for <a href="World%20Wildlife%20Fund">World Wildlife Fund</a> in 2002, Duplaix was emphatic about the importance of Suriname and the other Guianas: 

Other countries have taken a lead in designating protected areas in South America. In 2004, Peru created one of the largest conservation areas in the world, <a href="Alto%20Pur%C3%BAs%20National%20Park">Alto Purús National Park</a>, with an area similar in size to Belgium. The park harbors many endangered plants and animals, including the giant otter, and holds the world record for mammal diversity. Bolivia designated wetlands larger than the size of Switzerland as a freshwater protected area in 2001; these are also home to the giant otter.

Throughout its range, the giant otter interacts with <a href="indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">indigenous groups</a>, who often practice traditional hunting and fishing. A study of five indigenous communities in Colombia suggests native attitudes toward the animal are a threat: the otters are often viewed as a nuisance that interferes with fishing, and are sometimes killed. Even when told of the importance of the species to ecosystems and the danger of extinction, interviewees showed little interest in continuing to coexist with the species. Schoolchildren, however, had a more positive impression of the animal.

In Suriname, the giant otter is not a traditional prey species for human hunters, which affords some protection. (One researcher has suggested the giant otter is hunted only in desperation due to its horrible taste.) The animal sometimes drowns in nets set across rivers and machete attacks by fishermen have been noted, according to Duplaix, but "tolerance is the rule" in Suriname. One difference in behavior was seen in the country in 2002: the normally inquisitive giant otters showed "active avoidance behavior with visible panic" when boats appeared. Logging, hunting, and pup seizure may have led groups to be far more wary of human activity.

Local people sometimes take pups for the <a href="exotic%20pet">exotic pet trade</a> or as pets for themselves, but the animal rapidly grows to become unmanageable. Duplaix relates the story of an <a href="Arawak%20peoples">Arawak</a> Indian who took two pups from their parents. While revealing of the affection held for the animals, the seizure was a profound blow to the breeding pair, which went on to lose their territory to competitors.

The species has also appeared in the folklore of the region. It plays an important role in the mythology of the <a href="Achuar%20people">Achuar people</a>, where giant otters are seen as a form of the "tsunki", or water spirits: they are a sort of "water people" who feed on fish. They appear in a <a href="Fish%20toxins">fish poisoning</a> legend where they assist a man who has wasted his sexual energy, creating the <a href="anaconda">anaconda</a>s of the world from his distressed and extended genitals. The <a href="Boror%C3%B3%20people">Bororó people</a> have a legend on the origin of <a href="tobacco%20smoking">tobacco smoking</a>: those who used the leaf improperly by swallowing it were punished by being transformed into giant otters; the Bororo also associate the giant otter with fish and with fire. A <a href="Ticuna%20language">Ticuna</a> legend has it that the giant otter exchanged places with the jaguar: the story says jaguar formerly lived in the water and the giant otter came to the land only to eat. The indigenous <a href="Kichwa">Kichwa</a> peoples from Amazonian Peru believed in a world of water where <a href="Yaku%20runa">Yaku runa</a> reigned as mother of the water and was charged with caring for fish and animals. Giant otters served as Yaku runa's canoes. A <a href="Maxakali%20%28people%29">Maxacali</a> creation story suggests that the practice of <a href="otter%20fishing">otter fishing</a> may have been prevalent in the past.

Pied butcherbird

The pied butcherbird ("Cracticus nigrogularis") is a songbird native to <a href="Australia">Australia</a>. Described by <a href="John%20Gould">John Gould</a> in 1837, it is a black and white bird long with a long hooked bill. The head and throat are black, making a distinctive hood, as well as the <a href="Bird%23Anatomy%20and%20physiology">mantle</a>, and much of the tail and wings. The neck, underparts and outer wing feathers are white. The juvenile and immature birds are predominantly brown and white. As they mature their brown feathers are replaced by black feathers. Two subspecies are recognized.

Within its range, the pied butcherbird is generally sedentary. Common in woodlands and in urban environments, it is carnivorous, eating small vertebrates and insects. A tame and inquisitive bird, the pied butcherbird has been known to accept food from humans. It nests in trees, constructing a cup-shaped structure out of sticks and laying two to five eggs. The pied butcherbird engages in <a href="cooperative%20breeding">cooperative breeding</a>, with a mated pair sometimes assisted by several helper birds. The troop is territorial, defending the nesting site from intruders. The <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) has assessed the pied butcherbird as being of <a href="Least-concern%20species">least concern</a> on account of its large range and apparently stable population.

The pied butcherbird was first described by the ornithologist <a href="John%20Gould">John Gould</a> in 1837 as "Vanga nigrogularis". The <a href="Type%20%28biology%29%23In%20zoology">type specimen</a> was collected near Sydney. The species name is from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> words "niger" (black), and "gula" (throat). Gould described "Cracticus picatus" in 1848 from northern Australia, calling it "A miniature representative of, and nearly allied to, but distinct from, "Cracticus nigrogularis"." The word "picatus" is <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "daubed with pitch", hence "black patches. This was reclassified as a <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of "C. nigrogularis". <a href="Gregory%20Mathews">Gregory Mathews</a> described subspecies "inkermani" from Queensland and subspecies "mellori" from Victoria and South Australia in 1912, on the basis of smaller and larger size than the <a href="Subspecies%23Nominotypical%20subspecies%20and%20subspecies%20autonyms">nominate</a> subspecies respectively. Both are now regarded as inseparable from the nominate subspecies. Mathews described subspecies "kalgoorli" from Kalgoorlie in 1912 on the basis of its longer bill than the nominate subspecies, but is regarded today as part of subspecies "picatus".

Two subspecies are recognised today. The nominate subspecies "nigrogularis" is found across eastern Australia, and subspecies "picatus" is found in the Northern Territory, Western Australia and northern South Australia. The latter subspecies has a broader ( wide) white collar and a more whitish rump, with specimens becoming smaller in the more northern parts of the range. The border between the two subspecies lies in the <a href="Gulf%20Country">Gulf Country</a> and is known as the Carpentarian Barrier. Although there is a demarcation in physical characters, this is not borne out genetically, and birds from northwestern Australia have affinities with the eastern subspecies. Analysis of <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> sequences indicates the pied butcherbird has expanded rapidly from many <a href="Refugium%20%28population%20biology%29">refugia</a> during the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>.

The pied butcherbird is one of six (or seven) members of the genus "<a href="Cracticus">Cracticus</a>" known as butcherbirds. Within the genus, it is most closely related to the <a href="Tagula%20butcherbird">Tagula butcherbird</a> ("C. louisiadensis") and <a href="hooded%20butcherbird">hooded butcherbird</a> ("C. cassicus"). The three form a monophyletic group within the genus, having diverged from ancestors of the <a href="grey%20butcherbird">grey butcherbird</a> around five million years ago. The <a href="butcherbird">butcherbird</a>s, <a href="Australian%20magpie">Australian magpie</a> ("Gymnorhina tibicen") and <a href="currawong">currawong</a>s ("Strepera" spp.) were placed in the family Cracticidae in 1914 by <a href="John%20Albert%20Leach">John Albert Leach</a> after he had studied their musculature. American ornithologists <a href="Charles%20Sibley">Charles Sibley</a> and <a href="Jon%20Edward%20Ahlquist">Jon Ahlquist</a> recognised the close relationship between <a href="woodswallow">woodswallow</a>s and the butcherbirds in 1985, and combined them into a Cracticini <a href="clade">clade</a>, which became the family Artamidae in 1994.

"Pied butcherbird" has been designated the official name by the <a href="International%20Ornithological%20Committee">International Ornithological Committee</a> (IOC). Black-throated butcherbird is an alternative common name, as are Break o'day boy and organbird. Leach also called it the black-throated crow shrike, a name used by Gould for subspecies "nigrogularis" while calling subspecies "picatus" the pied crow-shrike. ‘Jackeroo’ is a colloquial name from the <a href="Musgrave%20Ranges">Musgrave Ranges</a> in <a href="Central%20Australia">Central Australia</a>. Gould recorded "Ka-ra-a-ra" as a name used by indigenous people of <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>. The <a href="Ngarluma">Ngarluma</a> people of the western Pilbara knew it as "gurrbaru". In the Yuwaaliyaay dialect of the <a href="Gamilaraay%20language">Gamilaraay language</a> of southeastern Australia, it is "buubuurrbu". Names recorded from central Australia include "alpirtaka" and "urbura" in the <a href="Upper%20Arrernte%20language">Upper Arrernte language</a>.

Like other butcherbirds, the pied butcherbird is stockily built with short legs and a relatively large head. It ranges from long, averaging around , with a wingspan and weight of around . The wings are fairly long, extending to half-way along the tail when folded. Its plumage is almost wholly black and white, with very little difference between the sexes. It has a black head, nape and throat, giving it the appearance of a black hood, which is bounded by a white neck collar, which is around wide. The black hood is slightly glossy in bright light, can fade a little with age, and is slightly duller and more brownish in the adult female. The neck collar in the female is slightly narrower at around and is a grey-white rather than white. Several stiff black bristles up to long arise from the lower <a href="Lore%20%28anatomy%29">lores</a>. The upper <a href="Bird%23Anatomy%20and%20physiology">mantle</a> and a few of the front <a href="List%20of%20terms%20used%20in%20bird%20topography%23Plumage%20features">scapulars</a> are white, contrasting sharply with the black lower mantle and the rest of the scapulars. The rump is pale grey, and the upper tail <a href="covert%20feather">coverts</a> are white. The tail is rather long, with a rounded or wedge-shaped tip. It has twelve <a href="Flight%20feather%23Rectrices">retrices</a>, which are black in colour. The tail tip and outer wing feathers are white. The underparts are white. The eyes are a dark brown, the legs grey and the bill a pale bluish grey tipped with black, with a prominent hook at the end.

The juvenile pied butcherbird has dark brown instead of black plumage, lacks the pale collar and has a cream to buff lores, chin, and upper throat, becoming more brown on the lower throat and breast. Its underparts are off-white to cream. The bill is dark brown. In its first year, it moults into its first immature plumage, which resembles that of the juvenile, but has a more extensive dark brown throat. Its bill is blue-grey with a dark brown or blackish tip.

The pied butcherbird has been considered the most accomplished songbird in Australia, its song described as a "magic flute" by one writer, richer and clearer than the Australian magpie. Song melodies vary across the continent and no single song is sung by the whole population. There is no clear demarcation between simple calls and elaborate songs: duets, and even larger choirs, are common. The species improvises extensively in creating new and complex melodies. One of its calls has been likened to the opening bars of <a href="Symphony%20No.%205%20%28Beethoven%29">Beethoven's Fifth Symphony</a>. Singing often takes place at dawn, and rarely late in the day. Pied butcherbirds sometimes sing on moonlit nights.

Three types of song have been described: the "day song" is the most common, sung by birds alone or in pairs as a chorus or an <a href="antiphon">antiphon</a>al duet, generally over the course of the day and while the birds are in flight. It appears to promote bonding and act as communication. The "whisper song" is sung more commonly in wet or windy weather, the singer sitting in a tree warbling soft and complex harmonies for up to 45 minutes, often mimicking many other bird species as well as dogs barking, lambs bleating or even people whistling. In the breeding season, pied butcherbirds sing the "breeding song" at night until dawn, when they switch to the day song. This song is longer and more complex than the day song. In response to threats, pied butcherbirds may chatter or make a harmonic alarm call composed of short, loud descending notes.

The black hood helps distinguish the pied butcherbird from other butcherbirds, the Australian magpie and much smaller magpie-lark, the latter of which also has a much smaller beak. It has a higher-pitched call than the <a href="grey%20butcherbird">grey butcherbird</a> and inhabits more open habitat. The juvenile pied butcherbird resembles the grey butcherbird: it has a buff upper throat and dark brown instead of black plumage.

The pied butcherbird is found across much of Australia, except the far south and Tasmania. It is only rarely recorded in the <a href="Sydney%20Basin">Sydney Basin</a> and absent from the <a href="Illawarra">Illawarra</a>, <a href="Southern%20Tablelands">Southern Tablelands</a> and south coast of New South Wales. In Victoria it is found along the <a href="Murray%20River">Murray Valley</a> and west of <a href="Chiltern%2C%20Victoria">Chiltern</a>. In South Australia it is not found in the northeast of the state nor on the Adelaide plain. It is found across Western Australia, though is absent from the <a href="Great%20Sandy%20Desert">Great Sandy Desert</a>. It is generally sedentary across most of its range, with minimal seasonal movements.

It is a bird of open <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forests, eucalypt and acacia woodlands and scrublands, with sparse or no <a href="understory">understory</a>, or low cover with shrubs such as "<a href="Triodia%20%28grass%29">Triodia</a>", "<a href="Lomandra">Lomandra</a>" or "<a href="Hibbertia">Hibbertia</a>". It is less common in <a href="Mallee%20Woodlands%20and%20Shrublands">mallee scrub</a>. In arid areas and northern Australia, it is more restricted to woodland alongside rivers and <a href="billabong">billabong</a>s. It has become more common in southwest Western Australia with land clearing, though has become rare around Darwin on account of urban development.

The pied butcherbird is listed as being a <a href="least%20concern">species of least concern</a> by the <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a>, on account of its large range and stable population, with no evidence of any significant decline.

The pied butcherbird is thought to be monogamous, though its breeding habits have not been much studied. There is evidence of <a href="cooperative%20breeding">cooperative breeding</a>, with some mated pairs being assisted by up to several other helper birds. These individuals help feed young and defend the nest. These pairs or small groups defend their territory from intruders, mobbing and chasing raptors and other birds, and occasionally dogs or people. They may attack animals (and people) that venture too close to the nest, with one bird coming front-on while the other may approach from behind.

The maximum age recorded from banding has been 22 years 1.7 months, for an individual banded in <a href="Rockhampton">Rockhampton</a> in June 1988 and recovered in August 2010–7 km away. The bird was injured and had to be euthanased.

Across most of its range, the pied butcherbird can generally be found breeding from winter to summer; eggs are laid anywhere from July to December, but mostly from September to November, and young can be present in the nest from August till February. There are reports of breeding outside these months, however. The nest is constructed of dry sticks with a finer material such as dried grass, black roly poly ("<a href="Sclerolaena%20muricata">Sclerolaena muricata</a>"), bark and leaves forming a cup-shaped interior. It is located in the fork of a tree, often among foliage and inconspicuous. The <a href="Clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> consists of two to five (most commonly three or four) oval eggs blotched with brown over a base colour of various shades of pale greyish- or brownish-green. Larger clutches have been recorded, such as at <a href="Jandowae">Jandowae</a> in Queensland, where two pairs laid eggs and were sharing incubation duties. Eggs of subspecies "nigrogularis" are larger, at around 33 mm long by 24 mm (1.3 by 0.95 in) wide, while those of subspecies "picatus" are around 31 mm long by 22 mm (1.2 by 0.85 in) wide. Incubation takes 19 to 21 days, with the eggs laid up to 48 hours apart and hatching at a similar interval. Like all <a href="passerine">passerine</a>s, the chicks are <a href="altricial">altricial</a>—they are born naked or sparsely covered in down and blind. They spend anywhere from 25 to 33 days in the nest before fledging, though may leave the nest early if disturbed. They are fed by parents and helper birds. Brood parasites recorded include the <a href="pallid%20cuckoo">pallid cuckoo</a> ("Cacomantis pallidus") and <a href="channel-billed%20cuckoo">channel-billed cuckoo</a> ("Scythrops novaehollandiae").

The pied butcherbird is carnivorous, and eats insects such as beetles, bugs, ants, caterpillars, and cockroaches, as well as spiders and worms. It preys on vertebrates up to the size of such animals as frogs, skinks, mice, and small birds such as the <a href="silvereye">silvereye</a> ("Zosterops lateralis"), <a href="house%20sparrow">house sparrow</a> ("Passer domesticus"), <a href="double-barred%20finch">double-barred finch</a> ("Taeniopygia bichenovii"), <a href="willie%20wagtail">willie wagtail</a> ("Rhipidura leucophrys"), and <a href="grey%20teal">grey teal</a> ("Anas gracilis") duckling. It has been looked upon favourably by farmers as it hunts such pests as grasshoppers and rodents. Some individuals look for scraps around houses and picnic sites, and can become tame enough to be fed by people, either by hand or by tossing food in the air. The pied butcherbird also eats fruit, such as those of sandpaper figs ("<a href="Ficus%20coronata">Ficus coronata</a>"), native cherry ("<a href="Exocarpos%20cupressiformis">Exocarpos cupressiformis</a>"), African boxthorn ("<a href="Lycium%20ferocissimum">Lycium ferocissimum</a>") and grapes ("<a href="Vitis%20vinifera">Vitis vinifera</a>"), and nectar of the Darwin woollybutt ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20miniata">Eucalyptus miniata</a>").

The pied butcherbird often perches on a fencepost, stump or branch while foraging for prey. It generally pounces on victims on the ground and eats them there. At times, it may hop or run along hunting ground-based food, and occasionally seize flying insects. It generally forages alone, or occasionally in pairs. The pied butcherbird has been observed hunting collaboratively with the <a href="Australian%20hobby">Australian hobby</a>, either picking off <a href="common%20starling">common starling</a>s or <a href="rufous-throated%20honeyeater">rufous-throated honeyeater</a>s disturbed by the larger hobby, or flushing out small birds from bushes, which the larger bird then hunts. The pied butcherbird sometimes stores food items by impaling them on a stick or on barbed wire, or shoving them in a nook or crevice.

Several Australian and international composers have been inspired by and written music incorporating the songs of the pied butcherbird, including <a href="Henry%20Tate%20%28poet%29">Henry Tate</a>, <a href="David%20Lumsdaine">David Lumsdaine</a> (who described it as "a virtuoso of composition and improvisation"), <a href="Don%20Harper">Don Harper</a>, <a href="Olivier%20Messiaen">Olivier Messiaen</a>, <a href="Elaine%20Barkin">Elaine Barkin</a>, <a href="John%20Rodgers%20%28musician%29">John Rodgers</a>, <a href="Ron%20Nagorcka">Ron Nagorcka</a>, and <a href="John%20Williamson%20%28singer%29">John Williamson</a>. In the dance 'Bird Song' by <a href="Siobhan%20Davies">Siobhan Davies</a>, the main central solo was accompanied by the call of a pied butcherbird and this same sound provided inspiration to much of the dance, including the improvisational aspects. Composer and researcher Hollis Taylor has studied pied butcherbird song for 12 years, and has released a double CD "Absolute Bird" based on fifty-plus pied butcherbird nocturnal solo songs. Taylor's 'Is Birdsong Music? Outback Encounters with an Australian Songbird' offers portraits of the remote locations where the species is found.

In the now extinct Warray language spoken on the Adelaide River in Arnhem Land, "Cracticus Nigrogularis" was known as lopolopo.

Title TK

Title TK is the third studio album by American <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> band <a href="the%20Breeders">the Breeders</a>, released on May 20 and 21, 2002 by <a href="4AD">4AD</a> in the United Kingdom and <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra Records</a> in the United States, and on May 10 by <a href="P-Vine%20Records">P-Vine Records</a> in Japan. The album—whose name means "<a href="To%20come%20%28publishing%29">title to come</a>" in journalistic shorthand—generated three singles: "<a href="Off%20You">Off You</a>", "Huffer", and "<a href="Son%20of%20Three">Son of Three</a>". "Title TK" reached the top 100 in France, Germany, the UK, and Australia, and number 130 in the US.

Following multiple changes in personnel after the release of "<a href="Last%20Splash">Last Splash</a>" (1993), singer and songwriter <a href="Kim%20Deal">Kim Deal</a> was the only remaining constant member of the Breeders by 1996. The next year, she returned to the studio in an attempt to record a follow-up album, but her behavior—including drug use and demanding expectations—alienated many of the musicians and <a href="recording%20engineer">engineers</a> with whom she worked.

In 1999, joined by her sister <a href="Kelley%20Deal">Kelley</a>, Deal began recording sessions with engineer <a href="Steve%20Albini">Steve Albini</a> in Chicago. <a href="Fear%20%28band%29">Fear</a> members Mando Lopez and Richard Presley, and musician <a href="Jose%20Medeles">Jose Medeles</a>, joined the line-up. The group continued recording with Albini in 2001. "Title TK" was compiled from the output of these sessions and supplemented with two tracks recorded in Los Angeles with engineers Andrew Alekel and Mark Arnold. Of the twelve songs on the album, ten are credited solely to Kim Deal; the other two were written by all five band members.

Commentary on the album has included discussion of its minimal instrumentation and the interjection of unexpected sounds. Reviewers have described the lyrics on the songs as unconventional and dark, and noted the prominence of vocal harmonies between the Deal sisters. The reception of "Title TK" has been generally positive; appraisal has included commendation for Albini's contributions to the sound of the album, and for how the recordings isolate individual instruments.

From the formation of <a href="the%20Breeders">the Breeders</a> in 1989 until the mid-1990s, the line-up changed several times. Vocalist and songwriter <a href="Kim%20Deal">Kim Deal</a> was the band's sole consistent member. The line-up that recorded the group's debut "<a href="Pod%20%28The%20Breeders%20album%29">Pod</a>" (released in 1990) included guitarist <a href="Tanya%20Donelly">Tanya Donelly</a> and drummer <a href="Britt%20Walford">Britt Walford</a>; they were replaced by Deal's sister <a href="Kelley%20Deal">Kelley</a> and Jim Macpherson by the time the band's 1993 album "<a href="Last%20Splash">Last Splash</a>" was recorded. Kelley Deal and original bassist <a href="Josephine%20Wiggs">Josephine Wiggs</a> left in 1995. Kim Deal formed <a href="the%20Amps">the Amps</a> that year, but reformed the Breeders in 1996—initially using the Amps' line-up: Deal (vocals), Macpherson (drums), Luis Lerma (bass), and Nate Farley (guitar).

Throughout 1997, Deal attempted to record tracks for a forthcoming album. Engineers and musicians on the project found that Deal's behavior and demanding musical standards created a difficult working environment. Deal's actions and the unenjoyable atmosphere of the recording sessions at the time caused Macpherson and Farley to leave the group. Several other musicians recruited throughout the year left for similar reasons. The 1997 sessions cost hundreds of thousands of dollars through the use of four New York studios, the expense of moving equipment between them, and hotel costs.

Three recording engineers parted ways with Deal in 1997. The first engineer she hired—Mark Freegard, who had co-produced "Last Splash"—has remarked that Deal was "totally lost" and that after seven weeks in the studio, there were no usable recordings. Two subsequent engineers, <a href="John%20Agnello">John Agnello</a> and <a href="Bryce%20Goggin">Bryce Goggin</a>, had each worked with Deal in 1995 on parts of the Amps' album "<a href="Pacer%20%28album%29">Pacer</a>". Agnello became increasingly frustrated with Deal's drug use and the difficulty of retaining musicians. When Deal disappeared for several days without notice, Agnello left the recording sessions. Goggin later said it would have been impossible to find anyone able to play at the standards Deal required. She was unsatisfied with a drumming performance (by the percussionist of <a href="the%20Flaming%20Lips">the Flaming Lips</a>) that Goggin thought was outstanding, so he "told her to go home and practice playing drums." Deal followed his advice, and returned to her home in Ohio to practice the instrument.

Deal began recording again in 1999, first in Austin, Texas, and then at <a href="Electrical%20Audio">Electrical Audio</a> studio in Chicago with <a href="Steve%20Albini">Steve Albini</a>, with whom she had previously worked on "Pod", "Pacer", and <a href="Pixies">the Pixies</a>' album "<a href="Surfer%20Rosa">Surfer Rosa</a>". Although Deal performed most of the instruments herself at the 1999 sessions, her sister had some involvement. They recorded "The She", "Forced to Drive", and "Too Alive" in Chicago, with Deal's drum performance on the third track taken from the Texas session.

Deal was satisfied with the material recorded up to this point, but realized she would not be able to tour without a band. She returned to New York to look for a backing group in March 2000. After a chance meeting with members of <a href="Fear%20%28band%29">Fear</a>, she invited drummer Andrew Jaimez, bassist Mando Lopez, and guitarist Richard Presley to <a href="jam%20session">jam</a> with her at the studio she was renting. Deal wanted to continue playing with these musicians, and so within three months she moved to Fear's hometown Los Angeles. Jaimez, Lopez, and Presley joined the Breeders, and Kelley Deal rejoined the group soon after. About a month after Kim Deal's arrival, <a href="Jose%20Medeles">Jose Medeles</a> replaced Jaimez, who decided he did not have enough time for the Breeders because of his involvement in other musical projects. The new line-up spent the rest of the year writing and rehearsing.

The Breeders returned to Chicago in mid-2001 to continue recording with Albini. "Little Fury", "London Song", "Off You", "Put on a Side", "Full on Idle", "T and T", and "Huffer" were recorded in 2001. At some point from 2000 to 2002, the group spent time at the Grandmaster Recording Ltd. studio in Los Angeles. The session at Grandmaster Recording, engineered by Mark Arnold and Andrew Alekel, resulted in "Son of Three" and "Sinister Foxx". "Fire the Maid", a song from these sessions written and sung by Kelley Deal, was performed in concert in 2000 and 2001 but was not included on the album.

Kelley Deal has stated that "Little Fury" and "Sinister Foxx" started as "just ideas" by the sisters that turned into full collaborations by the group—all five musicians received songwriting credits on these tracks. Kim Deal is credited as sole songwriter on the remaining ten tracks, although other band members contributed musical ideas as well.

During the "Title TK" sessions, Kim Deal adopted a philosophy she calls "All Wave". This approach stipulates that only analog recording may be used, without computer editing. Deal has said that she likes "interesting mistakes" in song production, and that her beliefs about recording are "a reaction ... to everything sounding so straight and clean in most records today". The album's <a href="audio%20mastering">mastering</a> was also done using analog processes, by Albini and Steve Rook, at <a href="Abbey%20Road%20Studios">Abbey Road Studios</a> in London.

A sparse, minimal style of instrumentation is used on "Title TK". Throughout the album, the band makes use of unexpected or jarring musical ideas. One reviewer described the way "keyboards buzz from out of nowhere, guitars hit bum notes intentionally, basslines amble up and down the scale, sometimes two at a time." Another commentator described the progression of "Put on a Side" as follows: "At 1.28 there is a distorted chug. At 2.29 a drum-roll. Neither of these introduces anything, continues or reappears. They just pop up and then evaporate like accidental fireworks." "Title TK" has been noted on one hand for big contrasts in speed and levity from song to song, and on the other, for the unified feel of the entire album.

The unconventional character of "Title TK"s lyrics has been emphasized in reviews. Opinion has been divided on the intelligibility of the lyrics. Lines from "Son of Three" and "Little Fury" have been highlighted for their poetic qualities. Others have taken the album's words to be opaque with confusing imagery. Critics have noted both the dark tendencies and the humor of the lyrics. The Deal sisters' harmonies have been singled out for praise, and reviewers have described Kim's vocals as rough but also endearing.

"Title TK" begins with "Little Fury", named after a kind of pocketknife sold at truck stops with the word "fury" written along the side of the blade. On the <a href="Call%20and%20response%20%28music%29">call and response</a> track, the Deal sisters sing over a heavy bassline, a funky drumbeat, and guitar sounds influenced by <a href="surf%20music">surf music</a> and <a href="grunge">grunge</a>. J.R. Moores wrote for "<a href="Drowned%20in%20Sound">Drowned in Sound</a>" that "Somebody considers unleashing a guitar solo, yet its notes are few and the vocals kick back in before it has the chance to go anywhere. Is it a solo or a riff? Whatever it is, it flicks its middle finger at other solos and riffs, exposing them as absurd, flamboyant, shallow fripperies. I'm not part of that club, it says." For "<a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>"s Matt Cibula, the repeated line "Hold what you've got" is the Deals' reminder to themselves to keep the Breeders intact henceforth.

On "London Song", Jim Abbott at "<a href="The%20Orlando%20Sentinel">The Orlando Sentinel</a>" said the <a href="Syncopation">syncopated</a> guitar performance complements "Title TK"s "world-weary attitude," just as the sisters' "tough lost years ... [are] obvious from Kim's disconnected delivery on songs about hard times". By contrast, "NY Rock"s Jeanne Fury noted the track's upbeat, quirky energy. In the Japanese release's liner notes, critic <a href="Mia%20Clarke">Mia Clarke</a> described the slow ballad "Off You" as having a lackadaisical feel; "<a href="Pitchfork%20Media">Pitchfork Media</a>"s Will Bryant was struck by the song's creepy quality, and compared it to the mood of the <a href="Pink%20Floyd">Pink Floyd</a> album "<a href="The%20Wall">The Wall</a>". "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>"s Arion Berger said "Off You" is "as direct and heartbreaking as an eighty-five-year-old blues recording, and Kim, her voice clear and full of hope, can't help sounding like a young woman who's lived ten awful lifetimes."

"The She", named after a <a href="nightclub">nightclub</a> that the Deals' brother used to visit, has been described as having a funky feel, with a start-and-stop rhythm of bass and drums. Bryant found the track's keyboard part reminiscent of <a href="Stereolab">Stereolab</a>'s music, while <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>'s Heather Phares likened the entire song to <a href="Jefferson%20Airplane">Jefferson Airplane</a>'s "<a href="White%20Rabbit%20%28Jefferson%20Airplane%20song%29">White Rabbit</a>". Cibula mentioned that the "creepy/cool ... sound [fits] the characteristic Kim Deal familiar/strange lyrics: 'Sorrow blowin' through the vents / I'm over Houston / You're over the night we met.'" Kim Deal plays every instrument on "Too Alive" and both sisters sing. Moores noted the track's buoyant feel and the steady strumming style of Deal's guitar. To Phares, the song possesses an immediacy as though the listener were there watching the performance in person.

Bryant identified "Son of Three" as an example of "when the Breeders set out to rock", noting "the chugging guitars and stomping drums." The Breeders re-recorded "Son of Three" in July 2002 for its release as "Title TK"s third single; this version is faster than the album track, and reflects the speed they were playing the song in concert that year. The lyrics of both "Son of Three" and "The She" suggest extended road trips with unknown outcomes. The album's next song, "Put on a Side", has a distinctive bassline and a cramped, repressive feel. Berger wrote that Kim Deal's "voice grinds sweetly, weariedly, sloppily inside your brain," as she repeats twelve words over the course of the song: "Better I better I stayed up / Better mono, put on a side."

An earlier version of "Full on Idle", "Title TK"s eighth track, was released on the Amps' "Pacer" in 1995. In a 1997 interview, Deal expressed an interest in redoing multiple Amps songs, partially because she did not feel "Pacer" was well recorded. Bryant opined that both versions of "Full on Idle" sound almost the same, but "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>"s <a href="Jessica%20Grose">Jessica Grose</a> wrote that the Breeders' rendition is noticeably slower. In Cibula's view, this version contains elements of <a href="country%20music">country music</a>, <a href="cumbia">cumbia</a>, and <a href="ska">ska</a>. "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>"s Betty Clarke cited the line "Obey your colorist, bleach it all away" as an example of "Title TK"s amusing, off-center lyrics. On "Sinister Foxx", Deal repeatedly sings "Has anyone seen the iguana?" She has explained this as being a reference to buying marijuana: "Have you ever bought a bag of weed? You walk in, and the pot dealer's got an empty <a href="terrarium">terrarium</a> ... Every time I go to a pot dealer's house, there's no iguana." Another line, "I'm in beer class every Thursday night", refers to the alcohol awareness classes that Richard Presley attended after being caught driving while drunk. Phares described the song as having a "sexy menace", and Berger compared the drum part to gunshots and door-knocking.

Moores identified in "Forced to Drive" the "quiet-LOUD-quiet" dynamic for which Deal's former band, the Pixies, are famous. Berger noticed a similar contrast between the song's "pop verses" and "the gloom of a twisty, malignant chorus". For Abbott, this four-chord chorus "approaches exuberance" in its mixture of catchy melody and grunge. The penultimate track, "T and T", was described by Bryant as an instrumental introduction leading into "Huffer". Kelley Deal has stated that these two songs share a thematic union: the latter is about the negative side of <a href="Recreational%20drug%20use%23Inhalants">inhaling paint or other substances</a>, while the former stands for "Toil and Trouble", also about the hardships that inhaling chemicals can cause. "Huffer" is, according to Moores, a lively, poppy track, and critics have commented on its "da-da-da" and "ah-ah" chorus.

"Title TK" was released on May 20 and 21, 2002, on the labels 4AD (United Kingdom), <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra Records</a> (United States), <a href="V2%20Records">V2 Records</a> (Belgium), and <a href="Virgin%20Records">Virgin Records</a> (France); in Japan it came out on May 10 through <a href="P-Vine%20Records">P-Vine Records</a>. The phrase "Title TK" means "<a href="To%20come%20%28publishing%29">title to come</a>" in journalistic shorthand. The album cover was designed by <a href="Vaughan%20Oliver">Vaughan Oliver</a> and Chris Bigg, with additional photography in the packaging by Onie M. Montes; Oliver, who began doing artwork for 4AD in 1980, also designed Breeders' releases including "Pod" and "Last Splash". Three singles were released from "Title TK": "<a href="Off%20You">Off You</a>", "Huffer", and "<a href="Son%20of%20Three">Son of Three</a>"; "Off You" reached number 25 on the Canadian Digital Songs chart, and "Son of Three" number 72 on the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a>. "Title TK" reached the top 100 in the United Kingdom, Australia, France, and Germany. It peaked at number 130 in the United States, where as of June 2004, there were 45,000 units sold.

Most critics responded positively to the album. Critical aggregator <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> gave "Title TK" a score of 71, indicating that the compiled reviews—from 19 critics total—were on the whole favorable. Betty Clarke of "The Guardian" wrote that "Title TK" is "a welcome return to punky pop that knows how to flex some melodic muscle", and singled out the isolation of different sounds as the best aspect of the album. Similarly, "<a href="NME">NME</a>"s John Robinson lauded the distinctive character of the drums, guitar, and vocals. Other positive commentary included praise for Albini’s influence on the album’s sound ("PopMatters"s Matt Cibula), and for the album’s quirky appeal ("<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" critic Brian Garrity).

More negatively, Melanie McFarland of "<a href="The%20Seattle%20Times">The Seattle Times</a>" lamented the too frequent changes in tone from song to song, and considered the album a step backwards from "Last Splash". "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>" magazine's Steve Kandell characterized "Title TK" as "a little unsure of itself", and pointed to the Breeders' re-recording of "Full on Idle" as evidence that "the creative coffers weren't exactly spilling over" for Deal.

The Japanese release contains the following bonus tracks:

Sega Genesis

The Sega Genesis, known as the in regions outside of North America, is a <a href="History%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28fourth%20generation%29">16-bit</a> <a href="home%20video%20game%20console">home video game console</a> developed and sold by <a href="Sega">Sega</a>. The Genesis was Sega's third console and the successor to the <a href="Master%20System">Master System</a>. Sega released the console as the Mega Drive in Japan in 1988, followed by North America as the Genesis in 1989. In 1990, the console was distributed as the Mega Drive by <a href="Virgin%20Mastertronic">Virgin Mastertronic</a> in Europe, <a href="Ozisoft">Ozisoft</a> in <a href="Australasia">Australasia</a>, and <a href="Tectoy">Tec Toy</a> in Brazil. In South Korea, the systems were distributed by <a href="Samsung">Samsung</a> as the Super Gam*Boy and later the Super Aladdin Boy.

Designed by an <a href="Research%20and%20development">R&D</a> team supervised by Hideki Sato and Masami Ishikawa, the hardware was adapted from Sega's <a href="Sega%20System%2016">System 16</a> arcade board, centered on a <a href="Motorola%2068000">Motorola 68000</a> processor as the <a href="central%20processing%20unit">CPU</a>, a <a href="Zilog%20Z80">Zilog Z80</a> as a sound controller, and a video system supporting hardware sprites, tiles, and scrolling. The system plays a <a href="List%20of%20Sega%20Genesis%20games">library of more than 900 games</a> created by Sega and a wide array of third-party publishers and delivered on <a href="ROM%20cartridge">ROM-based cartridges</a>. The Genesis has benefited from several add-ons, including a Power Base Converter to play Master System games, as well as multiple first and third party licensed variations of the console. Sega created two network services to support the Genesis: <a href="Sega%20Meganet">Sega Meganet</a> and <a href="Sega%20Channel">Sega Channel</a>.

In Japan, the Mega Drive did not fare well against its two main competitors, Nintendo's <a href="Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Super Famicom</a> and <a href="NEC">NEC</a>'s <a href="TurboGrafx-16">PC Engine</a>, but it achieved considerable success in North America, Brazil, and Europe. Contributing to its success were its library of <a href="arcade%20game">arcade game</a> <a href="Video%20game%20porting">ports</a>, the popularity of Sega's "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>" series, several popular sports franchises, and aggressive <a href="youth%20marketing">youth marketing</a> that positioned the system as the cool console for adolescents. The release of the <a href="Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a> two years after the Genesis resulted in a fierce battle for market share in the United States and Europe that has often been termed as a "console war" by journalists and historians. As this contest drew increasing attention to the video game industry among the general public, the Genesis and several of its highest-profile games attracted significant legal scrutiny on matters involving reverse engineering and video game violence. <a href="Video%20game%20controversies">Controversy</a> surrounding violent games such as "<a href="Night%20Trap">Night Trap</a>" and "<a href="Mortal%20Kombat%20%281992%20video%20game%29">Mortal Kombat</a>" led Sega to create the <a href="Videogame%20Rating%20Council">Videogame Rating Council</a>, a predecessor to the <a href="Entertainment%20Software%20Rating%20Board">Entertainment Software Rating Board</a>.

30.75 million first-party Genesis units were sold worldwide. In addition, Tec Toy sold an estimated three million licensed variants in Brazil, Majesco projected it would sell 1.5 million licensed variants of the system in the United States, and much smaller numbers were sold by Samsung in South Korea. By the mid-2010s, licensed third-party Genesis rereleases were still being sold by AtGames in North America and Europe. Many games have been rereleased in compilations or on online services such as the <a href="Nintendo%20Virtual%20Console">Nintendo Virtual Console</a>, <a href="Xbox%20Live%20Arcade">Xbox Live Arcade</a>, <a href="PlayStation%20Network">PlayStation Network</a>, and <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a>. The Genesis was succeeded in 1994 by the <a href="Sega%20Saturn">Sega Saturn</a>.

In the early 1980s, <a href="Sega">Sega Enterprises, Inc.</a>, then a subsidiary of <a href="Gulf%20%26amp%3B%20Western">Gulf & Western</a>, was one of the top five <a href="arcade%20game">arcade game</a> manufacturers active in the United States, as company revenues surpassed $200 million between July 1981 and June 1982. A downturn in the arcade business starting in 1982 seriously hurt the company, leading Gulf & Western to sell its North American arcade manufacturing organization and the licensing rights for its arcade games to <a href="Bally%20Manufacturing">Bally Manufacturing</a>. The company retained Sega's North American R&D operation, as well as its Japanese subsidiary, Sega Enterprises, Ltd. With its arcade business in decline, Gulf & Western executives turned to Sega Enterprises, Ltd.'s president, <a href="Hayao%20Nakayama">Hayao Nakayama</a>, for advice on how to proceed. Nakayama advocated that the company leverage its hardware expertise gained through years working in the arcade industry to move into the home console market in Japan, which was in its infancy at the time.

Nakayama received permission to proceed with this project, leading to the release of Sega's first home video game system, the <a href="SG-1000">SG-1000</a>, in July 1983. The SG-1000 was not successful; while it had sold 160,000 units in Japan, far greater than any of Sega's arcade platforms, sales at stores were dominated by <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>'s <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Famicom</a> which had been released the same day. Sega estimated that the Family Computer outsold the SG-1000 by a 10-to-1 margin. The SG-1000 was replaced by the <a href="Sega%20Master%20System">Sega Mark III</a> within two years. In the meantime, Gulf & Western began to divest itself of its non-core businesses after the death of company founder <a href="Charles%20Bluhdorn">Charles Bluhdorn</a>, so Nakayama and former Sega CEO <a href="David%20Rosen%20%28business%29">David Rosen</a> arranged a <a href="management%20buyout">management buyout</a> of the Japanese subsidiary in 1984 with financial backing from CSK Corporation, a prominent Japanese software company. Nakayama was then installed as CEO of the new Sega Enterprises, Ltd.

In 1986, Sega redesigned the Mark III for release in North America as the Sega Master System. This was followed by a European release the next year. Although the Master System was a success in Europe, and later in Brazil, it failed to ignite significant interest in the Japanese or North American markets, which, by the mid-to-late 1980s, were both dominated by <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>. With Sega continuing to have difficulty penetrating the home market, Sega's console R&D team, led by Masami Ishikawa and supervised by Hideki Sato, began work on a successor to the Master System almost immediately after that console launched.

In 1987, Sega faced another threat to its console business when Japanese computer giant <a href="NEC">NEC</a> released the <a href="PC%20Engine">PC Engine</a> amid great publicity. To remain competitive against the two more established consumer electronics companies, Ishikawa and his team decided they needed to incorporate a <a href="16-bit">16-bit</a> microprocessor into their new system to make an impact in the marketplace and once again turned to Sega's strengths in the arcade industry to adapt the successful <a href="Sega%20System%2016">Sega System 16</a> arcade board into architecture for a home console. The decision to use a <a href="Motorola%2068000">Motorola 68000</a> as the system's main CPU was made late in development, while a <a href="Zilog%20Z80">Zilog Z80</a> was used as a secondary CPU to handle the sound due to fears that the load to the main CPU would be too great if it handled both the visuals and the audio. The 68000 chip was expensive and would have driven the retail price of the console up greatly, but Sega was able to negotiate a sale with a distributor for obtaining the chips for a tenth of their price on an up-front volume sale with the promise of potentially more if the console was successful.

First announced in June 1988 in "Beep!", a Japanese gaming magazine, the developing console was referred to as the "Mark V", but Sega management felt the need for a stronger name. After reviewing more than 300 proposals, the company settled on "Mega Drive". In North America, the name of the console was changed to "Genesis". The reason for this change is not known, but it may have been due to a trademark dispute.

Sega released the Mega Drive in Japan on October 29, 1988, though the launch was overshadowed by Nintendo's release of "<a href="Super%20Mario%20Bros.%203">Super Mario Bros. 3</a>" a week earlier. Positive coverage from magazines "<a href="Famitsu">Famitsu</a>" and "Beep!" helped to establish a following, but Sega only managed to ship 400,000 units in the first year. In order to increase sales, Sega released various peripherals and games, including an online banking system and <a href="answering%20machine">answering machine</a> called the Sega Mega Anser. Nevertheless, the Mega Drive was unable to overtake the venerable <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Famicom</a> and remained a distant third in Japan behind Nintendo's <a href="Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Super Famicom</a> and NEC's PC Engine throughout the 16-bit era.

Sega announced a North American release date for the system on January 9, 1989. At the time, Sega did not possess a North American sales and marketing organization and was distributing its Master System through <a href="Tonka">Tonka</a>. Dissatisfied with Tonka's performance, Sega looked for a new partner to market the Genesis in North America and offered the rights to <a href="Atari%20Corporation">Atari Corporation</a>, which did not yet have a 16-bit system. David Rosen made the proposal to Atari CEO <a href="Jack%20Tramiel">Jack Tramiel</a> and the president of Atari's Entertainment Electronics Division, Michael Katz. Tramiel declined to acquire the new console, deeming it too expensive, and instead opted to focus on the <a href="Atari%20ST">Atari ST</a>. Sega decided to launch the console through its own Sega of America subsidiary, which executed a limited launch on August 14, 1989, in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> and <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. The Sega Genesis was released in the rest of North America later that year.

The European version was released in September 1990, at a price of <a href="Pound%20sterling">GB₤</a>189.99. The release was handled by <a href="Virgin%20Mastertronic">Virgin Mastertronic</a>, which was later purchased by Sega in 1991 and became Sega of Europe. Games like "<a href="Space%20Harrier%20II">Space Harrier II</a>", "<a href="Ghouls%20%27n%20Ghosts">Ghouls 'n Ghosts</a>", "<a href="Golden%20Axe">Golden Axe</a>", "<a href="Super%20Thunder%20Blade">Super Thunder Blade</a>", and "<a href="The%20Revenge%20of%20Shinobi">The Revenge of Shinobi</a>" were available in stores at launch. The console was also bundled with "<a href="Altered%20Beast">Altered Beast</a>". The Mega Drive and its first batch of games were shown at the 1990 European Computer Entertainment Show (ECES) in <a href="Earl%27s%20Court">Earl's Court</a>. Between July and August 1990, Virgin initially placed their order for 20,000 Mega Drive units. However, the company increased the order by 10,000 units when advanced orders had exceeded expectations, and another 10,000 units was later added following the console's success at the ECES event. The projected number of units to be sold between September and December 1990 had eventually increased to 40,000 units in the United Kingdom alone.

Other companies assisted in distributing the console to various countries worldwide. <a href="Ozisoft">Ozisoft</a> handled the Mega Drive's launch and marketing in Australia, as it had done before with the Master System. In Brazil, the Mega Drive was released by <a href="Tectoy">Tectoy</a> in 1990, only a year after the Brazilian release of the Master System. Tec Toy produced games exclusively for the Brazilian market and began a network service for the system called <a href="Sega%20Meganet">Sega Meganet</a> in 1995. In India, Sega entered a distribution deal with <a href="Shaw%20Wallace">Shaw Wallace</a> in the spring of 1995 in order to circumvent an 80% import tariff, with each unit selling for <a href="Indian%20rupee">INR₹</a>18,000. <a href="Samsung">Samsung</a> handled sales and distribution in <a href="Korea">Korea</a>, where it was renamed the "Super Gam*Boy" and retained the Mega Drive logo alongside the Samsung name. It was later renamed "Super Aladdin Boy".

For the North American market, former Atari Corporation Entertainment Electronics Division president and new Sega of America CEO Michael Katz instituted a two-part approach to build sales in the region. The first part involved a marketing campaign to challenge Nintendo head-on and emphasize the more arcade-like experience available on the Genesis, summarized by slogans including "Genesis does what Nintendon't". Since Nintendo owned the console rights to most arcade games of the time, the second part involved creating a library of instantly recognizable games which used the names and likenesses of celebrities and athletes such as "<a href="Pat%20Riley%20Basketball">Pat Riley Basketball</a>", "<a href="Arnold%20Palmer%20Tournament%20Golf">Arnold Palmer Tournament Golf</a>", "<a href="James%20%27Buster%27%20Douglas%20Knockout%20Boxing">James 'Buster' Douglas Knockout Boxing</a>", "<a href="Joe%20Montana%20Football">Joe Montana Football</a>", "<a href="Tommy%20Lasorda%20Baseball">Tommy Lasorda Baseball</a>", "Mario Lemieux Hockey", and "<a href="Michael%20Jackson%27s%20Moonwalker">Michael Jackson's Moonwalker</a>". Nonetheless, it had a hard time overcoming Nintendo's ubiquitous presence in consumers' homes. Tasked by Nakayama to sell one million units within the first year, Katz and Sega of America managed to sell only 500,000 units.

In mid-1990, Nakayama hired <a href="Tom%20Kalinske">Tom Kalinske</a> to replace Katz as CEO of Sega of America. Although Kalinske initially knew little about the video game market, he surrounded himself with industry-savvy advisors. A believer in the <a href="razor%20and%20blades%20business%20model">razor and blades business model</a>, he developed a four-point plan: cut the price of the console, create a U.S.-based team to develop games targeted at the American market, continue and expand the aggressive advertising campaigns, and replace the bundled game "Altered Beast" with a new game, "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%281991%20video%20game%29">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>". The Japanese board of directors initially disapproved of the plan, but all four points were approved by Nakayama, who told Kalinske, "I hired you to make the decisions for Europe and the Americas, so go ahead and do it." Magazines praised "Sonic" as one of the greatest games yet made, and Sega's console finally took off as customers who had been waiting for the release of the international version of Nintendo's Super Famicom—the <a href="Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a> or SNES—decided to purchase a Genesis instead. Nintendo's console debuted against an established competitor, while NEC's <a href="TurboGrafx-16">TurboGrafx-16</a> failed to gain traction, and NEC soon pulled out of the market. In large part due to the popularity of "Sonic the Hedgehog", the Sega Genesis outsold the SNES in the United States nearly two to one during the 1991 holiday season. This success led to Sega having control of 65% of the <a href="History%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28fourth%20generation%29">16-bit</a> <a href="Video%20game%20console">console</a> market in January 1992, making it the first time Nintendo was not the console leader since December 1985.

To compete with Nintendo, Sega was more open to new types of games than its rival, but still tightly controlled the approval process for third-party games and charged high prices for cartridge manufacturing. Technicians from American third-party video game publisher <a href="Electronic%20Arts">Electronic Arts</a> (EA) reverse engineered the Genesis in 1989, following nearly one year of negotiations with Sega in which EA requested a more liberal licensing agreement than was standard in the industry before releasing its games for the system. The <a href="Clean%20room%20design">clean room</a> reverse engineering was led by Steve Hayes and Jim Nitchals, lasting several months before EA secretly began game development. EA founder <a href="Trip%20Hawkins">Trip Hawkins</a> confronted Nakayama with this information one day prior to the 1990 <a href="Consumer%20Electronics%20Show">Consumer Electronics Show</a> (CES), noting that EA had the ability to run its own licensing program if Sega refused to meet its demands. Sega relented, and the next day EA's upcoming Genesis games were showcased at CES. EA signed what Hawkins described as "a very unusual and much more enlightened license agreement" with Sega in June 1990: "Among other things, we had the right to make as many titles as we wanted. We could approve our own titles ... the royalty rates were a lot more reasonable. We also had more direct control over manufacturing." After the deal was in place, EA chief creative officer <a href="Bing%20Gordon">Bing Gordon</a> learned that "we hadn't figured out all the workarounds" and "Sega still had the ability to lock us out," noting "It just would have been a public relations fiasco." EA released its first two Genesis games, "<a href="Populous%20%28video%20game%29">Populous</a>" and "", within the month. The first Genesis version of EA's "<a href="John%20Madden%20Football%20%281990%20video%20game%29">John Madden Football</a>" arrived before the end of 1990, and became what Gordon called a "<a href="Killer%20application">killer app</a>" for the system. Taking advantage of the licensing agreement, Gordon and EA's vice president of marketing services Nancy Fong created a visual identifier for EA's Genesis cartridges: A yellow stripe on their left side added during manufacturing.

Sega was able to outsell Nintendo four Christmas seasons in a row due to the Genesis' head start, a lower price point, and a larger library of games when compared to the Super Nintendo at its release. Sega had ten games for every game on SNES, and while the SNES had an exclusive version of "<a href="Final%20Fight%20%28video%20game%29">Final Fight</a>", one of Sega's internal development teams created "<a href="Streets%20of%20Rage">Streets of Rage</a>", which had bigger levels, tougher enemies, and a well-regarded soundtrack. <a href="ASCII%20Entertainment">ASCII Entertainment</a> reported in the spring of 1993 that Genesis had 250 games versus 75 for Super Nintendo, but limited shelf space meant that stores typically offered 100 Genesis and 50 Super Nintendo games. The NES was still the leader, with 300 games and 100 on shelves.

Sega's advertising positioned the Genesis as the cooler console, and as its advertising evolved, the company coined the term "blast processing" (the origin of which is an obscure programming trick on the graphics hardware) to suggest that its processing capabilities were far greater than those of the SNES. A <a href="Sony">Sony</a> focus group found that teenage boys would not admit to owning a SNES rather than a Genesis. With the Genesis often outselling the SNES at a ratio of 2:1, Nintendo and Sega both focused heavily on <a href="impression%20management">impression management</a> of the market, even going to the point of deception, with Nintendo claiming it had sold more consoles in 1991 than it actually had, and forecasting it would sell 6 million consoles by the end of 1992, while its actual U.S. install base at the end of 1992 was only just more than 4 million units. Due to these tactics, it was difficult to ascertain a clear leader in market share for several years at a time, with Nintendo's dollar share of the U.S. 16-bit market dipping down from 60% at the end of 1992 to 37% at the end of 1993, Sega claiming 55% of all 16-bit hardware sales during 1994, and "<a href="Donkey%20Kong%20Country">Donkey Kong Country</a>" helping the SNES to outsell the Genesis from 1995 through 1997. According to a 2004 study of <a href="NPD%20Group">NPD sales data</a>, the Sega Genesis was able to maintain its lead over the Super NES in the American 16-bit console market. However, according to a 2014 <a href="Wedbush%20Securities">Wedbush Securities</a> report based on revised NPD sales data, the SNES outsold the Genesis in the U.S. market.

While Sega was seeking a flagship series to compete with Nintendo's <a href="Mario%20%28franchise%29">Mario series</a> along with a character to serve as a company mascot, several character designs were submitted as part of a company-wide contest, including "an <a href="anime">anime</a>-inspired egg and a teal hedgehog with red shoes created by <a href="Naoto%20Ohshima">Naoto Ohshima</a> that he called Mr. Needlemouse." This character won the contest and was renamed Sonic the Hedgehog, spawning <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20video%20game%20franchises">one of the best-selling video game franchises</a> in history. The gameplay of "Sonic the Hedgehog" originated with a tech demo created by <a href="Yuji%20Naka">Yuji Naka</a>, who had developed an algorithm that allowed a sprite to move smoothly on a curve by determining its position with a <a href="dot%20matrix">dot matrix</a>. Naka's original prototype was a platform game that involved a fast-moving character rolling in a ball through a long winding tube, and this concept was subsequently fleshed out with Ohshima's character design and levels conceived by designer <a href="Hirokazu%20Yasuhara">Hirokazu Yasuhara</a>. Sonic's blue pigmentation was chosen to match Sega's cobalt blue logo, and his shoes were a concept evolved from a design inspired by <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>'s boots with the addition of the color red, which was inspired by both <a href="Santa%20Claus">Santa Claus</a> and the contrast of those colors on Jackson's 1987 album "<a href="Bad%20%28album%29">Bad</a>"; his personality was based on <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>'s "can do" attitude.

Although Katz and Sega of America's marketing experts disliked the idea of "Sonic", certain that it would not catch on with most American kids, Kalinske's strategy to place "Sonic the Hedgehog" as the pack-in game paid off. Featuring speedy gameplay, "Sonic the Hedgehog" greatly increased the popularity of the Sega Genesis in North America. Bundling "Sonic the Hedgehog" with the Sega Genesis is credited with helping Sega gain 65% of the market share against Nintendo.

After the release of the Sega Genesis in 1989, video game publisher <a href="Accolade%20%28company%29">Accolade</a> began exploring options to release some of their <a href="PC%20game">PC game</a>s on the console. At the time, Sega had a licensing deal in place for <a href="Video%20game%20developers%23Third-party%20developers">third-party developers</a> that increased the costs to the developer. According to Accolade co-founder <a href="Alan%20Miller%20%28game%20designer%29">Alan Miller</a>, "One pays them between $10 and $15 per cartridge on top of the real hardware manufacturing costs, so it about doubles the cost of goods to the independent publisher." To get around licensing, Accolade chose to seek an alternative way to bring their games to the Genesis. It did so by purchasing one in order to <a href="Decompiler">decompile</a> the <a href="executable">executable code</a> of three Genesis games. Such information was used to program their new Genesis cartridges in a way that would allow them to disable the security lockouts on the Genesis that prevented unlicensed games from being able to be played. This strategy was used successfully to bring "" to the Genesis in 1990. To do so, Accolade had copied Sega's copyrighted game code multiple times in order to reverse engineer the software of Sega's licensed Genesis games.

As a result of piracy in some countries and unlicensed development issues, Sega incorporated a technical protection mechanism into a new edition of the Genesis released in 1990, referred to as the Genesis III. This new variation of the Genesis included a code known as the Trademark Security System (TMSS), which, when a game cartridge was inserted, would check for the presence of the <a href="String%20%28computer%20science%29">string</a> "SEGA" at a particular point in the memory contained in the cartridge. If the string was present, the console would run the game, and would briefly display the message: "" This system had a twofold effect: it added extra protection against unlicensed developers and software piracy, and forced the Sega trademark to display when the game was powered up, making a lawsuit for trademark infringement possible if unlicensed software were to be developed. Accolade learned of this development at the <a href="International%20CES">Winter Consumer Electronics Show</a> in January 1991, where Sega showed the new Genesis III and demonstrated it screening and rejecting an "Ishido" game cartridge. With more games planned for the following year, Accolade successfully identified the TMSS file. It later added this file to the games "<a href="HardBall%21">HardBall!</a>", "<a href="Star%20Control">Star Control</a>", "Mike Ditka Power Football", and "<a href="Turrican">Turrican</a>".

In response to the creation of these unlicensed games, Sega filed suit against Accolade in the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Northern%20District%20of%20California">United States District Court for the Northern District of California</a>, on charges of trademark infringement, <a href="unfair%20competition">unfair competition</a>, and copyright infringement. In response, Accolade filed a counterclaim for falsifying the source of its games by displaying the Sega trademark when the game was powered up. Although the district court initially ruled for Sega and issued an injunction preventing Accolade from continuing to reverse engineer the Genesis, Accolade appealed the verdict to the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Ninth%20Circuit">United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a>.

As a result of the appeal, the Ninth Circuit overturned the district court's verdict and ruled that Accolade's decompilation of the Sega software constituted fair use. The court's written opinion followed on October 20, 1992, and noted that the use of the software was non-exploitative, although commercial. Further, the court found that the trademark infringement, being required by the TMSS for a Genesis game to run on the system, had been inadvertently triggered by a fair use act and was the fault of Sega for having caused false labeling. Ultimately, Sega and Accolade settled the case on April 30, 1993. As a part of this settlement, Accolade became an official licensee of Sega, and later developed and released "<a href="Barkley%20Shut%20Up%20and%20Jam%21">Barkley Shut Up and Jam!</a>" while under license. The terms of the licensing, including whether or not any special arrangements or discounts were made to Accolade, were not released to the public. The financial terms of the settlement were also not disclosed, although both companies agreed to pay their own legal costs.

In 1993, the American media began to focus on the mature content of certain video games. Games such as "<a href="Night%20Trap">Night Trap</a>" for the <a href="Sega%20CD">Sega CD</a>, an <a href="video%20game%20accessory">add-on</a>, received unprecedented scrutiny. Issues about "Night Trap" were brought up in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, with former Sega of Europe development director Mike Brogan noting that ""Night Trap" got Sega an awful lot of publicity ... it was also cited in <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">UK Parliament</a> for being classified as "15" due to its use of real actors." This came at a time when Sega was capitalizing on its image as an edgy company with attitude, and this only reinforced that image. By far the year's most controversial game was <a href="Midway%20Games">Midway</a>'s <a href="Mortal%20Kombat%20%281992%20video%20game%29">"Mortal Kombat"</a>, ported to the Genesis and SNES by <a href="Acclaim%20Entertainment">Acclaim Entertainment</a>. In response to public outcry over the game's graphic violence, Nintendo decided to replace the blood in the game with "sweat" and the arcade's gruesome "fatalities" with less violent finishing moves. Sega took a different approach, instituting America's first video game ratings system, the <a href="Videogame%20Rating%20Council">Videogame Rating Council</a> (VRC), for all its current systems. Ratings ranged from the family friendly GA rating to the more mature rating of MA-13, and the adults-only rating of MA-17. With the rating system in place, Sega released its version of "Mortal Kombat", appearing to have removed all the blood and sweat effects and toning down the finishing moves even more than in the SNES version. However, all the arcade's blood and uncensored finishing moves could be enabled by entering a "Blood Code". This technicality allowed Sega to release the game with a relatively low MA-13 rating. Meanwhile, the tamer SNES version shipped without a rating.

The Genesis version of "Mortal Kombat" was well-received by gaming press, as well as fans, outselling the SNES version three- or four-to-one, while Nintendo was criticized for censoring the SNES version of the game. Executive vice president of Nintendo of America <a href="Howard%20Lincoln">Howard Lincoln</a> was quick to point out at the hearings that "Night Trap" had no such rating, saying to Senator <a href="Joe%20Lieberman">Joe Lieberman</a>:

In response, Sega of America vice president Bill White showed a videotape of violent video games on the SNES and stressed the importance of rating video games. At the end of the hearing, Lieberman called for another hearing in February 1994 to check on progress toward a rating system for video game violence.

As a result of the Congressional hearings, "Night Trap" started to generate more sales and released ports to the <a href="Personal%20computer">PC</a>, <a href="32X">Sega 32X</a>, and <a href="3DO%20Interactive%20Multiplayer">3DO</a>. According to <a href="Digital%20Pictures">Digital Pictures</a> founder Tom Zito, "You know, I sold 50,000 units of "Night Trap" a week after those hearings." Although experiencing increased sales, Sega decided to recall "Night Trap" and re-release it with revisions in 1994 due to the Congressional hearings. After the close of these hearings, video game manufacturers came together to establish the rating system that Lieberman had called for. Initially, Sega proposed the universal adoption of its system, but after objections by Nintendo and others, Sega took a role in forming a new one. This became the <a href="Entertainment%20Software%20Rating%20Board">Entertainment Software Rating Board</a>, an independent organization that received praise from Lieberman. With this new rating system in place, Nintendo decided its censorship policies were no longer needed, and the SNES port of "<a href="Mortal%20Kombat%20II">Mortal Kombat II</a>" was released uncensored.

In order to extend the life of the Genesis, Sega released two add-ons to increase its capabilities: a CD-based peripheral known as the <a href="Sega%20CD">Sega CD</a> (Mega-CD outside North America), and a 32-bit peripheral known as the <a href="Sega%2032X">Sega 32X</a>. 2.24 million Sega CD units were sold worldwide, and an estimated 665,000 32X units were sold by the end of 1994.

Following the launch of the next-generation 32-bit Sony <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a> and <a href="Sega%20Saturn">Sega Saturn</a>, sales of 16-bit hardware and software continued to account for 64% of the video game market in 1995. Sega underestimated the continued popularity of the Genesis and did not have the inventory to meet demand for the product. Sega was able to capture 43% of the dollar share of the U.S. video game market and claimed to have sold more than 2 million Genesis units in 1995, while Genesis software such as "<a href="Vectorman">Vectorman</a>" remained highly successful, but Kalinske estimated that "we could have sold another 300,000 Genesis systems in the November/December timeframe." Nakayama's decision to focus on the Saturn over the Genesis, based on the systems' relative performance in Japan, has been cited as the major contributing factor in this miscalculation. By contrast, Nintendo concentrated on the 16-bit home console market, as well as its successful <a href="handheld%20video%20game%20console">handheld</a>, the <a href="Game%20Boy">Game Boy</a>. As a result, Nintendo took in 42% of the video game market dollar share, without launching a 32-bit console to compete directly with the PlayStation or the Saturn. Following tensions with Sega Enterprises, Ltd. over its focus on the Saturn, Kalinske, who oversaw the rise of the Genesis in 1991, grew uninterested in the business and resigned in mid-1996.

Sega sold 30.75 million Genesis units worldwide. Of these, 3.58 million were sold in Japan, and sales in Europe and the U.S. are roughly estimated at 8 million and 18–18.5 million as of June 1997 (at which time Sega was no longer manufacturing the system) respectively. In 1998, Sega licensed the Genesis to <a href="Majesco%20Entertainment">Majesco Entertainment</a> in North America so it could re-release the console. Majesco began reselling millions of formerly unsold cartridges at a budget price, together with 150,000 units of the second model of the Genesis. It released the Sega Genesis 3, projecting to sell 1.5 million units of the console by the end of 1998. An estimated 3 million Genesis units were sold by Tec Toy in Brazil.

The main <a href="microprocessor">microprocessor</a> is a 16/32-bit <a href="Motorola%2068000">Motorola 68000</a> <a href="central%20processing%20unit">CPU</a> clocked at 7.6 <a href="Hertz">MHz</a>. The console uses a <a href="Zilog%20Z80">Zilog Z80</a> sub-processor, mainly used to control the sound hardware and provide <a href="backward%20compatibility">backward compatibility</a> with the Master System. The system has 72 <a href="kilobyte">kB</a> of <a href="random%20access%20memory">RAM</a>, 64 kB of <a href="video%20RAM">video RAM</a>, and can display up to 61 colors at once from a <a href="Palette%20%28computing%29">palette</a> of 512. The games are in <a href="ROM%20cartridge">ROM cartridge</a> format and inserted in the top.

The system produces sound using a <a href="Yamaha%20YM2612">Yamaha YM2612</a> <a href="Frequency%20modulation">FM</a> synthesizer and a <a href="Texas%20Instruments%20SN76489">Texas Instruments SN76489</a> <a href="programmable%20sound%20generator">PSG</a>; the latter is integrated with the <a href="Video%20Display%20Controller">Video Display Processor (VDP)</a>. The Z80 processor is primarily used to control both sound chips to produce stereo music and sound effects. Most revisions of the original system contain a discrete YM2612 and a separate YM7101 VDP; the functionality of these two chips was later integrated into a single custom <a href="Application-specific%20integrated%20circuit">ASIC</a> (FC1004) for the model 2 and later revisions.

The back of the model 1 console provides a <a href="radio%20frequency">radio frequency</a> output port (designed for use with antenna and cable systems) and a specialized 8-pin <a href="DIN">DIN</a> port, both of which provide video and audio output. Both outputs produce <a href="Monophony">monophonic</a> sound; a <a href="Phone%20connector%20%28audio%29">headphone jack</a> on the front of the console produces <a href="stereo">stereo</a> sound. On the model 2, the DIN port, radio frequency output port, and headphone jack are replaced by a 9-pin <a href="mini-DIN">mini-DIN</a> port on the back for <a href="composite%20video">composite video</a>, <a href="RGBS">RGB</a> and stereo sound, and the standard RF switch. Earlier model 1 consoles have a 9-pin extension port, although this was removed in later production runs and is absent in the model 2. An <a href="edge%20connector">edge connector</a> on the bottom-right of the console allows it to be connected to a peripheral.

The standard controller features a rounded shape, a <a href="directional%20pad">directional pad</a>, three main buttons, and a "start" button. Sega later released a six-button version in 1993. This pad is slightly smaller and features three additional face buttons, similar to the design of buttons on some popular arcade fighting games such as "<a href="Street%20Fighter%20II">Street Fighter II</a>". The third model of the controller, MK-1470 was released with the Sega Genesis Model 3, with a switch between Normal, Turbo, and Slow while also having the Mode button. Sega released a wireless revision of the six-button controller, the Remote Arcade Pad.

The system is backward compatible with the Master System. The first peripheral released, the Power Base Converter (Master System Converter in Europe), allows Master System games to be played. A second model, the Master System Converter 2, was released only in Europe for use with the Mega Drive II.

Other peripherals were released to add functionality. The <a href="Menacer">Menacer</a> is a wireless, infrared <a href="light%20gun">light gun</a> peripheral used with compatible games. Other third parties created light gun peripherals for the Genesis, such as the <a href="American%20Laser%20Games">American Laser Games</a> Pistol and the <a href="Konami">Konami</a> Justifier. Released for art creation software, the Sega Mega Mouse features three buttons and is only compatible with a few games, such as "<a href="Eye%20of%20the%20Beholder%20%28video%20game%29">Eye of the Beholder</a>". A foam-covered bat called the <a href="BatterUP">BatterUP</a> and the TeeVGolf golf club were released for both the Genesis and SNES.

In November 1993, Sega released the Sega Activator, an octagonal device that lies flat on the floor and was designed to translate the player's physical movements into game inputs. Several high-profile games, including "Mortal Kombat" and "", were adapted to support the peripheral. The device was a commercial failure, due mainly to its inaccuracy and its high price point. <a href="IGN">IGN</a> editor Craig Harris ranked the Sega Activator the third worst video game controller ever made.

Both EA and Sega released <a href="multitap">multitap</a>s to allow more than the standard two players to play at once. Initially, EA's version, the 4 Way Play, and Sega's adapter, the Team Player, only supported each publisher's games. In response to complaints about this, Sega publicly stated, "We have been working hard to resolve this problem since we learned of it", and that a new Team Player which would work with all multitap games for the console would be released shortly. Later games were created to work on both the 4 Way Play and Team Player. <a href="Codemasters">Codemasters</a> also developed the <a href="J-Cart">J-Cart</a> system, providing two extra ports on the cartridge itself, although the technology came late in the console's life and is only featured on a few games. Sega planned to release a <a href="Racing%20wheel">steering wheel peripheral</a> in 1994, and the Genesis version of "<a href="Virtua%20Racing">Virtua Racing</a>" was advertised as being "steering wheel compatible," but the peripheral was cancelled.

In its first foray into <a href="Online%20console%20gaming">online gaming</a>, Sega created <a href="Sega%20Meganet">Sega Meganet</a>, which debuted in Japan on November 3, 1990. Operating through a cartridge and a peripheral called the "Mega <a href="Modem">Modem</a>," this allowed Mega Drive players to play a total of seventeen games online. A North American version, dubbed "Tele-Genesis," was announced but never released. Another phone-based system, the Mega Anser, turned the Japanese Mega Drive into an online banking terminal.

In 1994, Sega started the <a href="Sega%20Channel">Sega Channel</a>, a game distribution system using <a href="cable%20television">cable television</a> services <a href="Time%20Warner%20Cable">Time Warner Cable</a> and <a href="Tele-Communications%20Inc.">TCI</a>. Using a special peripheral, Genesis players could download a game from a library of fifty each month and demos for upcoming releases. Games were downloaded to internal memory and deleted when the console was powered off. The Sega Channel reached 250,000 subscribers at its peak and ran until July 31, 1998, well past the release of the Sega Saturn.

In an effort to compete with Sega, third-party developer Catapult Entertainment created the <a href="XBAND">XBAND</a>, a peripheral which allowed Genesis players to engage in online competitive gaming. Using telephone services to share data, XBAND was initially offered in five U.S. cities in November 1994. The following year, the service was extended to the SNES, and Catapult teamed up with <a href="Blockbuster%20Video">Blockbuster Video</a> to market the service, but as interest in the service waned, it was discontinued in April 1997.

The Genesis library was initially modest, but eventually grew to contain games to appeal to all types of players. The initial pack-in game was "<a href="Altered%20Beast">Altered Beast</a>", which was later replaced with "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%281991%20video%20game%29">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>" in 1991. Top sellers included "Sonic the Hedgehog", its sequel "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%202">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a>", and "<a href="Disney%27s%20Aladdin%20%28Virgin%20Games%20video%20game%29">Disney's Aladdin</a>". During development for the console, Sega Enterprises focused on developing <a href="action%20game">action game</a>s, while Sega of America was tasked with developing <a href="sports%20game">sports game</a>s. A large part of the appeal of the Genesis library during the console's lifetime was the <a href="arcade%20game">arcade</a>-based experience of its games, as well as more difficult entries such as "<a href="Ecco%20the%20Dolphin">Ecco the Dolphin</a>", and sports games such as "<a href="Joe%20Montana%20Football">Joe Montana Football</a>". Compared to its competition, Sega advertised to an older audience by hosting more mature games, including the uncensored version of "<a href="Mortal%20Kombat%20%281992%20video%20game%29">Mortal Kombat</a>".

Initially, the Genesis suffered from limited third-party support due to its low market share and Nintendo's monopolizing practices. Notably, the arcade hit "<a href="Street%20Fighter%20II">Street Fighter II</a>" by <a href="Capcom">Capcom</a> initially skipped the Genesis, instead only being released on the SNES. However, as the Genesis continued to grow in popularity, Capcom eventually ported a version of "Street Fighter II" to the system known as "", that would go on to sell over a million copies. One of the biggest third-party companies to support the Genesis early on was Electronic Arts. <a href="Trip%20Hawkins">Trip Hawkins</a>, founder and then president of EA, believed the Genesis faster drawing speed made it more suitable for sport games than the SNES, and credits EA's success on the Genesis for helping catapult the EA Sports brand. Another third-party blockbuster for the system was the port of the original "Mortal Kombat". Although the arcade game was released on the SNES and Genesis simultaneously, the two ports were not identical. The SNES version looked closer to the arcade game, but the Genesis version allowed players to bypass censorship, helping make it more popular. In 1997, Sega of America claimed the Genesis had a software <a href="attach%20rate">attach rate</a> of 16 games sold per console, double that of the SNES.

On the Super NES, companies could add <a href="List%20of%20Super%20NES%20enhancement%20chips">enhancement chips</a> to cartridges to increase the console's capabilities and produce more advanced graphics; for example, the launch game "<a href="Pilotwings">Pilotwings</a>" contained a <a href="digital%20signal%20processor">digital signal processor</a>. Later, the <a href="Super%20FX">Super FX</a> chip was designed to offload complex rendering tasks from the main CPU. It was first used in "<a href="Star%20Fox%20%281993%20video%20game%29">Star Fox</a>", which renders 3D polygons in real time, and "" demonstrates rotation, scaling, and stretching of individual sprites and manipulates large areas of the screen.

Sega began work on an enhancement chip to compete with the Super FX, resulting in the Sega Virtua Processor. This chip enables the Genesis to render polygons in real time and provides an "Axis Transformation" unit that handles scaling and rotation. "<a href="Virtua%20Racing">Virtua Racing</a>", the only game released with this chip, runs at a significantly higher and more stable frame rate than similar games on the SNES. The chip was expensive to produce, and increased the cost of the games that used it. At , "Virtua Racing" was the most expensive Genesis cartridge ever produced. Two other games, "<a href="Virtua%20Fighter%20%28arcade%20game%29">Virtua Fighter</a>" and "<a href="Daytona%20USA%20%28arcade%20game%29">Daytona USA</a>", were planned for the SVP chip, but were instead moved into the Saturn's launch line-up. There were plans to sell the SVP chip as a separate upgrade module for the Genesis, but this module was never released.

In addition to accessories such as the Power Base Converter, the Sega Genesis supports two add-ons that each support their own game libraries. The first is the Sega CD (known as the Mega-CD in all regions except for North America), a <a href="compact%20disc">compact disc</a>-based peripheral that can play its library of games in <a href="CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a> format. The second is the Sega 32X, a <a href="32-bit">32-bit</a> peripheral which uses ROM cartridges and serves as a pass-through for Genesis games. Sega produced a custom <a href="power%20strip">power strip</a> to fit the peripherals' large <a href="AC%20adapter">AC adapter</a>s. Both add-ons were officially discontinued in 1996.

By 1991, compact discs had gained in popularity as a <a href="data%20storage%20device">data storage device</a> for music and software. PCs and video game companies had started to make use of this technology. NEC had been the first to include CD technology in a game console with the release of the <a href="TurboGrafx-CD">TurboGrafx-CD</a> add-on, and Nintendo was making plans to develop <a href="Super%20NES%20CD-ROM">its own CD peripheral</a> as well. Seeing the opportunity to gain an advantage over its rivals, Sega partnered with <a href="JVC">JVC</a> to develop a CD-ROM add-on for the Genesis. Sega launched the Mega-CD in Japan on December 1, 1991, initially retailing at <a href="Japanese%20yen">JP¥</a>49,800. The CD add-on was launched in North America on October 15, 1992, as the Sega CD, with a retail price of <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>299; it was released in Europe as the Mega-CD in 1993. In addition to greatly expanding the potential size of its games, this add-on unit upgraded the graphics and sound capabilities by adding a second, more powerful processor, more system memory, and hardware-based <a href="scaling%20%28geometry%29">scaling</a> and <a href="rotation">rotation</a> similar to that found in Sega's arcade games. It provided battery-backed storage RAM to allow games to save high scores, configuration data, and game progress.

Shortly after its launch in North America, Sega began shipping the Sega CD with the pack-in game "<a href="Sewer%20Shark">Sewer Shark</a>", a <a href="full%20motion%20video">full motion video</a> (FMV) game developed by <a href="Digital%20Pictures">Digital Pictures</a>, a company that became an important partner for Sega. Touting the benefits of the CD's comparatively vast storage space, Sega and its third-party developers produced <a href="List%20of%20Sega%20CD%20games">a number of games for the add-on</a> that include digital video in their gameplay or as bonus content, as well as re-releasing several cartridge-based games with high-fidelity audio tracks. In 1993, Sega released the Sega CD 2, a smaller and lighter version of the add-on designed for the Genesis II, at a reduced price compared to the original. A limited number of games were later developed that use both the Sega CD and the <a href="Sega%2032X">Sega 32X</a> add-ons.

The Mega-CD sold only 100,000 units during its first year in Japan, falling well below expectations. Although many consumers blamed the add-on's high launch price, it also suffered from a tiny software library; only two games were available at launch. This was due in part to the long delay before Sega made its software development kit available to third-party developers. Sales were more successful in North America and Europe, although the novelty of FMV and CD-enhanced games quickly wore off as many of the system's later games were met with lukewarm or negative reviews. In 1995, Sega announced a shift in focus to its new console, the Saturn, and discontinued all advertising for Genesis hardware, including the Sega CD. The add-on sold 2.24 million units worldwide.

With the release of the Sega Saturn slated for 1995, Sega began to develop a <a href="Improvisation">stop-gap</a> solution that would bridge the gap between the Genesis and the Saturn, and would serve as a less expensive entry into the <a href="History%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28fifth%20generation%29">32-bit era</a>. At the <a href="Consumer%20Electronics%20Show">Winter Consumer Electronics Show</a> in January 1994, Sega of America <a href="research%20and%20development">research and development</a> head Joe Miller took a phone call from Nakayama, in which Nakayama stressed the importance of coming up with a quick response to the <a href="Atari%20Jaguar">Atari Jaguar</a>. One potential idea for this came from a concept from Sega Enterprises, later known as "Project Jupiter," an entirely new independent console. Project Jupiter was initially slated to be a new version of the Genesis, with an upgraded color palette and a lower cost than the upcoming Saturn, as well as with some limited <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D</a> capabilities thanks to integration of ideas from the development of the Sega Virtua Processor chip. Miller suggested an alternative strategy, citing concerns with releasing a new console with no previous design specifications within six to nine months. At the suggestion from Miller and his team, Sega designed the 32X as a peripheral for the existing Genesis, expanding its power with two 32-bit <a href="SuperH">SuperH</a>-2 processors. The SH-2 had been developed in 1993 as a joint venture between Sega and Japanese electronics company <a href="Hitachi">Hitachi</a>. At the end of the Consumer Electronics show, with the basic design of the 32X in place, Sega Enterprises invited Sega of America to assist in development of the new add-on.

Although the new unit was a stronger console than originally proposed, it was not compatible with Saturn games. Before the 32X could be launched, the release date of the Saturn was announced for November 1994 in Japan, coinciding with the 32X's target launch date in North America. Sega of America now was faced with trying to market the 32X with the Saturn's Japan release occurring simultaneously. Their answer was to call the 32X a "transitional device" between the Genesis and the Saturn. This was justified by Sega's statement that both platforms would run at the same time, and that the 32X would be aimed at players who could not afford the more expensive Saturn.

The 32X was released in November 1994, in time for the holiday season. Demand among retailers was high, and Sega could not keep up orders for the system. More than 1,000,000 orders had been placed for 32X units, but Sega had only managed to ship 600,000 units by January 1995. Launching at about the same price as a Genesis console, the price of the 32X was less than half of what the Saturn's price would be at launch. Despite the console's positioning as an inexpensive entry into 32-bit gaming, Sega had a difficult time convincing third-party developers to create games for the new system. After an early run on the peripheral, news soon spread to the public of the upcoming release of the Sega Saturn, which would not support the 32X's games. The Saturn was released on May 11, 1995, four months earlier than its originally intended release date of September 2, 1995. The Saturn, in turn, caused developers to further shy away from the console and created doubt about <a href="List%20of%20Sega%2032X%20games">the library for the 32X</a>, even with Sega's assurances that there would be a large number of games developed for the system. In early 1996, Sega conceded that it had promised too much out of the 32X and decided to stop producing the system in order to focus on the Saturn. Prices for the 32X dropped to $99 and cleared out of stores at $19.95.

More than a dozen licensed variations of the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive have been released. In addition to models made by Sega, alternate models were made by other companies, such as <a href="Majesco%20Entertainment">Majesco Entertainment</a>, AtGames, <a href="JVC">JVC</a>, <a href="Pioneer%20Corporation">Pioneer Corporation</a>, <a href="Amstrad">Amstrad</a>, and <a href="Aiwa">Aiwa</a>. A number of <a href="Counterfeit%20consumer%20goods">bootleg</a> clones were created during its lifespan.

In 1993, Sega introduced a smaller, lighter version of the console, known as the Mega Drive 2 in Japan, Europe, and Australia and simply sold as Genesis (without the Sega prefix) in North America. This version omits the headphone jack in the front, replaces the A/V-Out connector with a smaller version that supports stereo sound, and provides a simpler, less expensive <a href="mainboard">mainboard</a> that requires less power.

Sega released a combined, semi-portable Genesis/Sega CD unit called the Genesis CDX (marketed as the Multi-Mega in Europe). This unit retailed at $399.95 in the U.S. (roughly $100 more than the individual Genesis and Sega CD units put together, since the Sega CD dropped its price to $229 half a year before), and was bundled with "<a href="Sonic%20CD">Sonic CD</a>", "<a href="Sega%20Classics%20Arcade%20Collection">Sega Classics Arcade Collection</a>", and the Sega CD version of "<a href="Ecco%20the%20Dolphin">Ecco the Dolphin</a>". The CDX features a small <a href="Liquid%20crystal%20display">LCD</a> screen that, when the unit is used to play audio CDs, displays the current track being played. With this feature and the system's lightweight build (weighing two pounds), Sega marketed it in part as a <a href="portable%20CD%20player">portable CD player</a>.

Late in the 16-bit era, Sega released a <a href="Handheld%20game%20console">handheld</a> version of the Genesis called the <a href="Genesis%20Nomad">Genesis Nomad</a>. Its design was based on the Mega Jet, a Mega Drive portable unit featured on airplane flights in Japan. As the only successor to the <a href="Game%20Gear">Game Gear</a>, the Nomad operates on 6 <a href="AA%20battery">AA batteries</a>, displaying its graphics on a 3.25-inch (8.25-mm) LCD screen. The Nomad supports the entire Genesis library, but cannot be used with the Sega 32X, the Sega CD, or the Power Base Converter.

Exclusive to the Japanese market was the <a href="Sega%20TeraDrive">TeraDrive</a>, a Mega Drive combined with an <a href="IBM%20PC%20compatible">IBM PC compatible</a> computer. Sega also produced three <a href="List%20of%20Sega%20arcade%20system%20boards">arcade system boards</a> based on the Mega Drive: the System C-2, the MegaTech, and the MegaPlay, which support approximately 80 games combined. 

Working with Sega Enterprises, JVC released the Wondermega on April 1, 1992, in Japan. The system was later redesigned by JVC and released as the X'Eye in North America in September 1994. Designed by JVC to be a Genesis and Sega CD combination with high quality audio, the Wondermega's high price ($500 at launch) kept it out of the hands of average consumers. The same was true of the <a href="Pioneer%20LaserActive">Pioneer LaserActive</a>, which requires an add-on known as the Mega-LD pack, developed by Sega, in order to play Genesis and Sega CD games. Although the LaserActive was lined up to compete with the <a href="3DO%20Interactive%20Multiplayer">3DO Interactive Multiplayer</a>, the combined price of the system and the Mega-LD pack made it a prohibitively expensive option for Sega players. Aiwa released the CSD-GM1, a combination Genesis/Sega CD unit built into a <a href="boombox">boombox</a>. Several companies added the Mega Drive to personal computers, mimicking the design of Sega's TeraDrive; these include the <a href="MSX">MSX</a> models AX-330 and AX-990, distributed in <a href="Kuwait">Kuwait</a> and <a href="Yemen">Yemen</a>, and the <a href="Amstrad%20Mega%20PC">Amstrad Mega PC</a>, distributed in Europe and Australia.

After the Genesis was discontinued, Majesco Entertainment released the Genesis 3 as a budget version in 1998. In 2009, AtGames began producing two new variations: the Firecore, which can play original Genesis cartridges as well as preloaded games, and a handheld console preloaded with 20 Genesis games. Companies such as <a href="Radica%20Games">Radica Games</a> have released various compilations of Genesis and Mega Drive games in "<a href="Handheld%20TV%20game">plug-and-play</a>" packages resembling the system's controller. 

A number of Genesis and Mega Drive <a href="Video%20game%20console%20emulator">emulator</a>s have been produced, including GenEM, KGen, Genecyst, VGen, St0rm, and Gens. The <a href="GameTap">GameTap</a> subscription gaming service included a Sega Genesis emulator and had several dozen licensed Genesis games in its catalog. The Console Classix subscription gaming service includes an emulator and has several hundred Sega Genesis games in its catalog.

Compilations of Sega Genesis games have been released for other consoles. These include "<a href="Sonic%20Mega%20Collection">Sonic Mega Collection</a>" and "<a href="Sonic%20Gems%20Collection">Sonic Gems Collection</a>" for <a href="PlayStation%202">PS2</a>, <a href="Xbox">Xbox</a>, and <a href="Nintendo%20GameCube">Nintendo GameCube</a>; "<a href="Sega%20Genesis%20Collection">Sega Genesis Collection</a>" for PS2 and <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PSP</a>, and "<a href="Sonic%27s%20Ultimate%20Genesis%20Collection">Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection</a>" (known as the "Sega Mega Drive Ultimate Collection" in PAL territories) for <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a>.

During his keynote speech at the 2006 <a href="Game%20Developers%20Conference">Game Developers Conference</a>, Nintendo president <a href="Satoru%20Iwata">Satoru Iwata</a> announced that Sega would make a number of Genesis/Mega Drive games available to download on the <a href="Wii">Wii</a>'s <a href="Virtual%20Console">Virtual Console</a>. There are select Sega Genesis games available on the Xbox 360 through <a href="Xbox%20Live%20Arcade">Xbox Live Arcade</a>, such as "Sonic the Hedgehog" and "Sonic 2", as well as games available via the <a href="PlayStation%20Network">PlayStation Network</a> and <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a>.

On May 22, 2006, North American company <a href="Super%20Fighter%20Team">Super Fighter Team</a> released "<a href="Beggar%20Prince">Beggar Prince</a>", a game translated from a 1996 <a href="China">Chinese</a> original. It was released worldwide and was the first commercial Genesis game release in North America since 1998. Super Fighter Team would later go on to release two more games for the system, "<a href="Legend%20of%20Wukong">Legend of Wukong</a>" and "<a href="Blue%20Almanac">Star Odyssey</a>". In December 2010, WaterMelon, an American company, released "<a href="Pier%20Solar%20and%20the%20Great%20Architects">Pier Solar and the Great Architects</a>", the first commercial <a href="role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing video game</a> specifically developed for the console since 1996, and the biggest 16-bit game ever produced at 64 <a href="megabit">Mb</a>. "Pier Solar" is the only cartridge-based game which can optionally use the Sega CD to play an enhanced soundtrack and sound effects disc. In 2013, independent programmer Future Driver, inspired by the Disney film "<a href="Wreck-It%20Ralph">Wreck-It Ralph</a>", developed "Fix-It Felix Jr." for the Genesis.

On December 5, 2007, Tec Toy released a portable version of the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive with twenty built-in games. Another version called "Mega Drive Guitar Idol" comes with two six-button joypads and a <a href="guitar%20controller">guitar controller</a> with five <a href="fret">fret</a> buttons. The "Guitar Idol" game contains a mix of Brazilian and international songs. The console has 87 built-in games, including some from Electronic Arts based on the <a href="Mobile%20game">mobile phone versions</a>.

In 2009, Chinese company AtGames produced a Sega Genesis/Mega Drive-compatible console, the Firecore. It features a top-loading cartridge slot and includes two controllers similar to the six-button controller for the original Genesis. The console has 15 games built-in and is region-free, allowing cartridge games to run regardless of their region. AtGames produced a handheld version of the console. Both machines have been released in Europe by distributing company <a href="Blaze%20Europe">Blaze Europe</a>.

It was announced that <a href="TecToy">TecToy</a> has developed a new Genesis console that not only looks almost identical to the original model of the Sega Genesis known as the Genesis III, but also has a traditional cartridge slot and <a href="SD%20card">SD card</a> reader which will be released in June 2017.

In 2018, Sega announced a miniature <a href="dedicated%20console">dedicated console</a> version of the Genesis, the Mega Drive Mini. Similar to the <a href="NES%20Classic%20Edition">NES</a> and <a href="SNES%20Classic%20Edition">SNES Classic Edition</a>s, it will allow users to play a number of built-in Genesis games.

The Sega Genesis has often ranked among the best video game consoles. In 2009, <a href="IGN">IGN</a> named it the fifth best video game console, citing its edge in sports games and better home version of "Mortal Kombat", and lauding "what some consider to be the greatest controller ever created: the six button." In 2007, <a href="GameTrailers">GameTrailers</a> named the Sega Genesis as the sixth best console of all time in their list of top ten consoles that "left their mark on the history of gaming," noting its great games and solid controller, and writing of the "glory days" of "Sonic the Hedgehog". In January 2008, technology columnist Don Reisinger proclaimed that the Sega Genesis "created the industry's best console war to date," citing Sonic the Hedgehog, superior sports games, and backward compatibility with the Sega Master System. GamingExcellence also gave the Sega Genesis sixth place in 2008, declaring, "one can truly see the Genesis for the gaming milestone it was." At the same time, <a href="GameDaily">GameDaily</a> rated it ninth of ten for its memorable games.

In 2014, USgamer's Jeremy Parish wrote, "If the Atari generation introduced video games as a short-lived '70s fad ... and the NES generation established it into an enduring obsession for the young, Sega's Genesis began pushing the medium toward something resembling its contemporary form," expounding that the system served as "the key incubator for modern sports franchises," made "consoles truly international" by providing Western third-parties previously put at a disadvantage by Nintendo's restrictive licensing policies with a more profitable alternative, created "an online subscription service" that foreshadowed "<a href="Playstation%20Plus">PlayStation Plus</a> more than 15 years early" with the Sega Channel, and "played a key role in ensuring the vitality and future of the games industry by breaking Nintendo's near-monopolistic hold on the U.S. and awakening the U.K. to the merits of television gaming."

For his part, Kalinske highlighted Sega's role in developing games for an older demographic and pioneering "the concept of the 'street date'" with the simultaneous North American and European release of "Sonic the Hedgehog 2". John Sczepaniak of "<a href="Retro%20Gamer">Retro Gamer</a>" noted, "It was a system where the allure was born not only of the hardware and games, but the magazines, playground arguments, climate, and politics of the time." Sega of America's marketing campaign for the Genesis was widely emulated, influencing marketing in the subsequent generation of consoles.

Problem of Apollonius

In <a href="Euclidean%20geometry">Euclidean plane geometry</a>, Apollonius's problem is to construct <a href="circle">circle</a>s that are <a href="tangent">tangent</a> to three given circles in a plane (Figure 1). <a href="Apollonius%20of%20Perga">Apollonius of Perga</a> (c. 262 190 BC) posed and solved this famous problem in his work ("", "Tangencies"); this work has been lost, but a 4th-century AD report of his results by <a href="Pappus%20of%20Alexandria">Pappus of Alexandria</a> has survived. Three given circles generically have eight different circles that are tangent to them (Figure 2), a pair of solutions for each way to divide the three given circles in two subsets (there are 4 ways to divide a set of cardinality 3 in 2 parts).

In the 16th century, <a href="Adriaan%20van%20Roomen">Adriaan van Roomen</a> solved the problem using intersecting <a href="hyperbola">hyperbola</a>s, but this solution does not use only <a href="straightedge%20and%20compass">straightedge and compass</a> constructions. <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Vi%C3%A8te">François Viète</a> found such a solution by exploiting <a href="limiting%20case%20%28mathematics%29">limiting case</a>s: any of the three given circles can be shrunk to zero <a href="radius">radius</a> (a <a href="point%20%28geometry%29">point</a>) or expanded to infinite radius (a <a href="line%20%28geometry%29">line</a>). Viète's approach, which uses simpler limiting cases to solve more complicated ones, is considered a plausible reconstruction of Apollonius' method. The method of van Roomen was simplified by <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a>, who showed that Apollonius' problem is equivalent to finding a position from the differences of its distances to three known points. This has applications in navigation and positioning systems such as <a href="LORAN">LORAN</a>.

Later mathematicians introduced <a href="algebra">algebraic methods</a>, which transform a geometric problem into <a href="algebraic%20equation">algebraic equation</a>s. These methods were simplified by exploiting <a href="Symmetry%20in%20mathematics">symmetries</a> inherent in the problem of Apollonius: for instance solution circles generically occur in pairs, with one solution enclosing the given circles that the other excludes (Figure 2). <a href="Joseph%20Diaz%20Gergonne">Joseph Diaz Gergonne</a> used this symmetry to provide an elegant straightedge and compass solution, while other mathematicians used <a href="transformation%20%28geometry%29">geometrical transformations</a> such as <a href="inversive%20geometry">reflection in a circle</a> to simplify the configuration of the given circles. These developments provide a geometrical setting for algebraic methods (using <a href="Lie%20sphere%20geometry">Lie sphere geometry</a>) and a classification of solutions according to 33 essentially different configurations of the given circles.

Apollonius' problem has stimulated much further work. Generalizations to three dimensions—constructing a <a href="sphere">sphere</a> tangent to four given spheres—and <a href="higher%20dimension">beyond</a> have been studied. The configuration of three mutually tangent circles has received particular attention. <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Descartes">René Descartes</a> gave a formula relating the radii of the solution circles and the given circles, now known as <a href="Descartes%27%20theorem">Descartes' theorem</a>. Solving Apollonius' problem iteratively in this case leads to the <a href="Apollonian%20gasket">Apollonian gasket</a>, which is one of the earliest <a href="fractal">fractal</a>s to be described in print, and is important in <a href="number%20theory">number theory</a> via <a href="Ford%20circles">Ford circles</a> and the <a href="Hardy%E2%80%93Littlewood%20circle%20method">Hardy–Littlewood circle method</a>.

The general statement of Apollonius' problem is to construct one or more circles that are tangent to three given objects in a plane, where an object may be a line, a point or a circle of any size. These objects may be arranged in any way and may cross one another; however, they are usually taken to be distinct, meaning that they do not coincide. Solutions to Apollonius' problem are sometimes called "Apollonius circles", although the term is also used for <a href="circles%20of%20Apollonius">other types of circles</a> associated with Apollonius.

The property of tangency is defined as follows. First, a point, line or circle is assumed to be tangent to itself; hence, if a given circle is already tangent to the other two given objects, it is counted as a solution to Apollonius' problem. Two distinct geometrical objects are said to "intersect" if they have a point in common. By definition, a point is tangent to a circle or a line if it intersects them, that is, if it lies on them; thus, two distinct points cannot be tangent. If the angle between lines or circles at an intersection point is zero, they are said to be "tangent"; the intersection point is called a "tangent point" or a "point of tangency". (The word "tangent" derives from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> <a href="participle">present participle</a>, "tangens", meaning "touching".) In practice, two distinct circles are tangent if they intersect at only one point; if they intersect at zero or two points, they are not tangent. The same holds true for a line and a circle. Two distinct lines cannot be tangent in the plane, although two <a href="parallel%20%28geometry%29">parallel</a> lines can be considered as tangent at a <a href="point%20at%20infinity">point at infinity</a> in <a href="inversive%20geometry">inversive geometry</a> (see <a href="%23Inversive%20methods">below</a>).

The solution circle may be either internally or externally tangent to each of the given circles. An "external" tangency is one where the two circles bend away from each other at their point of contact; they lie on opposite sides of the <a href="tangent%20lines%20to%20circles">tangent line</a> at that point, and they exclude one another. The distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii. By contrast, an "internal" tangency is one in which the two circles curve in the same way at their point of contact; the two circles lie on the same side of the tangent line, and one circle encloses the other. In this case, the distance between their centers equals the difference of their radii. As an illustration, in Figure 1, the pink solution circle is internally tangent to the medium-sized given black circle on the right, whereas it is externally tangent to the smallest and largest given circles on the left.

Apollonius' problem can also be formulated as the problem of locating one or more points such that the "differences" of its distances to three given points equal three known values. Consider a solution circle of radius "r" and three given circles of radii "r", "r" and "r". If the solution circle is externally tangent to all three given circles, the distances between the center of the solution circle and the centers of the given circles equal , and , respectively. Therefore, differences in these distances are constants, such as ; they depend only on the known radii of the given circles and not on the radius "r" of the solution circle, which cancels out. This second formulation of Apollonius' problem can be generalized to internally tangent solution circles (for which the center-center distance equals the difference of radii), by changing the corresponding differences of distances to sums of distances, so that the solution-circle radius "r" again cancels out. The re-formulation in terms of center-center distances is useful in the <a href="%23Intersecting%20hyperbolas">solutions below</a> of <a href="Adriaan%20van%20Roomen">Adriaan van Roomen</a> and <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a>, and also in <a href="hyperbolic%20positioning">hyperbolic positioning</a> or trilateration, which is the task of locating a position from differences in distances to three known points. For example, navigation systems such as <a href="LORAN">LORAN</a> identify a receiver's position from the differences in arrival times of signals from three fixed positions, which correspond to the differences in distances to those transmitters.

A rich repertoire of geometrical and algebraic methods have been developed to solve Apollonius' problem, which has been called "the most famous of all" geometry problems. The original approach of <a href="Apollonius%20of%20Perga">Apollonius of Perga</a> has been lost, but reconstructions have been offered by <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Vi%C3%A8te">François Viète</a> and others, based on the clues in the description by <a href="Pappus%20of%20Alexandria">Pappus of Alexandria</a>. The first new solution method was published in 1596 by <a href="Adriaan%20van%20Roomen">Adriaan van Roomen</a>, who identified the centers of the solution circles as the intersection points of two <a href="hyperbola">hyperbola</a>s. Van Roomen's method was refined in 1687 by <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a> in his "<a href="Philosophi%C3%A6%20Naturalis%20Principia%20Mathematica">Principia</a>", and by <a href="John%20Casey%20%28mathematician%29">John Casey</a> in 1881.

Although successful in solving Apollonius' problem, van Roomen's method has a drawback. A prized property in classical <a href="Euclidean%20geometry">Euclidean geometry</a> is the ability to solve problems using only a <a href="compass%20and%20straightedge%20construction">compass and a straightedge</a>. Many constructions are impossible using only these tools, such as <a href="angle%20trisection">dividing an angle in three equal parts</a>. However, many such "impossible" problems can be solved by intersecting curves such as hyperbolas, <a href="ellipse">ellipse</a>s and <a href="parabola">parabola</a>s (<a href="conic%20section">conic section</a>s). For example, <a href="doubling%20the%20cube">doubling the cube</a> (the problem of constructing a cube of twice the volume of a given cube) cannot be done using only a straightedge and compass, but <a href="Menaechmus">Menaechmus</a> showed that the problem can be solved by using the intersections of two <a href="parabola">parabola</a>s. Therefore, van Roomen's solution—which uses the intersection of two hyperbolas—did not determine if the problem satisfied the straightedge-and-compass property.

Van Roomen's friend <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Vi%C3%A8te">François Viète</a>, who had urged van Roomen to work on Apollonius' problem in the first place, developed a method that used only compass and straightedge. Prior to Viète's solution, <a href="Regiomontanus">Regiomontanus</a> doubted whether Apollonius' problem could be solved by straightedge and compass. Viète first solved some simple special cases of Apollonius' problem, such as finding a circle that passes through three given points which has only one solution if the points are distinct; he then built up to solving more complicated special cases, in some cases by shrinking or swelling the given circles. According to the 4th-century report of Pappus, Apollonius' own book on this problem—entitled ("", "Tangencies"; Latin: "De tactionibus", "De contactibus")—followed a similar progressive approach. Hence, Viète's solution is considered to be a plausible reconstruction of Apollonius' solution, although other reconstructions have been published independently by three different authors.

Several other geometrical solutions to Apollonius' problem were developed in the 19th century. The most notable solutions are those of <a href="Jean-Victor%20Poncelet">Jean-Victor Poncelet</a> (1811) and of <a href="Joseph%20Diaz%20Gergonne">Joseph Diaz Gergonne</a> (1814). Whereas Poncelet's proof relies on <a href="Antihomologous%20point">homothetic centers of circles</a> and the <a href="power%20of%20a%20point">power of a point</a> theorem, Gergonne's method exploits the conjugate relation between lines and their <a href="Pole%20%28geometry%29">poles</a> in a circle. Methods using <a href="inversive%20geometry">circle inversion</a> were pioneered by <a href="Julius%20Petersen">Julius Petersen</a> in 1879; one example is the annular solution method of <a href="Harold%20Scott%20MacDonald%20Coxeter">HSM Coxeter</a>. Another approach uses <a href="Lie%20sphere%20geometry">Lie sphere geometry</a>, which was developed by <a href="Sophus%20Lie">Sophus Lie</a>.

Algebraic solutions to Apollonius' problem were pioneered in the 17th century by <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Descartes">René Descartes</a> and <a href="Elisabeth%20of%20Bohemia%2C%20Princess%20Palatine">Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia</a>, although their solutions were rather complex. Practical algebraic methods were developed in the late 18th and 19th centuries by several mathematicians, including <a href="Leonhard%20Euler">Leonhard Euler</a>, <a href="Nicolas%20Fuss">Nicolas Fuss</a>, <a href="Carl%20Friedrich%20Gauss">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a>, <a href="Lazare%20Carnot">Lazare Carnot</a>, and <a href="Augustin%20Louis%20Cauchy">Augustin Louis Cauchy</a>.

The solution of <a href="Adriaan%20van%20Roomen">Adriaan van Roomen</a> (1596) is based on the intersection of two <a href="hyperbola">hyperbola</a>s. Let the given circles be denoted as "C", "C" and "C". Van Roomen solved the general problem by solving a simpler problem, that of finding the circles that are tangent to "two" given circles, such as "C" and "C". He noted that the center of a circle tangent to both given circles must lie on a <a href="hyperbola">hyperbola</a> whose foci are the centers of the given circles. To understand this, let the radii of the solution circle and the two given circles be denoted as "r", "r" and "r", respectively (Figure 3). The distance "d" between the centers of the solution circle and "C" is either or , depending on whether these circles are chosen to be externally or internally tangent, respectively. Similarly, the distance "d" between the centers of the solution circle and "C" is either or , again depending on their chosen tangency. Thus, the difference between these distances is always a constant that is independent of "r". This property, of having a fixed difference between the distances to the <a href="Focus%20%28geometry%29">foci</a>, characterizes hyperbolas, so the possible centers of the solution circle lie on a hyperbola. A second hyperbola can be drawn for the pair of given circles "C" and "C", where the internal or external tangency of the solution and "C" should be chosen consistently with that of the first hyperbola. An intersection of these two hyperbolas (if any) gives the center of a solution circle that has the chosen internal and external tangencies to the three given circles. The full set of solutions to Apollonius' problem can be found by considering all possible combinations of internal and external tangency of the solution circle to the three given circles.

<a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a> (1687) refined van Roomen's solution, so that the solution-circle centers were located at the intersections of a line with a circle. Newton formulates Apollonius' problem as a problem in <a href="trilateration">trilateration</a>: to locate a point Z from three given points A, B and C, such that the differences in distances from Z to the three given points have known values. These four points correspond to the center of the solution circle (Z) and the centers of the three given circles (A, B and C).

Instead of solving for the two hyperbolas, Newton constructs their <a href="conic%20section">directrix lines</a> instead. For any hyperbola, the ratio of distances from a point Z to a focus A and to the directrix is a fixed constant called the <a href="Eccentricity%20%28mathematics%29">eccentricity</a>. The two directrices intersect at a point T, and from their two known distance ratios, Newton constructs a line passing through T on which Z must lie. However, the ratio of distances TZ/TA is also known; hence, Z also lies on a known circle, since Apollonius had shown that a <a href="circle">circle</a> can be <a href="Circle%23Apollonius%20circle">defined</a> as the set of points that have a given ratio of distances to two fixed points. (As an aside, this definition is the basis of <a href="bipolar%20coordinates">bipolar coordinates</a>.) Thus, the solutions to Apollonius' problem are the intersections of a line with a circle.

As described <a href="%23Special%20cases">below</a>, Apollonius' problem has ten special cases, depending on the nature of the three given objects, which may be a circle (C), line (L) or point (P). By custom, these ten cases are distinguished by three letter codes such as CCP. Viète solved all ten of these cases using only compass and straightedge constructions, and used the solutions of simpler cases to solve the more complex cases.

Viète began by solving the PPP case (three points) following the method of <a href="Euclid">Euclid</a> in his "<a href="Euclid%27s%20Elements">Elements</a>". From this, he derived a <a href="Lemma%20%28mathematics%29">lemma</a> corresponding to the <a href="power%20of%20a%20point">power of a point</a> theorem, which he used to solve the LPP case (a line and two points). Following Euclid a second time, Viète solved the LLL case (three lines) using the <a href="angle%20bisector%20theorem">angle bisectors</a>. He then derived a lemma for constructing the line perpendicular to an angle bisector that passes through a point, which he used to solve the LLP problem (two lines and a point). This accounts for the first four cases of Apollonius' problem, those that do not involve circles.

To solve the remaining problems, Viète exploited the fact that the given circles and the solution circle may be re-sized in tandem while preserving their tangencies (Figure 4). If the solution-circle radius is changed by an amount Δ"r", the radius of its internally tangent given circles must be likewise changed by Δ"r", whereas the radius of its externally tangent given circles must be changed by −Δ"r". Thus, as the solution circle swells, the internally tangent given circles must swell in tandem, whereas the externally tangent given circles must shrink, to maintain their tangencies.

Viète used this approach to shrink one of the given circles to a point, thus reducing the problem to a simpler, already solved case. He first solved the CLL case (a circle and two lines) by shrinking the circle into a point, rendering it a LLP case. He then solved the CLP case (a circle, a line and a point) using three lemmas. Again shrinking one circle to a point, Viète transformed the CCL case into a CLP case. He then solved the CPP case (a circle and two points) and the CCP case (two circles and a point), the latter case by two lemmas. Finally, Viète solved the general CCC case (three circles) by shrinking one circle to a point, rendering it a CCP case.

Apollonius' problem can be framed as a system of three equations for the center and radius of the solution circle. Since the three given circles and any solution circle must lie in the same plane, their positions can be specified in terms of the ("x", "y") <a href="Cartesian%20coordinate%20system">coordinates</a> of their centers. For example, the center positions of the three given circles may be written as ("x", "y"), ("x", "y") and ("x", "y"), whereas that of a solution circle can be written as ("x", "y"). Similarly, the radii of the given circles and a solution circle can be written as "r", "r", "r" and "r", respectively. The requirement that a solution circle must exactly touch each of the three given circles can be expressed as three <a href="simultaneous%20equation">coupled</a> <a href="quadratic%20equation">quadratic equation</a>s for "x", "y" and "r":

The three numbers "s", "s" and "s" on the <a href="sides%20of%20an%20equation">right-hand side</a>, called signs, may equal ±1, and specify whether the desired solution circle should touch the corresponding given circle internally ("s" = 1) or externally ("s" = −1). For example, in Figures 1 and 4, the pink solution is internally tangent to the medium-sized given circle on the right and externally tangent to the smallest and largest given circles on the left; if the given circles are ordered by radius, the signs for this solution are . Since the three signs may be chosen independently, there are eight possible sets of equations , each set corresponding to one of the eight types of solution circles.

The general system of three equations may be solved by the method of <a href="resultant">resultant</a>s. When multiplied out, all three equations have on the left-hand side, and "r" on the right-hand side. Subtracting one equation from another eliminates these quadratic terms; the remaining linear terms may be re-arranged to yield formulae for the coordinates "x" and "y"

where "M", "N", "P" and "Q" are known functions of the given circles and the choice of signs. Substitution of these formulae into one of the initial three equations gives a quadratic equation for "r", which can be solved by the <a href="quadratic%20formula">quadratic formula</a>. Substitution of the numerical value of "r" into the linear formulae yields the corresponding values of "x" and "y".

The signs "s", "s" and "s" on the right-hand sides of the equations may be chosen in eight possible ways, and each choice of signs gives up to two solutions, since the equation for "r" is <a href="quadratic%20equation">quadratic</a>. This might suggest (incorrectly) that there are up to sixteen solutions of Apollonius' problem. However, due to a symmetry of the equations, if ("r", "x", "y") is a solution, with signs "s", then so is (−"r", "x", "y"), with opposite signs −"s", which represents the same solution circle. Therefore, Apollonius' problem has at most eight independent solutions (Figure 2). One way to avoid this double-counting is to consider only solution circles with non-negative radius.

The two roots of any quadratic equation may be of three possible types: two different <a href="real%20number">real number</a>s, two identical real numbers (i.e., a degenerate double root), or a pair of <a href="complex%20conjugate">complex conjugate</a> roots. The first case corresponds to the usual situation; each pair of roots corresponds to a pair of solutions that are related by <a href="Circle%20inversion%23Circle%20inversion">circle inversion</a>, as described below (Figure 6). In the second case, both roots are identical, corresponding to a solution circle that transforms into itself under inversion. In this case, one of the given circles is itself a solution to the Apollonius problem, and the number of distinct solutions is reduced by one. The third case of complex conjugate radii does not correspond to a geometrically possible solution for Apollonius' problem, since a solution circle cannot have an imaginary radius; therefore, the number of solutions is reduced by two. Apollonius' problem cannot have seven solutions, although it may have any other number of solutions from zero to eight.

The same algebraic equations can be derived in the context of <a href="Lie%20sphere%20geometry">Lie sphere geometry</a>. That geometry represents circles, lines and points in a unified way, as a five-dimensional vector "X" = ("v", "c", "c", "w", "sr"), where c = ("c", "c") is the center of the circle, and "r" is its (non-negative) radius. If "r" is not zero, the sign "s" may be positive or negative; for visualization, "s" represents the <a href="curve%20orientation">orientation</a> of the circle, with counterclockwise circles having a positive "s" and clockwise circles having a negative "s". The parameter "w" is zero for a straight line, and one otherwise.

In this five-dimensional world, there is a <a href="bilinear%20form">bilinear</a> product similar to the <a href="dot%20product">dot product</a>:

The <a href="Lie%20quadric">Lie quadric</a> is defined as those vectors whose product with themselves (their <a href="quadratic%20form">square norm</a>) is zero, ("X"|"X") = 0. Let "X" and "X" be two vectors belonging to this quadric; the norm of their difference equals

The product <a href="distributivity">distributes</a> over addition and subtraction (more precisely, it is <a href="bilinear%20form">bilinear</a>):

Since ("X"|"X") = ("X"|"X") = 0 (both belong to the Lie quadric) and since "w" = "w" = 1 for circles, the product of any two such vectors on the quadric equals

where the vertical bars sandwiching represent the length of that difference vector, i.e., the <a href="Euclidean%20norm">Euclidean norm</a>. This formula shows that if two quadric vectors "X" and "X" are orthogonal (perpendicular) to one another—that is, if ("X"|"X")=0—then their corresponding circles are tangent. For if the two signs "s" and "s" are the same (i.e. the circles have the same "orientation"), the circles are internally tangent; the distance between their centers equals the "difference" in the radii

Conversely, if the two signs "s" and "s" are different (i.e. the circles have opposite "orientations"), the circles are externally tangent; the distance between their centers equals the "sum" of the radii

Therefore, Apollonius' problem can be re-stated in Lie geometry as a problem of finding perpendicular vectors on the Lie quadric; specifically, the goal is to identify solution vectors "X" that belong to the Lie quadric and are also orthogonal (perpendicular) to the vectors "X", "X" and "X" corresponding to the given circles.

The advantage of this re-statement is that one can exploit theorems from <a href="linear%20algebra">linear algebra</a> on the maximum number of <a href="linearly%20independent">linearly independent</a>, simultaneously perpendicular vectors. This gives another way to calculate the maximum number of solutions and extend the theorem to higher-dimensional spaces.

A natural setting for problem of Apollonius is <a href="inversive%20geometry">inversive geometry</a>. The basic strategy of inversive methods is to transform a given Apollonius problem into another Apollonius problem that is simpler to solve; the solutions to the original problem are found from the solutions of the transformed problem by undoing the transformation. Candidate transformations must change one Apollonius problem into another; therefore, they must transform the given points, circles and lines to other points, circles and lines, and no other shapes. <a href="inversive%20geometry">Circle inversion</a> has this property and allows the center and radius of the inversion circle to be chosen judiciously. Other candidates include the <a href="Euclidean%20plane%20isometry">Euclidean plane isometries</a>; however, they do not simplify the problem, since they merely <a href="Translation%20%28mathematics%29">shift</a>, <a href="Coordinate%20rotation">rotate</a>, and <a href="Reflection%20%28mathematics%29">mirror</a> the original problem.

Inversion in a circle with center O and radius "R" consists of the following operation (Figure 5): every point P is mapped into a new point P' such that O, P, and P' are collinear, and the product of the distances of P and P' to the center O equal the radius "R" squared

Thus, if P lies outside the circle, then P' lies within, and vice versa. When P is the same as O, the inversion is said to send P to infinity. (In <a href="complex%20analysis">complex analysis</a>, "infinity" is defined in terms of the <a href="Riemann%20sphere">Riemann sphere</a>.) Inversion has the useful property that lines and circles are always transformed into lines and circles, and points are always transformed into points. Circles are generally transformed into other circles under inversion; however, if a circle passes through the center of the inversion circle, it is transformed into a straight line, and vice versa. Importantly, if a circle crosses the circle of inversion at right angles (intersects perpendicularly), it is left unchanged by the inversion; it is transformed into itself.

Circle inversions correspond to a subset of <a href="M%C3%B6bius%20transformation">Möbius transformation</a>s on the <a href="Riemann%20sphere">Riemann sphere</a>. The planar Apollonius problem can be transferred to the sphere by an <a href="stereographic%20projection">inverse stereographic projection</a>; hence, solutions of the planar Apollonius problem also pertain to its counterpart on the sphere. Other inversive solutions to the planar problem are possible besides the common ones described below.

Solutions to Apollonius' problem generally occur in pairs; for each solution circle, there is a conjugate solution circle (Figure 6). One solution circle excludes the given circles that are enclosed by its conjugate solution, and vice versa. For example, in Figure 6, one solution circle (pink, upper left) encloses two given circles (black), but excludes a third; conversely, its conjugate solution (also pink, lower right) encloses that third given circle, but excludes the other two. The two conjugate solution circles are related by <a href="inversive%20geometry">inversion</a>, by the following argument.

In general, any three distinct circles have a unique circle—the <a href="Power%20center%20%28geometry%29">radical circle</a>—that intersects all of them perpendicularly; the center of that circle is the <a href="power%20center%20%28geometry%29">radical center</a> of the three circles. For illustration, the orange circle in Figure 6 crosses the black given circles at right angles. <a href="inversive%20geometry">Inversion</a> in the radical circle leaves the given circles unchanged, but transforms the two conjugate pink solution circles into one another. Under the same inversion, the corresponding points of tangency of the two solution circles are transformed into one another; for illustration, in Figure 6, the two blue points lying on each green line are transformed into one another. Hence, the lines connecting these conjugate tangent points are invariant under the inversion; therefore, they must pass through the center of inversion, which is the radical center (green lines intersecting at the orange dot in Figure 6).

If two of the three given circles do not intersect, a center of inversion can be chosen so that those two given circles become <a href="concentric">concentric</a>. Under this inversion, the solution circles must fall within the <a href="Annulus%20%28mathematics%29">annulus</a> between the two concentric circles. Therefore, they belong to two one-parameter families. In the first family (Figure 7), the solutions do "not" enclose the inner concentric circle, but rather revolve like ball bearings in the annulus. In the second family (Figure 8), the solution circles enclose the inner concentric circle. There are generally four solutions for each family, yielding eight possible solutions, consistent with the <a href="%23Algebraic%20solutions">algebraic solution</a>.

When two of the given circles are concentric, Apollonius' problem can be solved easily using a method of <a href="Carl%20Friedrich%20Gauss">Gauss</a>. The radii of the three given circles are known, as is the distance "d" from the common concentric center to the non-concentric circle (Figure 7). The solution circle can be determined from its radius "r", the angle θ, and the distances "d" and "d" from its center to the common concentric center and the center of the non-concentric circle, respectively. The radius and distance "d" are known (Figure 7), and the distance "d" = "r" ± "r", depending on whether the solution circle is internally or externally tangent to the non-concentric circle. Therefore, by the <a href="law%20of%20cosines">law of cosines</a>,

Here, a new constant "C" has been defined for brevity, with the subscript indicating whether the solution is externally or internally tangent. A simple trigonometric rearrangement yields the four solutions

This formula represents four solutions, corresponding to the two choices of the sign of θ, and the two choices for "C". The remaining four solutions can be obtained by the same method, using the substitutions for "r" and "d" indicated in Figure 8. Thus, all eight solutions of the general Apollonius problem can be found by this method.

Any initial two disjoint given circles can be rendered concentric as follows. The <a href="radical%20axis">radical axis</a> of the two given circles is constructed; choosing two arbitrary points P and Q on this radical axis, two circles can be constructed that are centered on P and Q and that intersect the two given circles orthogonally. These two constructed circles intersect each other in two points. Inversion in one such intersection point F renders the constructed circles into straight lines emanating from F and the two given circles into concentric circles, with the third given circle becoming another circle (in general). This follows because the system of circles is equivalent to a set of <a href="Apollonian%20circles">Apollonian circles</a>, forming a <a href="bipolar%20coordinate%20system">bipolar coordinate system</a>.

The usefulness of <a href="Inversive%20geometry">inversion</a> can be increased significantly by resizing. As noted in <a href="%23Vi%C3%A8te%27s%20reconstruction">Viète's reconstruction</a>, the three given circles and the solution circle can be resized in tandem while preserving their tangencies. Thus, the initial Apollonius problem is transformed into another problem that may be easier to solve. For example, the four circles can be resized so that one given circle is shrunk to a point; alternatively, two given circles can often be resized so that they are tangent to one another. Thirdly, given circles that intersect can be resized so that they become non-intersecting, after which the <a href="%23Inversion%20to%20an%20annulus">method for inverting to an annulus</a> can be applied. In all such cases, the solution of the original Apollonius problem is obtained from the solution of the transformed problem by undoing the resizing and inversion.

In the first approach, the given circles are shrunk or swelled (appropriately to their tangency) until one given circle is shrunk to a point P. In that case, Apollonius' problem degenerates to the CCP , which is the problem of finding a solution circle tangent to the two remaining given circles that passes through the point P. Inversion in a circle centered on P transforms the two given circles into new circles, and the solution circle into a line. Therefore, the transformed solution is a line that is tangent to the two transformed given circles. There are four such solution lines, which may be constructed from the external and internal <a href="homothetic%20center">homothetic center</a>s of the two circles. Re-inversion in P and undoing the resizing transforms such a solution line into the desired solution circle of the original Apollonius problem. All eight general solutions can be obtained by shrinking and swelling the circles according to the differing internal and external tangencies of each solution; however, different given circles may be shrunk to a point for different solutions.

In the second approach, the radii of the given circles are modified appropriately by an amount Δ"r" so that two of them are tangential (touching). Their point of tangency is chosen as the center of <a href="inversion%20in%20a%20circle">inversion in a circle</a> that intersects each of the two touching circles in two places. Upon inversion, the touching circles become two parallel lines: Their only point of intersection is sent to infinity under inversion, so they cannot meet. The same inversion transforms the third circle into another circle. The solution of the inverted problem must either be (1) a straight line parallel to the two given parallel lines and tangent to the transformed third given circle; or (2) a circle of constant radius that is tangent to the two given parallel lines and the transformed given circle. Re-inversion and adjusting the radii of all circles by Δ"r" produces a solution circle tangent to the original three circles.

Gergonne's approach is to consider the solution circles in pairs. Let a pair of solution circles be denoted as "C" and "C" (the pink circles in Figure 6), and let their tangent points with the three given circles be denoted as A, A, A, and B, B, B, respectively. Gergonne's solution aims to locate these six points, and thus solve for the two solution circles.

Gergonne's insight was that if a line "L" could be constructed such that A and B were guaranteed to fall on it, those two points could be identified as the intersection points of "L" with the given circle "C" (Figure 6). The remaining four tangent points would be located similarly, by finding lines "L" and "L" that contained A and B, and A and B, respectively. To construct a line such as "L", two points must be identified that lie on it; but these points need not be the tangent points. Gergonne was able to identify two other points for each of the three lines. One of the two points has already been identified: the <a href="power%20center%20%28geometry%29">radical center</a> G lies on all three lines (Figure 6).

To locate a second point on the lines "L", "L" and "L", Gergonne noted a <a href="reciprocation%20%28geometry%29">reciprocal relationship</a> between those lines and the <a href="radical%20axis">radical axis</a> "R" of the solution circles, "C" and "C". To understand this reciprocal relationship, consider the two tangent lines to the circle "C" drawn at its tangent points A and B with the solution circles; the intersection of these tangent lines is the <a href="pole%20%28geometry%29">pole</a> point of "L" in "C". Since the distances from that pole point to the tangent points A and B are equal, this pole point must also lie on the radical axis "R" of the solution circles, by definition (Figure 9). The relationship between pole points and their polar lines is reciprocal; if the pole of "L" in "C" lies on "R", the pole of "R" in "C" must conversely lie on "L". Thus, if we can construct "R", we can find its pole P in "C", giving the needed second point on "L" (Figure 10).

Gergonne found the radical axis "R" of the unknown solution circles as follows. Any pair of circles has two <a href="homothetic%20center">centers of similarity</a>; these two points are the two possible intersections of two tangent lines to the two circles. Therefore, the three given circles have six centers of similarity, two for each distinct pair of given circles. Remarkably, these six points lie on four lines, three points on each line; moreover, each line corresponds to the <a href="radical%20axis">radical axis</a> of a potential pair of solution circles. To show this, Gergonne considered lines through corresponding points of tangency on two of the given circles, e.g., the line defined by A/A and the line defined by B/B. Let X be a center of similitude for the two circles "C" and "C"; then, A/A and B/B <a href="Homothetic%20center%23Tangent%20circles%20and%20antihomologous%20points">are pairs of antihomologous points</a>, and their lines intersect at X. It follows, therefore, that the products of distances are equal

which implies that X lies on the radical axis of the two solution circles. The same argument can be applied to the other pairs of circles, so that three centers of similitude for the given three circles must lie on the radical axes of pairs of solution circles.

In summary, the desired line "L" is defined by two points: the radical center G of the three given circles and the pole in "C" of one of the four lines connecting the homothetic centers. Finding the same pole in "C" and "C" gives "L" and "L", respectively; thus, all six points can be located, from which one pair of solution circles can be found. Repeating this procedure for the remaining three homothetic-center lines yields six more solutions, giving eight solutions in all. However, if a line "L" does not intersect its circle "C" for some "k", there is no pair of solutions for that homothetic-center line.

The techniques of modern <a href="algebraic%20geometry">algebraic geometry</a>, and in particular <a href="intersection%20theory">intersection theory</a>, can be used to solve Apollonius's problem. In this approach, the problem is reinterpreted as a statement about circles in the <a href="complex%20projective%20plane">complex projective plane</a>. Solutions involving complex numbers are allowed and degenerate situations are counted with multiplicity. When this is done, there are always eight solutions to the problem.

Every quadratic equation in , , and determines a unique conic, its vanishing locus. Conversely, every conic in the complex projective plane has an equation, and that equation is unique up to an overall scaling factor (because rescaling an equation does not change its vanishing locus). Therefore, the set of all conics may be parametrized by five-dimensional projective space , where the correspondence is
A "circle" in the complex projective plane is defined to be a conic that passes through the two points and , where denotes a square root of . The points and are called the "circular points". The <a href="projective%20variety">projective variety</a> of all circles is the subvariety of consisting of those points which correspond to conics passing through the circular points. Substituting the circular points into the equation for a generic conic yields the two equations
Taking the sum and difference of these equations shows that it is equivalent to impose the conditions
Therefore, the variety of all circles is a three-dimensional linear subspace of . After rescaling and <a href="completing%20the%20square">completing the square</a>, these equations also demonstrate that every conic passing through the circular points has an equation of the form
which is the homogenization of the usual equation of a circle in the affine plane. Therefore, studying circles in the above sense is nearly equivalent to studying circles in the conventional sense. The only difference is that the above sense permits degenerate circles which are the union of two lines. The non-degenerate circles are called "smooth circles", while the degenerate ones are called "<a href="singular%20point%20of%20a%20curve">singular</a> circles." There are two types of singular circles. One is the union of the line at infinity with another line in the projective plane (possibly the line at infinity again), and the other is union of two lines in the projective plane, one through each of the two circular points. These are the limits of smooth circles as the radius tends to and , respectively. In the latter case, no point on either of the two lines has real coordinates except for the origin .

Let be a fixed smooth circle. If is any other circle, then, by the definition of a circle, and intersect at the circular points and . Because and are conics, <a href="B%C3%A9zout%27s%20theorem">Bézout's theorem</a> implies and intersect in four points total, when those points are counted with the proper <a href="intersection%20multiplicity">intersection multiplicity</a>. That is, there are four points of intersection , , , and , but some of these points might collide. Appolonius' problem is concerned with the situation where , meaning that the intersection multiplicity at that point is ; if is also equal to a circular point, this should be interpreted as the intersection multiplicity being .

Let be the variety of circles tangent to . This variety is a quadric cone in the of all circles. To see this, consider the <a href="incidence%20correspondence">incidence correspondence</a>
For a curve that is the vanishing locus of a single equation , the condition that the curve meets at with multiplicity means that the <a href="Taylor%20series">Taylor series</a> expansion of vanishes to order at ; it is therefore linear conditions on the coefficients of . This shows that, for each , the fiber of over is a cut out by two linear equations in the space of circles. Consequently, is irreducible of dimension . Since it is possible to exhibit a circle that is tangent to at only a single point, a generic element of must be tangent at only a single point. Therefore, the projection sending to is a <a href="birational%20morphism">birational morphism</a>. It follows that the image of , which is , is also irreducible and two dimensional.

To determine the shape of , fix two distinct circles and , not necessarily tangent to . These two circles determine a <a href="pencil%20%28mathematics%29">pencil</a>, meaning a line in the of circles. If the equations of and are and , respectively, then the points on correspond to the circles whose equations are , where is a point of . The points where meets are precisely the circles in the pencil that are tangent to .

There are two possibilities for the number of points of intersections. One is that either or , say , is the equation for . In this case, is a line through . If is tangent to , then so is every circle in the pencil, and therefore is contained in . The other possibility is that neither nor is the equation for . In this case, the function is a quotient of quadratics, neither of which vanishes identically. Therefore, it vanishes at two points and has <a href="pole%20and%20polar">poles</a> at two points. These are the points in and , respectively, counted with multiplicity and with the circular points deducted. The rational function determines a morphism of degree two. The fiber over is the set of points for which . These are precisely the points at which the circle whose equation is meets . The <a href="branch%20point">branch point</a>s of this morphism are the circles tangent to . By the <a href="Riemann%E2%80%93Hurwitz%20formula">Riemann–Hurwitz formula</a>, there are precisely two branch points, and therefore meets in two points. Together, these two possibilities for the intersection of and demonstrate that is a quadric cone. All such cones in are the same up to a change of coordinates, so this completely determines the shape of .

To conclude the argument, let , , and be three circles. If the intersection is finite, then it has degree , and therefore there are eight solutions to the problem of Apollonius, counted with multiplicity. To prove that the intersection is generically finite, consider the incidence correspondence
There is a morphism which projects onto its final factor of . The fiber over is . This has dimension , so has dimension . Because also has dimension , the generic fiber of the projection from to the first three factors cannot have positive dimension. This proves that generically, there are eight solutions counted with multiplicity. Since it is possible to exhibit a configuration where the eight solutions are distinct, the generic configuration must have all eight solutions distinct.

In the generic problem with eight solution circles, The reciprocals of the radii of four of the solution circles sum to the same value as do the reciprocals of the radii of the other four solution circles.

Apollonius problem is to construct one or more circles tangent to three given objects in a plane, which may be circles, points, or lines. This gives rise to ten types of Apollonius' problem, one corresponding to each combination of circles, lines and points, which may be labeled with three letters, either C, L, or P, to denote whether the given elements are a circle, line or point, respectively (<a href="%23Apollonius%20problem%20types">Table 1</a>). As an example, the type of Apollonius problem with a given circle, line, and point is denoted as CLP.

Some of these <a href="special%20case">special case</a>s are much easier to solve than the general case of three given circles. The two simplest cases are the problems of drawing a circle through three given points (PPP) or tangent to three lines (LLL), which were solved first by <a href="Euclid">Euclid</a> in his "<a href="Euclid%27s%20Elements">Elements</a>". For example, the PPP problem can be solved as follows. The center of the solution circle is equally distant from all three points, and therefore must lie on the <a href="perpendicular%20bisector">perpendicular bisector</a> line of any two. Hence, the center is the point of intersection of any two perpendicular bisectors. Similarly, in the LLL case, the center must lie on a line bisecting the angle at the three intersection points between the three given lines; hence, the center lies at the intersection point of two such angle bisectors. Since there are two such bisectors at every intersection point of the three given lines, there are four solutions to the general LLL problem.

Points and lines may be viewed as special cases of circles; a point can be considered as a circle of infinitely small radius, and a line may be thought of an infinitely large circle whose center is also at infinity. From this perspective, the general Apollonius problem is that of constructing circles tangent to three given circles. The nine other cases involving points and lines may be viewed as <a href="limiting%20case%20%28mathematics%29">limiting case</a>s of the general problem. These limiting cases often have fewer solutions than the general problem; for example, the replacement of a given circle by a given point halves the number of solutions, since a point can be construed as an infinitesimal circle that is either internally or externally tangent.

The problem of counting the number of solutions to different types of Apollonius' problem belongs to the field of <a href="enumerative%20geometry">enumerative geometry</a>. The general number of solutions for each of the ten types of Apollonius' problem is given in Table 1 above. However, special arrangements of the given elements may change the number of solutions. For illustration, Apollonius' problem has no solution if one circle separates the two (Figure 11); to touch both the solid given circles, the solution circle would have to cross the dashed given circle; but that it cannot do, if it is to touch the dashed circle tangentially. Conversely, if three given circles are all tangent at the same point, then "any" circle tangent at the same point is a solution; such Apollonius problems have an infinite number of solutions. If any of the given circles are identical, there is likewise an infinity of solutions. If only two given circles are identical, there are only two distinct given circles; the centers of the solution circles form a <a href="hyperbola">hyperbola</a>, as used in <a href="%23Intersecting%20hyperbolas">one solution</a> to Apollonius' problem.

An exhaustive enumeration of the number of solutions for all possible configurations of three given circles, points or lines was first undertaken by Muirhead in 1896, although earlier work had been done by Stoll and Study. However, Muirhead's work was incomplete; it was extended in 1974 and a definitive enumeration, with 33 distinct cases, was published in 1983. Although solutions to Apollonius' problem generally occur in pairs related by <a href="%23Pairs%20of%20solutions%20by%20inversion">inversion</a>, an odd number of solutions is possible in some cases, e.g., the single solution for PPP, or when one or three of the given circles are themselves solutions. (An example of the latter is given in the on <a href="Descartes%27%20theorem">Descartes' theorem</a>.) However, there are no Apollonius problems with seven solutions. Alternative solutions based on the <a href="Lie%20sphere%20geometry">geometry of circles and spheres</a> have been developed and used in higher dimensions.

If the three given circles are mutually tangent, Apollonius' problem has five solutions. Three solutions are the given circles themselves, since each is tangent to itself and to the other two given circles. The remaining two solutions (shown in red in Figure 12) correspond to the <a href="incircle%20and%20excircles%20of%20a%20triangle">inscribed</a> and <a href="circumscribed%20circle">circumscribed circle</a>s, and are called "Soddy's circles". This special case of Apollonius' problem is also known as the four coins problem. The three given circles of this Apollonius problem form a <a href="Steiner%20chain">Steiner chain</a> tangent to the two Soddy's circles.

Either Soddy circle, when taken together with the three given circles, produces a set of four circles that are mutually tangent at six points. The radii of these four circles are related by an equation known as <a href="Descartes%27%20theorem">Descartes' theorem</a>. In a 1643 letter to Princess <a href="Elizabeth%20of%20Bohemia">Elizabeth of Bohemia</a>, <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Descartes">René Descartes</a> showed that

where "k" = 1/"r" and "r" are the <a href="curvature">curvature</a> and radius of the solution circle, respectively, and similarly for the curvatures "k", "k" and "k" and radii "r", "r" and "r" of the three given circles. For every set of four mutually tangent circles, there is a second set of four mutually tangent circles that are tangent at the same six points.

Descartes' theorem was rediscovered independently in 1826 by <a href="Jakob%20Steiner">Jakob Steiner</a>, in 1842 by Philip Beecroft, and again in 1936 by <a href="Frederick%20Soddy">Frederick Soddy</a>. Soddy published his findings in the scientific journal "<a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">Nature</a>" as a poem, "The Kiss Precise", of which the first two stanzas are reproduced below. The first stanza describes Soddy's circles, whereas the second stanza gives Descartes' theorem. In Soddy's poem, two circles are said to "kiss" if they are tangent, whereas the term "bend" refers to the curvature "k" of the circle.

Sundry extensions of Descartes' theorem have been derived by <a href="Daniel%20Pedoe">Daniel Pedoe</a>.

Apollonius' problem can be extended to construct all the circles that intersect three given circles at a precise angle θ, or at three specified crossing angles θ, θ and θ; the ordinary Apollonius' problem corresponds to a special case in which the crossing angle is zero for all three given circles. Another generalization is the <a href="duality%20%28mathematics%29">dual</a> of the first extension, namely, to construct circles with three specified tangential distances from the three given circles.

Apollonius' problem can be extended from the plane to the <a href="sphere">sphere</a> and other <a href="quadric%20surface">quadratic surfaces</a>. For the sphere, the problem is to construct all the circles (the boundaries of <a href="spherical%20cap">spherical cap</a>s) that are tangent to three given circles on the sphere. This spherical problem can be rendered into a corresponding planar problem using <a href="stereographic%20projection">stereographic projection</a>. Once the solutions to the planar problem have been constructed, the corresponding solutions to the spherical problem can be determined by inverting the stereographic projection. Even more generally, one can consider the problem of four tangent curves that result from the intersections of an arbitrary quadratic surface and four planes, a problem first considered by <a href="Charles%20Dupin">Charles Dupin</a>.

By solving Apollonius' problem repeatedly to find the inscribed circle, the interstices between mutually tangential circles can be filled arbitrarily finely, forming an <a href="Apollonian%20gasket">Apollonian gasket</a>, also known as a "Leibniz packing" or an "Apollonian packing". This gasket is a <a href="fractal">fractal</a>, being self-similar and having a <a href="Hausdorff%20dimension">dimension</a> "d" that is not known exactly but is roughly 1.3, which is higher than that of a <a href="regular%20curve">regular</a> (or <a href="rectifiable%20curve">rectifiable</a>) curve ("d" = 1) but less than that of a plane ("d" = 2). The Apollonian gasket was first described by <a href="Gottfried%20Leibniz">Gottfried Leibniz</a> in the 17th century, and is a curved precursor of the 20th-century <a href="Sierpi%C5%84ski%20triangle">Sierpiński triangle</a>. The Apollonian gasket also has deep connections to other fields of mathematics; for example, it is the limit set of <a href="Kleinian%20group">Kleinian group</a>s.

The configuration of a circle tangent to "four" circles in the plane has special properties, which have been elucidated by Larmor (1891) and Lachlan (1893). Such a configuration is also the basis for <a href="Casey%27s%20theorem">Casey's theorem</a>, itself a generalization of <a href="Ptolemy%27s%20theorem">Ptolemy's theorem</a>.

The extension of Apollonius' problem to three dimensions, namely, the problem of finding a fifth sphere that is tangent to four given spheres, can be solved by analogous methods. For example, the given and solution spheres can be resized so that one given sphere is shrunk to point while maintaining tangency. Inversion in this point reduces Apollonius' problem to finding a plane that is tangent to three given spheres. There are in general eight such planes, which become the solutions to the original problem by reversing the inversion and the resizing. This problem was first considered by <a href="Pierre%20de%20Fermat">Pierre de Fermat</a>, and many alternative solution methods have been developed over the centuries.

Apollonius' problem can even be extended to "d" dimensions, to construct the <a href="hypersphere">hypersphere</a>s tangent to a given set of hyperspheres. Following the publication of <a href="Frederick%20Soddy">Frederick Soddy</a>'s re-derivation of the <a href="Descartes%20theorem">Descartes theorem</a> in 1936, several people solved (independently) the mutually tangent case corresponding to Soddy's circles in "d" dimensions.

The principal application of Apollonius' problem, as formulated by Isaac Newton, is <a href="hyperbolic%20positioning">hyperbolic trilateration</a>, which seeks to determine a position from the "differences" in distances to at least three points. For example, a ship may seek to determine its position from the differences in arrival times of signals from three synchronized transmitters. Solutions to Apollonius' problem were used in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> to determine the location of an artillery piece from the time a gunshot was heard at three different positions, and hyperbolic trilateration is the principle used by the <a href="Decca%20Navigator%20System">Decca Navigator System</a> and <a href="LORAN">LORAN</a>. Similarly, the location of an aircraft may be determined from the difference in arrival times of its <a href="transponder%20%28aviation%29">transponder</a> signal at four receiving stations. This <a href="multilateration">multilateration</a> problem is equivalent to the three-dimensional generalization of Apollonius' problem and applies to <a href="global%20navigation%20satellite%20systems">global navigation satellite systems</a> (see <a href="GPS%23Geometric%20interpretation">GPS#Geometric interpretation</a>). It is also used to determine the position of calling animals (such as birds and whales), although Apollonius' problem does not pertain if the <a href="speed%20of%20sound">speed of sound</a> varies with direction (i.e., the <a href="transmission%20medium">transmission medium</a> not <a href="isotropic">isotropic</a>).

Apollonius' problem has other applications. In Book 1, Proposition 21 in his "<a href="Philosophi%C3%A6%20Naturalis%20Principia%20Mathematica">Principia</a>", <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a> used his solution of Apollonius' problem to construct an orbit in <a href="celestial%20mechanics">celestial mechanics</a> from the center of attraction and observations of tangent lines to the orbit corresponding to instantaneous <a href="velocity">velocity</a>. The special case of the problem of Apollonius when all three circles are tangent is used in the <a href="Hardy%E2%80%93Littlewood%20circle%20method">Hardy–Littlewood circle method</a> of <a href="analytic%20number%20theory">analytic number theory</a> to construct <a href="Hans%20Rademacher">Hans Rademacher</a>'s contour for complex integration, given by the boundaries of an <a href="infinite%20set">infinite set</a> of <a href="Ford%20circle">Ford circle</a>s each of which touches several others. Finally, Apollonius' problem has been applied to some types of <a href="packing%20problem">packing problem</a>s, which arise in disparate fields such as the <a href="error-correcting%20code">error-correcting code</a>s used on <a href="DVD">DVD</a>s and the design of pharmaceuticals that bind in a particular <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a> of a pathogenic <a href="bacteria">bacterium</a>.

1962 Tour de France

The 1962 Tour de France was the 49th edition of the <a href="Tour%20de%20France">Tour de France</a>, one of cycling's <a href="Grand%20Tour%20%28cycling%29">Grand Tours</a>. The race consisted of 22 <a href="race%20stage">stages</a>, including two split stages, starting in <a href="Nancy%2C%20France">Nancy</a> on 24 June and finishing at the <a href="Parc%20des%20Princes">Parc des Princes</a> in Paris on 15 July. There were four <a href="time%20trial">time trial</a> stages and no rest days. After more than 30 years, the Tour was again contested by trade teams instead of national teams. <a href="Jacques%20Anquetil">Jacques Anquetil</a> of the team won the overall <a href="General%20classification%20in%20the%20Tour%20de%20France">general classification</a>, defending his title to win his third Tour de France. <a href="Jef%20Planckaert">Jef Planckaert</a> () placed second, 4 min and 59 s in arrears, and <a href="Raymond%20Poulidor">Raymond Poulidor</a> () was third, over ten minutes behind Anquetil.

Anquetil's teammate <a href="Rudi%20Altig">Rudi Altig</a> took the first general classification leader's yellow jersey after winning the first stage. He lost it the following day to <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Darrigade">André Darrigade</a> of , who won stage 2a, before regaining it after winning stage three. The lead was taken by Saint-Raphaël rider <a href="Albertus%20Geldermans">Albertus Geldermans</a> after stage six. He held it for two stages, before Darrigade took it back for the next two. Flandria rider <a href="Willy%20Schroeders">Willy Schroeders</a> then led the race between the end of stage nine to the end of eleven, at which point Schroeder's teammate <a href="Rik%20Van%20Looy">Rik Van Looy</a>, a major pre-race favourite, abandoned the race with an injury. The following day, British rider <a href="Tom%20Simpson">Tom Simpson</a> (Gitane–Leroux) became the first rider from outside <a href="Continental%20Europe">mainland Europe</a> in history to wear the yellow jersey. He lost it to Planckaert after stage thirteen's <a href="individual%20time%20trial">individual time trial</a> to <a href="Superbagn%C3%A8res">Superbagnères</a> in the <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a>. He held the lead for seven stages, which included the <a href="Alps">Alps</a>. Anquetil's victory in the individual time trial of stage twenty put him in the yellow jersey, which he held until the conclusion of the race.

In the other race classifications, Altig won the <a href="Points%20classification%20in%20the%20Tour%20de%20France">points classification</a> and <a href="Federico%20Bahamontes">Federico Bahamontes</a> () won the <a href="Mountains%20classification%20in%20the%20Tour%20de%20France">mountains classification</a>. The <a href="Team%20classification%20in%20the%20Tour%20de%20France">team classification</a> was won by Saint-Raphaël, and <a href="Eddy%20Pauwels">Eddy Pauwels</a> () won the award for most <a href="Combativity%20award%20in%20the%20Tour%20de%20France">combative</a> rider. Altig and <a href="Emile%20Daems">Emile Daems</a> () won the most stages, with three each.

From <a href="1930%20Tour%20de%20France">1930</a> to <a href="1961%20Tour%20de%20France">1961</a>, the Tour de France was contested by national <a href="Cycling%20team">teams</a>, but in 1962 commercially sponsored international trade teams returned. From the late-1950s to 1962, the Tour had seen the absence of top riders who had bowed to pressure from their team's "extra-sportif" (non-cycling industry) sponsors to ride other races that better suited their brands. This, and a demand for wider advertising from a declining <a href="bicycle%20industry">bicycle industry</a>, led to the reintroduction of the trade team format.

In early February 1962, 22 teams submitted applications for the race, with the final list of 15 announced at the end of the month. The Spanish-based was the first choice reserve team. Each of the 15 teams consisted of 10 cyclists (150 total), an increase from the 1961 Tour, which had 11 teams of 12 cyclists (132 total). Each team was required to have a dominant nationality; at least six cyclists should have the same nationality, or only two nationalities should be present. For the first time, the French cyclists were outnumbered; the largest numbers of riders from a nation were Italians at 52, with the next largest coming from France (50) and Belgium (28). Riders represented a further six nations, all European.

Of the start list of 150, 66 were riding the Tour de France for the first time. The total number of riders who finished the race was 94, a record high to that point. The average age of riders in the race was 27.5 years, ranging from 21-year-old Tiziano Galvanin () to 40-year-old <a href="Pino%20Cerami">Pino Cerami</a> (). The cyclists had the youngest average age (25.2) while cyclists had the oldest (30). The presentation of the teams – where the members of each team's roster are introduced in front of the media and local dignitaries – took place outside the in <a href="Nancy%2C%20France">Nancy</a> before the start of the opening stage in the city.

The teams entering the race were:

Majority of French cyclists

Majority of Italian cyclists
Majority of Belgian cyclists

The leading contender for the overall <a href="general%20classification%20in%20the%20Tour%20de%20France">general classification</a> before the Tour was the defending champion <a href="Jacques%20Anquetil">Jacques Anquetil</a> of the Saint-Raphaël team. His closest rivals were thought to be <a href="Rik%20Van%20Looy">Rik Van Looy</a> (Flandria) and <a href="Raymond%20Poulidor">Raymond Poulidor</a> (Mercier). The other riders considered contenders for the general classification were <a href="Rudi%20Altig">Rudi Altig</a> (Saint-Raphaël), <a href="Charly%20Gaul">Charly Gaul</a> (Gazzola), <a href="Federico%20Bahamontes">Federico Bahamontes</a> (Margnat), <a href="Gastone%20Nencini">Gastone Nencini</a> (Ignis), <a href="Henry%20Anglade">Henry Anglade</a> (Liberia), <a href="Guido%20Carlesi">Guido Carlesi</a> (Philco), <a href="Tom%20Simpson">Tom Simpson</a> (Gitane–Leroux), <a href="Ercole%20Baldini">Ercole Baldini</a> (Ignis) and <a href="Hans%20Junkermann">Hans Junkermann</a> (). Of these, three were former winners of the Tour: Gaul (<a href="1958%20Tour%20de%20France">1958</a>), Bahamontes (<a href="1959%20Tour%20de%20France">1959</a>) and Nencini (<a href="1960%20Tour%20de%20France">1960</a>).

Frenchman Anquetil, who also won the Tour in <a href="1957%20Tour%20de%20France">1957</a>, had dominated the 1961 Tour, leading it from the first day to the last, with a winning margin of over twelve minutes. Less than two months before the 1962 Tour, Anquetil had withdrawn from the <a href="1962%20Vuelta%20a%20Espa%C3%B1a">Vuelta a España</a>, the previous <a href="Grand%20Tour%20%28cycling%29">Grand Tour</a>, before the final stage due to <a href="viral%20hepatitis">viral hepatitis</a>. Although he was the team leader, he was 32nd in the general classification at the time of his withdrawal, while his teammate Altig won the race. Observers expected some internal team struggle in the Tour due to a possible rivalry between the pair over leadership. After recovering for ten days, Anquetil went against his doctor's orders and rode the week-long stage race <a href="Crit%C3%A9rium%20du%20Dauphin%C3%A9">Critérium du Dauphiné</a>, finishing seventh overall. Anquetil's former bitter rival <a href="Rapha%C3%ABl%20G%C3%A9miniani">Raphaël Géminiani</a> was then selected as the team manager of Saint-Raphaël for the Tour. Unhappy, Anquetil asked his sponsors to replace Géminiani; they declined his request.

Van Looy, the winner of the previous two <a href="UCI%20Road%20World%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20road%20race">world road race championships</a>, made his Tour debut in 1962. He had avoided riding the Tour because he thought he did not have the full support of the Belgium team, but with Flandria he had control over rider selection. He had a successful season leading up to the Tour, winning the <a href="Classic%20cycle%20races">one-day classics</a> <a href="Paris%E2%80%93Roubaix">Paris–Roubaix</a>, the <a href="Tour%20of%20Flanders">Tour of Flanders</a> and <a href="Gent%E2%80%93Wevelgem">Gent–Wevelgem</a>, and two stages of the <a href="1962%20Giro%20d%27Italia">Giro d'Italia</a> Grand Tour. He crashed during training four days before the Tour which caused a muscular stretch in his left thigh. Although Van Looy was known as a one-day classics specialist, he was considered a threat to Anquetil, who himself named Van Looy as the only rider who concerned him, fearing the high number of "flat" stage wins could potentially add up to eight minutes due to the one minute bonuses given to stage winners. A "duel" between him and Anquetil was billed by the press.

Poulidor was in his third year as a professional, and was more popular in his home country than his compatriot Anquetil. In 1961, he won the national road race championship and <a href="Milan%E2%80%93San%20Remo">Milan–San Remo</a> one-day classic. It was his first appearance in the Tour; he did not ride the 1961 race on the advice of his trade team manager, <a href="Antonin%20Magne">Antonin Magne</a>, who did not want him riding as a <a href="domestique">domestique</a> for Anquetil and undermining his 'commercial value'. Anquetil dismissed the media's prediction that Poulidor was his rival, saying: "All Poulidor does is follow. He never takes the initiative." In training in the lead up to the Tour, Poulidor broke his left little finger and began the race with a <a href="Orthopedic%20cast">cast</a> on his forearm.

The route for the 1962 Tour was announced on 14 December 1961. Notable features of the route were the absence of rest days and four <a href="time%20trial">time trial</a> events over a total of , which was unusually high, more than in the previous Tour. Anquetil said that he did not fear the mountains and that although the time trials favoured him, he would not object if they were not included. Both Van Looy and Gaston Nencini complained about the number of time trials. Van Looy threatened not to ride, feeling it was too hard, and the time trials did not suit him, saying "Four times, you are crazy. Why not a normal route? I will not start this Tour. I do not intend to play for three weeks."

The opening stage (known as the <a href="List%20of%20Tour%20de%20France%20Grands%20D%C3%A9parts">"Grand Départ"</a>) started in Nancy, in north-eastern France. The stage passed through <a href="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a> and ended in the Belgian town of <a href="Spa%2C%20Belgium">Spa</a>. Belgium hosted stages 2a, and 2b, in <a href="Herentals">Herentals</a>, and the beginning of the third in Brussels. This stage brought the race into northern France with the finish in <a href="Amiens">Amiens</a>. Stage four headed to the coast, westwards to <a href="Le%20Havre">Le Havre</a>, with the following two stages taking the Tour along a coastal route to the western tip of the country. Stages seven to ten formed a continuous journey along the west coast to the foot of the <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a> at <a href="Bayonne">Bayonne</a>. The Pyrenees hosted the next four stages, with the fourteenth finishing in <a href="Carcassonne">Carcassonne</a>. Stages fifteen to seventeen took the race to the south-east at <a href="Antibes">Antibes</a>. Stage eighteen headed north to <a href="Brian%C3%A7on">Briançon</a>, in the <a href="Alps">Alps</a>. The nineteenth stage moved the race out of the mountains and down to <a href="Aix-les-Bains">Aix-les-Bains</a>. The final three stages took the Tour back to the north through <a href="Lyon">Lyon</a> and <a href="Nevers">Nevers</a> to finish at the <a href="Parc%20des%20Princes">Parc des Princes</a> stadium in Paris.

There were 22 stages in the race, including two split stages, covering a total distance of , shorter than the 1961 Tour. The longest <a href="mass%20start">mass-start</a> stage was the 22nd at , and stage 2a was the shortest at . Of the four time trial stages, three (8b, 13, and 20) were <a href="individual%20time%20trial">individual time trial</a> events and one (2b) a <a href="team%20time%20trial">team time trial</a>. There was only one <a href="summit">summit</a> finish, in stage 13's time trial to the <a href="Superbagn%C3%A8res">Superbagnères</a> ski resort. On stage 18, the climb to the summit of the <a href="Cime%20de%20la%20Bonette">Cime de la Bonette</a> Alpine mountain, including the <a href="Col%20de%20Restefond">Col de Restefond</a> and <a href="Col%20de%20la%20Bonette">Col de la Bonette</a> passes, was used for the first time in the Tour in 1962. At an altitude of , it is one of the <a href="List%20of%20highest%20paved%20roads%20in%20Europe">highest paved roads in Europe</a> and the highest point of elevation reached in the history of the Tour (as of <a href="2018%20Tour%20de%20France">2018</a>). The Bonette was among six first-category rated climbs in the race. The Tour included four new start or finish locations: Spa, in stages 1 and 2; Herentals, in stages 2a and 2b; <a href="Lu%C3%A7on">Luçon</a>, in stages 8a and 8b; and Nevers, in stages 21 and 22. In 1962, the final of each stage of the Tour was broadcast live on television for the first time.

In the opening stage, a 23-man <a href="Breakaway%20%28cycling%29">breakaway</a> group of riders escaped the <a href="peloton">peloton</a> (main group) as they passed <a href="Luxembourg%20City">Luxembourg City</a> with remaining. They stayed away and came to the finish over six minutes ahead, with Rudi Altig winning the <a href="sprint%20finish">sprint</a>, and taking the first yellow jersey as leader of the general classification. Rik Van Looy, third on the stage, was denied the opportunity to wear the yellow jersey in his own country and into his home town of Herentals at the end of the following stage. Of the pre-race favourites, Raymond Poulidor, Charly Gaul and Federico Bahamontes were not present in the lead group. Altig also took the <a href="Points%20classification%20in%20the%20Tour%20de%20France">points classification</a>'s green jersey, and Liberia rider Jean Selic led the <a href="Mountains%20classification%20in%20the%20Tour%20de%20France">mountains classification</a>. The first half of the second stage ended with a <a href="bunch%20sprint">bunch sprint</a> won by <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Darrigade">André Darrigade</a> of Gitane–Leroux. Van Looy escaped close to the end but took a wrong turn; he placed fourth. Darrigade, second previously, took the yellow and green jerseys, with <a href="Angelino%20Soler">Angelino Soler</a> of Ghigi taking the lead of the mountains classification. The team time trial that took place in Herentals later in the day was won by Flandria; their winning margin over second-place Gitane–Leroux was 1 min 15 s, and moved four of their riders into the top ten. Altig retook the yellow jersey in stage three's sprint from a breakaway consisting of 41 riders. Gaul and Bahamontes lost further time, finishing in the peloton over five minutes in arrears.

In the fourth stage, Mercier's <a href="Willy%20Vanden%20Berghen">Willy Vanden Berghen</a> won the sprint finish between a group of six that went clear with around to go. Altig reclaimed the green jersey. Stage five ended in a bunch sprint won by Philco rider <a href="Emile%20Daems">Emile Daems</a>, with Gitane–Leroux's <a href="Rolf%20Wolfshohl">Rolf Wolfshohl</a> taking the lead of the mountains classification. In the sixth stage, a 16-man (15 at the end) group escaped in and held on to the finish at <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a>, with <a href="Robert%20Cazala">Robert Cazala</a> of Mercier winning the sprint. Altig and Anquetil were not there, but they had sent their teammate <a href="Albertus%20Geldermans">Albertus Geldermans</a> to protect the team's interests. Geldermans was the best-placed man in the break, and their finishing margin of over five minutes was so large that Geldermans became the new overall leader. Flandria's <a href="Huub%20Zilverberg">Huub Zilverberg</a> won stage seven from a two-way sprint with Gitane–Leroux's <a href="Bas%20Maliepaard">Bas Maliepaard</a>; the pair attacked from a breakaway of twenty riders in the final and finished five seconds ahead at the finish in <a href="Saint-Nazaire">Saint-Nazaire</a>. As the chasing breakaway went through a narrow section of the finishing straight, Gastone Nencini hit a <a href="gendarmerie">gendarme</a> (French police officer) and fell, also bringing down Darrigade. Most of the stages in the first week were unusually fast; stage seven was calculated to be , the fastest recorded to that point above a distance of .
In the first part of the eighth stage, another large group escaped, which in the final kilometres had merged with a further chasing breakaway and ended with a sprint victory for Ghigi rider <a href="Mario%20Minieri">Mario Minieri</a> in Luçon's <a href="velodrome">velodrome</a>. Breakaway rider Darrigade became the new general classification leader for the second time in the race. The flat individual time trial from Luçon to La Rochelle in the second part of the stage was won by Anquetil, with Ercole Baldini second, 22 seconds behind. Darrigade briefly held the green jersey after stage 8a before it returned to Altig after 8b. Because of a successful breakaway in stage nine, Darrigade lost the lead to Flandria rider <a href="Willy%20Schroeders">Willy Schroeders</a>; Carpano's <a href="Antonio%20Bailetti">Antonio Bailetti</a> won the stage. <a href="Willy%20Vannitsen">Willy Vannitsen</a> of won the tenth stage's bunch sprint. The following stage was won by Vannitsen's teammate <a href="Eddy%20Pauwels">Eddy Pauwels</a>, who <a href="Drop%20%28cycling%29">dropped</a> his fellow breakaway riders and soloed to victory with a four-minute advantage at <a href="Pau%2C%20Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es-Atlantiques">Pau</a>'s motor race street circuit. A crash into the stage involving 22 riders was caused by a motorbike carrying a photographer. Van Looy, whose back was injured by the motorbike's handlebars, was the most notable casualty; he was able to continue for a further , before he was advised to retire from the race by the Tour's doctor, <a href="Pierre%20Dumas">Pierre Dumas</a>.

Stage twelve, the first mountain stage in the Pyrenees, saw Cazala take his second win from a sprint between an elite group of <a href="Climbing%20specialist">climbers</a> and overall favourites that finished together after the descent to <a href="Saint-Gaudens%2C%20Haute-Garonne">Saint-Gaudens</a>. Schroeders could not keep up with this group, which included British rider Tom Simpson, and Simpson took the overall lead, becoming the first non-<a href="Continental%20Europe">mainland European</a> in history to wear the yellow jersey. Bahamontes led over the first-category <a href="Col%20du%20Tourmalet">Col du Tourmalet</a>, and the two other lower categorised climbs, to take the lead in the mountains classification. The next stage, an mountain time trial, was won by Bahamontes with a time of 47 min 23 s. Simpson placed 31st and lost the lead to <a href="Jef%20Planckaert">Jef Planckaert</a> of Flandria, who came in second place, 1 min 25 s down. Anquetil finished a further three seconds behind in third and sat fourth overall. Planckaert had taken over the leadership of Flandria after the departure of Van Looy, with former race leader Schroeders pledging his support. He was considered an able substitute due to his form during the season leading up to the Tour, winning the stage races <a href="1962%20Paris%E2%80%93Nice">Paris–Nice</a> and the <a href="Tour%20de%20Luxembourg">Tour de Luxembourg</a> and the one-day classic <a href="1962%20Li%C3%A8ge%E2%80%93Bastogne%E2%80%93Li%C3%A8ge">Liège–Bastogne–Liège</a>. The final Pyrenean stage, the fourteenth, saw Saint-Raphaël rider <a href="Jean%20Stablinski">Jean Stablinski</a> attack his 10-strong breakaway with remaining and solo to the finish in Carcassonne with a margin of twelve seconds. The first of the three transitional stages, fifteen, that crossed France's southern coastline ended in a bunch sprint won by Vannitsen. In stage sixteen, Daems and Bailetti escaped the peloton with to go, with Daems attacking to win with a margin of three minutes; the chasing group of seven came in eight minutes later. Altig won the seventeenth stage in a sprint from a four-rider breakaway that finished over six minutes ahead of the peloton.
In the first of the two Alpine stages, the eighteenth, attacks were expected. Instead, the riders went at a slow pace; in the first four hours, they had only raced . Later, some attacks took place, but they failed because of punctured tires and the defending tactics of the leading riders; in the end, Daems, who was a sprinter and not a climber, was able to win this mountain stage. Poulidor's injured hand was better by stage nineteen, and his team manager told him that it was time to attack. He was placed ninth in the general classification, ten minutes behind, so he would have not likely been seen as a threat. Attacking over the final climbs, he soloed to the finish at Aix-les-Bains with an advantage of more than three minutes over his rivals, moving him to third place overall, 5 min 43 s in arrears, with Planckaert still leading and Anquetil second, 1 min 8 s down. In stage twenty, a individual time trial finishing in Lyon, Planckaert came in fourth place, losing 5 min 19 s to the winner, Anquetil, who took the overall lead. Anquetil was a time trial specialist and considered unbeatable at the time. Baldini placed second, 2 min 59 s off the time set by Anquetil, and third was Poulidor who came in 5 min 1 s down to keep his third place overall. Stage 21 ended in a bunch sprint won by <a href="Dino%20Bruni">Dino Bruni</a> of Gazzola.

In the final stage, Benedetti gained his second victory of the race from a bunch sprint in front of an estimated crowd of 30,000 at Parc des Princes. Anquetil finished the race to claim his third Tour de France, equalling the record number of Tour wins by a rider with Belgian <a href="Philippe%20Thys">Philippe Thys</a> and Frenchman <a href="Louison%20Bobet">Louison Bobet</a>. It was revealed later that Anquetil had ridden the race with <a href="Cestoda">tapeworm</a>. He beat second-placed Planckaert by 4 min 59 s, with Poulidor third, a further 5 min 25 s down. Altig won the points classification with a total of 173, which was 29 ahead of Daems in second. Bahamontes won the mountains classification with 137 points, 60 ahead of second-placed <a href="Imerio%20Massignan">Imerio Massignan</a> (). Saint-Raphaël won the team classification, which they led from the opening stage, with Mercier coming second and Flandria third. The riders with the most stages wins were Altig and Daems, with three each.

During the night after the thirteenth stage, pre-race outsider Hans Junkermann became ill. He was placed seventh in the general classification, and the following day, stage fourteen, his team requested the start be delayed, which the organisation allowed. He was dropped by the peloton on the first climb in, and abandoned the race, saying "bad fish" was the cause. Fourteen riders withdrew from the Tour that day, all blaming food poisoning from rotten fish at the same hotel, including the former general classification leader Willy Schroeder and another pre-race contender Gastone Nencini. Writing in the French sports newspaper "<a href="L%27%C3%89quipe">L'Équipe</a>", the Tour's race director, <a href="Jacques%20Goddet">Jacques Goddet</a>, said he did not believe their excuse and believed they had <a href="Doping%20in%20sport">doped</a> to recover time lost in the previous stage's time trial. Nothing was proven, although the hotel said they did not serve fish that night. A <a href="communiqu%C3%A9">communiqué</a> released by the Pierre Dumas warned that if riders and their "<a href="soigneur">soigneur</a>s" did not stop "certain forms of preparation," there would be daily post-stage hotel room inspections. Upset by this and doping accusations in the press, the riders threatened a fifteen-minute strike, but the journalist <a href="Jean%20Bobet">Jean Bobet</a>, a former cyclist, was able to talk them into continuing, although he later provided the commentary for the documentary film about the 1962 Tour, "<a href="Vive%20le%20Tour">Vive le Tour</a>" by <a href="Louis%20Malle">Louis Malle</a>, which ridiculed the riders and their "bad fish" explanation. In the following days, Dumas began to organise the inaugural European Conference on Doping and the Biological Preparation of the Competitive Athlete, which took place in January 1963. Since four of the riders involved came from , more than from any other team, the scandal is referred to as the "Wiel's affair".

There were three main individual classifications contested in the 1962 Tour de France, two of which award <a href="Cycling%20jersey">jerseys</a> to their leaders, and also a team competition. The most important was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses were awarded to the top two positions at the end of every stage, including the individual time trials, but not the team time trial; first place received 1 minute and second place got 30 seconds. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Tour. The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey.

In the points classification, riders were awarded points for finishing in the top fifteen places on each stage. The first rider at each stage finish was awarded 25 points, the second 20 points, the third 16 points, the fourth 14 points, the fifth 12 points, the sixth 10 points, down to 1 point for the rider in fifteenth. The classification leader was identified by a green jersey.

The mountains classification awarded points to the riders who reached summits first. Most stages of the race included one or more of these climbs, categorised as fourth-, third-, second- or first-category, with the more difficult climbs rated lower. The calculation for the mountains classification was changed in 1962, and the fourth category was added. The leader of the classification was not identified by a jersey.

The classification for the teams was calculated by adding together the times of the first three cyclists of a team on each stage; the team with the lowest combined time on a stage won one first place point. To determine placings in the overall team classification, second and third place points were also awarded. The split stages (two and eight) were each combined. The riders on the team who led this classification were identified with yellow <a href="casquette">caps</a>.

In addition, there was a <a href="Combativity%20award%20in%20the%20Tour%20de%20France">combativity award</a> given after each stage to the most aggressive rider; the decision was made by a jury composed of journalists. The split stages each had a combined winner. At the conclusion of the Tour, Eddy Pauwels won the overall super-combativity award, also decided by journalists. Similar to the award for most combative rider, there was an award for the unluckiest rider given after every stage. The award for most bad luck during the entire Tour went to Rik Van Looy. Two further individual awards were given at the end of the Tour, the Prix Alex Virot, awarded to Raymond Poulidor for being the most loyal rider in the race, determined by a jury, and the Prix René Dunan, awarded to the 22-year-old <a href="Giorgo%20Zancanaro">Giorgo Zancanaro</a> (Philco) for being the youngest finisher.

A total of 3,000,000 <a href="French%20franc">French new francs</a> (NF) was awarded in cash prizes in the race, with the overall winner of the general classification receiving 200,000 NF. The points and mountains classification winners got 100,000 NF and 50,000 NF, respectively. The team classification winners were given 300,000 NF. The winner of the super-combativity award winner was given 60,000 NF and a <a href="Renault%208%20and%2010">Renault R8</a> car, and the unluckiest rider overall got 20,000 NF. The Prix Alex Virot was given 25,000 NF and the Prix René Dunan got 20,000 NF. There was also a special award with a prize of 3,000 NF, the <a href="Souvenir%20Henri%20Desgrange">Souvenir Henri Desgrange</a>, given to the first rider (<a href="Juan%20Campillo">Juan Campillo</a> of Margnat) to pass the summit of the -high <a href="Col%20du%20Lautaret">Col du Lautaret</a> on stage nineteen.

Riders in the Tour competed individually for points that contributed towards the <a href="Super%20Prestige%20Pernod%20International">Super Prestige Pernod</a>, an international season-long road cycling competition, with the winner seen as the best all-round rider. The 90 points accrued by Jacques Anquetil moved him from outside the rankings to fourth place, whilst Jef Planckaert climbed from third position to take the lead from former leader Rik Van Looy.

Lionel Palairet

Lionel Charles Hamilton Palairet (27 May 1870 – 27 March 1933) was an English <a href="History%20of%20English%20amateur%20cricket">amateur</a> <a href="cricket">cricket</a>er who played for <a href="Somerset%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Somerset</a> and <a href="Oxford%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Oxford University</a>. A graceful right-handed batsman, he was selected to play <a href="Test%20cricket">Test cricket</a> for <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England</a> twice in 1902. Contemporaries judged Palairet to have one of the most attractive batting styles of the period. His obituary in "The Times" described him as "the most beautiful batsman of all time". An unwillingness to tour during the English winter limited Palairet's Test appearances; contemporaries believed he deserved more <a href="Cricket%20cap">Test caps</a>.

Palairet was educated at <a href="Repton%20School">Repton School</a>. He played in the school cricket team for four years, as captain in the latter two, before going to <a href="Oriel%20College%2C%20Oxford">Oriel College, Oxford</a>. He achieved his cricketing <a href="Blue%20%28university%20sport%29">Blue</a> in each of his four years at Oxford, and captained the side in 1892 and 1893. For Somerset, he frequently opened the batting with <a href="Herbie%20Hewett">Herbie Hewett</a>. In 1892, <a href="Partnership%20%28cricket%29">they shared a partnership</a> of 346 for the first wicket, an opening stand that set a record for the County Championship and remains Somerset's highest first-wicket partnership. In that season, Palairet was named as one of the "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">Five Batsmen of the Year</a>" by "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden</a>".

Over the following decade, he was one of the leading amateur batsmen in England. He passed 1,000 first-class runs in a season on seven occasions, and struck two double centuries. His highest score, 292 runs against <a href="Hampshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Hampshire</a> in 1895, remained a record for a Somerset batsman until 1948. His only Test matches were the fourth and fifth Tests against Australia in 1902: Australia won the fourth Test by three runs, and England won the fifth Test by one wicket. After 1904, he appeared infrequently for Somerset, though he played a full season in 1907 when he was chosen to captain the county. He retired from first-class cricket in 1909, having scored over 15,000 runs.

Lionel Palairet was born in <a href="Grange-over-Sands">Grange-over-Sands</a>, a popular <a href="seaside%20resort">seaside resort</a> in <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, on 27 May 1870. He was the oldest of five children born to <a href="Henry%20Palairet">Henry Hamilton Palairet</a> and Elizabeth Anne Bigg. His father, of <a href="Huguenot">Huguenot</a> ancestry, was five times <a href="archery">archery</a> champion of England, and a keen cricketer who made two <a href="First-class%20cricket">first-class</a> appearances for the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC) in the late 1860s. Palairet was educated first at the Reverend S. Cornish's School in <a href="Clevedon">Clevedon</a>, Somerset, where he once took seven <a href="Wicket%23Dismissing%20a%20batsman">wickets</a> in seven successive <a href="Delivery%20%28cricket%29">deliveries</a>, and then at <a href="Repton%20School">Repton School</a>. At Repton he developed a reputation as an all-round sportsman: he broke the school's <a href="Middle-distance%20running">running</a> records in the two-mile, mile and half-mile distances, and played cricket in the school's <a href="first%20eleven">first eleven</a> from 1886 to 1889, captaining the team in his final two years. In 1889, he was adjudged the school's second best sportsman, behind only <a href="C.%20B.%20Fry">C. B. Fry</a>. During his final year at Repton, he had a <a href="Batting%20average%23Cricket">batting average</a> of over 29, and took 56 wickets at an <a href="Bowling%20average">average</a> of under 13.

Some of Palairet's early success can be attributed to his father, who paid the professionals <a href="Frederick%20Martin%20%28cricketer%29">Frederick Martin</a> and <a href="William%20Attewell">William Attewell</a>, both later <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">"Wisden" Cricketers of the Year</a>, to bowl at his two sons during the Easter holidays, to help them prepare for the upcoming cricket season. During the later part of the 1889 season, Palairet made his first appearances for <a href="Somerset%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Somerset County Cricket Club</a>. At the time, Somerset were a second-class county, and their fixture list that summer was against a variety of first- and second-class opposition. Although a Lancastrian by birth, Palairet's family home was at <a href="Cattistock">Cattistock</a> in <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a>, and it was in the south west that he chose to play his cricket. On completion of his studies at Repton, he attended <a href="Oriel%20College%2C%20Oxford">Oriel College, Oxford</a>.

Palairet was selected for the <a href="Oxford%20University%20Cricket%20Club">university cricket team</a> during his first year at Oxford, and made his first-class debut against the touring <a href="Australia%20national%20cricket%20team">Australians</a> in May 1890. Palairet scored six and nought and took one wicket in the match which Australia won by an innings. In his next match, Palairet improved, top-scoring for Oxford in their first innings against the <a href="Gentlemen%20v%20Players">Gentlemen</a> with his first half-century in first-class cricket, 54 runs batting at <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">number eight</a>. He only passed 50 runs in one other innings for Oxford that summer, a score of 72 against the MCC, and in all matches for the university that season scored 285 runs at an average of 19.00. Batting averages in 1890 were lower than usual due to the poor weather, and Palairet's average placed him fourth among Oxford's team; his 285-run total was the team's second highest aggregate. Palairet won his <a href="Blue%20%28university%20sport%29">Blue</a>—the awarding of the Oxford "colours" to sportsmen—by appearing in the 1890 <a href="The%20University%20Match%20%28cricket%29">University match</a> against <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Cambridge</a>, a game in which he had little success. Somerset played thirteen matches in the season, won twelve of them and <a href="Result%20%28cricket%29%23Tie">tied</a> the other. Palairet played in ten of these games, and on his first appearance scored a <a href="Century%20%28cricket%29">century</a> against <a href="Leicestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Leicestershire</a>. Somerset's achievements led to their admission to first-class cricket for 1891.

Oxford's batting was described by the Oxford cricket historian Geoffrey Bolton as "unreliable" during 1891, Palairet's second year at the university. Palairet's batting average of 15.78 placed him fifth amongst his peers, and he once again struggled in the University match, scoring two and eleven. Although he generally batted as part of the middle order for Oxford, he invariably opened the innings for Somerset alongside his captain, <a href="Herbie%20Hewett">Herbie Hewett</a>. In this role he thrived for Somerset; his average for the county in ten matches was 31.11, placing him among the top ten batsmen in the <a href="County%20Championship">County Championship</a>. He scored his debut century in first-class cricket that year, with 100 runs against <a href="Gloucestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Gloucestershire</a>. Palairet had agreed to <a href="Lord%20Hawke%27s%20XI%20cricket%20team%20in%20North%20America%20in%201891%E2%80%9392">tour North America</a> with <a href="Martin%20Hawke%2C%207th%20Baron%20Hawke">Lord Hawke</a>'s party, but he demurred late, and was replaced by Somerset teammate <a href="Sammy%20Woods">Sammy Woods</a>.

In 1892 Palairet was elected captain of the Oxford team, and according to "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden</a>", "had a most brilliant season." Palairet used himself heavily as a bowler for the university; only <a href="George%20Berkeley%20%28cricketer%29">George Berkeley</a> bowled more deliveries. He took five wickets in an innings for the first of two occasions during his career in the first innings of Oxford's match against the Gentlemen, and followed it up with four wickets in each innings against Lancashire, a match in which he also scored a half-century. He recorded the best bowling figures of his first-class career in the return match against Lancashire, taking six wickets for 84 runs at <a href="Old%20Trafford%20Cricket%20Ground">Old Trafford</a>, and in the following game against Sussex, Bolton says, "Palairet played two beautiful innings and bowled to some effect". Facing Cambridge in the University match, he was out without scoring in the first innings, but centuries from <a href="Malcolm%20Jardine">Malcolm Jardine</a> and <a href="Vernon%20Hill">Vernon Hill</a> took Oxford to 365. Cambridge were dismissed for 160, and were forced to <a href="follow%20on">follow on</a>, whereupon they reached 388, leaving Oxford requiring 184 runs to win. Palairet, who had injured himself while fielding, opted not to open the batting, promoting <a href="Frank%20Phillips%20%28cricketer%29">Frank Phillips</a> in his place. Oxford started poorly, falling to 17 for two, but coming in at number five, Palairet batted for an hour and a half to score 71 runs and help his side to victory. He topped the batting averages for Oxford in 1892, scoring 509 runs at 36.35, and his 28 wickets came at 22.28.
Palairet's university performances were good enough to earn him selection for <a href="Gentlemen%20v%20Players">the Gentlemen against the Players</a> in the prestigious matches at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a> and <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a>. Returning to Somerset, he struck a century against Gloucestershire in early July, In late August, playing <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a>, Palairet scored 132 out of a partnership of 346 with Hewett, establishing a record for the first wicket in first-class cricket, surpassing <a href="W.%20G.%20Grace">W. G. Grace</a> and <a href="Bransby%20Cooper">Bransby Cooper</a>'s 1869 total of 283. Although their record has since been beaten in first-class cricket, it remains Somerset's record partnership for the first wicket. Their partnership was described as "Pure grace at one end, sheer force at the other", in <a href="Harry%20Altham">H.S. Altham</a> and <a href="E.%20W.%20Swanton">E. W. Swanton</a>'s "A History of Cricket". At the time, "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" reported that the pair remained together for three and a half hours, during which Palairet scored one <a href="Boundary%20%28cricket%29%23Scoring%20runs">six</a> and nineteen fours. At the end of the season, he was selected in two representative sides: appearing for the <a href="West%20of%20England%20cricket%20team">West</a> against the <a href="East%20of%20England%20cricket%20team">East</a>, and once again for the Gentlemen against the Players, on this occasion at <a href="Central%20Recreation%20Ground">Hastings</a>. In all first-class matches that year, he scored 1,343 runs, the third most of any cricketer. He was named as one of the <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">Five Batsmen of the Year</a> by the "Wisden Cricketers' Almanack" in 1893, which noted that "there can be little doubt that even greater distinction awaits him in the cricket world."

In contrast to the previous year, 1893 was an unsuccessful one for Oxford. The university side failed to win a single match, and despite favourable batting conditions, none of the batsmen scored a century. Palairet was second in the batting averages, scoring 276 runs at 21.23. Bolton questioned the team selections that year under Palairet's captaincy, particularly for the University match, in which he believed a stronger team could have been chosen. Cambridge had a powerful team, containing eight of their players from the previous year, and adding <a href="Arthur%20Jones%20%28cricketer%29">Arthur Jones</a> and <a href="K.%20S.%20Ranjitsinhji">K. S. Ranjitsinhji</a>. Oxford lost the match by 266 runs, with only Palairet and Fry scoring more than 12 runs for the side.

In his four years at Oxford, Palairet appeared for the university 31 times in first-class cricket and accrued 1,291 runs at an average of 23.05. He scored nine half-centuries, with a top-score of 75 <a href="not%20out">not out</a>. He claimed 52 wickets at 25.03—significantly lower than his career average—and took the only five-wicket hauls of his career. While at Oxford, he also gained a Blue in athletics, running in the three-mile race against Cambridge in 1892. The same year, he played <a href="association%20football">association football</a> for <a href="Corinthian%20F.C.">Corinthians</a>, and there were also appearances for Combined Universities and London. An injury prevented Palairet from playing against Cambridge, and thus earning his Blue in football.

Over the following seasons, Palairet moved to "the front rank of amateur batsmen," according to W. G. Grace. He played for <a href="Arthur%20Shrewsbury">Arthur Shrewsbury</a>'s England XI against Australia in 1893, and scored 71 runs as the English side won by an innings and 153 runs. He scored five half-centuries for Somerset that summer, and his batting average of 28.94 in the County Championship was bettered only by Hewett among his teammates. The next year, Palairet made a big score against his former university. Facing a team that included his brother, <a href="Richard%20Palairet">Richard Palairet</a>, and was captained by Fry, he made 181 runs in Somerset's second innings, the highest first-class score of his career to that point. He also scored a century against <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a>, making 119 runs before being out <a href="leg%20before%20wicket">leg before wicket</a> to his old trainer Attewell. He fell just short of 1,000 first-class runs in 1894; though two half-centuries scored against the <a href="South%20African%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201894">touring South Africans</a> in matches not considered first-class would have taken him over the milestone.

In 1895, Palairet was fourth in the national batting averages, having scored 1,313 runs at 46.89. The three batsmen above him, <a href="Archie%20MacLaren">Archie MacLaren</a>, Grace and Ranjitsinhji all appeared for England that year. Palairet scored three centuries during the season; two against Middlesex, on the latter occasion <a href="Carry%20the%20bat">batting undefeated through the whole Somerset innings</a>, and one against Yorkshire, when he struck 165. He passed a thousand runs again the following year, maintaining a batting average in excess of 40. A fourth-innings score of 83 not out that season drew praise from Ranjitsinhji; on a difficult <a href="Cricket%20pitch">pitch</a>, Palairet <a href="Glossary%20of%20cricket%20terms%23S">farmed the strike</a> and rescued a draw for his side. Just over a month later, he reached his highest total in first-class cricket, scoring 292 runs against <a href="Hampshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Hampshire</a>. It was his first double century, and the highest score by any Somerset batsman in first-class cricket at that time. One newspaper in Australia, reporting on his innings, declared that; "should he retain his form he will certainly be worthy of a place ... in the final Test match at the Oval." Either side of that match against Hampshire, he appeared for the Gentlemen against the Players at The Oval and Lord's, but made little impact on either game. He returned to form against Sussex on their visit to Taunton, sharing a 249-run partnership with his brother, and scoring 154 runs himself. The match was played shortly before the final Test match against Australia, but despite the comments in the Australian press, Palairet was not selected for the match. He did appear twice against the tourists that summer, for Somerset he scored six across two innings, and chosen to play for <a href="Charles%20Thornton%20%28cricketer%29">Charles Thornton</a>'s XI during the <a href="Scarborough%20Festival">Scarborough Festival</a>, he scored 71 runs in an innings victory.

In 1897 Palairet made fewer first-class appearances, playing in only 12 matches. He scored 593 runs at an average just below 30, the only time between 1895 and 1906 that his average was below that value. Despite this relatively quiet season, Somerset still relied heavily on him; he led the county batting averages in the 1897 County Championship. In 1898, Palairet topped 1,000 first-class runs for the third season out of four. He struck 179 not out against Gloucestershire in Bristol, and late in the season, also against Gloucestershire, he captained Somerset for the first time, leading them to victory by an innings and 169 runs. He played in two matches during the Scarborough Festival, in which he scored 54, his highest innings for the Gentlemen against the Players, and also appeared for Thornton's "England XI" against that season's county champions, Yorkshire.

Palairet missed all of the 1899 season through <a href="appendicitis">appendicitis</a>; "Baily's Magazine of Sports & Pastimes" suggested that but for this he might have appeared for England against Australia that summer. He returned in 1900, scoring 947 runs at an average of 35.07. His only century came against Hampshire, when he scored 161 runs, and shared a partnership of 262 with <a href="Charles%20Bernard%20%28cricketer%29">Charles Bernard</a>.

The subsequent 1901 season was, statistically, his best. He trailed only Fry and Ranjitsinhji in the national batting averages, and drew particular acclaim for his innings of 173 against Yorkshire. The all-conquering Yorkshire were reigning County Champions, unbeaten in 1900; the match against Somerset at <a href="Headingley%20Stadium">Headingley</a> was the only one they lost in 1901. Somerset were dismissed for 87 in their first innings, and Yorkshire reached 325 to lead by 238 runs on first innings. Palairet and his fellow opener <a href="Len%20Braund">Len Braund</a>—both of whom had been out without scoring in the first innings—then scored 222 runs together in 140 minutes at the start of Somerset's second innings, each scoring a century. After the dismissal of Braund for 107, Palairet continued, eventually being <a href="Caught">caught and bowled</a> for 173. Frank Phillips added a third century (122), and Somerset reached a total of 630. Yorkshire were bowled out on a wearing pitch for 113, with Braund and <a href="Beaumont%20Cranfield">Beaumont Cranfield</a> each taking four wickets, and Somerset won by 279 runs. The Yorkshire captain, Lord Hawke, declared that it was "one of the best matches I ever lost." In the same year, Palairet scored 182 against Lancashire and 194 against Sussex. Altogether he scored five centuries and eleven half-centuries in 1901, averaging 57.75 for his 1,906 runs—the highest season's total of his career.

The English summer of 1902 was badly affected by rain, making batting more difficult. Through the whole season, Palairet did not score a first-class century, though he did score over 1,000 runs. He was once again instrumental in inflicting defeat on Yorkshire: on what <a href="Sir%20Home%20Gordon%2C%2012th%20Baronet">Sir Home Gordon</a> described as a "rain-ruined wicket", Palairet scored 25 and 24 during a match in which only Braund also reached double-figure scores in both innings. "Wisden" described the pair's batting as "admirable", and it helped secure a Somerset victory by 34 runs; for the second successive year, Somerset were the only side to beat Yorkshire in the County Championship.

Palairet was selected to appear for the Marylebone Cricket Club against the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201902">touring Australians</a> in the week prior to the first Test of the series. He scored 39 and 44 in a drawn match. He was not chosen to play in any of the first three Tests, but was called up for the fourth match, at Old Trafford. Palairet, Ranjitsinhji and <a href="Fred%20Tate">Fred Tate</a> replaced Fry, <a href="George%20Hirst">George Hirst</a> and <a href="Gilbert%20Jessop">Gilbert Jessop</a>; the "Wisden" match report indicates that dropping Fry was a necessary decision, but that Hirst and Jessop should both have played. In "A History of Cricket", Altham is more direct in claiming that Palairet should not have been chosen: "The selectors, it is now agreed, made a questionable choice in preferring Lionel Palairet to an all-rounder such as Hirst." On his Test debut, Palairet opened the batting and scored six runs in the first innings, one of five victims to fall to <a href="Jack%20Saunders%20%28cricketer%2C%20born%201876%29">Jack Saunders</a> and <a href="Hugh%20Trumble">Hugh Trumble</a> in the first 45 minutes of England's innings. In the second innings, Palairet once again opened, though with a different partner: MacLaren replaced <a href="Bobby%20Abel">Bobby Abel</a>. The pair made scored 44 runs together, though "Wisden" noted that "the difficulty they experienced in playing the bowling made one apprehensive". Palairet was bowled by Saunders, and England were eventually dismissed for 120, four runs short of victory.

For the next Test match—the fifth and final of the series—Palairet retained his place, with Hirst and Jessop restored to the side. The Australians batted throughout the first day for a total of 324 runs. Overnight rain then made batting difficult, and England totalled 183 on the second day. Palairet was dismissed for 20 by Trumble, whose bowling Altham praised as magnificent. Australia also struggled in their second innings, and England required 263 runs to win the match. Palairet was dismissed for six, the third batsman to be bowled by Trumble in the innings, at which point England's score was 10 for 3 wickets. Lower order runs from the recalled Jessop and Hirst recovered the innings, and England won by one wicket. In Palairet's only other match against Australia that summer, for Somerset, he scored 44 and 90 in a drawn game at Taunton. He made no further Test appearances, and completed his brief Test career with 49 runs at an average of 12.25, against an Australian side that has been described as among the best Test teams prior to the Second World War.

In 1903, Palairet played eleven first-class matches. His only century of the season came against <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a>, when he scored 114 in the second innings, having struck a half-century in the first. He passed 50 on three other occasions, and finished the year with 637 runs at 35.38. He appeared more frequently the following year, in which he scored 1,000 first-class runs in a season for the final time of his career. He opened the season with a century against Gloucestershire, scoring 166 runs. During the Bath cricket festival, he scored 111, and shared an opening partnership of 161 with Braund during a ten-wicket loss to Lancashire. Against <a href="Worcestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Worcestershire</a> later that month, he scored the second, and final, first-class double century of his career. Opening the batting for Somerset, he reached 203; more than Worcestershire had managed in their first innings, before being dismissed. Somerset won the match by an innings and 114 runs. The cricket historian David Foot describes 1904 and the subsequent few seasons as undistinguished for Somerset; between then and the First World War, the club never finished higher than tenth in the County Championship. Palairet missed most of the cricket in 1905 and 1906, to concentrate on his work as a <a href="land%20agent">land agent</a> for the <a href="Earl%20of%20Devon">Earl of Devon</a>. He played three times in 1905; against the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201905">touring Australians</a>, <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent</a> and <a href="Warwickshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Warwickshire</a>, while in 1906 he played one match, against Yorkshire. At the end of 1906, Woods, who had captained Somerset since 1894, retired. Despite his limited appearances over the previous couple of years, Palairet was appointed as Woods' replacement for 1907.

During the 1907 season, Palairet played in all of Somerset's County Championship matches, and also appeared for the county against the <a href="South%20African%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201907">touring South African side</a>. The club struggled to find eleven eligible players for some of their matches, and at one stage were forced to recall <a href="Ted%20Tyler">Ted Tyler</a> to the side – Tyler had not played for Somerset for four years, and had only played five matches since 1900. Palairet himself had a disappointing year; his batting average of 21.33 was the lowest in any season in which he played ten or more matches. He passed 50 in an innings on only three occasions, one of these being 116 runs against Kent at <a href="Angel%20Ground">Tonbridge</a>, the final century of his first-class career. At the end of the season, in which Somerset finished fourteenth of sixteen teams in the County Championship, Palairet resigned the captaincy. At the club's <a href="annual%20general%20meeting">annual general meeting</a>, in an uncharacteristic outburst he criticised the lack of talent and team spirit . After 1907, made only eight further appearances in first-class cricket, his final match being in 1909 for Somerset against Kent at Taunton, where he scored one run in the first innings and three in the second. Palairet invariably wore a <a href="Harlequins%20Cricket%20Club">Harlequins</a> cricket cap during matches, and was considered aloof by his colleagues. In his complete first-class career he scored 15,777 runs at an average of 33.63, including 27 centuries, and took 143 wickets at a bowling average of 33.91

Often considered by commentators to be the benchmark against which other batsmen are compared for attractive, graceful batting, Palairet won many plaudits for his style. In his book, "<a href="The%20Jubilee%20Book%20of%20Cricket">The Jubilee Book of Cricket</a>", Ranjitsinhji includes a number of staged photographs of Palairet playing his shots, and describes his methods in places, using them as the model which young players should adopt. He played predominantly off the front foot, and tended to be less effective on soft pitches. He favoured shots on the <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29">off side</a>, particularly the off drive and cover drive. During Palairet's career, bowlers favoured a tactic, known as <a href="off%20theory">off theory</a>, of bowling the ball just outside the off <a href="Stump%20%28cricket%29%23Part%20of%20the%20wicket">stump</a>. The strength of Palairet's off side strokes helped him to score effectively against this tactic. Fry suggests that the early practice that Palairet gained against Attewell and Martin, who bowled accurately at the stumps, was a key factor in limiting his range of <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29">leg side</a> shots. He favoured lofted shots which were often compared to golf strokes.

For a time early in his career, he attempted to play more powerfully, but then returned to his forward style. Despite this, he remained capable of hitting the ball out of the <a href="County%20Ground%2C%20Taunton">County Ground</a> in Taunton and into the <a href="River%20Tone">River Tone</a> at one end or the <a href="Church%20of%20St.%20James%2C%20Taunton">churchyard</a> at the other. Although considered a stylish batsman, Palairet was described by Foot as having "the minimum of extrovert flourish" and "no quaint mannerisms", both factors he considered relevant in Palairet's limited Test appearances. Throughout his career, Palairet shunned improvisation, and played well-established, orthodox cricket shots. He remained absolutely still at the crease while preparing to play a shot, a feature later seen in <a href="Viv%20Richards">Viv Richards</a>' batting.

Palairet married Caroline Mabel Laverton, the daughter of William Henry Laverton, a prominent cricket patron in Wiltshire, in 1894. The pair had two children: Evelyn Mabel Hamilton, born in 1895, and Henry Edward Hamilton the following year. Palairet's brother, <a href="Richard%20Palairet">Richard</a>, played first-class cricket for Somerset between 1891 and 1902, albeit without as much success as Lionel. In addition to cricket, Palairet maintained an interest in a range of other sports; a 1901 profile of him in "Baily's Magazine" records that foxhunting was his primary sporting interest. After his retirement from cricket, Palairet became a prominent <a href="golf">golf</a>er in the south-west. He was the first chairman of the Devon County Golf Union upon its formation in 1911, captained Devon at golf either side of the First World War, from 1914 through until 1926, and was also president of the Union from 1923 until 1932. He developed the idea of an inter-club team championship within Devon, and donated the prize, which remains named the Palairet Trophy. During the First World War, he had command of a Remount Depot at <a href="Powderham%20Castle">Powderham</a>, the seat of the Earl of Devon. He died in Exmouth on 27 March 1933, aged 62.

Evita (1996 film)

Evita is a 1996 American <a href="Musical%20film">musical</a> <a href="Drama%20%28film%20and%20television%29">drama film</a> based on the 1976 <a href="Evita%20%28album%29">concept album of the same name</a> produced by <a href="Tim%20Rice">Tim Rice</a> and <a href="Andrew%20Lloyd%20Webber">Andrew Lloyd Webber</a>, which also inspired a <a href="Evita%20%28musical%29">1978 musical</a>. The film depicts the life of <a href="Eva%20Per%C3%B3n">Eva Perón</a>, detailing her beginnings, rise to fame, political career and death at the age of 33. Directed by <a href="Alan%20Parker">Alan Parker</a>, and written by Parker and <a href="Oliver%20Stone">Oliver Stone</a>, "Evita" stars <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a> as Eva, <a href="Jonathan%20Pryce">Jonathan Pryce</a> as Eva's husband <a href="Juan%20Per%C3%B3n">Juan Perón</a>, and <a href="Antonio%20Banderas">Antonio Banderas</a> as Ché, an <a href="everyman">everyman</a> who acts as the film's narrator.

Following the release of the 1976 album, a <a href="film%20adaptation">film adaptation</a> of the musical became mired in <a href="development%20hell">development hell</a> for more than fifteen years, as the rights were passed on to several major studios, and various directors and actors considered. In 1993, producer <a href="Robert%20Stigwood">Robert Stigwood</a> sold the rights to <a href="Andrew%20G.%20Vajna">Andrew G. Vajna</a>, who agreed to finance the film through his production company <a href="Cinergi%20Pictures">Cinergi Pictures</a>, with <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Studios%20%28division%29">the Walt Disney Studios</a> distributing the film through <a href="Hollywood%20Pictures">Hollywood Pictures</a>. After Stone stepped down from the project in 1994, Parker agreed to write and direct the film. Recording sessions for the songs and <a href="Evita%20%28soundtrack%29">soundtrack</a> took place at CTS Studios in London, England, roughly four months before filming. Parker worked with Rice and Lloyd Webber to compose the soundtrack, reworking the original songs by creating the music first and then the lyrics. They also wrote a new song, "<a href="You%20Must%20Love%20Me">You Must Love Me</a>", for the film. <a href="Principal%20photography">Principal photography</a> commenced in February 1996 with a budget of $55 million, and concluded in May of that year. Filming took place on locations in <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a> and <a href="Budapest">Budapest</a>, and on soundstages at <a href="Shepperton%20Studios">Shepperton Studios</a>. The film's production in Argentina was met with controversy, as the cast and crew faced protests over fears that the project would tarnish Eva's image.

"Evita" premiered at the <a href="Shrine%20Auditorium">Shrine Auditorium</a> in Los Angeles, California, on December 14, 1996. Hollywood Pictures gave the film a <a href="Limited%20release%23Platform%20release">platform release</a>, which involved releasing it in select cities before expanding distribution in the following weeks. The film had a <a href="limited%20release">limited release</a> on December 25, 1996, before opening <a href="wide%20release">nationwide</a> on January 10, 1997. It grossed over $141 million worldwide. The film received a mixed critical response; reviewers praised Madonna's performance, the music, costume designs and cinematography, while criticism was aimed at the pacing and direction. "Evita" received many <a href="List%20of%20accolades%20received%20by%20Evita%20%281996%20film%29">awards and nominations</a>, including the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Original%20Song">Academy Award for Best Original Song</a> ("You Must Love Me"), and three <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award">Golden Globe Award</a>s for <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Motion%20Picture%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20Musical%20or%20Comedy">Best Picture – Comedy or Musical</a>, <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Original%20Song">Best Original Song</a> ("You Must Love Me") and <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture%20Comedy%20or%20Musical">Best Actress – Comedy or Musical</a> (Madonna).

In a cinema in <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a> on July 26, 1952, a film is interrupted when news breaks of the death of <a href="Eva%20Per%C3%B3n">Eva Perón</a>, Argentina's <a href="First%20Ladies%20and%20Gentlemen%20of%20Argentina">First Lady</a>, at the age of 33. As the nation goes into public mourning, Ché, a member of the public, marvels at the spectacle and promises to show how Eva did "nothing, for years". The rest of the film follows Eva (born Eva Duarte) from her beginnings as an illegitimate child of a lower-class family to her rise to become First Lady and <a href="Spiritual%20Leader%20of%20the%20Nation%20of%20Argentina">Spiritual Leader of the Nation of Argentina</a>; Ché assumes many different guises throughout Eva's story.

At the age of 15, Eva lives in the provincial town of <a href="Jun%C3%ADn%2C%20Buenos%20Aires">Junín</a>, and longs for a better life in Buenos Aires. She persuades a tango singer, <a href="Agust%C3%ADn%20Magaldi">Agustín Magaldi</a>, with whom she is having an affair, to take her to the city. After Magaldi leaves her, she goes through several relationships with increasingly influential men, becoming a model, actress and radio personality. She meets Colonel <a href="Juan%20Per%C3%B3n">Juan Perón</a> at a fundraiser following the <a href="1944%20San%20Juan%20earthquake">1944 San Juan earthquake</a>. Perón's connection with Eva adds to his populist image, since they are both from the working class. Eva has a radio show during Perón's rise and uses all of her skills to promote him, even when the controlling administration has him jailed in an attempt to stunt his political momentum. The groundswell of support that Eva generates forces the government to release Perón, and he finds the people enamored of him and Eva. Perón wins election to the <a href="President%20of%20Argentina">presidency</a> and marries Eva, who promises that the new government will serve the "<a href="descamisados">descamisados</a>".

At the start of the Perón government, Eva dresses glamorously, enjoying the privileges of being the First Lady. Soon after, she embarks on what is called her "Rainbow Tour" of Europe. While there, she receives a mixed reception. The people of Spain adore her, the people of Italy call her a whore and throw things at her, and <a href="Pope%20Pius%20XII">Pope Pius XII</a> gives her a small, meager gift. Upon returning to Argentina, Eva establishes a foundation to help the poor. The film suggests the <a href="Peronism">Perónists</a> otherwise plunder the public treasury.

Eva is hospitalized and learns that she has terminal cancer. She declines the position of Vice President due to her failing health, and makes one final broadcast to the people of Argentina. She understands that her life was short because she shone like the "brightest fire", and helps Perón prepare to go on without her. A large crowd surrounds the <a href="Casa%20Rosada">Casa Rosada</a> in a candlelight vigil praying for her recovery when the light of her room goes out, signifying her death. At Eva's funeral, Ché is seen at her coffin, marveling at the influence of her brief life. He walks up to her glass coffin, kisses it, and joins the crowd of passing mourners.

Following the release of "<a href="Evita%20%28album%29">Evita</a>" (1976), a <a href="sung-through">sung-through</a> <a href="concept%20album">concept album</a> by <a href="Tim%20Rice">Tim Rice</a> and <a href="Andrew%20Lloyd%20Webber">Andrew Lloyd Webber</a> detailing the life of Eva Perón, director <a href="Alan%20Parker">Alan Parker</a> met with their manager <a href="David%20Land">David Land</a>, asking if Rice and Lloyd Webber had thought of making a film version. He understood that they were more interested in creating a stage version with the album's original lyrics. The original West End theatre production of <a href="Evita%20%28musical%29">"Evita"</a> opened at the <a href="Prince%20Edward%20Theatre">Prince Edward Theatre</a> on June 21, 1978, and closed on February 18, 1986. The subsequent Broadway production opened at the <a href="The%20Broadway%20Theatre">Broadway Theatre</a> on September 25, 1979, and closed on June 26, 1983, after 1,567 performances and 17 previews. <a href="Robert%20Stigwood">Robert Stigwood</a>, producer of the West End production, wanted Parker to direct "Evita" as a film but, after completing work on the musical "<a href="Fame%20%281980%20film%29">Fame</a>" (1980), Parker turned down the opportunity to helm "Evita", telling Stigwood that he "didn't want to do back-to-back musicals".

The <a href="film%20rights">film rights</a> to "Evita" became the subject of a <a href="bidding">bidding</a> war among a host of established <a href="film%20studio">film studio</a>s, including <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a>, <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> and <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a>. Stigwood sold the rights to <a href="EMI%20Films">EMI Films</a> for over $7.5 million. He also discussed the project with <a href="Jon%20Peters">Jon Peters</a>, who promised that he would convince his girlfriend <a href="Barbra%20Streisand">Barbra Streisand</a> to play the lead role if he were allowed to produce. Stigwood turned down the offer, opting to stay involved as the film's sole producer. EMI ultimately dropped the project after merging with <a href="Thorn%20Electrical%20Industries">Thorn Electrical Industries</a> to form <a href="Thorn%20EMI">Thorn EMI</a>, as well as producing several <a href="box%20office%20flop">box office flop</a>s under the banner.

In May 1981, Paramount Pictures acquired the film rights, with Stigwood attached as a producer. Paramount allocated a <a href="production%20budget">budget</a> of $15 million, and the film was scheduled to go into production by year-end. To avoid higher production costs, Stigwood, Rice and Lloyd Webber each agreed to take a smaller salary but a higher percentage of the film's gross. Stigwood hired <a href="Ken%20Russell">Ken Russell</a> to direct the film, based on the success of their previous collaboration, "<a href="Tommy%20%281975%20film%29">Tommy</a>" (1975).

Stigwood and Russell decided to hold auditions with the eight actresses portraying Eva in the musical's worldwide productions, with an undisclosed number performing <a href="screen%20test">screen test</a>s in New York and London. In November 1981, Russell continued holding screen tests at <a href="Elstree%20Studios">Elstree Studios</a>. <a href="Karla%20DeVito">Karla DeVito</a> was among those who auditioned for the role of Eva. Russell also travelled to London, where he screen tested <a href="Liza%20Minnelli">Liza Minnelli</a> wearing a blonde wig and custom-period gowns. He felt that Minnelli, a more established film actress, would be better suited for the role, but Rice, Stigwood and Paramount wanted <a href="Elaine%20Paige">Elaine Paige</a>, the first actress to play Eva in the London stage production. Russell began working on his own screenplay without Stigwood, Rice or Lloyd Webber's approval. His script followed the outlines of the stage production, but established the character of Ché as a newspaper reporter. The script also contained a hospital montage for Eva and Ché, in which they pass each other on <a href="stretcher">gurneys</a> in white corridors as she is being treated for cancer, while Ché is beaten and injured by rioters. Russell was ultimately fired from the project after telling Stigwood he would not do the film without Minnelli.

As Paramount began <a href="location%20scouting">scouting locations</a> in Mexico, Stigwood began the search for a new director. He met with <a href="Herbert%20Ross">Herbert Ross</a>, who declined in favor of directing "<a href="Footloose%20%281984%20film%29">Footloose</a>" (1984) for Paramount. Stigwood then met with <a href="Richard%20Attenborough">Richard Attenborough</a>, who deemed the project impossible. Stigwood also approached directors <a href="Alan%20J.%20Pakula">Alan J. Pakula</a> and <a href="Hector%20Babenco">Hector Babenco</a>, who both declined. In 1986, <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a> visited Stigwood in his office, dressed in a gown and 1940s-style hairdo to show her interest in playing Eva. She also campaigned briefly for <a href="Francis%20Ford%20Coppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a> to helm the film. Stigwood was impressed, stating that she was "perfect" for the part.

In 1987, <a href="Jerry%20Weintraub">Jerry Weintraub</a>'s independent film company <a href="Weintraub%20Entertainment%20Group">Weintraub Entertainment Group</a> (WEG) obtained the film rights from Paramount. <a href="Oliver%20Stone">Oliver Stone</a>, a fan of the musical, expressed interest in the film adaptation and contacted Stigwood's <a href="production%20company">production company</a> <a href="Robert%20Stigwood%23Robert%20Stigwood%20Organisation">RSO Films</a> to discuss the project. After he was confirmed as the film's writer and director in April 1988, Stone travelled to Argentina, where he visited Eva's birthplace and met with the newly elected President <a href="Carlos%20Menem">Carlos Menem</a>, who agreed to provide 50,000 <a href="Extra%20%28acting%29">extras</a> for the production as well as allowing <a href="freedom%20of%20speech">freedom of speech</a>.

Madonna met with Stone and Lloyd Webber in New York to discuss the role. Plans fell through after she requested script approval and told Lloyd Webber that she wanted to rewrite the score. Stone then approached <a href="Meryl%20Streep">Meryl Streep</a> for the lead role and worked closely with her, Rice and Lloyd Webber at a New York City recording studio to do preliminary dubbings of the score. Stigwood said of Streep's musical performance, "She learned the entire score in a week. Not only can she sing, but she's sensational – absolutely staggering."

WEG allocated a budget of $29 million, with filming set to begin in early 1989, but production was halted due to the <a href="1989%20riots%20in%20Argentina">1989 riots in Argentina</a>. Concerned for the safety of the cast and crew, Stigwood and Weintraub decided against shooting there. The filmmakers then scouted locations in Brazil and Chile, before deciding on Spain, with a proposed budget of $35 million; the poor box office performances of WEG's films resulted in the studio dropping the project. Stone took "Evita" to <a href="Carolco%20Pictures">Carolco Pictures</a> shortly after, and Streep remained a front-runner for the lead role. However, Streep began increasing her <a href="ask%20price">asking price</a>; she demanded a <a href="Guarantee%20%28filmmaking%29">pay-or-play contract</a> with a 48-hour deadline. Although an agreement was reached, Streep's agent contacted Carolco and RSO Films, advising them that she was stepping down from the project for "personal reasons". Streep renewed her interest after ten days, but Stone and his creative team had left the project in favor of making "<a href="The%20Doors%20%28film%29">The Doors</a>" (1991).

In 1990, <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Studios%20%28division%29">the Walt Disney Studios</a> acquired the film rights to "Evita", and <a href="Glenn%20Gordon%20Caron">Glenn Gordon Caron</a> was hired to direct the film, with Madonna set to appear in the lead role. Disney was to produce the film under its adult film label <a href="Hollywood%20Pictures">Hollywood Pictures</a>. Although Disney had spent $2–3 million in development costs, it canceled the plans in May 1991 when the budget climbed to $30 million. Disney chairman <a href="Jeffrey%20Katzenberg">Jeffrey Katzenberg</a> did not want to spend more than $25.7 million on the film. In November 1993, Stigwood sold the film rights to <a href="Andrew%20G.%20Vajna">Andrew G. Vajna</a>'s production company <a href="Cinergi%20Pictures">Cinergi Pictures</a>. Vajna later enlisted <a href="Arnon%20Milchan">Arnon Milchan</a> of <a href="Regency%20Enterprises">Regency Enterprises</a> as a co-financier, and Stone returned as the film's director after meeting with Dan Halsted, the senior vice president of Hollywood Pictures. Production was set to begin sometime in 1995 after Stone and Milchan concluded filming of "Noriega", a film chronicling the life of Panamanian general and dictator <a href="Manuel%20Noriega">Manuel Noriega</a>. Stone and Milchan disputed over the high production costs of "Evita", "Noriega" (which was never filmed) and "<a href="Nixon%20%28film%29">Nixon</a>" (1995), resulting in Stone leaving the project in July 1994.

In December 1994, Alan Parker signed on to write and direct the film after being approached by Stigwood and Vajna. Parker also produced the film, with his Dirty Hands Productions banner enlisted as a production company. While drafting his own script, Parker researched Eva's life, compiling newspaper articles, documentaries and English-language books. He refused to borrow elements from Stone's script or the stage play, instead opting to model his script after Rice and Lloyd Webber's concept album. Stone had a falling out with Parker over the content of the script, claiming that he had made significant contributions. A legal dispute and arbitration by the <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America">Writers Guild of America</a> resulted in Parker and Stone sharing a screenwriting credit.
Parker's finished script included 146 changes to the concept album's music and lyrics. In May 1995, he and Rice visited Lloyd Webber at his home in France, where Parker tried to bring them to work on the film. Rice and Lloyd Webber had not worked together for many years, and the script for "Evita" required that they compose new music. In June 1995, with assistance from the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">United States Department of State</a> and <a href="United%20States%20senator">senator</a> <a href="Chris%20Dodd">Chris Dodd</a>, Parker arranged a private meeting with Menem in Argentina to discuss the film's production and request permission to film at the <a href="Casa%20Rosada">Casa Rosada</a>, the executive mansion. Although he expressed his discontent with the production, Menem granted the filmmakers creative freedom to shoot in Argentina, but not in the Casa Rosada. He also advised Parker to be prepared to face protests against the film. Parker had the film's <a href="production%20designer">production designer</a> <a href="Brian%20Morris%20%28art%20director%29">Brian Morris</a> take photographs of the Casa Rosada, so that the production could construct a replica at <a href="Shepperton%20Studios">Shepperton Studios</a> in England. The director visited seven other countries before deciding to film on location in Buenos Aires and <a href="Budapest">Budapest</a>.

<a href="Antonio%20Banderas">Antonio Banderas</a> was the first actor to secure a role in the film. He was cast as Ché when Glenn Gordon Caron was hired to direct the film, and remained involved when Stone returned to the project. Before he left the project, Stone had considered casting <a href="Michelle%20Pfeiffer">Michelle Pfeiffer</a> in the lead role of Eva, and this was confirmed in July 1994. Pfeiffer left the production when she became pregnant with her second child. Parker also considered <a href="Glenn%20Close">Glenn Close</a>, along with Streep, to play Eva.

In December 1994, Madonna sent Parker a four-page letter explaining that she was the best person to portray Eva and would be fully committed to the role. She also sent him a copy of her "<a href="Take%20a%20Bow%20%28Madonna%20song%29">Take a Bow</a>" music video as a way of "auditioning". Parker insisted that if Madonna was to be his Evita, she must understand who was in charge. "The film is not a glorified Madonna video," said Parker. "I controlled it and she didn't." Rice believed that Madonna suited the title role since she could "act so beautifully through music". Lloyd Webber was wary about her singing. Since the film required the actors to sing their own parts, Madonna underwent vocal training with coach Joan Lader to increase her own confidence in singing the unusual songs, and project her voice in a much more cohesive manner. Lader noted that the singer "had to use her voice in a way she's never used it before. "Evita" is real musical theater — it's operatic, in a sense. Madonna developed an upper <a href="register%20%28music%29">register</a> that she didn't know she had."

In January 1996, Madonna travelled to Buenos Aires to research Eva's life, and met with several people who had known her before her death. During filming, she fell sick many times due to the intense emotional effort required, and midway through production, she discovered she was pregnant. Her daughter Lourdes was born on October 14, 1996. Madonna published a diary of the film shoot in "<a href="Vanity%20Fair%20%28magazine%29">Vanity Fair</a>". She said of the experience, "This is the role I was born to play. I put everything of me into this because it was much more than a role in a movie. It was exhilarating and intimidating at the same time ... And I am prouder of "Evita" than anything else I have done."

Parker decided to keep Banderas in the supporting role of Ché after checking the actor's audition tape. While writing the script, the director chose not to reveal the character as <a href="Che%20Guevara">Ernesto "Che" Guevara</a>, which had been done in several versions of the musical. "In the movie Ché tells the story of Eva", Banderas said. "He takes a very critical view of her and he's sometimes cynical and aggressive but funny, too. At the same time he creates this problem for himself because, for all his principles, he gets struck by the charm of the woman." For the role of <a href="Juan%20Per%C3%B3n">Juan Perón</a>, Parker approached film and stage actor <a href="Jonathan%20Pryce">Jonathan Pryce</a>, who secured the part after meeting with the director.

The film's production in Argentina was met with controversy and sparked significant media attention. The cast and crew faced protests over fears that the project would tarnish Eva's image. Members of the <a href="Peronism">Peronist Party</a> launched a hate campaign, condemning the film's production, Madonna and Parker. "Evita" also prompted the <a href="Government%20of%20Argentina">Government of Argentina</a> to produce their own film, "" (1996), to counter any misconceptions or inaccuracies caused by the film. In response to the controversy surrounding the project, the production held a press conference in Buenos Aires on February 6, 1996.

<a href="Principal%20photography">Principal photography</a> began on February 8, 1996, with a budget of $55 million. Production designer Brian Morris constructed 320 different sets. <a href="Costume%20design">Costume design</a>er <a href="Penny%20Rose">Penny Rose</a> was given special access to Eva's wardrobe in Argentina, and she modeled her own costume designs after Eva's original outfits and shoes. She clothed 40,000 extras in period dresses. The production used more than 5,500 costumes from 20 costume houses located in Paris, Rome, London, New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Buenos Aires, and Budapest as well as 1,000 military uniforms. Madonna's wardrobe included 85 costume changes, 39 hats, 45 pairs of shoes, and 56 pairs of earrings. She broke the <a href="Guinness%20World%20Records">Guinness World Record</a> for "Most Costume Changes in a Film".

Filming began in Buenos Aires with scenes depicting Eva's childhood in 1936. Locations included <a href="Los%20Toldos">Los Toldos</a>, the town of <a href="Jun%C3%ADn%2C%20Buenos%20Aires">Junín</a>, where Eva was raised, and <a href="Chivilcoy">Chivilcoy</a>, where her father's funeral was held. On February 23, 1996, Menem arranged a meeting with Parker, Madonna, Pryce and Banderas, and granted the crew permission to film in the Casa Rosada shortly before they were scheduled to leave Buenos Aires. On March 9, the production filmed the musical number "<a href="Don%27t%20Cry%20for%20Me%20Argentina">Don't Cry for Me Argentina</a>" there, utilizing 4,000 extras for two days. Filming in Buenos Aires concluded after five weeks.

The cast and crew then moved to Budapest, Hungary, where 23 locations were used for scenes set in Buenos Aires. The production spent two days re-enacting Eva's <a href="state%20funeral">state funeral</a>, which required 4,000 extras to act as citizens, police officials and military personnel. The filmmakers shot exterior scenes outside of the <a href="St.%20Stephen%27s%20Basilica">St. Stephen's Basilica</a>, but were denied access to film inside the building. For the musical numbers "Your Little Body's Slowly Breaking Down" and "Lament", Parker had Madonna and Pryce record the songs live on set, due to the emotional effort required from their performances. After five weeks of shooting in Hungary, the remainder of filming took place on <a href="sound%20stage">sound stage</a>s at Shepperton Studios in England. Principal photography concluded on May 30, 1996, after 84 days of filming.

<a href="Cinematographer">Director of photography</a> <a href="Darius%20Khondji">Darius Khondji</a> was initially reluctant about working on a musical but was inspired by Parker's passion for the project. For the film's visual style, Khondji and Parker were influenced by the works of <a href="American%20realism">American realist</a> painter <a href="George%20Bellows">George Bellows</a>. Khondji shot "Evita" using <a href="Moviecam">Moviecam</a> cameras, with <a href="Cooke%20Optics">Cooke</a> anamorphic lenses. He used Eastman <a href="List%20of%20motion%20picture%20film%20stocks%23EXR%20color%20negative%20%28ECN-2%20process%201989%E2%80%931996%29">EXR 5245</a> <a href="film%20stock">film stock</a> for exteriors in Argentina, 5293 for the Argentinean interiors, and 5248 for any scenes shot during overcast days and combat sequences.

Khondji employed large <a href="Incandescent%20light%20bulb">tungsten lighting</a> units, including 18K <a href="Hydrargyrum%20medium-arc%20iodide%20lamp">HMIs</a>, dino and Wendy lights. He used <a href="Arri">Arri</a>flex's VariCon, which functions as an illuminated <a href="Photographic%20filter">filter</a>, and incorporated much more lens filtration than he had on previous projects. <a href="Technicolor">Technicolor</a>'s ENR <a href="bleach%20bypass">silver retention</a>, when combined with the VariCon, was used to control the <a href="Contrast%20%28vision%29">contrast</a> and black density of the film's <a href="release%20print">release print</a>s. The finished film features 299 scenes and 3,000 shots from of film.

Recording sessions for the film's songs and soundtrack began on October 2, 1995, at CTS Studios in London. It took almost four months to record all the songs, which involved creating the music first and then the lyrics. Parker declared the first day of recording as "Black Monday", and recalled it as a worrisome and nervous day. He said, "All of us came from very different worlds—from popular music, from movies, and from musical theater—and so we were all very apprehensive." The cast was also nervous; Banderas found the experience "scary", while Madonna was "petrified" when it came to recording the songs. "I had to sing 'Don't Cry For Me Argentina' in front of Andrew Lloyd Webber ... I was a complete mess and was sobbing afterward. I thought I had done a terrible job", the singer recalled.

According to the film's music producer <a href="Nigel%20Wright%20%28record%20producer%29">Nigel Wright</a>, the lead actors would first sing the numbers backed by a band and orchestra before working with Parker and <a href="music%20supervisor">music supervisor</a> David Caddick "in a more intimate recording environment [to] perfect their vocals". More trouble arose as Madonna was not completely comfortable with "laying down a guide vocal simultaneously with an 84-piece orchestra" in the studio. She was used to singing over a pre-recorded track and not having musicians listen to her. Also, unlike her previous soundtrack releases, she had little to no creative control. "I'm used to writing my own songs and I go into a studio, choose the musicians and say what sounds good or doesn't ... To work on 46 songs with everyone involved and not have a big say was a big adjustment," she recalled. An emergency meeting was held between Parker, Lloyd Webber and Madonna, where it was decided that the singer would record her part at Whitfield Street Studios, a contemporary studio, while the orchestration would take place elsewhere. She also had alternate days off from the recording to preserve and strengthen her voice.

By the end of recording, Parker noticed that Rice and Lloyd Webber did not have a new song in place. They arranged a meeting at Lloyd Webber's county estate in <a href="Berkshire">Berkshire</a>, where they began work on the music and lyrics for "<a href="You%20Must%20Love%20Me">You Must Love Me</a>". Madonna's reaction to the lyrics was negative since she wanted Eva to be portrayed sympathetically, rather than as the "shrewd manipulator" that Parker had in mind. Although Madonna was successful in getting many portions in the script altered, Rice declined to change the song. He recalled, "I remember taking the lyrics to Madonna and she was trying to change them... The scene can be interpreted in different ways, but my lyrics were kept, thank God!"

The soundtrack for "Evita" was released in the United States on November 12, 1996. <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Records">Warner Bros. Records</a> released two versions: a two-disc edition entitled "Evita: The Complete Motion Picture Music Soundtrack", which featured all the tracks from the film, and "Evita: Music from the Motion Picture", a single-disc edition. <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>'s <a href="Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine</a> described the soundtrack as "unengaging", while "<a href="Hartford%20Courant">Hartford Courant</a>"s Greg Morago praised Madonna's singing abilities. The soundtrack was a commercial success, reaching the top of the charts in Austria, Belgium, Scotland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. According to Carol Clerk's book "Madonna Style", the soundtrack has sold 11 million copies worldwide.

In May 1996, Parker constructed a 10-minute <a href="Trailer%20%28promotion%29">trailer</a> of "Evita" that was shown at the <a href="1996%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">1996 Cannes Film Festival</a> for reporters, film distributors and critics. Despite a minor technical issue with the film projector's synchronization of the sound and picture, the trailer received positive response. <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a>, writing for the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>", said, "If the preview is representative of the finished film, Argentina can wipe away its tears." Barry Walters of "<a href="The%20San%20Francisco%20Examiner">The San Francisco Examiner</a>" stated, "Rather than showing the best moments from every scene, the trailer concentrates on a few that prove what Madonna, Banderas and Pryce can do musically. The results are impressive." "Evita" premiered at the <a href="Shrine%20Auditorium">Shrine Auditorium</a> in Los Angeles on December 14, 1996, the <a href="Savoy%20Cinema">Savoy Cinema</a> in Dublin, Ireland, on December 19, 1996, and the <a href="Empire%2C%20Leicester%20Square">Empire Theatre</a> in <a href="Leicester%20Square">Leicester Square</a>, London, on December 20, 1996.

Hollywood Pictures gave the film a <a href="Limited%20release%23Platform%20release">platform release</a>, showing it in a few cities before expanding distribution in the following weeks. "Evita" opened in <a href="limited%20release">limited release</a> in New York and Los Angeles on December 25, 1996, before being released <a href="wide%20release">nationwide</a> on January 10, 1997. The film was distributed by <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Studios%20Motion%20Pictures">Buena Vista Pictures</a> in North America and Latin America, <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> (through <a href="United%20International%20Pictures">United International Pictures</a>) in Germany and Japan, and <a href="Summit%20Entertainment">Summit Entertainment</a> in other countries. A book detailing the film's production, "The Making of Evita", was written by Parker and released on December 10, 1996, by <a href="HarperCollins">Collins Publishers</a>. In 2002, "Evita" became the first and only American film to be screened at the <a href="Pyongyang%20International%20Film%20Festival">Pyongyang International Film Festival</a>.

"Evita" saw a small increase in attendance in its <a href="Second%20weekend%20in%20box%20office%20performance">second weekend</a> of wide release. During the four-day <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.%20Day">Martin Luther King Jr. Day</a> weekend, the film moved to third place on domestic box office charts, and earned $8,918,183—a 6.4% overall increase from the previous weekend.

The film received a mixed response from critics. The <a href="Review%20aggregator">review aggregation</a> website <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> sampled 38 reviews, and gave the film a score of 63%, with an <a href="Weighted%20arithmetic%20mean">average</a> score of 6.7 out of 10. Another review aggregator, <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, assigned the film a <a href="weighted%20mean">weighted average</a> score of 45 out of 100 based on 23 reviews from critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". Audiences polled by <a href="CinemaScore">CinemaScore</a> gave the film an average grade of "A-" on an A+ to F scale.

Writing for the "<a href="Hartford%20Courant">Hartford Courant</a>", Malcolm Johnson stated, "Against all odds, this long-delayed film version turns out to be a labor of love for director Alan Parker and for his stars, the reborn Madonna, the new superstar Antonio Banderas, the protean veteran Jonathan Pryce." <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> of the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>" gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, writing "Parker's visuals enliven the music, and Madonna and Banderas bring it passion. By the end of the film we feel like we've had our money's worth, and we're sure Evita has." On the syndicated television program "<a href="At%20the%20Movies%20%281986%20TV%20program%29">Siskel & Ebert & the Movies</a>", Ebert and his colleague <a href="Gene%20Siskel">Gene Siskel</a> gave the film a "two thumbs up" rating. Siskel, in his review for the "Chicago Tribune", wrote, "Director Alan Parker has mounted this production well, which is more successful as spectacle than anything else." According to "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine's <a href="Richard%20Corliss">Richard Corliss</a>, "This "Evita" is not just a long, complex music video; it works and breathes like a real movie, with characters worthy of our affection and deepest suspicions." Critic Zach Conner commented, "It's a relief to say that "Evita" is pretty damn fine, well-cast, and handsomely visualized. Madonna once again confounds our expectations. She plays Evita with a poignant weariness and has more than just a bit of star quality. Love or hate Madonna-Eva, she is a magnet for all eyes."

Carol Buckland of <a href="CNN">CNN</a> considered that ""Evita" is basically a music video with epic pretensions. This is not to say it isn't gorgeous to look at or occasionally extremely entertaining. It's both of those things. But for all the movie's grand style, it falls short in terms of substance and soul."

Giving the film a C- rating, <a href="Owen%20Gleiberman">Owen Gleiberman</a> of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" criticized Parker's direction, stating, ""Evita" could have worked had it been staged as larger-than-life spectacle ... The way Alan Parker has directed "Evita", however, it's just a sluggish, contradictory mess, a drably "realistic" Latin-revolution music video driven by a soundtrack of mediocre '70s rock." <a href="Janet%20Maslin">Janet Maslin</a> from "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" praised Madonna's performance as well as the costume design and cinematography, but wrote that the film was "breathless and shrill, since Alan Parker's direction shows no signs of a moral or political compass and remains in exhausting overdrive all the time." Jane Horwitz of the "<a href="Sun-Sentinel">Sun-Sentinel</a>" stated, "Madonna sings convincingly and gets through the acting, but her performance lacks depth, grace and muscle. Luckily, director Alan Parker's historic-looking production with its epic crowd scenes and sepia-toned newsreels shows her off well." Negative criticism came from the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>"s Barbara Shulgasser, who wrote: "This movie is supposed to be about politics and liberation, the triumph of the lower classes over oppression, about corruption. But it is so steeped in spectacle, in Madonna-ness, in bad rock music and simple-minded ideas, that in the end it isn't about anything".

"Evita" received various awards and nominations, with particular recognition for Madonna, Parker, Rice, Lloyd Webber and the song "You Must Love Me". It received five <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award">Golden Globe Award</a> nominations, and won three for <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Motion%20Picture%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20Musical%20or%20Comedy">Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy</a>, <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture%20Comedy%20or%20Musical">Best Actress – Musical or Comedy</a> (Madonna) and <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Original%20Song">Best Original Song</a> ("You Must Love Me").

Zodiac (film)

Zodiac is a 2007 American <a href="thriller%20film">thriller film</a> directed by <a href="David%20Fincher">David Fincher</a>. The screenplay by <a href="James%20Vanderbilt">James Vanderbilt</a> is based on the <a href="Zodiac%20%28true%20crime%20book%29">1986 non-fiction book of the same name</a> by <a href="Robert%20Graysmith">Robert Graysmith</a>. The film stars <a href="Jake%20Gyllenhaal">Jake Gyllenhaal</a>, <a href="Mark%20Ruffalo">Mark Ruffalo</a>, and <a href="Robert%20Downey%2C%20Jr.">Robert Downey, Jr.</a>, with <a href="Anthony%20Edwards">Anthony Edwards</a>, <a href="Brian%20Cox%20%28actor%29">Brian Cox</a>, <a href="Elias%20Koteas">Elias Koteas</a>, <a href="Donal%20Logue">Donal Logue</a>, <a href="John%20Carroll%20Lynch">John Carroll Lynch</a>, <a href="Dermot%20Mulroney">Dermot Mulroney</a>, and <a href="Chlo%C3%AB%20Sevigny">Chloë Sevigny</a> in supporting roles.

"Zodiac" tells the story of the <a href="Manhunt%20%28Law%20Enforcement%29">manhunt</a> for the <a href="Zodiac%20Killer">Zodiac Killer</a>, a <a href="serial%20killer">serial killer</a> who called himself the "Zodiac" and killed in and around the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay%20Area">San Francisco Bay Area</a> during the late 1960s and early 1970s, taunting police with letters, bloodstained clothing, and <a href="cipher">cipher</a>s mailed to newspapers. The cases remain one of the United States' most infamous unsolved crimes.

Fincher, Vanderbilt, and producer <a href="Bradley%20J.%20Fischer">Bradley J. Fischer</a> spent 18 months conducting their own investigation and research into the Zodiac murders. Fincher employed the digital <a href="Viper%20FilmStream%20High-Definition%20Camera">Thomson Viper</a> Filmstream camera to photograph most of the film with traditional high-speed film cameras used for slow-motion murder sequences.

Reviews for "Zodiac" were positive, lauding the film's writing, directing, acting and historical authenticity. "Zodiac" was nominated for several awards and Fincher won the "Best Director" prize from the <a href="Dublin%20Film%20Critics%27%20Circle">Dublin Film Critics' Circle</a> in 2007. The film grossed over $84 million worldwide on a production budget of $65 million. In 2016 it was voted 12th among 100 films considered the <a href="BBC%27s%20100%20Greatest%20Films%20of%20the%2021st%20Century">best of the 21st century</a> by 117 film critics from around the world.

On July 4, 1969, an unknown man attacks Darlene Ferrin and Mike Mageau with a handgun at a lovers' lane in <a href="Vallejo%2C%20California">Vallejo, California</a>. Mageau survives.

One month later, the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" receives <a href="encrypted">encrypted</a> letters written by the killer calling himself the "<a href="Zodiac%20Killer">Zodiac</a>" and taunting the police. Political cartoonist <a href="Robert%20Graysmith">Robert Graysmith</a> is not taken seriously by crime reporter <a href="Paul%20Avery">Paul Avery</a> or the editors and is excluded from the initial details about the killings. When the newspaper publishes the letters, a married couple deciphers one. In September, the killer attacks law student Bryan Hartnell and Cecelia Shepard at <a href="Lake%20Berryessa">Lake Berryessa</a> in <a href="Napa%20County">Napa County</a>; Shepard dies two days later.

At a bar, Avery makes fun of Graysmith before they discuss the coded letters. Graysmith interprets the letter, which Avery finds helpful, and Avery begins sharing information. One of Graysmith's insights about the letters is that the Zodiac's reference to man as "the most dangerous animal of them all" is a reference to the film "<a href="The%20Most%20Dangerous%20Game">The Most Dangerous Game</a>," which features General Zaroff as a man who hunts live human prey.

Two weeks later, San Francisco taxicab driver Paul Stine is shot and killed in the city's <a href="Presidio%20Heights">Presidio Heights</a> district. The Zodiac killer mails pieces of Stine's bloodstained shirt to the "Chronicle" along with a taunting letter. San Francisco police inspectors <a href="Dave%20Toschi">Dave Toschi</a> and his partner Bill Armstrong are assigned to the case by Captain Marty Lee, and work closely with Vallejo's Jack Mulanax and Captain Ken Narlow in Napa. Someone claiming to be Zodiac continues to send taunting letters and speaks on the phone with lawyer <a href="Melvin%20Belli">Melvin Belli</a> on a television talk show.

In 1971, Detectives Toschi, Armstrong, and Mulanax question Arthur Leigh Allen, a suspect in the Vallejo case. They notice that he wears a <a href="Zodiac%20Watches">Zodiac wristwatch</a>, with the same logo used by the killer. However, a <a href="Questioned%20document%20examination">handwriting expert</a> insists that Allen did not write the Zodiac letters, even though Allen is said to be <a href="ambidextrous">ambidextrous</a>. Avery receives a letter threatening his life; becoming paranoid, he turns to drugs and alcohol. He shares information with the <a href="Riverside%20Police%20Department">Riverside Police Department</a>, angering Toschi and Armstrong. The case's notoriety weighs on Toschi, who is unable to sit through a Hollywood film, "<a href="Dirty%20Harry">Dirty Harry</a>", loosely based on the Zodiac case.

In 1978, Avery moves to the "<a href="Sacramento%20Bee">Sacramento Bee</a>". Graysmith persistently contacts Toschi about the Zodiac murders, and eventually impresses him with his knowledge of the case. While Toschi cannot directly give Graysmith access to the evidence, he provides names in other police departments where Zodiac murders occurred. Armstrong transfers from the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Police%20Department">San Francisco Police</a> homicide division and Toschi is demoted for supposedly forging a Zodiac letter.

Graysmith continues his own investigation, profiled in the "Chronicle", and gives a television interview about the book he is writing about the case. He begins receiving phone calls with heavy breathing. As his obsession deepens, Graysmith loses his job and his wife Melanie leaves him, taking their children. Graysmith learns that Allen lived close to Ferrin and probably knew her and that his birthday matches the one Zodiac gave when he spoke to one of Belli's maids. While <a href="circumstantial%20evidence">circumstantial evidence</a> seems to indicate his guilt, the physical evidence, such as fingerprints and handwriting samples, do not implicate him. In December 1983, Graysmith tracks Allen to a Vallejo <a href="Ace%20Hardware">Ace Hardware</a> store, where he is employed as a sales clerk; Graysmith stares at him. Eight years later, after Graysmith's book "<a href="Zodiac%20%28true%20crime%20book%29">Zodiac</a>" has become a bestseller, Mageau identifies Allen from a <a href="Mug%20book">police mugshot</a>.

<a href="James%20Vanderbilt">James Vanderbilt</a> had read <a href="Robert%20Graysmith">Robert Graysmith</a>'s book "<a href="Zodiac%20%28book%29">Zodiac</a>" in 1986 while in high school. Years later, after becoming a <a href="screenwriter">screenwriter</a>, he got the opportunity to meet Graysmith, and became fascinated by the folklore surrounding the Zodiac killer. He decided to try to translate the story into a script. Vanderbilt had endured bad experiences in the past in which the endings of his scripts had been changed, and wanted to have more control over the material this time. He pitched his adaptation of "Zodiac" to <a href="Mike%20Medavoy">Mike Medavoy</a> and Bradley J. Fischer from <a href="Phoenix%20Pictures">Phoenix Pictures</a>, agreeing to write a <a href="spec%20script">spec script</a> if he could have more creative control over it.

Graysmith met Fischer and Vanderbilt at the premiere of <a href="Paul%20Schrader">Paul Schrader</a>'s film "<a href="Auto%20Focus">Auto Focus</a>," based on Graysmith's 1991 book about the life and death of actor <a href="Bob%20Crane">Bob Crane</a>. A deal was made and they optioned the rights to "Zodiac" and "Zodiac Unmasked" when they became available after languishing at another studio for nearly a decade. <a href="David%20Fincher">David Fincher</a> was their first choice to direct based on his work on "<a href="Seven%20%281995%20film%29">Seven</a>". Originally, he was going to direct an adaptation of <a href="James%20Ellroy">James Ellroy</a>'s novel "<a href="The%20Black%20Dahlia%20%28novel%29">The Black Dahlia</a>" (later filmed by <a href="Brian%20De%20Palma">Brian De Palma</a>), and envisioned a five-hour, $80 million mini-series with film stars. When that fell through, Fincher left that project and moved on to "Zodiac".

Fincher was drawn to the Zodiac story because he spent much of his childhood in <a href="San%20Anselmo">San Anselmo</a> in <a href="Marin%20County">Marin County</a> during the initial murders. "I remember coming home and saying the highway patrol had been following our school buses for a couple weeks now. And my dad, who worked from home, and who was very dry, not one to soft-pedal things, turned slowly in his chair and said: 'Oh yeah. There's a serial killer who has killed four or five people, who calls himself Zodiac, who's threatened to take a high-powered rifle and shoot out the tires of a school bus, and then shoot the children as they come off the bus. For the young Fincher, the killer "was the ultimate boogeyman". The director was also drawn to the unresolved ending of Vanderbilt's screenplay because it felt true to real life, as cases are not always solved.

Fincher felt his job was to dispel the mythic stature the case had taken on over the years by clearly defining what was fact and what was fiction. He told Vanderbilt that he wanted the screenplay rewritten with research done from the original police reports. Fincher found that there was a lot of speculation and <a href="hearsay%20in%20United%20States%20law">hearsay</a> and wanted to interview people directly involved in the case in person to see if he believed what they were telling him. Fincher did this because he felt a burden of responsibility in making a film that convicted someone posthumously.

Fincher, Fischer and Vanderbilt spent months interviewing witnesses, family members of suspects, retired and current investigators, the two surviving victims, and the mayors of San Francisco and Vallejo. Fincher said, "Even when we did our own interviews, we would talk to two people. One would confirm some aspects of it and another would deny it. Plus, so much time had passed, memories are affected and the different telling of the stories would change perception. So when there was any doubt we always went with the police reports." During the course of their research, Fincher and Fischer hired Gerald McMenamin, a <a href="forensic%20linguistics">forensic linguistics</a> expert and professor of linguistics at <a href="California%20State%20University%20Fresno">California State University Fresno</a>, to analyze the Zodiac's letters. Unlike document examiners in the 1970s, he focused on the language of the Zodiac and how he formed his sentences in terms of structure and spelling.

Fincher and Fischer approached <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> to finance the film but talks fell through because the studio wanted the running time fixed at two hours and fifteen minutes. <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> and <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> agreed to share the production costs and were more flexible about the running time. The executives were concerned about the large amount of dialogue, lack of action scenes, and inconclusive ending.

When Dave Toschi met Fincher, Fischer and Vanderbilt, Fincher told him that he was not going to make another "<a href="Dirty%20Harry">Dirty Harry</a>" (which is loosely based on the Zodiac case). Toschi was impressed with their knowledge of the case and realized that he had learned from them. Toschi watched "Zodiac" several times and said "I thought Ruffalo did a good job," but also that the film reminded him of old frustrations that the case was never closed. The Zodiac's surviving victims, Mike Mageau and Bryan Hartnell, were consultants on the film.

<a href="Alan%20J.%20Pakula">Alan J. Pakula</a>'s film "<a href="All%20the%20President%27s%20Men%20%28film%29">All the President's Men</a>" was the template for "Zodiac" as Fincher felt that it was also "the story of a reporter determined to get the story at any cost and one who was new to being an investigative reporter. It was all about his obsession to know the truth." Like in that film, he did not want to spend time telling the back story of any of the characters, focusing, instead, on what they did in regards to the case."

Vanderbilt was drawn to the notion that Graysmith went from a cartoonist to one of the most significant investigators of the case. He pitched the story as: "What if <a href="Garry%20Trudeau">Garry Trudeau</a> woke up one morning and tried to solve the <a href="Son%20of%20Sam">Son of Sam</a>"? As he worked on the script, he became friends with Graysmith. The filmmakers secured the cooperation of the Vallejo Police Department (one of the key investigators at the time) because they hoped that the film would inspire someone to come forward with information that might help solve the cold case.

One of Fincher's earliest conversations on the film's casting was with the actress <a href="Jennifer%20Aniston">Jennifer Aniston</a>. She was talking about actors she had worked with who she loved, and two of her favorites were Gyllenhaal ("<a href="The%20Good%20Girl">The Good Girl</a>") and Mark Ruffalo ("<a href="Rumor%20Has%20It%20%28film%29">Rumor Has It</a>"). While researching the film, Fincher considered <a href="Jake%20Gyllenhaal">Jake Gyllenhaal</a> to play <a href="Robert%20Graysmith">Robert Graysmith</a>. According to the director, "I really liked him in "<a href="Donnie%20Darko">Donnie Darko</a>" and I thought, 'He's an interesting double-sided coin. He can do that naive thing but he can also do possessed.'" In preparation for his role Gyllenhaal met Graysmith, and videotaped him to study his mannerisms and behavior.

Initially, <a href="Mark%20Ruffalo">Mark Ruffalo</a> was not interested in the project but Fincher wanted him to play <a href="David%20Toschi">David Toschi</a>. He met with the actor and told him that he was rewriting the screenplay. "I loved what he was saying and loved where he was going with it", the actor remembers. For research, he read every report on the case and read all the books on the subject. Ruffalo met Toschi and found out that he had "perfect recall of the details and what happened when, where, who was there, what he was wearing. He always knew what he was wearing. I think it is seared into who he is and it was a big deal for him."

Fincher said he thought of <a href="Anthony%20Edwards">Anthony Edwards</a> for the role of Inspector William Armstrong because "I knew I needed the most decent person I could find, because he would be the balance of the movie. In a weird way, this movie wouldn't exist without Bill Armstrong. Everything we know about the Zodiac case, we know because of his notes. So in casting the part, I wanted to get someone who is totally reliable."

Originally, <a href="Gary%20Oldman">Gary Oldman</a> was to play <a href="Melvin%20Belli">Melvin Belli</a> but "he went to a lot of trouble, they had appliances, but just physically it wasn't going to work, he just didn't have the girth", Graysmith said. <a href="Brian%20Cox%20%28actor%29">Brian Cox</a> was cast instead. <a href="Lee%20Norris">Lee Norris</a> played the 1969 Mike Mageau, and <a href="Jimmi%20Simpson">Jimmi Simpson</a> played the character's older version.

Fincher decided to use the digital <a href="Viper%20FilmStream%20High-Definition%20Camera">Thomson Viper</a> Filmstream camera to shoot the film. Fincher had previously used the Thomson Viper over the past three years on commercials for <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a>, <a href="Hewlett%20Packard">Hewlett Packard</a>, <a href="Heineken">Heineken</a> and <a href="Lexus">Lexus</a> which allowed him to get used to and experiment with the equipment. He was able to use inexpensive desktop software like <a href="Final%20Cut%20Pro">Final Cut Pro</a> to edit "Zodiac". Fincher remarked in an interview, "<a href="Dailies">Dailies</a> almost always end up being disappointing, like the veil is pierced and you look at it for the first time and think, 'Oh my god, this is what I really have to work with.' But when you can see what you have as it's gathered, it can be a much less neurotic process."

"Zodiac" was the first production to employ the Filmstream camera in its native Filmstream mode, which records an <a href="uncompressed%20video">uncompressed video</a> stream, allowing for exceptional quality.

Contrary to popular belief, "Zodiac" was not shot entirely digitally; traditional high-speed film cameras were used for slow-motion murder sequences. <a href="Michael%20Mann%20%28film%20director%29">Michael Mann's</a> "<a href="Miami%20Vice%20%28film%29">Miami Vice</a>", as well as his previous effort, "<a href="Collateral%20%28film%29">Collateral</a>" (a co-production of Paramount and its current sister studio <a href="DreamWorks">DreamWorks</a>, and which also starred Mark Ruffalo), were also shot with the camera but mixed in other formats. Once shot on the Viper camera, the files were converted to DVCPro HD 1080i and edited in <a href="Final%20Cut%20Pro">Final Cut Pro</a>. This was for editorial decisions only. During the later stages of editing the original uncompressed 1080p 4:4:4 RAW digital source footage was assembled automatically to maintain an up-to-date digital "negative" of the film. Other digital productions like "<a href="Superman%20Returns">Superman Returns</a>" or "<a href="Apocalypto">Apocalypto</a>" recorded to the <a href="HDCAM">HDCAM</a> tape format.

Fincher had previously worked with <a href="Cinematographer">director of photography</a> <a href="Harris%20Savides">Harris Savides</a> on "<a href="Seven%20%281995%20film%29">Seven</a>" (he shot the <a href="opening%20credits">opening credits</a>) and "<a href="The%20Game%20%281997%20film%29">The Game</a>". Savides loved the script but realized, "there was so much exposition, just people talking on the phone or having conversations. It was difficult to imagine how it could be done in a visual way." Fincher and Savides did not want to repeat the look of "<a href="Seven%20%281995%20film%29">Seven</a>". The director's approach to "Zodiac" was to create a look mundane enough that audiences would accept that what they were watching was the truth. The filmmakers also did not want to glamorize the killer or tell the story through his eyes. "That would have turned the story into a first-person-shooter video game. We didn't want to make the sort of movie that serial killers would want to own," Fincher said.

Savides' first experience with the Viper Filmstream camera was shooting a <a href="Motorola">Motorola</a> commercial with Fincher. From there, he used it on "Zodiac". Fincher wanted to make sure that the camera was more inclined towards film production so that the studio would be more comfortable about using it on a project with a large budget. To familiarize himself with the camera, he "did as many things 'wrong' as I possibly could. I went against everything I was supposed to do with the camera." Savides felt comfortable with the camera after discovering its limitations.

Fincher and Savides used the photographs of <a href="William%20Eggleston">William Eggleston</a>, <a href="Stephen%20Shore">Stephen Shore</a>'s work from the early Seventies, and actual photos from the Zodiac police files. The two men worked hard to capture the look and feel of the period as Fincher admitted, "I suppose there could have been more <a href="Volkswagen%20Beetle">VW bugs</a> but I think what we show is a pretty good representation of the time. It is not technically perfect. There are some flaws but some are intended." The "San Francisco Chronicle" was built in the old post office in the <a href="U.S.%20Post%20Office%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20Los%20Angeles%20Terminal%20Annex">Terminal Annex Building</a> in downtown <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. A building on nearby Spring Street subbed for the Hall of Justice and the San Francisco Police Department. Production began on September 12, 2005. The filmmakers shot for five weeks in the San Francisco Bay Area and the rest of the time in Los Angeles, bringing the film in under budget, wrapping in February 2006. The film took 115 days to shoot.

Some of the cast was not happy with Fincher's exacting ways and perfectionism. Some scenes required upwards of 70 takes. Gyllenhaal was frustrated by the director's methods and commented in an interview, "You get a take, 5 takes, 10 takes. Some places, 90 takes. But there is a stopping point. There's a point at which you go, 'That's what we have to work with.' But we would reshoot things. So there came a point where I would say, well, what do I do? Where's the risk?" Downey said, "I just decided, aside from several times I wanted to <a href="garrote">garrote</a> him, that I was going to give him what he wanted. I think I'm a perfect person to work for him, because I understand <a href="gulag">gulag</a>s". Fincher responded, "If an actor is going to let the role come to them, they can't resent the fact that I'm willing to wait as long as that takes. You know, the first day of production in San Francisco we shot 56 takes of Mark and Jake – and it's the 56th take that's in the movie". Ruffalo also backed up his director's methods when he said, "The way I see it is, you enter into someone else's world as an actor. You can put your expectations aside and have an experience that's new and pushes and changes you, or hold on to what you think it should be and have a stubborn, immovable journey that's filled with disappointment and anger."

<a href="Digital%20Domain">Digital Domain</a> handled the bulk of the film's 200+ effects shots, including pools of blood and bloody fingerprints found at crime scenes. For the murder of Cecelia Shepard that took place at Lake Berryessa, blood seepage and clothing stains were added in post-production. Fincher did not want to shoot the blood with practical effects because wiping everything down after every take would take too long so the murder sequences were done with CG blood.

CG was also used to recreate the San Francisco neighborhood at Washington and Cherry Streets where cab driver Paul Stine was killed. The area had changed significantly over the years and residents did not want the murder to be recreated in their neighborhood, so Fincher shot the sequence on a bluescreen stage. Production designer Donald Burt gave the visual effects team detailed drawings of the intersection as it was in 1969. Photographs of every possible angle of the area were shot with a high-resolution digital camera, allowing the effects crew to build computer-based geometric models of homes that were then textured with period facades. 3D vintage police motorcycles, squad cars, a firetruck and street lights were added to the final shot.

Several of the film's establishing shots of the 70s-era Bay Area were created by the Marin County effects house <a href="Matte%20World%20Digital">Matte World Digital</a>. The "helicopter shots" of the fireworks-laden sky over Vallejo, the San Francisco waterfront, and the overhead shot of the cab driving through San Francisco were CG, as was the shot looking down at traffic from the tower of the Golden Gate Bridge. A <a href="Time-lapse%20photography">time-lapse</a> sequence of the construction of the <a href="Transamerica%20Pyramid">Transamerica Pyramid</a> was a hybrid of 2D and 3D <a href="matte%20painting">matte painting</a>, created using reference photos of the Pyramid taken from the rooftop of Francis Ford Coppola's <a href="Columbus%20Tower%20%28San%20Francisco%29">Sentinel Building</a>. MWD visual effects supervisor <a href="Craig%20Barron">Craig Barron</a> researched the Pyramid's construction for accuracy.

Originally, Fincher envisioned the film's soundtrack to be composed of 40 cues of vintage music spanning the nearly three decades of the Zodiac story. With music supervisor George Drakoulias, Fincher searched for the right pop songs that reflected the era, including <a href="Three%20Dog%20Night">Three Dog Night</a>'s cover of "<a href="Easy%20to%20Be%20Hard">Easy to Be Hard</a>" because "it's so ingrained in my psyche as being what the summer of '69 sounded like in northern California". Initially, Fincher did not envision an original score for the film, but rather a tapestry of sound design, vintage songs of the period, sound bites and clips of KFRC (an AM radio giant) and "Mathews Top of the Hill Daly City" (home of a prominent hi-fi dealership of the time). He told the studio that he did not need a composer and would buy various songs instead. They agreed, but as the film developed, sound designer and longtime Fincher collaborator Ren Klyce felt there were places in some scenes that could have used music. Kylce inserted music from two of his favorite soundtracks, <a href="David%20Shire">David Shire</a>'s scores for "<a href="The%20Conversation">The Conversation</a>" and "<a href="All%20the%20President%27s%20Men%20%28film%29">All the President's Men</a>". Fincher was eager to work with Shire as "All the President's Men" was one of his favorite films and one of the primary cinematic influences on "Zodiac". He reminded Klyce of the deal that he had made with the studio.

Klyce contacted sound and film editor <a href="Walter%20Murch">Walter Murch</a> who worked on "The Conversation" and he got Klyce in touch with Shire. Fincher sent the composer a copy of the script and flew him in for a meeting and a screening in L.A. At first, Fincher only wanted 15–20 minutes of score and for it to be all based on solo piano. As Shire worked on it and incorporated textures of a <a href="Charles%20Ives">Charles Ives</a> piece called "<a href="The%20Unanswered%20Question">The Unanswered Question</a>" and "Conversation"-based cues, he found that he had 37 minutes of original music. The orchestra Shire assembled consisted of musicians from the San Francisco Opera and S.F. ballet. Shire said, "There are 12 signs of the Zodiac and there is a way of using atonal and tonal music. So we used 12 tones, never repeating any of them but manipulating them". He used specific instruments to represent the characters: the trumpet for Toschi, the solo piano for Graysmith and the dissonant strings for the Zodiac killer.

An early version of "Zodiac" ran three hours and eight minutes. It was supposed to be released in time for <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a> consideration but Paramount felt that the film ran too long and asked Fincher to make changes. Contractually, he had final cut and once he reached a length he felt was right, the director refused to make any further cuts. To trim down the film to two hours and forty minutes, he had to cut a two-minute blackout montage of "hit songs signaling the passage of time from <a href="Joni%20Mitchell">Joni Mitchell</a> to <a href="Donna%20Summer">Donna Summer</a>." It was replaced with a title card that reads, "Four years later." Another cut scene that test screening audiences did not like involved "three guys talking into a speakerphone" to get a search warrant as Toschi and Armstrong talk to SFPD Capt. Marty Lee (<a href="Dermot%20Mulroney">Dermot Mulroney</a>) about their case against suspect Arthur Leigh Allen. Fincher said that this scene would probably be put back on the DVD.

To promote "Zodiac", Paramount posted on light-poles in major cities original sketches of the actual Zodiac killer with the words, "In theaters March 2nd," at the bottom. The film was screened in competition at the <a href="2007%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">2007 Cannes Film Festival</a> on May 17, 2007 with Fincher and Gyllenhaal participating in a press conference afterwards. The <a href="director%27s%20cut">director's cut</a> of "Zodiac" was given a rare screening at the <a href="Walter%20Reade">Walter Reade</a> Theater in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> on November 19, 2007 with Fincher being interviewed by film critic Kent Jones afterwards.

The <a href="DVD">DVD</a> for "Zodiac" was released on July 24, 2007 and is available widescreen or fullscreen, presented in anamorphic widescreen, and an English <a href="Dolby%20Digital">Dolby Digital</a> 5.1 Surround track. There are no extra materials included.

According to David Prior, producer of the subsequent two-disc special edition, the initial bare bones edition "was only reluctantly agreed to by Fincher because I needed more time on the bonus material. The studio was locked into their release date, so Fincher allowed that version to be released first. It had nothing to do with Fincher 'double dipping his own movie before it even makes it to stores' and everything to do with buying more time for the special edition". He stated that the theatrical cut would only be available on the single-disc edition. Prior elaborated further: "Nobody wants fans feeling like they're being taken advantage of, and I know that double-dipping creates that impression. That's why it was so important to me that consumers be told there was another version coming. In this case it really was a rock-and-a-hard-place situation, and delaying the second release was done strictly for the benefit of the final product... But this is a very ambitious project, easily the most far-reaching I've ever worked on, and owing largely to studio snafus that I can't really elaborate on, I didn't have enough time to do it properly. Thus Fincher bought me the extra time by agreeing to a staggered release, which I'm very grateful for". In its first week, rentals for the DVD earned $6.7 million.

The two-disc <a href="director%27s%20cut">director's cut</a> DVD and <a href="HD%20DVD">HD DVD</a> were released on January 8, 2008, with its UK release on <a href="Blu-ray%20Disc">Blu-ray</a> and DVD announced for September 29, 2008. Disc 1 features, in addition to a longer cut of the film, an <a href="audio%20commentary">audio commentary</a> by Fincher and a second by Gyllenhaal, Downey, Fischer, Vanderbilt, and author James Ellroy. Disc 2 includes a <a href="Film%20trailer">trailer</a>, a "Zodiac Deciphered" documentary, a "Visual Effects of Zodiac" featurette, previsualization split-screen comparisons for the Blue Rock Springs, Lake Berryessa, and San Francisco murder sequences, a "This is the Zodiac Speaking" featurette, and a "His Name Was Arthur Leigh Allen" featurette. Other extras apparently originally intended for the set, including TV spots and featurettes on "Digital Workflow", "Linguistic Analysis", "Jeopardy Surface: Geographic Profiling" (Dr. <a href="Rossmo%27s%20formula">Kim Rossmo</a>'s <a href="Geographic%20profiling">geographic profile</a> of the Zodiac), and "The Psychology of Aggression: Behavioral Profiling" (Special Agent Sharon Pagaling-Hagan's behavioral profile of the Zodiac) were omitted. However, the latter three featurettes were made available on the film's website. This new version runs five minutes longer than the theatrical cut. For Oscar contention, Paramount distributed the Director's Cut DVD to the <a href="Producers%20Guild%20of%20America">Producers Guild of America</a>, the <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America">Writers Guild of America</a> and the <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild">Screen Actors Guild</a>, instead of the official release version. This was the first time that the studio had done this.

Opening in 2,362 theaters on March 2, 2007, the film grossed <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>13.3 million in its opening weekend, placing second and posting a per-theater average of $5,671. The film was outgrossed by fellow opener "<a href="Wild%20Hogs">Wild Hogs</a>" and saw a decline of over 50% in its second weekend, losing out to the record-breaking "<a href="300%20%28film%29">300</a>". It grossed $33 million in North America and $51 million in the rest of the world, bringing its current total to $84 million. In an interview with "<a href="Sight%20%26amp%3B%20Sound">Sight & Sound</a>" magazine, Fincher addressed the film's low gross at the North American box office: "Even with the box office being what it is, I still think there's an audience out there for this movie. Everyone has a different idea about marketing, but my philosophy is that if you market a movie to 16-year-old boys and don't deliver "<a href="Saw%20%282004%20film%29">Saw</a>" or "<a href="Seven%20%281995%20film%29">Seven</a>", they're going to be the most vociferous ones coming out of the screening saying 'This movie sucks.' And you're saying goodbye to the audience who would get it because they're going to look at the ads and say, 'I don't want to see some <a href="slasher%20film">slasher movie</a>.'"

Overall, reviews of the film were highly positive. "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" critic <a href="Owen%20Gleiberman">Owen Gleiberman</a> awarded the film an "A" grade, hailing the film as a "procedural thriller for the <a href="information%20age">information age</a>" that "spins your head in a new way, luring you into a vortex and then deeper still." Nathan Lee in his review for "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" wrote that director Fincher's "very lack of pretense, coupled with a determination to get the facts down with maximum economy and objectivity, gives "Zodiac" its hard, bright integrity. As a crime saga, newspaper drama, and period piece, it works just fine. As an allegory of life in the information age, it blew my mind." Todd McCarthy's review in "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" praised the film's "almost unerringly accurate evocation of the workaday San Francisco of 35–40 years ago. Forget the distorted emphasis on hippies and flower-power that many such films indulge in; this is the city as it was experienced by most people who lived and worked there." <a href="David%20Ansen">David Ansen</a>, in his review for "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" magazine, wrote, ""Zodiac" is meticulously crafted – Harris Savides's state-of-the-art digital cinematography has a richness indistinguishable from film – and it runs almost two hours and 40 minutes. Still, the movie holds you in its grip from start to finish. Fincher boldly (and some may think perversely) withholds the emotional and forensic payoff we're conditioned to expect from a big studio movie." <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> gave the film 4 stars out of a possible 4, writing: "The film is a <a href="police%20procedural">police procedural</a> crossed with a newspaper movie, but free of most of the cliches of either. Its most impressive accomplishment is to gather a bewildering labyrinth of facts and suspicions over a period of years, and make the journey through this maze frightening and suspenseful." Ebert also praised the casting (critical in an ensemble film) and, as a longtime columnist for "The Chicago Sun-Times", asserted "Zodiac" was "intriguing in its accuracy" in showing the operation of a major newspaper.

Some critics, however, were displeased with the film's long running time and lack of action scenes. "The film gets mired in the inevitable red tape of police investigations," wrote Bob Longino of "<a href="The%20Atlanta%20Journal-Constitution">The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>", who also felt that the film "stumbles to a rather unfulfilling conclusion" and "seems to last as long as the <a href="Academy%20Awards">Oscars</a>." <a href="Andrew%20Sarris">Andrew Sarris</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Observer">The New York Observer</a>" felt that "Mr. Fincher's flair for casting is the major asset of his curiously attenuated return to the serial-killer genre. I keep saying 'curiously' with regard to Mr. Fincher, because I can't really figure out what he is up to in "Zodiac" – with its two-hour-and-37-minute running time for what struck me as a shaggy-dog narrative." Christy Lemire wrote in the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" that "Jake Gyllenhaal is both the central figure and the weakest link... But he's never fleshed out sufficiently to make you believe that he'd sacrifice his safety and that of his family to find the truth. We are told repeatedly that the former Eagle Scout is just a genuinely good guy, but that's not enough."

In the United Kingdom, "<a href="Time%20Out%20%28company%29">Time Out</a>" magazine wrote, ""Zodiac" isn't a puzzle film in quite that way; instead its subject is the compulsion to solve puzzles, and its coup is the creeping recognition, quite contrary to the flow of crime cinema, of how fruitless that compulsion can be." Peter Bradshaw in his review for "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" commended the film for its "sheer cinematic virility," and gave it four stars out of five. In his review for "<a href="Empire%20%28film%20magazine%29">Empire</a>" magazine, <a href="Kim%20Newman">Kim Newman</a> gave the film four out of five stars and wrote, "You'll need patience with the film's approach, which follows its main characters by poring over details, and be prepared to put up with a couple of rote family arguments and weary cop conversations, but this gripping character study becomes more agonisingly suspenseful as it gets closer to an answer that can't be confirmed." Graham Fuller in "<a href="Sight%20%26amp%3B%20Sound">Sight & Sound</a>" magazine wrote, "the tone is pleasingly flat and mundane, evoking the demoralising grind of police work in a pre-feminist, pre-technological era. As such, "Zodiac" is considerably more adult than both "<a href="Seven%20%281995%20film%29">Seven</a>", which salivates over the macabre cat-and-mouse game it plays with the audience, and the macho brinkmanship of "<a href="Fight%20Club%20%28film%29">Fight Club</a>"." Not all British critics liked the film. David Thompson in "The Guardian" felt that in relation to the rest of Fincher's career, "Zodiac" was "the worst yet, a terrible disappointment in which an ingenious and deserving all-American serial killer nearly gets lost in the meandering treatment of cops and journalists obsessed with the case."

In France, "<a href="Le%20Monde">Le Monde</a>" newspaper praised Fincher for having "obtained a maturity that impresses by his mastery of form," while "<a href="Lib%C3%A9ration">Libération</a>" described the film as "a thriller of elegance magnificently photographed by the great Harry Savides." However, "<a href="Le%20Figaro">Le Figaro</a>" wrote, "No audacity, no invention, nothing but a plot which intrigues without captivating, disturbs without terrifying, interests without exciting."

, "Zodiac" has a rating of 90% on <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, based on 243 reviews dubbing it "Certified Fresh" with an average rating of 7.7/10. Its consensus states "A quiet, dialogue-driven thriller that delivers with scene after scene of gut-wrenching anxiety. David Fincher also spends more time illustrating nuances of his characters and recreating the mood of the 70s than he does on gory details of murder." It also has a 78 metascore at <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>.

Only two 2007 films ("<a href="No%20Country%20for%20Old%20Men%20%28film%29">No Country for Old Men</a>" and "<a href="There%20Will%20Be%20Blood">There Will Be Blood</a>") appeared on more critics' top ten lists than "Zodiac". Some of the notable top-ten list appearances are:

In the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a>'s 2012 "<a href="Sight%20%26amp%3B%20Sound">Sight & Sound</a>" polls of the greatest movies ever made, three critics and one director – <a href="Bong%20Joon-ho">Bong Joon-ho</a> – named "Zodiac" one of their 10 favorite films. In August 2016, it was ranked 12th on a critics' poll conducted by <a href="BBC">BBC</a> of the 21st century's greatest films.

Tyrone Wheatley

Tyrone Anthony Wheatley, Sr. (born January 19, 1972) is currently the head football coach at <a href="Morgan%20State%20University">Morgan State University</a>. He is also a former professional player who played 10 <a href="season%20%28sports%29">seasons</a> in the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> (NFL) and was one of the most successful <a href="high%20school">high school</a> and <a href="College">collegiate</a> athletes in <a href="Metro%20Detroit">Metropolitan Detroit</a> history. In high school, he was a member of state-champion teams in both <a href="Track%20and%20field%20athletics">track and field</a> and football, and he was named <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>'s track and field athlete of the year and football athlete of the year in the same <a href="academic%20year">academic year</a>. He earned <a href="All-America">All-America</a> track honors in both high school and college. Following his graduation as one of Michigan's best high school athletes, he attended the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a> on an <a href="athletic%20scholarship">athletic scholarship</a> and earned first-team All-<a href="Big%20Ten%20Conference">Big Ten Conference</a> honors on Big Ten Champion football and track teams. He ranks among the Wolverines' all-time <a href="Rush%20%28American%20football%29">rushing</a> leaders in numerous categories, and his name appears in several places in the Big Ten football record book. He was named to All-Big Ten teams in football and track and field a total of four times, and he earned portions of seven Big Ten championships (two team awards for football, one team award for indoor track, one award for <a href="110%20meter%20hurdles">110 meter hurdles</a>, and three awards for individual football statistical performances).

Following his graduation from the University of Michigan, Wheatley was selected by the <a href="New%20York%20Giants">New York Giants</a> of the NFL in the first round of the <a href="1995%20NFL%20Draft">1995 NFL Draft</a>. As a running back for the Giants, he was the team's <a href="all-purpose%20yards">all-purpose yards</a> leader in 1996 and their leading <a href="Carry%20%28American%20football%29">ballcarrier</a> in 1997. Despite his success on the field, he developed a reputation for indolence. He was traded to the <a href="Miami%20Dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a>, but cut before the <a href="1999%20NFL%20season">1999 season</a> began. He signed with the <a href="Oakland%20Raiders">Oakland Raiders</a> and flourished, leading the team in rushing three times and twice finishing among the NFL's top ten players in rushing <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a>s. During his NFL career (<a href="1995%20NFL%20season">1995</a>–<a href="2004%20NFL%20season">2004</a>), he totaled over 6,500 all-purpose yards as a <a href="running%20back">running back</a> and <a href="kickoff%20returner">kickoff returner</a>.

After retiring from the NFL, Wheatley returned to his hometown to coach his high school alma mater, <a href="Dearborn%20Heights%2C%20Michigan">Dearborn Heights</a>' Hamilton J. Robichaud High School. He has served as the <a href="running%20backs%20coach">running backs coach</a> for the <a href="Ohio%20Northern%20University">Ohio Northern Polar Bears</a>, the <a href="Eastern%20Michigan%20Eagles%20football">Eastern Michigan Eagles</a>, the <a href="Syracuse%20Orange%20football">Syracuse Orange</a> and the <a href="Michigan%20Wolverines%20football">Michigan Wolverines</a> on college; and for the <a href="Buffalo%20Bills">Buffalo Bills</a> and the <a href="Jacksonville%20Jaguars">Jacksonville Jaguars</a> of the <a href="NFL">NFL</a>.

Wheatley was born in <a href="Inkster%2C%20Michigan">Inkster, Michigan</a>. Inkster is located in <a href="Metro%20Detroit">Metropolitan Detroit</a>, east of both <a href="Ann%20Arbor%2C%20Michigan">Ann Arbor</a> and University of Michigan. Wheatley's father (also named Tyrone) suffered a mortal <a href="gunshot">gunshot</a> wound to the head in 1974 when Wheatley was two years old. Wheatley's <a href="stepfather">stepfather</a> died of a heart attack when he was 13, leaving behind Wheatley, his sister, and half-brother, two-year-old Leslie Mongo. Shortly afterward, Wheatley's mother, Patricia, was <a href="layoff">laid off</a> and became an <a href="alcoholic">alcoholic</a>. With the effective loss of his two parents, Wheatley and his sister were forced to move in with an aunt, where he lived through the rest of his childhood. Due to family difficulties, Wheatley acts as the guardian of two cousins and his half brother. Mongo was ten years younger than Wheatley, and graduated from high school in New Jersey in 2004—thirteen years after Wheatley had graduated from high school.

Wheatley was involved in competitive athletics from an early age: In his youth, he ran competitively with the Penn Park track team, where, as an eight-year-old, he stood out for his discipline and promptness. Because of his family trouble, he assumed a family leadership role at a relatively young age. Wheatley made it clear to his brothers and sisters that when chaos came to their lives, they should to turn to him because he would be there and he would never fall. When he was in high school, he would take his younger siblings to basketball games, mapping out emergency plans for shooting outbreaks or brawls. Wheatley's guardianship continued throughout his career at the University of Michigan and while he was a professional athlete. While playing in the NFL, he realized that leaving Mongo—the youngest of his siblings—in Inkster and merely providing financial support was not a solution because Mongo was still exposed to <a href="gang">gang</a> shootings. As Mongo's guardian, Wheatley moved Mongo to <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> for school. Mongo later earned outstanding freshman athlete honors during the <a href="Bergen%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Bergen County, New Jersey</a> outdoor track championships while living with Wheatley, who was playing for the Giants at the time. In 2004, with his graduation from high school imminent, Mongo signed a <a href="letter%20of%20intent">letter of intent</a> with <a href="Utah%20State%20Aggies%20football">Utah State</a> as a <a href="defensive%20back">defensive back</a>.

Wheatley attended Hamilton J. Robichaud High School in <a href="Dearborn%20Heights%2C%20Michigan">Dearborn Heights, Michigan</a>, a neighboring municipality of Inkster. During his time at Robichaud High School, he became a nine-time MHSAA state champion (seven-time individual in track and field, one-time team each in track and field and football). He is among the highest-scoring football players in Michigan high school history, and he led his high school to the state football championships while playing eight different positions and being named the Michigan Football Player of the year. In the 1990 MHSAA Championship game against <a href="Upper%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">upper peninsula</a> powerhouse <a href="Kingsford%20High%20School">Kingsford High School</a> at the <a href="Pontiac%20Silverdome">Pontiac Silverdome</a>, Wheatley ran for 165 yards and a touchdown in a 21–7 victory. That season, he led the Bulldogs to a 12–1 record, and to their only state football championship. He has been described as the greatest football player in Michigan High School history.

In track and field, he won the Michigan High School Track and Cross Country Athlete of the Year award in 1991. However, at one point Wheatley had quit the track team because the coach refused to let him run four individual events as a <a href="Sprint%20%28running%29">sprinter</a>, jumper and <a href="Hurdling">hurdler</a>. The coach relented, and Wheatley became a seven-time MHSAA Class B individual state champion by winning the <a href="long%20jump">long jump</a>, <a href="100%20meters">100 meters</a>, <a href="110%20meter%20hurdles">110-meter hurdles</a> both his junior and senior seasons and winning the <a href="200%20meters">200 meters</a> as junior. In his junior year, he led his school to the state Class B track championships, and he became the first individual four-time track and field state champion in the same year in MHSAA history. Through the 2007 MHSAA season he was the MHSAA All class <a href="long%20jump">long jump</a> record holder with a 1991 leap of , his high school <a href="100%20meters">100 meters</a> time (10.59 seconds, 1990) continues to rank third in MHSAA history, and his <a href="110%20meter%20hurdles">110 meter hurdles</a> time (13.87 sec., 1991) ranked seventh in MHSAA history. In addition, through the 2007 track season his hurdle time continued to be a MHSAA <a href="Lower%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">lower peninsula</a> Class B state record. His long jump record has been retired. Wheatley became a high school <a href="All-America">All-America</a>n in track, and he was also a member of successful relay teams in high school. He had made a name for himself as a nine-time <a href="Michigan%20High%20School%20Athletic%20Association">Michigan High School Athletic Association</a> (MHSAA) state champion athlete. His athleticism and jumping abilities were further exhibited in basketball; Wheatley played for his high school basketball team and was able to <a href="slam%20dunk">slam dunk</a>. He claims that against his high school rival, <a href="Inkster%20High%20School">Inkster High School</a>, he performed a dunk from the foul line, which is a difficult dunk made famous in slam dunk competitions by <a href="Julius%20Erving">Julius Erving</a> (Dr. J.) and later revived by <a href="Michael%20Jordan">Michael Jordan</a>. Yet, despite his versatility and promise, Wheatley considered turning down athletic scholarships in hopes of obtaining an academic scholarship.

Wheatley chose to remain in metropolitan Detroit and attend the University of Michigan on an athletic scholarship. He played running back for the football team for four years and ran on the track team for three years. As both a football player and track athlete he was highly decorated; he earned first-team All-Big Ten honors on teams that won Big Ten Championships in both sports and All-American Honors in track. In football, he set and retains numerous school records and in track he achieved some of the fastest times in school history. <a href="Offensive%20coordinator">Offensive coordinator</a> <a href="Fred%20Jackson%20%28American%20football%20coach%29">Fred Jackson</a> recalled that Wheatley was always prompt, never overweight, played while injured, and even babysat for Jackson's children. Wheatley was described in the press as a football player who put his team ahead of himself.

Wheatley wore #6 for the <a href="Michigan%20Wolverines%20football">Michigan Wolverines football</a> program from <a href="1991%20NCAA%20Division%20I-A%20football%20season">1991</a> to <a href="1994%20NCAA%20Division%20I-A%20football%20season">1994</a>. At the end of the 2007 season, he ranked third in Michigan football history in career points and second in career <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a>s (behind <a href="Anthony%20Thomas%20%28American%20football%29">Anthony Thomas</a>) with forty seven <a href="Rush%20%28American%20football%29">rushing</a> touchdowns, six <a href="Reception%20%28American%20football%29">receiving</a> touchdowns and one <a href="kickoff%20return">kickoff return</a> for a touchdown. His 47 rushing touchdowns, which ranked third in <a href="Big%20Ten%20Conference">Big Ten</a> history at the end of his career, ranked fifth behind <a href="Ron%20Dayne">Ron Dayne</a> (71), <a href="Anthony%20Thompson%20%28football%20player%29">Anthony Thompson</a> (68), <a href="Pete%20Johnson">Pete Johnson</a> (56) and Thomas through the 2006 season. His 17 touchdowns in 1992 ranks as the fifth most productive offensive season in Michigan history. In <a href="1992%20NCAA%20Division%20I-A%20football%20season">1992</a>, he was the Big Ten rushing and scoring champion in an offense where <a href="1992%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20football%20team">Michigan</a> <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> <a href="Elvis%20Grbac">Elvis Grbac</a> was also a statistical Big Ten champion. He earned the <a href="Big%20Ten%20Conference%20football%20individual%20honors%23Offensive%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year Award</a> that season and capped the season off by earning the <a href="Most%20Valuable%20Player">MVP</a> of the <a href="1993%20Rose%20Bowl">1993 Rose Bowl</a> on a 235-yard, 15-carry performance against <a href="1992%20Washington%20Huskies%20football%20team">Washington Huskies</a>, which included touchdown runs of 88, 56 and 24 yards.

Through the 2012 season, he ranks fifth on the Michigan career rushing yards list (behind <a href="Mike%20Hart%20%28American%20football%29">Mike Hart</a>, <a href="Denard%20Robinson">Denard Robinson</a>, Anthony Thomas, and <a href="Jamie%20Morris">Jamie Morris</a>) with 4,178 yards. His 1992 <a href="Sophomore%20year">sophomore</a> season 7.3 yards per carry is a Michigan single-season record (minimum 75 attempts), and his <a href="freshman">freshman</a> yards per carry average ranks fourth at Michigan since 1949 (and it is a Michigan Freshman record). He has both the best and second-best single-game (minimum 15 carries) yards per carry performances in Michigan history. He was a three-time All Big Ten selection.

As a freshman for the <a href="1991%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20football%20team">1991 Wolverines</a>, Wheatley set the Michigan freshman yards per attempt record with 555 yards on 86 carries for a 6.4 yards per attempt. In his sophomore year, he broke through with his first of three consecutive first team All-Big Ten selections. He rushed for 1,357 yards and 13 Rushing touchdowns in addition to 3 Receiving touchdowns and recording a kickoff return touchdown while subbing for the injured <a href="Ricky%20Powers">Ricky Powers</a>. Wheatley had amassed the most touchdowns by a running back in Michigan history by the end of his junior year and was a professional prospect. In <a href="1993%20NCAA%20Division%20I-A%20football%20season">1993</a> at the end of his junior season <a href="1993%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20football%20team">1993 Wolverines</a>, he earned the MVP award of the 1994 <a href="Hall%20of%20Fame%20Bowl">Hall of Fame Bowl</a>. Wheatley had finished 8th in the 1993 <a href="Heisman%20Trophy">Heisman Trophy</a> race. Before <a href="LeShon%20Johnson">LeShon Johnson</a>'s 306 yard effort in November of that season against <a href="1993%20Iowa%20Hawkeyes%20football%20team">Iowa</a> team that Wheatley had rushed for 113 yards against, Wheatley had been mentioned as the best running back in the nation, but Johnson's effort and <a href="Bam%20Morris">Bam Morris</a>' final three games of 223, 222 and 223 yards led to Bam Morris winning the <a href="Doak%20Walker%20Award">Doak Walker Award</a>. Most who finished ahead of him in the Heisman voting either were seniors (Ward, <a href="Glenn%20Foley">Glenn Foley</a>, Johnson) or gave up their amateur eligibility and declared early for the draft (<a href="Heath%20Shuler">Heath Shuler</a>, <a href="David%20Palmer%20%28American%20football%29">David Palmer</a>, <a href="Marshall%20Faulk">Marshall Faulk</a>), which made Wheatley one of the favorites for the award if he stayed in college for one more year. He stayed at Michigan for another year with the stated intent of obtaining his degree, but stayed without receiving the degree. However, the preseason 1994 Heisman Trophy favorite (along with 7th-place finisher <a href="J.%20J.%20Stokes">J. J. Stokes</a>), missed the beginning of the season with an injury to the same shoulder that had caused him to miss two games in 1993. His return to the lineup on September 24, 1994 was overshadowed by <a href="The%20Miracle%20at%20Michigan">The Miracle at Michigan</a>. His senior season return to the <a href="1994%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20football%20team">1994 Wolverines</a> had been a surprise, but injuries allowed <a href="Tim%20Biakabutuka">Tshimanga Biakabutuka</a> and Ed Davis to get some playing time. He only finished 12th in the Heisman balloting as a senior. Nonetheless, he thought that his senior-year experience broadened his horizons.

In college, Wheatley also competed in track and earned <a href="varsity%20letter">varsity letter</a>s in 1993–1995. In 1994, he was the Big Ten outdoor <a href="110%20metre%20hurdles">110 metre hurdles</a> champion, was selected first team All-Big Ten, and was a member of the men's indoor track and field team that won the indoor Big Ten team championship. He placed eighth at the 1995 NCAA outdoor championships in the 110 meter hurdles, which earned him All-American honors. At the end of his Michigan track career, he owned the third fastest indoor <a href="60%20metres">60m</a> time in Michigan history at 6.80 seconds as well as the second fastest outdoor 110 metre hurdles time at 13.77 seconds and third fastest outdoor 100 meters at 10.46 seconds. Gradually, succeeding athletes have surpassed his times, and after the 2007 season the 110 meter hurdle time ranked fourth best and the 100 meter dash time was fifth.

Wheatley was drafted by the New York Giants in the first round of the <a href="1995%20NFL%20Draft">1995 NFL Draft</a> with the seventeenth overall selection. He held out for 17 days before signing a five-year contract with the team. The terms included a $2.3 million <a href="signing%20bonus">signing bonus</a> and escalating base salaries totaling over $2.9 million. The negotiations were prolonged in part because of extensive family involvement. Wheatley set no goals for himself and lived by his grandmother's motto on preparing oneself: "You can set your sails, but you can't set the wind". The Giants viewed Wheatley as their running back of the future, since <a href="Rodney%20Hampton">Rodney Hampton</a> was in the final year of his contract.
Despite the original visions, Wheatley was used sparingly and started only eight games over the course of four seasons with the Giants. Off the field, Wheatley moved his half-brother with him to New Jersey to keep him out of the tumultuous environment and to provide him a strong learning environment.

In 1995 and 1996, under <a href="Dan%20Reeves">Dan Reeves</a> the Giants had losing seasons and relied heavily on <a href="Rodney%20Hampton">Rodney Hampton</a> who received the bulk of the carries on rushing plays. In <a href="1995%20NFL%20season">1995</a>, running back <a href="Herschel%20Walker">Herschel Walker</a> received more passing downs and in <a href="1996%20NFL%20season">1996</a> <a href="fullback%20%28American%20football%29">fullback</a> <a href="Charles%20Way">Charles Way</a> was a main weapon. Wheatley returned kickoffs for the 1995 and 1996, with 10 returns for 18.6 yards per return in 1995 and 23 returns for 21.9 yards per return in 1996. While Hampton led the team in rushing with 827 yards to Wheatley's 400 yards in 1996, Wheatley's 503 <a href="return%20yards">return yards</a> and 51 yards receiving gave him the team <a href="All-purpose%20yardage">all-purpose yards</a> leadership. However, Wheatley had 6 <a href="fumble">fumble</a>s on only 147 touches (112 rushes, 12 receptions, and 23 kickoff returns).

The drafting of Wheatley had been hotly contested. Some Giant draft war-room personnel had wanted to select <a href="Korey%20Stringer">Korey Stringer</a> and others had an interest in <a href="Rashaan%20Salaam">Rashaan Salaam</a> when the Giants' selection came. After Wheatley was selected with the seventeenth pick, running backs <a href="Napoleon%20Kaufman">Napoleon Kaufman</a>, <a href="James%20Stewart%20%28American%20football%2C%20born%20December%2027%2C%201971%29">James Stewart</a> and Rashaan Salaam were chosen with the eighteenth, nineteenth and twenty-first selections, respectively. Reeves made it no secret that he would have selected Salaam over Wheatley in the <a href="1995%20NFL%20Draft">draft</a>. Wheatley's introduction to the Giants was a contract squabble that kept him from getting to <a href="National%20Football%20League%20Training%20Camp">training camp</a> on time. Then, in rookie season training camp, he had the misfortune of pulling a <a href="hamstring">hamstring</a> while running sprints on the first day. Speculation had been that the injury had occurred in a stumble in a June track meet. Reeves held the prompt injury against the running back he never wanted. Wheatley later fell asleep in a meeting which drew a fine from Reeves. Although he only actually fell asleep in one meeting, he also had mental concentration issues in practice. He was not known for living erratically so his falling asleep and loss of concentration was enough of a problem that the Giants had Wheatley evaluated. On top of this, Wheatley was fined several times for tardiness to team meetings.

In <a href="1997%20NFL%20season">1997</a>, by the end of training camp, Rodney Hampton's knees had given out, and although Wheatley had a great camp, <a href="Tiki%20Barber">Tiki Barber</a> was named the starting <a href="Halfback%20%28American%20football%29">tailback</a>. That season, <a href="Jim%20Fassel">Jim Fassel</a>'s first, the Giants went to the <a href="NFL%20playoffs%2C%201997-98">playoffs</a> with a 10–5–1 record. Wheatley led the team in carries that season despite missing two games and shared the ballcarrying responsibilities with Way and Barber. On October 12, Wheatley had his first 100-yard game with 102 yards on 22 carries against the <a href="Arizona%20Cardinals">Arizona Cardinals</a> in a 27–13 victory on the road. While Wheatley and Way divided the rushing load, Barber and Way divided most of the responsibility for the running backs' role in the passing attack, while Wheatley had less than half as many <a href="reception%20%28American%20football%29">receptions</a> and reception yards as either of them. An ankle injury caused Wheatley to miss the final two regular season games and the <a href="wild%20card%20%28sports%29">wild card</a> <a href="playoff">playoff</a> game.

By <a href="1998%20NFL%20season">1998</a>, Wheatley was the only four-year veteran in the Giants backfield and although he developed another good relationship with an offensive coordinator, he was becoming accustomed to being described as an enigma. The Giants fell to 8–8 while relying on Barber, Way and Gary Brown. During the season, Wheatley often performed <a href="scout%20team">scout team</a> duties and was inactive for some games. Fassel was not sympathetic to Wheatley's desire for playing time and thought that Wheatley was overweight. Over the course of the season, there was controversy about a season long weight limit of that had been placed on Wheatley. Wheatley's playing weight limit had been set at in <a href="training%20camp">training camp</a> and had been raised to 235 on Wheatley's request. He had played at in the final game of his college career. By week 11, Wheatley had only dressed in five games and played in four and was relegated to a role as an alternate when he played.

Wheatley thought he was treated unfairly in New York although two different coaching staffs had issues with him. He points out <a href="double%20standard">double standard</a>s that gave him bad feelings in retrospect. In situations where he was not the only Giant who was overweight or stuck in traffic, he was punished while others were not and those with worse problems such as showing up at practice drunk or being cited for <a href="Drunk%20driving%20%28United%20States%29">D.U.I.</a> were not vilified. Wheatley had the responsibility of driving his brother, Leslie Mongo, to his school that opened at 8:15 and thought he was the victim of New Jersey traffic in relation to occasionally being late for 9:00 a.m. team meetings. Charles Way, by contrast, Wheatley's closest friend on the team and <a href="roommate">roommate</a> on the road, was nicknamed "Teacher's Pet."

According to "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", there was a misperception of Wheatley as a "cancer" in the locker room by most accounts. Although he had some issues, his teammates remembered him for his personality and mannerly nature. The general opinion of Wheatley was that he was blessed with enormous talent, but as a package he was an enigma. According to <a href="Michael%20Strahan">Michael Strahan</a>, Wheatley "...could outrun the <a href="wide%20receiver">wide receiver</a>s, outlift the <a href="Lineman%20%28American%20football%29">linemen</a> and outdebate anyone." Thus, his off-season workout pattern of sloughing the weights for discussion of politics and current affairs was troubling, but not challenged because he could outlift most. However, in addition to the enigmatic issues, Wheatley had physical problems in New York. He was injured and unable to perform for parts of all four of the training camps. After the 1998 season Wheatley was traded to <a href="Jimmy%20Johnson%20%28American%20football%20coach%29">Jimmy Johnson</a>'s <a href="Miami%20Dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a>. In the February trade, the Giants were satisfied receiving a seventh round draft pick in return.

The Dolphins hoped that Wheatley would compete for the starting tailback position with <a href="Abdul-Karim%20al-Jabbar">Abdul-Karim al-Jabbar</a>, who had rushed for a league-leading 15 touchdowns in 1997 but whose production had fallen off to only 6 in 1998. However, Wheatley was cut from the Miami Dolphins training camp roster. He had only gone through one week of Dolphins training camp before being released, making him available to the Raiders. The Raiders signed Wheatley on August 4, 1999 to help make up for the loss of <a href="Zack%20Crockett">Zack Crockett</a> who suffered a broken foot. Ironically, Wheatley, the seventeenth overall selection in the <a href="1995%20NFL%20Draft">1995 NFL Draft</a>, earned his <a href="1999%20NFL%20season">1999</a> roster spot in a battle with <a href="Rashaan%20Salaam">Rashaan Salaam</a>, the twenty-first overall selection in the 1995 NFL Draft, who had been Dan Reeves' preferred draft choice in 1995. Wheatley was paired in the Raiders backfield with <a href="Napoleon%20Kaufman">Napoleon Kaufman</a>, the eighteenth overall selection in the 1995 NFL Draft.

While in <a href="Oakland%2C%20California">Oakland</a>, Wheatley would achieve much greater success than he had in New York. Wheatley rushed for 1,000 yards in a season, led the Raiders in rushing three times, appeared in three consecutive playoffs (including one Super Bowl) and finished in the top-10 in the NFL for rushing touchdowns twice. Through the <a href="2007%20NFL%20season">2007 NFL season</a>, Wheatley was the seventh leading rusher in Oakland Raider history with 3,682 yards as a Raider. In his role as a Raider, Wheatley was able to contribute to some of the greatest memories in the history of the franchise. Seven of his eight career 100-yard rushing games came as a Raider. Five of these games were at the <a href="McAfee%20Coliseum">Oakland Coliseum</a> and two were on the <a href="road%20%28sports%29">road</a> against the <a href="Seattle%20Seahawks">Seattle Seahawks</a>. None of these games came in the playoffs where his highest rushing total was 56 yards.

How well Wheatley complemented Napoleon Kaufman in Oakland was quickly evident to the New York media, and his newfound success was noticed when the Giants had an impotent running game in his absence. In his early years with the Raiders, Wheatley quickly made good on the promise of his potential with a combination of the power to run inside and the speed to run outside. Wheatley was quite popular in Oakland. The players liked him and his coach, <a href="Jon%20Gruden">Jon Gruden</a>, even joked with him during his interviews.

On the field, Wheatley became an important part of a surprisingly efficient <a href="West%20Coast%20offense">West Coast offense</a> run by <a href="Jon%20Gruden">Jon Gruden</a>. In 1999, Wheatley was the Raiders' leading rusher and their only running back to have more than one touchdown reception. For the first time, Wheatley had multiple 100-yard games in the same season: 100 yards on 20 rushes on October 3 against the Seattle Seahawks and 111 yards on 19 rushes on December 19 against the <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Buccaneers">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a>. The players gelled as a unit and not only did Wheatley have his best seasons in Oakland, but also long time NFL veterans on the Raiders amassed their best season upon his arrival. For example, <a href="Rich%20Gannon">Rich Gannon</a>, an NFL veteran <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> since <a href="1987%20NFL%20season">1987</a>, made his first four <a href="Pro%20Bowl">Pro Bowl</a> appearances with Wheatley as a weapon. The team only compiled an 8–8 record, however.

Wheatley had the best season of his career in the <a href="2000%20NFL%20season">2000</a> as Raiders went 12–4 and reached the <a href="American%20Football%20Conference">American Football Conference</a> championship game of the <a href="NFL%20playoffs%2C%202000-01">2000–01 NFL playoffs</a>. Wheatley amassed 1,046 yards rushing and 9 touchdowns on 232 carries and added 20 receptions for 156 yards. Wheatley combined effectively with Kaufman to form an inside and outside attacking combination in these first two years. Wheatley’s 4.5 yards per carry ranked ninth in the NFL. Not only did Wheatley amass a career-high three 100-yard rushing games that season, but he also had his three highest career single-game performances: 156 yards on only 15 carries on October 22 at home against the Seattle Seahawks, 146 yards on December 16 at Seattle and 112 yards on November 5 against the <a href="Kansas%20City%20Chiefs">Kansas City Chiefs</a>. The 100-yard performances against Seattle were his second and third in his first four games against them as a Raider. In the playoffs, Wheatley only posted a total of 63 yards rushing on 31 carries and one reception for four yards in two home playoff games. On January 6, 2001, Wheatley posted what would turn out to be his career (seven career games) playoff high 56 yards rushing and his only playoff touchdown. In the January 14 conference championship against the Baltimore Ravens he only rushed for 7 yards on 12 carries.

In <a href="2001%20NFL%20season">2001</a>, with the arrival of <a href="Jerry%20Rice">Jerry Rice</a> and <a href="Charlie%20Garner">Charlie Garner</a>, the offense focused on the passing game, running five more pass attempts per game than the year before. The team produced two 1,000-yard receivers with Rice amassing 1,139 yards and <a href="Tim%20Brown%20%28American%20football%29">Tim Brown</a> totaling 1,165 yards. Garner led the team in rushing and accumulated 72 receptions. Meanwhile, Wheatley only started three games and accumulated only 12 receptions over the course of the season. For the first time as a Raider, Wheatley went an entire season without a 100-yard rushing game. The team went 10–6 and returned to the <a href="NFL%20playoffs%2C%202001-02">2001–02 NFL playoffs</a>, but Wheatley only had 88 carries during the regular season despite tying Zack Crockett for the running back leadership with 6 touchdowns. In the first round <a href="Wild%20card%20%28sports%29">wild card</a> game, Wheatley posted his second highest playoff total of 37 yards. In Wheatley's first and only career <a href="road%20%28sports%29">road</a> playoff game, he only posted five yards rushing on four carries.

Under new coach <a href="Bill%20Callahan%20%28coach%29">Bill Callahan</a>, the <a href="2002%20NFL%20season">2002</a> Raiders became more reliant on Garner as the primary running back. Again, Rice and Brown were primary targets for Gannon who, while having his best season with 4,689 yards, did not use Wheatley as a receiver as much as other players. Wheatley had more carries than in 2001, but did not start a single game and did not see the end zone often. Again, Wheatley went an entire season without a 100-yard rushing game. However, as a role player he was able to play in three <a href="NFL%20playoffs%2C%202002-03">2002–03 playoff games</a> including the <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XXXVII">2003 Super Bowl</a> against former coach Gruden. As in his previous seasons, Wheatley posted his best playoff numbers in his first game, this time 30 yards on only four carries. A week later on January 19, 2003, Wheatley had his final post-season carry, a 5-yard run on his only carry of the game. In Super Bowl XXXVII on January 26, Wheatley's only touch came on a seven-yard reception. Although the Raiders did not win the Super Bowl, Tyrone Wheatley was re-signed.

In <a href="2003%20NFL%20season">2003</a>, Wheatley reclaimed his role as the Raiders' leading rusher although Garner, the second leading rusher, continued to be the target of more passes and Crockett made it to the end zone as a rusher as often as Wheatley and Garner combined. Wheatley became the sixth person to lead the Raiders franchise in rushing yards three times (<a href="Clem%20Daniels">Clem Daniels</a>, <a href="Marv%20Hubbard">Marv Hubbard</a>, <a href="Mark%20van%20Eeghen">Mark van Eeghen</a>, <a href="Marcus%20Allen">Marcus Allen</a>, <a href="Napoleon%20Kaufman">Napoleon Kaufman</a>). The 2003 Raiders fell to 4–12 and had no 1,000-yard receivers or runners. Wheatley’s only 100-yard rushing game came on November 16 at home against the <a href="Minnesota%20Vikings">Minnesota Vikings</a>.

Wheatley's name and those of several of his teammates were found on the list of clients of the <a href="Bay%20Area%20Laboratory%20Co-operative">Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative</a> (BALCO) that had given performance-enhancing drugs to <a href="Marion%20Jones">Marion Jones</a> and others. As a result, he, and teammates <a href="Chris%20Hetherington">Chris Hetherington</a>, <a href="Dana%20Stubblefield">Dana Stubblefield</a>, and <a href="Chris%20Cooper%20%28football%20player%29">Chris Cooper</a> were called to testify before a 2003 federal <a href="grand%20jury">grand jury</a> investigating a laboratory that produces <a href="Dietary%20supplement">nutritional supplements</a>. <a href="Johnnie%20Morton">Johnnie Morton</a> was called before the same jury. Wheatley, Stubblefield, and Morton all declined to comment. This court appearance in the BALCO hearings was notable for Wheatley's assault of a <a href="freelance">freelance</a> photographer who attempted to take Wheatley's photo outside the <a href="Philip%20Burton%20Federal%20Building">Philip Burton Federal Building</a> just after Wheatley had informed the <a href="KNTV">KNTV</a> <a href="cameraman">cameraman</a> that he would sue anyone who took his picture.

Although Wheatley's 2003 performance had been modest compared with the other seasons that he led the Raiders in rushing (1999, 2000), it was sufficient to convince the Raiders that they did not need to re-sign the pass catching running back Charlie Garner for the <a href="2004%20NFL%20season">2004 season</a> with the new coach <a href="Norv%20Turner">Norv Turner</a>. The 2004 Raiders used a platoon of five runners (Wheatley, Crockett, <a href="Justin%20Fargas">Justin Fargas</a>, <a href="J.%20R.%20Redmond">J. R. Redmond</a> and <a href="Amos%20Zereou%C3%A9">Amos Zereoué</a>) who all rushed for between 100 and 500 yards and caught between 10 and 40 <a href="forward%20pass">passes</a>. Wheatley compiled his final 100-yard rushing game on September 26 in week 3 of the <a href="season%20%28sports%29">season</a> at home against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with 102 yards on 18 carries. This was the earliest point in the season Wheatley had rushed for 100 yards in a game as a professional. Wheatley's career ended in week 12 of the season on November 28, 2004 in a 25–24 win over the <a href="Denver%20Broncos">Denver Broncos</a> with an injury that was first described as an injured hamstring. The hamstring tear turned out to be acute. Wheatley had been under contract until 2009 with a 2005 base salary of $800,000 and a 2006 base salary of $2 million.

Unable to adequately rehabilitate his hamstring, Wheatley retired from the NFL and returned to <a href="Ann%20Arbor%2C%20Michigan">Ann Arbor, Michigan</a>. At the University of Michigan, in 2005, he volunteered as a track coach while finishing his <a href="Bachelor%27s%20degree">Bachelor's degree</a> in <a href="sport%20management">sport management</a>. In November 2006, Wheatley was hired at his <a href="alma%20mater">alma mater</a>, <a href="Robichaud%20High%20School">Robichaud High School</a>, as the track coach. After taking Robichaud to their first conference title he was also hired as the football coach. To prepare for his coaching duties he partook in Jon Gruden's NFL minority coaching internship by working with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as a NFL Minority coaching fellow during the 2006 training camp. As football coach in 2007, Wheatley started with a 6–1 record before facing the team's rival, the undefeated <a href="Inkster%20High%20School">Inkster High School</a>. Despite losing on the field to Inkster, the team was credited with a forfeit victory and compiled an 8–1 regular season record. The team achieved its first berth in 13 years in the <a href="Michigan%20High%20School%20Athletic%20Association">MHSAA</a> Class B playoffs, one year after going 0–9. The team won its first round playoff match against <a href="Annapolis%20High%20School%20%28Michigan%29">Dearborn Heights Annapolis High School</a> and lost its second to Milan High School to finish with a 9–2 record. The team last won the MHSAA title in 1990 during Wheatley's senior season with a 12–1 record. During Wheatley's absence the team was a state semifinalist in 1991 with a 10–2 record and made a playoff appearance in 1994. In addition to coaching, Wheatley has worked as an athletic trainer to about 30 clients.

In 2008, he joined John Fontes' coaching staff as an <a href="assistant%20coach">assistant coach</a> for <a href="Team%20Michigan">Team Michigan</a> in the <a href="All%20American%20Football%20League">All American Football League</a>. He was to serve as the running backs coach for the team in the league that planned to begin play in April 2008. However, the league never materialized. Wheatley interned as an NFL Minority coaching fellow with the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> during the summer of 2008 training camp. He also served at the Rising Stars Football Camp as an assistant instructor. In late August 2008, he became the assistant coach at <a href="Ohio%20Northern%20University">Ohio Northern University</a>, with responsibility for the team's running backs. After the end of Wheatley's coaching internship at the conclusion of the season, he was hired by <a href="Ron%20English%20%28American%20football%29">Ron English</a> as a running backs coach at <a href="Eastern%20Michigan%20University">Eastern Michigan University</a> for the 2009 season.

In February 2010, he was hired to replace Roger Harriott on <a href="Doug%20Marrone">Doug Marrone</a>'s staff at <a href="Syracuse%20University">Syracuse University</a>. In 2013, he left Syracuse, along with Marrone, to join the <a href="Buffalo%20Bills">Buffalo Bills</a>, Wheatley's first NFL coaching position.

In 2015, Tyrone decided to return to his alma mater and coach the running backs at the University of Michigan on the staff for the new Michigan head coach <a href="Jim%20Harbaugh">Jim Harbaugh</a>.

In January 2017, the Jacksonville Jaguars hired Wheatley as running backs coach to rejoin Marrone, who was hired as Jaguars' head coach. Wheatley along with several other assistant coaches and coordinators were fired by Marrone and the Jaguars after the 2018 season.. On February 6, 2019, Wheatley was named head coach of <a href="Morgan%20State%20Bears%20football">Morgan State Bears football</a>.

In addition to his guardianships, Wheatley and Kimberly have three sons and two daughters as of February 2010. Wheatley and his wife Kimberly, had their first child, Tyrone Jr., in 1997, and their second in late 1998. In 2012, Wheatley was selected for induction into the <a href="Michigan%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Michigan Sports Hall of Fame</a>.

SMS "Pommern" was one of five <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a>s built for the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">Kaiserliche Marine</a> between 1904 and 1906. Named after the <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>n province of <a href="Pomerania">Pomerania</a>, she was built at the <a href="AG%20Vulcan">AG Vulcan</a> yard at <a href="Stettin">Stettin</a>, Germany (now <a href="Szczecin">Szczecin</a>, Poland), where she was <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> on 22 March 1904 and <a href="ship%20launching">launched</a> on 2 December 1905. She was commissioned into the navy on 6 August 1907. The ship was armed with a battery of four <a href="28%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20gun">guns</a> and had a top speed of . The ships of her class were already outdated by the time they entered the service, being inferior in size, armor, firepower, and speed to the revolutionary new battleship .

After commissioning, "Pommern" was assigned to the <a href="II%20Battle%20Squadron">II Battle Squadron</a> of the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>, where she served throughout her peacetime career and the first two years of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. Before the war, the fleet was primarily occupied with cruises and extensive training exercises, developing strategic concepts for use in a future conflict. At the start of the war, "Pommern" and the rest of the II Battle Squadron were tasked with supporting the defenses of the <a href="German%20Bight">German Bight</a>, and were stationed at the mouth of the <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a>. They also participated in several fruitless sorties into the North Sea in attempts to lure out and destroy a portion of the British <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a>.

These offensive operations culminated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> on 31 May – 1 June 1916. She and her sisters briefly engaged the British battlecruisers commanded by <a href="David%20Beatty%2C%201st%20Earl%20Beatty">David Beatty</a> late on the first day, and "Pommern" was hit once by a shell from the battlecruiser . During the confused night actions in the early hours of 1 June, she was hit by one, or possibly two, torpedoes from the British destroyer , which detonated one of "Pommern"s gun <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a>. The resulting explosion broke the ship in half and killed the entire crew. "Pommern" was the only battleship of either side sunk during the battle.

The passage of the <a href="German%20Naval%20Laws">Second Naval Law</a> in 1900 under the direction of "<a href="Vizeadmiral">Vizeadmiral</a>" ("VAdm"—Vice Admiral) <a href="Alfred%20von%20Tirpitz">Alfred von Tirpitz</a> secured funding for the construction of twenty new battleships over the next seventeen years. The first group, the five s, were laid down in the early 1900s, and shortly thereafter work began on a follow-on design, which became the . The "Deutschland"-class ships were broadly similar to the "Braunschweig"s, featuring incremental improvements in armor protection. They also abandoned the <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s for the secondary battery guns, moving them back to traditional <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s to save weight. The British battleship —armed with ten 12-inch (30.5 cm) guns—was commissioned in December 1906. "Dreadnought"s revolutionary design rendered every capital ship of the German navy obsolete, including "Pommern".

"Pommern" was <a href="length%20overall">long overall</a>, with a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a <a href="draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of . She <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> at full loading. The ship was equipped with two heavy <a href="military%20mast">military mast</a>s and <a href="triple%20expansion%20engine">triple expansion engine</a>s that were rated at . She had a top speed of , though she significantly exceeded that speed on trials, being the fastest member of the class. Steam was provided by twelve <a href="Thornycroft%20boiler">Schulz-Thornycroft boilers</a>; three <a href="funnel%20%28ship%29">funnels</a> vented smoke from burning coal in the boilers. The ship had a fuel capacity of up to of coal. In addition to being the fastest ship of her class, "Pommern" was the most fuel efficient. At a cruising speed of , she could steam for . Her crew numbered 35 officers and 708 enlisted men.

"Pommern"s <a href="main%20battery">primary armament</a> consisted of four <a href="28%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20gun">SK L/40</a> guns in two twin turrets. Her <a href="battleship%20secondary%20armament">secondary battery</a> was fourteen <a href="17%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20gun">SK L/40</a> guns mounted in casemates and twenty <a href="8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/45%20naval%20gun">SK L/45 naval gun</a>s in pivot mounts. The ship was also armed with six <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, all submerged in the hull. One was in the bow, one in the stern, and four on the <a href="broadside">broadside</a>. <a href="Krupp%20cemented%20armor">Krupp cemented armor</a> protected the ship. Her <a href="armored%20belt">armored belt</a> was thick in the central portion, where it protected her <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a> and machinery spaces, while thinner plating covered the ends of the hull. Her <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">main-deck</a> armor was thick. The main battery turrets had of armor plating.

"Pommern" was ordered under the contract name "O", as a new addition to the fleet's numerical strength. She was laid down on 22 March 1904 at the <a href="AG%20Vulcan">AG Vulcan</a> dockyard in <a href="Stettin">Stettin</a>. She was originally scheduled to be launched on 19 November 1905, but the water level in the harbor was too low. As a result, the ship could not be launched until 2 December. The <a href="Oberpr%C3%A4sident">Oberpräsident</a> (High Commissioner) of <a href="Pommern">Pommern</a>, <a href="Helmuth%20von%20Maltzahn">Helmuth von Maltzahn</a>, gave the launching speech. In July 1907 "Pommern" was transferred to <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a> where she had her main battery of four 28 cm (11 in) guns installed. She was commissioned for trials on 6 August; during her speed run, she reached , which made her the fastest pre-dreadnought battleship in the world.

"Pommern" was assigned to the <a href="II%20Battle%20Squadron">II Battle Squadron</a> of the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> alongside her sisters, replacing the battleship , though she was not fully ready for active duty until 11 November. "Pommern" participated in fleet maneuvers in February 1908 in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> and more fleet training off <a href="Helgoland">Helgoland</a> in May–June. In July, "Pommern" and the rest of the fleet sailed into the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> to conduct a major training cruise. Prince Heinrich had pressed for such a cruise the previous year, arguing that it would prepare the fleet for overseas operations and would break up the monotony of training in German waters, though tensions with Britain over the developing <a href="Anglo-German%20naval%20arms%20race">Anglo-German naval arms race</a> were high. The fleet departed Kiel on 17 July, passed through the <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20Canal">Kaiser Wilhelm Canal</a> to the North Sea, and continued on to the Atlantic. The fleet returned to Germany on 13 August, and the annual autumn maneuvers followed from 27 August to 12 September.Later that year, the fleet toured coastal German cities as part of an effort to increase public support for naval expenditures.

The next year—1909—followed much the same pattern. Another cruise into the Atlantic was conducted from 7 July to 1 August, and while on the way back to Germany, the High Seas Fleet was received by the British <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> in <a href="Spithead">Spithead</a>. Late in the year, "VAdm" <a href="Henning%20von%20Holtzendorff">Henning von Holtzendorff</a> became the commander of the High Seas Fleet. His tenure as fleet commander was marked by strategic experimentation, owing to the increased threat the latest underwater weapons posed, and because the new s were too wide to pass through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. Accordingly, the fleet was transferred from Kiel to Wilhelmshaven on 1 April 1910. In May 1910, the fleet conducted training maneuvers in the <a href="Kattegat">Kattegat</a>, between Norway and Denmark. These were in accordance with Holtzendorff's strategy, which envisioned drawing the Royal Navy into the narrow waters in the Kattegat. The annual summer cruise went to Norway, and was followed by fleet training, during which another fleet review was held in <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a> on 29 August. A training cruise into the Baltic followed at the end of the year.

In March 1911, the fleet conducted exercises in the <a href="Skagerrak">Skagerrak</a> and Kattegat. "Pommern" and the rest of the fleet received British and American naval squadrons in Kiel in June and July. The year's autumn maneuvers were confined to the Baltic and the Kattegat. Another fleet review was held during the exercises for a visiting Austro-Hungarian delegation that included <a href="Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand">Archduke Franz Ferdinand</a> and Admiral <a href="Rudolf%20Montecuccoli">Rudolf Montecuccoli</a>. In mid-1912, due to the <a href="Agadir%20Crisis">Agadir Crisis</a>, the summer cruise only went into the Baltic to avoid exposing the fleet during the period of heightened tension with Britain and France. "Pommern" took part in several celebrations commemorating the fiftieth anniversaries of events from the <a href="Second%20Schleswig%20War">Second Schleswig War</a>. The first, on 17 March, took place at <a href="Swinem%C3%BCnde">Swinemünde</a>, on the anniversary of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jasmund%20%281864%29">Battle of Jasmund</a> participated in ceremonies at <a href="Sonderburg">Sonderburg</a> on 2 May 1914 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dybb%C3%B8l">Battle of Dybbøl</a>.

In July 1914, about two weeks after the <a href="Assassination%20of%20Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand%20of%20Austria">assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand</a> in <a href="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a>, "Pommern" was with the High Seas Fleet during its annual summer cruise to Norway. As a result of rising international tensions, the cruise was cut short and the German fleet was back in Wilhelmshaven by 29 July. At midnight on 4 August, the United Kingdom declared war on Germany for violating Belgium's neutrality. "Pommern" remained with the High Seas Fleet throughout the first two years of the naval war. At the outbreak of war, the German command deployed the II Squadron in the <a href="German%20Bight">German Bight</a> to defend Germany's coast from a major attack from the Royal Navy that the Germans presumed was imminent. "Pommern" and her squadron mates were stationed in the mouth of the <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a> to support the vessels on patrol duty in the Bight.

Once it became clear that the British would not attack the High Seas Fleet, the Germans began a series of operations designed to lure out part of the numerically superior British <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a> and destroy it. The German navy was aiming to force a decisive battle in the southern portion of the North Sea after achieving a rough equality of forces. "Pommern" and the rest of the II Battle Squadron then rejoined the High Seas Fleet as part of the battleship support for the battlecruisers in the <a href="I%20Scouting%20Group">I Scouting Group</a> that <a href="Raid%20on%20Scarborough%2C%20Hartlepool%20and%20Whitby">bombarded Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby</a> on 15–16 December 1914. The main fleet acted as distant support for "<a href="Konteradmiral">Konteradmiral</a>" ("KAdm"—Rear Admiral) <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz von Hipper</a>'s battlecruiser squadron while it raided the coastal towns. On the evening of 15 December, the fleet came to within of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. However, skirmishes between the rival <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> screens in the darkness convinced the German fleet commander, "VAdm" <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Ingenohl">Friedrich von Ingenohl</a>, that the entire Grand Fleet was deployed before him. Under orders from Wilhelm II to avoid battle if victory was not certain, von Ingenohl broke off the engagement and turned the battlefleet back towards Germany.

Two fruitless fleet advances followed on 17–18 and 21–23 April 1915. A third took place on 17–18 May, and a fourth occurred on 23–24 October. On 24–25 April 1916, "Pommern" and her sisters joined the dreadnoughts of the High Seas Fleet to support the battlecruisers, which were again tasked with conducting a raid of the English coast. While en route to the target, a <a href="naval%20mine">mine</a> damaged the battlecruiser . She was detached to return home, and the rest of the ships continued with the mission. Due to poor visibility, the battlecruisers conducted a brief <a href="Bombardment%20of%20Yarmouth%20and%20Lowestoft">bombardment of the ports of Yarmouth and Lowestoft</a>. The operation was quickly called off, preventing the British fleet from being able to intervene.

"VAdm" <a href="Reinhard%20Scheer">Reinhard Scheer</a>, the new commander of the High Seas Fleet, immediately planned another foray into the North Sea, but the damage to "Seydlitz" delayed the operation until the end of May. On 31 May, at 02:00 <a href="Central%20European%20Time">CET</a>, Hipper's battlecruisers steamed out towards the Skagerrak, followed by the rest of the High Seas Fleet an hour and a half later. "Pommern" remained assigned to the II Battle Squadron, which was positioned at the rear of the German line and under the command of "Kadm" . During the "Run to the North," Scheer ordered the fleet to pursue the British V Battle Squadron at top speed. The slower "Deutschland"-class ships could not keep up with the faster dreadnoughts and quickly fell behind. By 19:30, the Grand Fleet had arrived on the scene and confronted Scheer with significant numerical superiority. The German fleet was severely hampered by the presence of the slower "Deutschland"-class ships; if Scheer ordered an immediate turn towards Germany, he would have to sacrifice the slower ships to make good his escape.

Scheer decided to reverse the course of the fleet with the "Gefechtskehrtwendung", a maneuver that required every unit in the German line to turn 180° simultaneously. As a result of their having fallen behind, the ships of the II Battle Squadron could not conform to the new course following the turn, so "Pommern" and the other five ships of the squadron were located on the disengaged side of the German line. Mauve considered moving his ships to the rear of the line, astern of the III Battle Squadron dreadnoughts, but decided against it when he realized the movement would interfere with the maneuvering of Hipper's battlecruisers. Instead, he attempted to place his ships at the head of the line.

Later in the evening of the first day of the battle, the hard-pressed battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group were being pursued by their British opponents. "Pommern" and the other so-called "five-minute ships" came to their aid by steaming in between the opposing battlecruiser squadrons. "Pommern" could not make out a target in the darkness, but several of her sisters could, though their shooting was ineffective. The British battlecruisers scored several hits on the German ships, including one on "Pommern" by a shell fired by , forcing her to haul out of line. Mauve ordered an <a href="Boxing%20the%20compass">8-point</a> turn to the south to disengage from the British, and they did not follow.

At 3:10 on the morning of 1 June, "Pommern" was torpedoed by the British destroyer . At least one torpedo, and possibly a second, struck the ship, detonating one of the 17 cm ammunition magazines. A tremendous explosion broke the ship in half. The stern capsized and remained afloat for at least 20 minutes with her propellers jutting into the air. , the ship directly astern of "Pommern", was forced to haul out of line to avoid the wreck. "Pommern"s entire crew of 839 officers and enlisted men were killed when the ship sank. She was the only battleship, pre-dreadnought or dreadnought, in either fleet to be sunk at Jutland; her loss, coupled with the vulnerabilities of the surviving pre-dreadnoughts, prompted Scheer to leave them behind during the <a href="Action%20of%2019%20August%201916">sortie of 18–19 August 1916</a>. The ship's bow ornament, which had been removed at the outbreak of war in July 1914, is preserved at the <a href="Laboe%20Naval%20Memorial">Laboe Naval Memorial</a>.

Old Dan Tucker

"Old Dan Tucker", also known as "Ole Dan Tucker", "Dan Tucker", and other variants, is an <a href="American%20popular%20music">American popular song</a>. Its origins remain obscure; the tune may have come from oral tradition, and the words may have been written by songwriter and performer <a href="Dan%20Emmett">Dan Emmett</a>. The <a href="blackface">blackface</a> troupe the <a href="Virginia%20Minstrels">Virginia Minstrels</a> popularized "Old Dan Tucker" in 1843, and it quickly became a <a href="minstrel%20show">minstrel</a> hit, behind only "<a href="Miss%20Lucy%20Long">Miss Lucy Long</a>" and "<a href="Mary%20Blane">Mary Blane</a>" in popularity during the <a href="antebellum%20era">antebellum</a> period. "Old Dan Tucker" entered the <a href="folk%20music">folk vernacular</a> around the same time. Today it is a <a href="bluegrass%20music">bluegrass</a> and <a href="country%20music">country music</a> standard. It is no. 390 in the <a href="Roud%20Folk%20Song%20Index">Roud Folk Song Index</a>.

The first <a href="sheet%20music">sheet music</a> edition of "Old Dan Tucker", published in 1843, is a song of boasts and <a href="nonsense">nonsense</a> in the vein of previous minstrel hits such as "<a href="Jump%20Jim%20Crow">Jump Jim Crow</a>" and "<a href="Gumbo%20Chaff">Gumbo Chaff</a>". In exaggerated <a href="African%20American%20Vernacular%20English">Black Vernacular English</a>, the lyrics tell of Dan Tucker's exploits in a strange town, where he fights, gets drunk, overeats, and breaks other social <a href="taboo">taboo</a>s. Minstrel troupes freely added and removed verses, and folk singers have since added hundreds more. Parodies and political versions are also known.

The song falls into the idiom of previous minstrel music, relying on <a href="rhythm">rhythm</a> and text declamation as its primary motivation. Its <a href="melody">melody</a> is simple and the <a href="harmony">harmony</a> little developed. Nevertheless, contemporary critics found the song more pleasant than previous minstrel fare. Musicologist Dale Cockrell argues that the song represents a transition between early minstrel music and the more European-style songs of minstrelsy's later years.

"Old Dan Tucker" as originally published exemplifies the masculine boasting songs that predominated in early <a href="minstrel%20show">minstrelsy</a>. Modern analysts emphasize the song's rawness, <a href="racism">racism</a>, and disdain for social taboos. In ersatz <a href="African%20American%20Vernacular%20English">Black Vernacular English</a>, the song uses short, active words such as "runnin" and "cryin", to portray Dan Tucker as a rough-and-ready <a href="black%20people">black</a> man in the mold of <a href="Jump%20Jim%20Crow">Jim Crow</a>, <a href="Gumbo%20Chaff">Gumbo Chaff</a>, and ultimately the <a href="tall%20tale">tall tale</a> <a href="frontiersman">frontiersman</a>:

Tucker is an animalistic character, driven by sex, violence, and strong drink. He is ugly, unrefined, and unintelligent, even infantilized. As a stranger in town, his devil-may-care actions show his problems with or ambivalence to adapting to local <a href="mores">mores</a>. More broadly, Tucker's disdain for social <a href="norm%20%28sociology%29">norms</a> allows the song to send up respectable <a href="middle%20class">middle class</a> American society, as evidenced by the final verse:

Other verses appear that do not go along with the main narrative. Their lines seem to be confused jabber, due to the unfamiliar slang and products of the time. Perhaps it was written to extend the rhyme scheme. The third verse is one example:

Dan Tucker is both the teller and subject of the story. Verses 1, 3, and 5 of the 1843 edition are in the <a href="grammatical%20person">first person</a>, whereas verses 2, 4, and 7 are in the third. This reflects the song's intended performance by an entire minstrel troupe. The lead minstrel played Tucker and began the song, but backup singers took over at times to allow Tucker to act out the scenario, dance, and do another comedy bit. There was probably an element of competition to the various dance and music solos. The third-person verses also allowed for commentary to suggest to the audience how they were to judge the character and his antics.

Individual companies probably selectively performed verses from the song or added new ones. For example, the Virginia Serenaders added verses about the <a href="Irish%20people">Irish</a>, <a href="Dutch%20people">Dutch</a>, and <a href="French%20people">French</a>. At least four versions of the song were published with different lyrics during the 19th century. A <a href="parody">parody</a> called "<a href="Clar%20de%20Track">Clar de Track</a>" appears in some playbills and songsters.

"Old Dan Tucker" entered <a href="folklore%20of%20the%20United%20States">American folklore</a> soon after it was written. Its simple and malleable nature means that singers may begin or end it at any point or invent new verses on the spot. Hundreds of folk verses have been recorded. This is a common folk variant:

A common chorus variant goes:

For decades "Old Dan Tucker" was used as part of a <a href="folk%20dance">dancing</a> game. The players formed a ring, and one man moved to the center. He selected women to swing around according to the lyrics:

The third woman chosen then became his new partner, and her old partner now took the role of "Old Dan".

These folk versions can be quite ribald. This one, recalled by a man from his boyhood in <a href="Benton%20County%2C%20Arkansas">Benton County, Arkansas</a>, in the 1910s, is one example:

The above version was recorded by <a href="Oscar%20Brand">Oscar Brand</a>, with addition of the following verses.

Another version, sung by Charles Edward Carpenter—a Lawrenceburg, Tennessee business man and World War II Veteran (born in Crewstown, TN)—to his children and grandchildren in Middle Tennessee during the mid- to late 1900s speaks of Old Dan Tucker's love of a hard drink. The last line appears to have been sung in the first person ("Oh my goodness, what'll I do?):

"Old Dan Tucker" entered the folklore of <a href="history%20of%20slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slaves</a> as well. This version from <a href="Orange%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">Orange County, North Carolina</a>, was recorded in the 1850s:

It has been suggested that "died with a toothache in his heel" could be a reference to <a href="reactive%20arthritis">reactive arthritis</a>.

The original "Old Dan Tucker" and most folk variants are not political in nature. However, as early as 1844, the <a href="Hutchinson%20Family%20Singers">Hutchinson Family Singers</a> were performing "Get off the Track!" to its tune, billed as "A song for emancipation" One verse and the chorus say:

That same year, supporters of <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a> at a <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig</a> rally sang a version that makes references to Clay ("Ole Kentucky"), <a href="Martin%20Van%20Buren">Martin Van Buren</a>, and <a href="James%20Buchanan">James Buchanan</a>:

[{poemquote|The people's fav'rite, Henry Clay, is now the 'fashion' of the day;
And let the track be dry or mucky, we'll stake our pile on Ole Kentucky.

Another Clay version has the following lyrics (which also has the advantage of explaining the pronunciation of Clay's vice presidential candidate):

In 1856, supporters of <a href="John%20C.%20Fr%C3%A9mont">John C. Frémont</a>'s run for the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a> nomination adopted the tune as his <a href="campaign%20song">campaign song</a> with the changed refrain "Get out the way, old Buchanan". <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a>'s campaign song for the 1900 <a href="Democratic%20National%20Convention">Democratic National Convention</a> in <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City, Missouri</a>, changed the lyrics to say:

A version popular during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> adds references to <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>:

"Old Dan Tucker" is a <a href="breakdown%20%28music%29">breakdown</a>, a <a href="dance%20music">dance song</a> wherein the rhythmic accent falls on the second and fourth beats rather than on the third. The song is largely Anglo-American in nature, although it has black influences. Its repetitive melodic <a href="idiom">idiom</a> matches that of earlier minstrel standards, such as "Jump Jim Crow", "<a href="Coal%20Black%20Rose">Coal Black Rose</a>", and "<a href="Turkey%20in%20the%20Straw">Old Zip Coon</a>".

The song consists of 28 <a href="bar%20%28music%29">bars</a>. It begins with a boisterous eight-bar introduction. Four bars follow to frame the <a href="coda%20%28music%29">coda</a>. The remainder consists of sixteen bars with lyrics, half devoted to <a href="Verse%20%28poetry%29">verse</a>, and half to <a href="refrain">refrain</a>. Each <a href="phrase%20%28music%29">phrase</a> gives way directly to the next with no <a href="rest%20%28music%29">rests</a> between sections.

<a href="Rhythm">Rhythm</a> is perhaps the most important component of "Old Dan Tucker". It begins with a cadenced introduction and little melody. Even when the tune begins in earnest, it is flat and non-harmonized and does little more than provide a beat on which words are uttered. The <a href="refrain">refrain</a> is <a href="syncopation">syncopated</a> in a way that had only previously been used in the minstrel song "Old Zip Coon". The intense rhythm on the line "Get out the way!" generates a forward momentum and is answered by instruments in one example of the song's black-influenced <a href="call%20and%20response%20%28music%29">call and response</a>.

"Old Dan Tucker" was, of course, intended for stage performance. The verses are not only to be played but also acted out and danced to. Minstrels could begin leaping about at the introduction and coda, beginning the full music at the vocal section. Performers probably included instrumental versions of the chorus while they played, a rare practice in early minstrelsy.

<a href="Musicology">Musicologist</a> Dale Cockrell argues that "Old Dan Tucker" represents a bridge between the percussive <a href="blackface">blackface</a> songs of the 1830s and the more refined compositions of songwriters such as <a href="Stephen%20Foster">Stephen Foster</a>. Cockrell says that, unlike previous minstrel songs, "Old Dan Tucker" is meant for more than just dancing; its tune is developed enough to stand on its own. Contemporary critics certainly noticed the difference. Y. S. Nathanson called it "the best of what I have denominated the ancient negro ballads. The melody is far superior to anything that had preceded it." Nathanson compared the song to works by <a href="Gaetano%20Donizetti">Gaetano Donizetti</a> and <a href="Daniel%20Auber">Daniel Auber</a>.

The origin of the music of "Old Dan Tucker" has always been obscure, and no <a href="sheet%20music">sheet music</a> edition from 1843, the year of its first publication, names a composer. The first performance of the tune (but not lyrics) may have happened as early as 1841. The song has been alleged to refer to the notorious <a href="Daniel%20Tucker%20%28Governor%29">Daniel Tucker</a> (1575-1625) of <a href="Jamestown%20Colony">Jamestown Colony</a>, <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, and <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>. The music may be from the oral tradition or may have been a product of collaboration.

"Old Dan Tucker" has been credited to at least three different songwriters: <a href="Dan%20Emmett">Dan Emmett</a>, J. R. Jenkins, and <a href="Henry%20Russell%20%28musician%29">Henry Russell</a>. In his old age, Emmett related the traditional story to his biographer, <a href="H.%20Ogden%20Wintermute">H. Ogden Wintermute</a>: "I composed "Old Dan Tucker" in 1830 or 1831, when I was fifteen or sixteen years old." The biography says that Emmett first played the song in public at a performance by a group of traveling entertainers. They lacked a fiddle player, and the local innkeeper suggested young Emmett to fill in. Emmett played "Old Dan Tucker" to the troupe manager's liking, and he debuted on the <a href="Mount%20Vernon%2C%20Ohio">Mount Vernon, Ohio</a>, village green in blackface to perform the song on the <a href="Independence%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">Fourth of July</a>. Wintermute says that the name Dan Tucker is a combination of Emmett's own name and that of his dog. However, there is no evidence for any of this. Instead, Emmett may merely have written the words. Even these seem to partially derive from an earlier minstrel song called "<a href="Walk%20Along%20John">Walk Along John</a>" or "Oh, Come Along John", first published in various songsters in the early 1840s. Some verses have clear echoes in versions of "Old Dan Tucker":

The <a href="Charles%20Keith">Charles Keith</a> <a href="publishing">company</a> published "Old Dan Tucker" in <a href="Boston%2C%20Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a>, in 1843. The sheet music credits words to Dan Emmett but says that the song is from "Old Dan Emmit's Original Banjo Melodies". The lack of attribution of the melody may be another sign that Emmett did not write it.

A story dating to at least 1965 says that "Old Dan Tucker" was written by slaves about a man named <a href="Daniel%20Tucker%20%28minister%29">Daniel Tucker</a> who lived in <a href="Elbert%20County%2C%20Georgia">Elbert County, Georgia</a>. Tucker was a farmer, ferryman, and minister who appears in records from the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The story, as related by Mrs. Guy Rucker, the great-great-granddaughter of one of Tucker's neighbors, claims that Tucker became quite well liked by the slaves in his area through his ministry to them.

According to this interpretation, the lyrics address Tucker directly. The chorus, "You're too late to get your supper" is a kindhearted taunt to a man who often arrived after dark, forcing his hosts to scrape up a meal for him. The song's occasional lewdness is explained by the natural impromptu nature of its supposed origin.

"Old Dan Tucker" does show evidence of black influence. For example, bizarre imagery in folk versions of the song (e.g., "toothache in his heel") may be a sign of legitimate black input (or of someone poking fun of slaves who had an incomplete knowledge of English). "Old Dan Tucker" most closely resembles <a href="music%20of%20Africa">African music</a> in its call-and-response refrain.

Daniel Tucker was buried in Elbert County in 1818. The Elbert County Chamber of Commerce today promotes his grave as a <a href="tourist%20attraction">tourist attraction</a> due to his possible connection with the character from the song.

In December 1842 and January 1843, Dan Emmett portrayed the character Old Dan Tucker in solo and duo performances; the playbills do not indicate whether he included the song in his act. The <a href="Virginia%20Minstrels">Virginia Minstrels</a> probably made "Old Dan Tucker" a regular part of their show beginning with their first performance at the <a href="Bowery%20Amphitheatre">Bowery Amphitheatre</a> on February 6, 1843. Their minstrel show also included a comic scene loosely based on the song, "Dan Tucker on Horseback", about a black riding master. The piece starred <a href="Richard%20Pelham">Richard Pelham</a> in the title role and <a href="Frank%20Brower">Frank Brower</a> as a black clown. "Old Dan Tucker" did not appear on a Virginia Minstrels playbill until a March 7 and 8 performance at <a href="List%20of%20Masonic%20buildings%20in%20the%20United%20States%23Boston%20Masonic%20Temple">Boston's Masonic Temple</a>. There, the playbill described it as "OLD DAN TUCKER, a Virginian Refrain, in which is described the ups and downs of Negro life." As early as February 15, Emmett billed himself as "Old Dan Emmett".

By the end of March, "Old Dan Tucker" was a hit, and it quickly became the Virginia Minstrels' most popular song. Robert Winans found the song on 49% of the minstrel playbills he surveyed from the 1843–1847 period (behind only "<a href="Miss%20Lucy%20Long">Miss Lucy Long</a>"), and research by musicologist William J. Mahar suggests that it was behind only "<a href="Mary%20Blane">Mary Blane</a>" and "Lucy Long" in its frequency of publication in antebellum songsters. The next year, Dan Tucker returned in the popular "<a href="Ole%20Bull%20and%20Old%20Dan%20Tucker">Ole Bull and Old Dan Tucker</a>", which pits him against Ole Bull in a contest of skill. Sequels such as "<a href="De%20New%20Ole%20Dan%20Tucker">De New Ole Dan Tucker</a>" and "<a href="Old%20Dan%20Tucker%27s%20Wedding">Old Dan Tucker's Wedding</a>" followed. Other companies adopted Tucker for comedy sketches, such as burlesques of "<a href="La%20sonnambula">La sonnambula</a>" by <a href="Buckley%27s%20Serenaders">Buckley's Serenaders</a> in 1850 and <a href="Sanford%27s%20Opera%20Troupe">Sanford's Opera Troupe</a> in 1853.

The song became so identified with Emmett and the Virginia Minstrels that it became part of their foundation myth. <a href="Billy%20Whitlock">Billy Whitlock</a> and <a href="George%20B.%20Wooldridge">George B. Wooldridge</a> both claimed that the troupe members played "Old Dan Tucker" in their first impromptu performance together:

... as if by accident, each one picked up his tools and joined in a chorus of "Old Dan Tucker," while Emmett was playing and singing. It went well, and they repeated it without saying a word. Each did his best, and such a rattling of the principal and original instruments in a minstrel band was never heard before.

Emmett repeated this story in the May 19, 1877, "<a href="New%20York%20Clipper">New York Clipper</a>", although other details changed. The press began to refer to Emmett as "Ole Dan Tucker", and Emmett eventually adopted the nickname. The Virginia Minstrels sometimes went by "Ole Dan Tucker and Co." They were called "Old Dan Tucker & Co.," either by themselves or by the press, as early as February 16, 1843.

The song's disdain for the customs of the <a href="upper%20class">upper class</a>es hit a chord with <a href="working%20class">working class</a> audiences. On January 28, 1843, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Sporting%20Whip">The New York Sporting Whip</a>" reported that the song had been adopted by a <a href="Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</a>, street <a href="gang">gang</a> called the Hallow Guards. As their leader, Stovepipe Bill, led them against a military raid, he sang the verses followed by the gang singing the chorus. Two years later, "<a href="The%20Knickerbocker">The Knickerbocker</a>" remarked, "At this present moment, a certain ubiquitous person seems to be in the way of the whole people of these United States simultaneously." Nathanson claimed that "Old Dan Tucker" had "been sung, perhaps, oftener than any melody ever written."

In 1871, 28 years after its first published edition, "<a href="Board%20and%20Trade">Board and Trade</a>" listed editions of "Old Dan Tucker" in print from seven different publishers. The song had by default fallen into the <a href="public%20domain">public domain</a>. In later decades, "Old Dan Tucker" became a standard of <a href="Bluegrass%20music">bluegrass</a> and <a href="country%20music">country music</a>, with recordings by such artists as <a href="Fiddlin%27%20John%20Carson">Fiddlin' John Carson</a>, <a href="Uncle%20Dave%20Macon">Uncle Dave Macon</a>, <a href="Pete%20Seeger">Pete Seeger</a>, and <a href="Gid%20Tanner">Gid Tanner</a> and his <a href="Skillet%20Lickers">Skillet Lickers</a>. It is referred to in <a href="John%20Steinbeck">John Steinbeck</a>'s novel <a href="The%20Grapes%20of%20Wrath">The Grapes of Wrath</a>. More recently, rock musician <a href="Bruce%20Springsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a> made a . Children's music collections frequently feature the song and it has been covered by children's group <a href="The%20Wiggles">The Wiggles</a> with Australian country performer <a href="Troy%20Cassar-Daley">Troy Cassar-Daley</a>. In <a href="Joel%20Chandler%20Harris">Joel Chandler Harris</a>'s <a href="Uncle%20Remus">Uncle Remus</a>, it appears in the context of powerless Crawfish trying to be heard in an assembly of animals, and Harris writes, "but dey might ez well er sung Ole Dan Tucker ter a harrycane." In the 1935 novel "<a href="Little%20House%20on%20the%20Prairie%20%28novel%29">Little House on the Prairie</a>" by <a href="Laura%20Ingalls%20Wilder">Laura Ingalls Wilder</a>, the character Mr. Edwards sings the song as his trademark; accordingly, the <a href="Little%20House%20on%20the%20Prairie%20%28TV%20series%29">"Little House on the Prairie" television series</a> from the 1970s and 1980s uses the song as a <a href="leitmotif">leitmotif</a> for the character.

Oryzomys couesi

Oryzomys couesi, also known as Coues' rice rat, is a <a href="List%20of%20semiaquatic%20tetrapods">semiaquatic</a> <a href="rodent">rodent</a> in the family <a href="Cricetidae">Cricetidae</a> occurring from southernmost Texas through Mexico and Central America into northwestern Colombia. It is usually found in wet habitats, such as marshes, but also lives in drier forests and <a href="shrubland">shrubland</a>s. Weighing about , "O. couesi" is a medium-sized to large rat. The coarse fur is buff to reddish above and white to <a href="wikt%3Abuff">buff</a> below. The hindfeet show some specializations for life in the water, such as reduced <a href="ungual%20tufts">ungual tufts</a> of hair around the digits. It has 56 <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s. There is much geographic variation in size, proportions, color, and skull features. "Oryzomys couesi" is active during the night and builds nests of vegetation that are suspended among reeds about above the ground. It is an excellent swimmer and dives well, but can also climb in vegetation. An <a href="omnivore">omnivore</a>, it eats both plant and animal food, including seeds and insects. It breeds throughout the year; females give birth to about four young after a pregnancy of 21 to 28 days. The species may be infected by several different <a href="parasite">parasite</a>s and by two <a href="hantavirus">hantavirus</a>es.

The species was first described in 1877, the first of many related species from the region described until the 1910s. In 1918, <a href="Edward%20Alphonso%20Goldman">Edward Alphonso Goldman</a> consolidated most into the single species "Oryzomys couesi" and in 1960 <a href="Raymond%20Hall">Raymond Hall</a> united this <a href="taxon">taxon</a> with its United States relative, the <a href="marsh%20rice%20rat">marsh rice rat</a> ("O. palustris"), into a single widespread species; subsequently, many related, localized species retained by Goldman were also included in this taxon. After studies of the contact zone in Texas, where "O. couesi" and the marsh rice rat meet, were published in 1979 and underscored the distinctness of the two, they were again regarded as separate. Since then, some of the peripheral forms of the group, such as "<a href="Oryzomys%20antillarum">Oryzomys antillarum</a>" from Jamaica and "<a href="Oryzomys%20peninsulae">Oryzomys peninsulae</a>" from the <a href="Baja%20California%20Peninsula">Baja California Peninsula</a>, have been reinstated as species. Nevertheless, "O. couesi" as currently constituted is likely a composite of several species; a 2010 study, using <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> data, found evidence to recognize separate species from the Pacific and eastern sides of the distribution of "O. couesi" and two additional species from <a href="Panama">Panama</a> and <a href="Costa%20Rica">Costa Rica</a>. Generally, "Oryzomys couesi" is common and of no conservation concern, and it is even considered a plague species in places, but some populations are threatened.

"Oryzomys couesi" and at least six more narrowly distributed species with peripheral distributions together form the "O. couesi" group within the genus "<a href="Oryzomys">Oryzomys</a>". The eighth species of the genus, the <a href="marsh%20rice%20rat">marsh rice rat</a> ("O. palustris") is the only member of its own group (unless western populations are <a href="biological%20classification">classified</a> as a separate species, "O. texensis"). "Oryzomys" previously included many other species, which were reclassified in various studies culminating in contributions by Marcelo Weksler and coworkers in 2006 that removed more than forty species from the genus. All are placed in the tribe <a href="Oryzomyini">Oryzomyini</a> ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily <a href="Sigmodontinae">Sigmodontinae</a> of the family <a href="Cricetidae">Cricetidae</a>, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.

<a href="Edward%20Alston">Edward Alston</a> first described "Oryzomys couesi" in 1877, using three specimens from Mexico and Guatemala. He named the animal "Hesperomys couesi", placing it in the now-defunct genus "<a href="Hesperomys">Hesperomys</a>", and noted similarities to the <a href="marsh%20rice%20rat">marsh rice rat</a> (then called "Hesperomys palustris") and two species now placed in "<a href="Tylomys">Tylomys</a>". The <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a>, "couesi", honors American naturalist <a href="Elliott%20Coues">Elliott Coues</a>, who had done much work on North American rodents. In 1893, <a href="Oldfield%20Thomas">Oldfield Thomas</a> wrote that the species, by then placed in the genus "<a href="Oryzomys">Oryzomys</a>" as "Oryzomys couesi", had caused much confusion about its identity, because the three specimens (one from <a href="Cob%C3%A1n">Cobán</a>, Guatemala, and two from Mexico) used by Alston in fact belonged to two or three different species. He restricted the name "couesi" to the animal from Guatemala, and introduced the new name "Oryzomys fulgens" for one of the Mexican animals. Several other related species were described from the early 1890s onwards and in 1901 <a href="Clinton%20Hart%20Merriam">Clinton Hart Merriam</a> united many of those into a "palustris-mexicanus" group of species, which also included the marsh rice rat.

<a href="Edward%20Alphonso%20Goldman">Edward Alphonso Goldman</a> revised North American "Oryzomys" in 1918 and consolidated many forms into a single species "Oryzomys couesi", with ten <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> distributed from southern <a href="Texas">Texas</a> and western Mexico south to Costa Rica. He placed it in an "Oryzomys palustris" group with the marsh rice rat and several species with more limited distributions, which he regarded as related to "O. couesi" but distinctive enough to be classified as separate species. In the 1930s, a few more forms related to "O. couesi" were described. As then recognized, the ranges of the marsh rice rat, a United States species, and "Oryzomys couesi" meet in southern Texas. In 1960, <a href="Raymond%20Hall">Raymond Hall</a> reviewed specimens from this contact zone and found no grounds on which to separate the two species; thus, he reduced "O. couesi" to a subspecies of the marsh rice rat. Other workers continued this lumping and by 1971 all other species Goldman had placed in the "O. palustris" group were classified under the marsh rice rat, together with "Oryzomys azuerensis" from Panama, described as a species in 1937.

Additional studies of the "palustris–couesi" contact zone in Texas published in 1979, using more specimens and characters, indicated that the two species are in fact easily distinguishable there; therefore, "O. couesi" has since been regarded as a species distinct from the marsh rice rat. Afterward, some of the other forms synonymized under "O. couesi" or "O. palustris" were resurrected as separate species—"<a href="Oryzomys%20nelsoni">Oryzomys nelsoni</a>" from the <a href="Mar%C3%ADas%20Islands">Marías Islands</a>, western Mexico, and "<a href="Oryzomys%20antillarum">Oryzomys antillarum</a>" from Jamaica. In 2009, <a href="Michael%20Carleton">Michael Carleton</a> and Joaquin Arroyo-Cabrales reviewed western Mexican "Oryzomys", reaffirmed the distinctness of "O. nelsoni", and reinstated "<a href="Oryzomys%20peninsulae">O. peninsulae</a>" from the tip of the <a href="Baja%20California%20Peninsula">Baja California Peninsula</a> and "<a href="Oryzomys%20albiventer">O. albiventer</a>" from interior Mexico as species. Still, "O. couesi" included 22 <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonyms</a>, and Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales wrote that further research on "O. couesi" and related species would certainly result in the recognition of additional species.

A 2010 study by Delton Hanson and colleagues used DNA sequence data from the <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial</a> gene <a href="cytochrome%20b">cytochrome "b"</a> ("Cytb") and two <a href="nuclear%20DNA">nuclear</a> markers, <a href="exon">exon</a> 1 of the <a href="interphotoreceptor%20retinoid-binding%20protein">interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein</a> gene ("Rbp3") and <a href="intron">intron</a> 2 of <a href="alcohol%20dehydrogenase">alcohol dehydrogenase</a> gene 1 ("Adh1-I2") to study relationships among populations of the marsh rice rat and "O. couesi". The "Cytb" data placed all studied specimens of "O. couesi" in a <a href="clade">clade</a> sister to the marsh rice rat; the mean <a href="genetic%20distance">genetic distance</a> between the two groups was 11.30%, much larger than the distance between sister species in the related genera "<a href="Melanomys">Melanomys</a>" and "<a href="Nectomys">Nectomys</a>" (7.48% and 7.52%, respectively). Within the "O. couesi" clade, two populations from Panama and Costa Rica were successively <a href="basal%20clade">basal</a> to the other specimens, which fell into two large subclades—one containing animals from the Pacific seaboard from western Mexico to El Salvador and the other containing rats from the eastern seaboard from Texas to Nicaragua. The Panamanian and Costa Rican populations differed by 6.53% to 11.93% from the others and the western and eastern subclades differed by 4.41% on average. Data from both of the slower-evolving nuclear markers "Rbp3" and "Adh1-I2" also placed examples of "Oryzomys" in two main clades, but did not recover the western and eastern groups of "O. couesi" as separate clades. In addition, "Adh1-I2" placed the Costa Rican population within the marsh rice rat clade and placed some western "O. couesi" specimens closer to the marsh rice rat than to the "O. couesi" group. The combined dataset supported the western and eastern clades within "O. couesi" and placed the Costa Rican population marginally closer to the marsh rice rat than to "O. couesi". Using the <a href="genetic%20species%20concept">genetic species concept</a>, the authors suggested that the four groups they found within "O. couesi" should be recognized as distinct species. If this suggestion is followed, the eastern subclade would retain the name "Oryzomys couesi", the western group would be named "Oryzomys mexicanus", and the appropriate names for the Panamanian and Costa Rican species remain unclear.

Populations of "Oryzomys couesi" from <a href="Jalisco">Jalisco</a>, western Mexico, east to El Salvador form a single "Cytb" clade, which Hanson and colleagues proposed to recognize as the species "Oryzomys mexicanus". These animals differ by 4.4% from "Oryzomys couesi" in the strict sense, which occurs to the north and east, are separated by mountain ranges from the latter, harbor different species of <a href="hantavirus">hantavirus</a>, and according to Merriam (1901) have more robust skulls, with larger <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a>, stronger <a href="zygomatic%20arch">zygomatic arch</a>es (cheekbones), and better developed ridges along the margins of the <a href="interorbital%20region">interorbital region</a> of the skull (between the eyes). Within the ""Oryzomys mexicanus"" clade, "Cytb" sequence differences average 2.06% and western (Jalisco to <a href="Oaxaca">Oaxaca</a>) and eastern (<a href="Chiapas">Chiapas</a> and El Salvador) groups form distinct subclades; Hanson and colleagues recognized these as different subspecies, "mexicanus" in the west and "zygomaticus" in the east.

As defined by Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales in 2009, the subspecies "Oryzomys couesi mexicanus" occurs along the Pacific coast from central Sonora to southeastern <a href="Oaxaca">Oaxaca</a> and inland along rivers into central <a href="Michoac%C3%A1n">Michoacán</a>, southern <a href="Morelos">Morelos</a>, southern <a href="Puebla">Puebla</a>, and northwestern Oaxaca. It usually lives below altitude, but has been found at in <a href="Jalisco">Jalisco</a>. This distributional pattern is similar to that of other western Mexican rodents such as "<a href="Sigmodon%20mascotensis">Sigmodon mascotensis</a>", "<a href="Hodomys%20alleni">Hodomys alleni</a>", "<a href="Peromyscus%20perfulvus">Peromyscus perfulvus</a>", and "<a href="Osgoodomys%20banderanus">Osgoodomys banderanus</a>" and has been recognized as a distinct <a href="biogeography">biogeographic</a> zone in some reviews. "O. c. mexicanus" occurs close to three other "Oryzomys" species—"O. albiventer", "O. peninsulae", and "O. nelsoni"—which are larger and different in some proportions and details of coloration.

<a href="Joel%20Asaph%20Allen">Joel Asaph Allen</a> first described "Oryzomys mexicanus" as a full species in 1897 from specimens from Jalisco. In the same publication, he also described "Oryzomys bulleri" from nearby <a href="Nayarit">Nayarit</a>, but he did not compare the two with each other. Merriam added a second species from Nayarit, "Oryzomys rufus", in 1901, noting that it was smaller and more reddish than "mexicanus". Goldman synonymized the three as "O. couesi mexicanus" in 1918 and in 2009 Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales concurred, arguing that the differences between "rufus" and "mexicanus" were age-related and within the normal range of variation of the animal. Another subspecies, "Oryzomys couesi lambi", was described by Burt in 1934 from central coastal Sonora, which extended the range of the species by at the time. This form is dark gray-brown, much darker than "mexicanus", and has a shorter tail and weaker <a href="jugal%20bone">jugals</a>. Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales wrote that it is similar to "mexicanus", but that further research is needed to determine whether it should be recognized as a subspecies. Large "O. couesi" from northern <a href="Sinaloa">Sinaloa</a> may also belong to this form. Goldman wrote that "mexicanus" was very similar to <a href="nominate%20subspecies">nominate</a> "couesi", but usually with paler fur; the upperparts are more buffy than in "couesi" and the underparts are usually white, but may be buffy, the normal color in "couesi".

"Oryzomys zygomaticus" was first described by Merriam in 1901 as a separate species similar to "mexicanus", but with the zygomatic arches broadly spreading and curved downward. Goldman, who reduced it to a subspecies of "couesi", recorded it from southwestern Guatemala and nearby Chiapas and described it as slightly paler than "O. c. couesi" but darker than "O. c. mexicanus". Three specimens from central El Salvador have "Cytb" sequences similar to those of "zygomaticus", but in "The Mammals of El Salvador" (1961), Burt and Stirton recorded only the subspecies "couesi" from the country, while noting that specimens from some localities were slightly paler than others.

Goldman grouped four subspecies of "couesi" from the interior plateaus of central Mexico together—"albiventer", "crinitus", "aztecus", and "regillus". Three of those ("albiventer" from Jalisco, "crinitus" from the <a href="Mexico%20City">Distrito Federal</a>, and "aztecus" from <a href="Morelos">Morelos</a>) were described by Merriam in 1901, and Goldman had himself described "regillus" from <a href="Michoac%C3%A1n">Michoacán</a> in 1915. According to Goldman, "aztecus" is pale and large-toothed, "crinitus" is large, dark and large-toothed, "regillus" is large and dark, and "albiventer" is large and relatively pale.

In their 2009 review of western Mexican "Oryzomys", Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales classified "<a href="Oryzomys%20albiventer">Oryzomys albiventer</a>" as a separate species from lowland "mexicanus" on the basis of clear <a href="morphometrics">morphometric</a> differentiation and offered some comments on the status of "crinitus", "regillus", and "aztecus", including the <a href="holotype">holotype</a>s of the three forms in their morphometric analyses. The holotypes of "regillus" and "aztecus" were at the upper end of the range of variation in their large series of "mexicanus" from the western lowlands, and "crinitus" clustered with specimens of "<a href="Oryzomys%20peninsulae">O. peninsulae</a>" from the tip of the <a href="Baja%20California%20Peninsula">Baja California Peninsula</a>. They suggested that "regillus" and "aztecus" may represent no more than robust upland populations of "mexicanus", but could not exclude the possibility that they represent a different species. That "crinitus", which occurs at over altitude in the <a href="Valley%20of%20Mexico">Valley of Mexico</a>, was the same species as "peninsulae" from the lowlands of the Baja California Peninsula they could not accept and they recommended further research to determine the relationships of "crinitus". A specimen from inland Michoacán has "Cytb" data characteristic of "mexicanus", but Hanson and colleagues did not have data for other interior Mexican "Oryzomys".

The <a href="holotype">holotype</a> of the species "Oryzomys fulgens", which Thomas had described in 1893, has no more precise locality than "Mexico", but the Valley of Mexico has been suggested as its origin. It is a large, coarse-furred, bright reddish, long-tailed species with a broad skull with widely spreading zygomatic arches. Goldman wrote that it was similar to "crinitus", but more intensely colored, and differed in the form of the interorbital region; he retained it as a separate species pending further investigations. Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales noted that archival research may yet uncover the precise origin of "O. fulgens", which could establish it as an older name for one of the other central Mexican "Oryzomys".

"Oryzomys" populations from Texas to Nicaragua form a single "Cytb" clade, within which the average sequence divergence is 1.28%, and Hanson and colleagues proposed that the name "Oryzomys couesi" be restricted to this clade. These populations correspond to two subspecies recognized by Goldman ("O. c. aquaticus" and "O. c. couesi") and an island form he retained as a species ("O. cozumelae"). Two other subspecies Goldman recognized, "O. c. richmondi" and "O. c. peragrus", and a third, "O. c. pinicola", that was described after Goldman's paper occur in the same region, but have not been studied genetically.

The northernmost populations of "Oryzomys couesi", those in southernmost Texas and nearby <a href="Tamaulipas">Tamaulipas</a>, Mexico, are classified as the subspecies "aquaticus", which was described as a separate species, "Oryzomys aquaticus", in 1891. Here the range of "O. couesi" meets that of the marsh rice rat; in parts of <a href="Kenedy%20County">Kenedy</a>, <a href="Willacy%20County">Willacy</a> and <a href="Cameron%20County%2C%20Texas">Cameron</a> counties, Texas, and in far northeastern Tamaulipas, the two are <a href="sympatric">sympatric</a> (occur in the same places). In the contact zone, "couesi" occurs further inland, while the marsh rice rat lives along the coast. In experimental conditions, the two fail to interbreed and genetic analysis yields no evidence of <a href="gene%20flow">gene flow</a> or <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridization</a> in the wild. Compared to populations further to the south, "aquaticus" is larger and paler and has a more robust skull. Specimens from Tamaulipas are slightly darker than those from Texas. The "Cytb" sequences of specimens of "aquaticus" form a separate group, but cluster among specimens of "O. c. couesi" from further south.

The form "peragrus" is known from further south in Mexico, in the <a href="R%C3%ADo%20Verde%20%28San%20Luis%20Potosi%29">Río Verde</a> basin of <a href="San%20Luis%20Potosi">San Luis Potosi</a>, the state of <a href="Hidalgo%20%28state%29">Hidalgo</a>, and far northern <a href="Veracruz">Veracruz</a>. Late <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> fossils of this form have been found in <a href="Cueva%20de%20Abre">Cueva de Abre</a>, Tamaulipas. According to Goldman, it is intermediate in color between "O. c. aquaticus" and "O. c. couesi", but has a skull similar to that of "aquaticus".

Goldman united populations ranging from northern Veracruz through eastern Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua south to far northwestern Costa Rica in the <a href="nominate%20subspecies">nominate subspecies</a>, "Oryzomys couesi couesi". He placed six other names as full synonyms of this form, which has its <a href="type%20locality%20%28biology%29">type locality</a> in Guatemala—"Oryzomys jalapae" Allen and Chapman, 1897, from Veracruz; "Oryzomys jalapae rufinus" Merriam, 1901, from Veracruz; "Oryzomys teapensis" Merriam, 1901, from <a href="Tabasco">Tabasco</a>; "Oryzomys goldmani" Merriam, 1901, from Veracruz; "Oryzomys jalapae apatelius" Eliot, 1904, from Veracruz; and "Oryzomys richardsoni" Allen, 1910, from Nicaragua. According to Goldman, individual variation within the subspecies is large, which has led to the large number of published synonyms, but populations from all parts of its range are essentially similar.

The subspecies "Oryzomys couesi pinicola" was described in 1932 from a pine ridge in western British Honduras (now <a href="Belize">Belize</a>); it is smaller and darker than nominate "couesi", which also occurs in Belize, and has a more delicate skull. In 1901, Merriam described the "Oryzomys" of the island of <a href="Cozumel">Cozumel</a> as a separate species, "Oryzomys cozumelae", and Goldman kept it as such because of its large size, dark fur, and long tail. In 1965, however, Knox Jones and Timothy Lawlor judged the differences between "cozumelae" and mainland "couesi" trivial and found that "cozumelae" was inside the range of variation of mainland "Oryzomys" populations; accordingly, they demoted the island form to a subspecies. Mark Engstrom and colleagues, writing in 1989, reaffirmed this conclusion. For an island form, this population is highly genetically variable. In its "Cytb" sequence data, it falls among populations of nominate "couesi". "Oryzomys couesi" is also found on <a href="Turneffe%20Atoll">Turneffe Atoll</a> off the coast of Belize and <a href="Roat%C3%A1n">Roatán</a> off Honduras.

The "Oryzomys" of the eastern lowlands of Nicaragua was described as a separate species, "Oryzomys richmondi", by Merriam in 1901, and Goldman retained it as a subspecies of "O. couesi" on the basis of its distinctly dark fur. In reviewing Nicaraguan "Oryzomys" in 1986, Jones and Engstrom did not keep "richmondi" as separate, because they thought the difference in color too small for the recognition of subspecies. "<a href="Oryzomys%20dimidiatus">Oryzomys dimidiatus</a>", a small, dark "Oryzomys" with gray underparts, occurs with "O. couesi" in southeastern Nicaragua. According to Jones and Engstrom, rice rats from the island of <a href="Ometepe">Ometepe</a> in <a href="Lake%20Nicaragua">Lake Nicaragua</a> are distinctive in their large skull and small external measurements, with an especially short tail, soft fur that is orange-brown above and buffish below, and lack of <a href="sphenopalatine%20vacuities">sphenopalatine vacuities</a> (openings in the roof of the <a href="mesopterygoid%20fossa">mesopterygoid fossa</a>, the gap behind the end of the bony <a href="palate">palate</a>). They considered that this population probably represented a separate subspecies, but declined to propose a new name because they had only one adult specimen. In Nicaragua, "O. couesi" occurs up to an altitude of .

"Oryzomys" from Costa Rica have historically been referred to "O. c. couesi", but Hanson and colleagues found that two specimens from Refugio Nacional de Vida Silvestre Mixto Maquenque, northeastern Costa Rica, differed as much from other "O. couesi" (11.93% "Cytb" sequence divergence) as "O. couesi" differed from the marsh rice rat (11.30%). They suggested that these animals represented a species distinct from "O. couesi", but were unable to resolve the correct name for the species because they could not examine samples of "dimidiatus" or "richmondi".

"Oryzomys" is rare in Panama. Panamanian "Oryzomys" were first described by Goldman in 1912, who introduced the name "Oryzomys gatunensis" for a specimen from <a href="Gat%C3%BAn">Gatún</a> in the <a href="Panama%20Canal%20Zone">Canal Zone</a>. In 1918, Goldman kept the animal as a separate species, remarking that it was similar to "richmondi", but distinctive in the well-developed ridges along the margins of the interorbital region, the short <a href="interparietal%20bone">interparietal bone</a> (part of the roof of the <a href="braincase">braincase</a>), and the long <a href="nasal%20bone">nasal bone</a>s. In 1937, Bole described another species of Panamanian "Oryzomys", "Oryzomys azuerensis" from Paracoté, <a href="Veraguas%20Province">Veraguas Province</a>. It is a brown form, lacking the reddish tones of nearby populations, and has a broad skull with a short rostrum (front part) and ridges on the interorbital region like those of "gatunensis". Although Goldman recommended to him that "gatunensis" and "azuerensis" both be treated as subspecies of "couesi", Bole described "azuerensis" as a species because it did not seem intermediate between the geographically closest forms, "gatunensis" and "couesi", and was separated by a large gap from the nearest known populations of "O. couesi" in northwestern Costa Rica and southeastern Nicaragua. In a 1966 review of Panamanian mammals, Charles Handley reduced both "gatunensis" and "azuerensis" to subspecies of the marsh rice rat (in which "O. couesi" was included at the time), and when "O. couesi" was reinstated as a separate species these forms went with it. Specimens from near the type locality of "azuerensis" differ by about 7% in their "Cytb" sequences from other "O. couesi", which suggests that they may represent a separate species. However, Hanson and colleagues did not reinstate "azuerensis" as a species, because they could not examine samples of "gatunensis".

"Oryzomys couesi" was first reported from Colombia in 1987, when <a href="Philip%20Hershkovitz">Philip Hershkovitz</a> reported on its occurrence at <a href="Monter%C3%ADa">Montería</a> in <a href="C%C3%B3rdoba%20Department">Córdoba Department</a>, northwestern Colombia. The Colombian specimen is <a href="ochraceous">ochraceous</a> in color throughout and according to Hershkovitz almost identical to specimens from Guatemala, but distinctive in that the upper lip is white. He suggested that "O. couesi" may also be discovered in the Pacific lowlands of the <a href="El%20Choc%C3%B3">Chocó</a> in western Colombia.

Several <a href="common%20name">common name</a>s have been proposed for "Oryzomys couesi" and the synonyms currently associated with it. Eliot in 1905 and Goldman in 1918 gave separate common names for each of the species and subspecies they recognized. Many authors have used "Coues' Rice Rat" or some variation thereof for "O. couesi", but "Coues' Oryzomys" has also been used.

"Oryzomys couesi" is a medium-sized to large rat with coarse fur that is buff to reddish above, becoming paler towards the sides and cheeks and darker on the rump and face. The underparts are white to buff. The fur is shorter, brighter, and more intense in color than in the marsh rice rat. The snout ends bluntly and the moderately large eyes show reddish <a href="eyeshine">eyeshine</a>. The small ears are black on the outside and the inside is covered with short, gray to buff or red hairs. The long tail is dark brown above and white to light brown below. The feet are long and stout. On the forefeet, the <a href="ungual%20tuft">ungual tuft</a>s (tufts of hair on the digits) are present. Many of the <a href="Paw%23Common%20characteristics">pads</a> on the hindfeet are reduced, as are the ungual tufts, and small <a href="interdigital%20webbing">interdigital webs</a> may be present in at least some specimens. Some of these traits are common adaptations to life in the water in oryzomyines. As in most other oryzomyines, females have eight <a href="mammae">mammae</a>. Head and body length is , tail length is , hindfoot length is , ear length is , and body mass is . Studies in Texas and El Salvador found that males are slightly larger than females.

The <a href="stomach">stomach</a> has the characteristic pattern of sigmodontines (<a href="Locule">unilocular</a>-hemiglandular): it is not split in two chambers by an <a href="incisura%20angularis">incisura angularis</a> and the front part (<a href="antrum">antrum</a>) is covered by a <a href="glandular%20epithelium">glandular epithelium</a>. The <a href="gall%20bladder">gall bladder</a> is absent, a <a href="synapomorphy">synapomorphy</a> (shared-derived character) of Oryzomyini. The <a href="karyotype">karyotype</a> includes 56 <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s and a <a href="karyotype%23Fundamental%20number">fundamental number</a> of 56 <a href="autosome">autosomal</a> arms (2n = 56, FNa = 56). The autosomes include 26 pairs of <a href="acrocentric">acrocentric</a> chromosomes, with a long and a very short arm, and one medium-sized <a href="submetacentric">submetacentric</a> pair, with one arm shorter than the other. The <a href="X%20chromosome">X chromosome</a> is either <a href="acrocentric">acrocentric</a>, with a long and a short arm, or <a href="Centromere%23Subtelocentric">subtelocentric</a>, with a long and a vestigial arm. The form of the <a href="sex%20chromosome">sex chromosome</a>s has been used to distinguish the marsh rice rat from "Oryzomys couesi", but there are no consistent differences between the two.

As is characteristic of Sigmodontinae, "Oryzomys couesi" has a complex penis, with the <a href="baculum">baculum</a> (penis bone) ending in three <a href="cartilage">cartilaginous</a> digits at its tip. The outer surface of the penis is mostly <a href="penile%20spines">covered by small spines</a>, but there is a broad band of nonspinous tissue. The papilla (nipple-like projection) on the dorsal (upper) side of the penis is covered with small spines, a character "Oryzomys couesi" shares only with "<a href="Oligoryzomys">Oligoryzomys</a>" and the marsh rice rat among oryzomyines examined. On the <a href="urethral%20process">urethral process</a>, located in the crater at the end of the penis, a fleshy <a href="process%20%28anatomy%29">process</a> (the <a href="subapical%20lobule">subapical lobule</a>) is present; it is absent in all other oryzomyines with studied penes except the marsh rice rat and "<a href="Holochilus%20brasiliensis">Holochilus brasiliensis</a>".

The nasal and <a href="premaxillary">premaxillary</a> bones do not extend back beyond the point where the <a href="lacrimal%20bone">lacrimal</a>, <a href="frontal%20bone">frontal</a>, and <a href="maxillary%20bone">maxillary bone</a>s meet. The <a href="zygomatic%20plate">zygomatic plate</a>, the flattened front part of the zygomatic arch, is broad and develops a notch at its front end. The plate's back margin is located before the first upper molar. The jugal bone, part of the zygomatic arch, is reduced, as usual in oryzomyines. The <a href="sphenopalatine%20foramen">sphenopalatine foramen</a>, a <a href="foramen">foramen</a> (opening) at the side of the skull above the molars, is small; it is much larger in the marsh rice rat. The narrowest part of the interorbital region is towards the front and the edges are lined by prominent shelves. The <a href="parietal%20bone">parietal bone</a>s extend to the sides of the braincase. The interparietal bone is narrow and wedge-shaped, so that the parietal and <a href="squamosal%20bone">squamosal bone</a>s meet extensively.

The <a href="incisive%20foramen">incisive foramina</a>, openings in the front part of the palate, reach backward between the molars. The palate is long, extending substantially beyond the third molars, the usual condition in oryzomyines. The back part, near the third molars, is usually perforated by prominent <a href="posterolateral%20palatal%20pits">posterolateral palatal pits</a>, which are recessed into fossae (depressions). Sphenopalatine vacuities are usually absent, but have been reported in some populations. There is no <a href="alisphenoid%20strut">alisphenoid strut</a>, an extension of the <a href="alisphenoid%20bone">alisphenoid bone</a> that in some oryzomyines separates two foramina in the skull. The condition of the <a href="artery">arteries</a> in the head is highly <a href="Synapomorphy">derived</a>. The <a href="subsquamosal%20fenestra">subsquamosal fenestra</a>, an opening in the back part of the skull determined by the shape of the <a href="squamosal%20bone">squamosal bone</a>, is present. The squamosal lacks a suspensory process that contacts the <a href="tegmen%20tympani">tegmen tympani</a>, the roof of the <a href="tympanic%20cavity">tympanic cavity</a>, a defining character of oryzomyines. There are some openings in the <a href="mastoid%20bone">mastoid bone</a>.

In the <a href="mandible">mandible</a> (lower jaw), the <a href="mental%20foramen">mental foramen</a>, an opening just before the first molar, opens sidewards, not upwards as in a few other oryzomyines. The upper and lower <a href="masseteric%20ridge">masseteric ridge</a>s, which anchor some of the chewing muscles, join at a point below the first molar and do not extend forward beyond that point. The <a href="capsular%20process">capsular process</a>, a raising of the bone of the back of the mandible that houses the back end of the <a href="incisor">incisor</a>, is large.

The <a href="dental%20formula">dental formula</a> is (one upper and one lower incisor and three upper and three lower <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a> on each side of the jaws), as <a href="muroid%20molar">usual in muroid rodents</a>. The upper incisors are <a href="opisthodont">opisthodont</a>, with the chewing edge located behind the vertical plane of the teeth. The molars are <a href="bunodont">bunodont</a>, with the cusps higher than the connecting crests, and <a href="brachydont">brachydont</a>, low-crowned, as in most other oryzomyines. Many accessory crests, including the <a href="mesoloph">mesoloph</a> on the upper molars and the <a href="mesolophid">mesolophid</a> on the lower molars, are present, another trait "O. couesi" shares with most but not all other oryzomyines. The flexi and flexids (valleys between the cusps and crests) at the labial (outer) side of the molars are closed by <a href="cingulum%20%28tooth%29">cingula</a> (ridges).

On the first and second upper molars, the flexi do not extend to the midline of the molars. The <a href="anterocone">anterocone</a>, the front cusp of the upper first molar, is not divided in two by an indentation at its front (<a href="anteromedian%20flexus">anteromedian flexus</a>). A crest, the <a href="anteroloph">anteroloph</a>, is present behind the labial cuspule. As in most oryzomyines, the upper molars all have one root on the inner (lingual) side and two on the outer (labial) side; in addition, the first upper molar usually has another small labial root.

On the first lower molar, the labial and lingual conules of the <a href="anteroconid">anteroconid</a>, the frontmost cusp, are separated by an <a href="anteromedian%20fossette">anteromedian fossette</a>. The second lower molar bears a crest, the <a href="anterolophid">anterolophid</a>, before the two cusps, the <a href="protoconid">protoconid</a> and <a href="metaconid">metaconid</a>, that form the front edge of the molar in some other oryzomyines. There is a distinct ridge (<a href="anterolabial%20cingulum">anterolabial cingulum</a>) at the outer front (anterolabial) edge of the molar, before the protoconid. The third lower molar also bears an anterolophid and an anterolabial cingulum. The first lower molar has large roots at the front and back of the tooth and two smaller ones in between, at the labial and lingual side. The second and third lowers molars have two large roots, one at the front and one at the back.

As usual in oryzomyines, there are twelve ribs. The first rib <a href="articulation%20%28anatomy%29">articulates</a> with both the last <a href="cervical%20vertebra">cervical</a> (neck) and first <a href="thoracic%20vertebra">thoracic</a> (chest) vertebrae, a synapomorphy of the Sigmodontinae. <a href="Anapophyses">Anapophyses</a>, processes at the back of a vertebra, are absent from the fifth <a href="lumbar%20vertebra">lumbar</a>. Between the second and third <a href="caudal%20vertebra">caudal vertebra</a>e, <a href="hemal%20arch">hemal arch</a>es (small bones) are present with a spinous back border. The <a href="entepicondylar%20foramen">entepicondylar foramen</a> is absent, as in all members of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as in some other rodents, this foramen perforates the distal (far) end of the <a href="humerus">humerus</a> (upper arm bone).

The distribution of "Oryzomys couesi" extends from southern Texas and central <a href="Sonora">Sonora</a>, but not the central plateau of Mexico, through Central America south and east to northwestern Colombia; see under "<a href="%23Taxonomy">Taxonomy</a>" for details. The species has also been found in late <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> cave deposits in Mexico and Honduras. It is common in watery habitats, such as marshes and small streams, but also occurs in forests and <a href="shrubland">shrubland</a>s with sufficient cover. In addition, it is found in sugarcane and rice fields. In Texas, it occurs in marsh vegetation along "<a href="Resaca%20%28channel%29">resacas</a>" (<a href="oxbow%20lake">oxbow lake</a>s) and in Veracruz, it has even been found on the dry <a href="coastal%20plain">coastal plain</a> among shrubs. It occurs from altitude down to sea level. On Cozumel, the proportion of juveniles and females is higher near roads that function as habitat edges. Cozumel rice rats rarely cross roads, which may isolate subpopulations on the island.

"Oryzomys couesi" lives on the ground and is <a href="List%20of%20semiaquatic%20tetrapods">semiaquatic</a>, spending much time in the water, as Alston in his original description already recognized, but is also a good climber. A study in Costa Rica found that "O. couesi" is an excellent swimmer, diving well and using its tail to propel itself. It is probably able to forage underwater, which may help <a href="niche%20differentiation">differentiate its niche</a> from that of the ecologically similar cotton rat "<a href="Sigmodon%20hirsutus">Sigmodon hirsutus</a>", which also swims well, but does not dive. When disturbed, "O. couesi" will enter the water and swim away. It is primarily <a href="nocturnal">active during the night</a>. "Oryzomys couesi" builds globular nests of woven vegetation suspended among reeds, about above the water or the ground; in Texas, larger individuals make larger nests. It does not usually make its own runways in vegetation, but may use those of other rodents, such as cotton rats.

<a href="Population%20density">Population densities</a> range from 5 to 30 per ha (2 to 12 per acre). On Cozumel, density is around 14.5 to 16.5 per ha (5.9 to 6.7 per acre), but shows large seasonal variation. In western Mexico, one study found densities of 3 per ha (1.2 per acre) in <a href="cloud%20forest">cloud forest</a> and 1 per ha (0.4 per acre) in a disturbed area. In 24 hours, male Texas "O. couesi" move up to and females up to . The diet includes both plant material, including seeds and green parts, and animals, including small fish, crustaceans, snails, insects like ants and beetles, and other invertebrates. It probably breeds around the year and after a pregnancy of 21 to 28 days, the female produces litters of two to seven young, with an average of 3.8, according to Reid's "Mammals of Central America & Southeast Mexico". In 28 pregnant females from Nicaragua, litter size varied from one to eight, averaging 4.4. The young become reproductively active when seven weeks old and the <a href="biological%20life%20cycle">life cycle</a> is short.

The <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> snake "<a href="Boa%20constrictor">Boa constrictor</a>" preys on "O. couesi" on Cozumel. <a href="Parasite">Parasite</a>s recorded on "O. couesi" in Veracruz include unidentified ticks, mites, fleas, and fly larvae. The flea "<a href="Polygenis%20odiosus">Polygenis odiosus</a>" was found on an "Oryzomys couesi" from Cozumel. Out of ten "O. couesi" in San Luis Potosí, five each were infected by the <a href="nematode">nematode</a> worms "<a href="Hassalstrongylus%20musculi">Hassalstrongylus musculi</a>" and "<a href="Hassalstrongylus%20bocqueti">H. bocqueti</a>", with about 25 worms per rat, and two were infected by one or two <a href="cestode">cestode</a>s of the genus "<a href="Raillietina">Raillietina</a>". The <a href="mite">mite</a>s "<a href="Eubrachylaelaps%20circularis">Eubrachylaelaps circularis</a>" and "<a href="Gigantolaelaps%20boneti">Gigantolaelaps boneti</a>" have been found on "Oryzomys couesi" in Oaxaca, the <a href="sucking%20louse">sucking louse</a> "<a href="Hoplopleura%20oryzomydis">Hoplopleura oryzomydis</a>" in Nicaragua, the mites "<a href="Laelaps%20oryzomydis">Laelaps oryzomydis</a>", "<a href="Echinonyssus%20microchelae">Echinonyssus microchelae</a>", "<a href="Ornithonyssus%20bacoti">Ornithonyssus bacoti</a>", "<a href="Prolistrophorus%20frontalis">Prolistrophorus frontalis</a>", and "<a href="Prolistrophorus%20bakeri">Prolistrophorus bakeri</a>" in Colima, and the <a href="apicomplexa">apicomplexa</a>n "<a href="Eimeria%20couesii">Eimeria couesii</a>" in Mexico. The species is infected by two <a href="hantavirus">hantavirus</a>es—<a href="Catacamas%20virus">Catacamas virus</a> in Honduras and <a href="Playa%20de%20Oro%20virus">Playa de Oro virus</a> in western Mexico—which are related to the <a href="Bayou%20virus">Bayou virus</a> infecting the marsh rice rat, a common cause of hantavirus infections in the United States. No hantavirus infections in humans have been linked to "O. couesi" hantaviruses, however. Chiapas "O. couesi" easily survive experimental infection with several <a href="arbovirus">arbovirus</a>es, including the <a href="Venezuelan%20equine%20encephalitis%20virus">Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus</a>, suggesting that the species may serve as a <a href="natural%20reservoir">reservoir</a> for that virus.

The <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a> lists "Oryzomys couesi" as "<a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a>", because it is a widely distributed, common species with broad habitat tolerance that occurs in many <a href="protected%20area">protected area</a>s. <a href="Habitat%20destruction">Habitat destruction</a>, such as drainage of wetlands, may threaten some populations. In many areas, it is so common that it is considered a plague species. Populations even persist in the Valley of Mexico, as evidenced by a photograph published in 2006. However, it is listed as threatened in Texas, where its distribution is very limited, because of habitat loss. In 1979, Benson and Gehlbach estimated the size of the Texas population to be about 15,000. A 2001 study predicted that <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a> would drive the Texas population to extinction, because no suitable habitats would continue to exist. The Cozumel population has declined substantially since the mid-1980s, perhaps due to habitat disturbance and predation by introduced species.

Bourdon died at the age of 21 near his hometown of <a href="Shippagan%2C%20New%20Brunswick">Shippagan</a>, <a href="New%20Brunswick">New Brunswick</a>, when his motorcycle collided with a tractor trailer.

Born on February 16, 1987, Bourdon was an only child raised by his mother, Suzanne Boucher, in the small French-speaking community of <a href="Shippagan%2C%20New%20Brunswick">Shippagan</a>, <a href="New%20Brunswick">New Brunswick</a>. When he was nine, he was diagnosed with <a href="juvenile%20arthritis">juvenile arthritis</a> and needed to use a wheelchair, which he later overcame. As a teenager, he attended <a href="L%E2%80%99%C3%A9cole%20Marie-Esther">Marie-Esther</a> Secondary, where he was a straight-A student. Growing up in a fishing town, he worked summers on his uncle's crab fishing boat.

As a youth, Bourdon played in the 1999, 2000 and 2001 <a href="Quebec%20International%20Pee-Wee%20Hockey%20Tournament">Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament</a>s with the Peninsule Acadien Lynx <a href="minor%20ice%20hockey">minor ice hockey</a> team. He later played with the Miramichi Rivermen minor teams from ages 15–16. After being the third overall choice in the 2003 QMJHL draft, Bourdon left home when he was 16, returning in the off-season to live with his mother. Upon turning professional and signing his first contract, he anonymously donated <a href="Canadian%20dollar">C$</a>10,000 to the local minor hockey association for families who could not afford equipment. His donation was posthumously revealed by his former bantam hockey coach, Gilles Cormier, who managed the local arena at the time of Bourdon's death.

Bourdon joined the <a href="Val-d%27Or%20Foreurs">Val-d'Or Foreurs</a> for the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20QMJHL%20season">2003–04 season</a>, registering eight points in 64 regular season games and scoring one goal in seven playoff games. He appeared in all 70 games with the Foreurs in <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20QMJHL%20season">2004–05</a>, scoring 13 goals and 19 assists, and participated in the <a href="CHL%20Top%20Prospects%20Game">CHL Top Prospects Game</a>, an exhibition for draft-eligible players. In June 2005, Bourdon was the tenth pick overall, selected by the Vancouver Canucks, at the <a href="2005%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">2005 NHL Entry Draft</a>. Ranked sixth overall for North American skaters coming into the draft, Bourdon was noted as a physical two-way defenceman with significant offensive skills and a strong shot, as well as an excellent skater. He was the second Shippagan-born hockey player to be drafted in the NHL, after goaltender Yanick Degrace was drafted by the <a href="Philadelphia%20Flyers">Philadelphia Flyers</a> in <a href="1991%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">1991</a>.
Invited to the Canucks training camp, Bourdon almost made the team as an 18-year-old, but instead was returned to the QMJHL for further development. He began the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20QMJHL%20season">2005–06 season</a> with the Foreurs, registering 20 points in 20 games, before being traded to the <a href="Moncton%20Wildcats">Moncton Wildcats</a>, who were hosting the <a href="2006%20Memorial%20Cup">2006 Memorial Cup</a>. In exchange for Bourdon, the Wildcats sent Ian Mathieu-Girard, Jean-Sébastien Adam, a fourth-round pick, and a first-round selection in 2008 to Val-d'Or. Shortly after the trade, Bourdon injured his ankle, suffering a fractured <a href="fibula">fibula</a>, high and low sprains, and a second-degree <a href="ligament">ligament</a> tear. Although he returned to join Moncton in the playoffs, doctors told him that it would take two years to fully recover. He managed a full recovery after one year, but his turning ability and backwards skating sometimes lagged. Competing in the Memorial Cup, he reached the <a href="Canadian%20Hockey%20League">Canadian Hockey League</a> (CHL) final with the Wildcats, who lost 6–2 to the <a href="Quebec%20Remparts">Quebec Remparts</a>.

After signing a three-year contract, worth $850,000 per year with the Canucks on May 4, 2006, Bourdon earned a spot on the team's <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20NHL%20season">2006–07</a> opening roster. He played his first NHL game on October 10, 2006 against the <a href="Minnesota%20Wild">Minnesota Wild</a>, but after playing nine games and scoring no points, he was sent again to the QMJHL for further development. On January 8, 2007, Bourdon was again traded in the QMJHL, with Moncton sending him to the <a href="Cape%20Breton%20Screaming%20Eagles">Cape Breton Screaming Eagles</a> in exchange for <a href="Mark%20Barberio%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Mark Barberio</a> and a first round selection in the 2007 QMJHL draft. As a Screaming Eagle, Bourdon lost in the QMJHL semi-final against his former team, Val-d'Or. He finished the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20QMJHL%20season">2006–07 QMJHL season</a> with 20 points in 36 games. When the Canucks did not qualify for the playoffs, they sent Bourdon to play five games for the <a href="Manitoba%20Moose">Manitoba Moose</a>, who were in the middle of the AHL playoffs. He was held pointless through five AHL playoff games. Including his participation in the <a href="2007%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">2007 World Junior Championships</a>, Bourdon played for five different teams throughout the 2006–07 season.

Initially failing to make the Canucks starting roster out of training camp, Bourdon began the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20NHL%20season">2007–08 season</a> with the Manitoba Moose; however, because of a series of injuries among the Canucks' defencemen throughout the season, Bourdon was called up on several occasions. Bourdon scored his first goal on November 16, 2007, against goaltender <a href="Niklas%20B%C3%A4ckstr%C3%B6m">Niklas Bäckström</a> in a 6–2 win over the Minnesota Wild. Bourdon finished the season on the Canucks roster, and was sent back to the Manitoba Moose for the AHL playoffs, playing in six playoff games for the Moose. He appeared in 27 games for the Canucks over the season, scoring one more goal, as well as scoring 14 points during 41 games with the Moose.

As a young and promising defenceman, Bourdon was regularly mentioned in rumours of trades for more offence at the forward positions. Most significantly, he was speculated to be part of a package in exchange for <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Lightning">Tampa Bay Lightning</a> forward <a href="Brad%20Richards">Brad Richards</a>. Although Bourdon had a powerful shot, he did not play defence responsibly enough to earn a regular spot on the roster. He began to show signs of improvement and maturity as the Canucks used him more in the 2007–08 season.

Bourdon made his international debut representing <a href="Canada%20men%27s%20national%20junior%20ice%20hockey%20team">Team Canada</a> in the <a href="2005%20IIHF%20World%20U18%20Championships">2005 World Under-18 Championships</a>, held in the <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a>, earning one assist in a silver-medal effort.

In the <a href="2006%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">2006 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships</a> in <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, Bourdon competed in his first of two consecutive <a href="World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">World Junior Championships</a>. He was named player of the game in round-robin play after a scoring a goal and an assist in a 4–0 win against Norway. He finished the tournament leading all defencemen in scoring with six points in six games and was named to the tournament's all-star team. Upon winning gold, Bourdon returned to Shippagan and showcased his medal at the local arena to crowds of supporters.

At the <a href="2007%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">2007 World Junior Championships</a> in <a href="Leksand">Leksand</a> and <a href="Mora%2C%20Sweden">Mora</a>, <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>, Bourdon was awarded a second player of the game distinction after the first round-robin contest against Sweden, in which he scored the <a href="game-winning%20goal">game-winning goal</a> in a 2–0 victory. Later in the tournament, Bourdon scored the game-tying goal in the third period of a 2–1 shootout win over the United States in the semi-final. In total, Bourdon picked up two goals and two assists in six games, helping Canada to a second straight gold medal.

Bourdon was killed instantly in a motorcycle collision in <a href="Lam%C3%A8que%2C%20New%20Brunswick">Lamèque</a>, <a href="New%20Brunswick">New Brunswick</a>, near his hometown of Shippagan on May 29, 2008, when he hit a tractor-trailer after losing control of his 2009 <a href="Suzuki%20GSX-R1000">Suzuki GSX-R1000</a> and crossing the centre line. <a href="Environment%20Canada">Environment Canada</a> showed winds gusting to more than 50 km/h (31 mph) in the area at the time of the accident. The <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Mounted%20Police">RCMP</a> stated that Bourdon's inexperience with motorcycles may have been a factor in the crash.

Bourdon's agent, Kent Hughes, stated that he never knew about his client's new hobby (motorcycles). "I had no idea," he explained to <a href="CKNW">CKNW</a> in Vancouver. "Another client of ours, <a href="Kris%20Letang">Kris Letang</a>, said Luc let him know he was riding his dad's motorcycle with some friends a week or two ago. I have since been told—though I don't know—that he actually bought a motorcycle two days ago". Maryse Bourdon, Luc's stepmother, said he had purchased the motorcycle about three weeks before. Letang, Bourdon's close friend and former roommate from junior hockey, planned to buy a motorcycle after Bourdon told him about his; because of the crash, he decided against it.

The American Hockey League, where Bourdon had played for the Manitoba Moose, observed a moment of silence in Bourdon's honour prior to game one of the Calder Cup Finals between the <a href="Chicago%20Wolves">Chicago Wolves</a> and the <a href="Wilkes-Barre/Scranton%20Penguins">Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins</a> just hours after the accident, and on May 31, the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Penguins">Pittsburgh Penguins</a> and <a href="Detroit%20Red%20Wings">Detroit Red Wings</a> observed a moment of silence before game four of the <a href="2008%20Stanley%20Cup%20Final">2008 Stanley Cup Final</a>. During the <a href="2008%20NHL%20Draft">2008 NHL Draft</a>, the Canucks' management wore guitar pins to remember Bourdon, because he was an avid guitarist.

At the Canucks' <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20NHL%20season">2008–09 NHL season</a> home opener against the <a href="Calgary%20Flames">Calgary Flames</a>, the Canucks honoured Bourdon with a brief pre-game ceremony. Bourdon's family was presented with his last game-worn jersey, given by the fan who won the jersey during an annual charity event the previous season. Afterwards, <a href="Red%20Rider">Tom Cochrane and Red Rider</a> performed "Big League" during the video tribute. Commemorative pins were handed out to fans attending the game and were worn throughout the season by <a href="General%20Motors%20Place">General Motors Place</a> hosts. The Canucks also wore "LB" on their helmets that season in memory of Bourdon. At General Motors Place, the Luc Bourdon Wall of Dreams was established to commemorate Bourdon.

The Manitoba Moose honoured Bourdon with a video tribute before their 2008–09 home opener on October 10, 2008. Moose players all wore #4 Bourdon jerseys during the warmup, and "#4 LB" patches were worn on the jerseys of players all season. A senior men's ice hockey team in New Brunswick, the Lameque/Shippagan Pêcheurs, also honoured him, wearing a "28 Bourdon" patch on their jerseys over the course of the 2008–09 season. During the <a href="2009%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">2009 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships</a>, Team Canada honoured Bourdon by wearing LB stickers in their opening game. In addition, no Canadian player wore the jersey number 6, the number Bourdon wore with the national team, throughout the tournament.

In the 2008–09 season, the QMJHL Moncton Wildcats hockey club, where Bourdon had played during the 2006 season, paid tribute by having Acadian singer Roland Gauvin, from the musical group "<a href="1755%20%28band%29">1755</a>", play "Le monde a bien change" along with a video tribute. The franchise presented the Bourdon family with Bourdon's Moncton Wildcats Jersey as well as flowers. The team wore an LB patch on their uniforms for that season.

Sonic the Hedgehog (2006 video game)

Development began in 2004, led by "Sonic" co-creator <a href="Yuji%20Naka">Yuji Naka</a>. Sonic Team sought to create an appealing game in the vein of <a href="superhero%20film">superhero film</a>s like "<a href="Batman%20Begins">Batman Begins</a>", hoping it would advance the series with a realistic tone and multiple gameplay styles. Problems developed after Naka resigned to form his own company, <a href="Prope">Prope</a>. The team split to work on the <a href="Wii">Wii</a> game "<a href="Sonic%20and%20the%20Secret%20Rings">Sonic and the Secret Rings</a>" (2007), resulting in "Sonic the Hedgehog" being rushed for the <a href="holiday%20season">holiday season</a>. It was released for <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> in November 2006 and for <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> the following month. Versions for Wii and <a href="Windows">Windows</a> were canceled. <a href="Downloadable%20content">Downloadable content</a> featuring new <a href="single-player">single-player</a> modes was released in 2007.

"Sonic the Hedgehog" received praise in prerelease showings, as journalists believed it could return to the series' roots after years of mixed reviews. However, it was <a href="List%20of%20video%20games%20notable%20for%20negative%20reception">a critical failure</a>. Reviewers criticized its loading times, camera system, story, stability, and controls. It has been frequently described as one of the worst games in the series. In 2010, Sega delisted "Sonic the Hedgehog" from retailers, following its decision to remove all "Sonic" games with below-average <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> scores to increase the value of the brand. Its failure led to a rethinking of the series' direction; future games ignored its tone and most characters.

"Sonic the Hedgehog" is a <a href="3D%20platformer">3D platformer</a> with <a href="action-adventure%20game">action-adventure</a> and <a href="Role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing</a> elements. Like "<a href="Sonic%20Adventure">Sonic Adventure</a>", the <a href="single-player">single-player</a> navigates through open-ended <a href="hub%20level%20system">hub worlds</a> where they can converse with townspeople and perform missions to advance the story. The main gameplay takes place in linear <a href="Level%20%28video%20gaming%29">levels</a> that become accessible as the game progresses. The main playable characters are three <a href="hedgehogs">hedgehogs</a>: <a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28character%29">Sonic</a>, <a href="Shadow%20the%20Hedgehog">Shadow</a>, and <a href="Silver%20the%20Hedgehog">Silver</a>, who feature in separate campaigns titled "stories". A bonus "Last Story", which involves all three hedgehogs and concludes the storyline, is unlocked upon completing the first three.

Sonic's story focuses on the speed-based platforming seen in <a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%23Common%20features">previous "Sonic" games</a>, with some sections having him run at full speed while dodging obstacles or riding a <a href="snowboard">snowboard</a>. Another character, Princess Elise, must be escorted in some stages, and she can use a special barrier to guard Sonic. Shadow's sections are similarly speedy, albeit more combat-oriented, with some segments having him ride vehicles. In contrast, Silver's levels are slower and revolve around his use of <a href="telekinesis">telekinesis</a> to defeat enemies and solve puzzles. In certain areas, control is switched to one of several friend characters, with their own abilities.

Although each character traverses the same levels, their unique abilities allow the player to access different areas of each stage and prevent them from accessing certain items. Scattered through each level are <a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%23Common%20features">golden rings</a>, which serve as a form of health. The rings can protect a character from a single hit by an enemy or obstacle, at which point they will be scattered and blink before disappearing. The game begins with Sonic, Shadow, and Silver each assigned a limited number of <a href="Health%20%28gaming%29%23Icon-based%20health">lives</a>. These lives are successively lost whenever, with no rings in their possession, the characters are hit by an enemy or obstacle or encounter other fatal hazard. The game ends when the player exhausts the characters' lives. Every few levels, players will encounter a <a href="boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">boss</a> stage; to proceed, they must defeat the boss by depleting its <a href="Health%20%28gaming%29">health meter</a>.

Upon completion of a level or mission, players are given a grade depending on their performance, with an "S" rank being the best and a "D" rank being the worst. Players are given money for completing missions; more money is given to higher ranks. This money can be used to buy upgrades for the player character. Certain upgrades are required to complete the game. The game also features two <a href="multiplayer">multiplayer</a> modes: "Tag", a cooperative mode where two players must work together to clear levels and collect <a href="Chaos%20Emerald">Chaos Emerald</a>s, and "Battle", a <a href="player%20versus%20player">player versus player</a> mode where two players race against each other.

In the land of Soleanna, Sonic and his sidekick Tails protect Princess Elise from her kidnapper <a href="Doctor%20Eggman">Doctor Eggman</a>. Meanwhile, Shadow and his fellow agent Rouge accidentally release an evil spirit, Mephiles. The spirit transports them to a <a href="post-apocalyptic">post-apocalyptic</a> future ravaged by a demonic monster, Iblis. When Mephiles meets survivors Silver and Blaze, he fools them into thinking Sonic is the cause of this destruction and sends them to the present to kill him.

Though at first Silver stalks Sonic and impedes his attempts to save Elise, Shadow reveals to him that Sonic is not the cause of his world's suffering but rather Mephiles, who is trying to erase the past for his own evil purposes. Throughout the story, Sonic and friends travel between the past, present, and future in their efforts to stop Mephiles and Iblis and protect Elise from Doctor Eggman. They learn that Mephiles seeks to bond with Iblis, as they are the two halves of Soleanna's omnipotent god, Solaris. Mephiles succeeds, but Sonic, Shadow, and Silver use the power of the Chaos Emeralds to transform into their <a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28series%29%23Super%20transformation">super forms</a> and defeat Solaris.

After finishing "<a href="Billy%20Hatcher%20and%20the%20Giant%20Egg">Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg</a>" (2003), <a href="Sonic%20Team">Sonic Team</a> began to plan its next project. Among the ideas the team was considering was a game with a realistic tone and an advanced <a href="physics%20engine">physics engine</a>. When <a href="Sega">Sega</a> reassigned the team to start working on a new game in the bestselling "Sonic" series, they decided to retain the realistic approach. "Sonic the Hedgehog" was conceived for <a href="Sixth%20generation%20of%20video%20game%20consoles">sixth generation</a> consoles, but Sonic Team realized its release would coincide with the series' 15th anniversary and decided to develop it for <a href="Seventh%20generation%20of%20video%20game%20consoles">seventh generation</a> consoles such as the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a>. Series co-creator and team lead <a href="Yuji%20Naka">Yuji Naka</a> wanted the first "Sonic" game for <a href="Seventh%20generation%20of%20video%20game%20consoles">seventh generation systems</a> to be a <a href="Reboot%20%28fiction%29">reboot</a> of the franchise. Naka noted the success of <a href="superhero%20film">superhero film</a>s such as "<a href="Spider-Man%202">Spider-Man 2</a>" (2004) and "<a href="Batman%20Begins">Batman Begins</a>" (2005)—which reached an audience far beyond fans of the comics those films were based on—and wanted to mimic this success. Thus, development of "Sonic the Hedgehog" began in late 2004. Sonic Team decided to use the same title as <a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%281991%20video%20game%29">the original 1991 game</a> that had launched the franchise to indicate that it would be a major advance from the previous games.

The <a href="Havok%20%28software%29">Havok</a> physics engine, previously used in their <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> game "<a href="Astro%20Boy%20%282004%20video%20game%29">Astro Boy</a>" (2004), allowed Sonic Team to create expansive levels previously impossible on earlier sixth generation consoles and experiment with multiple play-styles. In addition, the engine also enabled Sonic Team to experiment with aspects such as <a href="global%20illumination">global illumination</a>, a night-and day system, and giving Sonic new abilities like using ropes to leap into the air. Director <a href="Shun%20Nakamura">Shun Nakamura</a> demonstrated the engine during their stage shows at the <a href="Tokyo%20Game%20Show">Tokyo Game Show</a> (TGS) in 2005. As the hardware of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 was more powerful compared to the prior generation's consoles, the design team was able to create a more realistic setting than those of previous "Sonic" games. Sonic and Doctor Eggman were redesigned to better suit this updated environment: Sonic was made taller, with longer quills, and Eggman was made slimmer and given a more realistic appearance. Nakamura and producer Masahiro Kumono reasoned this was because the characters would be interacting with more humans, and felt it would make the game more appealing to older players. At one point, Sonic Team considered giving Sonic realistic fur and rubber textures.

While Sonic Team had a major focus on the visuals, they considered their primary challenge creating a game that was as appealing as the original <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Sega Genesis</a> "Sonic" games. They felt the preceding titles "<a href="Sonic%20Heroes">Sonic Heroes</a>" (2003) and "<a href="Shadow%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28video%20game%29">Shadow the Hedgehog</a>" (2005) had veered into different directions and wanted to return the series to its speed-based roots in new ways. For example, they wanted to include multiple paths in levels, like the Genesis games had, a goal the realistic environments helped achieve. Sonic Team sought to "aggressively" address problems with the <a href="virtual%20camera%20system">virtual camera system</a> from earlier "Sonic" games, something they had received many complaints about.

Silver the Hedgehog's gameplay style was born out of Sonic Team's desire to take advantage of Havok's realistic physics capabilities. The first design concept for Silver's character was an orange mink; he attained his final hedgehog look after over 50 design iterations. In designing Shadow's gameplay, the developers abandoned the concept of firearms previously used in "Shadow the Hedgehog" (2005) in favor of combat elements to differentiate him from the other characters. Shadow's gameplay was further fleshed out with the addition of vehicles; each vehicle uses its own physical engine. The game also features several <a href="Computer-generated%20imagery">CGI</a> cutscenes produced by <a href="Blur%20Studio">Blur Studio</a>. Animation supervisor Leo Santos said Blur faced challenges animating the opening scene due to the placement of Sonic's mouth.

As development progressed, Sonic Team faced serious problems, starting with Naka's resignation as head of Sonic Team to form his own company, <a href="Prope">Prope</a>. Naka has said he resigned because he did not want to continue making "Sonic" games and instead wished to focus on original properties. With his departure, "the heart and soul of Sonic" was gone, according to former Sega of America CEO <a href="Tom%20Kalinske">Tom Kalinske</a>. "Sonic the Hedgehog" was originally intended for release on all major seventh generation consoles as well as <a href="Windows">Windows</a>, but Sega was presented with development kits for <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>'s less powerful <a href="Wii">Wii</a> console. Sega believed <a href="porting">porting</a> the game to Wii would take too long, and so conceived a "Sonic" game that would use the <a href="motion%20detection">motion detection</a> function of <a href="Wii%20Remote">its controller</a>.

Therefore, the team was split in two: Nakamura led one team to finish "Sonic the Hedgehog" for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 while producer <a href="Yojiro%20Ogawa">Yojiro Ogawa</a> led the other to begin work on "<a href="Sonic%20and%20the%20Secret%20Rings">Sonic and the Secret Rings</a>" for the Wii. The split left an unusually small team to work on "Sonic the Hedgehog". Sega pressured the team to finish the game in time for the 2006 <a href="holiday%20shopping%20season">holiday shopping season</a>, so with the deadline quickly approaching, Sonic Team rushed the final stages of development, ignoring bug reports from Sega's quality assurance department and control problems. In retrospect, Ogawa noted that the final period proved to be a large challenge for the team. Not only was the Xbox 360 release imminent, but the PlayStation 3 launch was scheduled not long afterwards. This put tremendous pressure on the team to develop for both systems. Producer <a href="Takashi%20Iizuka%20%28game%20designer%29">Takashi Iizuka</a> similarly recalled, "we didn't have any time to polish and we were just churning out content as quick as we could."

The cast of the "<a href="Sonic%20X">Sonic X</a>" anime series reprised their voice roles for "Sonic the Hedgehog", and actress <a href="Lacey%20Chabert">Lacey Chabert</a> supplied the voice of series newcomer and <a href="damsel%20in%20distress">damsel in distress</a>, Princess Elise. The score for the game was primarily composed by <a href="Tomoya%20Ohtani">Tomoya Ohtani</a> along with <a href="Hideaki%20Kobayashi%20%28composer%29">Hideaki Kobayashi</a>, <a href="Mariko%20Nanba">Mariko Nanba</a>, Taihei Sato, and <a href="Takahito%20Eguchi">Takahito Eguchi</a>. It was the first "Sonic" game that Ohtani, who had previously contributed to "<a href="Sonic%20Heroes">Sonic Heroes</a>" (2003) and "Shadow the Hedgehog", worked on as sound director. The main theme for the game, the fantasy-rap song "His World", was performed by <a href="Ali%20Tabatabaee">Ali Tabatabaee</a> and <a href="Matty%20Lewis">Matty Lewis</a> of the band <a href="Zebrahead">Zebrahead</a>. <a href="Crush%2040">Crush 40</a> performed Shadow's theme, "All Hail Shadow", while vocalist Lee Brotherton sang Silver's theme, "Dreams of an Absolution". <a href="R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> artist <a href="Akon">Akon</a> performed a remix of the <a href="Dreams%20Come%20True%20%28band%29">Dreams Come True</a> song "Sweet Sweet Sweet", a song previously used as the ending theme to "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%202">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a>" (1992).

Because it was the first "Sonic" game for seventh generation consoles, Ohtani "aimed to emphasise that it was a epic next-generation title." Two soundtrack albums were released on January 10, 2007, under Sega's <a href="Wave%20Master">Wave Master</a> label: "Sonic the Hedgehog Vocal Traxx: Several Wills" and "Sonic the Hedgehog Original Soundtrack". "Vocal Traxx: Several Wills" contains seven songs; four are from the game, while the remaining three are remixes, including a version of "His World" performed by Crush 40. "Original Soundtrack" includes all 93 tracks featured in "Sonic the Hedgehog", spanning three discs.

"Sonic the Hedgehog" was announced in a closed-doors presentation at the <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> (E3) in May 2005. Later that year, at TGS in September, Naka revealed the game's title and said its release would correspond with the series' 15th anniversary. A demo version of the game was playable at E3 2006. A second demo, featuring a short section of Sonic's gameplay, was released via <a href="Xbox%20Live">Xbox Live</a> in September 2006. Sega released several packages of <a href="desktop%20wallpaper">desktop wallpaper</a> featuring characters from the game, and American publisher <a href="Prima%20Games">Prima Games</a> published an official strategy guide, written by Fletcher Black. Sega also made a deal with <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> to run advertisements for the game in <a href="Windows%20Live%20Messenger">Windows Live Messenger</a>.

The Xbox 360 version of "Sonic the Hedgehog" was released in North America on November 14, 2006, followed by a European release on November 24, 2006. Both versions were released in Japan on December 21, 2006. The PlayStation 3 version was released in North America on January 30, 2007, and in Europe on March 23, 2007. The game is often referred to by critics and fans with colloquial terms that reference its year of release, such as "Sonic 2006" or "Sonic 06".

In 2007, Sega released several packages of <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable content</a> that added features to single-player gameplay. These include a more difficult single-player mode and a continuous battle mode with all of the game's bosses back-to-back. One downloadable addition, "Team Attack Amigo" mode, sends players through a multitude of levels, changing to a different character every two or three levels and culminating in a boss fight. The PlayStation3 version was delayed to allow more time to incorporate the downloadable content, and thus launched alongside it.

The game was digitally rereleased via the <a href="Xbox%20Live%20Marketplace">Xbox Live Marketplace</a> on April 15, 2010. The following October, various "Sonic" games with average or below average scores on the <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregator</a> website <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, including "Sonic the Hedgehog", were delisted from retailers. Sega reasoned this was to avoid confusing customers and increase the value of the brand, following positive prerelease responses to "" and "<a href="Sonic%20Colors">Sonic Colors</a>" (both 2010).

"Sonic the Hedgehog" was well-received during prerelease showings. Reception to prior games "Sonic Heroes" and "Shadow the Hedgehog" had been mixed; after a number of well-received showings and demos, some felt "Sonic the Hedgehog" could be a return to the series' roots. "<a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>" said the game "showed a considerable amount of promise" after playing a demo at E3 2006, and "<a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>" praised its graphics and environments. In 2008 "<a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a>" said that it had looked "amazing" before its release.

At the time of release, the game received <a href="List%20of%20video%20games%20notable%20for%20negative%20reception">widespread negative reviews</a>. Metacritic classified both versions' reception as "generally unfavorable". Sega reported that the game sold strongly, with 870,000 units sold in the United States within six months. The Xbox 360 version was branded under the <a href="Platinum%20Hits">Platinum Hits</a> budget line.

Critics were divided on the game's presentation. "<a href="IGN">IGN</a>" called its graphics and audio "decent" and felt its interface and menu system worked well but lacked polish, but "GameSpot" said the graphics, while colorful, were bland and only a small improvement over sixth-generation games, a sentiment echoed by "<a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a>". "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" and "<a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>" noted several graphical glitches. "Eurogamer" also criticized the decision to continue the "<a href="Sonic%20Adventure">Sonic Adventure</a>" (1998) style of gameplay, believing that Sonic Team had learned nothing from the criticisms of past games.

Reviewers singled out the game's camera system, loading times, controls, level designs, and glitches. "GameSpot" said the level design was worsened by the frustrating camera system, and "Game Informer" criticized the game's high difficulty, citing the camera as causing most deaths. Some reviewers were unhappy that the majority of the game was not spent playing as Sonic; playing as Tails, "GameSpot" wrote, made a level boring. Similar criticism was offered by "Eurogamer", finding that the supporting cast annoyed rather than fleshing the game out; they considered the camera system to be the worst they had ever seen in a video game. On the positive side, "1UP" felt that despite the control and level design problems, the game still played like a "Sonic" game.

The plot was criticized as confusing and inappropriately dark. "GamesRadar" considered it overwrought and "conceptually challenged", and "Eurogamer" found its voice acting painful and its cutscenes cringeworthy. Some reviewers unfavorably compared the story to that of an <a href="anime">anime</a> or "<a href="Final%20Fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>". The romance between Sonic and the human Princess Elise was especially criticized; for "<a href="GamesTM">GamesTM</a>," it marked the point "the ["Sonic"] series had veered off into absolute nonsense."

"This ... is a mess from top to bottom", wrote "GameSpot", that "only the most blindly reverent "Sonic the Hedgehog" fan could possibly squeeze any enjoyment out of". "IGN" said that the game had some redeeming qualities, with brief segments of gameplay that demonstrated how a next-generation "Sonic" game could work, but found it "rips them away as soon as it shows them" and concluded that the game failed to reinvent the series. "Eurogamer" believed that "Sonic the Hedgehog"s mistakes would have been noticed if the game had been released in 1996.

Despite the mostly negative reception, "Game Informer" and <a href="Dave%20Halverson">Dave Halverson</a> of "<a href="Play%20%28US%20magazine%29">Play Magazine</a>" defended the game. "Game Informer" described it as ambitious and praised the graphics, story, amount of content, and <a href="replay%20value">replay value</a>, but believed only "Sonic" fans would enjoy the game. Halverson initially gave the Xbox360 version a 9.5/10, praising each character's controls and abilities and calling it the best 3D "Sonic" game yet. In the following issue, Halverson reassessed it as 8.5/10, writing that he had been told that the load times and glitches in his review copy would not be in the final version of the game. In a later review of the PlayStation3 version, Halverson was frustrated that the problems had still not been corrected and that the performance was worse despite the extra development time; Halverson gave this version a 5.5/10. "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" said in 2016 that despite its poor quality, the soundtrack has some "genuine rippers".

"<a href="GameTrailers">GameTrailers</a>" and "GamesRadar" considered "Sonic the Hedgehog" one of the most disappointing games of 2006. "GamesTM" singled out the game when it ranked the "Sonic" franchise at the top of their list of "Video Game Franchises That Lost Their Way". "The A.V. Club", "Kotaku", "Game Informer", and "<a href="USgamer">USgamer</a>" called the game the worst in the "Sonic" series, and the staff of "GamesRadar" named it among the worst video games of all time. The game remains popular for "<a href="Let%27s%20Play">Let's Play</a>" walkthroughs, with players showing off its glitches. The official "Sonic" <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> account also mocks the game. The failure of "Sonic the Hedgehog" led to the direction of the series being rethought. The next main "Sonic" game, 2008's <a href="Sonic%20Unleashed">"Unleashed"</a>, ignored the gritty and realistic tone of its predecessor. With "Unleashed"'s sequel "<a href="Sonic%20Colors">Sonic Colors</a>" (2010), "The A.V. Club" wrote, "the series rediscovered its strength for whimsical tales with light tones."

"Sonic the Hedgehog" introduced Silver the Hedgehog, Princess Elise, Mephiles, and Iblis to the franchise; most have made few appearances since. Silver is a playable character in "<a href="Sonic%20Rivals">Sonic Rivals</a>" (2006) and <a href="Sonic%20Rivals%202">its sequel</a>, in "" (2007), and in "<a href="Mario%20%26amp%3B%20Sonic%20at%20the%20Olympic%20Winter%20Games">Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games</a>" and its sequels, and is a minor character in the <a href="Nintendo%20DS">Nintendo DS</a> version of "Sonic Colors" (2010) and "<a href="Sonic%20Forces">Sonic Forces</a>" (2017). He also appeared in the "Sonic the Hedgehog" <a href="comic%20book">comic book</a> series published by <a href="Archie%20Comics">Archie Comics</a>. The main theme of "Sonic the Hedgehog", "His World", was sampled in <a href="Drake%20%28musician%29">Drake</a>'s 2017 song "<a href="KMT%20%28song%29">KMT</a>".

To celebrate the "Sonic" franchise's 20th anniversary in 2011, Sega released "<a href="Sonic%20Generations">Sonic Generations</a>", which remade aspects of past "Sonic" games. The PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Windows versions feature a remake of "Sonic the Hedgehog"s "Crisis City" level, and every version, including the <a href="Nintendo%203DS">Nintendo 3DS</a> version, includes a reimagined version of the boss battle with Silver. The decision to include "Sonic the Hedgehog" stages and bosses in "Sonic Generations" was criticized by critics and fans of the series; <a href="Jim%20Sterling">Jim Sterling</a> of "<a href="Destructoid">Destructoid</a>" referred to the Silver boss fight as the "catch" of the otherwise high-quality game.

In 2015, a fan group, Gistix, began developing a <a href="Video%20game%20remake">remake</a> for Windows using the <a href="Unity%20%28game%20engine%29">Unity</a> engine. A <a href="Game%20demo">demo</a> was released in January 2017, and was positively received by journalists. A second demo was released in late 2017, which "Eurogamer" called ambitious.
