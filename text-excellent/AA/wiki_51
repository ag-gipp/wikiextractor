Diorama (Silverchair album)

Diorama is the fourth <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by Australian <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> band <a href="Silverchair">Silverchair</a>, released on 31 March 2002 by <a href="Atlantic%20Records">Atlantic</a>/. It won the 2002 <a href="ARIA%20Music%20Awards%20of%202002">ARIA Music Award</a> for Best Group and Best Rock Album. The album was <a href="Record%20producer">co-produced</a> by <a href="Daniel%20Johns">Daniel Johns</a> and <a href="David%20Bottrill">David Bottrill</a>. While Bottrill had worked on albums for a variety of other bands, "Diorama" marked the first production credit for <a href="lead%20singer">lead singer</a> Johns.

Johns wrote most of the album at the <a href="piano">piano</a> instead of his usual guitar, while the band took a 12-month break following their previous studio album, "<a href="Neon%20Ballroom">Neon Ballroom</a>". Silverchair worked with composer <a href="Van%20Dyke%20Parks">Van Dyke Parks</a> on "Diorama"; the album contains numerous <a href="orchestra">orchestra</a>l arrangements and <a href="power%20ballad">power ballad</a>s, a change from the <a href="post-grunge">post-grunge</a> music typical of their earlier work, but consistent with the band's previous orchestrations on "<a href="Neon%20Ballroom">Neon Ballroom</a>". The album's title refers to "a world within a world". Five singles were released: "<a href="The%20Greatest%20View">The Greatest View</a>", "<a href="Without%20You%20%28Silverchair%20song%29">Without You</a>", "<a href="Luv%20Your%20Life">Luv Your Life</a>", "<a href="Across%20the%20Night">Across the Night</a>" and "After All These Years". All except "After All These Years", a promotional single, appeared on the <a href="ARIA%20Charts">Australian singles chart</a>.

"Diorama" was successful in the charts but was not as well received by critics as the band's earlier albums. It reached number one on the <a href="Australian%20Recording%20Industry%20Association">Australian Recording Industry Association</a> (ARIA) <a href="ARIA%20Charts">Albums Chart</a> and received a rating of 71 (out of 100) on review aggregator <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>. It was certified triple-platinum by ARIA, selling in excess of 210,000 copies, and won five <a href="ARIA%20Awards">ARIA Awards</a> in <a href="ARIA%20Music%20Awards%20of%202002">2002</a>. "Diorama" was nominated for Highest Selling Album in <a href="ARIA%20Music%20Awards%20of%202003">2003</a>, and three songs from the album were nominated for awards over the two years.

On "Diorama", Silverchair worked with a new producer, <a href="David%20Bottrill">David Bottrill</a>, who replaced <a href="Nick%20Launay">Nick Launay</a>. Though Launay had produced the band's three previous albums, lead singer Daniel Johns decided that he needed someone "who understood where he wanted to go". Johns believed "Diorama" would be "the kind of record that people were either going to be into or were really going to hate", and needed a producer who would understand the band's new direction. He interviewed several candidates, eventually choosing Bottrill and taking the role of co-producer himself.

Johns initially recorded eight songs, only to delete the files thinking they were too similar to tracks on the previous album, "<a href="Neon%20Ballroom">Neon Ballroom</a>". Leaving the security and darkness of his earlier work, he restarted from scratch to create something more uplifting. "Diorama" represented a radical change in Silverchair's musical structure; the heavy <a href="grunge">grunge</a> influence on their prior work was replaced by <a href="string%20%28music%29">string</a> and <a href="horn%20%28music%29">horn</a> ensembles and highly complex song structures. Johns felt more comfortable in making this radical change rather than a minor one, finding it helped him to regain his passion for music, which had diminished during the grunge days. Johns wrote much of the album at a <a href="grand%20piano">baby grand piano</a>; he had previously taught himself the instrument and composed songs on it for the first time with "Diorama". This change in songwriting technique had a significant effect on the sound of the album; Johns commented on the difference in how his vocals resonated with piano as compared to guitar. He worked with others in developing the album; <a href="Van%20Dyke%20Parks">Van Dyke Parks</a> (<a href="Beach%20Boys">Beach Boys</a>, <a href="U2">U2</a>) collaborated on <a href="orchestra">orchestra</a>l arrangements, and the pair spent much of their recording time attempting to describe the music in metaphorical terms, with Johns describing Parks' orchestral swells as "tidal waves" and violins as "a flock of birds". The pair described the collaborative experience as "mind-blowing". A <a href="DVD">DVD</a> entitled "Across the Night: The Creation of Diorama" was released in 2002, featuring interviews with Johns and Parks.

Several songs on "Diorama" were inspired by Johns' then-girlfriend <a href="Natalie%20Imbruglia">Natalie Imbruglia</a>, but he cautioned against possible misinterpretations of the songs, stating "Everyone will think that any lyric that's about someone in a positive light will be about her" and noting that there were other people he cared for about whom he wrote the songs. Johns denied rumours that he had written songs intending Imbruglia to sing them.

Silverchair intended to tour supporting "Diorama" following its release, but plans were postponed when Johns developed <a href="reactive%20arthritis">reactive arthritis</a>; causing his joints to <a href="Swelling%20%28medical%29">swell</a> and making guitar playing and singing too painful. After performing "<a href="The%20Greatest%20View">The Greatest View</a>" at the <a href="ARIA%20Music%20Awards%20of%202002">2002</a> <a href="ARIA%20Awards">ARIA Awards</a>, Johns said that he wanted "to perform ["Diorama"s] 11 songs at least once in front of an audience" before laying the album to rest. He travelled to <a href="California">California</a> to receive treatments for his arthritis, including daily <a href="physiotherapy">physiotherapy</a>.

Following a 31 March 2002 release on record label , "Diorama" reached number one on the <a href="ARIA%20Charts">ARIA Albums Chart</a> on 14 April, making it Silverchair's fourth chart-topping album. It went on to be certified triple-platinum by <a href="Australian%20Recording%20Industry%20Association">ARIA</a>, indicating sales in excess of 210,000 copies. The album peaked at number seven in New Zealand, thirteen in Austria, forty in Switzerland, and 116 in France. "Diorama" reached number ninety-one on the U.S. <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>.

The first <a href="single%20%28music%29">single</a>, "<a href="The%20Greatest%20View">The Greatest View</a>", was released in advance of the album on 28 January 2002. It reached number three in Australia, where it was also certified gold, and number four in New Zealand and Canada. It charted at number thirty-six on "Billboard's" <a href="Alternative%20Songs">Hot Modern Rock Tracks</a> in 2007 when re-released alongside the band's next album, "<a href="Young%20Modern">Young Modern</a>". Johns wrote "The Greatest View" as a response to the media "always watching [him] in different way". It was not intended to be aggressive, rather a straightforward commentary on the media frenzy that had surrounded the band for many years.

On 13 May 2002, "<a href="Without%20You%20%28Silverchair%20song%29">Without You</a>" was released as the second single. It peaked at number eight in Australia, but dropped to number twenty-nine the following week, only spending five weeks on the chart. The song was first announced by Silverchair <a href="bassist">bass guitarist</a> <a href="Chris%20Joannou">Chris Joannou</a> in November 1999, when he told fans the band had "a very small cache of recorded material stored away", including "Without You". "Without You" was followed by "<a href="Luv%20Your%20Life">Luv Your Life</a>", which peaked at number twenty in Australia after its 20 September release. The inspiration for the song came to Johns during a <a href="therapy">therapy</a> session, based on the idea that "there were people in the world who needed treatment but couldn't afford therapy." Johns composed most of the song's lyrics while listening to a therapist. In a performance at <a href="London">London</a>'s <a href="Shepherds%20Bush%20Empire">Shepherds Bush Empire</a>, Johns jokingly said "Luv Your Life" was dedicated "to all my ladies".

"After All These Years", a promotional single, followed "Luv Your Life", but failed to reach the charts. The final single "<a href="Across%20the%20Night">Across the Night</a>" was released on 11 March 2003. The song, which Johns wrote over nine hours on a sleepless night, peaked at number twenty-four on its three weeks on the Australian chart. The arrangement by Parks features twin <a href="Keyboard%20instrument">keyboards</a> and a string ensemble. The band's much-delayed tour in support of "Diorama" took its name from "Across the Night".

On 1 December 2002, a limited-edition CD <a href="box%20set">box set</a> was released as "The Diorama Box", consisting of the first three singles from the album as well as an exclusive single, "<a href="After%20All%20These%20Years%20%28Silverchair%20song%29">After All These Years</a>".

"Diorama" received a score of 71 out of 100 on review aggregator <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, based on nine reviews. Australian radio station <a href="Triple%20J">Triple J</a> listeners voted the album number one on their Top 10 Albums of 2002, while Triple J staff Rosie Beaton and Gaby Brown placed it third and fifth respectively.

Music magazine "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" gave "Diorama" four and a half stars in Australia and three out of five stars in the US. Reviewer <a href="Mark%20Kemp">Mark Kemp</a> praised Silverchair's development, saying that the band had developed a strong, independent musical ability, in contrast to their heavily influenced debut album, "<a href="Frogstomp">Frogstomp</a>". Kemp spoke highly of the "heavy orchestration, unpredictable melodic shifts and a whimsical pop sensibility", also noting Parks' arrangements gave the music "more breadth and depth". He argued that the album's strength was a product of Johns' confidence, resulting in high quality on "World Upon Your Shoulders", "Tuna in the Brine", and "After All These Years". However, "<a href="Without%20You%20%28Silverchair%20song%29">Without You</a>" saw Silverchair slip into "old habits", according to Kemp, and contained an "<a href="MTV">MTV</a>-approved hook".

Bradley Torreano, of review website <a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a>, gave "Diorama" four stars, labeling it an AMG Album Pick. He began by noting that Silverchair's improvement from the "Frogstomp" era was impressive, and that "Diorama" saw the band "finally growing into their own skin." Bottrill's production was praised, and the result likened to <a href="Big%20Country">Big Country</a> and <a href="U2">U2</a>, while Johns showcased "his rich voice and shockingly catchy tunes with a gusto missing from their earlier albums". Torreano's criticism was reserved for two songs on the album; he described the apparent <a href="Goo-Goo%20Dolls">Goo-Goo Dolls</a> influences on "Without You" as "an unwelcome twist", and felt that on "One Way Mule", the band reverted "back to their grunge sound".

James Jam, of music magazine "<a href="NME">NME</a>", was critical of "Diorama", calling it "over-produced Aussie rock". Jam compared Silverchair to <a href="Bryan%20Adams">Bryan Adams</a> in their attempt to "venture boldly into exciting new musical landscapes". "Tuna in the Brine" was "grossly pretentious and overblown", while he saw the album as a whole as inoffensive, especially in comparison to the band's past post-grunge. According to Jam, the band were not trying to make a mature musical statement with the album, but rather to "impress their parents".

Nikki Tranter of pop-music website <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> called the album mature, praising everything from the cover art to the "finely crafted pop melodies". Tranter praised "Diorama" for standing out in the "very similar" Australian music scene. The majority of songs on the album were rated highly; she thought "<a href="The%20Greatest%20View">The Greatest View</a>" was a stand-out with "orchestral twangs", and "After All These Years" had "sweeping horns, introspective lyrics and soft, haunting vocals".

Rob O'Connor of <a href="Yahoo%21">Yahoo!</a>'s <a href="Yahoo%21%20Music">music website</a> gave "Diorama" a positive review, agreeing that the band had matured greatly since their early high school releases. The pop songs on the album, "Luv Your Life" and "Too Much of Not Enough", were said to "glide", and O'Connor praised Johns for "whisper[ing] his lyrics with grace and subtlety" where in the past he would "shout in angst", drawing comparisons to <a href="Elliott%20Smith">Elliott Smith</a>. His main critique of the album was that it still contained some "obligatory 'grunge' efforts"; he felt eliminating those would allow the band to reach its full potential.

"Diorama" charted highest in Australia; spending 50 weeks on the <a href="ARIA%20Charts">ARIA Albums Chart</a> including a week at number one. This popularity was not matched in other countries; it spent 10 weeks or less on all other charts, though reaching number seven in New Zealand.

Fulvous whistling duck

The fulvous whistling duck or fulvous tree duck ("Dendrocygna bicolor") is a species of <a href="whistling%20duck">whistling duck</a> that breeds across the world's tropical regions in much of <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> and <a href="South%20America">South America</a>, the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a>, the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">Southern United States</a>, <a href="sub-Saharan%20Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a> and the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a>. It has <a href="plumage">plumage</a> that is mainly reddish brown, long legs and a long grey bill, and shows a distinctive white band across its black tail in flight. Like other members of its ancient lineage, it has a whistling call which is given in flight or on the ground. Its preferred <a href="habitat">habitat</a> consists of <a href="wetlands">wetlands</a> with plentiful vegetation, including shallow lakes and <a href="paddy%20fields">paddy fields</a>.
The nest, built from plant material and unlined, is placed among dense vegetation or in a tree hole. The typical <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> is around ten whitish eggs. The breeding adults, which pair for life, take turns to incubate, and the eggs hatch in 24–29 days. The downy grey ducklings leave the nest within a day or so of hatching, but the parents continue to protect them until they <a href="fledge">fledge</a> around nine weeks later.

The fulvous whistling duck feeds in wetlands by day or night on seeds and other parts of plants. It is sometimes regarded as a pest of rice cultivation, and is also shot for food in parts of its range. Despite hunting, poisoning by <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s and natural predation by mammals, birds and reptiles, the large numbers and huge range of this duck mean that it is classified as <a href="Least-concern%20species">least concern</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a>.

The <a href="whistling%20duck">whistling duck</a>s, "Dendrocygna", are a distinctive group of eight bird species within the duck, goose and swan family, <a href="Anatidae">Anatidae</a>, which are characterised by a hump-backed, long-necked appearance and the whistled flight calls that give them their English name. They were an early split from the main duck lineage, and were predominant in the <a href="Late%20Miocene">Late Miocene</a> before the subsequent extensive radiation of more modern forms in the <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a> and later. The fulvous whistling duck forms a <a href="superspecies">superspecies</a> with the <a href="wandering%20whistling%20duck">wandering whistling duck</a>. It has no recognised <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>, although the birds in northern Mexico and the southern US have in the past been assigned to "D. b. helva", described as having paler and brighter underparts and a lighter crown than "D. b. bicolor".

The duck was first described by <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20Gmelin">Johann Friedrich Gmelin</a> in 1789 and given the name "Anas fulva" but the name was "preoccupied," or already used, by <a href="Friedrich%20Christian%20Meuschen">Friedrich Christian Meuschen</a> in 1787 for another species. This led to the next available name proposed by French <a href="ornithology">ornithologist</a> <a href="Louis%20Jean%20Pierre%20Vieillot">Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot</a> in 1816 from a Paraguayan specimen as "Anas bicolor". The whistling ducks were moved to their current genus, "Dendrocygna", by British <a href="ornithology">ornithologist</a> <a href="William%20John%20Swainson">William John Swainson</a> in recognition of their differences from other ducks. The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek "dendron", "tree", and Latin "cygnus", "swan", and " bicolor" is Latin for "two-coloured". "<a href="Fulvous">Fulvous</a>" means reddish-yellow, and is derived from the Latin equivalent "fulvus". Old and regional names include large whistling teal, brown tree duck, <a href="Mexican%20duck">Mexican duck</a>, pichiguila, squealer and Spanish cavalier.

The fulvous whistling duck is long; the male weighs , and the female averages marginally lighter at . It is a long-legged duck, mainly golden-brown with a darker back and an obvious blackish line down the back of its neck. It has whitish stripes on its flanks, a long grey bill and grey legs. In flight, the wings are brown above and black below, with no white markings, and a white crescent on the rump contrasts with the black tail. All plumages are fairly similar, but the female is slightly smaller and duller-plumaged than the male. The juvenile has paler underparts, and appears generally duller, especially on the flanks. There is a complete wing <a href="moulting">moult</a> after breeding, and birds then seek the cover of dense wetland vegetation while they are flightless. Body feathers may be moulted throughout the year; each feather is replaced only once annually.

These are noisy <a href="bird">bird</a>s with a clear whistling "kee-wee-ooo" call given on the ground or in flight. Quarrelling birds also have a harsh repeated "kee". In flight, the beating wings produce a dull sound. The calls of males and females show differences in structure and an acoustic analysis on 59 captive birds demonstrated 100% accuracy in sexing when compared with molecular methods.

Adult birds in Asia can be confused with the similar <a href="lesser%20whistling%20duck">lesser whistling duck</a>, which is smaller, has a blackish crown and lacks an obvious dark stripe down the back of the neck. Juvenile fulvous whistling ducks are very like young lesser whistling ducks, but the crown colour is still a distinction. Juvenile <a href="comb%20duck">comb duck</a>s are bulkier than whistling ducks and have a dark cap to the head. In South America and Africa, juvenile <a href="white-faced%20whistling%20duck">white-faced whistling duck</a>s are separable from fulvous by their dark crowns, barred flanks and chestnut breasts.

The fulvous whistling duck has a very large range extending across four continents. It breeds in lowland South America from northern Argentina to Colombia and then up to the southern US and the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a>. It is found in a broad belt across <a href="sub-Saharan%20Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a> and down the east of the continent to <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a> and <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. The <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a> is the Asian stronghold. It undertakes seasonal <a href="bird%20migration">movements</a> in response to the availability of water and food. African birds move southwards in the southern summer to breed and return north in the winter, and Asian populations are highly nomadic due to the variability of rainfall. This species has strong colonising tendencies, having expanded its range in Mexico, the US and the West Indies in recent decades. Wandering birds can turn up far beyond the normal range, sometimes staying to nest, as in Morocco, Peru and Hawaii.

The fulvous whistling duck is found in lowland marshes and swamps in open, flat country, and it avoids wooded areas. It is particularly attracted to wetlands with plenty of emergent vegetation, including rice fields. It is not normally a mountain species, breeding in Venezuela, for example, only up , but the single Peruvian breeding record was at .

This species is usually found in small groups, but substantial flocks can form at favoured sites. It walks well, without waddling, and normally feeds by upending, though it can dive if necessary. It does not often perch in trees, unlike other whistling ducks. It flies at low altitude with slow wingbeats and trailing feet, in loose flocks rather than tight formation. It feeds during the day and at night in fairly large flocks, often with other whistling duck species, but rests or sleeps in smaller groups in the middle of the day. They are noisy and display their aggression towards other individuals by throwing back their heads. Before taking off in alarm, they often shake their head sideways.

Several <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a> parasites have been recorded on this duck, including <a href="Mallophaga">chewing mites</a> of the families <a href="Philopteridae">Philopteridae</a> and <a href="Menoponidae">Menoponidae</a>, <a href="feather%20mite">feather mite</a>s and skin <a href="mite">mite</a>s. Internal <a href="helminths">helminth</a> parasites include <a href="nematode">roundworms</a>, <a href="cestoda">tapeworms</a> and <a href="trematoda">flukes</a>. In a survey in Florida, all 30 ducks tested carried at least two helminth species; none had blood parasites. Only one duck had no mites or lice.

Breeding coincides with the availability of water. In South America and South Africa, the main nesting period is December–February, in <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> it is July–December, and in North America mid-May–August. In India, the breeding season is from June to October but peaking in July and August. Fulvous whistling ducks show lifelong <a href="monogamy">monogamy</a>; the courtship display is limited to some mutual head-dipping before mating and a short dance after copulation in which the birds raise their bodies side-by-side while treading water.

Pairs may breed alone or in loose groups. In South Africa, nests may be within of each other, and breeding densities of up to 13.7 nests per square kilometre (35.5 per square mile) have been found in <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>. The nest, across, is made from plant leaves and stems and has little or no soft lining. It is usually built in dense vegetation and close to water, but sometimes in tree holes. In India, the use of tree holes, and even the old nests of <a href="bird%20of%20prey">raptors</a> or <a href="crow">crow</a>s, is much more common than elsewhere. Eggs are laid at roughly 24- to 36-hour intervals, starting before the nest is complete, resulting in some losses from the <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a>. They are whitish and on average measure and weigh . The clutch is usually around ten eggs, but other females <a href="brood%20parasitism">sometimes lay into the nest</a>, so 20 or more may be found on occasion. Eggs may also be added to the nests of other species, like <a href="ruddy%20duck">ruddy duck</a>.

Both sexes incubate, changing over once a day, with the male often taking the greater share of this duty. The eggs hatch in about 24–29 days, The downy ducklings are grey, with paler upperparts, and a white band on the neck, and weigh within a day of hatching. Like all ducklings, they are <a href="precocial">precocial</a> and leave the nest after a day or so, but the parents protect them until they <a href="fledge">fledge</a> around nine weeks later. Eggs and duckling may be preyed on by mammals, birds and reptiles; one parent may try to distract a potential predator with a broken-wing display while the other adult leads the ducklings away. Birds are sexually mature after one year, and the maximum known age is 6.5 years.

In South Africa, a few records of hybridization with the <a href="white-faced%20whistling%20duck">white-faced whistling duck</a> have been noted in the wild; in most parts of southern <a href="Africa">Africa</a>, the two species breed at different times, "bicolor" during the dry season (April to September) and "viduata" during the rains (October to March). Hybridization in captivity is more frequent but limited to other species in the genus "Dendrocygna".

The fulvous whistling duck feeds in wetlands by day or night, often in <a href="Mixed-species%20foraging%20flock">mixed flocks</a> with relatives such as white-faced or <a href="black-bellied%20whistling%20duck">black-bellied whistling duck</a>s. Its food is generally plant material, including seeds, bulbs, grasses and stems, but females may include animal items such as <a href="Oligochaeta">aquatic worms</a>, <a href="Mollusca">molluscs</a> and insects as they prepare for egg-laying, which may then comprise up to 4% of their diet. Ducklings may also eat a few insects. Foraging is by picking plant items while walking or swimming, by upending, or occasionally by diving to a depth of up to . Favoured plants include <a href="Nymphoides">water snowflake</a>, aquatic <a href="ragweed">ragweed</a>s, <a href="Echinochloa%20stagnina">bourgou millet</a>, <a href="Echinochloa%20colona">shama grass</a>, <a href="Nymphaea%20capensis">Cape blue water lily</a>, <a href="Solanum%20glaucophyllum">waxy-leaf nightshade</a>, <a href="Rhynchospora">beakrush</a>, <a href="Cyperus%20iria">flatsedge</a> and <a href="polygonum">polygonum</a>s. Rice is normally a small part of the diet, and a survey in Cuban rice fields found that the plants taken were mainly weeds growing with the crop. However, in a study in Louisiana, 25% of the diet of incubating females consisted of cereal.

The <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) estimates the population of the fulvous whistling duck to be from 1.3–1.5 million individuals around the world. This may be an underestimate since regional assessments suggest 1 million birds in the Americas, 1.1 million in Africa and at least 20,000 in South Asia for a grand total of 2.12 million ducks around the world. The population appears to be declining, but the decrease is not rapid enough to trigger the vulnerability criteria for extinction. The large numbers and huge breeding range mean that this duck is classified by the IUCN as being of <a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a>. It is one of the species to which the "Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds" (<a href="AEWA">AEWA</a>) applies.

The fulvous whistling duck has expanded its range in the West Indies, and into the southern US. A series of invasions from South America and reaching the eastern US commenced around 1948, fueled by rice cultivation, and breeding was recorded in Cuba in 1964, and Florida in 1965. Some Florida birds still winter in Cuba. In Africa, it bred on the <a href="Cape%20Peninsula">Cape Peninsula</a> between 1940 and the 1960s. A survey of eighteen species which had colonised the area in recent decades found that most were wetland species that had used irrigated farmland as "stepping stones" across the arid country separating the peninsula from the breeding main range. However, the status of the two whistling duck species featured in the research is dubious since they are popular ornamental species, so their origin is unclear.

Outside North America it is subject to hunting for food or because of its liking for rice, and persecution means that it is now rare in Madagascar. Pesticides used on rice fields may also have an adverse impact, causing liver and breast muscle damage even at sub-lethal levels.

Red wattlebird

The red wattlebird ("Anthochaera carunculata") is a <a href="passerine">passerine</a> bird native to southern Australia. At in length, it is the second largest species of Australian <a href="honeyeater">honeyeater</a>. It has mainly grey-brown plumage, with red eyes, distinctive pinkish-red <a href="Wattle%20%28anatomy%29">wattles</a> on either side of the neck, white streaks on the chest and a large bright yellow patch on the lower belly. The sexes are similar in plumage. Juveniles have less prominent wattles and browner eyes. <a href="John%20White%20%28surgeon%29">John White</a> described the red wattlebird in 1790; three <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> are recognized.

The species is found in southeast <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>, <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> and southwest <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a> in open forest and woodland, and is a common visitor to urban gardens and parks. Loud and conspicuous, the red wattlebird is generally found in trees, where it gets most of its food; occasionally it forages on the ground. It is one of the largest <a href="Nectarivore">nectarivorous</a> birds in the world, feeding from a wide variety of flowering plants. Insects also comprise part of its diet. It is territorial and at times aggressive to birds of other species, often defending rich sources of nectar. Breeding throughout its range, the red wattlebird builds a cup-shaped nest in a tree and raises one to two broods a year. Although it has declined in places from <a href="land%20clearing">land clearing</a>, it is classified as Least Concern on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>.

The red wattlebird was first described as the wattled bee-eater by the Irish surgeon and naturalist <a href="John%20White%20%28surgeon%29">John White</a> in his "Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales", which was published in 1790. He wrote that it was the "size of a <a href="Mistle%20thrush">missel thrush</a>, but much larger in proportion". The taxonomic descriptions in White's book are believed to have been written by the English naturalist <a href="George%20Shaw">George Shaw</a>, who is generally credited as the author by subsequent authorities. The <a href="specific%20epithet%20%28zoology%29">specific epithet</a>, "carunculata", was introduced later in the same year by <a href="John%20Latham%20%28ornithologist%29">John Latham</a>. The word is derived from "caruncula", Latin for a small piece of flesh. Both Shaw and Latham assigned the red wattlebird to the genus "<a href="Merops%20%28genus%29">Merops</a>". The species was moved to "<a href="Anthochaera">Anthochaera</a>" in 1827 by the naturalists <a href="Nicholas%20Aylward%20Vigors">Nicholas Aylward Vigors</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Horsfield">Thomas Horsfield</a>.

Common names include gillbird, gilly warbler, barkingbird, muttonbird, butcherbird, what's o clock and chock. Unlike many species in southwestern Australia, the red wattlebird was given names by the local indigenous people that were <a href="onomatopoeic">onomatopoeic</a> (sounding like the calls they make). Names recorded include "wodjalok", "durdal", "doongorok", and "djoongong" (this last name is also applied to the <a href="western%20wattlebird">western wattlebird</a>). In the <a href="Eyre%20Peninsula">Eyre Peninsula</a> in South Australia, the local <a href="Barngarla%20people">Barngarla people</a> knew it as "ngarkarko" or "ngarkabukko". The local people of <a href="Denial%20Bay">Denial Bay</a> in South Australia called it "noggal", and the <a href="Ngarrindjeri">Ngarrindjeri</a> people of the Lower Murray region in South Australia knew it as "rungkan".

There are three recognised <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>, though there is a zone of intermediate birds across western <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> and eastern <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>, bordered by western <a href="Port%20Phillip%20Bay">Port Phillip Bay</a> to the east, <a href="Mount%20Lofty%20Ranges">Mount Lofty Ranges</a> to the West and <a href="Little%20Desert%20National%20Park">Little</a> and <a href="Big%20Desert%20Wilderness%20Park">Big Desert</a> parks to the north. The differences in plumage are not generally prominent enough to be noticeable in the field.


Analysis of <a href="DNA">DNA</a> showed that the closest relative of the red wattlebird is the <a href="yellow%20wattlebird">yellow wattlebird</a> of <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>, the pair splitting from the ancestor of the <a href="regent%20honeyeater">regent honeyeater</a>—their next closest relative. Honeyeaters are related to the <a href="Pardalotidae">Pardalotidae</a> (pardalotes), <a href="Acanthizidae">Acanthizidae</a> (Australian warblers, scrubwrens, thornbills, etc.), and <a href="Maluridae">Maluridae</a> (Australian fairy-wrens) in the large <a href="Meliphagoidea">Meliphagoidea</a> superfamily.

The sexes of the red wattlebird are similar in size and <a href="plumage">plumage</a>, the length of the adult male ranging from and adult female . With an average weight of , the red wattlebird is one of the largest nectar-feeding birds in the world, and second largest species of honeyeater native to Australia, eclipsed only by the yellow wattlebird. The <a href="Crown%20%28anatomy%29">crown</a>, forehead and upper <a href="Lore%20%28anatomy%29">lores</a> (area between the eyes and nostrils) are dark brown, streaked with pale brown at the front of the crown and white at the rear of the crown. The <a href="nape">nape</a> (back of the neck) is slightly paler brown, with white streaks. A whitish triangular marking covers the lower lores and anterior ear <a href="covert%20feather">covert feather</a>s, bordered below by a dark brown stripe from the lower mandible down to the wattle and around to behind the eye. The throat is dark brown streaked with white. The <a href="Iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a> of the eye is orange-red to crimson. The distinctive pinkish-red <a href="Wattle%20%28anatomy%29">wattles</a> dangle from the lower rear corner of the ear coverts on either side of the neck, and there is a sliver of pink bare skin at the lower border of the white patch on the face. The chest and belly are streaked white, and there is a bright yellow patch towards the tail. The strong legs and feet are pink or pinkish-brown and the downward-curving bill is black. The average length of the bill is around , and wide and high at its base. The <a href="Beak%23Gape">gape</a> is grey-black, while the inside of the mouth is orange. In common with other honeyeaters, the red wattlebird has a long specialized tongue to extract nectar from flowers. The tongue can extend well beyond the tip of the bill and is divided at the end to form a brush-like structure with over a hundred bristles that soak up nectar by capillary action.

The red wattlebird begins <a href="moulting">moulting</a> after the breeding season, starting with the <a href="Flight%20feather%23Primaries">primary flight feathers</a> in November or December and finishing between the following March and May. The feathers of the breast, back, median and lesser covert feathers are moulted before those of the crown, <a href="Flight%20feather%23Remiges">remiges</a> and <a href="Flight%20feather%23Rectrices">retrices</a>.

Immature red wattlebirds are generally less flamboyant. Juveniles have much less prominent wattles, brown irises, a pale crown and much less yellow on the belly. They moult into first immature plumage within a few months of leaving the nest. First immature birds are more similar to adults overall, having red irises with brown rings, wattles larger but still smaller than adults, and a greyish pink gape.

The red wattlebird is hard to confuse with any other species, though in poor visibility might be mistaken for the <a href="spiny-cheeked%20honeyeater">spiny-cheeked honeyeater</a>, or <a href="little%20wattlebird">little</a> or western wattlebirds.

Red wattlebirds are noisy animals, producing a range of raucous calls. Pairs of birds appear to duet, particularly at food sources, with the male producing a loud cackle and the female a whistling call. The male's cackle is loudest between 1 and 3 kHz frequency. A guttural-sounding call, it has been variously described as having a squawking, coughing or hiccuping sound. Males cackle when foraging by themselves, when with other birds, or when declaring their territory to other birds. The whistling call consists of up to five rapid whistles that may or may not ascend in tone and are repeated 3–4 times. Both sexes commonly utter a single "chock" note that may be harsh and guttural or have 4–5 <a href="harmonic">harmonic</a>s. This is thought to be a <a href="contact%20call">contact call</a>. These calls all carry over long distances.

Red wattlebirds utter two types of alarm calls, alternating between them while <a href="Mobbing%20%28animal%20behavior%29">mobbing</a> other animals. One is a harsh call over a wide frequency (1.3 to 5.9 kHz) that is louder at lower frequencies. The other a lower-pitched <a href="staccato">staccato</a> call with a frequency of 1.1–2.2 kHz. They give a harsh call when trying to distract intruders from the vicinity of the nest or when picked up, often trying to flap or peck the handler.

The red wattlebird is found in southeast Queensland, where it occurs south of <a href="Shire%20of%20Noosa">Noosa</a> and <a href="Cooloola%2C%20Queensland">Cooloola</a>, becoming more common south of Brisbane and <a href="Toowoomba">Toowoomba</a>. Further south into New South Wales it is found most places east of (and including) the <a href="Great%20Dividing%20Range">Great Dividing Range</a> and stretching west to the southern North-West Plain, Central Western Slopes and eastern <a href="Riverina">Riverina</a>, and is an occasional visitor to points along the Murray River valley. It is found across Victoria, though is uncommon in the northwest of the state. In South Australia, Devonborough Downs Station, Manunda, <a href="Wilpena%20Pound">Wilpena Pound</a> and Nullarbor Station mark the northern limits of its range. There are scattered records from the <a href="Nullarbor%20Plain">Nullarbor Plain</a>, but the species is common in <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a> west of 125 °E and south of 29 °S. The yellow wattlebird replaces it in Tasmania. The red wattlebird has become more common in some localities, such as the <a href="Sunraysia">Sunraysia</a> district in the 1960s and <a href="Nambucca%20Heads%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Nambucca Heads</a> and <a href="Lefevre%20Peninsula">Lefevre Peninsula</a> in the 1980s. Numbers breeding have increased in Sydney and Adelaide. The red wattlebird is a rare <a href="Vagrancy%20%28biology%29">vagrant</a> to New Zealand, with confirmed records at <a href="Matakana">Matakana</a> in 1865 and Rohutu, <a href="Taranaki">Taranaki</a> in 1885, and a third unconfirmed from <a href="Motupiko%20River">Motupiko</a> in 1938.

The red wattlebird appears to be a permanent resident in much of its range, though its movements are poorly known. It appears to be partly migratory in Western Australia and the north coast of New South Wales. In southeastern New South Wales and the <a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Australian Capital Territory</a>, it appears to move to lower altitudes for winter. For instance, birds vacate the <a href="Brindabella%20Range">Brindabella Range</a> over the cooler months. Overall, little pattern is discernible in the species' movements, though red wattlebirds appear to move to feed on populations of flowering <a href="banksias">banksias</a> and <a href="eucalypts">eucalypts</a>, such as winter-flowering banksias in Perth over the cooler months. Large numbers arrive in time to feed on flowering native apples ("<a href="Angophora">Angophora</a>") in Mudgee and Cobbora districts in central-western New South Wales, and on white box ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20albens">Eucalyptus albens</a>") at <a href="Barrington%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Barrington</a> in central-northern New South Wales. A mainly resident population on the <a href="Swan%20Coastal%20Plain">Swan Coastal Plain</a> north of Perth is supplemented during winter by more arriving from inland areas. South of Perth, red wattlebirds are more locally nomadic, moving to new patches of blooming wildflowers. East of Perth in areas around <a href="Kellerberrin%2C%20Western%20Australia">Kellerberin</a>, <a href="Kwolyin%2C%20Western%20Australia">Kwolyin</a> and <a href="Nangeenan%2C%20Western%20Australia">Nangeenan</a>, the red wattlebird is present from late autumn to spring, breeding in August and September. Around <a href="Lake%20Grace">Lake Grace</a>, the red wattlebird is present year-round.

Open <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forest and woodland, generally dominated by eucalypts, is the most common habitat of the species. It is more common in forests with ample shrubby or grassy <a href="understory">understory</a>. It is less commonly encountered in <a href="shrubland">shrubland</a>, <a href="heath">heath</a>, or margins of wet sclerophyll forest. It is rarely found in mature pine <a href="plantation">plantation</a>s. Within urban areas, it is abundant in parks and reserves, gardens and golf courses, as well as orchards and vineyards. It occasionally ventures into <a href="Subtropics">subtropical</a>, <a href="Semi-arid%20climate">semi-arid</a> or <a href="Montane%20ecosystems%23Subalpine%20zone">subalpine</a> regions, and has been found up to above sea level. The red wattlebird is rarer in forests that have been affected by dieback (infection by the pathogen "<a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">Phytophthora cinnamomi</a>").

A loud and active bird, the red wattlebird is found in pairs, in a small family group, or alone during the breeding season, and gathers in larger groups of up to several hundred birds over winter. It flies straight or with a slightly undulating pattern, alternating between gliding and flapping its wings with quick shallow beats, at or slightly above the level of the tree canopy. The red wattlebird moves on the ground by hopping, cocking its tail upwards slightly.

Aggressive and territorial, the red wattlebird defends its nest and sources of food against other birds. It either calls at, snaps at the tails of, or flies at other birds, sometimes scuffling with members of the same species or other large honeyeaters in the air. "Displacement" is a dominant display in which a red wattlebird will land on a perch that has been immediately vacated by another bird. A smaller red wattlebird adopts a horizontal "appeasement posture" side-on to the aggressor in which it lowers its head, flutters its wings and edges closer to the other bird. 
As well as smaller bird species, red wattlebirds can mob and chase larger species such as the <a href="Australian%20magpie">Australian magpie</a> ("Gymnorhina tibicen"), <a href="butcherbird">butcherbird</a>s and <a href="currawong">currawong</a>s, the <a href="black-faced%20cuckooshrike">black-faced cuckooshrike</a> ("Coracina novaehollandiae"), the <a href="olive-backed%20oriole">olive-backed oriole</a> ("Oriolus sagittatus"), crows and ravens, the <a href="laughing%20kookaburra">laughing kookaburra</a> ("Dacelo novaeguineae") and even small raptors like the <a href="collared%20sparrowhawk">collared sparrowhawk</a> ("Accipiter cirrocephalus").

The red wattlebird breeds throughout its range, with nesting taking place between July and December, though occasionally outside these months if conditions are favourable. One or two broods are laid each year.

Birds generally nest as solitary pairs. The nest is a cup-shaped structure formed from sticks and leaves lined with bark, grass and hair, between above ground, usually in the forked branches of a tree—generally a eucalypt. The nest is generally centrally located rather than in the periphery of the tree. A study in Eastwood State Forest near <a href="Armidale%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Armidale</a> in New South Wales found that red wattlebirds preferred to nest in manna gum ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20viminalis">Eucalyptus viminalis</a>") and apple box ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20bridgesiana">E. bridgesiana</a>").

A clutch of two or three pale brown- and lavender-spotted pinkish eggs are normally laid. They measure and are a tapered oval in shape. The eggs are normally incubated by both parents, but sometimes just by the female. They hatch after 16–21 days. The chicks are born almost naked with a small amount of grey down on their head and body. They are mostly brooded by the female but sometimes the male will also do so. The nestlings are fed by both parents, and occasionally immature birds will also contribute. Their eyes open at around 7 days. They fledge 15–20 days after hatching and both parents continue to feed them for a further 2–3 weeks. Young are given manna (crystallised plant <a href="sap">sap</a>) and insects such as beetles, bugs and flies.

The red wattlebird is predominantly a nectar-feeder, foraging mostly in trees, in particular climbing along branches (rather than the trunk) and at flower heads, and probing flowers with its bill. One study in Bondi State Forest in southern New South Wales revealed that the species foraged at a height of . They seldom look for food on the ground, though do so to feed on shrubs such as the cats paw ("<a href="Anigozanthos%20humilis">Anigozanthos humilis</a>"). The red wattlebird prioritises visiting flowers that produce a lot of nectar, such as those of eucalypts, banksias, grasstrees ("<a href="Xanthorrhoea">Xanthorrhoea</a>") and emu bushes ("<a href="Eremophila%20%28plant%29">Eremophila</a>"). It often prefers plants with easy access to nectar rather than those with tubular flowers (and thus difficult-to-access nectar). The red wattlebird seeks out yellow flower heads of holly-leaved banksia ("<a href="Banksia%20ilicifolia">Banksia ilicifolia</a>"), which have much higher nectar content than the more mature red flower heads. The species forages much more often in native than <a href="Introduced%20species">exotic</a> plants, though the introduced coral tree ("<a href="Erythrina">Erythrina</a>") is popular. In addition to nectar, it takes insects and other small creatures, usually by <a href="hawking%20%28birds%29">hawking</a>, and also <a href="berry">berries</a> and other fruit. A field study in the Mount Lofty Ranges found that it spent twice as much time feeding on nectar compared to insects.

One field study found that red wattlebirds foraged for longer periods when nectar concentrations in flowers were low, and consumed fewer insects at this time. However, this could have been because the temperature was lower and hence insects were less active. In <a href="Gingin%2C%20Western%20Australia">Gingin, Western Australia</a>, 97% of red wattlebirds at a site of two mixed kangaroo paw species were observed feeding on a single species at its peak flowering: cats paw in August and red-and-green kangaroo paw ("<a href="Anigozanthos%20manglesii">A. manglesii</a>") in September, with very few visits to the other species or hybrids.

In central New South Wales, the red wattlebird forages more often on the foliage of the grey gum ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20punctata">Eucalyptus punctata</a>") over other trees, though it does also show some preference for narrow-leaved ironbark ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20crebra">E. crebra</a>") if grey gum is not present. Red wattlebirds tend to oust <a href="noisy%20friarbird">noisy friarbird</a>s ("Philemon corniculatus") if both species were present. The red wattlebird often forages alongside the <a href="New%20Holland%20honeyeater">New Holland honeyeater</a> ("Phylidonyris novaehollandiae"), <a href="little%20friarbird">little friarbird</a> ("P. citreogularis"), western and little wattlebirds, <a href="rainbow%20lorikeet">rainbow lorikeet</a> ("Trichoglossus moluccanus"), <a href="purple-crowned%20lorikeet">purple-crowned lorikeet</a> ("Glossopsitta porphyrocephala"), <a href="satin%20bowerbird">satin bowerbird</a> ("Ptilonorhynchus violaceus"), <a href="pied%20currawong">pied currawong</a> ("Strepera graculina") and <a href="crimson%20rosella">crimson rosella</a> ("Platycercus elegans"), though they generally chase other nectar-feeding birds away from a horde of eucalypt flowers.

A field study conducted in winter 1978 on Kangaroo Island found red wattlebirds to be territorial around a rich source of nectar, namely a large cup gum ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20cosmophylla">Eucalyptus cosmophylla</a>"), driving off smaller honeyeaters. This indicated the species would exclude other species if food was scarce. In New England National Park, red wattlebirds would be more aggressive if there were moderate amounts of nectar in groves of flowering banksias but less so at lean or abundant times.

The red wattlebird has a brush-tipped tongue, with a long segment bearing around 120 individual bristles. It feeds by placing the bill in a flower and inserting the tongue into its nectar chamber, drawing the nectar up by capillary action. The bristles increase the surface area of the tongue available for the uptake of nectar.

The nests of red wattlebirds are often <a href="Brood%20parasite">parasitized</a> by the <a href="pallid%20cuckoo">pallid cuckoo</a> ("Cacomantis pallidus"), and less commonly by the <a href="Pacific%20koel">Pacific koel</a> ("Eudynamys orientalis"). Nest predators include the <a href="brown%20goshawk">brown goshawk</a> ("Accipiter fasciatus"), <a href="black%20falcon">black falcon</a> ("Falco subniger"), pied currawong, <a href="Australian%20raven">Australian raven</a> ("Corvus coronoides"), <a href="common%20brushtail%20possum">common brushtail possum</a> ("Trichosurus vulpecula"), domestic cat, and snakes.

"<a href="Isospora%20anthochaerae">Isospora anthochaerae</a>" is an <a href="Apicomplexa">Apicomplexa</a>n parasite that has been isolated from the red wattlebird in Western Australia, from <a href="oocyte">oocyte</a>s collected from faecal samples. Species of <a href="bird%20louse">bird louse</a> that have been recorded on the red wattlebird include "<a href="Menacanthus%20eurysternus">Menacanthus eurysternus</a>" and members of the genera "<a href="Brueelia">Brueelia</a>", "<a href="Myrsidea">Myrsidea</a>" and "<a href="Philopterus">Philopterus</a>".

Red wattlebirds are adversely impacted by land and <a href="undergrowth">undergrowth</a> clearing, and have vanished from some habitats thus altered. Despite this, they are classified as Least Concern on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> as they occur over a wide range, have a large population, and the population decline is not rapid. Red wattlebirds are regularly killed by cats and dogs, as well as being hit by cars on roads. In 1924 in northern Victoria, the red wattlebird was described as very wary, on account of being highly regarded (and shot) for its meat. Indeed, it was shot widely for food or sport, or because it was held to be a pest of vineyards or orchards. On occasion, red wattlebirds have raided vineyards and orchards for grapes, stone fruit, figs, olives, <a href="loquat">loquat</a>s, apples, pears and berries, which they puncture and extract the juice or flesh from.

The red wattlebird has been kept as an aviary bird in Sydney. It is not difficult to look after but can be very aggressive to other cage birds. <a href="Grevillea%20%27Robyn%20Gordon%27">"Grevillea" 'Robyn Gordon'</a> is a useful companion shrub as it bears flowers all year round.

Albert Ketèlbey

Albert William Ketèlbey (; born Ketelbey; 9 August 1875 – 26 November 1959) was an English composer, conductor and pianist, best known for his short pieces of <a href="light%20music">light orchestral music</a>. He was born in <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> and moved to London in 1889 to study at <a href="Trinity%20Laban%20Conservatoire%20of%20Music%20and%20Dance">Trinity College of Music</a>. After a brilliant studentship he did not pursue the classical career predicted for him, becoming musical director of the <a href="Vaudeville%20Theatre">Vaudeville Theatre</a> before gaining fame as a composer of light music and as a conductor of his own works.

For many years Ketèlbey worked for a series of music publishers, including <a href="Chappell%20%26amp%3B%20Co">Chappell & Co</a> and the <a href="Columbia%20Graphophone%20Company">Columbia Graphophone Company</a>, making arrangements for smaller orchestras, a period in which he learned to write fluent and popular music. He also found great success writing music for <a href="silent%20film">silent film</a>s until the advent of <a href="sound%20film">talking films</a> in the late 1920s.

The composer's early works in conventional classical style were well received, but it was for his light orchestral pieces that he became best known. One of his earliest works in the genre, "<a href="In%20a%20Monastery%20Garden">In a Monastery Garden</a>" (1915), sold over a million copies and brought him to widespread notice; his later musical depictions of exotic scenes caught the public imagination and established his fortune. Such works as "<a href="In%20a%20Persian%20Market">In a Persian Market</a>" (1920), "<a href="In%20a%20Chinese%20Temple%20Garden">In a Chinese Temple Garden</a>" (1923), and "<a href="In%20the%20Mystic%20Land%20of%20Egypt">In the Mystic Land of Egypt</a>" (1931) became best-sellers in print and on records; by the late 1920s he was Britain's first millionaire composer. His celebrations of British scenes were equally popular: examples include "Cockney Suite" (1924) with its scenes of London life, and his ceremonial music for royal events. His works were frequently recorded during his heyday, and a substantial part of his output has been put on CD in more recent years.

Ketèlbey's popularity began to wane during the Second World War and his originality also declined; many of his post-war works were re-workings of older pieces and he increasingly found his music ignored by the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>. In 1949 he moved to the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a>, where he spent his retirement, and he died at home in obscurity. His work has been reappraised since his death; in a 2003 poll by the BBC radio programme "<a href="Your%20Hundred%20Best%20Tunes">Your Hundred Best Tunes</a>", "<a href="Bells%20Across%20the%20Meadows">Bells Across the Meadows</a>" was voted the 36th most popular tune of all time and the last night of the 2009 <a href="The%20Proms">Proms</a> season marked the fiftieth anniversary of Ketèlbey's death—the first time his music had been included in the festival's finale.

Albert William Ketèlbey was born on 9 August 1875 at 41 Alma Street in the <a href="Aston">Aston</a> area of <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, England. He was the second of five children of George Henry, a jewellery engraver, and his wife Sarah Ann, Aston. The <a href="grave%20accent">grave accent</a> was Albert's invention: the family name was spelled without it at the time of his birth and there had been several variants of the name in the previous generations. All the children were taught a musical instrument and Ketèlbey's brother, Harold, was later a violinist of note. Albert showed a natural talent for the piano and singing, and he subsequently became head chorister at <a href="St%20Silas%27%20Church%2C%20Lozells">St Silas' Church</a> in nearby <a href="Lozells">Lozells</a>.

At the age of eleven Ketèlbey joined the <a href="Birmingham%20and%20Midland%20Institute">Birmingham and Midland Institute</a> school of music (now the <a href="Birmingham%20Conservatoire">Birmingham Conservatoire</a>) where he was tutored by <a href="Alfred%20R.%20Gaul">Dr Alfred Gaul</a> in composition and <a href="Herbert%20Walter%20Wareing">Dr H. W. Wareing</a> in harmony. At the age of thirteen Ketèlbey composed his first serious piece of music, "Sonata for Pianoforte", which, for Tom McCanna, his biographer, "shows a precocious mastery of composition". Ketèlbey competed for a scholarship to <a href="Trinity%20Laban%20Conservatoire%20of%20Music%20and%20Dance">Trinity College of Music</a> in London, and received the highest marks of all entrants; the future composer <a href="Gustav%20Holst">Gustav Holst</a> came second. Ketèlbey entered the college in 1889, studying under G. E. Bambridge (piano), Dr G. Saunders (harmony) and <a href="Frederick%20Corder">Frederick Corder</a> (composition).

In 1892 Ketèlbey again won the annual scholarship competition and was appointed as the organist at St John's Church, <a href="Wimbledon%2C%20London">Wimbledon, London</a>. He held the post for the next five years, during which time he wrote several anthems and hymns, the latter of which included "Every Good Gift", "Behold! Upon the Mountains" and "Be Strong! All ye People". It was around this time he added the accent to his surname, with the aim of moving the stress onto the second syllable, rather than the first. In that year he appeared in a series of concerts in London and provincial cities. In March 1892 at the capital's <a href="Queen%27s%20Hall">Queen's Hall</a> he played <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Chopin">Frédéric Chopin</a>'s <a href="Scherzo%20No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B2%20%28Chopin%29">Scherzo No. 2 in B-flat minor</a>; the reviewer for "<a href="The%20Illustrated%20London%20News">The Illustrated London News</a>" thought the "brilliant" Ketèlbey played "most beautifully". He won several prizes at the college before being awarded his certificate in 1895. During this period, "The British Musician" reports, some critics found likenesses between Ketèlbey's music and that of <a href="Edward%20German">Edward German</a>.

Towards the end of his time at the college Ketèlbey wrote lighter, mostly <a href="mandolin">mandolin</a>-based, compositions. As he still aspired to be a serious composer, he adapted the pseudonym Raoul Clifford in an effort to distance himself from the genre. On leaving the college he became one of its examiners in harmony. He wrote piano pieces as part of his role, and used the pseudonym Anton Vodorinski for the work; he subsequently used the name for more serious works, which he published with French titles.

In 1896 Ketèlbey took up the post of conductor for a travelling <a href="light%20opera">light opera</a> company; his father, who wanted his son to be a composer of serious music, disapproved of what he saw as a lightweight role. After a two-year tour Ketèlbey was appointed as musical director of the <a href="Opera%20Comique">Opera Comique</a> Theatre—at age 22, the youngest theatrical conductor in London at the time. He moved into a house in Bruton Street, in London's <a href="Mayfair">Mayfair</a>, where he wrote the song "Blow! Blow! Thou Winter Wind", to words from Shakespeare's "<a href="As%20You%20Like%20It">As You Like It</a>". The Opera Comique staged a successful revival of the musical "<a href="Alice%20in%20Wonderland%20%28musical%29">Alice in Wonderland</a>" between December 1898 and March 1899, and according to his biographer John Sant, it is possible that Ketèlbey wrote some of the music. This was followed by the comic opera "A Good Time" from April, for which Ketèlbey wrote the music and songs. Following poor reviews, the short run of the piece ended in May and the Opera Comique closed because of the losses brought about by the production. There, Ketèlbey began a relationship with the actress and singer Charlotte "Lottie" Siegenberg. The couple married in 1906 but the relationship was childless.

Ketèlbey wrote music in the style of the <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a> works for a comic opera "The Wonder Worker", which was staged at the Grand Theatre, Fulham in 1900. The reviewer for the "<a href="London%20Evening%20Standard">London Evening Standard</a>" thought Ketèlbey's score was "attractive though conventional ... No originality is shown in conception or treatment, but the conception is appropriate, and the treatment effective." The same year Ketèlbey began undertaking transcription work at the music publisher A. Hammond & Co, making arrangements of music for smaller orchestras. In 1904 he also began to work for a second music publisher, <a href="Chappell%20%26amp%3B%20Co">Chappell & Co</a>, a third in 1907, the <a href="Columbia%20Graphophone%20Company">Columbia Graphophone Company</a>, and a fourth in 1910, when he worked for Elkin & Co. McCanna considers that "this hack-work may have been tedious, but the experience was invaluable in moulding the composer's fluent writing for both piano and orchestra". Throughout the time working for the companies he continued to compose and publish his own work, comprising organ music, songs, duets, piano pieces and anthems. He worked for Columbia for over twenty years and rose to the position of Musical Director and Adviser, working with leading musicians across a range of musical styles; Columbia released more than 600 recordings with Ketèlbey conducting.

In 1912 the composer and cellist <a href="Auguste%20van%20Biene">Auguste van Biene</a> offered a prize for a new work to complement his popular piece "The Broken Melody". Ketèlbey was the winner of the competition with a new composition, "The Phantom Melody", which became his first major success. In the following year he won two prizes totalling £200 in a competition held by "<a href="The%20Evening%20News%20%28London%20newspaper%29">The Evening News</a>": second place with a song for female voices, and first place with his entry for male voices. The latter song, "My Heart Still Clings to You", is described by Sant as "a typical tragical-love ballad of this time, and its almost Victorian sentimentality comes through in its words". In the early to mid-1910s Ketèlbey began to write music for <a href="silent%20films">silent films</a>—a new growth industry in Britain from 1910 onwards—and he had great success in the medium until the advent of <a href="sound%20film">talking films</a> in the late 1920s.

In 1914 Ketèlbey wrote the orchestral work "<a href="In%20a%20Monastery%20Garden">In a Monastery Garden</a>", which was published in the following year both as a piano piece and in full orchestral form. It was his first major success, his most famous piece, and became known all over the world; by 1920 over a million copies of the sheet music had been sold. There are two competing stories detailing the inspiration behind the piece: although Ketèlbey later said that he wrote the work for an old friend, he also stated that he composed it after visiting a monastery. The musicologist Peter Dempsey considers that "this piece ... remains to this day a world-renowned staple of the light-music repertoire, while McCanna opines that from the first bar, listeners "... might sooner expect such a device in the impassioned world of a <a href="Gustav%20Mahler">[Gustav] Mahler</a> symphony than in a genteel English salon piece". The success of "The Phantom Melody" and "In a Monastery Garden" led to Ketèlbey's engagement by <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Charlot">André Charlot</a> as the musical director for the 1916 revue "Samples!" at the <a href="Vaudeville%20Theatre">Vaudeville Theatre</a>. The appointment led to similar positions at other London theatres, including the <a href="Adelphi%20Theatre">Adelphi</a>, <a href="Garrick%20Theatre">Garrick</a>, <a href="Shaftesbury%20Theatre">Shaftesbury</a> and <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Drury Lane</a> theatres.

Because of the rise in Ketèlbey's popularity, and in sales of his sheet music, in 1918 he became a member of the <a href="Performing%20Rights%20Society">Performing Rights Society</a>. Except for a brief interval in 1926 when he resigned over a dispute about the allocation of funds to its members, he remained a lifelong member. In 1919 he composed the <a href="Romantic%20music">romantic</a> work "In the Moonlight", which his publisher considered to be "a work of striking beauty". In the following year he wrote "Wedgwood Blue"—a <a href="gavotte">gavotte</a>—and "In a Persian Market"; the latter became one of his more popular works. The musicologist <a href="Jonathan%20Bellman">Jonathan Bellman</a>, calling "In a Persian Market" "immortal", describes it as "an 'intermezzo scene' for band or small orchestra; reprehensibly demeaning or delightfully tacky". The work was not without its critics; the composer and conductor <a href="Nicolas%20Slonimsky">Nicolas Slonimsky</a> quotes the view of a Russian journal that "the suite ... had its 'immaculate conception' in imperialistic colonial England. The composer's intention is to convince the listener that all's well in the colonies where beautiful women and exotic fruits mature together, where beggars and rulers are friends, where there are no imperialists, no restive proletarians." In "The Musical Times", the pseudonymous reviewer "Ariel" described the work as "naive and inexpensive pseudo-orientalism", which led to heated correspondence in the journal over the following months between the composer and the critic.
In 1921 Ketèlbey moved from his home in <a href="St%20John%27s%20Wood">St John's Wood</a>, where he had been living for the previous seven years, to <a href="Frognal">Frognal</a>, an area of <a href="Hampstead">Hampstead</a>, north west London. He installed a <a href="English%20billiards">billiards</a> table in the basement, which became his favoured form of relaxation. He produced a series of orchestral pieces in the first half of the 1920s, including "<a href="Bells%20Across%20the%20Meadows">Bells Across the Meadows</a>" released in 1921, and "Suite Romantique" (1922), which the music critic Tim McDonald considers "impressive". In the following year Ketèlbey wrote "<a href="In%20a%20Chinese%20Temple%20Garden">In a Chinese Temple Garden</a>", followed in 1924 by "Sanctuary of the Heart" and "Cockney Suite". The last of these contained the finale "'Appy 'Ampstead", which the writers Lewis and Susan Foreman describe as "... a kaleidoscope of passing images, mouth organs, a cornet playing, ... a band, ... shouts of a showman ... with his rattle and a steam engine and roundabout".

In 1923 the composer <a href="Frederic%20Austin">Frederic Austin</a> wrote the opera "Polly", closely based on <a href="Polly%20%28opera%29">the 1729 work of the same name</a> by <a href="John%20Gay">John Gay</a> and <a href="Johann%20Christoph%20Pepusch">Johann Christoph Pepusch</a>; recordings of Austin's work were published by Columbia's main rival, the <a href="Gramophone%20Company">Gramophone Company</a>. At Columbia's request Ketèlbey produced his own version of Gay's original. Austin considered that it copied elements of his, and sued for <a href="copyright%20infringement">copyright infringement</a>. Acting as a court <a href="expert%20witness">expert witness</a>, the composer <a href="Frederick%20Bridge">Sir Frederick Bridge</a> thought that the case "... is an awful bore. ... These two good men are good musicians, and they have no business to be fighting over the game. It is not worth the trouble. ... It is rubbish. I am sick of "Polly"." After three weeks the case ended with the judge finding against Columbia.

Such was Ketèlbey's popularity that by 1924 his works could be heard several times a day in restaurants and cinemas, and in that year the <a href="J.%20Lyons%20and%20Co.">Lyons tea shops</a> spent £150,000 on playing his music in their outlets. He continued to build on his success in 1925 with "In a Lovers' Garden" and "In the Camp of the Ancient Britons"—inspired by a trip he took to <a href="Worlebury%20Camp">Worlebury Camp</a>, near <a href="Weston-super-Mare">Weston-super-Mare</a>. He undertook annual tours of Britain, conducting his music with municipal orchestras, and also worked with the <a href="BBC%20Wireless%20Orchestra">BBC Wireless Orchestra</a>. He was invited to conduct several international orchestras, and spent time in Belgium, Germany, France, Switzerland and particularly in the Netherlands, where he built a strong relationship with the <a href="Concertgebouw%20Orchestra">Concertgebouw</a> and Kursaal Grand Symphony orchestras. His music was popular on the continent and his obituarist in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" later reported that one Viennese critic considered that Ketèlbey's music was behind only that of <a href="Johann%20Strauss%20II">Johann Strauss</a> and <a href="Franz%20Leh%C3%A1r">Franz Lehár</a>. Continental audiences often called him "The English Strauss".

Ketèlbey was financially successful enough to leave Columbia Records in 1926 to spend more time composing, although he continued to conduct for them on an occasional basis, particularly between 1928 and 1930 when he conducted sixteen of his own works with the company, published as "Ketèlbey Conducting his Concert Orchestra". He spent his time undertaking annual conducting tours and composing, and in 1927 he published "<a href="By%20the%20Blue%20Hawaiian%20Waters">By the Blue Hawaiian Waters</a>" and the suite "In a Fairy Realm", while in the following year he wrote another suite, "Three Fanciful Etchings". His works continued to sell well, and in the October 1929 issue of the "Performing Right Gazette" his publisher described him as "Britain's greatest living composer"; when the advertisement was mentioned in "<a href="The%20Musical%20Times">The Musical Times</a>", the anonymous writer wrote "we sympathise with Mr Ketèlbey in being thus raised to a pinnacle which he himself, we are sure, would be very far from claiming." Sant writes that Ketèlbey subsequently became Britain's first millionaire composer. In February 1930 he began what became an annual series of concerts at the <a href="Kingsway%20Hall">Kingsway Hall</a>, conducting a new work, "<a href="The%20Clock%20and%20the%20Dresden%20Figures">The Clock and the Dresden Figures</a>". In a review of the 1933 concert, the critic S.R. Nelson wrote that "as a descriptive writer Ketèlbey really does take some beating. He has the happy knack of combining infinitely melodious themes and the cleverly diluted likeness of the authentic atmosphere."

The introduction of talking films in 1927 with "<a href="The%20Jazz%20Singer">The Jazz Singer</a>" and the subsequent growth of the medium had a serious impact on composers and music publishers involved in the film industry as it heralded a decline in the sales of sheet music. Although Ketèlbey's income from this source declined, the period was also marked by a rise in the popularity of the radio and gramophones and his new compositions were successful with audiences at home. By the early 1930s over 1,500 broadcasts of his work were made on <a href="BBC%20Radio">BBC Radio</a> in a year, and more than 700 on continental radio stations, including a weekly Sunday programme of his music, sponsored by <a href="Decca%20Records">Decca Records</a> on <a href="Radio%20Luxembourg">Radio Luxembourg</a>. For this programme he wrote the theme music, "Sunday Afternoon Reverie", with the melody based on the <a href="Chromatic%20scale">musical notes</a> D E C C A.

Ketèlbey wrote an <a href="intermezzo">intermezzo</a>—"A Birthday Greeting"—in 1932, on the sixth birthday of Princess Elizabeth (later <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a>). His connection to royalty continued in 1934, when his march "A State Procession" was played to accompany the arrival of <a href="George%20V">King George V</a> at a <a href="Royal%20Command%20Performance">Royal Command Performance</a>; the king requested that the march should be played again during the interval, and he and the queen stayed in the royal box to listen to the piece. In the following year Ketèlbey wrote the march "With Honour Crowned" for the King's <a href="silver%20jubilee">silver jubilee</a>; the work was played for the royal family at <a href="Windsor%20Castle">Windsor Castle</a> before Ketèlbey conducted its first public performance at Kingsway Hall. The work was played at that year's <a href="Trooping%20the%20Colour">Trooping the Colour</a> and at the Jubilee Thanksgiving Service at <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a>.

Ketèlbey continued to conduct on his annual tours during the Second World War, but these were on a smaller scale because of travel restrictions. He also continued with his annual concerts at Kingsway Hall, and introduced a new march, "Fighting for Freedom", which he had written in a supportive response to <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>'s "<a href="We%20shall%20fight%20on%20the%20beaches">We shall fight on the beaches</a>" speech. Apart from composing and conducting, he also acted as a <a href="Special%20Constabulary">Special Constable</a> during the war.

The <a href="Winter%20of%201946%E2%80%9347%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">winter of 1946–47</a> was harsh, and in February the sub-zero temperatures burst the water main outside Ketèlbey's Hampstead home. With his house partially flooded, he lost most of his correspondence, manuscripts and papers and he and his wife both contracted <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>. The couple were taken to the Regent's Park Nursing Home, where Lottie died two days later. He sold his house and moved temporarily to the Hendon Hall Hotel, where he had a nervous breakdown. He spent the remainder of the year staying in hotels in <a href="southern%20England">southern England</a>; in <a href="Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> he began a relationship with Mabel Maud Pritchett, a hotel manageress, and the couple married in October in the following year.

In 1949 Ketèlbey and his new wife moved to the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a>, and purchased Rookstone, Egypt Hill, in <a href="Cowes">Cowes</a>, where he partly retired, although he still composed occasionally. Tastes in popular music had changed during and after the war and his music declined in popularity; his income in 1940 had been £3,493, which dropped to £2,906 in 1950—a particularly steep drop when wartime inflation is considered. McCanna writes that apart from a commission for the National Brass Band competition in 1945, Ketèlbey produced nothing memorable after the war, and his biographer Keith Anderson considers that in the postwar period Ketèlbey's work "... lacked novelty. Of the handful of works published ... most were reworkings of old material, although the composer attempted to disguise the origins". The BBC also began to ignore his work. In their 1949 Festival of Light Music, none of his compositions were played, which he found distressing. In his letter to the <a href="Director-General%20of%20the%20BBC">Director-General of the BBC</a>, <a href="William%20Haley">Sir William Haley</a>, Ketèlbey said the exclusion was "a public insult". His music still found an audience: in 1952 and 1953 "With Honour Crowned" was again played as a slow march at the Trooping the Colour ceremony.

Ketèlbey died in his Cowes home of heart and renal failure on 26 November 1959. By the time of his death he had slipped into obscurity. Only a handful of mourners attended his funeral, which was held at <a href="Golders%20Green%20Crematorium">Golders Green Crematorium</a> in London.

Under his own name and at least six pseudonyms Ketèlbey composed several hundred works, about 150 of them for the orchestra. In the "Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians", Phillip Scowcroft writes, "His gifts for melody and sensitive, colourful scoring ensured continuing popularity with light orchestras and bands until after 1945. The most popular of his hundreds of pieces emphasize emotionalism and sometimes exaggerated effects at the expense of structure and harmonic subtlety."

Ketèlbey's early compositions are classical and orthodox in form, reflecting the training at Trinity College. The first substantial work was a piano sonata (1888); it was followed by a <a href="Capriccio%20%28music%29">Caprice</a> for piano and orchestra (1892), a <a href="Concertino%20%28composition%29">Concertstück</a> for piano and orchestra (circa 1893) and a piano concerto in G minor (1895). Ketèlbey's piano writing was notable for its brilliance, and the composer's own performance of the solo part of the Concertstück brought out that quality. As a student, Ketèlbey composed a cadenza for the first movement of Beethoven's <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B1%20%28Beethoven%29">First Piano Concerto</a>, judged "clever and effective" in performance in 1890.

For the chamber repertoire, Ketèlbey composed a string quartet (c. 1896) and a quintet for piano and wind (1896) which won the Costa Prize and the College Gold Medal. His 1894 Romance for violin and piano was praised as "a charming, musicianly work". His other early works include choral pieces, including the <a href="anthem">anthem</a>s "Every good Gift"; "Behold upon the mountains", and "Be strong, all ye people" (all 1896). After these works he moved professionally into conducting light opera, and serious music became the exception rather than the rule in his compositions.

Ketèlbey's concert music was less well known in England than in continental Europe, where he conducted many programmes of his own works for the Concertgebouw Orchestra and others. The composer's more avowedly serious music was less widely esteemed by his compatriots. In a 1928 profile the magazine "The British Musician" commented, "There is no need to explain here why his serious music, whether written thirty years ago or as recently as 1927 ... has not won the popularity of, say, Edward German's dances: it is pleasant music, delightfully scored; but it is not so fascinating as that from which it derives—the music of the Viennese writers of dance music, of Délibes and Gounod and the like." The reviewer added, "Albert Ketèlbey's works of the "Monastery Garden" type are by far the best that anyone in this country has written, and they represent the end to which he was born."

Ketèlbey, a capable player of the cello, clarinet, oboe, and horn, was a skilled orchestrator. He generally followed the normal style for light music of his day: picturesque and romantic, with colourful orchestral effects. Reviewing a collection of Ketèlbey's music, the authors of "<a href="The%20Penguin%20Guide%20to%20Recorded%20Classical%20Music">The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music</a>" commented in 2008, "when vulgarity is called for it is not shirked—only it's a stylish kind of vulgarity!" Many of Ketèlbey's pieces are <a href="programme%20music">programmatic</a>, typically lasting between four and six minutes. His penchant for arranging his works for various combinations of instruments makes them harder to categorise than the works of many other composers. His first two pieces to make a mark with a wide public were "The Phantom Melody" (1911) and "In a Monastery Garden" (1915), both best known in their orchestral versions, but originally written for cello and piano and for solo piano respectively. For the familiar orchestral version of the second of these pieces the composer published a synopsis:

Ketèlbey followed the same basic formula for many of his most popular later works. For "In a Persian Market" his synopsis notes "the camel drivers approaching, the cries of beggars, entry of beautiful princess (represented by a languorous theme given at first to clarinet and cello and then full orchestra) ... she watches the jugglers and snake-charmers ... the Caliph passes by, interrupting the entertainment ... all depart, their themes heard faintly in the distance, and the marketplace becomes deserted." Ketèlbey establishes the eastern setting in the opening section, employing the distinctive melodic intervals, A–B–E. The orchestral players are instructed to sing at two points in the score, a descending motif representing beggars crying for <a href="baksheesh">baksheesh</a>. Although one contemporary critic belittled the music as "pseudo-orientalism", McCanna comments that "The princess portrayed by the big romantic theme is a cousin of the princesses in <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Stravinsky</a>'s "<a href="The%20Firebird">Firebird</a>"".

Ketèlbey sought to repeat the exoticism of "In a Persian Market" in several later pieces. Among them is "<a href="In%20a%20Chinese%20Temple%20Garden">In a Chinese Temple Garden</a>" (1923), described as an "oriental phantasy", with episodes depicting a priestly incantation, two lovers, a wedding procession, a street brawl and the restoration of calm by the beating of the temple gong. Another example is "<a href="In%20the%20Mystic%20Land%20of%20Egypt">In the Mystic Land of Egypt</a>" (1931), which, like its Persian predecessor, opens with a vigorous march theme followed by a broad romantic melody. Again, the composer employs unconventional musical devices for colour—in this case a chromatic scale, descending at each appearance until the closing bars, where it is inverted. In 1958, the critic Ronald Ever wrote that Ketèlbey was noted for his use of "every exotic noisemaker known to man—chimes, orchestra bells, gongs (all sizes and nationalities), cymbals, woodblocks, xylophone, drums of every variety". Ever commented that Ketèlbey's exoticism had left an immovable impression of eastern music on western ears, to which "Oriental music is Ketèlbey music: the clashing cymbals; the little pinging bells; the minor modes; the amazingly graphic mincing step created by rapidly reiterated notes; the coy taps on the woodblock."

Among Ketèlbey's light orchestral works with a wholly British flavour is "Bells Across the Meadows" (1921), redolent, in the words of McDonald, of "rose-entwined thatched cottages standing amidst gardens full of hollyhocks with a gentle brook bubbling on its rustic way and cows grazing peacefully in the pastures beyond". Urban life was evoked in the five-movement "Cockney Suite" (1924), described by "The Times" as "character pieces complete with leering saxophone, cheeky mouth-organ, and some infernally catchy tunes". Ketèlbey depicts successively a royal procession from <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> to the <a href="Palace%20of%20Westminster">Houses of Parliament</a>; an <a href="East%20End">East End</a> pub, with a main theme based on the <a href="Cockney">Cockney</a> ditty "'Arf a pint of mild and bitter"; a waltz at a "<a href="dance%20hall">palais de danse</a>"; a sombre glimpse of the <a href="The%20Cenotaph%2C%20Whitehall">Cenotaph</a> in <a href="Whitehall">Whitehall</a>; and in the finale, "'Appy 'Ampstead", a picture of the <a href="August%20Bank%20Holiday">August Bank Holiday</a> fair on <a href="Hampstead%20Heath">Hampstead Heath</a>.

Much of the music Ketèlbey wrote as accompaniment to silent films between 1915 and 1929, though lucrative at the time, has proved ephemeral, although he reused and rearranged some of it in solo pieces for amateur pianists. With the requirements of cinemas of all sizes in mind, his film music was published in the "Bosworth Loose Leaf Film Play Music Series" in versions for solo piano or for small orchestras. The titles offered included "Dramatic Agitato", "Amaryllis" (described by the composer as "suitable for use in dainty, fickle scenes"), "Mystery" ("greatly in favour for uncanny and weird picturizations"), "Agitato Furioso" ("famous for its excellence in playing to riots, storms, wars, etc.") and "Bacchanale de Montmartre" (for "cabaret, orgy and riotous continental scenes").

In addition to arrangements for solo instruments of his popular orchestral works, Ketèlbey wrote a range of music for organ and for piano. Some of the more serious of these pieces were published under his "Vodorinski" pen name. Among the organ works are "Pastorale" and "Rêverie dramatique", both dating from about 1911. The piano works include the early classical pieces such as the 1888 Sonata, and shorter items in a more popular style, such as "Rêverie" (1894) and "Les pèlerins" (1925), by way of "A Romantic Melody" (1898), "Pensées joyeuses" (1888), "In the Woodlands" (1921), "A Song of Summer" (1922), and "Légende triste" (1923). The musical influences on his piano works were on the whole conservative: for the early works McCanna mentions Haydn and Mendelssohn in this context. Much of the piano music published in the years after the First World War was aimed at a domestic audience; it requires only a modest technical proficiency to play and is simple in structure with deft harmonies. The most commercially successful of the Vodorinski works was the Prelude in C minor (1907). McCanna comments that not only the title but the material is reminiscent of Rachmaninoff: "the music turns out to copy some of the more illustrious composer's features, notably the final fortissimo statement of the melody in the bass". Ketèlbey followed Chopin's model in several waltzes in the key of A major, including "La grâcieuse" (1907) and two different pieces under the title Valse brillante (1905 and 1911).

Throughout his career Ketèlbey composed songs, providing the words for most of those written after 1913. His first, unpublished, song, "Be Still, Sad Heart" dates from 1892, and during the rest of the 1890s he wrote songs for children as well as sentimental ballads like "Believe Me True" (1897) for their seniors. Many had words by Florence Hoare, whose other lyrics included English words for songs by Tchaikovsky, Gounod and Brahms. Ketèlbey's popular ballads included "<a href="The%20Heart%27s%20Awakening">The Heart's Awakening</a>" (1907), "My Heart-a-dream" (1909), "I Loved You More Than I Knew" (1912), "My Heart Still Clings to You" (1913), "Will You Forgive?" (1924), and "A Birthday Song" (1933). He wrote patriotic songs for use in three wars: "There's Something in the English After all" (1899, during the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Boer War</a>), "The Trumpet Voice of Motherland is Calling" (1914, for the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>) and "Fighting for Freedom" (1941, during the Second World War). His sole Shakespeare setting, "Blow! Blow! Thou Winter Wind" (1898, revised 1951), was written as incidental music for a production of "As You Like It".

The obituarist for "The Musical Times" wrote that "Ketèlbey's especial fame ... consisted in his phenomenal success as a composer of light music. His remarkable gift for alluring tunes, rich in homely sentiment, was reflected in the immense popularity of [his] pieces". McCanna opines that Ketèlbey's popularity

lay in its memorable expressive melodies combined with its ability to set the scene by enhanced use of different kinds of colour: local colour in the choice of characteristic settings, often with explicit narrative captions printed above the music; musical colour in the form of exotic scales and harmonies; orchestral colour in the novel use of singing by the players and of sound effects executed by the drummer.

During his tenure at Columbia, Ketèlbey promoted the works of several composers, including <a href="Haydn%20Wood">Haydn Wood</a>, <a href="Charles%20Ancliffe">Charles Ancliffe</a>, <a href="Ivor%20Novello">Ivor Novello</a>, <a href="James%20W.%20Tate">James W. Tate</a> and <a href="Kenneth%20J.%20Alford">Kenneth J. Alford</a>, helping to increase the popularity of British light music. <a href="Ronnie%20Ronalde">Ronnie Ronalde</a> made "In a Monastery Garden" his signature tune from 1958, while <a href="Serge%20Gainsbourg">Serge Gainsbourg</a> used the theme of "In a Persian Market" for his 1977 song "My Lady Héroïne".

Dempsey, writing in 2001, considered that Ketèlbey's "late-Romantic tone miniatures ... are deserving of reappraisal". The composer's reputation has improved over time, and the cultural historian Andrew Blake identifies a "form of 'cult following'" for him. In the 21st century, Ketèlbey's music is still frequently heard on radio and in a 2003 poll by the BBC radio programme "<a href="Your%20Hundred%20Best%20Tunes">Your Hundred Best Tunes</a>", "Bells across the Meadows" was voted thirty-sixth most popular tune of all time. The last night of the corporation's 2009 <a href="The%20Proms">Proms</a> season included "In a Monastery Garden" to mark the fiftieth anniversary of Ketèlbey's death; it was the first time the tune had been included in the festival's finale. <a href="Tim%20Page%20%28music%20critic%29">Tim Page</a>, the music critic for "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>", considers that Ketèlbey's work expresses an "ornate, perfumed, genteel Orientalism [which] found expression in miniatures"; he adds that "all of Ketèlbey's music is pretty weird—deeply derivative yet unmistakably personal, tidy in form yet grandiose in execution, amiable and often touching despite its unashamed mawkishness."

Tony Hawk's Underground

Tony Hawk's Underground is a <a href="skateboarding">skateboarding</a> video game published by <a href="Activision">Activision</a> in 2003, the fifth entry in the "<a href="Tony%20Hawk%27s%20%28series%29">Tony Hawk's</a>" series. <a href="Neversoft">Neversoft</a> developed the <a href="GameCube">GameCube</a>, <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a>, <a href="Xbox%20%28console%29">Xbox</a> versions, <a href="Beenox">Beenox</a> developed the <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> version, which was released in Australia and New Zealand as a budget release in 2004, while the <a href="Game%20Boy%20Advance">Game Boy Advance</a> adaptation was developed by <a href="Vicarious%20Visions">Vicarious Visions</a> and a <a href="Mobile%20game">mobile</a> version by <a href="Jamdat">Jamdat</a>.

"Underground" is built upon the skateboarding formula of previous "Tony Hawk's" games: the player explores <a href="level%20%28video%20gaming%29">levels</a> and completes goals while performing <a href="skateboarding%20trick">tricks</a>. The game features a new focus on customization; the player, instead of selecting a professional skater, creates a custom character. "Underground" adds the ability for players to dismount their boards and explore on foot. The plot follows the <a href="player%20character">player character</a> and their friend Eric Sparrow as the two become professionals and grow apart.

The game was developed with a theme of individuality, which was manifested in the extensive customization options, the presence of a narrative, and the product's characterization as an adventure game. Real-world professional skateboarders contributed their experiences to the plot. Upon release, the game was a major critical and commercial success, with reviewers praising its wide appeal, soundtrack, customization, multiplayer, and plot. The graphics and the controls for driving vehicles and walking were less well received. "Underground"s PlayStation 2 version had sold 2.11 million copies in the United States by December 2007. A sequel, "<a href="Tony%20Hawk%27s%20Underground%202">Underground 2</a>", was released in 2004.

Like its predecessors in the "<a href="Tony%20Hawk%27s%20%28series%29">Tony Hawk's</a>" series, "Underground" is centered on <a href="skateboarding">skateboarding</a> in a series of <a href="level%20%28video%20gaming%29">levels</a>. The player performs <a href="skateboarding%20trick">tricks</a> via combinations of <a href="analog%20stick">analog stick</a> and <a href="Push-button">button</a> inputs. For example, the player initiates an <a href="ollie%20%28skateboarding%29">ollie</a> (a jump trick) by holding and releasing the jump button. During an ollie, the player may change the position of the analog stick and press one of two buttons to perform either a <a href="flip%20trick">flip trick</a> (such as an <a href="Impossible%20%28skateboarding%20trick%29">impossible</a> or <a href="kickflip">kickflip</a>) or a <a href="grabs%20%28skateboarding%29">grab trick</a> (such as a <a href="benihana%20%28skateboarding%29">benihana</a> or <a href="nosegrab">nosegrab</a>). The player can <a href="grind%20%28skateboarding%29">grind</a> on certain edges and rails; different tricks may be performed during a grind based on the position of the analog stick. On <a href="quarter%20pipe">quarter pipe</a>s, the player may execute <a href="lip%20trick">lip trick</a>s. While skating on flat surfaces, the player may <a href="Manual%20%28skateboard%20trick%29">manual</a> in multiple ways via button combinations. Miscellaneous tricks include <a href="Duane%20Peters">acid drops</a> and <a href="wall%20jump">wall-rides</a>.

While a grind, lip, or manual trick is underway, a balance meter appears: unless the player prevents this meter from falling to the left or right, the character will <a href="bailing%20%28boardsports%29">bail</a> and need a few seconds to recover. Bailing can also be caused by falling without one's board facing downward. Completing tricks in succession without bailing is called a combo. Comboing raises the player's <a href="score%20%28game%29">score</a> and fills up the Special Meter; when it is full, the player is granted access to more elaborate tricks worth more points, such as the <a href="Aerial%20%28skateboarding%29">McTwist</a> and <a href="flip%20trick">540 Flip</a>. "Underground" introduces the ability to dismount one's skateboard, which allows the player to explore levels more carefully and reach new areas. Each level features at least one vehicle, usually a car, that the player can drive.

The levels are based on regions of the United States and other countries. In each level, certain tasks that advance the game's narrative must be completed before the player can move on. These tasks include <a href="score%20attack">score attack</a>s, races, item collection, and reaching one of many gaps found in a level. Each level houses one professional skateboarder, who provides a <a href="quest%20%28video%20gaming%29">sidequest</a> that unlocks a trick for the Special Meter. On account of the levels' large sizes and the integration of goals into the story, "Underground" has been described as an <a href="adventure%20game">adventure game</a>. Characters can level up their stats—which include jump height and speed—by completing optional goals in a level; this adds an element of <a href="role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing</a> gameplay. Other gameplay modes include <a href="multiplayer%20video%20game">multiplayer</a> minigames—one, a combat mode called "Firefight", can be played online in the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> version of the game—and a "free skate" mode that lets the player explore levels with no goals or story.

"Underground" features extensive customization. The player creates a custom character for the story mode, and may not play as a pre-made professional skater outside a few contexts: a special scene late in the game, minigames, and the free skate mode. A level editor allows the player to create <a href="skate%20park">skate park</a>s with a large array of objects, ranging from traditional skate park elements like <a href="halfpipe">halfpipe</a>s, ramps, <a href="funbox">funbox</a>es, and <a href="grind%20rail">grind rail</a>s to more outlandish pieces like buildings and sections of elevated freeways. The player can change their park's time of day and environmental theme. Tricks, skateboards, and level goals may be customized as well.

While the console versions of the game are fully <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">three-dimensional</a>, the <a href="Game%20Boy%20Advance">Game Boy Advance</a> version is rendered in an <a href="isometric%20graphics%20in%20video%20games%20and%20pixel%20art">isometric</a> style that incorporates both <a href="2D%20computer%20graphics">2D</a> sprites and 3D models. This version is a more traditional "Tony Hawk's" game, with little attention given to story or customization. The <a href="Mobile%20game">mobile</a> version is similarly restricted.

<a href="Player%20character">The protagonist</a> and their friend, Eric Sparrow, live in suburban <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> and dream of becoming famous skateboarders. The protagonist manages to impress professional skater <a href="Chad%20Muska">Chad Muska</a>, visiting town for a demo, who gives them a new skateboard and informs them that a good way to start a skating career is to gain a sponsorship from a local skate shop. The protagonist seeks out <a href="Stacy%20Peralta">Stacy Peralta</a>, who agrees until he sees something to set them apart from the other local skaters, so the protagonist travels to <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> with Eric, who is on the run from drug dealers after setting their car on fire for stealing from the skate shop.

There, the pair shoot a skating video that impresses Stacy, who loans them a van and suggests they enter the Tampa AM, an amateur division skate contest held annually at the Skate Park of Tampa in <a href="Tampa%2C%20Florida">Tampa, Florida</a>. Upon arrival, Eric is arrested for insulting a police officer, and the protagonist does favors for the local police department to secure his <a href="bail">bail</a>. However, when they arrive for the contest, it is revealed that Eric had only completed his own application form and not the protagonist's, forcing a dejected protagonist to try and impress competitors in the pro contest in order to gain admission. After impressing <a href="Tony%20Hawk">Tony Hawk</a>, the protagonist wins the Best Trick event at Tampa AM and is offered deals by major skateboard sponsors, much to Eric's dismay. The protagonist then heads to <a href="San%20Diego%2C%20California">San Diego, California</a> to meet Todd, the manager of the team, and completes several photo shoots for a magazine. Following a wild celebration party, it is revealed that Eric has been picked up by the same sponsor.

The team then flies out to <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> to film a video, with the protagonist aiming for local spots that skaters have not filmed at before. Finding a tall hotel, the protagonist climbs to the roof and recruits Eric to film a trick video atop it. The police arrive to arrest them for trespassing, but the protagonist uses the opportunity to perform a <a href="McTwist">McTwist</a> over the helicopter and onto the awning of an adjacent hotel, allowing them and an awestruck Eric to evade the police. The team then travels to <a href="Vancouver%2C%20British%20Columbia">Vancouver, British Columbia</a>. After doing errands for locals and finishing their part of the team video, the protagonist attends the video premiere at the <a href="Slam%20City%20Jam">Slam City Jam</a>. However, Eric steals the idea and edits the protagonist's part out of the video, allowing only Eric to become a professional. After angrily confronting Eric, the protagonist enters Eric's pro contest and wins, becoming a pro as well.

After designing their own pro skateboard, the protagonist and Eric embark on a team trip to <a href="Moscow%2C%20Russia">Moscow, Russia</a>, where they reconcile. However, Eric gets drunk and <a href="Joyride%20%28crime%29">joyrides</a> in a Russian military tank. The protagonist hops in and attempts to stop the tank, but being unfamiliar with the controls, fails to stop it from crashing. Eric jumps out and runs away, leaving the protagonist, trapped inside, to be arrested by the Russian military. Eric then lies and claims the protagonist stole the tank, stating that he in fact tried to stop them. Unwilling to pay the $700,000 worth of damages, Todd kicks the protagonist off the team, much to Eric's delight. The <a href="Embassy%20of%20the%20United%20States%20in%20Moscow">American Embassy</a> bails out the protagonist, leaving them to do favors for locals in order to return home to New Jersey.

Eric, who now owns his own skate company, reveals that he had been planning to betray the protagonist after having long abandoning the idea of "soul skating" (skating for enjoyment rather than riches); after unsuccessfully trying to exempt them from the Tampa AM, Eric stole the helicopter footage in jealousy before finally getting the protagonist kicked off the skate team by lying back in Moscow. Determined to fight back, the protagonist teams up with Peralta and several professionals to create a soul skating video, creating a new trick in the process. Due to the success of the video, Eric challenges the protagonist to one last skate-off, with the unedited helicopter tape at stake. The protagonist wins by avoiding Eric's attempts to cheat and walks away with the tape while Eric breaks down in anger.

If the story has been completed more than once, an <a href="alternate%20ending">alternate ending</a> occurs, where the protagonist knocks Eric unconscious, taking the tape back instead of holding the skate-off.

The game features many real world professional skateboarders including: <a href="Tony%20Hawk">Tony Hawk</a>, <a href="Chad%20Muska">Chad Muska</a>, and <a href="Stacy%20Peralta">Stacy Peralta</a>. "Underground" also features cameo appearances by <a href="Iron%20Man">Iron Man</a>, a parody of <a href="C.H.U.D.">C.H.U.D.</a> called T.H.U.D., and <a href="Kiss%20%28band%29">Kiss</a> bassist <a href="Gene%20Simmons">Gene Simmons</a>.

The <a href="GameCube">GameCube</a>, PlayStation 2, and <a href="Xbox%20%28console%29">Xbox</a> versions of "Underground" were developed by <a href="Neversoft">Neversoft</a>, while the Game Boy Advance version was developed by <a href="Vicarious%20Visions">Vicarious Visions</a> the mobile version by <a href="Jamdat">Jamdat</a>, and the <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a> version created by <a href="Beenox">Beenox</a>. <a href="Activision">Activision</a>, which had acquired Neversoft in 1999, published all versions of the game.

"Underground" was created with a theme of individuality: it stars an amateur skater in a true story mode, whereas each previous "Tony Hawk's" game had starred professional skaters and had lacked a plot. One reason for only allowing the player to use a custom character was that certain criminal acts completed in the plot would not reflect well on real-world skaters. Previous games in the series had included character-creation features as well, but Neversoft expanded customization in "Underground" by implementing face-scanning for the PlayStation 2 version: if the player emailed a photograph of their face to "faces@thugonline.com", the company would digitize it for use in the game. Regarding the customization options, especially the park editor, producer Stacey Drellishak stated that Neversoft was "trying to create the most customizable game ever". The developers used storytelling and exploration to distance their product from the plotless, task-based format of previous "Tony Hawk's" games, which led Neversoft president Joel Jewett to describe "Underground" as an adventure game.

Levels in the console versions of "Underground" were significantly larger than those of earlier "Tony Hawk's" games. Neversoft expanded each level until it ceased to run correctly, then shrunk it slightly. Most of the levels were modelled closely after real-world locations; the designers traveled to locales representative of each city in the game and took photographs and videos as reference. The New Jersey level was a replication of a neighborhood where team artist Henry Ji had grown up as a young skater. Neversoft wanted the player to become familiar with the basic game mechanics quickly and to notice "Underground"s differences from previous "Tony Hawk's" titles immediately. To accomplish this, they introduced the ability to travel on foot, and the ability to climb along ledges in the first few missions of the game. While Neversoft wanted to keep "Underground" realistic and relatable for the most part, they added driving side-missions as an enjoyable diversion and to push the boundaries of freedom in skateboarding games. However, these missions were intended not to take away from the main experience of skateboarding.

"<a href="Tony%20Hawk%27s%20Pro%20Skater%204">Pro Skater 4</a>", "Underground"s predecessor in the "Tony Hawk's" series, had received criticism for its difficulty: Neversoft had not realized that each game in the series was drawing new fans who were unaccustomed to the demanding tasks. As a result, Neversoft added four difficulty settings to "Underground"s story mode, ranging from "Too Easy" to "Sick". Neversoft wanted players to develop skills for higher difficulty settings on Too Easy while still progressing through the story. The company had included extremely difficult missions in each previous "Tony Hawk's" game; the methods used to create these missions were the inspiration for "Underground"s Sick mode. Development of the basic gameplay mechanics and structure began quickly but by the end of August 2003, only two months before the game's American release, work was still in progress.

While the game's cutscenes are animated with 3D graphics, the team recorded live-action videos to introduce the real-world skateboarding teams, so that players could better understand each team before selecting one to join. Neversoft interviewed professional skaters about their experiences of becoming known in the skateboarding world, then compiled elements of these stories into the game's script. Every skater who appears in the plot helped to craft their own scenes and voiced their own character.

The game was promoted with a playable demo at <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>'s "GameRiot" event held at <a href="Lollapalooza">Lollapalooza</a> in July 2003. Activision stirred up enthusiasm for "Underground" with the "Tony Hawk's Face Off Mobile Tour", a series of promotional events across 29 cities in October 2003. Attendees could play the game early and compete in it for tickets to <a href="Tony%20Hawk%23Other%20ventures">Boom Boom Huck Jam</a> 2003, which <a href="Tony%20Hawk">Tony Hawk</a> himself attended. Activision, which sponsored the October 2003 <a href="Gravity%20Games">Gravity Games</a> extreme sports competition, promoted the game at the event and used its rendering engine to model tricks performed by the real-world skaters. The console and Game Boy Advance versions were released on October 28 in the United States, November 14 in Europe, and May 2004 in Japan. The mobile version was released worldwide in January 2004.

"Tony Hawk's Underground" received "generally positive" reviews, according to <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregator</a> <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>. GameZone's Michael Knutson stated that "Underground" is "one of the best skating games around" and that players of every skill level would enjoy it. <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>'s Tom Bramwell concurred: "as a 'pick-up-and-play' sort of game, "THUG" is endlessly rewarding once you get your head round the basics, and it's the best entry point for the series to date."

The story was well received. Joe Rybicki of "<a href="Official%20U.S.%20PlayStation%20Magazine">Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine</a>" celebrated that "for the first time I can remember, an extreme-sports game actually has a real story [with] honest-to-goodness characters". <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Douglas Perry called it "a kick, albeit relatively lightweight in nature". He especially praised the pervasive sense of humor in the narrative and in the portrayal of real-world skaters. Knutson called the story "unique" and stated, "I really like that Neversoft had the guts to try something this radical and ditch the formula that they know works so well." Ben Silverman of <a href="Game%20Revolution">Game Revolution</a> described the game's plot as a "silly" cross between those of the 1980s films "<a href="North%20Shore%20%28film%29">North Shore</a>" and "<a href="Gleaming%20the%20Cube">Gleaming the Cube</a>", but he praised it for giving context to the level goals and keeping distance between the skill unlocks. Bramwell called it "hackneyed". Rybicki found that the plot hurt the game's <a href="replay%20value">replay value</a> and caused missions to be overly simplistic. By contrast, "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>"s Justin Leeper thought that "it serves to make some of the less-entertaining goals tolerable, because there’s a reason for doing them."

The game's aesthetics were generally well received. Bramwell called the graphics "unchanged and increasingly antiquated" and criticized the presence of "sharp, angular character models, eerily unrealistic lighting and odd little moments when the player is trying to turn round and ends up banging into a curb". Knutson, meanwhile, was positive regarding the graphics, art, and animation: he called them "nearly flawless" and praised the realism they brought to the inherently fantastical skateboarding genre. Williams said that ""THUG"s cityscapes are incredibly well designed" and singled out the GameCube version of "Underground" as exceptionally well rendered. Rybicki called the levels "big and beautiful". Knutson commended the soundtrack's large size and the sound effects' realism. Perry appreciated the "hilariously hurtful" injury sounds and the extensive song list. By contrast, IGN's Craig Harris praised the graphics of the Game Boy Advance version but was more mixed on the soundtrack.

The alternate gameplay modes were received very well. Knutson lauded the game's high degree of customization; he summarized that "everything is expounded a hundred fold: from create-a-skater to create-a-park mode, it is simply amazing". He singled out the level editor as one of the deepest he had ever seen. <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>'s Bryn Williams identified the level editor as an "extremely well-designed" feature that contributed to the overall "brilliance" of the full product. Leeper said that each customization mode is "intuitive and user-friendly", and both he and Rybicki especially enjoyed the trick-creation feature. Reviewers for "<a href="Famitsu">Famitsu</a>" magazine praised the story mode, whose <a href="open%20world">open world</a> format they compared to the <a href="Grand%20Theft%20Auto">"Grand Theft Auto" series</a>. Knutson and Perry enjoyed the multiplayer, particularly the online Firefight mode. Williams thought similarly and stated that "the most notable disappointment" of the game was the lack of online play for non-PlayStation 2 owners. Harris found the board customization of the Game Boy Advance version to be poorly implemented, though in-depth. Despite his praise for the customization modes, Leeper admitted that his greatest enjoyment still came from "seeking out great lines and beating my scores".

The walking and driving controls were criticized. Bramwell claimed that these modes felt "like they've been attached with an old stick of glue that's about as adhesive as baby oil". Knutson agreed, though he praised the novelty of these diversions. He stated that "the Tony Hawk series has always had exceptional controls" and that "Underground", overall, was no exception. Perry felt that the feature increased levels' replay value. Similarly, "Famitsu" reviewers noted that, although the game's fast pace makes it extremely challenging at times, the high difficulty provides a sense of accomplishment when jumps and tricks are performed correctly. Williams found the GameCube version's controls mediocre, albeit manageable. Damon Brown from <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> stated that the mobile version's restrictive controls—many tricks require three button inputs—were that version's only caveat.

"Underground" won Best Sports Game at the 2003 <a href="Game%20Critics%20Awards">Game Critics Awards</a> hosted by <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> (E3). The <a href="2004%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">2004 MTV Video Music Awards</a> introduced a new category, Best Video Game Soundtrack, which "Underground" won. In Europe the week after the game's release, the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube versions were respectively the fifth, sixth, and eighth-best selling games for those consoles. It would remain uninterrupted in the top twenty of every week until January 24, 2004, for the Xbox and GameCube and February 21 for the PlayStation 2, inclusive. As of December 2007, the PlayStation 2 edition of the game had sold 2.11 million copies in the United States. The GameCube version made Nintendo's <a href="Nintendo%20Selects">Player's Choice</a> list by selling 250,000 copies in the United States. Its PlayStation 2 version also received a "Platinum" sales award from the <a href="Entertainment%20and%20Leisure%20Software%20Publishers%20Association">Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association</a> (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

Neversoft and Activision released a sequel, "Underground 2", on October 4, 2004, for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox, Game Boy Advance, and <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a> consoles. The plot continues that of "Underground" and focuses on the player character and their team sabotaging an opposing team. The gameplay, structure, and level design are very similar to those of "Underground". However, "Underground 2" features new tricks and gameplay mechanics, like the <a href="Natas%20Kaupas">Natas spin</a>, the ability to plant customized stickers in levels with the "sticker slap", a slow-motion "Focus" mode, and the ability to earn points by having a tantrum after falling. The plot is set in new locations, including <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, and <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>.

Panic of 1907

The Panic of 1907 – also known as the 1907 Bankers' Panic or Knickerbocker Crisis – was a United States <a href="financial%20crisis">financial crisis</a> that took place over a three-week period starting in mid-October, when the <a href="New%20York%20Stock%20Exchange">New York Stock Exchange</a> fell almost 50% from its peak the previous year. Panic occurred, as this was during a time of economic <a href="recession">recession</a>, and there were numerous <a href="bank%20run">runs on banks</a> and <a href="Trust%20company">trust companies</a>. The 1907 panic eventually spread throughout the nation when many state and local banks and businesses entered <a href="bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a>. Primary causes of the run included a retraction of <a href="market%20liquidity">market liquidity</a> by a number of New York City banks and a loss of confidence among <a href="depositor">depositor</a>s, exacerbated by unregulated <a href="side%20bet">side bet</a>s at <a href="Bucket%20shop%20%28stock%20market%29">bucket shops</a>.
The panic was triggered by the failed attempt in October 1907 to <a href="Cornering%20the%20market">corner the market</a> on <a href="stock">stock</a> of the <a href="United%20Copper">United Copper Company</a>. When this bid failed, banks that had lent money to the cornering scheme suffered runs that later spread to affiliated banks and trusts, leading a week later to the downfall of the <a href="Knickerbocker%20Trust%20Company">Knickerbocker Trust Company</a>—New York City's third-largest trust. The collapse of the Knickerbocker spread fear throughout the city's trusts as <a href="regional%20bank">regional bank</a>s withdrew <a href="Bank%20reserves">reserves</a> from New York City banks. Panic extended across the nation as vast numbers of people withdrew deposits from their regional banks.

The panic might have deepened if not for the intervention of financier <a href="J.%20P.%20Morgan">J. P. Morgan</a>, who pledged large sums of his own money, and convinced other New York bankers to do the same, to shore up the <a href="Banking%20in%20the%20United%20States">banking system</a>. This highlighted the impotence of the nation's <a href="Independent%20Treasury">Independent Treasury</a> system, which managed the nation's <a href="money%20supply">money supply</a>, yet was unable to inject liquidity back into the market. By November, the <a href="financial%20contagion">financial contagion</a> had largely ended, only to be replaced by a further crisis. This was due to the heavy borrowing of a large brokerage firm that used the stock of <a href="Tennessee%20Coal%2C%20Iron%20and%20Railroad%20Company">Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company</a> (TC&I) as <a href="Collateral%20%28finance%29">collateral</a>. Collapse of TC&I's stock price was averted by an emergency takeover by Morgan's <a href="U.S.%20Steel%20Corporation">U.S. Steel Corporation</a>—a move approved by <a href="Trust-busting">anti-monopolist</a> president <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>. The following year, Senator <a href="Nelson%20W.%20Aldrich">Nelson W. Aldrich</a>, father-in-law of John D. Rockefeller Jr., established and chaired a commission to investigate the crisis and propose future solutions, leading to the creation of the <a href="Federal%20Reserve%20System">Federal Reserve System</a>.

When United States President <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> allowed the charter of the <a href="Second%20Bank%20of%20the%20United%20States">Second Bank of the United States</a> to expire in 1836, the U.S. was without any sort of <a href="central%20bank">central bank</a>, and the <a href="money%20supply">money supply</a> in New York City fluctuated with the country's annual agricultural cycle. Each autumn money flowed out of the city as harvests were purchased and—in an effort to attract money back—<a href="interest%20rates">interest rates</a> were raised. Foreign investors then sent their money to New York to take advantage of the higher rates. From the January 1906 <a href="Dow%20Jones%20Industrial%20Average">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> high of 103, the market began a modest correction that would continue throughout the year. The <a href="1906%20San%20Francisco%20earthquake">April 1906 earthquake</a> that devastated San Francisco contributed to the market instability, prompting an even greater flood of money from New York to San Francisco to aid reconstruction. A further stress on the money supply occurred in late 1906, when the <a href="Bank%20of%20England">Bank of England</a> raised its interest rates, partly in response to UK insurance companies paying out so much to US policyholders, and more funds remained in London than expected. From their peak in January, stock prices declined 18% by July 1906. By late September, stocks had recovered about half of their losses.

The <a href="Hepburn%20Act">Hepburn Act</a>, which gave the <a href="Interstate%20Commerce%20Commission">Interstate Commerce Commission</a> (ICC) the power to set maximum railroad rates, became law in July 1906. This depreciated the value of railroad securities. Between September 1906 and March 1907, the stock market slid, losing 7.7% of its <a href="market%20capitalization">capitalization</a>. Between March 9 and 26, stocks fell a further 9.8%. (This March collapse is sometimes referred to as a "rich man's panic".) The economy remained volatile through the summer. A number of shocks hit the system: the stock of <a href="Union%20Pacific">Union Pacific</a>—among the most common stocks used as <a href="collateral%20%28finance%29">collateral</a>—fell 50 points; that June an offering of New York City <a href="Bond%20%28finance%29">bonds</a> failed; in July the <a href="copper">copper</a> market collapsed; in August the <a href="Standard%20Oil%20Company">Standard Oil Company</a> was fined $29 million for <a href="antitrust">antitrust</a> violations. In the first nine months of 1907, stocks were lower by 24.4%.

On July 27, "<a href="The%20Commercial%20%26amp%3B%20Financial%20Chronicle">The Commercial & Financial Chronicle</a>" noted that "the market keeps unstable ... no sooner are these signs of new life in evidence than something like a suggestion of a new outflow of gold to Paris sends a tremble all through the list, and the gain in values and hope is gone". Several <a href="bank%20run">bank run</a>s occurred outside the US in 1907: in Egypt in April and May; in Japan in May and June; in Hamburg and Chile in early October. The fall season was always a vulnerable time for the banking system—combined with the roiled stock market, even a small shock could have grave repercussions.

The 1907 panic began with a <a href="Market%20manipulation">stock manipulation</a> scheme to <a href="cornering%20the%20market">corner the market</a> in <a href="F.%20Augustus%20Heinze">F. Augustus Heinze</a>'s <a href="United%20Copper">United Copper Company</a>. Heinze had made a fortune as a <a href="copper">copper</a> magnate in <a href="Butte%2C%20Montana">Butte, Montana</a>. In 1906 he moved to New York City, where he formed a close relationship with notorious <a href="Wall%20Street">Wall Street</a> banker <a href="Charles%20W.%20Morse">Charles W. Morse</a>. Morse had once successfully cornered New York City's <a href="ice%20trade">ice market</a>, and together with Heinze gained control of many banks—the pair served on at least six <a href="national%20bank">national bank</a>s, ten <a href="state%20bank">state bank</a>s, five <a href="trust%20companies">trust companies</a> and four <a href="insurance">insurance</a> firms.
Augustus' brother, Otto, devised the scheme to corner United Copper, believing that the Heinze family already controlled a majority of the company. He also believed that a significant number of the Heinze's <a href="Share%20%28finance%29">shares</a> had been <a href="securities%20lending">borrowed</a>, and <a href="short%20%28finance%29">sold short</a>, by speculators betting that the stock price would drop, and that they could thus repurchase the borrowed shares cheaply, pocketing the difference. Otto proposed a <a href="short%20squeeze">short squeeze</a>, in which the Heinzes would aggressively purchase as many remaining shares as possible, and then force the short sellers to pay for their borrowed shares. The aggressive purchasing would drive up the share price, and, being unable to find shares elsewhere, the short sellers would have no option but to turn to the Heinzes, who could then name their price.

To finance the scheme, Otto, Augustus and Charles Morse met with <a href="Charles%20T.%20Barney">Charles T. Barney</a>, president of the city's third-largest trust, the <a href="Knickerbocker%20Trust%20Company">Knickerbocker Trust Company</a>. Barney had provided financing for previous Morse schemes. Morse, however, cautioned Otto that in order to attempt the squeeze, Otto needed much more money than Barney had, and Barney declined to provide funding. Otto decided to attempt the corner anyway. On Monday, October 14, he began aggressively purchasing shares of United Copper, which rose in one day from $39 to $52 per share. On Tuesday (Oct. 15), he issued the call for short sellers to return the borrowed stock. The share price rose to nearly $60, but the short sellers were able to find plenty of United Copper shares from sources other than the Heinzes. Otto had misread the market, and the share price of United Copper began to collapse.

The stock closed at $30 on Tuesday and fell to $10 by Wednesday (Oct. 16). Otto Heinze was ruined. The stock of United Copper was traded outside the hall of the <a href="New%20York%20Stock%20Exchange">New York Stock Exchange</a>, literally an outdoor market "on the curb" (this curb market would later become the <a href="American%20Stock%20Exchange">American Stock Exchange</a>). After the crash, "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>" reported, "Never has there been such wild scenes on the Curb, so say the oldest veterans of the outside market".

The failure of the corner left Otto unable to meet his obligations and sent his brokerage house, Gross & Kleeberg, into bankruptcy. On Thursday, October 17, the New York Stock Exchange suspended Otto's trading privileges. As a result of United Copper's collapse, the State Savings Bank of Butte Montana (owned by F. Augustus Heinze) announced its insolvency. The Montana bank had held United Copper stock as <a href="Collateral%20%28finance%29">collateral</a> against some of its lending and had been a <a href="correspondent%20bank">correspondent bank</a> for the <a href="Mercantile%20National%20Bank">Mercantile National Bank</a> in New York City, of which F. Augustus Heinze was then president.

F. Augustus Heinze's association with the corner and the insolvent State Savings Bank proved too much for the board of the Mercantile to accept. Although they forced him to resign before lunch time, by then it was too late. As news of the collapse spread, depositors rushed "en masse" to withdraw money from the Mercantile National Bank. The Mercantile had enough capital to withstand a few days of withdrawals, but depositors began to pull cash from the banks of the Heinzes' associate Charles W. Morse. Runs occurred at Morse's National Bank of North America and the New Amsterdam National. Afraid of the impact the tainted reputations of Augustus Heinze and Morse could have on the banking system, the <a href="New%20York%20Clearing%20House">New York Clearing House</a> (a consortium of the city's banks) forced Morse and Heinze to resign all banking interests. By the weekend after the failed corner, there was not yet systemic panic. Funds were withdrawn from Heinze-associated banks, only to be deposited with other banks in the city.

A week later many regional stock exchanges throughout the nation were closing or limiting trading. For example, the <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a> city's <a href="Pittsburgh%20Stock%20Exchange">stock exchange</a> closed for three months starting on October 23, 1907.

In the early 1900s, <a href="Trust%20company">trust companies</a> were booming; in the decade before 1907, their assets had grown by 244%. During the same period, national bank assets grew by 97%, while state banks in New York increased by 82%. The leaders of the high-flying trusts were mainly prominent members of New York's financial and social circles. One of the most respected was <a href="Charles%20T.%20Barney">Charles T. Barney</a>, whose late father-in-law <a href="William%20Collins%20Whitney">William Collins Whitney</a> was a famous financier. Barney's <a href="Knickerbocker%20Trust%20Company">Knickerbocker Trust Company</a> was the third-largest trust in New York.

Because of past association with Charles W. Morse and F. Augustus Heinze, on Monday, October 21, the board of the Knickerbocker asked that Barney resign (depositors may have first begun to pull deposits from the Knickerbocker on October 18, prompting the concern). That day, the <a href="National%20Bank%20of%20Commerce%20%28Kansas%20City%29">National Bank of Commerce</a> where J.P. Morgan was a dominant factor, announced it would not serve as <a href="Clearing%20house%20%28finance%29">clearing house</a> for the Knickerbocker. On October 22, the Knickerbocker faced a classic bank run. From the bank's opening, the crowd grew. As "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" reported, "as fast as a depositor went out of the place ten people and more came asking for their money [and the police] were asked to send some men to keep order". Two van loads of notes were quickly unloaded, yet even this failed to calm the panic stricken depositors. Directors and other officials of the Trust forced their way through the crowd, assuring them that everyone would be paid. In less than three hours, $8 million was withdrawn from the Knickerbocker. Shortly after noon it was forced to suspend operations.

As news spread, other banks and trust companies were reluctant to lend any money. The interest rates on loans to brokers at the stock exchange soared to 70% and, with brokers unable to get money, stock prices fell to a low not seen since December 1900. The panic quickly spread to two other large trusts, Trust Company of America and Lincoln Trust Company. By Thursday, October 24, a chain of failures littered the street: Twelfth Ward Bank, Empire City Savings Bank, Hamilton Bank of New York, First National Bank of Brooklyn, International Trust Company of New York, Williamsburg Trust Company of Brooklyn, Borough Bank of Brooklyn, Jenkins Trust Company of Brooklyn and the Union Trust Company of Providence.

When the chaos began to shake the confidence of New York's banks, the city's most famous banker was out of town. <a href="J.%20P.%20Morgan">J. P. Morgan</a>, the eponymous president of <a href="J.P.%20Morgan%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">J.P. Morgan & Co.</a>, was attending a church convention in <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a>. Morgan was not only the city's wealthiest and most well-connected banker, but he had experience with other similar financial crises—he had helped rescue the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury">U.S. Treasury</a> during the <a href="Panic%20of%201893">Panic of 1893</a>. As news of the crisis gathered, Morgan returned to Wall Street from his convention late on the night of Saturday, October 19. The following morning, the <a href="The%20Morgan%20Library%20%26amp%3B%20Museum">library</a> of Morgan's <a href="brownstone">brownstone</a> at Madison Avenue and 36th St. had become a revolving door of New York City bank and trust company presidents arriving to share information about (and seek help surviving) the impending crisis.

Morgan and his associates examined the books of the Knickerbocker Trust and decided it was insolvent, so they did not intervene to stop the run. Its failure, however, triggered runs on even healthy trusts, prompting Morgan to take charge of the rescue operation. On the afternoon of Tuesday, October 22, the president of the Trust Company of America asked Morgan for assistance. That evening Morgan conferred with <a href="George%20Fisher%20Baker">George F. Baker</a>, the president of First National Bank, <a href="James%20Stillman">James Stillman</a> of the National City Bank of New York (the ancestor of <a href="Citibank">Citibank</a>), and the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">United States Secretary of the Treasury</a>, <a href="George%20B.%20Cortelyou">George B. Cortelyou</a>. Cortelyou said that he was ready to deposit government money in the banks to help shore up their deposits. After an overnight audit of the Trust Company of America showed the institution to be sound, on Wednesday afternoon Morgan declared, "This is the place to stop the trouble, then."

As a run began on the Trust Company of America, Morgan worked with Stillman and Baker to liquidate the company's assets to allow the bank to pay depositors. The bank survived to the close of business, but Morgan knew that additional money would be needed to keep it solvent through the following day. That night he assembled the presidents of the other trust companies and held them in a meeting until midnight, when they agreed to provide loans of $8.25 million to allow the Trust Company of America to stay open the next day. On Thursday morning Cortelyou deposited around $25 million into a number of New York banks. <a href="John%20D.%20Rockefeller">John D. Rockefeller</a>, the wealthiest man in the United States, deposited a further $10 million in Stillman's National City Bank. Rockefeller's massive deposit left the National City Bank with the deepest reserves of any bank in the city. To instill public confidence, Rockefeller phoned <a href="Melville%20Elijah%20Stone">Melville Stone</a>, the manager of the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a>, and told him that he would pledge half of his wealth to maintain U.S. credit.

Despite the infusion of cash, the banks of New York were reluctant to make the short-term loans they typically provided to facilitate daily stock trades. Prices on the exchange began to <a href="Stock%20market%20crash">crash</a>, owing to the lack of funds to finance purchases. At 1:30 p.m. Thursday, October 24, Ransom Thomas, the president of the <a href="New%20York%20Stock%20Exchange">New York Stock Exchange</a>, rushed to Morgan's offices to tell him that he would have to close the exchange early. Morgan was emphatic that an early close of the exchange would be catastrophic.

Morgan summoned the presidents of the city's banks to his office. They started to arrive at 2 p.m.; Morgan informed them that as many as 50 stock exchange houses would fail unless $25 million was raised in 10 minutes. By 2:16 p.m., 14 bank presidents had pledged $23.6 million to keep the stock exchange afloat. The money reached the market at 2:30 p.m., in time to finish the day's trading, and by the 3 o'clock market close, $19 million had been loaned out. Disaster was averted. Morgan usually eschewed the press, but as he left his offices that night he made a statement to reporters: "If people will keep their money in the banks, everything will be all right".

Friday, however, saw more panic on the exchange. Morgan again approached the bank presidents, but this time was only able to convince them to pledge $9.7 million. In order for this money to keep the exchange open, Morgan decided the money could not be used for <a href="margin%20%28finance%29">margin sales</a>. The volume of trading on Friday was 2/3 that of Thursday. The markets again narrowly made it to the closing bell.

Morgan, Stillman, Baker and the other city bankers were unable to pool money indefinitely. Even the U.S. Treasury was low on funds. Public confidence needed to be restored, and on Friday evening the bankers formed two committees—one to persuade the clergy to calm their congregations on Sunday, and second to explain to the press the various aspects of the financial rescue package. Europe's most famous banker, <a href="Nathan%20Rothschild%2C%201st%20Baron%20Rothschild">Lord Rothschild</a>, sent word of his "admiration and respect" for Morgan. In an attempt to gather confidence, the Treasury Secretary Cortelyou agreed that if he returned to Washington it would send a signal to Wall Street that the worst had passed.

To ensure a free flow of funds on Monday, the New York Clearing House issued $100 million in loan certificates to be traded between banks to settle balances, allowing them to retain cash reserves for depositors. Reassured both by the clergy and the newspapers, and with bank balance sheets flush with cash, a sense of order returned to New York that Monday.

Unbeknownst to Wall Street, a new crisis was being averted in the background. On Sunday, Morgan's associate, <a href="George%20Walbridge%20Perkins">George Perkins</a>, was informed that the City of New York required at least $20 million by November 1 or it would go bankrupt. The city tried to raise money through a standard bond issue, but failed to gather enough financing. On Monday and again on Tuesday, <a href="Mayor%20of%20New%20York%20City">New York Mayor</a> <a href="George%20B.%20McClellan%20Jr.">George McClellan</a> approached Morgan for assistance. In an effort to avoid the disastrous signal that a New York City bankruptcy would send, Morgan contracted to purchase $30 million worth of city bonds.

Although calm was largely restored in New York by Saturday, November 2, yet another crisis loomed. One of the exchange's largest brokerage firms, <a href="Moore%20%26amp%3B%20Schley">Moore & Schley</a>, was heavily in debt and in danger of collapse. The firm had borrowed heavily, using shares of the <a href="Tennessee%20Coal%2C%20Iron%20and%20Railroad%20Company">Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company</a> (TC&I) as collateral. With the value of the thinly traded stock under pressure, many banks would likely call the loans of Moore & Schley on Monday and force an "en masse" liquidation of the firm's stock. If that occurred it would send TC&I shares plummeting, devastating Moore and Schley and triggering further panic in the market.

To avert the collapse of Moore & Schley, Morgan called an emergency conference at his <a href="The%20Morgan%20Library%20%26amp%3B%20Museum">library</a> Saturday morning. A proposal was made that the <a href="U.S.%20Steel%20Corporation">U.S. Steel Corporation</a>, a company Morgan had helped form through the merger of the steel companies of <a href="Andrew%20Carnegie">Andrew Carnegie</a> and <a href="Elbert%20Henry%20Gary">Elbert Gary</a>, would acquire TC&I. This would effectively save Moore & Schley and avert the crisis. The executives and board of U.S. Steel studied the situation and offered to either loan Moore & Schley $5 million, or buy TC&I for $90 a share. By 7 p.m. an agreement had not been reached and the meeting adjourned.

By then, Morgan was drawn into another situation. There was deep concern that the Trust Company of America and the Lincoln Trust might fail to open on Monday due to continuing runs by depositors. On Saturday evening 40–50 bankers gathered at the library to discuss the crisis, with the clearing-house bank presidents in the East room and the trust company executives in the West room. Morgan and those dealing with the Moore & Schley situation moved to the librarian's office. There Morgan told his counselors that he would agree to help shore up Moore & Schley only if the trust companies would work together to bail out their weakest brethren. The discussion among the bankers continued late into Saturday night but without much progress. Around midnight, J. P. Morgan informed a leader of the trust company presidents that keeping Moore & Schley afloat would require $25 million, and he would not commit those funds unless the problems with the trust companies could also be resolved. The trust company executives understood they would not receive further help from Morgan; they would have to finance any bailout of the two struggling trust companies.

At 3 a.m. about 120 bank and trust company officials assembled to hear a full report on the status of the failing trust companies. While the Trust Company of America was barely solvent, the Lincoln Trust Company was probably $1 million short of what it needed to cover depositor accounts. As discussion ensued, the bankers realized that Morgan had locked them in the library and pocketed the key to force a solution, the sort of strong-arm tactic he had been known to use in the past. Morgan then entered the talks and advised the trust companies that they must provide a loan of $25 million to save the weaker institutions. The trust presidents were still reluctant to act, but Morgan informed them that if they did not it would lead to a complete collapse of the banking system. Through his considerable influence, at about 4:45 a.m. he persuaded the unofficial leader of the trust companies to sign the agreement, and the remainder of the bankers followed. Having received these commitments, Morgan allowed the bankers to go home.
On Sunday afternoon and into the evening, Morgan, Perkins, Baker and Stillman, along with U.S. Steel's Gary and <a href="Henry%20Clay%20Frick">Henry Clay Frick</a>, worked at the library to finalize the deal for U.S. Steel to buy TC&I and by Sunday night had a plan for acquisition. But one obstacle remained: the <a href="anti-trust">anti-trust</a> crusading President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, who had made breaking up <a href="monopoly">monopolies</a> a focus of his presidency.

Frick and Gary traveled overnight by train to the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> to implore Roosevelt to set aside the application of the <a href="Sherman%20Antitrust%20Act">Sherman Antitrust Act</a> and allow—before the market opened—a company that already held a 60% share of the steel market to make a large acquisition. Roosevelt's secretary refused to see them, but Frick and Gary convinced <a href="James%20Rudolph%20Garfield">James Rudolph Garfield</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior">Secretary of the Interior</a>, to bypass the secretary and arrange a meeting with the president. With less than an hour before the Stock Exchange opened, Roosevelt and <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="Elihu%20Root">Elihu Root</a> began to review the proposed takeover and appreciate the crash likely to ensue if the merger was not approved. Roosevelt relented; he later recalled of the meeting, "It was necessary for me to decide on the instant before the Stock Exchange opened, for the situation in New York was such that any hour might be vital. I do not believe that anyone could justly criticize me for saying that I would not feel like objecting to the purchase under those circumstances". When news reached New York, confidence soared. The "<a href="Commercial%20%26amp%3B%20Financial%20Chronicle">Commercial & Financial Chronicle</a>" reported that "the relief furnished by this transaction was instant and far-reaching". The final crisis of the panic had been averted.

The panic of 1907 occurred during a lengthy <a href="economic%20contraction">economic contraction</a>, measured by the <a href="National%20Bureau%20of%20Economic%20Research">National Bureau of Economic Research</a> as occurring between May 1907 and June 1908. The interrelated contraction, bank panic and falling stock market resulted in significant economic disruption. Industrial production dropped further than after any previous bank run, and 1907 saw the second-highest volume of bankruptcies to that date. Production fell by 11%, imports by 26%, while unemployment rose to 8% from under 3%. Immigration dropped to 750,000 people in 1909, from 1.2 million two years earlier.

Since the end of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, the United States had experienced panics of varying severity. Economists <a href="Charles%20Calomiris">Charles Calomiris</a> and Gary Gorton rate the worst panics as those leading to widespread bank suspensions: the panics of <a href="Panic%20of%201873">1873</a>, <a href="Panic%20of%201893">1893</a>, and 1907, and a suspension in 1914. Widespread suspensions were forestalled through coordinated actions during the <a href="panic%20of%201884">1884</a> and <a href="panic%20of%201890">1890</a> panics. A bank <a href="panic%20of%201896">crisis in 1896</a>, in which there was a perceived need for coordination, is also sometimes classified as a panic.

The frequency of crises and the severity of the 1907 panic added to concern about the outsized role of J.P. Morgan and renewed impetus toward a national debate on reform. In May 1908, Congress passed the <a href="Aldrich-Vreeland%20Act">Aldrich–Vreeland Act</a>, which established the <a href="National%20Monetary%20Commission">National Monetary Commission</a> to investigate the panic and to propose legislation to regulate banking. Senator <a href="Nelson%20Aldrich">Nelson Aldrich</a> (<a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">R</a>–<a href="Rhode%20Island">RI</a>), the chairman of the National Monetary Commission, went to Europe for almost two years to study that continent's banking systems.

A significant difference between the European and U.S. banking systems was the absence of a <a href="central%20bank">central bank</a> in the United States. European states were able to extend the <a href="money%20supply">supply of money</a> during periods of low cash reserves. The belief that the U.S. economy was vulnerable without a central bank was not new. Early in 1907, banker <a href="Jacob%20Schiff">Jacob Schiff</a> of <a href="Kuhn%2C%20Loeb%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">Kuhn, Loeb & Co.</a> warned in a speech to the New York Chamber of Commerce that "unless we have a central bank with adequate control of credit resources, this country is going to undergo the most severe and far reaching money panic in its history".

Aldrich convened a secret conference with a number of the nation's leading financiers at the <a href="Jekyll%20Island%20Club">Jekyll Island Club</a>, off the coast of <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, to discuss monetary policy and the banking system in November 1910. Aldrich and <a href="Abram%20Andrew">A. P. Andrew</a> (Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Department), <a href="Paul%20Warburg">Paul Warburg</a> (representing Kuhn, Loeb & Co.), <a href="Frank%20A.%20Vanderlip">Frank A. Vanderlip</a> (James Stillman's successor as president of the National City Bank of New York), <a href="Henry%20P.%20Davison">Henry P. Davison</a> (senior partner of J. P. Morgan Company), <a href="Charles%20D.%20Norton">Charles D. Norton</a> (president of the Morgan-dominated First National Bank of New York), and <a href="Benjamin%20Strong">Benjamin Strong</a> (representing J. P. Morgan), produced a design for a "National Reserve Bank".

The final report of the National Monetary Commission was published on January 11, 1911. For nearly two years legislators debated the proposal, and it was not until December 23, 1913, that Congress passed the <a href="Federal%20Reserve%20Act">Federal Reserve Act</a>. President <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> signed the legislation immediately, and the legislation was enacted on the same day, December 23, 1913, creating the <a href="Federal%20Reserve%20System">Federal Reserve System</a>. <a href="Charles%20Sumner%20Hamlin">Charles Hamlin</a> became the Fed's first chairman, and none other than Morgan's deputy <a href="Benjamin%20Strong">Benjamin Strong</a> became president of the <a href="Federal%20Reserve%20Bank%20of%20New%20York">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</a>, the most important regional bank, with a permanent seat on the <a href="Federal%20Open%20Market%20Committee">Federal Open Market Committee</a>.

Although Morgan was briefly seen as a hero, widespread fears concerning <a href="plutocracy">plutocracy</a> and concentrated wealth soon eroded this view. Morgan's bank had survived, but the trust companies that were a growing rival to traditional banks were badly damaged. Some analysts believed that the panic had been engineered to damage confidence in trust companies so that banks would benefit. Others believed Morgan took advantage of the panic to allow his U.S. Steel company to acquire TC&I. Although Morgan lost $21 million in the panic, and the significance of the role he played in staving off worse disaster is undisputed, he also became the focus of intense scrutiny and criticism.

The chair of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Banking%20and%20Currency">House Committee on Banking and Currency</a>, Representative <a href="Ars%C3%A8ne%20Pujo">Arsène Pujo</a> (<a href="Democratic%20party%20%28United%20States%29">D</a>–<a href="Louisiana">La.</a> <a href="Louisiana%27s%207th%20congressional%20district">7th</a>), convened a special committee to investigate a "money trust", the "de facto" monopoly of Morgan and New York's other most powerful bankers. The committee issued a scathing report on the banking trade, and found that the officers of <a href="J.%20P.%20Morgan%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">J. P.

Knight Lore

Knight Lore is a 1984 <a href="action-adventure%20game">action-adventure game</a> known for popularising <a href="Isometric%20graphics%20in%20video%20games%20and%20pixel%20art">isometric graphics in video games</a>. The game was developed and published by <a href="Ultimate%20Play%20the%20Game">Ultimate Play the Game</a> and written by company founders <a href="Chris%20and%20Tim%20Stamper">Chris and Tim Stamper</a>. In "Knight Lore", the <a href="player%20character">player character</a> <a href="Sabreman">Sabreman</a> has forty days to collect objects throughout a castle and brew a cure to his <a href="lycanthropy">werewolf curse</a>. Each castle room is depicted in <a href="monochrome">monochrome</a> on <a href="flip-screen">its own screen</a> and consists of blocks to climb, obstacles to avoid, and puzzles to solve.

Ultimate released "Knight Lore" third in the Sabreman series despite having completed it first. The Stamper brothers withheld its release for a year to position the company advantageously in anticipation of the game's effect on the market. "Knight Lore" novel <a href="image%20masking">image masking</a> technique, <a href="Filmation%20engine">Filmation</a>, let images appear to pass atop and behind each other without <a href="attribute%20clash">their contents colliding</a>. This created the illusion of depth priority, which the computer did not natively support. By delaying "Knight Lore" release, Ultimate protected sales of their upcoming "<a href="Sabre%20Wulf">Sabre Wulf</a>" and created <a href="Alien%208">another Filmation game</a> before other developers could <a href="video%20game%20clone">copy</a> the style. Ultimate released the original Sabreman trilogy in quick succession in 1984 for the <a href="ZX%20Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a>. "Knight Lore" came last, in November. <a href="Porting%20of%20video%20games">Ports</a> followed for the <a href="BBC%20Micro">BBC Micro</a>, <a href="Amstrad%20CPC">Amstrad CPC</a>, <a href="MSX">MSX</a>, and <a href="Famicom%20Disk%20System">Famicom Disk System</a>. The game was later included in compilations including <a href="Rare%20%28company%29">Rare</a>'s 2015 <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a> retrospective compilation, "<a href="Rare%20Replay">Rare Replay</a>".

"Knight Lore" is regarded as a seminal work in British gaming history and has been included in multiple lists of top Spectrum games. Critics considered its technical solutions and isometric 3D style a harbinger of future game design. They praised the game's controls and atmosphere of mystery, but noted its <a href="difficulty%20level">difficult gameplay</a> and criticised its sound and occasional graphical slowdown. "Knight Lore" was the best-selling game of January 1985 and was named 1984 <a href="game%20of%20the%20year">game of the year</a> by the <a href="Golden%20Joystick%20Awards">Golden Joystick Awards</a> and "<a href="Popular%20Computing%20Weekly">Popular Computing Weekly</a>" readers. Though it was not the first isometric 3D video game, "Knight Lore" popularised the format. When the isometric, flip-screen style fell out of fashion, "Knight Lore" influence persisted in <a href="computer%20role-playing%20games">computer role-playing games</a>. Retrospective reviewers remember the game as the first to offer an exploratory "world" rather than a flat surface, but consider its controls outdated and frustrating in the thirty years since its release.

The player, as Sabreman, has been bitten by the Sabre Wulf and now <a href="lycanthropy">transforms into a werewolf</a> at nightfall. He has 40 days to collect items throughout a strange castle and brew a cure for his curse. An onscreen timer shows the progression of day into night, when Sabreman changes to a werewolf, returning to human form at sunrise. Some of the castle's monsters only attack Sabreman when he is a werewolf. The <a href="game%20over">game ends</a> if the player does not finish the cure in forty days. The game's only directions are given through a poem included with the game's cassette tape.

Melkhior the wizard's castle consists of a series of 128 rooms, each displayed on a single, non-scrolling screen. Sabreman must navigate the 3D maze of stone blocks in each room, usually to retrieve a collectible object, whilst avoiding spikes and enemies, which kill him on contact. The player starts with five <a href="Health%20%28gaming%29">lives</a>, and loses one for each death; running out of lives ends the game. Stone blocks serve as platforms for the player to jump between; some fall under the player's weight, some move of their own accord, and some can be pushed by ghosts. Sabreman jumps higher when in werewolf form, which helps in specific puzzles. The player often needs to move blocks to reach distant objects, which are then used as platforms to reach areas in other puzzles. To complete the game, the player must return 14 sequential objects from throughout the castle to the wizard's cauldron room. At the end of the game, the player receives a final <a href="score%20%28game%29">score</a> based on the remaining time and amount of the quest completed.

<a href="Ultimate%20Play%20the%20Game">Ultimate Play the Game</a>, represented by its co-founding brothers, <a href="Tim%20and%20Chris%20Stamper">Tim and Chris Stamper</a>, was uncommonly taciturn in matters of press and marketing, though they provided some details on "Knight Lore" development to "<a href="Crash%20%28magazine%29">Crash</a>" magazine. While "Knight Lore" was released as the third game in the Sabreman series, the Stamper brothers had finished it first. They withheld the game for about a year for market reasons: they thought that "Knight Lore" advancements—copyrighted as the <a href="Filmation%20engine">Filmation engine</a>—would hurt sales of their upcoming "<a href="Sabre%20Wulf">Sabre Wulf</a>", and used the extra time to prepare another Filmation game ("<a href="Alien%208">Alien 8</a>") to preempt the sales that would be lost when other publishers would try to <a href="video%20game%20clone">copy the technique</a>. "We just had to sit on it because everyone else was so far behind," Tim Stamper recalled. "Sabre Wulf" was released to commercial and critical success in 1984. "Alien 8" and the next two Sabreman titles—"<a href="Underwurlde">Underwurlde</a>" and "Knight Lore"—followed in close succession before the end of the year.

Filmation and "Knight Lore" graphical novelty lay in how images could render without overlapping. Filmation introduced "masked <a href="Sprite%20%28computer%20graphics%29">sprites</a>" whereas earlier games used "planar sprites", which overlapped without regard for depth order. Chris Stamper's solution was to use <a href="Mask%20%28computing%29%23Image%20masks">image masking</a>. A mask is a version of an image that defines a background from the subject matter in different colours. When <a href="logical%20conjunction">combining</a> the mask and the on-screen composite image, the mask's "background" data was ignored and a hole in the shape of the desired image sprite was added to the background. This was filled in with the sprite's details. Thus, rooms in "Knight Lore" were drawn one sprite at a time through this masking method. In more recent times, contemporary images render with layer priority set at the individual pixel level. "Knight Lore" is depicted in <a href="monochrome">monochrome</a> that changes between rooms so as to avoid <a href="attribute%20clash">attribute clash</a>, a computing limitation wherein an object's colour interfered with those of others in close proximity.

Ultimate released "Knight Lore" for the <a href="ZX%20Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a> in November 1984. In a press release, they announced the game as the beginning of a new class of adventure games and "the very pinnacle of software development on the 48K Spectrum". As standard for the cryptic company, Ultimate did not circulate screenshots of the game in its press materials or cover art. "Knight Lore" was subsequently released for the <a href="BBC%20Micro">BBC Micro</a>, <a href="Amstrad%20CPC">Amstrad CPC</a>, and <a href="MSX">MSX</a> later in 1985. The Amstrad version upgraded the monochromatic colouring to a two-colour foreground setup. <a href="Jaleco">Jaleco</a> released versions of "Knight Lore" for MSX and, later, the <a href="Famicom%20Disk%20System">Famicom Disk System</a>. The latter 1986 release barely resembled its namesake. Ultimate asked Shahid Ahmad, who developed the "Knight Lore"-inspired "<a href="Chimera%20%28video%20game%29">Chimera</a>" (1985), to develop a "Knight Lore" port for the <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore 64</a>, but this did not come to fruition. "Knight Lore" later appeared in the Spectrum version of the 1986 compilation "They Sold a Million II" and the 2015 <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a> compilation of 30 Ultimate and Rare titles "<a href="Rare%20Replay">Rare Replay</a>".

Computer game magazines lauded "Knight Lore", writing that its graphics were the first of its kind and marked a <a href="Sea%20change%20%28idiom%29">sea change</a> from its contemporaries. "<a href="Computer%20%26amp%3B%20Video%20Games">Computer & Video Games</a>" ("CVG") wrote that they had never seen graphics of its calibre and that it lived up to Ultimate's hype. Peter Sweasey of "Home Computing Weekly" was left speechless and predicted that "Knight Lore" would change the market. "Crash" said it was unlikely to be surpassed as the Spectrum's best game. "Crash" selected "Knight Lore" as a "Crash Smash" recommendation in its January 1985 issue. "Knight Lore" was the best selling game in the United Kingdom that month. "<a href="Popular%20Computing%20Weekly">Popular Computing Weekly</a>" readers named "Knight Lore" their 1984 arcade game and overall <a href="game%20of%20the%20year">game of the year</a>. "Knight Lore" was also named "CVG" game of the year at their 1985 <a href="Golden%20Joystick%20Awards">Golden Joystick Awards</a> event, and Ultimate was named both developer and programmer of the year.

"Knight Lore" atmosphere, which "<a href="Sinclair%20User">Sinclair User</a>" described as a "crepuscular world of claustrophobic menace", inspired many curious questions on the part of the adventurer in contemporaneous 1985 reviews. "Crash" appreciated the imaginative mystery of the game as they attempted to answer why Sabreman turns into a werewolf, who they preferred to play as, and what the collectible objects throughout the castle do. Sabreman's werewolf transformation sequence, in particular, annoyed "CVG" and traumatised players, according to "Well Played", a book of academic <a href="close%20reading">close reading</a>s of video games, as players empathised with the suffering Sabreman. The game design gave the impression that the castle was far grander in scale than it was in reality, and "Crash" wrote that the game's novel eight-way direction scheme suited the 3D space. "Crash" compared "Knight Lore" stylistically to the 1984 "<a href="Avalon%20%28video%20game%29">Avalon</a>", but suggested that the former had bolder visuals. The magazine preferred "Knight Lore" to its predecessor ("Underwurlde") and one critic even considered the former to be Ultimate's best game.

"Crash" noted how "Knight Lore" masking technique addressed issues of <a href="Flicker%20%28screen%29">flicker</a> and attribute clash, and "<a href="Sinclair%20User">Sinclair User</a>" appreciated how Sabreman disappeared from view when passing behind blocks. In criticism, reviewers considered "Knight Lore" sound to be its weakest component, though "Your Spectrum" and "Clash" also identified the sometimes cruel difficulty of its gameplay. Later rooms of the castle require pixel-perfect precision, compounded by the anxiety of the running timer, and the game's animations would slow down proportional to the degree of onscreen action.

In reviews of the Amstrad release, "<a href="Amtix">Amtix</a>" noted the colour additions over the monochromatic original and wrote that "Knight Lore" was among the Amstrad's best adventures. Their one complaint was the graphical slowdown when too many elements were moving onscreen. "<a href="Amstrad%20Action">Amstrad Action</a>" shared this complaint but nevertheless named "Knight Lore" among the Amstrad's best three games—an improvement on the Spectrum release and on par with the quality of Commodore 64 titles.

"Knight Lore" is widely regarded as a seminal work in British gaming history. According to Kieron Gillen of "<a href="Rock%2C%20Paper%2C%20Shotgun">Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a>", "Knight Lore" is second only to "<a href="Elite%20%28video%20game%29">Elite</a>" (1984) as an icon of the 1980s British computer game industry. British magazine "<a href="Retro%20Gamer">Retro Gamer</a>" described players' first impressions of "Knight Lore" as "unforgettable", on par with the experience of playing "<a href="Space%20Harrier">Space Harrier</a>" (1985), "<a href="Wolfenstein%203D">Wolfenstein 3D</a>" (1992), or "<a href="Super%20Mario%2064">Super Mario 64</a>" (1996) for the first time. "Retro Gamer" recalled that "Knight Lore" striking, isometric 3D visuals were both a bold advance in game graphics and a foretelling of their future. British magazine "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" described the game's graphics engine as "the single greatest advance in the history of video games", and "Retro Gamer" compared the engine's impact to that of <a href="sound%20film">the introduction of sound in film</a>. "Knight Lore" was not the first to use isometric graphics—earlier examples include "<a href="Zaxxon">Zaxxon</a>" (1982), "<a href="Q%2Abert">Q*bert</a>" (1982), and "<a href="Ant%20Attack">Ant Attack</a>" (1983)—but its graphic style and large in-game world popularised the technique and put Ultimate and Filmation in its epicentre.

Several <a href="video%20game%20clone">video game clone</a>s were inspired by "Knight Lore". When <a href="Edge%20Games">Edge Games</a> struggled to approximate the isometric style internally, the visiting developer <a href="Bo%20Jangeborg">Bo Jangeborg</a> devised his own solution. His result, "<a href="Fairlight%20%28video%20game%29">Fairlight</a>" (1985), is regarded as another classic of the platform. Edge's version of Filmation received its own branding as "Worldmaker". Shahid Ahmad said Firebird's "Chimera" (1985) was even closer to "Knight Lore". Ahmad's "shock" and "admiration" from playing "Knight Lore" reportedly changed his life and convinced him to continue making games. He released "Chimera" on the Amstrad CPC, <a href="Atari%208-bit">Atari 8-bit</a>, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum, customising each <a href="Porting%20of%20video%20games">port</a> for the processing limitations of its hardware. By 1986, many British video game publishers had produced "Knight Lore"-style isometric games; examples include "<a href="Sweevo%27s%20World">Sweevo's World</a>", "<a href="Movie%20%28video%20game%29">Movie</a>", "<a href="Quazatron">Quazatron</a>", "<a href="Get%20Dexter">Get Dexter</a>", "<a href="Glider%20Rider%20%28video%20game%29">Glider Rider</a>", "<a href="Molecule%20Man%20%28video%20game%29">Molecule Man</a>", "<a href="Spindizzy%20%28video%20game%29">Spindizzy</a>", and "<a href="Bobby%20Bearing">Bobby Bearing</a>". Many of these titles suffered the same slowdown issues as "Knight Lore" due to too much on-screen activity.

Ultimate itself released four more Filmation games. "Alien 8" (1985) was rushed for release before developers had an opportunity to react to "Knight Lore", though "Retro Gamer" said that its rush was not noticeable, as "Alien 8" had a larger game world than "Knight Lore", with even more puzzles. "Alien 8" and "Knight Lore" are similar in gameplay, but the former is set in <a href="outer%20space">outer space</a>. With the updated Filmation II engine, "<a href="Nightshade%20%281985%20video%20game%29">Nightshade</a>" (1985) added colour and scrolling graphics (in place of <a href="flip-screen">flip-screen</a> room changes); however, "Retro Gamer" regarded its gameplay as comparatively dull. "<a href="Gunfright">Gunfright</a>" (1986), reported as the Stampers' last game, also used Filmation II and was more robust than its predecessor. "<a href="Pentagram%20%28video%20game%29">Pentagram</a>" (1986) returned to flip-screen rooms and its action-based gameplay included shooting enemies. It sold poorly and was the last Sabreman game. Meanwhile, the Stamper brothers sought to enter the burgeoning console industry. They sold Ultimate to <a href="U.S.%20Gold">U.S. Gold</a> in the mid-1980s and established <a href="Rare%20%28company%29">Rare</a> to develop <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> console games. While Ultimate's last two isometric games were of lesser quality, consumer interest in the genre endured.

The isometric, flip-screen trend continued in Britain for several years. Apart from "Fairlight", "Sweevo's World" and "Get Dexter", other isometric flip-screen games included <a href="Jon%20Ritman">Jon Ritman</a>'s "Knight Lore"-inspired "<a href="Batman%20%281986%20video%20game%29">Batman</a>" (1986), "<a href="Head%20over%20Heels%20%28video%20game%29">Head over Heels</a>" (1987), "<a href="The%20Last%20Ninja">The Last Ninja</a>" (1987), "<a href="La%20Abad%C3%ADa%20del%20Crimen">La Abadía del Crimen</a>" (1987), "<a href="Cadaver%20%28video%20game%29">Cadaver</a>" (1990), and console games "<a href="Solstice%20%28video%20game%29">Solstice</a>" (1990) and "<a href="Landstalker">Landstalker</a>" (1992). As players tired of the genre's similar reiterations, Ritman's games, in particular, brought new ideas. Sandy White, who developed the pre-"Knight Lore" isometric game "Ant Attack", was impressed at Ultimate's in-game "balance" and gutsy design decisions. The developer of "<a href="The%20Great%20Escape%20%281986%20video%20game%29">The Great Escape</a>", another isometric game, considered "Knight Lore" to be more "a rival title than an inspiration", but it still spurred him to spend nine months making "<a href="Where%20Time%20Stood%20Still">Where Time Stood Still</a>". "Retro Gamer" wrote that "Knight Lore" influence persisted 30 years later through titles such as "<a href="Populous%20%28video%20game%29">Populous</a>" (1989), "<a href="Syndicate%20%28video%20game%29">Syndicate</a>" (1993), "" (1994), and "<a href="Civilization%20II">Civilization II</a>" (1996). The style also spread to computer role-playing games like "<a href="Baldur%27s%20Gate">Baldur's Gate</a>", "", "<a href="Diablo%20%28video%20game%29">Diablo</a>", and "<a href="Fallout%20%28video%20game%29">Fallout</a>". Though "GamesRadar" Matt Cundy reported in 2009 that isometric perspective was no longer as prominent a topic in game design, in 2014, Chris Scullion of "<a href="Vice%20%28magazine%29">Vice</a>" traced "Knight Lore" isometric influence to "<a href="The%20Sims%204">The Sims 4</a>" (2014) and "<a href="Diablo%20III">Diablo III</a>" (2012).

"Knight Lore" was included in multiple lists of top Spectrum games and even top games for any platform. It inspired two <a href="fangames">fangames</a>: a 1999 sequel and a 2010 3D <a href="remake">remake</a>, which was in development for four years.

Though isometric games had existed previously, in a retrospective review, Gillen ("Rock, Paper, Shotgun") recalled that "Knight Lore" was the first game to offer a "world" with physical depth for exploration as opposed to the simple mechanics of arcade games. Jeremy Signor of "<a href="USgamer">USgamer</a>" agreed that "Knight Lore" felt more like a world than a painting and added that the game's innovative use of successive, single-screen rooms ("flip-screen") pre-dated "<a href="The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a>" by years. Gillen said the game's punishing style (unforgiving gameplay, high difficulty, awkward controls) had become obsolete in the 30 years since its release and criticised "Knight Lore" as "enormously innovative, incredibly atmospheric, and totally unplayable", suggesting that the similar "Head over Heels" (1987) had aged much better. Peter Parrish ("Eurogamer"), too, found the game frustrating, though well-made. Dan Whitehead of the same publication appreciated that the 2015 "Rare Replay" compilation version of "Knight Lore" <a href="Video%20game%20console%20emulator">emulated</a> the original's choppy animations as the ZX Spectrum's processor once struggled to render the onscreen objects.

PNC Park

PNC Park is a <a href="baseball%20park">baseball park</a> located on the <a href="North%20Shore%20%28Pittsburgh%29">North Shore</a> of <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>, Pennsylvania. It is the fifth home of the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a>, the city's <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) franchise. It opened during the <a href="2001%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">2001 MLB season</a>, after the <a href="building%20implosion">controlled implosion</a> of the Pirates' previous home, <a href="Three%20Rivers%20Stadium">Three Rivers Stadium</a>. The ballpark is sponsored by <a href="PNC%20Financial%20Services">PNC Financial Services</a>, which purchased the <a href="naming%20rights">naming rights</a> in 1998. PNC Park features a natural grass playing surface and seats 38,747 people for baseball.

Funded in conjunction with <a href="Heinz%20Field">Heinz Field</a> and the <a href="David%20L.%20Lawrence%20Convention%20Center">David L. Lawrence Convention Center</a>, the $216 million park stands along the <a href="Allegheny%20River">Allegheny River</a>, on the <a href="North%20Shore%20%28Pittsburgh%29">North Shore</a> of Pittsburgh with a view of <a href="Downtown%20Pittsburgh">Downtown Pittsburgh</a>. Plans to build a new stadium for the Pirates originated in 1991, but did not come to fruition for 5 years. Built in the style of "classic" stadiums, such as Pittsburgh's <a href="Forbes%20Field">Forbes Field</a>, PNC Park also introduced unique features, such as the use of <a href="limestone">limestone</a> in the building's facade. The park also features a riverside concourse, steel truss work, an extensive out-of-town scoreboard, and many local eateries. Constructed faster than most modern stadiums, PNC Park was built in a 24-month span.

On September 5, 1991, Pittsburgh mayor <a href="Sophie%20Masloff">Sophie Masloff</a> proposed a new 44,000-seat stadium for the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> on the city's North Side. <a href="Three%20Rivers%20Stadium">Three Rivers Stadium</a>, the Pirates' home at the time, had been designed for functionality rather than "architecture and aesthetics". The location of Three Rivers Stadium came to be criticized for being in a hard-to-access portion of the city, where traffic congestion occurred before and after games. Discussions about a new ballpark took place, but were never seriously considered until entrepreneur <a href="Kevin%20McClatchy">Kevin McClatchy</a> purchased the team in February 1996. Until McClatchy's purchase, plans about the team remaining in Pittsburgh were uncertain. In 1996, Masloff's successor, <a href="Tom%20Murphy%20%28mayor%29">Tom Murphy</a>, created the "Forbes Field II Task Force". Made up of 29 political and business leaders, the team studied the challenges of constructing a new ballpark. Their final report, published on June 26, 1996, evaluated 13 possible locations. The "North Side site" was recommended due to its affordable cost, potential to develop the surrounding area, and opportunity to incorporate the city skyline into the stadium's design. The site selected for the ballpark is just upriver from the site of early Pirates home field <a href="Exposition%20Park%20%28Pittsburgh%29">Exposition Park</a>.
After a political debate, public money was used to fund PNC Park. Originally, a <a href="sales%20tax">sales tax</a> increase was proposed to fund three projects: PNC Park, <a href="Heinz%20Field">Heinz Field</a>, and an expansion of the <a href="David%20L.%20Lawrence%20Convention%20Center">David L. Lawrence Convention Center</a>. However, after the proposal was soundly rejected in a 1997 <a href="referendum">referendum</a> known as the <a href="Regional%20Renaissance%20Initiative">Regional Renaissance Initiative</a>, the city developed "Plan B". Similarly controversial, the alternative proposal was labeled "Scam B" by opponents. Some members of the <a href="Allegheny%20Regional%20Asset%20District">Allegheny Regional Asset District</a> felt that the Pirates' pledge of $40 million toward the new stadium was too little, while others criticized the amount of public money allocated for Plan B. One member of the Allegheny Regional Asset District board called the use of tax dollars "corporate welfare". The plan, totaling $809 million, was approved by the Allegheny Regional Asset District board on July 9, 1998—with $228 million allotted for PNC Park. Shortly after Plan B was approved, the Pirates made a deal with Pittsburgh city officials to remain in the city until at least 2031.

There was popular sentiment by fans for the Pirates to name the stadium after former outfielder <a href="Roberto%20Clemente">Roberto Clemente</a>. However, locally based <a href="PNC%20Financial%20Services">PNC Financial Services</a> purchased the stadium's naming rights in August 1998. As per the agreement, <a href="PNC%20Financial%20Services%23PNC%20Bank">PNC Bank</a> will pay the Pirates approximately $2 million each year through 2020, and also has a full-service PNC branch at the stadium. The total cost of PNC Park was $216 million. Shortly after the naming rights deal was announced, the city of Pittsburgh renamed the 6th Street Bridge near the southeast corner of the site of the park the <a href="Roberto%20Clemente%20Bridge">Roberto Clemente Bridge</a> as a compromise to fans who had wanted the park named after Clemente.

Kansas City-based <a href="Populous%20%28company%29">Populous</a> (then HOK Sport), which designed many other major league ballparks of the late 20th and early 21st century, designed the ballpark. The design and construction management team consisted of the Dick Corporation and Barton Malow. An effort was made in the design of PNC Park to salute other "classic style" ballparks, such as <a href="Fenway%20Park">Fenway Park</a>, <a href="Wrigley%20Field">Wrigley Field</a>, and Pittsburgh's <a href="Forbes%20Field">Forbes Field</a>; the design of the ballpark's archways, steel truss work, and light standards are results of this goal. PNC Park was the first two-deck ballpark to be built in the United States since <a href="Milwaukee%20County%20Stadium">Milwaukee County Stadium</a> opened in <a href="1953%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1953</a>. The park features a 24 by 42 foot (7.3 by 12.8 m) <a href="Sony">Sony</a> <a href="JumboTron">JumboTron</a>, which is accompanied by the first-ever LED video boards in an outdoor MLB stadium. PNC Park is the first stadium to feature an out-of-town scoreboard with the score, <a href="inning">inning</a>, number of <a href="Out%20%28baseball%29">outs</a>, and <a href="Baserunning">base runners</a> for every other game being played around the league.
Ground was broken for PNC Park on April 7, 1999, after a ceremony to rename the Sixth Street Bridge as the "<a href="Roberto%20Clemente%20Bridge">Roberto Clemente Bridge</a>" in honor of the late Pirate <a href="Roberto%20Clemente">Roberto Clemente</a>. As part of original plans to create an enjoyable experience for fans, the bridge is closed to vehicular traffic on game days to allow spectators to park in <a href="Downtown%20Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh's Golden Triangle</a> and walk across the bridge to the stadium. PNC Park was built with <a href="Kasota%20limestone">Kasota limestone</a> shipped from a <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> river valley, to contrast the brick bases of other modern stadiums. The stadium was constructed over a 24-month span—at the time of construction, three months faster than any other modern major league ballpark—and the Pirates played their first game less than two years after groundbreaking. The quick construction was accomplished with the use of special computers, which relayed building plans to builders 24 hours per day. In addition, all 23 labor unions involved in the construction signed a pact that they would not <a href="Strike%20action">strike</a> during the building process. As a result of union involvement and attention to safety regulations, the construction manager, the Dick Corporation, received a merit award for its safety practices from the <a href="Occupational%20Safety%20and%20Health%20Administration">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a>.
Statues of Pirates' <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">Hall of Famers</a> <a href="Honus%20Wagner">Honus Wagner</a>, Roberto Clemente, <a href="Willie%20Stargell">Willie Stargell</a> and <a href="Bill%20Mazeroski">Bill Mazeroski</a> are positioned at various points outside of PNC Park. Wagner and Clemente's statues were previously located outside of Three Rivers Stadium, and after the venue was imploded, the two statues were removed from their locations, refurbished, and relocated outside PNC Park. Wagner's statue was originally unveiled at Forbes Field in 1955. The base of Clemente's statue is shaped like a <a href="Baseball%20field">baseball diamond</a>, with dirt from three of the fields Clemente played at—Santurce Field in <a href="Carolina%2C%20Puerto%20Rico">Carolina, Puerto Rico</a>, Forbes Field, and Three Rivers Stadium—at each base. On October 1, 2000, after the final game at Three Rivers Stadium, Stargell threw out the ceremonial last pitch. He was presented with a model of a statue that was to be erected in his honor outside of PNC Park. The statue was officially unveiled on April 7, 2001; however, Stargell did not attend due to health problems and died of a stroke two days later. A statue for <a href="Bill%20Mazeroski">Bill Mazeroski</a> was added at the right field entrance, at the south end of Mazeroski Way, during the <a href="2010%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">2010 season</a>. This was the 50th anniversary of the Pirates' <a href="1960%20World%20Series">1960 World Series</a> championship, which Mazeroski clinched with a Game 7 walk-off home run at Forbes Field. The statue itself was designed based on that event.

The Pirates opened PNC Park with two exhibition games against the <a href="2001%20New%20York%20Mets%20season">New York Mets</a>—the first of which was played on March 31, 2001. The first official baseball game played in PNC Park was between the <a href="2001%20Cincinnati%20Reds%20season">Cincinnati Reds</a> and the Pirates, on April 9, 2001. The Reds won the game by the final score of 8–2. The first pitch—a ball—was thrown from Pittsburgh's <a href="Todd%20Ritchie">Todd Ritchie</a> to <a href="Barry%20Larkin">Barry Larkin</a>. In the top of the first inning, Pittsburgh native <a href="Sean%20Casey%20%28baseball%29">Sean Casey</a>'s two-run home run was the first hit in the park. The first Pirates' batter, <a href="Adrian%20Brown%20%28baseball%29">Adrian Brown</a>, struck out; however, later in the inning <a href="Jason%20Kendall">Jason Kendall</a> singled—the first hit by a Pirate in their new stadium.

PNC Park had an average attendance of 30,742 people per game throughout its inaugural season, though it would drop approximately 27% the following season to 22,594 spectators per game. Throughout the <a href="2001%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">2001 season</a>, businesses in downtown and on the Northside of Pittsburgh showed a 20–25% increase in business on Pirate game days.

Pirates' vice-president Steve Greenberg said, "We said when construction began that we would build the best ballpark in baseball, and we believe we've done that." Major League Baseball executive <a href="Paul%20Beeston">Paul Beeston</a> said the park was "the best he's seen so far in baseball". Many of the workers who built the park said that it was the nicest that they had seen. Jason Kendall, Pittsburgh's catcher at the opening of the park, called PNC Park "the most beautiful ballpark in the game". Different elements of PNC Park were used in the design of New York's <a href="Citi%20Field">Citi Field</a>.
Upon opening in 2001, PNC Park was praised by fans and media alike. <a href="ESPN.com">ESPN.com</a> writer <a href="Jim%20Caple">Jim Caple</a> ranked PNC Park as the best stadium in Major League Baseball, with a score of 95 out of 100. Caple compared the park to <a href="Frank%20Lloyd%20Wright">Frank Lloyd Wright</a>'s <a href="Fallingwater">Fallingwater</a>, calling the stadium itself "perfect", and citing high ticket prices as the only negative aspect of visiting the park. Jay Ahjua, author of "Fields of Dreams: A Guide to Visiting and Enjoying All 30 Major League Ballparks", called PNC Park one of the "top ten places to watch the game". Eric Enders, author of "Ballparks Then and Now" and co-author of "Big League Ballparks: The Complete Illustrated History", said it was "everything a baseball stadium could hope to be" and "an immediate contender for the title of best baseball park ever built". In 2008, "<a href="Men%27s%20Fitness">Men's Fitness</a>" named the park one of "10 big league parks worth seeing this summer". A 2010 unranked list of "America's 7 Best Ballparks" published by <a href="ABC%20News">ABC News</a> noted that PNC Park "combines the best features of yesterday's ballparks—rhythmic archways, steel trusswork and a natural grass playing field—with the latest in fan and player amenities and comfort".

An exhibit honoring Pittsburgh's <a href="Negro%20league%20baseball">Negro league baseball</a> teams was introduced in 2006. Located by the stadium's left field entrance, the display features statues of seven players who competed for the city's <a href="Homestead%20Grays">Homestead Grays</a> and <a href="Pittsburgh%20Crawfords">Pittsburgh Crawfords</a>, including <a href="Josh%20Gibson">Josh Gibson</a> and <a href="Satchel%20Paige">Satchel Paige</a>. The exhibit also includes the Legacy Theatre, a 25-seat facility that plays a film about Pittsburgh's history with the Negro leagues. The Pirates donated the statues to the Josh Gibson Foundation in 2015.
In 2007, <a href="Allegheny%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Allegheny County</a> passed a <a href="Smoking%20ban">ban on smoking</a> in most public places, thus making PNC Park completely smoke-free. Before the <a href="2008%20Pittsburgh%20Pirates%20season">2008 season</a>, the Pirates made multiple alterations to PNC Park. The biggest change was removing the <a href="Outback%20Steakhouse">Outback Steakhouse</a> located in the left field stands, and adding a new restaurant known as "The Hall of Fame Club". Unlike its predecessor, "The Hall of Fame Club" is open to all ticket-holders on game days; it includes an outdoor patio with a bar and seats with a view of the field. The Pirates feature bands in "The Hall of Fame Club" after the completion of select games—the first performance was by <a href="Iron%20City%20Houserockers">Joe Grushecky and the Houserockers</a>. The Pirates also announced a program to make the park more environmentally friendly, by integrating "greening initiatives, sustainable business practices and educational outreach". In addition, club and suite sections were outfitted with new televisions.

In 2012, the "Budweiser Bow Tie", a 5,000-square foot bar and lounge located in the right field corner of the ballpark, was added. The section includes ticketed seats along with areas for groups and the general public. This addition was expected to cost about $1 million. For the 2015 season, many additions to the park took place for better fan experience. One of the additions to the park is the left field terrace. It has 2 levels for standing room, with 250 feet of drink rails. The terrace fills the gap between the left field bleachers and the Rivertowne Brewing Hall of Fame Club and is open to any fan with a ticket. Another addition includes a new outdoor patio that overlooks center field, right next to the terraces. The patio is now known as "The Porch." The Porch features bar tables and outdoor sofa-style seating, and accommodates groups of 25 people. Among the other additions for the 2015 season are: The Corner, which is a full-service bar at the very base of the left field rotunda with 9 flat screen TVs; Terrace Bar, which is a fully operating bar for fans in the upper concourse; and Pirates Outfitters, an additional merchandise shop located next to the home-plate entrance. The Pirates paid all costs for the additions to the park.

PNC Park hosted the 77th <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">Major League Baseball All-Star Game</a> on July 11, 2006. The American League defeated the National League 3–2, with 38,904 spectators in attendance. The first All-Star Game in PNC Park, it was the 5th All-Star Game hosted in Pittsburgh, and the first since 1994. During the game, late Pirate Roberto Clemente was honored with the Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award; his wife, Vera, accepted on his behalf. The stadium hosted the <a href="2006%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game%23Home%20Run%20Derby">Century 21 Home Run Derby</a> the previous evening; <a href="Ryan%20Howard">Ryan Howard</a>, of the <a href="Philadelphia%20Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a>, won the title. During the Derby, Howard and <a href="David%20Ortiz">David Ortiz</a> hit home runs into the Allegheny River.

On September 28, 2012 PNC Park saw its first <a href="no-hitter">no-hitter</a> when Reds pitcher <a href="Homer%20Bailey">Homer Bailey</a> no-hit the Pirates, 1–0. PNC Park has yet to see a no-hitter or <a href="perfect%20game">perfect game</a> thrown by a Pirate.

On October 1, 2013, the Pirates hosted the <a href="Cincinnati%20Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a> in the <a href="2013%20National%20League%20Wild%20Card%20Game">2013 National League Wild Card Game</a>. This marked the first time a playoff game was played at PNC Park. The Pirates won 6-2, their first postseason victory since <a href="1992%20Pittsburgh%20Pirates%20season">1992</a>, in front of a record crowd of 40,629. The <a href="2014%20National%20League%20Wild%20Card%20Game">2014</a> and <a href="2015%20National%20League%20Wild%20Card%20Game">2015</a> National League Wild Card games were also played at PNC Park.

The first collegiate baseball game at PNC Park was played on May 6, 2003, between the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Panthers%20baseball">Pitt Panthers</a> and the <a href="Duquesne%20Dukes">Duquesne Dukes</a>, a rivalry that was referred to as the <a href="City%20Game">City Game</a>. Duquesne won 2–1. However, due to Duquesne's decision to disband their baseball program following the 2010 season, the series between the two schools came to an end. The PNC Park City Game series ended in Pitt's favor, four games to two, with the 2007 game canceled because of poor field conditions.

PNC Park has also hosted various concerts, including <a href="Bruce%20Springsteen%20%26amp%3B%20The%20E%20Street%20Band">Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band</a>, <a href="The%20Rolling%20Stones">The Rolling Stones</a>, <a href="Pearl%20Jam">Pearl Jam</a>, <a href="Jimmy%20Buffett">Jimmy Buffett</a>, <a href="Me%20First%20and%20the%20Gimme%20Gimmes">Me First and the Gimme Gimmes</a>, <a href="Dave%20Matthews%20Band">Dave Matthews Band</a> and <a href="Zac%20Brown%20Band">Zac Brown Band</a>.

The park also served as one of the locations for the 2010 film "<a href="She%27s%20Out%20of%20My%20League">She's Out of My League</a>" and the 2011 film "<a href="Abduction%20%282011%20film%29">Abduction</a>". Also in the 2012 film <a href="Jack%20Reacher">Jack Reacher</a>.

PNC Park has hosted various evacuation and response drills, which would be used in the event of a <a href="Terrorism">terrorist attack</a>. Members of the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Homeland%20Security">United States Department of Homeland Security</a> laid out the groundwork for the initial drill in February 2004. In May 2005, 5,000 volunteers participated in the $1 million evacuation drill, which included mock explosions. A goal of the drill was to test the response of 49 western Pennsylvania emergency agencies. In April 2006, the Department of Homeland Security worked in conjunction with the <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard">United States Coast Guard</a> to develop a plan of response for the 2006 All-Star Game. Similar exercises were conducted on the Allegheny River in 2007.

The playing surface of PNC Park is Tuckahoe Bluegrass, which is a mixture of various types of <a href="Smooth%20Meadow-grass">Kentucky Bluegrass</a>. Installed before the 2009 season, the grass surface was selected for its "high-quality pedigree that is ideal for Northern cities such as Pittsburgh". The infield dirt is a mixture known as "Dura Edge Custom Pro Infield Mix" and was designed solely for PNC Park. The 18-foot warning track is crushed <a href="Igneous%20rock">lava rock</a>. The drainage system underneath the field is capable of handling of rain per hour. The original playing surface consisted of sand-based natural grass, and was replaced before the <a href="2006%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">2006 season</a>. The playing surface also underwent a significant renovation following the 2016 season. The 2016 renovation included excavation of the top 3" of rootzone soil, importing of rootzone material with improved physical properties, deep tillage, laser grading, and installation of new Kentucky bluegrass sod. The infield skin was also excavated to a depth of 4" and replaced with new Dura Edge infield mix. Unlike most ballparks, PNC Park's home <a href="Dugout%20%28baseball%29">dugout</a> is located along the third base line instead of the first base line; giving the home team a view of the city skyline. The <a href="Baseball%20field%23Outfield%20wall">outfield fence</a> ranges from a height of in left field to in center field and in right field, a tribute to former Pirate right fielder Roberto Clemente, who wore number "21". The distance from home plate to the outfield fence ranges from in right field to in left center; the straightaway center field fence is set at . At its closest point, the <a href="Allegheny%20River">Allegheny River</a> is from the plate. On July 6, 2002, <a href="Daryle%20Ward">Daryle Ward</a> became the first player to hit the river "on the fly". On June 2, 2013, <a href="Garrett%20Jones">Garrett Jones</a> became only the second player to accomplish the feat, and was the first Pirate to do so. On May 19, 2015, Pirates first baseman Pedro Alvarez became the third person to do this, although the ball actually landed in a boat on the river rather than in the water. The longest home run in PNC Park history was 484 feet hit to left-center field by <a href="Sammy%20Sosa">Sammy Sosa</a> on April 12, 2002.
During its opening season, PNC Park's <a href="seating%20capacity">seating capacity</a> of 38,496 was the second-smallest of any major league stadium (the smallest being <a href="Fenway%20Park">Fenway Park</a>). Seats are angled toward the field and aisles are lowered to give spectators improved views of the field. The majority of the seats (26,000) are on the first level, and the highest seat in the stadium is above the playing surface. At , the batter is closer to the seats behind home plate than to the pitcher. At their closest point, seating along the baselines is from the bases. The four-level steel <a href="Rotunda%20%28architecture%29">rotunda</a> and a section above the out-of-town scoreboard offer <a href="standing-room%20only">standing-room-only</a> space. With the exception of the bleacher sections, all seats in the park offer a view of Pittsburgh's skyline.

In its opening season, PNC Park's tickets were priced between $9 and $35 for general admission. One of only two teams not to increase ticket prices entering the 2009 season, PNC Park ranked as having the third-cheapest average ticket prices in the league in 2009. Despite price increases in the 2015 season, the average ticket price at PNC Park remained in the bottom five among MLB teams. The stadium's average ticket price held between $15 and $17 from 2006-2013 (among the lowest in Major League Baseball), then rose to $18.32 in 2014, $19.99 in 2015, and $29.96 in 2016.

In the stadium's first decade, average attendance dipped under 20,000 fans per game four times. Before 2013, the Pirates had only one winning record since 1992. Through 2004, 5% of games played at PNC Park were sold out. The number of sellouts increased in 2012 and 2013; after filling PNC Park 17 times in 2012, the team played to capacity crowds at 23 games in 2013. In 2014, average attendance crossed the 30,000 mark for the first time since PNC Park's inaugural season in 2001, and remained above 30,000 in 2015 before dropping to 27,000 in 2016.

As with its predecessor, PNC Park's concessions service provider is <a href="Aramark">Aramark</a>, while the premium seating areas (The Lexus Club, PBC Level and Suites Level) are serviced by <a href="Levy%20Restaurants">Levy Restaurants</a>. The main eating concourse, known as "Tastes of Pittsburgh", features a wide range of options including traditional ballpark foods, hometown specialties, and more exotic fare like sushi. Pittsburgh's hometown specialties include <a href="Primanti%20Brothers">Primanti Brothers</a> sandwiches, whose signature item consists of meat, cheese, hand-cut French fries, tomatoes, and <a href="coleslaw">coleslaw</a> between two slices of Italian bread. Other local eateries offered include <a href="Mrs.%20T%27s%20Pierogies">Mrs. T's Pierogies</a>, <a href="Quaker%20Steak%20%26amp%3B%20Lube">Quaker Steak & Lube</a>, <a href="Augustine%27s%20Pizza">Augustine's Pizza</a>, and Benkovitz Seafood. Located behind center field seating is "Manny's BBQ", which offers various <a href="barbecue">barbecue</a> meals. It is named for former Pirates' catcher <a href="Manny%20Sanguill%C3%A9n">Manny Sanguillén</a>, who has been known to sign autographs for fans waiting in line. For the 2008 season, the Pirates created an <a href="All-you-can-eat%20seats%20%28baseball%29">all-you-can-eat section</a> in the right field corner. Fans seated in the section are allowed "unlimited hotdogs, hamburgers, nachos, salads, popcorn, peanuts, ice cream and pop" for an entire game. In addition to the food offered, fans are free to bring their own food into the stadium, a rarity among the league's ballparks.

For its first 13 years, PNC Park sold <a href="Pepsi">Pepsi</a> products, a contrast from its predecessor Three Rivers Stadium, which sold <a href="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a> products, as well as Heinz Field and <a href="Civic%20Arena%20%28Pittsburgh%29">Mellon Arena</a>. In right field, several versions of the <a href="Pepsi%20Globe">Pepsi Globe</a> as well as a Pepsi bottle were displayed on large posts behind the stands and lit up every time the Pirates hit a home run. In 2014, the Pirates switched to Coca-Cola. The Pepsi signage in right field was converted into advertising for locally based <a href="health%20insurance">health insurance</a> company <a href="Highmark">Highmark</a>.

In 2016, PNC Park became the first MLB ballpark with a miniature version of a Menchie's Frozen Yogurt available for gameday guests.

PNC Park is located at exit 1B of <a href="Interstate%20279">Interstate 279</a> and within 1 mile of both <a href="Interstate%20376">Interstate 376</a> and <a href="Interstate%20579">Interstate 579</a>. The park is also served by the <a href="North%20Side%20%28PAT%20station%29">North Side</a> transit station of the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Light%20Rail">Pittsburgh subway</a> system.

Francis Tresham

Francis Tresham ( 1567 – 23 December 1605), eldest son of 
<a href="Thomas%20Tresham%20%28died%201605%29">Thomas Tresham</a> and Merial Throckmorton, was a member of the group of English provincial <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholics</a> who planned the failed <a href="Gunpowder%20Plot">Gunpowder Plot</a> of 1605, a conspiracy to assassinate King <a href="James%20VI%20and%20I">James I of England</a>.

Tresham joined the <a href="Robert%20Devereux%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Essex">Earl of Essex</a>'s failed rebellion against the government in 1601, for which he was imprisoned. Only his family's intervention and his father's money saved him from <a href="attainder">attainder</a>. Despite this, he became involved in two missions to Catholic Spain to seek support for English Catholics (then heavily persecuted), and finally with the Gunpowder Plotters.

According to his confession, Tresham joined the plot in October 1605. Its leader, <a href="Robert%20Catesby">Robert Catesby</a>, asked him to provide a large sum of money and the use of <a href="Rushton%20Hall">Rushton Hall</a>, but Tresham apparently provided neither, instead giving a much smaller amount of money to fellow plotter <a href="Thomas%20Wintour">Thomas Wintour</a>. Tresham also expressed concern that if the plot was successful, two of his brothers-in-law would be killed. An anonymous letter delivered to one of them, <a href="William%20Parker%2C%204th%20Baron%20Monteagle">William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle</a>, found its way to the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20%28England%29">English Secretary of State</a>, <a href="Robert%20Cecil%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Salisbury">Robert Cecil</a>, an event which eventually proved decisive in the conspiracy's failure.

Historians have long suspected that Tresham wrote the letter, a hypothesis that remains unproven. Catesby and Wintour shared the same suspicion and threatened to kill him, but he was able to convince them otherwise. He was arrested on 12 November and confined to the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>. In his confession, he sought to allay his involvement in the plot, but never mentioned the letter. He died of natural causes on 23 December 1605.

Born in about 1567, Francis Tresham was the eldest son of Sir <a href="Thomas%20Tresham%20%28died%201605%29">Thomas Tresham</a>, of <a href="Rushton%20Hall">Rushton Hall</a> in <a href="Northamptonshire">Northamptonshire</a>, and Meriel Throckmorton, daughter of Sir <a href="Robert%20Throckmorton">Robert Throckmorton</a> of Coughton in <a href="Warwickshire">Warwickshire</a>. According to the <a href="antiquary">antiquary</a> <a href="Anthony%20Wood%20%28antiquary%29">Anthony Wood</a>, Tresham was educated in <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a> at either <a href="St%20John%27s%20College%2C%20Oxford">St John's College</a> or <a href="Worcester%20College%2C%20Oxford">Gloucester Hall</a> or both, although biographer Mark Nicholls mentions that there appears to be no other evidence to corroborate that claim. 

Francis is said to have been a fellow prisoner with <a href="Robert%20Catesby">Robert Catesby</a> held in <a href="Wisbech%20Castle">Wisbech Castle</a> at the time of the <a href="Spanish%20Armada">Spanish Armada</a>.

He married Anne Tufton, daughter of Sir John Tufton of Hothfield in Kent, in 1593. The couple had three children, twins Lucy and Thomas (b.1598), and Elizabeth. Thomas died in infancy, Lucy became a nun in Brussels, and Elizabeth married Sir George Heneage of Hainton, Lincolnshire.

Tresham's father, born near the end of <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a>'s reign, was regarded by the Catholic community as one of its leaders. Thomas was received into the Catholic Church in 1580, and in the same year he allowed the Jesuit <a href="Edmund%20Campion">Edmund Campion</a> to stay at his house in <a href="Hoxton">Hoxton</a>. For the latter, following Campion's capture in 1581, he was tried in <a href="Star%20Chamber">Star Chamber</a>. Thomas's refusal to fully comply with his interrogators was the beginning of years of fines and spells in prison. He proclaimed the accession of <a href="James%20VI%20and%20I">James I</a> to the English throne, but the king's promises to Thomas of forestry commissions and an end to <a href="recusancy">recusancy</a> fines were not kept. His finances were seriously depleted by fines of £7,720 for recusancy, and the spending of £12,200 on the marriages of six daughters meant that when he died in 1605, his estate was £11,500 in debt.

Author <a href="Antonia%20Fraser">Antonia Fraser</a> suggests that as a young man Francis became "resentful of his father's authority and profligate with his father's money." Authors Peter Marshall and Geoffrey Scott describe him as possessing a "somewhat hot-headed nature", while another source calls him a "wild unstayed man". The Jesuit priest <a href="Oswald%20Tesimond">Oswald Tesimond</a> wrote that he was "a man of sound judgement. He knew how to look after himself, but was not much to be trusted". While still young he assaulted a man and his pregnant daughter, claiming that their family owed his father money. Tresham spent time in prison for this offence.

On 8 February 1601 he joined the <a href="Robert%20Devereux%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Essex">Earl of Essex</a> in open rebellion against the government. Essex's aim was to secure his own ambitions, but the Jesuit <a href="Henry%20Garnet">Henry Garnet</a> described the young men who accompanied him as being interested mostly in furthering the Catholic cause. Captured and imprisoned, Tresham appealed to <a href="Thomas%20Howard%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Suffolk">Katherine Howard</a>, but was rebuked. His sister, Lady Mounteagle, alerted his cousin John Throckmorton, who turned to "three most honorable parsons and one especiall instrument" for help. The identity of these individuals is unclear, but Tresham was promised freedom on the condition that over the next three months his father pay £2,100 to William Ayloffe, to "save his lyef attainder in bloode." He was released on 21 June. The experience did not dissuade him from engaging in further conspiracies; in 1602 and 1603 he was involved in the missions to Catholic Spain made by <a href="Thomas%20Wintour">Thomas Wintour</a>, Anthony Dutton (possibly an alias of <a href="John%20and%20Christopher%20Wright">Christopher Wright</a>) and <a href="Guy%20Fawkes">Guy Fawkes</a>, later dubbed by the English government as the Spanish Treason. However, upon James's accession to the throne, he told Thomas Wintour (secretary to Tresham's brother-in-law <a href="William%20Parker%2C%204th%20Baron%20Monteagle">William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle</a>), that he would "stand wholly for the King", and "to have no speech with him of Spain."

English Catholics had hoped that the persecution of their faith would end when James succeeded <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I</a>, as he appeared to hold more moderate views toward Catholics than his predecessor. But <a href="Robert%20Catesby">Robert Catesby</a>, a religious zealot also imprisoned for his involvement in the Essex rebellion, had grown tired of James's supposed perfidy and planned to kill the king. He hoped to achieve this by blowing up the <a href="Palace%20of%20Westminster%23Old%20Palace">House of Lords</a> with gunpowder and inciting a popular revolt to install James's daughter <a href="Elizabeth%20Stuart%2C%20Queen%20of%20Bohemia">Princess Elizabeth</a> as titular Queen.

Catesby had recruited 11 fellow Catholics to his cause but was running out of money. Even with his debts, with an annual income of over £3,000 Tresham was one of the wealthiest people known to the plotters, and Catesby's mother was Anne Throckmorton, an aunt of Tresham's. The two cousins had been raised together and shared a close relationship.

Despite their shared upbringing and involvement in the Spanish Treason, the conspirators chose not to reveal the plot to him until 14 October 1605, shortly after his father died, and just weeks before the planned explosion. According to his confession, the meeting took place at the home of Tresham's brother-in-law, Lord Stourton, in <a href="Clerkenwell">Clerkenwell</a>. Tresham claimed to have questioned Catesby on the morality of the plot, asking if it was spiritually "damnable". Catesby replied that it was not, at which point Tresham highlighted the danger that all Catholics would face should the plot succeed. Catesby replied, "The necessity of the Catholics" was such that "it must needs be done". He wanted two things from Tresham: £2,000, and the use of <a href="Rushton%20Hall">Rushton Hall</a>; Catesby received neither. Tresham had no money to spare, his father's debts having reduced his inheritance, although he paid a small sum to Thomas Wintour, on the understanding that the latter was to travel to the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Countries</a>. Following the meeting, he hurried back to Rushton Hall and closed his household, taking care to hide family papers (not discovered until 1838). He then returned to London with his mother and sisters, and on 2 November acquired a licence to travel abroad with his servants and horses.

Later in October, during a meeting at which Tresham was present, the conspirators discussed the fates of several notable Catholic peers. Foremost in Tresham's thoughts were the lives of two brothers-in-law, <a href="William%20Parker%2C%204th%20Baron%20Monteagle">William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle</a>, and <a href="Edward%20Stourton%2C%2010th%20Baron%20Stourton">Edward Stourton, 10th Baron Stourton</a>, but Catesby proclaimed that "the innocent must perish with the guilty, sooner than ruin the chances of success." As the last few details were being finalised that month, on Saturday 26 October Monteagle received an anonymous letter while at his house in <a href="Hoxton">Hoxton</a>. It contained the following message:

Uncertain of its meaning, Monteagle delivered it to the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20%28England%29">English Secretary of State</a>, <a href="Robert%20Cecil%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Salisbury">Robert Cecil</a>.

Tresham has long been suspected as the letter's author. Mark Nicholls states that he almost certainly wrote it, pointing to the fact that once Catesby was made aware of its existence he immediately suspected Tresham and went with Thomas Wintour to confront him. The two threatened to "hang him", but "with such oaths and emphatic assertions" Tresham managed to convince the pair of his innocence, the next day urging them by letter to abandon the plot. Antonia Fraser suggests that Catesby and Wintour's decision to believe him should not be disregarded. While making his deathbed confession in the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>, Tresham failed to mention the letter; an omission which in her opinion makes no sense if he is to be regarded as its author, especially considering that its recipient was by then being credited as the country's saviour. Author Alan Haynes views Tresham as the most likely culprit, but raises the possibility that Cecil penned the letter himself, to protect a source.

Although he was already aware of certain stirrings even before he received the letter, Cecil did not yet know the exact nature of the plot or who was involved and had elected to watch to see what would happen. When Monteagle's letter was shown to the king on Friday 1 November, James felt that it hinted at "some strategem of fire and powder", perhaps an explosion exceeding in violence the one that killed his father, <a href="Henry%20Stuart%2C%20Lord%20Darnley">Lord Darnley</a>, in 1567. The following day, members of the Privy Council visited James to inform him that a search would be made of the Houses of Parliament, "both above and below". Meanwhile, Tresham again urged Catesby and Wintour to abandon the scheme, but his attempts were in vain. Fellow plotter <a href="Thomas%20Percy%20%28Gunpowder%20Plot%29">Thomas Percy</a> said he was ready to "abide the uttermost trial", and subsequently on 4 November Catesby and several others left London for the Midlands to prepare for the planned uprising.

Fawkes was arrested while guarding the explosives shortly after midnight on 5 November 1605. Calling himself John Johnson, he was at first interrogated by members of the King's Privy Chamber, but on 6 November James ordered that "John Johnson" be tortured. His will finally broken, he revealed his true identity on 7 November, and on 8 November he began to name some of those with whom he was associated. Tresham's complicity was not revealed until the following day, although he was attributed with only a minor role. But while his compatriots had fled London the moment they discovered that Fawkes had been captured, Tresham had stayed in the city. He was arrested on 12 November and transferred to the Tower three days later. Catesby and several other plotters were killed on 8 November, during an armed siege at <a href="Holbeche%20House">Holbeche House</a> in <a href="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a>.

Although at first he was uncooperative, on 13 November Tresham confessed to being involved in the plot, outlining his version of events to his interrogators. Moving his family from the safety of Rushton was, he pointed out, not the action of a man who believed he was taking them into "the very mouth and fury" of the plot. He admitted to the government that he was guilty only of the plot's concealment, denying that he had ever been an active member of the conspiracy, although by the end of the month he had also admitted his involvement in the Spanish Treason of 1602–1603. He claimed to have persuaded Thomas Wintour and Thomas Percy to postpone the explosion, and that he had planned to inform the king's secretary Thomas Lake of a "Puritan conspiracy". Fraser views much of his confession as "highly partial ... not only for his own sake but for that of his wife and children", and important in serving to highlight his unreliability.

Tresham suffered from a <a href="strangury">strangury</a> caused by an inflammation of his urinary tract, and in December 1605 his health began to decline. Lieutenant of the Tower <a href="William%20Waad">William Waad</a>, wondering if Tresham would live long enough for justice to take its course, described his condition as "worse and worse". Tresham preferred the services of a Dr Richard Foster over those of the Tower's regular doctor <a href="Matthew%20Gwinne">Matthew Gwinne</a>; apparently Foster understood his case, indicating that it was not the first occasion on which he had treated him. During his last days he was attended by three more doctors and a nurse, along with William Vavasour, a rumoured illegitimate child of Thomas Tresham and possibly Francis's half-brother. As Tresham's wife, Anne, was apparently too upset, Vavasour wrote Tresham's deathbed confession and also an account of his last hours. Tresham apologised to the Jesuit priest <a href="Henry%20Garnet">Henry Garnet</a> for implicating him in the Spanish Treason, and used the rest of his deathbed confession to protest his innocence. Anne and William read prayers at his bedside; he died at 2:00 am on 23 December. Despite not being tried, his head joined those of Catesby and Percy on display at Northampton, while his body was thrown into a hole at <a href="Tower%20Hill">Tower Hill</a>. His estates passed to his brother Lewis. Tresham's apology never reached its intended target, and his letter, along with the discovery of Garnet's "Of Equivocation", found among the "heretical, treasonable and damnable books" at Tresham's chamber in the <a href="Inner%20Temple">Inner Temple</a>, was used to great effect by Sir <a href="Edward%20Coke">Edward Coke</a> in Garnet's trial. The priest was executed in May 1606.

Reactive attachment disorder

Reactive attachment disorder (RAD) is described in clinical literature as a severe and relatively uncommon <a href="attachment%20disorder">disorder</a> that can affect children. RAD is characterized by markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate ways of relating socially in most contexts. It can take the form of a persistent failure to initiate or respond to most social interactions in a developmentally appropriate way—known as the "inhibited form". Due to recent revision in the <a href="DSM-5">DSM-5</a> the "disinhibited form" is now considered a separate diagnosis named "<a href="disinhibited%20attachment%20disorder">disinhibited attachment disorder</a>".

RAD arises from a failure to form normal attachments to primary caregivers in early childhood. Such a failure could result from severe early experiences of <a href="neglect">neglect</a>, <a href="abuse">abuse</a>, abrupt separation from caregivers between the ages of six months and three years, frequent change of caregivers, or a lack of caregiver responsiveness to a child's communicative efforts. Not all, or even a majority of such experiences, result in the disorder. It is differentiated from <a href="pervasive%20developmental%20disorder">pervasive developmental disorder</a> or developmental delay and from possibly <a href="comorbidity">comorbid</a> conditions such as <a href="intellectual%20disability">intellectual disability</a>, all of which can affect attachment behavior. The criteria for a diagnosis of a reactive attachment "disorder" are very different from the criteria used in assessment or categorization of <a href="Attachment%20theory%23Attachment%20patterns">attachment "styles"</a> such as insecure or disorganized attachment.

Children with RAD are presumed to have grossly disturbed internal working models of relationships that may lead to interpersonal and behavioral difficulties in later life. There are few studies of long-term effects, and there is a lack of clarity about the presentation of the disorder beyond the age of five years. However, the opening of orphanages in Eastern Europe following the end of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> in the early-1990s provided opportunities for research on infants and toddlers brought up in very deprived conditions. Such research broadened the understanding of the prevalence, causes, mechanism and assessment of disorders of attachment and led to efforts from the late-1990s onwards to develop treatment and prevention programs and better methods of assessment. Mainstream theorists in the field have proposed that a broader range of conditions arising from problems with attachment should be defined beyond current classifications.

Mainstream treatment and prevention programs that target RAD and other problematic early attachment behaviors are based on <a href="attachment%20theory">attachment theory</a> and concentrate on increasing the responsiveness and sensitivity of the caregiver, or if that is not possible, placing the child with a different caregiver. Most such strategies are in the process of being evaluated. Mainstream practitioners and theorists have presented significant criticism of the diagnosis and treatment of alleged reactive attachment disorder or the theoretically baseless "attachment disorder" within the controversial form of psychotherapy commonly known as <a href="attachment%20therapy">attachment therapy</a>. Attachment therapy has a scientifically unsupported theoretical base and uses diagnostic criteria or symptom lists markedly different to criteria under ICD-10 or DSM-IV-TR, or to attachment behaviors. A range of treatment approaches are used in attachment "therapy", some of which are physically and psychologically coercive, and considered to be <a href="wikt%3A%20antithetical">antithetical</a> to attachment "theory". Many constitute <a href="child%20abuse">abuse</a>.

<a href="Pediatricians">Pediatricians</a> are often the first health professionals to assess and raise suspicions of RAD in children with the disorder. The initial presentation varies according to the child's developmental and chronological age, although it always involves a disturbance in social interaction. <a href="Infant">Infant</a>s up to about 18–24 months "may" present with <a href="Failure%20to%20thrive">non-organic failure to thrive</a> and display abnormal responsiveness to stimuli. Laboratory investigations will be unremarkable barring possible findings consistent with <a href="malnutrition">malnutrition</a> or <a href="dehydration">dehydration</a>, while serum <a href="growth%20hormone">growth hormone</a> levels will be normal or elevated.

The core feature is severely inappropriate social relating by affected children. This can manifest itself in three ways:


While RAD occurs in relation to neglectful and abusive treatment, automatic diagnoses on this basis alone cannot be made, as children can form stable attachments and social relationships despite marked abuse and neglect. However, the instances of that ability are rare.

The name of the disorder emphasizes problems with attachment but the criteria includes symptoms such as failure to thrive, a lack of developmentally appropriate social responsiveness, apathy, and onset before 8 months.

There is as yet no universally accepted diagnostic protocol for reactive attachment disorder. Often a range of measures is used in research and diagnosis. Recognized assessment methods of attachment styles, difficulties or disorders include the Strange Situation Procedure (devised by <a href="developmental%20psychology">developmental psychologist</a> <a href="Mary%20Ainsworth">Mary Ainsworth</a>), the separation and reunion procedure and the Preschool Assessment of Attachment, the Observational Record of the Caregiving Environment, the <a href="Attachment%20measures%23Developing%20methods%20for%20older%20toddlers%20and%20children">Attachment Q-sort</a> and a variety of narrative techniques using <a href="attachment%20measures%23Other%20approaches">stem stories</a>, puppets or pictures. For older children, actual interviews such as the <a href="Attachment%20measures%23Other%20approaches">Child Attachment Interview</a> and the Autobiographical Emotional Events Dialogue can be used. Caregivers may also be assessed using procedures such as the Working Model of the Child Interview.

More recent research also uses the <a href="Attachment%20measures%23Developing%20methods%20for%20older%20toddlers%20and%20children">Disturbances of Attachment Interview</a> (DAI) developed by Smyke and <a href="Charles%20H.%20Zeanah">Zeanah</a> (1999). The DAI is a semi-structured interview designed to be administered by clinicians to caregivers. It covers 12 items, namely "having a discriminated, preferred adult", "seeking comfort when distressed", "responding to comfort when offered", "social and emotional reciprocity", "emotional regulation", "checking back after venturing away from the care giver", "reticence with unfamiliar adults", "willingness to go off with relative strangers", "self-endangering behavior", "excessive clinging", "vigilance/hypercompliance" and "role reversal". This method is designed to pick up not only RAD but also the proposed new alternative categories of disorders of attachment.

Although increasing numbers of childhood mental health problems are being attributed to <a href="genetic%20defect">genetic defect</a>s, reactive attachment disorder is by definition based on a problematic history of care and social relationships. Abuse can occur alongside the required factors, but on its own does not explain attachment disorder. It has been suggested that types of <a href="temperament">temperament</a>, or constitutional response to the environment, may make some individuals susceptible to the stress of unpredictable or hostile relationships with caregivers in the early years. In the absence of available and responsive caregivers it appears that most children are particularly vulnerable to developing attachment disorders.

While similar abnormal parenting may produce the two distinct forms of the disorder, inhibited and disinhibited, studies show that the abuse and neglect was far more prominent and severe in the cases of RAD, disinhibited type. The issue of temperament and its influence on the development of attachment disorders has yet to be resolved. RAD has never been reported in the absence of serious environmental adversity yet outcomes for children raised in the same environment are the same.

In discussing the <a href="Neurobiology">neurobiological</a> basis for attachment and trauma symptoms in a seven-year <a href="twin%20study">twin study</a>, it has been suggested that the roots of various forms of <a href="psychopathology">psychopathology</a>, including RAD, <a href="Borderline%20Personality%20Disorder">Borderline Personality Disorder</a> (BPD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), can be found in disturbances in <a href="Affect%20%28psychology%29">affect</a> regulation. The subsequent development of higher-order <a href="Emotional%20dysregulation">self-regulation</a> is jeopardized and the formation of internal models is affected. Consequently, the "templates" in the mind that drive organized behavior in relationships may be impacted. The potential for "re-regulation" (modulation of emotional responses to within the normal range) in the presence of "corrective" experiences (normative caregiving) seems possible.

RAD is one of the least researched and most poorly understood disorders in the DSM. There is little systematic epidemiologic information on RAD, its course is not well established and it appears difficult to diagnose accurately. There is a lack of clarity about the presentation of attachment disorders over the age of five years and difficulty in distinguishing between aspects of attachment disorders, disorganized attachment or the consequences of maltreatment.

According to the <a href="American%20Academy%20of%20Child%20and%20Adolescent%20Psychiatry">American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</a> (AACAP), children who exhibit signs of reactive attachment disorder need a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and individualized treatment plan. The signs or symptoms of RAD may also be found in other psychiatric disorders and AACAP advises against giving a child this label or diagnosis without a comprehensive evaluation. Their practice parameter states that the assessment of reactive attachment disorder requires evidence directly obtained from serial observations of the child interacting with his or her primary caregivers and history (as available) of the child’s patterns of attachment behavior with these caregivers. It also requires observations of the child’s behavior with unfamiliar adults and a comprehensive history of the child’s early caregiving environment including, for example, pediatricians, teachers, or caseworkers. In the US, initial evaluations may be conducted by psychologists, psychiatrists, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists, Licensed Professional Counselors, specialist Licensed Clinical Social Workers or psychiatric nurses.

In the UK, the <a href="British%20Association%20for%20Adoption%20and%20Fostering">British Association for Adoption and Fostering</a> (BAAF) advise that only a psychiatrist can diagnose an attachment disorder and that any assessment must include a comprehensive evaluation of the child’s individual and family history.

According to the AACAP Practice Parameter (2005) the question of whether attachment disorders can reliably be diagnosed in older children and adults has not been resolved. Attachment behaviors used for the diagnosis of RAD change markedly with development and defining analogous behaviors in older children is difficult. There are no substantially validated measures of attachment in middle childhood or early adolescence. Assessments of RAD past school age may not be possible at all as by this time children have developed along individual lines to such an extent that early attachment experiences are only one factor among many that determine emotion and behavior.

ICD-10 describes reactive attachment disorder of childhood, known as RAD, and <a href="disinhibited%20attachment%20disorder">disinhibited attachment disorder</a>, less well known as DAD. DSM-IV-TR also describes reactive attachment disorder of infancy or early childhood divided into two subtypes, inhibited type and disinhibited type, both known as RAD. The two classifications are similar and both include:

ICD-10 states in relation to the inhibited form only that the syndrome probably occurs as a direct result of severe parental neglect, abuse, or serious mishandling. DSM states in relation to both forms there must be a history of "<a href="pathogenic">pathogenic</a> care" defined as persistent disregard of the child's basic emotional or physical needs or repeated changes in primary caregiver that prevents the formation of a discriminatory or selective attachment that is presumed to account for the disorder. For this reason, part of the <a href="medical%20diagnosis">diagnosis</a> is the child's history of care rather than observation of symptoms.

In DSM-IV-TR the "inhibited" form is described as persistent failure to initiate or respond in a developmentally appropriate fashion to most social interactions, as manifest by excessively inhibited, hypervigilant, or highly ambivalent and contradictory responses (e.g., the child may respond to caregivers with a mixture of approach, avoidance, and resistance to comforting or may exhibit "frozen watchfulness", hypervigilance while keeping an impassive and still demeanour). Such infants do not seek or accept comfort at times of threat, alarm or distress, thus failing to maintain "proximity", an essential element of attachment behavior. The "disinhibited" form shows diffuse attachments as manifest by indiscriminate sociability with marked inability to exhibit appropriate selective attachments (e.g., excessive familiarity with relative strangers or lack of selectivity in choice of attachment figures). There is therefore a lack of "specificity" of attachment figure, the second basic element of attachment behavior.

The ICD-10 descriptions are comparable save that ICD-10 includes in its description several elements not included in DSM-IV-TR as follows:

The first of these is somewhat controversial, being a commission rather than omission and because abuse in and of itself does not lead to attachment disorder.

The inhibited form has a greater tendency to ameliorate with an appropriate caregiver, while the disinhibited form is more enduring. ICD-10 states the disinhibited form "tends to persist despite marked changes in environmental circumstances". Disinhibited and inhibited are not opposites in terms of attachment disorder and can coexist in the same child. The question of whether there are two subtypes has been raised. The World Health Organization acknowledges that there is uncertainty regarding the diagnostic criteria and the appropriate subdivision. One reviewer has commented on the difficulty of clarifying the core characteristics of and differences between atypical attachment styles and ways of categorizing more severe disorders of attachment.

, the American Psychiatric Association has proposed to redefine RAD into two distinct disorders in the DSM-V. Corresponding with the inhibited type, one disorder will be reclassified as "Reactive Attachment Disorder of Infancy and Early Childhood".

In regards to pathogenic care, or the type of care in which these behaviors are present, a new criterion for Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder now includes chronically harsh punishment or other types of severely inept caregiving. Relating to pathogenic care for both proposed disorders, a new criterion is rearing in atypical environments such as institutions with high child/caregiver ratios that cut down on opportunities to form attachments with a caregiver.

The diagnostic complexities of RAD mean that careful diagnostic evaluation by a trained <a href="mental%20health">mental health</a> expert with particular expertise in <a href="differential%20diagnosis">differential diagnosis</a> is considered essential. Several other disorders, such as <a href="conduct%20disorder">conduct disorder</a>s, <a href="oppositional%20defiant%20disorder">oppositional defiant disorder</a>, <a href="anxiety%20disorder">anxiety disorder</a>s, <a href="post%20traumatic%20stress%20disorder">post traumatic stress disorder</a> and <a href="social%20anxiety%20disorder">social phobia</a> share many symptoms and are often comorbid with or confused with RAD, leading to over and under diagnosis. RAD can also be confused with neuropsychiatric disorders such as <a href="autism%20spectrum">autism</a>, <a href="pervasive%20developmental%20disorder">pervasive developmental disorder</a>, <a href="pediatric%20schizophrenia">childhood schizophrenia</a> and some genetic syndromes. Infants with this disorder can be distinguished from those with organic illness by their rapid physical improvement after hospitalization. Autistic children are likely to be of normal size and weight and often exhibit a degree of intellectual disability. They are unlikely to improve upon being removed from the home.

In the absence of a standardized diagnosis system, many popular, informal classification systems or checklists, outside the <a href="Diagnostic%20and%20Statistical%20Manual%20of%20Mental%20Disorders">DSM</a> and <a href="ICD">ICD</a>, were created out of clinical and parental experience within the field known as <a href="attachment%20therapy">attachment therapy</a>. These lists are unvalidated and critics state they are inaccurate, too broadly defined or applied by unqualified persons. Many are found on the websites of attachment therapists. Common elements of these lists such as lying, lack of remorse or conscience and cruelty do not form part of the diagnostic criteria under either DSM-IV-TR or ICD-10. Many children are being diagnosed with RAD because of behavioral problems that are outside the criteria. There is an emphasis within attachment therapy on aggressive behavior as a symptom of what they describe as attachment disorder whereas mainstream theorists view these behaviors as comorbid, <a href="Externalization">externalizing</a> behaviors requiring appropriate assessment and treatment rather than attachment disorders. However, knowledge of attachment relationships can contribute to the cause, maintenance and treatment of externalizing disorders.

The Randolph Attachment Disorder Questionnaire or RADQ is one of the better known of these checklists and is used by attachment therapists and others. The checklist includes 93 discrete behaviours, many of which either overlap with other disorders, like conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder, or are not related to attachment difficulties. Critics assert that it is unvalidated and lacks <a href="Specificity%20%28tests%29">specificity</a>.

Assessing the child's safety is an essential first step that determines whether future intervention can take place in the family unit or whether the child should be removed to a safe situation. Interventions may include psychosocial support services for the family unit (including financial or domestic aid, housing and social work support), psychotherapeutic interventions (including treating parents for mental illness, <a href="family%20therapy">family therapy</a>, individual therapy), education (including training in basic parenting skills and child development), and monitoring of the child's safety within the family environment

In 2005 the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry laid down guidelines (devised by N.W. Boris and C.H. Zeanah) based on its published parameters for the diagnosis and treatment of RAD. Recommendations in the guidelines include the following:

Mainstream prevention programs and treatment approaches for attachment difficulties or disorders for infants and younger children are based on attachment theory and concentrate on increasing the responsiveness and sensitivity of the caregiver, or if that is not possible, placing the child with a different caregiver. These approaches are mostly in the process of being evaluated. The programs invariably include a detailed assessment of the attachment status or caregiving responses of the adult caregiver as attachment is a two-way process involving attachment behavior and caregiver response. Some of these treatment or prevention programs are specifically aimed at foster carers rather than parents, as the attachment behaviors of infants or children with attachment difficulties often do not elicit appropriate caregiver responses. Approaches include "Watch, wait and wonder," manipulation of sensitive responsiveness, modified "Interaction Guidance", "Clinician-Assisted Videofeedback Exposure Sessions (CAVES)", "Preschool Parent Psychotherapy", "Circle of Security", "Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up" (ABC), the New Orleans Intervention, and parent–child psychotherapy. Other treatment methods include Developmental, Individual-difference, and Relationship-based therapy (DIR, also referred to as Floor Time) by <a href="Stanley%20Greenspan">Stanley Greenspan</a>, although DIR is primarily directed to treatment of pervasive developmental disorders.

The relevance of these approaches to intervention with fostered and adopted children with RAD or older children with significant histories of maltreatment is unclear.

The terms <a href="attachment%20disorder">attachment disorder</a>, attachment problems, and attachment therapy, although increasingly used, have no clear, specific, or consensus definitions. However, the terms and therapies often are applied to children who are maltreated, particularly those in the foster care, kinship care, or adoption systems, and related populations such as children adopted internationally from orphanages.

Outside the mainstream programs is a <a href="Attachment%20therapy%23Treatment%20characteristics">form of treatment</a> generally known as attachment therapy, a subset of techniques (and accompanying novel diagnosis) for supposed attachment disorders including RAD. These "attachment disorders" use diagnostic criteria or symptom lists different to criteria under ICD-10 or DSM-IV-TR, or to attachment behaviors. Sufferers of "attachment disorder" are said to lack empathy and remorse.

Treatments of this pseudoscientific disorder are called "Attachment therapy". In general, these therapies are aimed at adopted or fostered children with a view to creating attachment in these children to their new caregivers. The theoretical base is broadly a combination of <a href="Age%20regression%20in%20therapy">regression</a> and <a href="catharsis">catharsis</a>, accompanied by parenting methods which emphasize <a href="Obedience%20%28human%20behavior%29">obedience</a> and parental control. There is considerable criticism of this form of treatment and diagnosis as it is largely unvalidated and has developed outside the scientific mainstream. There is little or no <a href="Evidence%20based%20medicine">evidence base</a> and techniques vary from non-coercive <a href="Therapy">therapeutic</a> work to more extreme forms of physical, confrontational and coercive techniques, of which the best known are <a href="holding%20therapy">holding therapy</a>, <a href="Rebirthing%20%28attachment%20therapy%29">rebirthing</a>, <a href="rage-reduction">rage-reduction</a> and the <a href="Evergreen%20model">Evergreen model</a>. These forms of the therapy may well involve physical restraint, the deliberate provocation of rage and anger in the child by physical and verbal means including deep tissue massage, aversive tickling, enforced eye contact and verbal confrontation, and being pushed to revisit earlier trauma. Critics maintain that these therapies are not within the attachment paradigm, are potentially abusive, and are <a href="wikt%3A%20antithetical">antithetical</a> to attachment theory. The <a href="American%20Professional%20Society%20on%20the%20Abuse%20of%20Children">APSAC</a> Taskforce Report of 2006 notes that many of these therapies concentrate on changing the child rather than the caregiver. Children may be described as "RADs", "Radkids" or "Radishes" and dire predictions may be made as to their supposedly violent futures if they are not treated with attachment therapy. The Mayo Clinic, a well known U.S. non-profit medical practice and medical research group, cautions against consulting with mental health providers who promote these types of methods and offer evidence to support their techniques; to date, this evidence base is not published within reputable medical or mental health journals.

The AACAP guidelines state that children with reactive attachment disorder are presumed to have grossly disturbed internal models for relating to others. However, the course of RAD is not well studied and there have been few efforts to examine symptom patterns over time. The few existing <a href="longitudinal%20study">longitudinal studies</a> (dealing with developmental change with age over a period of time) involve only children from poorly run Eastern European institutions.

Findings from the studies of children from Eastern European orphanages indicate that persistence of the inhibited pattern of RAD is rare in children adopted out of institutions into normative care-giving environments. However, there is a close association between duration of deprivation and severity of attachment disorder behaviors. The quality of attachments that these children form with subsequent care-givers may be compromised, but they probably no longer meet criteria for inhibited RAD. The same group of studies suggests that a minority of adopted, institutionalized children exhibit persistent indiscriminate sociability even after more normative caregiving environments are provided. Indiscriminate sociability may persist for years, even among children who subsequently exhibit preferred attachment to their new caregivers. Some exhibit <a href="hyperactivity">hyperactivity</a> and attention problems as well as difficulties in peer relationships. In the only longitudinal study that has followed children with indiscriminate behavior into adolescence, these children were significantly more likely to exhibit poor peer relationships.

Studies of children who were reared in institutions have suggested that they are inattentive and overactive, no matter what quality of care they received. In one investigation, some institution-reared boys were reported to be inattentive, overactive, and markedly unselective in their social relationships, while girls, foster-reared children, and some institution-reared children were not. It is not yet clear whether these behaviors should be considered as part of disordered attachment.

There is one case study on maltreated twins published in 1999 with a follow-up in 2006. This study assessed the twins between the ages of 19 and 36 months, during which time they suffered multiple moves and placements. The paper explores the similarities, differences and comorbidity of RAD, disorganized attachment and post traumatic stress disorder. The girl showed signs of the inhibited form of RAD while the boy showed signs of the indiscriminate form. It was noted that the diagnosis of RAD ameliorated with better care but symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder and signs of disorganized attachment came and went as the infants progressed through multiple placement changes. At age three, some lasting relationship disturbance was evident.

In the follow-up case study when the twins were aged three and eight years, the lack of longitudinal research on maltreated as opposed to institutionalized children was again highlighted. The girl's symptoms of disorganized attachment had developed into controlling behaviors—a well-documented outcome. The boy still exhibited self-endangering behaviors, not within RAD criteria but possibly within "secure base distortion", (where the child has a preferred familiar caregiver, but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment). At age eight the children were assessed with a variety of measures including those designed to access representational systems, or the child's "internal working models". The twins' symptoms were indicative of different trajectories. The girl showed externalizing symptoms (particularly deceit), contradictory reports of current functioning, chaotic personal narratives, struggles with friendships, and emotional disengagement with her caregiver, resulting in a clinical picture described as "quite concerning". The boy still evidenced self-endangering behaviors as well as avoidance in relationships and emotional expression, separation anxiety and impulsivity and attention difficulties. It was apparent that life stressors had impacted each child differently. The <a href="Attachment%20measures%23Other%20approaches">narrative measures</a> used were considered helpful in tracking how early attachment disruption is associated with later expectations about relationships.

One paper using questionnaires found that children aged three to six, diagnosed with RAD, scored lower on empathy but higher on <a href="Self%20monitoring">self-monitoring</a> (regulating your behavior to "look good"). These differences were especially pronounced based on ratings by parents, and suggested that children with RAD may systematically report their personality traits in overly positive ways. Their scores also indicated considerably more behavioral problems than scores of the control children.

Epidemiological data are limited, but reactive attachment disorder appears to be very uncommon. The <a href="prevalence">prevalence</a> of RAD is unclear but it is probably quite rare, other than in populations of children being reared in the most extreme, deprived settings such as some orphanages. There is little systematically gathered <a href="epidemiology">epidemiologic</a> information on RAD. A cohort study of 211 Copenhagen children to the age of 18 months found a prevalence of 0.9%.

Attachment disorders tend to occur in a definable set of contexts such as within some types of institutions, in the presence of repeated changes of primary caregiver or of extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, but not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder. Studies undertaken on children from Eastern European orphanages from the mid-1990s showed significantly higher levels of both forms of RAD and of insecure patterns of attachment in the institutionalized children, regardless of how long they had been there. It would appear that children in institutions like these are unable to form selective attachments to their caregivers. The difference between the institutionalized children and the control group had lessened in the follow-up study three years later, although the institutionalized children continued to show significantly higher levels of indiscriminate friendliness. However, even among children raised in the most deprived institutional conditions the majority did not show symptoms of this disorder.

A 2002 study of children in residential nurseries in <a href="Bucharest">Bucharest</a>, in which the DAI was used, challenged the current DSM and ICD conceptualizations of disordered attachment and showed that inhibited and disinhibited disorders could coexist in the same child.

There are two studies on the incidence of RAD relating to high risk and maltreated children in the U.S. Both used ICD, DSM and the DAI. The first, in 2004, reported that children from the maltreatment sample were significantly more likely to meet criteria for one or more attachment disorders than children from the other groups, however this was mainly the proposed new classification of disrupted attachment disorder rather than the DSM or ICD classified RAD or DAD. The second study, also in 2004, attempted to ascertain the prevalence of RAD and whether it could be reliably identified in "maltreated" rather than "neglected" toddlers. Of the 94 maltreated toddlers in foster care, 35% were identified as having ICD RAD and 22% as having ICD DAD, and 38% fulfilled the DSM criteria for RAD. This study found that RAD could be reliably identified and also that the inhibited and disinhibited forms were not independent. However, there are some methodological concerns with this study. A number of the children identified as fulfilling the criteria for RAD did in fact have a preferred attachment figure.

It has been suggested by some within the field of attachment therapy that RAD may be quite prevalent because severe child maltreatment, which is known to increase risk for RAD, is prevalent and because children who are severely abused may exhibit behaviors similar to RAD behaviors. The APSAC Taskforce consider this inference to be flawed and questionable. Severely abused children may exhibit similar behaviors to RAD behaviors but there are several far more common and demonstrably treatable diagnoses which may better account for these difficulties. Further, many children experience severe maltreatment and do not develop clinical disorders. <a href="Psychological%20resilience">Resilience</a> is a common and normal human characteristic. RAD does not underlie all or even most of the behavioral and emotional problems seen in <a href="foster%20care">foster children</a>, <a href="adoption">adoptive children</a>, or children who are maltreated and rates of child abuse and/or neglect or problem behaviors are not a benchmark for estimates of RAD.

There are few data on comorbid conditions, but there are some conditions that arise in the same circumstances in which RAD arises, such as institutionalization or maltreatment. These are principally developmental delays and language disorders associated with neglect. Conduct disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and social phobia share many symptoms and are often comorbid with or confused with RAD. Attachment disorder behaviors amongst institutionalized children are correlated with attentional and conduct problems and cognitive levels but nonetheless appear to index a distinct set of symptoms and behaviors.

Reactive attachment disorder first made its appearance in standard <a href="nosology">nosologies</a> of psychological disorders in DSM-III, 1980, following an accumulation of evidence on institutionalized children. The criteria included a requirement of onset before the age of 8 months and was equated with <a href="failure%20to%20thrive">failure to thrive</a>. Both these features were dropped in DSM-III-R, 1987. Instead, onset was changed to being within the first 5 years of life and the disorder itself was divided into two subcategories, inhibited and disinhibited. These changes resulted from further research on maltreated and institutionalized children and remain in the current version, DSM-IV, 1994, and its 2000 text revision, DSM-IV-TR, as well as in ICD-10, 1992. Both nosologies focus on young children who are not merely at increased risk for subsequent disorders but are already exhibiting clinical disturbance.

The broad theoretical framework for current versions of RAD is <a href="attachment%20theory">attachment theory</a>, based on work conducted from the 1940s to the 1980s by <a href="John%20Bowlby">John Bowlby</a>, <a href="Mary%20Ainsworth">Mary Ainsworth</a> and <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Spitz">René Spitz</a>. Attachment theory is a framework that employs <a href="Psychology">psychological</a>, <a href="Ethology">ethological</a> and <a href="Evolutionary%20psychology">evolutionary</a> concepts to explain social behaviors typical of young children. Attachment theory focuses on the tendency of infants or children to "seek proximity" to a "particular attachment figure" (familiar caregiver), in situations of alarm or distress, behavior which appears to have survival value. This is known as a discriminatory or selective attachment. Subsequently, the child begins to use the caregiver as a base of security from which to explore the environment, returning periodically to the familiar person. Attachment is not the same as love and/or affection although they are often associated. Attachment and attachment <a href="Human%20behavior">behaviors</a> tend to develop between the ages of six months and three years. <a href="Attachment%20in%20children">Infants become attached to adults</a> who are sensitive and responsive in social interactions with the infant, and who remain as consistent caregivers for some time. Caregiver responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment, that in turn lead to internal working models which will guide the individual's feelings, thoughts, and expectations in later relationships. For a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder, the child's history and atypical social behavior must suggest the absence of formation of a discriminatory or selective attachment.

The pathological absence of a discriminatory or selective attachment needs to be differentiated from the existence of attachments with either typical or somewhat atypical behavior patterns, known as "styles" or "patterns". There are four attachment <a href="Attachment%20in%20children%23Attachment%20patterns">styles</a> ascertained and used within developmental attachment research. These are known as "secure", "anxious-ambivalent", "anxious-avoidant", (all "organized") and "disorganized". The latter three are characterised as "insecure". These are assessed using the <a href="Attachment%20measures%23Measuring%20attachment%20in%20children">Strange Situation Procedure</a>, designed to assess the quality of attachments rather than whether an attachment exists at all.

A securely attached toddler will explore freely while the caregiver is present, engage with strangers, be visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and happy to see the caregiver return. The anxious-ambivalent toddler is anxious of exploration, extremely distressed when the caregiver departs but ambivalent when the caregiver returns. The anxious-avoidant toddler will not explore much, avoid or ignore the parent—showing little emotion when the parent departs or returns—and treat strangers much the same as caregivers with little emotional range shown. The disorganized/disoriented toddler shows a lack of a coherent style or pattern for coping. Evidence suggests this occurs when the caregiving figure is also an object of fear, thus putting the child in an irresolvable situation regarding approach and avoidance. On reunion with the caregiver, these children can look dazed or frightened, freezing in place, backing toward the caregiver or approaching with head sharply averted, or showing other behaviors implying fear of the person who is being sought. It is thought to represent a breakdown of an inchoate attachment strategy and it appears to affect the capacity to regulate emotions.

Although there are a wide range of attachment difficulties within the styles which may result in emotional disturbance and increase the risk of later psychopathologies, particularly the disorganized style, none of the styles constitute a disorder in themselves and none equate to criteria for RAD as such. A <a href="disease">disorder</a> in the <a href="Clinical%20psychology">clinical</a> sense is a condition requiring treatment, as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders. Reactive attachment disorder denotes a lack of typical attachment behaviors rather than an attachment style, however problematic that style may be, in that there is an unusual lack of discrimination between familiar and unfamiliar people in both forms of the disorder. Such discrimination does exist as a feature of the social behavior of children with atypical attachment styles. Both DSM-IV and ICD-10 depict the disorder in terms of socially aberrant behavior in general rather than focusing more specifically on attachment behaviors as such. DSM-IV emphasizes a failure to initiate or respond to social interactions across a range of relationships and ICD-10 similarly focuses on contradictory or ambivalent social responses that extend across social situations. The relationship between patterns of attachment in the Strange Situation and RAD is not yet clear.

There is a lack of consensus about the precise meaning of the term "attachment disorder". The term is frequently used both as an alternative to reactive attachment disorder and in discussions about different proposed classifications for disorders of attachment beyond the limitations of the ICD and DSM classifications. It is also used within the field of attachment therapy, as is the term reactive attachment disorder, to describe a range of problematic behaviors not within the ICD or DSM criteria or not related directly to attachment styles or difficulties at all.

Research from the late 1990s indicated there were disorders of attachment not captured by DSM or ICD and showed that RAD could be diagnosed reliably without evidence of pathogenic care, thus illustrating some of the conceptual difficulties with the rigid structure of the current definition of RAD. Research published in 2004 showed that the disinhibited form can endure alongside structured attachment behavior (of any style) towards the child's permanent caregivers.

Some authors have proposed a broader continuum of definitions of attachment disorders ranging from RAD through various attachment difficulties to the more problematic attachment styles. There is as yet no consensus, on this issue but a new set of practice parameters containing three categories of attachment disorder has been proposed by <a href="C.H.%20Zeanah">C.H. Zeanah</a> and N. Boris. The first of these is "disorder of attachment," in which a young child has no preferred adult caregiver. The proposed category of disordered attachment is parallel to RAD in its inhibited and disinhibited forms, as defined in DSM and ICD. The second category is "secure base distortion", where the child has a preferred familiar caregiver, but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment. Such children may endanger themselves, cling to the adult, be excessively compliant, or show role reversals in which they care for or punish the adult. The third type is "disrupted attachment". Disrupted attachment is not covered under ICD-10 and DSM criteria, and results from an abrupt separation or loss of a familiar caregiver to whom attachment has developed. This form of categorisation may demonstrate more clinical accuracy overall than the current DSM-IV-TR classification, but further research is required. The practice parameters would also provide the framework for a diagnostic protocol. Most recently, <a href="Daniel%20Schechter">Daniel Schechter</a> and Erica Willheim have shown a relationship between some maternal violence-related <a href="posttraumatic%20stress%20disorder">posttraumatic stress disorder</a> and secure base distortion (see above) which is characterized by child recklessness, separation anxiety, hypervigilance, and role-reversal.

Some research indicates there may be a significant overlap between behaviors of the inhibited form of RAD or DAD and aspects of disorganized attachment where there is an identified attachment figure.

An ongoing question is whether RAD should be thought of as a disorder of the child's personality or a distortion of the relationship between the child and a specific other person. It has been noted that as attachment disorders are by their very nature relational disorders, they do not fit comfortably into nosologies that characterize the disorder as centered on the person. Work by C.H. Zeanah indicates that atypical attachment-related behaviors may occur with one caregiver but not with another. This is similar to the situation reported for attachment styles, in which a particular parent's frightened expression has been considered as possibly responsible for disorganized/disoriented reunion behavior during the Strange Situation Procedure.

The draft of the proposed DSM-V suggests dividing RAD into two disorders, Reactive Attachment Disorder for the current inhibited form of RAD, and Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder for what is currently the disinhibited form of RAD, with some alterations in the proposed DSM definition.

Robin Friday

Robin Friday (27 July 1952 – 22 December 1990) was an English <a href="association%20football">footballer</a> who played professionally as a <a href="forward%20%28association%20football%29">forward</a> for <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a> and <a href="Cardiff%20City%20F.C.">Cardiff City</a> during a career that lasted four years in the mid-1970s. His on-field performances were regarded as excellent, and he won Reading's player of the year award in both of his full seasons there, as well as being the leading goal scorer. However, his habit of unsettling opponents through physical intimidation contributed to a heavily tarnished disciplinary record, and his personal life was one of heavy smoking, drinking, womanising and drug abuse. Despite his short career, he remains prominent in the memory of Reading and Cardiff supporters, both as a player and a personality. He has been voted Reading's best ever player three times.

Born and raised in <a href="Acton%2C%20London">Acton</a>, west London, Friday was scouted, but not retained, by four professional clubs during his teenage years. He appeared for local semi-professional sides in the <a href="Isthmian%20League">Isthmian League</a> until he joined <a href="Charlie%20Hurley">Charlie Hurley</a>'s <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a> Reading team in 1974—quickly becoming a key player, he helped Reading to win <a href="promotion%20and%20relegation">promotion</a> to the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> during the <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20Football%20League">1975–76</a> season. As his drug habit intensified, Friday's form began to dip in the first half of the <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20Football%20League">1976–77</a> season, leading Reading to sell him to <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> side Cardiff City around the New Year. Friday travelled to join his new team by train without a valid ticket and had to be bailed by the Cardiff manager <a href="Jimmy%20Andrews">Jimmy Andrews</a> before he signed for the club. He performed strongly on his debut, but afterwards his form declined and his personal life caused him to repeatedly miss matches altogether. Following a number of incidents, on and off the field—including kicking <a href="Mark%20Lawrenson">Mark Lawrenson</a> in the face —Friday retired from football in December 1977, aged 25. He died in Acton in 1990, aged 38, after suffering a heart attack.

The strongest aspects of Friday's game were his ball skills, footballing intelligence and physical and mental strength. Andrews labelled Friday "the complete centre-forward", and, along with numerous contemporaries, retrospectively rated Friday as good enough for the <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England national team</a>. In a 2004 <a href="BBC">BBC</a> poll, Friday was voted the top "all-time cult hero" for both Reading and Cardiff City. The Cardiff-based band <a href="Super%20Furry%20Animals">Super Furry Animals</a> dedicated their 1996 single "<a href="The%20Man%20Don%27t%20Give%20a%20Fuck">The Man Don't Give a Fuck</a>" to his memory.

Robin Friday and his twin brother, Tony, were born in <a href="Acton%2C%20London">Acton</a>, west London, on 27 July 1952. Their parents, Alf Friday, a driver for a laundry firm, and his wife Sheila, were both born in Acton and had married a year before, both aged 20, having met three years earlier. Sheila's father, Frederick Riding, had played professional football for <a href="Brentford%20F.C.">Brentford</a> before the Second World War. The Fridays lived with Sheila's family until moving into a <a href="Prefabricated%20home">prefab</a> of their own in <a href="Acton%20Green%2C%20London">Acton Green</a> when Robin and Tony were aged two; they moved to a <a href="Apartment%23Maisonette">maisonette</a> in <a href="South%20Acton%2C%20London">South Acton</a> in 1962 when it was found that the prefab was sinking. Robin and Tony were later described by their mother as having been remarkably close, rarely arguing or fighting. A noticeable difference in personality was that Robin was shy, whereas Tony was more confident. The twins attended their first professional match at the age of two, when their father took them to a Brentford match at <a href="Griffin%20Park">Griffin Park</a>. From the age of four Alf took both boys to play football at a local park every afternoon.

Around the age of ten, Friday possessed notable ball-skills, and according to his father could flick an orange up onto his neck, balance it and then let it roll it back down his body and catch it on his foot. As well as football, Robin played cricket to a high standard, boxed and played tennis. Despite their many similarities and common interest in sports and football in particular, the twins were wildly different in academic terms: while Tony did well at school, Friday was uninterested and according to his brother "was always <a href="wiktionary%3Abunk%23Etymology%203">bunking off</a>, having <a href="wiktionary%3Abird%23Etymology%201">birds</a> around the park".

Friday was scouted by numerous London sides during his teenage years, joining <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a>'s school of excellence at 12 or 13, then moving on to <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a> aged 13 and then to <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>, with whom he attended the <a href="1967%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1967 FA Cup Final</a>; as one of the club's youth players, he was part of the team's official party. However, Friday's individual style of play and refusal to change his game resulted in each of these clubs losing patience with him. The twin brothers joined a men's team, the Acton British Legion Reserves, aged 14, and in some matches would play alongside their father. Tony played in midfield, and Robin up front, but according to Tony his brother was better as a goalkeeper than a forward: "He was a brilliant goalkeeper. He had no fear ... But he obviously preferred banging them in at the other end". Around this time Robin became interested in music, dancing and attending concerts; he also had a talent for drawing, but suddenly abandoned this interest at 15. Robin became more outgoing than his brother and started taking drugs in his mid-teens. He left school at 15, a year before Tony, and began training as a plasterer.

Friday lasted two months as a plasterer before moving on to become first a van driver for a grocery firm, then a window cleaner. His laid-back attitude and indifference was already clear: in his father's words, "he didn't care". Friday regularly stole by this time, but despite numerous convictions, did not go to a detention centre until he was 16. Having been caught stealing what Tony recalled to be "a car radio or something", he was released almost immediately because he suffered from <a href="asthma">asthma</a>. However, after he re-offended three months later he was sent to <a href="HM%20Prison%20Feltham">Feltham</a> <a href="Borstal">Borstal</a> where he served 14 months. During his time there, Friday became stronger and fitter and also starred for the Borstal football team. He was selected for the prison league's all-star men's team, still aged 16, and allowed out of Borstal to train and play with <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a>'s youth team, for which he appeared three times in the <a href="South%20East%20Counties%20League">South East Counties League</a> during the 1968–69 season.

After his release, Friday returned to Acton, where he had a girlfriend called Maxine Doughan and a baby daughter called Nicola. Maxine was of <a href="Mixed%20%28United%20Kingdom%20ethnicity%20category%29">mixed race</a>. The local controversy surrounding the <a href="Interracial%20marriage">interracial relationship</a> caused the couple and their circle of friends to be socially isolated, and led to a physical attack on the group one night in an Acton <a href="public%20house">public house</a>. Despite this, and the opposition by both sets of parents—Alf refused to even attend the wedding—they married, both aged 17. Friday did not take his marital commitments seriously and continued to womanise, drink heavily and take narcotics. A friend who played for <a href="Walthamstow%20Avenue%20F.C.">Walthamstow Avenue</a>, a semi-professional <a href="Isthmian%20League">Isthmian League</a> club from north-east London, took Friday along to training one day in early 1971. Friday played well enough for Walthamstow to sign him the same day on wages of <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>10 per week. Many of his new teammates were <a href="asphalt">asphalt</a>ers from east London, and Friday soon joined them in that trade.

Friday made his debut for Walthamstow on 27 March 1971, against <a href="Bromley%20F.C.">Bromley</a>, coming off the bench to set up Walthamstow's equaliser. His first goal came on 17 April, when playing against <a href="Tooting%20%26amp%3B%20Mitcham%20United%20F.C.">Tooting & Mitcham</a> he once again appeared as a substitute and scored a header late in the game. He joined west London club <a href="Hayes%20F.C.">Hayes</a> in December 1971 after scoring twice against them in an Isthmian League match. Hayes offered £30 per week, and were also based closer to his home in Acton. A near-fatal accident at work in July 1972 caused Friday to undergo extensive surgery; while working on a roof in <a href="Lambeth">Lambeth</a>, a <a href="Hoist%20%28device%29">hoist</a> rope became stuck on the scaffold he was working on. The Hayes forward attempted to free the rope but fell and landed on a large spike: the spike went up through one of his buttocks, through his stomach and narrowly avoided a lung. Not only was Friday strong enough to pull himself off the spike, he recovered from his injuries within three months and returned to the Hayes team in October 1972.

Friday was known at Hayes for his excessive drinking, and on one occasion the team started a match a player short because Friday had not turned up. When he finally arrived, eighty minutes after kick-off, his intoxication was obvious, but he was still sent onto the pitch with the match still goalless. The opposition paid him little attention and Friday scored a late winning goal. Hayes were drawn to play <a href="The%20Football%20League">Football League</a> <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a> club Reading in the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>'s second round on 9 December 1972; the team managed to draw 0–0 at Reading and earn the right to a <a href="Replay%20%28sports%29">replay</a> at home, which they lost 1–0 three days later. Although Hayes had lost, the interest of Reading manager <a href="Charlie%20Hurley">Charlie Hurley</a> was piqued. Hurley travelled to Hayes more than once to watch Friday. Having researched the player's background, he was cautious about signing him, but was impressed all the same by his on-field performances.

The <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20in%20English%20football">1972–73</a> season was Friday's most prolific non-League year in terms of goals. He briefly joined <a href="Enfield%20F.C.">Enfield</a> early in the <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20in%20English%20football">1973–74</a> season and scored against Hayes in an FA Cup tie before returning to west London in December 1973. Having also been approached by <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> side <a href="Watford%20F.C.">Watford</a>, Friday signed for Hurley's Reading side in January 1974 for £750. He had scored 46 goals in 67 appearances for Hayes over his two spells there, but during his three Isthmian League seasons had been sent off seven times. Friday signed as an amateur, meaning that although he would be contracted to Reading he would be able to continue appearing for Hayes and working as an asphalter in London; he would train part-time with Reading and play for their reserve team.

In Hurley's words, Friday "trained like he played"; "he had no other way of playing". His new manager had to take him out of training on occasion because of the injuries he would inflict on his own teammates in his effort to win. By late January 1974, Reading were on a run of 14 games with only two victories, while Friday had performed strongly in three reserve matches. Hurley registered the amateur forward to play in the Football League on 23 January 1974 and gave him his first-team debut four days later. Friday turned in a performance against <a href="Northampton%20Town%20F.C.">Northampton Town</a> at <a href="Elm%20Park%20%28stadium%29">Elm Park</a> that the "<a href="Reading%20Post">Reading Evening Post</a>" called "outstanding" as Reading drew 3–3. The team then travelled to <a href="Barnsley%20F.C.">Barnsley</a> on 3 February, having not won away from home in four months. After Barnsley led 2–0 at half-time, Friday scored his first League goal with a header just after the break to make the score 2–1. Reading immediately offered a professional contract, which Friday signed on 6 February 1974. His new salary was half what he had earned as an asphalter.

Friday's technical ability made him very popular among Reading supporters and pressmen alike. The "Reading Evening Post" report of Reading's 4–1 victory over <a href="Exeter%20City%20F.C.">Exeter City</a> on 10 February 1974, Friday's first match as a professional, described his performance as "sheer magic" as he scored twice. The report also called Friday's first goal of the day "glorious": he collected the ball wide on the left wing, took it past four Exeter defenders and then fired the ball low and hard into the opposite corner from the edge of the penalty area. Friday was conspicuous in the professional ranks for never wearing <a href="Shin%20guard">shin pads</a>, and for his resistance to physical harm; no matter how badly he was hurt he would always get up and continue.

After sustaining a calf injury against Exeter, he returned for the team's next game, away at <a href="Lincoln%20City%20F.C.">Lincoln City</a> on 17 February. Friday was repeatedly and cynically fouled by the opposing players and sustained injuries necessitating five minutes on the sideline late in the first half. However, he recovered, returned to the game and set up both Reading goals as his side prevailed by a score of two goals to nil. The team's next game, on 24 February 1974, was at home against <a href="Doncaster%20Rovers%20F.C.">Doncaster Rovers</a>, and with Friday playing a key role Reading won 5–0. In particular, Friday scored a goal after 17 minutes described by the "Evening Post" reporter as "magical": with the score 1–0 to Reading, Friday received the ball near the edge of the penalty area, at a tight angle, and coolly kicked the ball with the outside of his boot low across goal, towards the far post. Although it appeared to be heading yards wide of the net, the ball suddenly curved in at the last possible moment—"right around the goalie", in the phrase of Reading F.C. historian David Downs—and clipped the goalpost before nestling in the back of the net. "The team that has been transformed by Robin Friday has now scored a remarkable 16 goals in five games," reported the "Evening Post", "and the highlight of this joyous afternoon was a goal by Friday that was worth anyone's admission money on its own."

Despite his immediate impact on the pitch and the upturn in Reading's form, Friday's off-the-field activities unsettled some of his teammates. Most tolerated his lifestyle because of his importance to the team, but some, particularly defender <a href="Tommy%20Youlden">Tommy Youlden</a>, were sceptical. He drank extremely heavily, favouring American <a href="Colt%2045%20%28malt%20liquor%29">Colt 45</a> malt liquor, and his antics during his drinking sessions caused many landlords to lose patience with him. For example, Friday was barred from <a href="Caversham%2C%20Berkshire">Caversham</a>'s Crown public house after he ended a night there leaping between the tables and dancing on the bar. The Boar's Head in <a href="Reading%2C%20Berkshire">Reading</a> banned him on ten separate occasions. One night, after the pubs closed, Friday and a friend, Rod Lewington, went to an all-night club called Churchill's where they could continue drinking. When they entered, Friday, wearing a long overcoat and <a href="Hobnail%20%28footwear%29">hobnail boots</a>, walked onto the dancefloor and removed the coat to reveal that he was wearing nothing underneath. He then began to dance, completely naked apart from the boots.

Although Churchill's, described by Lewington as "the worst club that has ever been in Reading", tolerated such behaviour, the town's fashionable Sindlesham Mill nightclub did not, regularly barring Friday for his bizarre activities, including a dance he invented called "the elephant" which consisted of turning the pockets of his jeans inside out and undoing his flies to expose himself. He and his friends would regularly drink all day, though he was able to exert some self-control; according to his friend Syd Simmonds, Friday would obey Hurley's instruction not to drink for 48 hours before each game. However, he would play his prized <a href="Heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a> records very loudly at any time of the day or night and take <a href="Lysergic%20acid%20diethylamide">LSD</a> with casual indifference. Hurley attempted to calm Friday down by moving him into an apartment above the football club's elderly ex-groundsman, but to no avail: "Even if it was three in the morning, the first thing would be to get the music playing", Simmonds later said. "We had an old boy living below us ... the ex-groundsman at Reading. He was coming up to 80 and he had a dog's life in the flat. Pounding music, people knocking on the door, girls throwing stones at the windows. Poor old sod."

Reading finished the <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20Football%20League">1973–74</a> season in sixth position, one place higher than the previous year. Friday underwent an operation to have tattoos removed from his fingers during the summer break, and afterwards joined a <a href="hippie">hippie</a> commune in Cornwall, neglecting to inform Reading of this latter decision. He was absent without explanation when training started for the <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20Football%20League">1974–75</a> season in July 1974, arriving only on the day of a closed-doors <a href="Exhibition%20game">friendly</a> against Watford. Despite his lack of training, he far out-performed the rest of the team. He continued to play well when the League programme began the following month. By September 1974 he was attracting the interest of <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> sides <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> and <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>. The former had been following him since the game at Barnsley back in February, when he had still been an amateur. Arsenal manager <a href="Bertie%20Mee">Bertie Mee</a> personally attended Reading's 4–2 home win over <a href="Rotherham%20United%20F.C.">Rotherham United</a> on 12 September, but neither his team nor Sheffield United attempted to sign Friday.

After Reading despatched <a href="Newport%20County%20A.F.C.">Newport County</a> 3–0 on 14 September 1974, Friday and his forward partner <a href="Dick%20Habbin">Dick Habbin</a> had scored six goals each and topped the Football League goalscoring charts. However, at the same time Friday's disciplinary record was becoming so bad that even the "Evening Post", usually favourable to him, criticised him on 30 September 1974, just after he had scored his first <a href="hat-trick">hat-trick</a> for Reading in a 4–1 victory over <a href="Southport%20F.C.">Southport</a>. He was the Football League's joint top scorer by this time with nine goals, but he had also already been booked three times that season and the "Post" argued that by constantly risking suspension he was letting the team down. Under the system then used, the three bookings gave him an automatic two-match suspension. The article argued that missing games because of "completely unnecessary" and "stupid" infractions amounted to selling the club short.

Friday's behaviour on Reading away trips was unpredictable and erratic: in the words of teammate <a href="John%20Murray%20%28English%20footballer%29">John Murray</a>, "Some of the things he did were funny but other times they were just mad". On the way back from one away match, the team bus pulled over and Friday noticed that they were beside a cemetery. Friday jumped over the wall and stole some stone angels from a grave, intending to place them beside the club chairman Frank Waller, who was sleeping on the coach. When he returned, Hurley sternly told him that "you must never ever desecrate a graveyard"—Friday dutifully returned the statues. On another occasion, Friday reacted to the news that a teammate had smuggled a girl into his hotel room by kicking the door in. Later on the same night he walked into the bar carrying a swan that he had found in the hotel grounds.

During an FA Cup tie away against <a href="Swindon%20Town%20F.C.">Swindon Town</a> on 23 November, Friday began to have trouble breathing and despite leaving the game for five minutes to recuperate with an <a href="inhaler">inhaler</a> was eventually forced to come off for good, coughing violently. After recovering from what was reported to be a chest infection, he returned to the team on 28 December, having missed four matches, and marked his return with his side's only goal in a 3–1 home defeat to <a href="Stockport%20County%20F.C.">Stockport County</a>. Reading dropped to 12th place on 6 January 1975, and were only three points above the <a href="Re-election%20%28Football%20League%29">re-election</a> places; however, by the time they took on <a href="Workington%20A.F.C.">Workington</a> at home on 3 February they had risen to 10th. Reading won 3–0, with Friday scoring the third goal with a spectacular header: "Diving full length barely a foot off the ground, Friday risked life and limb to head home a truly memorable goal", wrote the "Evening Post" match reporter. "True to form, he had to spoil things for himself by getting booked three minutes later".

This victory marked the beginning of a run of six wins out of seven games, after which the side was once again challenging for <a href="promotion%20and%20relegation">promotion</a> to the third tier, hovering between sixth and eighth place for the rest of the season. By 11 April promotion looked improbable, but Friday was still overjoyed after scoring the last-minute winner in Reading's 2–1 victory over <a href="Rochdale%20A.F.C">Rochdale</a>. In celebration he ran behind the net and kissed a policeman. "The policeman looked so cold and fed up standing there", explained the Reading forward, publicly, "that I decided to cheer him up a bit." In the dressing room after the game he said, privately, that he wished he hadn't done it "because I hate coppers so much". Reading eventually finished the 1974–75 season in seventh place, five points behind the promoted teams. Friday was the club's top scorer for the season, with 18 league goals and 20 overall, and was voted its player of the year.

Friday's fine form continued into the <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20Football%20League">1975–76</a> season; after their 4–2 victory over <a href="Hartlepool%20United%20F.C.">Hartlepool United</a> on 23 September 1975, Reading were top of the Fourth Division having just won four games in a row. Friday, meanwhile, was the club's top scorer. The next game was against <a href="A.F.C.%20Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> on the 27th, and although Reading won 2–1 Friday was sent off after 79 minutes. By this time the forward was overwhelmingly popular among Reading's fans, to whom he endeared himself by performing a lap of honour after each goal he scored. A month later, after two wins, two defeats and a draw during October, the team was fourth in the table.
Friday was arrested after the evening match away at Newport County on 20 October, accused of using obscene language outside a <a href="Newport%2C%20Wales">Newport</a> nightclub. At his appearance before magistrates in Newport on 17 November, he pleaded not guilty, representing himself, and was acquitted. Performing strongly for Reading and scoring regularly, he began to attract serious interest from other clubs. "Friday is, of course, much more than Reading's top scorer and best striker", wrote the "Evening Post" on 3 November 1975. "He is the most vital cog in the team, and last week I understand Reading turned down a £60,000 bid from <a href="Cardiff%20City%20F.C.">Cardiff City</a> involving <a href="Wales%20national%20football%20team">Welsh</a> international <a href="Derek%20Showers">Derek Showers</a>". By the new year, Reading were third in the table, on course for promotion and two points behind league leaders <a href="Lincoln%20City%20F.C.">Lincoln City</a>.

After Reading went four games without a win starting on 24 January 1976, a late goal from Friday ended this run on 25 February, in a home match against Hartlepool United; twelve minutes from time, he collected a pass from <a href="Stewart%20Henderson">Stewart Henderson</a> and neatly placed the ball past the goalkeeper from the edge of the penalty area. "One is increasingly under the impression", the "Evening Post" reported, "that if Friday was out for some time through injury the Reading team would fall to pieces". Led by the free-scoring Friday, the side continued its push for promotion; fourth or higher would be enough to go up. A vital fixture on 31 March 1976 pitted fourth-placed Reading at home against <a href="Tranmere%20Rovers%20F.C.">Tranmere Rovers</a>, who occupied third spot; internationally experienced referee <a href="Clive%20Thomas">Clive Thomas</a> took charge of the game. Friday, who had already scored 18 goals that season, rose to the occasion with an effort that has been described by many sources as one of the greatest ever scored.

With the score 2–0 to Reading, the goalkeeper <a href="Steve%20Death">Steve Death</a> threw the ball to the right back <a href="Gary%20Peters%20%28footballer%29">Gary Peters</a>, who spotted Friday standing near the left-hand corner of the opposing penalty area. Peters passed high and diagonally across the pitch towards his forward, who jumped into the air and used his chest to cushion the ball and knock it into the air with his back to goal, about 25–30 yards away from the net. As Friday landed, he ferociously powered the ball towards goal, kicking over his shoulder and turning after the ball had gone. The shot flew straight into the top-right-hand corner of the net, stunning the crowd, players and Thomas, the referee, who put his hands over his head in disbelief. "I'll never forget it", Thomas recalled. "It was the sheer ferocity of the shot on the volley ... over his shoulder. ... If it hadn't gone into the top corner of the net it would have broken the goalpost. Even up against the likes of <a href="Pel%C3%A9">Pelé</a> and <a href="Johan%20Cruyff">Cruyff</a>, that rates as the best goal I have ever seen." Reading went on to win the game 5–0. When Thomas told Friday after the game that he had never seen a better goal, the Londoner replied, "Really? You should come down here more often, I do that every week."

Reading moved to within one point of promotion on 19 April 1976 with a 1–0 home victory over <a href="Brentford%20F.C.">Brentford</a>. Friday set up the game's only goal, beating three players before hitting the post with his shot; <a href="Ray%20Hiron">Ray Hiron</a> scored from the rebound. Friday scored a powerful left-footed volley during the first half of a 2–2 draw away against <a href="Cambridge%20United%20F.C.">Cambridge United</a> two days later. The result secured Third Division football for Reading. At the celebratory dinner after the game, the Reading <a href="captain%20%28sports%29">captain</a> <a href="Gordon%20Cumming%20%28footballer%29">Gordon Cumming</a> saw some fluted wine glasses, and voiced his admiration: "I wouldn't mind a few of them for home", he said. "Give us a few minutes and I'll get them for you", replied Friday. Going around the dining room and picking them off the tables, he stole a whole boxful of the glasses, which he managed to sneak out of the hotel and onto the team coach, but much to Cumming's annoyance he then decided to keep them for himself. With 22 goals for the year, 21 in the league, Friday was once more Reading's top goalscorer and for the second consecutive season the team's player of the year.

After Reading were promoted, Waller met with the players on 4 June 1976 to discuss their contracts for the <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20Football%20League">1976–77</a> season. The wages offered to the Reading players were far lower than they had been expecting, causing the team's morale to fall drastically. "We got screwed by the club", midfielder <a href="Eamon%20Dunphy">Eamon Dunphy</a> later claimed. "We didn't get what we had been promised." Friday was so offended by the low salary offered that he handed in a transfer request, telling the "Evening Post" that the club's directors clearly did not share his ambition. "They would be happy to stroll along in the bottom half of the Third Division forever", he said. The row over the new contracts continued throughout the off-season, while Friday planned his second wedding; he had been formally divorced from Maxine after years of separation, and subsequently engaged to Liza Deimel, a Reading-born university graduate. After the pay dispute was settled on 5 August, the couple were married in Reading three days later. The wedding was filmed by <a href="Southern%20Television">Southern Television</a>, before whose cameras Friday, wearing an open-necked tiger-skin-pattern shirt, brown velvet suit and snakeskin boots, sat on the steps of the church and rolled a <a href="Joint%20%28cannabis%29">joint</a>. Friday had invited about two hundred people, mostly friends and relatives from London, who joined in the drinking and drug-taking and ending up fighting each other and stealing the couple's wedding presents, one of which was a large quantity of <a href="Cannabis%20%28drug%29">cannabis</a>. Liza later called the wedding "the most hilarious thing ever". "I have been to a few weddings", recalled Rod Lewington, "but never one like that."

"He lost his way when we got promotion", Hurley later reflected. "He really must have celebrated all through the summer". Friday reported back for pre-season training in bad condition, and although Hurley claimed that Friday was trying hard to regain fitness, the forward was having trouble with his asthma, had lost some of his pace and was obviously unfit. Although his performances during August quickly improved, they were still not up to his previous standard and the "Evening Post" revealed on the 30th that Reading were preparing to sell him "to a First Division club". After scoring in two successive Reading home wins on 4 and 7 September, against <a href="Walsall%20F.C.">Walsall</a> and <a href="Wrexham%20A.F.C.">Wrexham</a> respectively, Friday took part in a third consecutive victory on the 13th, away against <a href="Northampton%20Town%20F.C.">Northampton Town</a>. After this he missed two matches, according to the "Post" because he was suffering from <a href="influenza">flu</a>, and when he returned to the team was far from his best; "Suddenly he had lost a yard and his control of the ball was not as good", Hurley recalled.

Hurley was by now aware that his forward was using drugs, and attempted to keep his player's habit a secret while he patiently worked to bring him back around. However, Friday began to regularly miss training and Hurley's subtlety was misinterpreted as inaction by the other Reading players, who became unsettled and complained about Friday's conduct. The club became increasingly minded to sell him, but although top-flight clubs <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a> and <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> were interested, they were reluctant to buy because of Friday's temperament; in Downs's words, "They weren't sure they could handle him". By the end of October 1976, Hurley had given up on attempting to rehabilitate his player, believing that the only solution was to sell him to a bigger team. "The squad needs you but I owe it to the club because I can't have you using drugs," Hurley told Friday. "If "I" know you're using drugs it won't take "them" [the major clubs] long to find out. You have got to get your act together." Friday was made available for transfer, at his own request, on 28 October.

Friday was watched by other clubs throughout November and December 1976, but although he performed well in some games, including a 1–1 draw away at <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a> on 6 November in which he scored his team's only goal, he was poor in others. After being marked out of the game during Reading's 4–0 loss away against <a href="Mansfield%20Town%20F.C.">Mansfield Town</a> on 8 November, he was substituted. "Coincidence or not", wrote the "Evening Post", "when Friday left, so did half a dozen managers and scouts". Friday was so angry at his team's performance that he broke into the Mansfield dressing room and defecated in the team bath. Reading's asking price stood at £50,000, and the first transfer offer came from <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> side Cardiff City around mid-December. Cardiff boss <a href="Jimmy%20Andrews">Jimmy Andrews</a> bid £28,000, half of his offer a year before, which Reading's directors accepted, wanting the troublesome player off their hands as quickly as possible. Friday was reluctant to go to the Welsh club, saying that it was too far from home, that he wanted to go to a First Division team and that he wanted more money than was being offered; however, when Hurley told him that unless he went to Cardiff he would be <a href="Free%20transfer%20%28football%29">released</a>, he agreed and travelled to Wales on 30 December 1976.

On arrival at <a href="Cardiff%20Central%20railway%20station">Cardiff Central railway station</a>, Friday was arrested by the <a href="British%20Transport%20Police">British Transport Police</a> for having travelled from Reading with only a <a href="platform%20ticket">platform ticket</a>. Andrews bailed his new player out of police custody and took him to <a href="Ninian%20Park">Ninian Park</a> to sign the contract. Despite the manner of Friday's arrival, and although he knew there "had to be something wrong with him", the Cardiff manager was still happy with his purchase, describing the £28,000 transfer as "an absolute steal". After a long night of drinking the night before his Cardiff debut, Friday lined up against <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a> on 1 January 1977. The Fulham defence included former <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> <a href="List%20of%20England%20national%20football%20team%20captains">captain</a> <a href="Bobby%20Moore">Bobby Moore</a>, but Friday marked his first match for the Welsh club with two goals; he also squeezed Moore's testicles during the game as Cardiff won 3–0. Andrews was so happy with Friday's performance that he phoned Hurley two days later, on Monday morning. "Oh, Charlie", Andrews gushed, "he was magnificent. He tore them inside out. ... Moore was chasing him all over the place". The Cardiff manager continued to heap praise on his new acquisition until Hurley finally stopped him. "Jimmy, you've only had him four days", he warned, sombrely: "Give it a few months"...

Friday's form declined after his strong debut and his personal life remained troubled and chaotic, leading him to vanish regularly and miss Cardiff matches. He was supposed to be living in <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a>, but his manager would often find on visiting his house that he had been elsewhere for weeks. Leslie Hamilton, the Cardiff club doctor, later said that he had believed at the time that Andrews was being far too soft on Friday; indeed, according to teammate <a href="Paul%20Went">Paul Went</a>, the forward would simply leave after each match and not be heard of until he returned for the next game. "He wouldn't even bother to have a shower", Went later said, in an interview. "He'd just get dressed, take his carrier-bag with his dry martini and he'd go—no explanation".

While Hurley had been able to command Friday's respect, it soon became clear that Andrews was unable to control him and that the Londoner disliked his new manager. Indeed, soon after moving to Cardiff, Friday appeared one day in Hurley's office at Elm Park asking to come back to Reading. "He still called me boss", Hurley recalled. "I can't play for that little bastard", Friday told Hurley, referring to Andrews. "You're the one who seems to be able to get me right. Can I come back to you?" Hurley replied that although he would be happy to have Friday back on the team, the club could not afford to repay the £28,000 transfer fee to Cardiff, so he would have to go back and continue playing there. Unhappy living so far from home, Friday began to travel back to London at weekends; he avoided paying rail fares by knocking on locked toilet doors and shouting, "Tickets, please!", pretending to be the ticket inspector. When the occupant passed his ticket under the door to be checked, Friday would pick it up, walk off and use it for himself. Paul Went also recalled an incident during training when he had thrown a ball out from goal and accidentally hit Friday on the back of the head. A player standing near the forward started laughing, leading Friday to conclude that he had thrown the ball. Friday viciously punched the laughing player in the jaw, striking him with such force that he wore a <a href="Cervical%20collar">neck brace</a> for two weeks afterwards.

Late in Friday's first season in Wales, Cardiff took on <a href="Luton%20Town%20F.C.">Luton Town</a> on 16 April 1977. Cardiff were in the <a href="promotion%20and%20relegation">relegation</a> zone and had not won in seven games, while Luton were fifth in the table and challenging for promotion. After clashing repeatedly early in the match with Luton goalkeeper <a href="Milija%20Aleksic">Milija Aleksic</a>, Friday was lectured by the referee for a high tackle on the goalkeeper in the 36th minute. Friday held out a hand to apologise, but Aleksic reacted angrily. When the free kick was taken, Friday ran back, stole the ball from Luton defender <a href="John%20Faulkner%20%28footballer%29">John Faulkner</a>, broke away, rounded Aleksic and slotted the ball past him into the net. In celebration, Friday jogged back past the goalkeeper while giving him the <a href="V%20sign%23V%20sign%20as%20an%20insult">V-sign</a>. Cardiff won the match 4–2 and at the end of the season avoided relegation to the third tier only on <a href="goal%20difference">goal difference</a>. Meanwhile, without Friday, Reading were relegated back to the Fourth Division by one point. Friday's actions became even stranger during his time at Cardiff; after they lost the second leg of the <a href="Welsh%20Cup">Welsh Cup</a> final 3–0 to <a href="Shrewsbury%20Town%20F.C.">Shrewsbury Town</a> on 18 May 1977, the players and staff were awoken in the middle of the night by loud bangs coming from below their rooms. The cause was found to be Friday, standing on the hotel's snooker table in his underpants and throwing the balls around the room in fury.

After failing to turn up for pre-season training with Cardiff before the <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20Football%20League">1977–78</a> season, Friday was reported to be in a London hospital suffering from an unknown virus which had caused him to lose in weight. When he suddenly appeared in Cardiff for training in October, two months into the season, he claimed to have been suffering from <a href="hepatitis">hepatitis</a>, but medical tests disproved this. Andrews told the local press that on arrival Friday had looked "like the fittest player in the world", and hoping to avoid further disappearances persuaded a reluctant Friday to move from Bristol to Cardiff. The Londoner returned to the team for the away match at <a href="Brighton%20%26amp%3B%20Hove%20Albion%20F.C.">Brighton & Hove Albion</a> on 29 October 1977, with Cardiff once again in the relegation zone, in 20th place on goal difference.

Friday was marked during the game by <a href="Mark%20Lawrenson">Mark Lawrenson</a>, who so frustrated the Cardiff forward with his close attention that Friday waited for Lawrenson to attempt a slide tackle and then kicked him in the face. After receiving a <a href="red%20card%20%28sports%29">red card</a>, Friday left the ground with the game still going on; according to legend, before leaving he broke into the Brighton dressing room and defecated in Lawrenson's kit bag. Cardiff eventually lost 4–0. "I am sick and tired of it", Andrews told the "<a href="South%20Wales%20Echo">South Wales Echo</a>" on 1 November. "To be sent off in his first game back is as much as a man can stand". Friday was <a href="Transfer%20market%23Transfer%20list">transfer-listed</a> and served a three-match suspension before making his final appearance on 10 December in Cardiff's 6–3 away defeat against <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton</a>. Liza was by now the mother of Friday's second daughter, Arabella, but around this time began divorce proceedings. Friday claimed that he had had enough of people telling him what to do, and walked into Andrews's office on 20 December 1977 to announce that he was retiring from professional football. The club promptly released him and cancelled his contract.

After retiring, Friday moved back to London and returned to work as an asphalter and decorator. Soon after Friday left Cardiff, Reading manager <a href="Maurice%20Evans%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201936%29">Maurice Evans</a> was presented with a petition, signed by 3,000 supporters, requesting that he attempt to re-sign Friday. Evans contacted Friday and told him: "If you would just settle down for three or four years, you could play for England". Friday replied with the question "How old are you?", and after Evans answered, continued: "I'm half your age and I've lived twice your life". Evans reflected, "You may well be right". Friday trained with <a href="Brentford%20F.C.">Brentford</a> during the <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20Football%20League">1978–79</a> pre-season, but after regaining his fitness suddenly changed his mind and stopped coming to training. He married for a third time in 1980, but was divorced again within three years. After a short time living back with his parents in Acton, Friday's family secured him a <a href="housing%20association">housing association</a> flat in the area. He served a prison sentence during the 1980s for <a href="police%20impersonation">impersonating a police officer</a> and confiscating people's drugs, and was found dead in his Acton flat on 22 December 1990 at the age of 38, having suffered a fatal heart attack. Biographer <a href="Paolo%20Hewitt">Paolo Hewitt</a> claimed the incident to be the result of "a suspected <a href="heroin%20overdose">heroin overdose</a>".

Friday is often cited as an unsung talent. A latterly applied nickname, "the greatest footballer you never saw", was used as the title of his 1997 biography, co-written by <a href="Oasis%20%28band%29">Oasis</a> <a href="bassist">bass player</a> <a href="Paul%20McGuigan%20%28musician%29">Paul McGuigan</a> and Hewitt. Both as a player and a personality, Friday remains a major figure for both of his professional clubs. <a href="BBC%20Radio%20Berkshire">BBC Radio Berkshire</a> Sports Editor <a href="Tim%20Dellor">Tim Dellor</a>, speaking in 2010, emphasised the importance of Friday's charisma to his contemporary and retrospective appeal, a point which was also highlighted by his second wife, Liza, who likened his personal charm to that of "a <a href="Pied%20Piper%20of%20Hamelin">pied piper</a>". In terms of significance to Reading F.C., Dellor stated that Friday was the team's "very own <a href="George%20Best">George Best</a>". Cardiff-based band <a href="Super%20Furry%20Animals">Super Furry Animals</a> used a photograph of him giving the V-sign to Aleksic in 1977 for the artwork of their 1996 single "<a href="The%20Man%20Don%27t%20Give%20a%20Fuck">The Man Don't Give a Fuck</a>", which was dedicated to his memory "and his stand against '<a href="the%20Man">the Man</a>'.

After winning the title of "Player of the Millennium" from Reading in 1999, he was voted the top "all-time cult hero" for both Reading and Cardiff in a 2004 <a href="BBC">BBC</a> poll; with similar polls taking place at each <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> and <a href="The%20Football%20League">Football League</a> club, he was the only player to appear in the top three for two different sides. In 2007, a poll of fans run by Reading resulted in his once more being named the club's best ever. Later that year, when the <a href="Professional%20Footballers%27%20Association">Professional Footballers' Association</a> (PFA) canvassed Reading supporters for their all-time favourite, Friday won again. In a parallel PFA survey, Cardiff fans chose one of Friday's former teammates, <a href="Wales%20national%20football%20team">Wales</a> international defender <a href="Phil%20Dwyer">Phil Dwyer</a>. Friday was ranked first in <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a>'s list of football "bad boys" in August 2007, while "<a href="Football365">Football365</a>" placed him at eighth place in a 2010 list of "wasted talents".

Friday's style of play was based around his exceptional ball skills, described by Cardiff doctor Leslie Hamilton as "absolutely fabulous", and his instinctive footballing vision, which enabled him both to execute flamboyant individual moves and to create attacks for his teammates. Jimmy Andrews, his manager at Cardiff, later called Friday "the complete centre-forward" and placed him on a par with <a href="Alan%20Shearer">Alan Shearer</a>, while Maurice Evans claimed that he could have played for England, and was at least on a level with international strikers he had worked with such as <a href="John%20Aldridge">John Aldridge</a> and <a href="Dean%20Saunders">Dean Saunders</a>. This opinion was shared by Hamilton and Friday's Reading teammate <a href="John%20Murray%20%28English%20footballer%29">John Murray</a>, both of whom firmly declared in separate interviews that Friday would have been good enough for the England team had he "sorted his head out", in Hamilton's words.

A natural goalscoring forward, Friday was also unselfish and would take just as much pleasure out of setting up a goal scored by a teammate as netting one himself. He possessed fine ball control and dribbling skills, and could also shoot with both great power and sharp accuracy. The strong physical aspect of his game and exceptionally competitive, combative spirit combined with all of this to create a formidable forward player: such was his ability that his arrival transformed Reading into one of the division's best sides in a matter of weeks. Writing in 2010, Roger Titford stressed Friday's immediate and profound impact on the Reading team as a key factor in his lasting popularity: "It was like the comic-book stories that kids from Robin's era would have read", he wrote. "He was a ready-made star".

On top of his technical talent, Friday was physically very strong and able to withstand sustained blows or injuries. According to Hamilton, he was also uncommonly fit despite his lifestyle. He boasted an exceptional work-rate, which Dwyer recalled gave any side including him a strong boost: "When he was in the line-up you'd have a centre-forward "and" a centre-half; not only would he be up there running them ragged, but when it broke down he'd be the first person to start tackling back". He was assisted in this by a smooth and effective sliding tackle which despite all of Friday's attacking skills Hurley considered one of the strongest parts of his game. Reading F.C. historian David Downs described Friday's style of play as "really quite bizarre. It was more or less Robin standing in the middle and saying 'Give me the ball and I'll see what I can do with it'". On receiving the ball, he would then turn and either take on the opposing defence single-handed or run with it to the wing to cross for a teammate. "We didn't need anyone else up front", Hurley later said. "They couldn't get the ball off him. He was one of those guys who could beat five players easily". Andrews agreed: "once he'd got the ball it was almost impossible to get it off him".

Friday was known for giving his all in any game in which he played, no matter the circumstances. Hurley later said that Friday would often become furious at his teammates for not trying their best, even in training. This strong drive to always win even extended to the use of physical intimidation to unsettle opposing players, leading contemporary critics to label him a "villain". Friday also employed the use of psychological tactics; aiming to spook opposing players, Friday would kiss them or fondle their testicles. Cardiff teammate <a href="Paul%20Went">Paul Went</a> recalled that these tricks would "completely <a href="wiktionary%3Athrow%23Etymology%201">throw</a>" defenders and affect their concentration. Although he was often criticised for the number of bookings and sendings-off he received, Friday believed he was justified to chase victory by any means, explaining his attitude in a 1977 interview: "On the pitch I hate all opponents. I don't give a damn about anyone. People think I'm mad, a lunatic. I am a winner".

Interstate 296

Interstate 296 (I-296) is a part of the <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway System</a> in the US state of <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>. It is a <a href="Michigan%20State%20Trunkline%20Highway%20System">state trunkline highway</a> that runs for entirely within the <a href="Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan">Grand Rapids</a> area. Its termini are <a href="Interstate%20196">I-196</a> near downtown Grand Rapids and <a href="Interstate%20196">I-196</a> on the north side of Grand Rapids in <a href="Walker%2C%20Michigan">Walker</a>. For most of its length, the Interstate <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">runs concurrently</a> with <a href="U.S.%20Route%20131">U.S. Highway 131</a> (US 131), which continues as a freeway built to <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20standards">Interstate Highway standards</a> north and south of the shorter I-296. The highway was first proposed in the late 1950s and opened in December 1962, but the <a href="Michigan%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Michigan Department of Transportation</a> (MDOT) has since eliminated all signage for I-296 and removed the designation from their official state map. The designation is therefore <a href="unsigned%20highway">unsigned</a>, but still listed on the Interstate Highway System route log maintained by the <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a> (FHWA).

I-296 begins at the I-196 interchange west of the <a href="Grand%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Grand River</a> and downtown Grand Rapids. For a short distance within the interchange, the three northbound lanes are on the left and the three southbound lanes are on the right, contrary to the normal traffic arrangement in the US. This anomaly is reversed north of the ramps for I-196 as the southbound lanes go over the northbound lanes. Running parallel to the Grand River on the west bank, the freeway designation begins across the river from the 6th Street Bridge Park and <a href="Belknap%20Hill">Belknap Hill</a> north of the <a href="Gerald%20R.%20Ford%20Presidential%20Museum">Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum</a> and the <a href="DeVos%20Place%20Convention%20Center">DeVos Place Convention Center</a>. The west side of the freeway faces residential neighborhoods and the east side borders commercial businesses and the river. South of the Ann Street interchange, the highway crosses a line of the <a href="Grand%20Rapids%20Eastern%20Railroad">Grand Rapids Eastern Railroad</a>. After crossing both the railroad and Ann Street, the highway widens to allow for a grassy <a href="Central%20reservation">median</a>. The freeway leaves Grand Rapids and enters Walker north of Ann Street.

Approaching I-96 from the south, the freeway passes east of the <a href="DeltaPlex%20Arena">DeltaPlex Arena</a>, and the median widens further across the river from Comstock Riverside Park in Walker. An extra lane is added on the left, widening the freeway to four lanes. Unsigned I-296 occupies the left two lanes that form the left exit for I-96 from US 131. At the split between I-296 and US 131, I-296 curves northwest, and US 131 curves northeast to follow a bend in the Grand River. Once I-296 diverges from US 131, the highway crosses a rail line owned by <a href="CSX%20Transportation">CSX Transportation</a> and passes over West River Drive. To the northwest of these crossings, exits emerge on the right for eastbound I-96 and the left for northbound M-37 (Alpine Avenue). Past these exits, I-296 merges into westbound I-96 and terminates. Southbound unsigned I-296 begins where the ramps to US 131 southbound split from eastbound I-96 at the Alpine Avenue overpass, merging with southbound US 131 north of Ann Street.

The development of a freeway along the modern-day I-296/US 131 corridor was proposed in the 1950s. The 1955 "<a href="General%20Location%20of%20National%20System%20of%20Interstate%20Highways">General Location of National System of Interstate Highways</a>", an early platform for what would become the Interstate Highway System, contained an inset of the proposed freeways in and around the Grand Rapids area including a north–south freeway near the downtown area. Designated as part of the <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway System</a> in 1957, I-296's construction was funded by the federal government.

The US 131 freeway was officially opened at 10 a.m. on December 17, 1962, between Pearl Street and (at the time) the I-196/<a href="U.S.%20Route%2016%20in%20Michigan">US 16</a> freeway north of downtown. This freeway section encompassed all of I-296, which would connect I-196 north of town with I-96 downtown. (The I-96 and I-196 designations were later flipped west of Grand Rapids.) M-37 was relocated in Grand Rapids to utilize I-96 around the northeast side of town instead of I-296/US 131 in 1969.

At the end of the 1970s, MDOT took part in a FHWA-backed initiative called the Positive Guidance Demonstration Project, and the two agencies audited signage practices in the vicinity of the I-96/M-37 and I-296/US 131 interchange in Walker. MDOT determined that usage of the I-296 designation was "a potential source of confusion for motorists." FHWA agreed with the department's proposal to eliminate all signage and public map references to the designation in April 1979. MDOT then petitioned the <a href="American%20Association%20of%20State%20Highway%20and%20Transportation%20Officials">American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials</a> (AASHTO) on June 22, 1979, for their permission to make the change, saying "it is felt that the I-296 designation serves no useful purpose other than to designate an Interstate routing." AASHTO approved the request on October 13. On October 24 that year, MDOT also requested formal permission from the FHWA to remove all signage and map references to I-296. The FHWA granted permission on December 3, 1979, on the condition that MDOT would continue to use the designation on official documents. The approval explicitly retained the highway in the Interstate system for funding and other purposes. The last state map to show the I-296 designation was published in 1979, as the 1980 map lacks any reference to the designation. Other maps, like the one published by the Kent County Road Commission, occasionally show I-296, and FHWA includes the designation in their "Route Log and Finder List" for the Interstate Highway System.

<doc id="745960" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=745960" title="Corinthian War">
Corinthian War

The Corinthian War was an <a href="Ancient%20Greece">ancient Greek</a> conflict lasting from 395 BC until 387 BC, pitting <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a> against a coalition of four allied states, <a href="Thebes%20%28Greece%29">Thebes</a>, <a href="History%20of%20Athens%23Classical%20Athens">Athens</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Corinth">Corinth</a>, and <a href="Argos">Argos</a>, who were initially backed by <a href="Achaemenid%20Dynasty">Persia</a>. The immediate cause of the war was a local conflict in northwest Greece in which both Thebes and Sparta intervened. The deeper cause was hostility towards Sparta provoked by that city's "expansionism in <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>, central and northern Greece and even the west".

The war was fought on two fronts, on land near Corinth (hence the name) and Thebes and at sea in the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean</a>. On land, the Spartans achieved several early successes in major battles, but were unable to capitalize on their advantage, and the fighting soon became stalemated. At sea, the Spartan fleet was decisively defeated by a Persian fleet early in the war, an event that effectively ended Sparta's attempts to become a naval power. Taking advantage of this fact, Athens launched several naval campaigns in the later years of the war, recapturing a number of islands that had been part of the original <a href="Delian%20League">Delian League</a> during the 5th century BC.

Alarmed by these Athenian successes, the Persians stopped backing the allies and began supporting Sparta. This defection forced the allies to seek peace. The King's Peace, also known as the <a href="Peace%20of%20Antalcidas">Peace of Antalcidas</a>, was signed in 387 BC, ending the war. This treaty declared that Persia would control all of <a href="Ionia">Ionia</a>, and that all other Greek cities would be independent. Sparta was to be the guardian of the peace, with the power to enforce its clauses. The effects of the war, therefore, were to establish Persia's ability to interfere successfully in Greek politics and to affirm Sparta's <a href="hegemony">hegemonic</a> position in the Greek political system.

In the <a href="Peloponnesian%20War">Peloponnesian War</a>, which had ended in 404 BC, Sparta had enjoyed the support of nearly every mainland Greek state and the Persian Empire, and in the months and years following that war, a number of the island states of the Aegean had come under its control. This solid base of support, however, was fragmented in the years following the war. Despite the collaborative nature of the victory, Sparta alone received the plunder taken from the defeated states and the tribute payments from the former Athenian Empire. Sparta's allies were further alienated when, in 402 BC, Sparta attacked and subdued <a href="Elis">Elis</a>, a member of the <a href="Peloponnesian%20League">Peloponnesian League</a> that had angered the Spartans during the course of the Peloponnesian War. Corinth and Thebes refused to send troops to assist Sparta in its campaign against Elis.

Thebes, Corinth and Athens also refused to participate in a Spartan expedition to <a href="Ionia">Ionia</a> in 398 BC, with the Thebans going so far as to disrupt a sacrifice that the Spartan king <a href="Agesilaus%20II">Agesilaus</a> attempted to perform in their territory before his departure. Despite the absence of these states, Agesilaus campaigned effectively against the Persians in <a href="Lydia">Lydia</a>, advancing as far inland as <a href="Sardis">Sardis</a>. The <a href="satrap">satrap</a> <a href="Tissaphernes">Tissaphernes</a> was executed for his failure to contain Agesilaus, and his replacement, <a href="Tithraustes">Tithraustes</a>, bribed the Spartans to move north, into the satrapy of <a href="Pharnabazus%20%285th%20century%20BC%29">Pharnabazus</a>. Agesilaus did so, but simultaneously began preparing a sizable navy.
Unable to defeat Agesilaus' army, Pharnabazus decided to force Agesilaus to withdraw by stirring up trouble on the Greek mainland. He dispatched <a href="Timocrates%20of%20Rhodes">Timocrates of Rhodes</a>, an Asiatic Greek, to distribute ten thousand gold darics in the major cities of the mainland and incite them to act against Sparta. Timocrates visited Athens, Thebes, Corinth, and Argos, and succeeded in persuading powerful factions in each of those states to pursue an anti-Spartan policy. According to <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>, Agesilaus, the Spartan king, said upon leaving Asia "I have been driven out by 10,000 Persian archers", a reference to "Archers" ("<a href="Toxotai">Toxotai</a>") the Greek nickname for the <a href="Daric">Daric</a>s from their obverse design, because that much money had been paid to politicians in Athens and Thebes in order to start a war against Sparta. The Thebans, who had previously demonstrated their antipathy towards Sparta, undertook to bring about a war.

<a href="Xenophon">Xenophon</a> claims that, unwilling to challenge Sparta directly, the Thebans instead choose to precipitate a war by encouraging their allies, the <a href="Locris">Locrians</a>, to collect taxes from territory claimed by both Locris and <a href="Phocis">Phocis</a>. In response, the Phocians invaded Locris, and ransacked Locrian territory. The Locrians appealed to Thebes for assistance, and the Thebans invaded Phocian territory; the Phocians, in turn, appealed to their ally, Sparta, and the Spartans, pleased to have a pretext to discipline the Thebans, ordered general mobilization. A Theban embassy was dispatched to Athens to request support; the Athenians voted to assist Thebes, and a perpetual alliance was concluded between Athens and the <a href="Boeotian%20confederacy">Boeotian confederacy</a>.

The Spartan plan called for two armies, one under <a href="Lysander">Lysander</a> and the other under <a href="Pausanias%20of%20Sparta">Pausanias</a>, to rendezvous at and attack the Boeotian city of <a href="Haliartus">Haliartus</a>. Lysander, arriving before Pausanias, successfully persuaded the city of <a href="Orchomenus%20%28Boeotia%29">Orchomenus</a> to revolt from the Boeotian confederacy, and advanced to Haliartus with his troops and a force of Orchomenians. There, he was killed in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Haliartus">Battle of Haliartus</a> after bringing his force too near the walls of the city; the battle ended inconclusively, with the Spartans suffering early losses but then defeating a group of Thebans who pursued the Spartans onto rough terrain where they were at a disadvantage. Pausanias, arriving a day later, took back the bodies of the Spartan dead under a truce, and returned to Sparta. There, he was put on trial for his life for failing to arrive and support Lysander at the designated time. He fled to <a href="Tegea">Tegea</a> before he could be convicted.

In the wake of these events, both the Spartans and their opponents prepared for more serious fighting to come. In late 395 BC, Corinth and Argos entered the war as co-belligerents with Athens and Thebes. A council was formed at Corinth to manage the affairs of this alliance. The allies then sent emissaries to a number of smaller states and received the support of many of them.

Alarmed by these developments, the Spartans prepared to send out an army against this new alliance, and sent a messenger to Agesilaus ordering him to return to Greece. The orders were a disappointment to Agesilaus, who had looked forward to further successful campaigning. It is said he wryly observed, but for ten thousand Persian "<a href="daric">archers</a>", he would have vanquished all Asia. Thus, he turned back with his troops, crossing the <a href="Hellespont">Hellespont</a> and marched west through <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>.

After a brief engagement between Thebes and Phocis, in which Thebes was victorious, the allies gathered a large army at Corinth. A sizable force was sent out from Sparta to challenge this force. The forces met at the dry bed of the Nemea River, in Corinthian territory, where the Spartans won a decisive victory. As often happened in <a href="hoplite">hoplite</a> battles, the right flank of each army was victorious, with the Spartans defeating the Athenians while the Thebans, Argives, and Corinthians defeated the various Peloponnesians opposite them; the Spartans then attacked and killed a number of Argives, Corinthians, and Thebans as these troops returned from pursuing the defeated Peloponnesians. The coalition army lost 2,800 men, while the Spartans and their allies lost only 1,100.

The next major action of the war took place at sea, where both the Persians and the Spartans had assembled large fleets during Agesilaus's campaign in Asia. By levying ships from the Aegean states under his control, Agesilaus had raised a force of 120 <a href="trireme">trireme</a>s, which he placed under the command of his brother-in-law <a href="Peisander%20%28general%29">Peisander</a>, who had never held a command of this nature before. The Persians, meanwhile, had already assembled a joint <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a>n, <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>n, and <a href="Cyprus">Cypriot</a> fleet, under the command of the experienced Athenian admiral <a href="Conon">Conon</a>, which had seized <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a> in 396 BC. These two fleets met off the point of <a href="Cnidus">Cnidus</a> in 394 BC. The Spartans fought determinedly, particularly in the vicinity of Peisander's ship, but were eventually overwhelmed; large numbers of ships were sunk or captured, and the Spartan fleet was essentially wiped from the sea. Following this victory, Conon and Pharnabazus sailed along the coast of Ionia, expelling Spartan governors and garrisons from the cities, although they failed to reduce the Spartan bases at <a href="Abydos%2C%20Hellespont">Abydos</a> and <a href="Sestos">Sestos</a> under the command of <a href="Dercylidas">Dercylidas</a>.

By this time, Agesilaus's army, after brushing off attacks from the <a href="Thessaly">Thessalians</a> during its march through that country, had arrived in Boeotia, where it was met by an army gathered from the various states of the anti-Spartan alliance. Agesilaus's force from Asia, composed largely of emancipated <a href="helot">helot</a>s and mercenary veterans of the <a href="Ten%20Thousand%20%28Greek%29">Ten Thousand</a>, was augmented by half a Spartan regiment from Orchomenus, and another half a regiment that had been transported across the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Corinth">Gulf of Corinth</a>. These armies met each other at Coronea, in Theban territory; as at Nemea, both right wings were victorious, with the Thebans breaking through while the rest of the allies were defeated. Seeing that the rest of their force had been defeated, the Thebans formed up to break back through to their camp. Agesilaus met their force head on, and in the struggle that followed a number of Thebans were killed before the remainder were able to force their way through and rejoin their allies. After this victory, Agesilaus sailed with his army across the Gulf of Corinth and returned to Sparta.

The events of 394 BC left the Spartans with the upper hand on land, but weak at sea. The coalition states had been unable to defeat the Spartan phalanx in the field, but had kept their alliance strong and prevented the Spartans from moving at will through central Greece. The Spartans would continue to attempt, over the next several years, to knock either Corinth or Argos out of the war; the anti-Spartan allies, meanwhile, sought to preserve their united front against Sparta, while Athens and Thebes took advantage of Sparta's preoccupation to enhance their own power in areas they had traditionally dominated.

In 393 BC, <a href="Conon">Conon</a> and <a href="Pharnabazus%20II">Pharnabazus II</a> sailed to mainland Greece, where they raided the coast of <a href="Laconia">Laconia</a> and seized the island of <a href="Cythera%20%28island%29">Cythera</a>, where they left a garrison and an Athenian governor. They then sailed to Corinth, where they distributed money and urged the members of the council to show the Persian king that they were trustworthy. Pharnabazus then dispatched Conon with substantial funds and a large part of the fleet to <a href="Attica">Attica</a>, where he joined in the rebuilding of the <a href="long%20walls">long walls</a> from Athens to <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a>, a project that had been initiated by <a href="Thrasybulus">Thrasybulus</a> in 394 BC. With the assistance of the rowers of the fleet, and the workers paid for by the Persian money, the construction was soon completed. Athens quickly took advantage of its possession of walls and a fleet to seize the islands of <a href="Scyros">Scyros</a>, <a href="Imbros">Imbros</a>, and <a href="Lemnos">Lemnos</a>, on which it established <a href="cleruchy">cleruchies</a> (citizen colonies).
At about this time, civil strife broke out in Corinth between the <a href="democracy">democratic</a> party and the <a href="oligarchy">oligarchic</a> party. The democrats, supported by the Argives, launched an attack on their opponents, and the oligarchs were driven from the city. These exiles went to the Spartans, based at this time at <a href="Sicyon">Sicyon</a>, for support, while the Athenians and Boeotians came up to support the democrats. In a night attack, the Spartans and exiles succeeded in seizing <a href="Lechaeum">Lechaeum</a>, Corinth's port on the Gulf of Corinth, and defeated the army that came out to challenge them the next day. The anti-Spartan allies then attempted to invest Lechaeum, but the Spartans launched an attack and drove them off.

In 392 BC, the Spartans dispatched an ambassador, <a href="Antalcidas">Antalcidas</a>, to the satrap <a href="Tiribazus">Tiribazus</a>, hoping to turn the Persians against the allies by informing them of Conon's use of the Persian fleet to begin rebuilding the Athenian empire. The Athenians learned of this, and sent Conon and several others to present their case to the Persians; they also notified their allies, and Argos, Corinth, and Thebes dispatched embassies to Tiribazus. At the conference that resulted, the Spartans proposed a peace based on the independence of all states; this was rejected by the allies, as Athens wished to hold the gains it had made in the Aegean, Thebes wished to keep its control over the Boeotian league, and Argos already had designs on assimilating Corinth into its state. The conference thus failed, but Tiribazus, alarmed by Conon's actions, arrested him, and secretly provided the Spartans with money to equip a fleet. Although Conon quickly escaped, he died soon afterward. A second peace conference was held at Sparta in the same year, but the proposals made there were again rejected by the allies, both because of the implications of the autonomy principle and because the Athenians were outraged that the terms proposed would have involved abandoning the Ionian Greeks to Persia.

In the wake of the unsuccessful conference in Persia, Tiribazus returned to <a href="Susa">Susa</a> to report on events, and a new general, <a href="Struthas">Struthas</a>, was sent out to take command. Struthas pursued an anti-Spartan policy, prompting the Spartans to order their commander in the region, <a href="Thimbron%20%28fl.%20400%E2%80%93391%20BC%29">Thibron</a>, to attack him. Thibron successfully ravaged Persian territory for a time, but was killed along with much of his army when Struthas ambushed one of his poorly organized raiding expeditions. Thibron was later replaced by <a href="Diphridas">Diphridas</a>, who raided more successfully, securing a number of small successes and even capturing Struthas's son-in-law, but never achieved any dramatic results.

At Corinth, the democratic party continued to hold the city proper, while the exiles and their Spartan supporters held Lechaeum, from where they raided the Corinthian countryside. In 391 BC, Agesilaus campaigned in the area, successfully seizing several fortified points, along with a large number of prisoners and amounts of booty. While Agesilaus was in camp preparing to sell off his spoils, the Athenian general <a href="Iphicrates">Iphicrates</a>, with a force composed almost entirely of light troops and <a href="peltast">peltast</a>s (javelin throwers), won a decisive victory against the Spartan regiment that had been stationed at Lechaeum in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lechaeum">Battle of Lechaeum</a>. During the battle, Iphicrates took advantage of the Spartans' lack of peltasts to repeatedly harass the regiment with hit-and-run attacks, wearing the Spartans down until they broke and ran, at which point a number of them were slaughtered. Agesilaus returned home shortly after these events, but Iphicrates continued to campaign around Corinth, recapturing many of the strong points which the Spartans had previously taken, although he was unable to retake Lechaeum. He also campaigned against <a href="Phlius">Phlius</a> and <a href="Arcadia">Arcadia</a>, decisively defeating the Phliasians and plundering the territory of the Arcadians when they refused to engage his troops.

After this victory, an Argive army came to Corinth, and, seizing the <a href="acropolis">acropolis</a>, effected the merger of Argos and Corinth. The border stones between Argos and Corinth were torn down, and the citizen bodies of the two cities were merged.

After Iphicrates's victories near Corinth, no more major land campaigns were conducted in that region. Campaigning continued in the Peloponnese and the northwest. Agesilaus had campaigned successfully in Argive territory in 391 BC, and he launched two more major expeditions before the end of the war. In the first of these, in 389 BC, a Spartan expeditionary force crossed the Gulf of Corinth to attack <a href="Acarnania">Acarnania</a>, an ally of the anti-Spartan coalition. After initial difficulties in coming to grips with the Acarnanians, who kept to the mountains and avoided engaging him directly, Agesilaus was eventually able to draw them into a pitched battle, in which the Acarnanians were routed and lost a number of men. He then sailed home across the Gulf. The next year, the Acarnanians made peace with the Spartans to avoid further invasions.

In 388 BC, <a href="Agesipolis%20I">Agesipolis</a> led a Spartan army against Argos. Since no Argive army challenged him, he plundered the countryside for a time, and then, after receiving several unfavorable omens, returned home.

After their defeat at Cnidus, the Spartans began to rebuild a fleet, and, in fighting with Corinth, had regained control of the Gulf of Corinth by 392 BC. Following the failure of the peace conferences of 392 BC, the Spartans sent a small fleet, under the commander Ecdicus, to the Aegean with orders to assist oligarchs exiled from Rhodes. Ecdicus arrived at Rhodes to find the democrats fully in control, and in possession of more ships than him, and thus waited at Cnidus. The Spartans then dispatched their fleet from the Gulf of Corinth, under <a href="Teleutias">Teleutias</a>, to assist. After picking up more ships at Samos, Teleutias took command at Cnidus and commenced operations against Rhodes.

Alarmed by this Spartan naval resurgence, the Athenians sent out a fleet of 40 triremes under <a href="Thrasybulus">Thrasybulus</a>. He, judging that he could accomplish more by campaigning where the Spartan fleet was not than by challenging it directly, sailed to the <a href="Hellespont">Hellespont</a>. Once there, he won over several major states to the Athenian side and placed a duty on ships sailing past <a href="Byzantium">Byzantium</a>, restoring a source of revenue that the Athenians had relied on in the late Peloponnesian War. He then sailed to <a href="Lesbos%20Island">Lesbos</a>, where, with the support of the <a href="Mytilene">Mytilene</a>ans, he defeated the Spartan forces on the island and won over a number of cities. While still on Lesbos, however, Thrasybulus was killed by raiders from the city of Aspendus.

After this, the Spartans sent out a new commander, <a href="Anaxibius">Anaxibius</a>, to Abydos. For a time, he enjoyed a number of successes against Pharnabazus, and seized a number of Athenian merchant ships. Worried that Thrasybulus's accomplishments were being undermined, the Athenians sent Iphicrates to the region to confront Anaxibius. For a time, the two forces merely raided each other's territory, but eventually Iphicrates succeeded in guessing where Anaxibius would bring his troops on a return march from a campaign against <a href="Antandrus">Antandrus</a>, and ambushed the Spartan force. When Anaxibius and his men, who were strung out in the line of march, had entered the rough, mountainous terrain in which Iphicrates and his men were waiting, the Athenians emerged and ambushed them, killing Anaxibius and many others.

In 389 BC, the Athenians attacked the island of <a href="Aegina">Aegina</a>, off the coast of Attica. The Spartans soon drove off the Athenian fleet, but the Athenians continued their land assault. Under Antalcidas' command, the Spartan fleet sailed east to Rhodes but it was eventually blockaded at Abydos by the regional Athenian commanders. The Athenians on Aegina, meanwhile, soon found themselves under attack, and withdrew after several months.

Shortly thereafter, the Spartan fleet under <a href="Gorgopas%20%284th%20Century%20BC%29">Gorgopas</a> ambushed the Athenian fleet near Athens, capturing several ships. The Athenians responded with an ambush of their own; <a href="Chabrias">Chabrias</a>, on his way to Cyprus, landed his troops on Aegina and laid an ambush for the Aeginetans and their Spartan allies, killing a number of them including Gorgopas.

The Spartans then sent <a href="Teleutias">Teleutias</a> to Aegina to command the fleet there. Noticing that the Athenians had relaxed their guard after Chabrias's victory, he launched a raid on Piraeus, seizing numerous merchant ships.

<a href="Antalcidas">Antalcidas</a>, meanwhile, had entered into negotiations with <a href="Tiribazus">Tiribazus</a>, and reached an agreement under which the Persians would enter into the war on the Spartan side if the allies refused to make peace. It appears that the Persians, unnerved by certain of Athens' actions, including supporting king <a href="Evagoras%20I">Evagoras</a> of Cyprus and <a href="Hakor">Akoris</a> of <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, both of whom were at war with Persia, had decided that their policy of weakening Sparta by supporting its enemies was no longer useful. After escaping from the blockade at Abydos, Antalcidas attacked and defeated a small Athenian force, then united his fleet with a supporting fleet sent from <a href="Syracuse%2C%20Italy">Syracuse</a>. With this force, which was soon further augmented with ships supplied by the satraps of the region, he sailed to the Hellespont, where he could cut off the trade routes that brought grain to Athens. The Athenians, mindful of their similar defeat in the Peloponnesian War less than two decades before, were ready to make peace.

In this climate, when <a href="Tiribazus">Tiribazus</a> called a peace conference in late 387 BC, the major parties of the war were ready to discuss terms. The basic outline of the treaty was laid out by a decree from the Persian king <a href="Artaxerxes%20II%20of%20Persia">Artaxerxes</a>:
King Artaxerxes thinks it just that the cities in Asia should belong to him, as well as Clazomenae and Cyprus among the islands, and that the other Greek cities, both small and great, should be left independent, except Lemnos, Imbros, and Scyros; and these should belong, as of old, to the Athenians. But whichever of the two parties does not accept this peace, upon them I will make war, in company with those who desire this arrangement, both by land and by sea, with ships and with money.

According to the terms of this peace treaty:


In a general peace conference at Sparta, the Spartans, with their authority enhanced by the threat of Persian intervention, secured the acquiescence of all the major states of Greece to these terms. The terms were ratified by the city governments over the next year. The reassertion of Spartan hegemony over Greece by abandoning the Greeks of <a href="Aeolis">Aeolia</a>, <a href="Ionia">Ionia</a>, and <a href="Caria">Caria</a> has been called the "most disgraceful event in <a href="Greek%20history">Greek history</a>".

The agreement eventually produced was commonly known as the King's Peace, reflecting the Persian influence the treaty showed. This treaty placed Greece under Persian suzerainty and marked the first attempt at a <a href="Common%20Peace">Common Peace</a> in Greek history; under the treaty, all cities were to be independent, a clause that would be enforced by the Spartans as guardians of the peace. Under threat of Spartan intervention, Thebes disbanded its league, and Argos and Corinth ended their experiment in shared government; Corinth, deprived of its strong ally, was incorporated back into Sparta's <a href="Peloponnesian%20League">Peloponnesian League</a>. After 8 years of fighting, the Corinthian war was at an end.

In the years following the signing of the peace, the two states responsible for its structure, Persia and Sparta, took full advantage of the gains they had made. Persia, freed of both Athenian and Spartan interference in its Asian provinces, consolidated its hold over the eastern Aegean and captured both <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egypt</a> and Cyprus by 380 BC. Sparta, meanwhile, in its newly formalized position atop the Greek political system, took advantage of the autonomy clause of the peace to break up any coalition that it perceived as a threat. Disloyal allies were sharply punished—<a href="Mantinea">Mantinea</a>, for instance, was broken up into five component villages. With Agesilaus at the head of the state, advocating for an aggressive policy, the Spartans campaigned from the Peloponnese to the distant <a href="Chalcidice">Chalcidic peninsula</a>. Their dominance over mainland Greece would last another sixteen years before being shattered at <a href="Battle%20of%20Leuctra">Leuctra</a>.

The war also marked the beginning of Athens' resurgence as a power in the Greek world. With their walls and their fleet restored, the Athenians were in position to turn their eyes overseas. By the middle of the 4th century, they had assembled an organization of Aegean states commonly known as the <a href="Second%20Athenian%20League">Second Athenian League</a>, regaining at least parts of what they had lost with their defeat in 404 BC.

The freedom of the Ionian Greeks had been a rallying cry since the beginning of the 5th century, but after the Corinthian War, the mainland states made no further attempts to interfere with Persia's control of the region. After over a century of disruption and struggle, Persia at last ruled Ionia without disruption or intervention for over 50 years, until the time of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>.

M-28 (Michigan highway)

M-28 is an east–west <a href="Michigan%20Highway%20System">state trunkline highway</a> that traverses nearly all of the <a href="Upper%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Upper Peninsula</a> of the U.S. state of <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>, from <a href="Wakefield%2C%20Michigan">Wakefield</a> to near <a href="Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%2C%20Michigan">Sault Ste. Marie</a> in <a href="Bruce%20Township%2C%20Chippewa%20County%2C%20Michigan">Bruce Township</a>. Along with <a href="U.S.%20Route%202%20in%20Michigan">US Highway 2</a> (US 2), M-28 forms a pair of primary highways linking the Upper Peninsula from end to end, providing a major access route for traffic from Michigan and Canada along the southern shore of <a href="Lake%20Superior">Lake Superior</a>. M-28 is the longest state trunkline in Michigan numbered with the "M-" prefix at . The entire highway is listed on the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a>, while three sections of M-28 are part of the <a href="Lake%20Superior%20Circle%20Tour">Lake Superior Circle Tour</a>. M-28 also carries two memorial highway designations along its route.

Throughout its course across the Upper Peninsula, M-28 passes through forested woodlands, bog swamps, urbanized areas, and along the Lake Superior shoreline. Sections of roadway cross the <a href="Ottawa%20National%20Forest">Ottawa National Forest</a> and both units of the <a href="Hiawatha%20National%20Forest">Hiawatha National Forest</a>. Some of the other landmarks accessible from M-28 include the Seney Stretch, <a href="Seney%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge">Seney National Wildlife Refuge</a> and several historic bridges.

M-28 is an original trunkline designation, dating to the 1919 formation of the state's trunkline system. The original highway was much shorter than the current version. M-28 was expanded eastward to the Sault Ste. Marie area in the late 1920s. The western end has been expanded twice to different locations on the <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a> state line. Other changes along the routing have led to the creation of three different <a href="business%20loop">business loop</a>s at various times, with one still extant. Future changes, proposed by Marquette County but not accepted by the <a href="Michigan%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Michigan Department of Transportation</a> (MDOT), could see M-28 rerouted over County Road 480 (CR 480).

M-28 is a major highway for Michigan and Canadian traffic along the south shore of Lake Superior. It forms the northern half of a pair of primary trunklines linking the Upper Peninsula from end to end; <a href="U.S.%20Route%202%20in%20Michigan">US 2</a> is the southern partner. The highway comprises mostly two lanes, undivided except for sections that are <a href="Concurrency%20%28road%29">concurrent</a> with <a href="U.S.%20Route%2041%20in%20Michigan">US 41</a> near <a href="Marquette%2C%20Michigan">Marquette</a>. The "Marquette Bypass" portion of US 41/M-28 is a four-lane <a href="Limited-access%20road">expressway</a>, and segments of the highway in <a href="Marquette%20County%2C%20Michigan">Marquette County</a> have four lanes. The entire route is part of the National Highway System, and three sections of the trunkline are part of the Lake Superior Circle Tour.

In the west, M-28 begins at a signalized intersection with US 2 in Wakefield. Heading north, the highway passes Sunday Lake heading out of town. After crossing into southwestern <a href="Ontonagon%20County%2C%20Michigan">Ontonagon County</a> and the <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">Eastern Time Zone</a>, the trunkline highway skirts the northern shore of <a href="Lake%20Gogebic">Lake Gogebic</a>, running concurrently with <a href="M-64%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-64</a>. The first section of M-28 designated as a part of the Lake Superior Circle Tour is from the western terminus to the eastern junction with M-64 in <a href="Bergland%2C%20Michigan">Bergland</a>, where the Circle Tour turns north along M-64, leaving M-28. Here, M-28 has its lowest traffic counts; within the 2013 MDOT survey, the road is listed with only an <a href="average%20annual%20daily%20traffic">average annual daily traffic</a> (AADT) of 1,425 vehicles on a section of highway between Bergland and the <a href="U.S.%20Route%2045%20in%20Michigan">US 45</a> intersection in <a href="Bruce%20Crossing%2C%20Michigan">Bruce Crossing</a>. The trunkline runs through heavily forested areas of southern <a href="Houghton%20County%2C%20Michigan">Houghton</a> and <a href="Baraga%20County%2C%20Michigan">Baraga counties</a>. At the eastern junction with US 41 near Covington, M-28 receives the Circle Tour designation again and exits the <a href="Ottawa%20National%20Forest">Ottawa National Forest</a>.

In Baraga and Marquette counties, US 41/M-28 passes through hilly terrain before entering the urban areas of <a href="Ishpeming%2C%20Michigan">Ishpeming</a>, <a href="Negaunee%2C%20Michigan">Negaunee</a> and Marquette. Approximately 13,000–17,000 vehicles use this section from Ishpeming eastward through Negaunee. West of the city of Marquette, US 41/M-28 had a peak 2013 AADT of 32,805 vehicles in <a href="Marquette%20Township%2C%20Marquette%20County%2C%20Michigan">Marquette Township</a> along a retail and business corridor. This peak level is sustained until the start of the Marquette Bypass, where the traffic returns to the 16,500-vehicle and higher levels seen in Ishpeming and Negaunee. South of the city of Marquette, traffic counts once again climb to 19,620 vehicles. In <a href="Chocolay%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Chocolay Township</a> the AADT drops to 8,840 vehicles before tapering off to 3,065 vehicles by the county line.

At the Ishpeming–Negaunee city line, M-28 changes memorial highway designations. From the western terminus to this point, M-28 is called the "Veterans Memorial Highway", but it becomes the "D. J. Jacobetti Memorial Highway" to honor the longest-serving member of the <a href="Michigan%20Legislature">Michigan Legislature</a>, <a href="Dominic%20Jacobetti">Dominic J. Jacobetti</a>. The Jacobetti Highway designation ends at the eastern M-123 junction in <a href="Chippewa%20County%2C%20Michigan">Chippewa County</a>.
Between Marquette and <a href="Munising%2C%20Michigan">Munising</a>, M-28 closely parallels the Lake Superior shoreline, providing scenic views of the lake and its "lonesome sandy beaches". The Lakenenland Sculpture Park is located in <a href="Chocolay%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Chocolay Township</a> near Shot Point in eastern Marquette County. This roadside attraction is owned by Tom Lakenen and features fanciful works of art made of scrap iron. Near the community of <a href="Au%20Train%2C%20Michigan">Au Train</a>, M-28 crosses into the western unit of the <a href="Hiawatha%20National%20Forest">Hiawatha National Forest</a>. West of Munising is a ferry dock offering transport to the <a href="Grand%20Island%20National%20Recreation%20Area">Grand Island National Recreation Area</a>, and at Munising there is easy access to <a href="Pictured%20Rocks%20National%20Lakeshore">Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore</a>. The roadway also features <a href="variable-message%20sign">variable-message sign</a>s to warn motorists of winter weather-related traffic closures along the lakeshore. Installed at the US 41 and <a href="M-94%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-94</a> junctions, the signs advise motorists which sections of roadway are closed. Per MDOT policy, only <a href="Winter%20service%20vehicle">snowplows</a> are allowed on these sections during a closure. The highway exits the Hiawatha National Forest at the <a href="Alger%20County%2C%20Michigan">Alger County</a>–<a href="Schoolcraft%20County%2C%20Michigan">Schoolcraft County</a> line along the Seney Stretch.

The portion of M-28 between <a href="Seney%2C%20Michigan">Seney</a> and <a href="Shingleton%2C%20Michigan">Shingleton</a>, called the Seney Stretch, is of "straight-as-an-arrow highway" across the <a href="Seney%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge">Great Manistique Swamp</a>, "though others claim it's , only because it seems longer." The Seney Stretch is the longest such section of highway in the state, and "one of the longest stretches of curveless highway east of the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi</a>." The highway is often cited as the "state's most boring route" according to the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) and "Hunts' Guide". The straightness and flatness over a great distance are given as reasons for the reputation of this stretch as boring.

The road across the swamp was constructed parallel to the line of the <a href="Duluth%2C%20South%20Shore%20and%20Atlantic%20Railway">Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railway</a> (later the <a href="Soo%20Line%20Railroad">Soo Line Railroad</a>). It was first numbered as a part of <a href="M-25%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-25</a> when that designation was used along today's M-28 east of US 41. The most significant changes made to the stretch since its original construction were the addition of <a href="Passing%20lane">passing relief lanes</a> and a full-scale, year-round <a href="rest%20area">rest area</a> in 1999.

Part of the Seney Stretch forms the northern border of the <a href="Seney%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge">Seney National Wildlife Refuge</a>. Established in 1935, this refuge is a managed <a href="wetland">wetland</a> in <a href="Schoolcraft%20County%2C%20Michigan">Schoolcraft County</a>. It has an area of , and contains the Strangmoor Bog <a href="National%20Natural%20Landmark">National Natural Landmark</a> within its boundaries.

Past Seney, M-28 once again enters woodlands on the eastern end of the Upper Peninsula. In <a href="Luce%20County%2C%20Michigan">Luce County</a>, the roadway passes through the community of <a href="McMillan%20Township%2C%20Luce%20County%2C%20Michigan">McMillan</a> en route to <a href="Newberry%2C%20Michigan">Newberry</a>. The Circle Tour departs M-28 to follow <a href="M-123%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-123</a> at Newberry, looping north to the <a href="Tahquamenon%20Falls%20State%20Park">Tahquamenon Falls State Park</a>. East of town, the road passes Luce County Airport off of Luce CR 399. From there, M-28 crosses the east and west branches of the Sage River and passes south of <a href="McMillan%20Township%2C%20Luce%20County%2C%20Michigan">Soo Junction</a>, before the <a href="Chippewa%20County%2C%20Michigan">Chippewa County</a> border.

In Chippewa County, M-28 begins bending slightly east-northeastward. Hulbert Lake is located south of <a href="Hulbert%2C%20Michigan">Hulbert</a>; north of the lake, the highway enters the eastern unit of the Hiawatha National Forest. At the eastern junction of M-28 and M-123 near <a href="Eckerman%2C%20Michigan">Eckerman</a> and <a href="Strongs%2C%20Michigan">Strongs</a>, the Circle Tour returns to M-28 and the D.J. Jacobetti Memorial Highway designation ends. The highway leaves the eastern unit of the Hiawatha National Forest between the communities of <a href="Raco%2C%20Michigan">Raco</a> and <a href="Brimley%2C%20Michigan">Brimley</a>. <a href="M-221%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-221</a> leads north from the main highway on an old routing of M-28 to connect to the community of Brimley and the <a href="Bay%20Mills%20Indian%20Community">Bay Mills Indian Community</a>. <a href="Brimley%20State%20Park">Brimley State Park</a> is just east of Brimley on the old 6 Mile Road alignment of M-28. The highway meets <a href="Interstate%2075%20in%20Michigan">I-75</a> at exit 386, and the Lake Superior Circle Tour departs M-28 to follow I-75. This interchange is just west of <a href="H-63%20%28Michigan%20county%20highway%29">H-63</a>/<a href="Mackinac%20Trail">Mackinac Trail</a>, a former segment of US 2. M-28 continues farther to its eastern terminus with <a href="M-129%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-129</a>.

Along the routing of M-28, MDOT has established several roadside parks and rest areas. Two of these are in Ontonagon County near <a href="Ewen%2C%20Michigan">Ewen</a> and <a href="Trout%20Creek%2C%20Michigan">Trout Creek</a>. A park with a picnic area and a footbridge lies near Tioga Creek in <a href="Baraga%20County%2C%20Michigan">Baraga County</a> east of the US 41 junction. In <a href="Michigamme%2C%20Michigan">Michigamme</a> a scenic turnout and a roadside park overlook <a href="Lake%20Michigamme">Lake Michigamme</a>, and along Lake Superior south of Marquette is a tourist information center built as a log cabin. East of the <a href="H-01%20%28Michigan%20county%20highway%29">H-01</a> junction in <a href="Au%20Train%2C%20Michigan">Au Train</a> is a roadside park that includes <a href="Scott%20Falls">Scott Falls</a>. Further east, a year-round rest area is located on the western end of the Seney Stretch. Three other roadside parks lie east of Harvey in <a href="Shelter%20Bay%2C%20Michigan">Shelter Bay</a>, on the shores of Deer Lake and west of Newberry.

Formed by July 1, 1919, M-28 began in <a href="Wakefield%2C%20Michigan">Wakefield</a> at a junction with then <a href="M-12%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-12</a> and ran roughly along the current alignment to end at <a href="M-15%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-15</a>, east of <a href="Covington%2C%20Michigan">Covington</a>. These two termini roughly correspond to the modern <a href="U.S.%20Route%202%20in%20Michigan">US 2</a> and western <a href="U.S.%20Route%2041%20in%20Michigan">US 41</a> junctions respectively. M-28 was extended in 1927 along US 41 into <a href="Marquette%20County%2C%20Michigan">Marquette County</a> and east over <a href="M-25%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-25</a> through <a href="Chatham%2C%20Michigan">Chatham</a>, <a href="Munising%2C%20Michigan">Munising</a>, and <a href="Newberry%2C%20Michigan">Newberry</a>, before ending in downtown <a href="Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%2C%20Michigan">Sault Ste. Marie</a>. At Negaunee, M-28 took the former routing of M-15 between <a href="Negaunee%2C%20Michigan">Negaunee</a> and <a href="Marquette%2C%20Michigan">Marquette</a> for while US 41 ran along a portion of <a href="M-35%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-35</a>. This southern loop routing of M-28 lasted until approximately 1936, when M-28 was moved to US 41, and the former route became <a href="County%20Road%20492%20%28Marquette%20County%2C%20Michigan%29">CR 492</a>. A new routing of M-28 in the Newberry area opened later that year, and a new M-28A (later <a href="M-28%20Business%20%28Newberry%2C%20Michigan%29">Bus. M-28</a>) existed until 1953. Another realignment in 1937 marked the transfer of M-28 out of downtown <a href="Ishpeming%2C%20Michigan">Ishpeming</a> and Negaunee. This former routing later became <a href="M-28%20Business%20%28Ishpeming-Negaunee%2C%20Michigan%29">Bus. M-28</a>.
In the late 1930s, a highway numbered M-178 was designated between M-28 south of Munising to M-94 in town. In 1941, the routings of M-28 and <a href="M-94%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-94</a> were reversed between <a href="Harvey%2C%20Michigan">Harvey</a> and Munising, and M-28 supplanted the M-178 designation completely. Since then, M-28 has run along the lakeshore through <a href="Au%20Train%2C%20Michigan">Au Train</a>. M-28 was extended along US 2 to the state line at <a href="Ironwood%2C%20Michigan">Ironwood</a>, and the eastern end of M-28 through <a href="Brimley%2C%20Michigan">Brimley</a> was moved to a new alignment ending at US 2, in <a href="Dafter%2C%20Michigan">Dafter</a> in 1942. The eastern end was moved along US 2 back to Sault Ste. Marie in 1948, though the terminus was returned to Dafter in 1950.
From 1952 to 1962, M-28 crossed US 2 at Wakefield going south and stopped at the <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a> border, connecting with a county road. This segment of the highway (now Gogebic CR 519) was transferred back to the county in 1962. M-94 previously looped along Munising-Van Meer-Shingleton Road (now <a href="H-58%20%28Michigan%20county%20highway%29">H-58</a> and <a href="H-15%20%28Michigan%20county%20highway%29">H-15</a>) north of M-28 between Munising and Shingleton. This routing was abandoned on November 7, 1963 in favor of the current <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">concurrency</a>. The last significant change to the M-28 routing occurred on March 3, 1989, when the eastern terminus was moved east to <a href="M-129%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-129</a>.
MDOT unveiled plans on March 31, 2009, to rebuild the intersection between Front Street and the eastern end of the Marquette Bypass during 2010. The previous intersection configuration dated back to the 1960s and had been labeled as "dangerous and [causing] significant traffic delays" by the designers of the replacement. A traffic study concluded in 2007 that the intersection would need either the roundabout or a traffic signal with several turning lanes to accommodate the traffic needs in the area. MDOT decided in favor of a two-lane, roundabout retaining the right-turn lanes from the previous intersection layout. These lanes will be used by right-turning traffic to bypass the circle at the center of the intersection.

Construction started on the project in May. A section of the intersection was opened in July to traffic from the south that turns west. The lanes northbound into downtown were opened in the beginning of August, and the city held a ribbon cutting ceremony on August 19, 2010. The remaining lanes were opened the next day.

MDOT has highlighted five <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">historic</a> bridges along the route of M-28 on the MDOT website. In <a href="Interior%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Interior Township</a>, <a href="Ontonagon%20County%2C%20Michigan">Ontonagon County</a>, the highway crosses the <a href="Ontonagon%20River">Ontonagon River</a> over a bridge built in 1929. Designed by the State Highway Department and built by the firm of Meads and Anderson, the Ontonagon River Bridge is one of only three <a href="Arch%20bridges">steel arch</a> bridges in Michigan. The main span arch is long. A former routing of M-28 in <a href="Covington%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Covington Township</a> crosses the Rock River. Although this section was bypassed by a new alignment of the trunkline in 1924, the bridge remains complete "with corbeled bulkheads and six panels recessed in the concrete spandrel walls." The <a href="corbel">corbel</a>s and <a href="spandrel">spandrel</a>s are decorative features found in the concrete sides of the bridge.

Today, drivers cannot use the <a href="Trunk%20Line%20Bridge%20No.%201">Peshekee River Bridge</a> south of US 41/M-28 in western <a href="Marquette%20County%2C%20Michigan">Marquette County</a>'s <a href="Michigamme%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Michigamme Township</a>. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999 as "Trunk Line Bridge No. 1" for its engineering and architectural significance. MDOT has listed it as "one of Michigan's most important vehicular bridges." It was the first bridge designed by the Michigan State Highway Department, the forerunner to MDOT, in 1914. It was bypassed by a newer bridge built over the Peshekee River on US 41/M-28 subsequently abandoned as a roadway. The replacement bridge was bypassed and demolished in 1995.

The next historic bridge listed by MDOT along M-28 is <a href="M-28%E2%80%93Sand%20River%20Bridge">over the Sand River</a> in <a href="Onota%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Onota Township</a> in <a href="Alger%20County%2C%20Michigan">Alger County</a>. While not visible to motorists, the bridge, constructed in 1939, is the longest rural rigid-frame span in Michigan. Most bridges of this type were built in urban locations, and soil conditions in the state limit locations for this style of bridge. The <a href="M-28%E2%80%93Tahquamenon%20River%20Bridge">bridge</a> over the East Branch of the <a href="Tahquamenon%20River">Tahquamenon River</a> in <a href="Chippewa%20County%2C%20Michigan">Chippewa County</a> was built in 1926 as a "formative exercise in what would evolve into a state standard design." The bridge was built with nine lines of <a href="I-beam">I-beam</a>s encased in concrete. Only one other bridge in Michigan was built with such concrete encasement.

In the August 24, 2005 edition, the <a href="Marquette%2C%20Michigan">Marquette</a> "Mining Journal" reported that the <a href="Marquette%20County%2C%20Michigan">Marquette County</a> Board and the County Road Commission were negotiating with MDOT to transfer the jurisdiction of Marquette County Road 480 to the state. Several routing options have been discussed, though all would make CR 480 a part of M-28. Cost was the primary reason given behind rerouting M-28 along CR 480. "The road commission receives about $50,000 a year in state gas tax money but spends about $100,000 to maintain CR 480 because of the type and volume of traffic it receives." Handing CR 480 over to the state would shift the maintenance costs to the state, as well.

MDOT has indicated that it has not requested jurisdiction, but rather if it assumed control of the route, the community would need to support a through-route. Several proposals have arisen, including creating a "spur" from US 41/M-28 through the east end of Ishpeming to meet CR 480 west of Negaunee. This spur would pass through recently reopened former mining "caving grounds", and to the south of the Mather A & B Mine complex. According to Gerry Corkin, Marquette County Board Chairman, "the land that was purchased by Ishpeming and Negaunee, the mining company land, this has the potential to help in the development of that if this is compatible. I think both cities will be interested in taking a look at what the land uses are and where this [spur] would push through."

The spur proposal would open land to development between the downtown areas of the two cities. If jurisdiction is transferred, and M-28 is routed over CR 480 as proposed, M-28 would leave the concurrency with US 41 near <a href="Teal%20Lake%20%28Michigan%29">Teal Lake</a> in Negaunee, and cross the caving grounds west of downtown to connect to Rail Street. Rail Street would serve as the connector to CR 480, which ends at the intersection of Rail and Ann streets and Healey Avenue. Proposals indicate two routing options for the east end of CR 480. One would route M-28 back along US 41 from Beaver Grove north of the CR 480 eastern terminus to the existing M-28 in Harvey. A second would route it along CR 551/Cherry Creek Road from CR 480 to M-28 in Harvey.

There have been three <a href="business%20loop">business loop</a>s for M-28: Ishpeming–Negaunee, Marquette and Newberry. Only the business loop serving Ishpeming and Negaunee is still a state-maintained trunkline. US 41/M-28 was relocated to bypass the two cities' downtowns in 1937. The highway through downtown Ishpeming and Negaunee later carried the ALT US 41/ALT M-28 designation before being designated Bus. M-28 in 1958. The western end of the business loop was transferred to local government control when Bus. M-28 was moved along Lakeshore Drive in 1999.
Bus. US 41 in Marquette was first shown on a map in 1964 after the construction of the Marquette Bypass. It was later designated Bus. US 41/Bus. M-28 on a map in 1975; this second designation was removed from maps by 1982. The entire business loop was turned back to local control in a "route swap" between the City of Marquette and MDOT announced in early 2005. The proposal transferred jurisdiction on the unsigned <a href="M-554%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-554</a> and the business route from the state to the city. The state would take jurisdiction over a segment of McClellan Avenue to be used to extend <a href="M-553%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-553</a> to US 41/M-28. In addition, MDOT would pay $2.5 million (equivalent to $ in ) for reconstruction work planned for 2007. The transfer would increase Marquette's operational and maintenance liability expenses by $26,000 (equivalent to $ in ) and place the financial burden of the future replacement of a stop light on the city. On October 10, 2005, MDOT and Marquette transferred jurisdiction over the three roadways. As a result, Bus. US 41 was decommissioned when the local government took control over Washington and Front streets. As a result of the decommissioning, the 2006 maps did not show the now former business loop.

The Newberry Bus. M-28 was designated from 1936 until 1952 as M-28A. The MSHD maps of the time showed it signed as Bus. M-28 in 1952 before it was turned back to local control in 1953.

Ravenloft (module)

Ravenloft is an <a href="Adventure%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">adventure module</a> for the "<a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons">Dungeons & Dragons</a>" ("D&D") fantasy <a href="role-playing%20game">role-playing game</a>. The American game publishing company <a href="TSR%2C%20Inc.">TSR, Inc.</a> released it as a standalone adventure booklet in 1983 for use with the <a href="Editions%20of%20Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%23Advanced%20Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons">first edition</a> "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" game. It was written by <a href="Tracy%20Hickman">Tracy</a> and <a href="Laura%20Hickman">Laura Hickman</a>, and includes art by <a href="Clyde%20Caldwell">Clyde Caldwell</a> with maps by <a href="David%20C.%20Sutherland%20III">David Sutherland III</a>. The plot of "Ravenloft" focuses on the villain <a href="Strahd%20von%20Zarovich">Strahd von Zarovich</a>, a <a href="Vampire%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">vampire</a> who pines for his lost love. Various story elements, including Strahd's motivation and the locations of <a href="Magic%20item%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">magical weapons</a>, are randomly determined by drawing cards. The <a href="player%20character">player character</a>s attempt to defeat Strahd and, if successful, the adventure ends.

The Hickmans began work on "Ravenloft" in the late 1970s, intent on creating a frightening portrait of a vampire in a setting that combined <a href="Gothic%20fiction">Gothic horror</a> with the "D&D" game system. They play-tested the adventure with a group of players each Halloween for five years before it was published. Strahd has since appeared in a number of "D&D" accessories and novels. The module has inspired numerous revisions and adaptations, including a <a href="campaign%20setting">campaign setting</a> of <a href="Ravenloft">the same name</a> and a sequel. In 1999, on the 25th anniversary of "Dungeons & Dragons", two commemorative versions of "Ravenloft" were released.

"Ravenloft" has won one award, been included on two "best of" lists, and was generally well received by critics of its era. In 1984, it won the Strategists' Club Award for Outstanding Play Aid, and it appeared second in "<a href="Dungeon%20%28magazine%29">Dungeon</a>" magazine's list of the top 30 "D&D" adventures. Several reviewers liked the included maps, and "<a href="White%20Dwarf%20%28magazine%29">White Dwarf</a>" magazine gave it 8 out of 10 overall. A "<a href="Dragon%20%28magazine%29">Dragon</a>" magazine review praised the module, but felt that the "D&D" elements detracted from the Gothic horror atmosphere. In 2016, Wizards of the Coast published "Curse of Strahd", an adaptation of the original Ravenloft module for the 5th edition of "Dungeons & Dragons."

The story involves a <a href="Party%20%28role%20playing%20games%29">party</a> of <a href="player%20character">player character</a>s (PCs) who travel to the land of <a href="Barovia">Barovia</a>, a small nation surrounded by a deadly magical fog. The master of nearby <a href="Castle">Castle</a> Ravenloft, Count <a href="Strahd%20von%20Zarovich">Strahd von Zarovich</a>, tyrannically rules the country, and a prologue explains that the residents must barricade their doors each night to avoid attacks by Strahd and his minions. The <a href="Burgomaster">Burgomaster</a>'s mansion is the focus of these attacks, and, for reasons that are not initially explained, Strahd is after the Burgomaster's adopted daughter, Ireena Kolyana.

Before play begins, the <a href="Dungeon%20Master">Dungeon Master</a> (or DM, the player who organizes and directs the game play) randomly draws five cards from a deck of six. Two of these cards determine the locations of two <a href="Magic%20item%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29%23Weapons%20and%20armor">magical weapons</a> useful in defeating Strahd: the Holy Symbol and the Sunsword. The next two cards determine the locations of Strahd and the "Tome of Strahd", a book that details Strahd's long-ago <a href="unrequited%20love">unrequited love</a>. In this work, it is revealed that Strahd had fallen in love with a young girl, who in turn loved his younger brother. Strahd blamed his age for the rejection, and made a pact with evil powers to live forever. He then slew his brother, but the young girl killed herself in response, and Strahd found that he had become a vampire. All six possible locations are inside Castle Ravenloft.

The fifth and final card selected determines Strahd's motivation. There are four possible motivations for Strahd. He may want to replace one of the PCs and attempt to turn the character into a vampire and take on that character's form. He may desire the love of Ireena, whose appearance matches that of his lost love, Tatyana. Using <a href="mind%20control">mind control</a>, Strahd will try to force a PC to attack Ireena and gain her love by "saving" her from the situation he created. Strahd may also want to create an evil magic item, or destroy the Sunsword. If, during play, the party's fortune is told at the <a href="Romani%20people">gypsy</a> camp in Barovia, the random elements are altered to match the cards drawn by the gypsy.

As the party journeys through Barovia and the castle, the game play is guided using 12 maps with corresponding sections in the book's body guide. Example maps and sections include the Lands of Barovia, the Court of the Count, five entries for each level of the <a href="Spire">Spire</a>s of Ravenloft, and the Dungeons and Catacombs. Each location contains treasure and adversaries, including <a href="Zombie%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">zombies</a>, <a href="wolf">wolves</a>, <a href="Ghoul%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">ghouls</a>, <a href="Ghost%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">ghosts</a>, and other creatures. The main objective of the game is to destroy Count Strahd. The DM is instructed to play the vampire intelligently, and to keep him alive as long as possible, making him flee when necessary. In an optional epilogue, Ireena is reunited with her lover. They leave the "mortal world" as Ireena says, "Through these many centuries we have played out the tragedy of our lives."

Tracy Hickman and Laura Curtis married in 1977. Soon after, while living in <a href="Provo%2C%20Utah">Provo, Utah</a>, they wrote the adventures "<a href="Desert%20of%20Desolation%23Pharaoh">Pharaoh</a>" and "Ravenloft". When they began work on "Ravenloft", they felt the vampire archetype had become overused, trite, and mundane, and decided to create a frightening version of the creature for the module. They play-tested it with a group of players every <a href="Halloween">Halloween</a> for five years before it was published in 1983 by TSR. The plot combined elements of the <a href="horror%20fiction">horror</a> genre with "Dungeons & Dragons" conventions for the first time. At the time of "Ravenloft"'s release, each "Dungeons & Dragons" module was marked with an <a href="alphanumeric">alphanumeric</a> code indicating the series to which it belonged. "Ravenloft" was labeled I6: the sixth in a <a href="List%20of%20Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%20modules%23I">series of intermediate-level modules</a> for the <a href="Editions%20of%20Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%23Advanced%20Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons">first edition</a> of "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" ("AD&D"). It consisted of a 32-page book, with separate maps that detailed locations in the adventure scenario.

Tracy Hickman once ran the adventure as a Dungeon Master. According to him, the experience was like an old <a href="Horror%20film">scary movie</a>, with "the obligatory castle high on the craggy cliff with the wolves howling in the woods. Sure enough, the vampire was up there in the castle. To most of the players it seemed like a straight forward task: find the vampire and kill him." One player discovered Strahd's backstory and was so affected by it that when it came time to kill the vampire at the end of the adventure, despite having a sword capable of dispatching Strahd, he refused, and his companions were forced to complete the task. Afterwards, Hickman asked him why. "He deserved to die better than that," his friend said, to which Hickman replied "Yes [...] But that is how it is with people who fall from greatness. He chose his end when he first chose to kill his brother. How could it be any different?".

According to a Wizards of the Coast article, Strahd has become one of the most infamous and well-known villains in the "Dungeons & Dragons" game, and he has appeared in a number of novels and rulebooks since his debut in "Ravenloft". In an introduction to an online edition of "Ravenloft II", author <a href="John%20D.%20Rateliff">John D. Rateliff</a> described Strahd as a then-unusual fusion of a monster with the abilities of a player <a href="Character%20class%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">character class</a>; that is, a <a href="vampire%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">vampire</a> <a href="wizard%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">magic-user</a>. This design enables him to combine his own powers with the surrounding environment, making him a difficult opponent to defeat.

To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the "Dungeons & Dragons" game in 1999, two additional versions of the "Ravenloft" module were released. The first was a reprinting of the original adventure made available in the "Dungeons & Dragons Silver Anniversary Collector's Edition" <a href="boxed%20set">boxed set</a>, with slight modifications to make it distinguishable from the original (for collecting purposes). The second was the silver anniversary edition of "Ravenloft" that was adapted for use with the second edition "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" (Wizards of the Coast periodically alters the rules of Dungeons & Dragons and releases a new version).

"Ravenloft's" success led to a sequel in 1986 titled Ravenloft II: The House on Gryphon Hill. Although Tracy Hickman was credited in "Ravenloft II", he had left TSR before the module was completed. The writing was done by <a href="David%20Cook%20%28game%20designer%29">David "Zeb" Cook</a>, <a href="Jeff%20Grubb">Jeff Grubb</a>, <a href="Harold%20Johnson%20%28game%20designer%29">Harold Johnson</a>, and <a href="Douglas%20Niles">Douglas Niles</a>, following the Hickmans' outline. Each writer pursued a different section of the module in order to meet the deadline. <a href="Clyde%20Caldwell">Clyde Caldwell</a>, who had done all of the art for the original "Ravenloft" module, provided the cover, but interior art was done by <a href="Jeff%20Easley">Jeff Easley</a>. The adventure is designed for first edition "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" characters of levels 8–10. The adventure was 48 pages, and included a large color map and an outer folder. It shared structural elements with the original, including variable NPC goals and variable locations for key objects, so that "Gryphon Hill" plays differently each time. The module's plot features an <a href="Magic%20item%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29%23Artifacts">artifact</a> known as "The Apparatus" that switches a monster's personality with that of an ordinary townsperson; player characters, therefore, are uncertain about the true identity of the people they meet. The module also introduces <a href="Azalin%20Rex">Azalin</a> the <a href="Lich%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">lich</a>, who later became a major character in the Ravenloft campaign setting. This module is playable alone, or as a sequel to the original "Ravenloft". It includes descriptions of the town of Mordentshire, as well as some haunted moors, and a manor house, all mapped in perspective like the original module.

In 1986, "Ravenloft" was adapted into the <a href="gamebook">gamebook</a> "Master of Ravenloft", #6 in the "<a href="Advanced%20Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%20Adventure%20Gamebooks">Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Adventure Gamebooks</a>" series. In the book, the reader plays the role of Jeren Sureblade, a <a href="Paladin%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">paladin</a>, who must defeat Count Strahd von Zarovich to save a young girl from becoming one of the undead. The gamebook was written by <a href="Jean%20Blashfield%20Black">Jean Blashfield</a>, with cover art by <a href="Clyde%20Caldwell">Clyde Caldwell</a> and interior art by Gary Williams.

"Ravenloft" inspired a <a href="campaign%20setting%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">campaign setting</a> of <a href="Ravenloft">the same name</a>, published in 1990. The "" boxed set was published as part of the <a href="Editions%20of%20Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%23Advanced%20Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%202nd%20edition">second edition</a> of "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" and, according to its back cover, it is "rooted in the Gothic tradition" and contains "tips for adding fear to your games". The setting of the module was expanded; Ravenloft is now a <a href="demiplane">demiplane</a> (an <a href="Parallel%20universe%20%28fiction%29">alternate dimension</a>). The boxed set's version of Strahd is similar to character in the original adventure, but his abilities were increased and his background explained in more detail. The campaign setting has produced a number of spin-offs, and this new version of Strahd was used as a major character in a number of novels.

The original "Ravenloft" module has been revised and expanded three times. In 1993, TSR published "<a href="House%20of%20Strahd">House of Strahd</a>" (module code RM4). It was updated to include rules from the second edition of "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons". The module credits the original work by the Hickmans, but was revised by <a href="Bruce%20Nesmith">Bruce Nesmith</a>, who along with <a href="Andria%20Hayday">Andria Hayday</a> created the "Ravenloft" campaign setting. Nesmith introduced some new creatures, developed Strahd's tactics further, and added a Time-Track Table so that the referee can anticipate the sunset. In October 2006, <a href="Wizards%20of%20the%20Coast">Wizards of the Coast</a> released an updated and expanded version of the original module for "Dungeons & Dragons" <a href="Editions%20of%20Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%23Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%20v3.5">version 3.5</a> as a 226-page hardcover book entitled "Expedition to Castle Ravenloft". It was based on the original module, and not the "Ravenloft" material made in the intervening years. "Expedition to Castle Ravenloft" is designed to be played as a mini-campaign lasting about 20 game sessions, much longer than the original module, although it contains options for running long 8-session or short 4-session adventures. The book also includes suggestions for incorporating the adventure into an existing generic setting, <a href="Forgotten%20Realms">Forgotten Realms</a>, <a href="Eberron">Eberron</a> or <a href="d20%20Modern">d20 Modern</a> campaign. Wizards of the Coast released the board game "<a href="Castle%20Ravenloft%20Board%20Game">Castle Ravenloft</a>" in 2010 as part of the "Adventure System" series of board games using a simplified 4th edition rule set. In 2016, Wizards of the Coast published "Curse of Strahd", an adaptation of the original Ravenloft module for the 5th edition of "Dungeons & Dragons", which was generally well received, earning the 2016 ENnie Awards for Best Adventure and Best Art/Cover and runner up for Product of the Year.

"Ravenloft" won one award, and was included on two "best of" lists. In 1984, it won the Strategists' Club Award for Outstanding Play Aid. The book "Dungeon Master For Dummies" chose the module as one of the ten best classic adventures, saying it is "perhaps our favorite "D&D" adventure of all time", "Ravenloft" "takes the Dracula legend and gives it a "D&D" spin", and praised the detailed yet concise plot and <a href="Isometric%20projection">isometric maps</a>. The book also claims that Ravenloft "inspired game designers and Dungeon Masters to take the art of adventure to the next level."

In 2004, on the 30th anniversary of the "Dungeons & Dragons" game, "<a href="Dungeon%20%28magazine%29">Dungeon</a>" magazine ranked the module as the second greatest "Dungeons & Dragons" adventure of all time—behind "<a href="Queen%20of%20the%20Spiders">Queen of the Spiders</a>". The editor of "Dungeon" praised the placement of treasure, and Strahd's motivation was described as "a brilliant way to let fate drive the plot and evoke the mystery and mystique of Barovia". <a href="Bill%20Slavicsek">Bill Slavicsek</a>, director of Wizards of the Coast's RPGs and Miniatures department, noted that it was the first adventure to "mix tone, story, and dungeon crawl" in a module, and game designer <a href="Andy%20Collins%20%28game%20designer%29">Andy Collins</a> agreed. <a href="Clark%20Peterson%20%28game%20designer%29">Clark Peterson</a>, president of <a href="Necromancer%20Games">Necromancer Games</a>, singled out the maps and Strahd for praise, saying the vampire is "perhaps one of the best villains of all time". Author <a href="John%20D.%20Rateliff">John Rateliff</a> also applauded the maps and the randomization, as well as Strahd's duality as a vampire/magic-user. The catacombs, where player characters were teleported away and replaced with undead <a href="Wight%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">wights</a>, was singled out at as the adventure's "defining moment" by the magazine's editors.

Reviews for "Ravenloft" were generally positive. <a href="Rick%20Swan">Rick Swan</a> reviewed the adventure in "<a href="The%20Space%20Gamer">The Space Gamer</a>" No. 72. He commented that there was "so much gothic atmosphere in "Ravenloft" that if it had any more, it'd flap its pages and fly away", and stated that the bulk of the adventure involving a search of Castle Ravenloft was "not too interesting" with encounters few and far between, and that the mechanic of using a regular deck of cards to simulate a gypsy fortune teller was "silly and the results are too arbitrary" but concluded that ""Ravenloft" is such a refreshing change that even with its problems, it's recommended." In the July 1984 issue of "<a href="White%20Dwarf%20%28magazine%29">White Dwarf</a>" magazine, the module was given 8 out of 10 overall, with the reviewer mentioning its presentation as a positive, and its complexity as a negative. It was likened to a <a href="Hammer%20Film%20Productions">Hammer horror production</a> and praised as enjoyable, although the reviewer said the game's puns were tedious and detracted from the spooky atmosphere. "White Dwarf" reviewer <a href="Dave%20Morris%20%28writer%29">Dave Morris</a> said it "should be a lot of fun – 'light, relief' of a nerve-wracking and deadly sort" and concluded that "Ravenloft" is "full of clever touches", and "features some first-class illustration and graphics". In a review for the January 1984 issue of "<a href="Dragon%20%28magazine%29">Dragon</a>" magazine (published by a subsidiary of TSR), game designer <a href="Ken%20Rolston">Ken Rolston</a> argued that, despite its design innovations, "Ravenloft" was still in essence a <a href="dungeon%20crawl">dungeon-style adventure</a>. Rolston praised the randomization, the maps, and the player text (which is read aloud to the players by the DM). He said the player text "consistently develops an atmosphere of darkness and decay." Despite this, Rolston felt that the adventure has trouble in developing a frightening tone. He singles out its use of common monsters in "D&D", an abundance of traps, and frequent combat interludes as elements that detract from the adventure's spookiness by interrupting the module's flow. Ultimately, he felt that in "AD&D terms it is a masterpiece", but not a work of "Gothic horror". Tracy Hickman stated in 1998, "I still believe the original Ravenloft modules were perhaps the best that ever had my name on them."

Treaty of Devol

The Treaty of Devol () was an agreement made in 1108 between <a href="Bohemond%20I%20of%20Antioch">Bohemond I</a> of <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a> and <a href="Byzantine%20Emperor">Byzantine Emperor</a> <a href="Alexios%20I%20Komnenos">Alexios I Komnenos</a>, in the wake of the <a href="First%20Crusade">First Crusade</a>. It is named after the Byzantine fortress of <a href="Devol%20%28Albania%29">Devol</a> (in modern <a href="Albania">Albania</a>). Although the treaty was not immediately enforced, it was intended to make the <a href="Principality%20of%20Antioch">Principality of Antioch</a> a <a href="vassal">vassal</a> state of the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>.

At the beginning of the <a href="First%20Crusade">First Crusade</a>, <a href="Crusade">Crusade</a>r armies assembled at <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> and promised to return to the Byzantine Empire any land they might conquer. However, Bohemond, the son of Alexios' former enemy <a href="Robert%20Guiscard">Robert Guiscard</a>, claimed the <a href="Principality%20of%20Antioch">Principality of Antioch</a> for himself. Alexios did not recognize the legitimacy of the Principality, and Bohemond went to Europe looking for reinforcements. He launched into open warfare against Alexios, <a href="Siege%20of%20Dyrrhachium%20%281107%E2%80%931108%29">laying siege</a> to <a href="Dyrrhachium">Dyrrhachium</a>, but he was soon forced to surrender and negotiate with Alexios at the imperial camp at Diabolis (Devol), where the Treaty was signed.

Under the terms of the Treaty, Bohemond agreed to become a vassal of the Emperor and to defend the Empire whenever needed. He also accepted the appointment of a <a href="Greek%20Patriarch%20of%20Antioch">Greek Patriarch</a>. In return, he was given the titles of "<a href="sebastos">sebastos</a>" and "<a href="dux">doux</a>" (duke) of Antioch, and he was guaranteed the right to pass on to his heirs the <a href="County%20of%20Edessa">County of Edessa</a>. Following this, Bohemond retreated to <a href="Apulia">Apulia</a> and died there. His nephew, <a href="Tancred%2C%20Prince%20of%20Galilee">Tancred</a>, who was regent in Antioch, refused to accept the terms of the Treaty. Antioch came temporarily under Byzantine sway in 1137, but it was not until 1158 that it truly became a Byzantine vassal.

The Treaty of Devol is viewed as a typical example of the Byzantine tendency to settle disputes through <a href="Byzantine%20diplomacy">diplomacy</a> rather than warfare, and was both a result of and a cause for the distrust between the Byzantines and their <a href="Western%20Europe">Western Europe</a>an neighbors.

In 1097, the Crusader armies assembled at Constantinople having traveled in groups eastward through Europe. Alexios I, who had requested only some western knights to serve as <a href="mercenary">mercenaries</a> to help fight the <a href="Seljuk%20Turks">Seljuk Turks</a>, blockaded these armies in the city and would not permit them to leave until their leaders swore <a href="oath">oath</a>s promising to restore to the Empire any land formerly belonging to it that they might conquer on the way to <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. The Crusaders eventually swore these oaths, individually rather than as a group. In return, Alexios gave them guides and a military escort. The Crusaders were however exasperated by Byzantine tactics, such as negotiating the surrender of <a href="%C4%B0znik">Nicaea</a> from the Seljuks while it was still under <a href="Siege%20of%20Nicaea">siege</a> by the Crusaders, who hoped to plunder it to help finance their journey. The Crusaders, feeling betrayed by Alexios, who was able to recover a number of important cities and islands, and in fact much of western Asia Minor, continued on their way without Byzantine aid. In 1098, when <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a> had been captured after a long siege and the Crusaders were in turn themselves besieged in the city, Alexios marched out to meet them, but, hearing from <a href="Stephen%20II%2C%20Count%20of%20Blois">Stephen of Blois</a> that the situation was hopeless, he returned to Constantinople. The Crusaders, who had unexpectedly withstood the siege, believed Alexios had abandoned them and considered the Byzantines completely untrustworthy. Therefore, they regarded their oaths as invalidated.

By 1100, there were several <a href="Crusader%20states">Crusader states</a>, including the Principality of Antioch, founded by Bohemond in 1098. It was argued that Antioch should be returned to the Byzantines, despite Alexios's supposed betrayals, but Bohemond claimed it for himself. Alexios, of course, disagreed; Antioch had an important port, was a trade hub with Asia and a stronghold of the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox Church</a>, with an important <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Patriarch%20of%20Antioch">Eastern Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch</a>. It had only been captured from the empire a few decades previously, unlike <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, which was much farther away and had not been in Byzantine hands for centuries. Alexios therefore did not recognize the legitimacy of the Principality, believing it should be returned to the Empire according to the oaths Bohemond had sworn in 1097. He therefore set about trying to evict Bohemond from Antioch.

Bohemond added a further insult to both Alexios and the Eastern Orthodox Church in 1100 when he appointed Bernard of Valence as the <a href="Latin%20Patriarch%20of%20Antioch">Latin Patriarch</a>, and the same time expelled the Greek Patriarch, <a href="John%20the%20Oxite">John the Oxite</a>, who fled to Constantinople. Soon after, Bohemond was captured by the <a href="Danishmends">Danishmends</a> of Syria and was imprisoned for three years, during which the Antiochenes chose his nephew <a href="Tancred%2C%20Prince%20of%20Galilee">Tancred</a> as <a href="regent">regent</a>. After Bohemond was released, he was defeated by the Seljuks at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Harran">Battle of Harran</a> in 1104; this defeat led to renewed pressure on Antioch from both the Seljuks and the Byzantines. Bohemond left Tancred in control of Antioch and returned in the West, touring Italy and France for reinforcements. He won the backing of <a href="Pope%20Paschal%20II">Pope Paschal II</a> and the support of the French King <a href="Philip%20I%20of%20France">Philip I</a>, whose daughter he married. It is unclear whether his expedition qualified as a crusade.

Bohemond's <a href="Normans">Norman</a> relatives in <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> had been in conflict with the Byzantine Empire for over 30 years; his father <a href="Robert%20Guiscard">Robert Guiscard</a> was one of the Empire's most formidable enemies. While Bohemond was away, Alexios sent an army to reoccupy Antioch and the cities of <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>. In 1107, having organized a new army for his planned crusade against the Muslims in Syria, Bohemond instead launched into open warfare against Alexios, crossing the <a href="Adriatic">Adriatic</a> to <a href="Siege%20of%20Dyrrhachium%20%281107%E2%80%931108%29">lay siege</a> to <a href="Durr%C3%ABs">Dyrrhachium</a>, the westernmost city of the Empire. Like his father however, Bohemond was unable to make any significant advances into the Empire's interior; Alexios avoided a pitched battle and Bohemond's siege failed, partly due to a plague among his army. Bohemond soon found himself in an impossible position, isolated in front of Dyrrhachium: his escape by sea was cut off by the <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Venetians</a>, and Paschal II withdrew his support.

In September 1108, Alexios requested that Bohemond negotiate with him at the imperial camp at Diabolis (Devol). Bohemond had no choice but to accept, now that his disease-stricken army would no longer be able to defeat Alexios in battle. He admitted that he had violated the oath sworn in 1097, but refused to acknowledge that it had any bearing on the present circumstances, as Alexios, in Bohemond's eyes, had also violated the agreement by turning back from the siege of Antioch in 1098. Alexios agreed to consider the oaths of 1097 invalid. The specific terms of the treaty were negotiated by the general <a href="Nikephoros%20Bryennios%20the%20Younger">Nikephoros Bryennios</a>, and were recorded by <a href="Anna%20Komnene">Anna Komnene</a>:


The terms were negotiated according to Bohemond's western understanding, so that he saw himself as a <a href="feudalism">feudal</a> vassal of Alexios, a "liege man" ("homo ligius" or ) with all the obligations this implied, as customary in the West: he was obliged to bring military assistance to the Emperor, except in wars in which he was involved, and to serve him against all his enemies, in Europe and in Asia.

Anna Komnene described the proceedings with very repetitive details, with Bohemond frequently pointing out his own mistakes and praising the benevolence of Alexios and the Empire; the proceedings must have been rather humiliating for Bohemond. On the other hand, Anna's work was meant to praise her father and the terms of the treaty may not be entirely accurate.

The oral agreement was written down in two copies, one given to Alexios, and the other given to Bohemond. According to Anna, the witnesses from Bohemond's camp who signed his copy of the treaty were Maurus, <a href="bishop%20of%20Amalfi">bishop of Amalfi</a> and <a href="papal%20legate">papal legate</a>, Renard, bishop of Tarentum, and the minor clergy accompanying them; the abbot of the monastery of St. Andrew in <a href="Brindisi">Brindisi</a>, along with two of his monks; and a number of unnamed "pilgrims" (probably soldiers in Bohemond's army). From Alexios' imperial court, the treaty was witnessed by the "sebastos" Marinos of <a href="Naples">Naples</a>, <a href="Roger%20%28son%20of%20Dagobert%29">Roger son of Dagobert</a>, <a href="Peter%20Aliphas">Peter Aliphas</a>, William of Gand, <a href="Richard%20of%20the%20Principate">Richard of the Principate</a>, Geoffrey of Mailli, Hubert son of <a href="Raoul%20%28Byzantine%20family%29">Raoul</a>, Paul the Roman, envoys from the Queen's relation (from the family of the former cral/king of Bulgaria), the ambassadors Peres and Simon from Hungary, and the ambassadors Basil the Eunuch and Constantine. Many of Alexios' witnesses were themselves Westerners, who held high positions in the <a href="Byzantine%20army">Byzantine army</a> and at the imperial court; Basil and Constantine were ambassadors in the service of Bohemond's relatives in <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>.

Neither copy survives. It may have been written in <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>, or both. Both languages are equally likely given the number of westerners present, many of whom would have known Latin. It is not clear how far Bohemond's concessions were known across <a href="Romance-speaking%20Europe">Latin Europe</a>
as only a few chroniclers mention the treaty at all; <a href="Fulcher%20of%20Chartres">Fulcher of Chartres</a> simply says
that Bohemond and Alexios were reconciled.

The Treaty was weighted in Alexios' favor and provided for the eventual absorption of Antioch and its territory into the Empire. Alexios, recognizing the impossibility of driving Bohemond out of Antioch, tried to absorb him into the structure of Byzantine rule, and put him work for the Empire's benefit. Bohemond was to retain Antioch until his death with the title of "doux", unless the emperor (either Alexios or, in the future, John) chose for any reason to renege on the deal. The principality would revert to direct Byzantine rule on Bohemond's death. Bohemond therefore could not set up a dynasty in Antioch, although he was guaranteed the right to pass on to his heirs the County of Edessa, and any other territories he managed to acquire in the Syrian interior.

Bohemond's lands were to include St Simeon and the coast, the towns of <a href="Baghras">Baghras</a> and <a href="Artah">Artah</a>, and the Latin possessions in the <a href="Jebel%20as-Summaq">Jebel as-Summaq</a>. <a href="Latakia">Latakia</a> and <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>, however, were to revert to direct Byzantine rule. As <a href="Thomas%20Asbridge">Thomas Asbridge</a> points out, much of what the Emperor granted to Bohemond (including Aleppo itself) was still in Muslim hands (e.g. neither Bohemond nor Alexios controlled Edessa, although at the time Tancred was regent there as well as in Antioch), which contradicts Lilie's assessment that Bohemond did well out of the Treaty. <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Grousset">René Grousset</a> calls the Treaty a ""<a href="Diktat">Diktat</a>"", but Jean Richard underscores that the rules of <a href="feudal%20law">feudal law</a> to which Bohemond had to submit "were in no way humiliating." According to John W. Birkenmeier, the Treaty marked the point at which Alexios had developed a <a href="Komnenian%20army">new army</a>, and new tactical doctrines with which to use it, but it was not a Byzantine political success; "it traded Bohemond's freedom for a titular overlordship of <a href="Southern%20Italy">Southern Italy</a> that could never be effective, and for an occupation of Antioch that could never be carried out."

The terms of the Treaty have been interpreted in various ways. According to <a href="Paul%20Magdalino">Paul Magdalino</a> and <a href="Ralph-Johannes%20Lilie">Ralph-Johannes Lilie</a>, "the Treaty as reproduced by Anna Komnene shows an astonishing familiarity with western feudal custom; whether it was drafted by a Greek or by a Latin in imperial service, it had a sensitive regard for the western view of the "<a href="status%20quo">status quo</a>" in the East Mediterranean." So too did the diplomatic initiatives Alexios undertook, in order to enforce the Treaty on Tancred (such as the treaty he concluded with Pisa in 1110–1111, and the negotiations for Church union with Pascal II in 1112). In contrast, Asbridge has recently argued that the Treaty derived from Greek as well as western precedents, and that Alexios wished to regard Antioch as falling under the umbrella of "<a href="pronoia">pronoia</a>" arrangements.

Bohemond never returned to Antioch (he went to Sicily where he died in 1111), and the carefully constructed clauses of the Treaty were never implemented. Bohemond's nephew, Tancred, refused to honor the Treaty. In his mind, Antioch was his by <a href="right%20of%20conquest">right of conquest</a>. He saw no reason to hand it over to someone who had not been involved in the Crusade, and had indeed actively worked against it (as the Crusaders believed). The Crusaders seem to have felt Alexios had tricked Bohemond into giving him Antioch; they already believed Alexios was devious and untrustworthy and this may have confirmed their beliefs. The treaty referred to Tancred as the illegal holder of Antioch, and Alexios had expected Bohemond to expel him or somehow control him. Tancred also did not allow a Greek Patriarch to enter the city; instead, Greek Patriarchs were appointed in Constantinople and nominally held power there.
The question of the status of Antioch and the adjacent Cilician cities troubled the Empire for many years afterwards. Although the Treaty of Devol never came into effect, it provided the legal basis for Byzantine negotiations with the crusaders for the next thirty years, and for imperial claims to Antioch during the reigns of <a href="John%20II%20Komnenos">John II</a> and <a href="Manuel%20I%20Komnenos">Manuel I</a>. Therefore, John II attempted to impose his authority, traveling to Antioch himself in 1137 with his army and besieging the city. The citizens of Antioch tried to negotiate, but John demanded the unconditional surrender of the city. After asking the permission of the King of Jerusalem, <a href="King%20Fulk">Fulk</a>, which he received, <a href="Raymond%20of%20Antioch">Raymond</a>, the Prince of Antioch, agreed to surrender the city to John. The agreement, by which Raymond swore homage to John, was explicitly based on the Treaty of Devol, but went beyond it: Raymond, who was recognized as an imperial vassal for Antioch, promised the Emperor free entry to Antioch, and undertook to hand over the city in return for investiture with Aleppo, <a href="Shaizar">Shaizar</a>, <a href="Homs">Homs</a> and <a href="Hama">Hama</a> as soon as these were conquered from the Muslims. Then, Raymond would rule the new conquests and Antioch would revert to direct imperial rule. The campaign finally failed, however, partly because Raymond and <a href="Joscelin%20II%2C%20Count%20of%20Edessa">Joscelin II, Count of Edessa</a>, who had been obliged to join John as his vassals, did not pull their weight. When, on their return to Antioch, John insisted on taking possession of the city, the two princes organized a riot. John found himself besieged in the city, and was forced to leave in 1138, recalled to Constantinople. He diplomatically accepted Raymond's and Joscelin's insistence that they had nothing to do with the rebellion. John repeated his operation in 1142, but he unexpectedly died, and the Byzantine army retired.
It was not until 1158, during the reign of Manuel I, that Antioch truly became a vassal of the empire, after Manuel forced Prince <a href="Raynald%20of%20Ch%C3%A2tillon">Raynald of Châtillon</a> to swear <a href="fealty">fealty</a> to him in punishment for Raynald's attack on Byzantine <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>. The Greek Patriarch was restored, and ruled simultaneously with the Latin Patriarch. Antioch, weakened by powerless regents after Raynald's capture by the Muslims in 1160, remained a Byzantine vassal state until 1182 when internal divisions following Manuel's death in 1180 hindered the Empire's ability to enforce its claim.

In the Balkan frontier, the Treaty of Devol marked the end of the Norman threat to the southern <a href="Adriatic">Adriatic</a> littoral during Alexios' reign and later; the efficacy of the frontier defenses deterred any further invasions through Dyrrachium for most of the 12th century.

Battle of Dyrrhachium (1081)

The Battle of Dyrrhachium (near present-day <a href="Durr%C3%ABs">Durrës</a> in <a href="Albania">Albania</a>) took place on October 18, 1081 between the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>, led by the <a href="List%20of%20Byzantine%20Emperors">Emperor</a> <a href="Alexios%20I%20Komnenos">Alexios I Komnenos</a> (r. 1081–1118), and the <a href="Normans">Normans</a> of southern <a href="Italy">Italy</a> under <a href="Robert%20Guiscard">Robert Guiscard</a>, <a href="List%20of%20Counts%20and%20Dukes%20of%20Apulia%20and%20Calabria">Duke of Apulia and Calabria</a>. The battle was fought outside the city of <a href="Durr%C3%ABs">Dyrrhachium</a> (also known as "Durazzo"), the Byzantine capital of <a href="Illyria">Illyria</a>, and ended in a Norman victory.

Following the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20southern%20Italy">Norman conquest of Byzantine Italy and Saracen Sicily</a>, the Byzantine emperor, <a href="Michael%20VII%20Doukas">Michael VII Doukas</a> (r. 1071–1078), betrothed his son to <a href="Robert%20Guiscard">Robert Guiscard</a>'s daughter. When Michael was deposed, Robert took this as an excuse to invade the Byzantine Empire in 1081. His army laid siege to Dyrrhachium, but his fleet was defeated by the <a href="Venice">Venetians</a>. On October 18, the Normans engaged a Byzantine army under Alexios I Komnenos outside Dyrrhachium. The battle began with the Byzantine right wing routing the Norman left wing, which broke and fled. <a href="Varangians">Varangian</a> mercenaries joined in the pursuit of the fleeing Normans, but became separated from the main force and were massacred. Norman <a href="knight">knight</a>s in the centre attacked the Byzantine centre and routed it, causing the bulk of the Byzantine army to rout.

After this victory, the Normans took Dyrrhachium in February 1082 and advanced inland, capturing most of <a href="Macedonia%20%28region%29">Macedonia</a> and <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a>. Robert was then forced to leave <a href="Greece">Greece</a> to deal with an attack on his ally, the <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20VII">Pope</a>, by the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Emperor</a>, <a href="Henry%20IV%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Henry IV</a> (r. 1084–1105). Robert left his son <a href="Bohemond%20of%20Taranto">Bohemond</a> in charge of the army in Greece. Bohemond was initially successful, defeating Alexios in several battles, but was defeated by Alexios outside <a href="Larissa">Larissa</a>. Forced to retreat to Italy, Bohemond lost all the territory gained by the Normans in the campaign. The Byzantine recovery began the <a href="Komnenian%20restoration">Komnenian restoration</a>.

The <a href="Normans">Normans</a> first arrived in Southern Italy in 1015 from northern <a href="France">France</a> and served local <a href="Lombards">Lombard</a> <a href="lord">lord</a>s as <a href="mercenaries">mercenaries</a> against the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>. As they were paid with lands, soon they were powerful enough to challenge Papal authority; in 1054, they defeated the <a href="Pope">Pope</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Civitate">Battle of Civitate</a>, forcing him to acknowledge their authority. In 1059, the Pope made <a href="Robert%20Guiscard">Robert Guiscard</a>, of the <a href="Hauteville%20family">Hauteville family</a>, <a href="Duke">Duke</a> of <a href="Apulia">Apulia</a>, <a href="Calabria">Calabria</a>, and <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>. However, most of Apulia and Calabria were in Byzantine hands, and Sicily was in <a href="Saracen">Saracen</a> hands.

By 1071, Robert, together with his brother <a href="Roger%20I%20of%20Sicily">Roger</a>, had taken over the last Byzantine stronghold in Italy, <a href="Bari">Bari</a>. By the next year, they conquered all of Sicily, ending the Islamic <a href="Emirate%20of%20Sicily">Emirate of Sicily</a>. In 1073, the Byzantine Emperor <a href="Michael%20VII">Michael VII</a> sent an envoy to Robert offering the hand of his son <a href="Constantine%20Doukas%20%28co-emperor%29">Constantine</a> to Robert's daughter Helena. Guiscard accepted the offer and sent his daughter to <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>. However, in 1078, Michael was overthrown by <a href="Nicephorus%20Botaneiates">Nicephorus Botaneiates</a>, an event that destroyed any chances Helena had for the throne. This gave Robert a motive to invade the empire claiming his daughter had been mistreated; however, his intervention was delayed by a revolt in Italy.

Robert conscripted all men of a fighting age into the army, which he refitted. Meanwhile, he sent an ambassador to the Byzantine court with orders to demand proper treatment for Helena and to win over the <a href="Byzantine%20aristocracy%20and%20bureaucracy%23Army">Domestic of the Schools</a>, Alexios. The results of these attempts remain unknown, but the ambassador fell under Alexios's charm and as he was returning to Italy, he heard of Alexios's successful coup against Botaneiates, by which he became <a href="Alexios%20I%20Komnenos">Alexios I Komnenos</a>.

When the ambassador returned, he urged Robert to make peace, claiming that Alexios wanted nothing but friendship with the Normans. Robert had no intention of peace; he sent his son <a href="Bohemond%20I%20of%20Antioch">Bohemond</a> with an advance force towards Greece and Bohemond landed at <a href="Vlor%C3%AB">Aulon</a>, with Robert following shortly after.

The Norman fleet of 150 ships including 60 <a href="Horse%20transports%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages">horse transports</a> set off towards the Byzantine Empire at the end of May 1081. The army numbered 15,000 men, including about 1,300 Norman knights. The fleet sailed to <a href="Vlor%C3%AB">Avalona</a> in Byzantine territory; they were joined by several ships from <a href="Republic%20of%20Ragusa">Ragusa</a>, a republic in the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a> who were enemies of the Byzantines.

Robert soon left Avalona and sailed to the island of <a href="Corfu">Corfu</a>, which surrendered because of a small garrison. Having won a bridgehead and a clear path for reinforcements from Italy, he advanced on the city of <a href="Durr%C3%ABs">Dyrrhachium</a>, the capital and chief port of <a href="Illyria">Illyria</a>. The city was well defended on a long, narrow peninsula running parallel to the coast, but separated by marshlands. Guiscard brought his army onto the peninsula and pitched camp outside the city walls. However, as Robert's fleet sailed to Dyrrhachium, it was hit by a storm and lost several ships.

Meanwhile, when Alexios heard that the Normans were preparing to invade Byzantine territory, he sent an ambassador to the <a href="Doge%20of%20Venice">Doge</a> of <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Venice</a>, <a href="Domenico%20Selvo">Domenico Selvo</a>, requesting aid and offering trading rights in return. The Doge, alarmed by Norman control of the <a href="Strait%20of%20Otranto">Strait of Otranto</a>, took command of the Venetian fleet and sailed at once, surprising the Norman fleet under the command of Bohemond as night was falling. The Normans counter-attacked tenaciously, but their inexperience in naval combat betrayed them. The experienced Venetian navy attacked in a close <a href="Tactical%20formation">formation</a> known as "sea harbour" and together with their use of <a href="Greek%20fire">Greek fire</a> "bombs", the Norman line scattered, and the Venetian fleet sailed into Dyrrhachium's harbour.

Robert was not discouraged by this naval defeat, and began his siege of Dyrrhachium. In command of the garrison at Dyrrhachium was the experienced general <a href="George%20Palaiologos">George Palaiologos</a>, sent by Alexios with orders to hold out at all costs while Alexios himself mustered an army to relieve the city.

Meanwhile, a Byzantine fleet arrived and – after joining with the Venetian fleet – attacked the Norman fleet, which was again routed. The garrison at Dyrrhachium managed to hold out all summer, despite Robert's <a href="catapults">catapults</a>, <a href="ballistae">ballistae</a> and <a href="siege%20tower">siege tower</a>. The garrison made continuous sallies from the city; on one occasion, Palaiologos fought all day with an arrowhead in his skull. Another sally succeeded in destroying Robert's siege tower.

Robert's camp was struck by disease; according to contemporary historian <a href="Anna%20Comnena">Anna Comnena</a> up to 10,000 men died, including 500 knights. Even so, the situation of the Dyrrhachium garrison grew desperate because of the effects of Norman siege weapons. Alexios learned of this while he was in <a href="Salonica">Salonica</a> with his army so he advanced in full force against the Normans. According to Comnena, Alexios had about 20,000 men; historian John Haldon puts the army's size between 18,000 and 20,000 men, while John Birkenmeier estimates it between 20–25,000 men. It consisted of <a href="Thrace">Thracian</a> and <a href="Macedonia%20%28theme%29">Macedonian</a> <a href="tagma%20%28military%29">tagma</a>ta, which numbered about 5,000 men; the elite <a href="excubitors">excubitors</a> and <a href="vestiaritai">vestiaritai</a> units, which numbered around 1,000 men; a force of <a href="Manichaeism">Manichaeans</a> which comprised 2,800 men, <a href="Thessaly">Thessalian</a> <a href="cavalry">cavalry</a>, Balkan <a href="conscription">conscripts</a>, <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a>n <a href="infantry">infantry</a> and other light troops. As well as the native troops, the Byzantines were joined by 2,000 <a href="Seljuk%20Turks">Turkish</a> and 1,000 Frankish <a href="mercenary">mercenaries</a>, about 1,000 <a href="Varangian">Varangian</a>s and 7,000 Turkish <a href="auxiliaries">auxiliaries</a> sent by the <a href="Seljuk%20Sultanate%20of%20R%C3%BBm">Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm</a>. Alexios also withdrew the tagmas from <a href="Heraclea%20Pontica">Heraclea Pontica</a> and the remaining Byzantine holdings in <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a> and by doing so, he effectively left them to be overrun by the Turks.

Alexios advanced from Salonica and pitched camp on the river Charzanes near Dyrrhachium on October 15. He held a war council there and sought advice from his senior officers; among them was George Palaiologos, who had managed to sneak out of the city. A majority of the senior officers, including Palaiologos, urged caution, noting that time was with the Emperor. Alexios, however, favoured an immediate assault, hoping to catch Guiscard's army from the rear, while they were still besieging the city. Alexios moved his army to the hills opposite the city, planning to attack the Normans the next day.

Guiscard, however, had been informed of Alexios' arrival by his scouts and on the night of October 17, he moved his army from the peninsula to the mainland. Upon learning of Guiscard's move, Alexios revised his battle plan. He split his army into three divisions, with the left wing under the command of <a href="Gregory%20Pakourianos">Gregory Pakourianos</a>, the right wing under the command of <a href="Nikephoros%20Melissenos">Nikephoros Melissenos</a>, and himself in command of the centre. Guiscard formed his battle line opposite Alexios's, with the right wing under the command of the Count of Giovinazzo, the left under Bohemond and Guiscard facing Alexios in the centre.

The Varangians had been ordered to march just in front of the main line with a strong division of archers a little behind them. The archers had been commanded to move in front of the Varangians and fire a volley before retreating behind them. The archers continued this tactic until the army neared contact.

As the opposing armies closed in, Guiscard sent a detachment of cavalry positioned in the centre to feint an attack on the Byzantine positions. Guiscard hoped the feint would draw up the Varangians; however, this plan failed when the cavalry was forced back by the archers. The Norman right wing suddenly charged forward to the point where the Byzantine left and centre met, directing its attack against the Varangian left flank. The Varangians stood their ground while the Byzantine left, including some of Alexios' elite troops, attacked the Normans. The Norman formation disintegrated and the routed Normans fled towards the beach. There, according to Comnena, they were rallied by Guiscard's wife, <a href="Sikelgaita">Sikelgaita</a>, described as "like another <a href="Pallas%20%28daughter%20of%20Triton%29">Pallas</a>, if not a second <a href="Athena">Athena</a>".

In the meantime, the Byzantine right and centre had been engaging in <a href="skirmish">skirmish</a>es with the Normans opposite them. However, with the collapse of the Norman right, the knights were in danger of being outflanked. At this point, the Varangians (mainly <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxons</a> who had left <a href="England">England</a> after the <a href="Norman%20Conquest">Norman Conquest</a>) joined in the pursuit of the Norman right. With their massive <a href="battle%20axe">battle axe</a>s, the Varangians attacked the Norman knights, who were driven away after their horses panicked. The Varangians soon became separated from the main force and exhausted so they were in no position to resist an assault. Guiscard sent a strong force of <a href="spear">spear</a>men and <a href="crossbowmen">crossbowmen</a> against the Varangian flank and inflicted heavy casualties on them. The few remaining Varangians fled into the church of the <a href="Archangel%20Michael">Archangel Michael</a>. The Normans immediately set the church on fire, and all Varangians perished in the blaze.

Meanwhile, <a href="Palaeologus%23Dynasty">George Palaiologos</a> <a href="sortie%20%28siege%20warfare%29">sortie</a>d out of Dyrrhachium, but failed to save the situation. Alexios's ally, Serbian King <a href="Constantine%20Bodin">Constantine Bodin</a> stayed aside with his army, intending to await the outcome of the battle. When the Byzantines were defeated and started to flee, Bodin retreated with his army. The Turks who had been lent to him by the Seljuk Sultan <a href="Suleyman%20I%20of%20R%C3%BBm">Suleyman I</a> followed Constantine's example.

Deprived of his left wing (still in pursuit of the Norman right), Alexios was exposed in the centre. Guiscard sent his heavy cavalry against the Byzantine centre. They first routed the Byzantine skirmishers before breaking into small detachments and smashing into various points of the Byzantine line. This charge broke the Byzantine lines and caused them to rout. The imperial camp, which had been left unguarded, fell to the Normans.

Alexios and his guards resisted as long as they could before retreating. As they retreated, Alexios was separated from his guard and was attacked by Norman soldiers. While escaping, he was wounded in his forehead and lost a lot of blood, but eventually made it back to <a href="Ohrid">Ohrid</a>, where he regrouped his army.

The battle was a heavy defeat for Alexios. Historian Jonathan Harris states that the defeat was "every bit as severe as that at <a href="Battle%20of%20Manzikert">Manzikert</a>." He lost about 5,000 of his men, including most of the Varangians. Norman losses are unknown, but John Haldon claims they are substantial as both wings broke and fled. Historian Robert Holmes states: "The new knightly tactic of charging with the lance "couched" – tucked firmly under the arm to unite the impact of man and horse – proved a battle-winner."

George Palaiologos had not been able to re-enter the city after the battle and left with the main force. The defense of the <a href="citadel">citadel</a> was left to the Venetians, while the city itself was left to the <a href="Count%20of%20the%20Tent">Count of the Tent</a> (or Byzantine provincial administrators) mobilizing from <a href="Arbanon">Arbanon</a> (i.e., ἐξ Ἀρβάνων ὁρμωμένω Κομισκόρτη; the term "Κομισκόρτη" is short for κόμης της κόρτης meaning "Count of the Tent").

In February 1082, Dyrrhachium fell after a Venetian or <a href="Amalfi">Amalfi</a>an citizen opened the gates to the Normans. The Norman army proceeded to take most of northern Greece without facing much resistance. While Guiscard was in <a href="Kastoria">Kastoria</a>, messengers arrived from Italy, bearing news that <a href="Apulia">Apulia</a>, <a href="Calabria">Calabria</a>, and <a href="Campania">Campania</a> were in revolt. He also learned that the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a>, <a href="Henry%20IV%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Henry IV</a>, was at the gates of <a href="Rome">Rome</a> and besieging <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20VII">Pope Gregory VII</a>, a Norman ally. Alexios had negotiated with Henry and given him 360,000 gold pieces in return for an alliance. Henry responded by invading Italy and attacking the Pope. Guiscard rushed to Italy, leaving Bohemond in command of the army in Greece.

Alexios, desperate for money, ordered the confiscation of all the church's treasure. With this money, Alexios mustered an army near Thessalonica and went to fight Bohemond. However, Bohemond defeated Alexios in two battles: one near <a href="Arta%2C%20Greece">Arta</a> and the other near <a href="Ioannina">Ioannina</a>. This left Bohemond in control of <a href="Macedonia%20%28region%29">Macedonia</a> and nearly all of <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a>. Bohemond advanced with his army against the city of <a href="Larissa">Larissa</a>. Meanwhile, Alexios had mustered a new army and with 7,000 Seljuk Turks sent by the Sultan, he advanced on the Normans at Larissa and defeated them. The demoralised and unpaid Norman army returned to the coast and sailed back to Italy. Meanwhile, Alexios granted the Venetians a commercial colony in Constantinople, as well as exemption from trading duties in return for their renewed aid. They responded by recapturing Dyrrhachium and Corfu and returning them to the Byzantine Empire. These victories returned the Empire to its previous <a href="status%20quo">status quo</a> and marked the beginning of the <a href="Komnenian%20restoration">Komnenian restoration</a>.

Walter Krueger

Walter Krueger (26 January 1881 – 20 August 1967) was an American soldier and <a href="general%20officer">general officer</a> in the first half of the 20th century. He is best known for his command of the <a href="Sixth%20United%20States%20Army">Sixth United States Army</a> in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area">South West Pacific Area</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. He rose from the rank of <a href="Private%20%28rank%29">private</a> to <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">general</a> in the United States Army.

Born in <a href="Z%C5%82ot%C3%B3w">Flatow</a>, <a href="Province%20of%20West%20Prussia">West Prussia</a>, Krueger emigrated to the United States as a boy. He enlisted for service in the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a> and served in Cuba, and then re-enlisted for service in the <a href="Philippine%E2%80%93American%20War">Philippine–American War</a>. He was commissioned as a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in 1901. In 1914 he was posted to the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Army%20National%20Guard">Pennsylvania Army National Guard</a>. His regiment was mobilized on 23 June 1916 and served along the Mexican border. After the United States commenced hostilities with Germany in April 1917, Krueger was assigned to the <a href="84th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">84th Infantry Division</a> as its Assistant Chief of Staff G-3 (Operations), and then its chief of staff. In February 1918, he was sent to <a href="Langres">Langres</a> to attend the <a href="American%20Expeditionary%20Force">American Expeditionary Force</a> General Staff School, and in October 1918, he became chief of staff of the <a href="Tank%20Corps%20of%20the%20American%20Expeditionary%20Force">Tank Corps</a>.

Between the wars, Krueger served in a number of command and staff positions, and attended the <a href="Naval%20War%20College">Naval War College</a> at his own request. In 1941, he assumed command of the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Central">Third Army</a>, which he led in the <a href="Louisiana%20Maneuvers">Louisiana Maneuvers</a>. He expected, in view of his age, to spend the war at home training troops, but in 1943 he was sent to General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>'s Southwest Pacific Area as commander of the Sixth Army and Alamo Force, which he led in a series of victorious campaigns against the Japanese. As an army commander, Krueger had to grapple with the problems imposed by vast distances, inhospitable terrain, unfavorable climate, and an indefatigable and dangerous enemy. He had to balance MacArthur's need to speed up the tempo of operations in order to win campaigns with the more cautious approach of subordinates who often found themselves confronted by unexpectedly large numbers of Japanese troops. In the <a href="Battle%20of%20Luzon">Battle of Luzon</a> in 1945, his largest, longest and last battle, he was finally able to maneuver his army as he had in 1941 against a Japanese army under <a href="Tomoyuki%20Yamashita">Tomoyuki Yamashita</a>.

Krueger retired to <a href="San%20Antonio%2C%20Texas">San Antonio, Texas</a>, where he bought a house and wrote "From Down Under to Nippon", an account of his campaigns in the Southwest Pacific. His retirement was marred by family tragedies. His son James was dismissed from the army in 1947 for <a href="conduct%20unbecoming%20an%20officer%20and%20a%20gentleman">conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman</a>. His wife's health deteriorated, and she died of cancer in 1956. His daughter Dorothy stabbed her husband to death in 1952. She was sentenced to life imprisonment by a court-martial, but <a href="Kinsella%20v.%20Krueger">was freed</a> by the <a href="US%20Supreme%20Court">Supreme Court</a> in 1957.

Walter Krueger was born in <a href="Z%C5%82ot%C3%B3w">Flatow</a>, <a href="Province%20of%20West%20Prussia">West Prussia</a>, then part of the <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a>, but now part of <a href="Poland">Poland</a>. He was the son of Julius Krüger, a <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>n landowner who had served as an officer in the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a>, and his wife, Anna, formerly Hasse. Following Julius's death, Anna and her three children emigrated to the United States to be near her uncle in <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a>. Walter was then eight years old. In St. Louis, Anna married Emil Carl Schmidt, a <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a> minister. The family subsequently settled in <a href="Madison%2C%20Indiana">Madison, Indiana</a>. Krueger was educated at the Upper Seminary School in Madison, and the Cincinnati Technical High School in <a href="Cincinnati%2C%20Ohio">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>. As a teenager, he wanted to become a naval officer, but when his mother objected he decided to become a <a href="blacksmith">blacksmith</a> instead.

On 17 June 1898, Krueger, along with many of his fellow high-school students, enlisted for service in the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a> with the 2nd United States Volunteer Infantry. He reached <a href="Santiago%20de%20Cuba">Santiago de Cuba</a> a few weeks after the <a href="Battle%20of%20San%20Juan%20Hill">Battle of San Juan Hill</a>, and spent eight months there on occupation duties, rising to the rank of <a href="sergeant">sergeant</a>. Mustered out of the volunteers in February 1899, he returned home to Ohio, planning to become a civil engineer.

However, many of his comrades were re-enlisting for service in the <a href="Philippine%E2%80%93American%20War">Philippine–American War</a> and in June 1899 Krueger re-enlisted as a private in M Company of the <a href="12th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">12th Infantry</a>. Soon he was on his way to fight <a href="Emilio%20Aguinaldo">Emilio Aguinaldo</a>'s "Insurrectos" as part of <a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="Arthur%20MacArthur%2C%20Jr.">Arthur MacArthur, Jr.</a>'s 2nd Division of the <a href="Eighth%20Army%20Corps%20%28Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War%29">Eighth Army Corps</a>. He took part in the advance from <a href="Angeles%20City">Angeles City</a> to <a href="Tarlac%20City">Tarlac City</a>, Aguinaldo's capital. But Aguinaldo had fled, and the 12th Infantry pursued him vainly all the way through Luzon's central plain to <a href="Dagupan%20City">Dagupan City</a>. While serving in an infantry unit in the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>, he was promoted to sergeant. On 1 July 1901, he was commissioned a <a href="second%20lieutenant%23United%20States">second lieutenant</a> and posted to the <a href="30th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">30th Infantry</a> on <a href="Marinduque">Marinduque</a>.

Krueger returned to the United States with the 30th Infantry in December 1903. The regiment moved to <a href="Offutt%20Air%20Force%20Base%23Fort%20Crook">Fort Crook, Nebraska</a>. In September 1904, he married Grace Aileen Norvell, whom he had met in the Philippines. They had three children: James Norvell, born on 29 July 1905; Walter Jr., born on 25 April 1910; and Dorothy Jane, who was born on 24 January 1913. Both James and Walter Jr. attended the <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">United States Military Academy</a>, James graduating with the class of 1926, and Walter Jr. with the class of 1931. Dorothy married an army officer, Aubrey D. Smith, of the class of 1930.

In 1904, Krueger attended and graduated from the Infantry-Cavalry School at <a href="Fort%20Leavenworth%2C%20Kansas">Fort Leavenworth, Kansas</a>. This was followed by the <a href="Command%20and%20General%20Staff%20College">Command and General Staff College</a> in 1907. He then joined the <a href="23rd%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">23rd Infantry</a> at <a href="Fort%20Ontario">Fort Ontario</a>, New York. After a second tour in the Philippines, he returned to the United States in June 1909, and was assigned to Department of Languages at Fort Leavenworth as an instructor in Spanish, French and German, which he could speak fluently. He also taught <a href="National%20Guard%20of%20the%20United%20States">National Guard</a> officers at <a href="Fort%20Benjamin%20Harrison">Camp Benjamin Harrison</a>, Indiana, and <a href="Pine%20Camp">Pine Camp</a>, New York. He published translations of several German military texts, most notably <a href="William%20Balck">William Balck</a>'s "Tactics". The book attracted the attention of the <a href="Chief%20of%20Staff%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Army">Chief of Staff of the United States Army</a>, Major General <a href="Leonard%20Wood">Leonard Wood</a>, and was widely read.

With the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> in August 1914, Krueger was offered a post as an observer with the <a href="German%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">German Army</a> but was forced to turn it down due to familial commitments. Instead, he was posted to the <a href="110th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">10th Infantry</a> of the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Army%20National%20Guard">Pennsylvania Army National Guard</a>. The regiment was mobilized on 23 June 1916 and served along the Mexican border for five months as part of the <a href="Pancho%20Villa%20Expedition">Mexican Punitive Expedition</a> under Major General <a href="John%20J.%20Pershing">John J. Pershing</a>, although no National Guard units fought Mexican troops. The unit was mustered out in October 1916. Afterwards, Krueger remained with the National Guard. He trained units, and helped establish a school for officers at the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>. In an article in the "Infantry Journal", he called for a large, national, conscript army similar to those of European countries, arguing that this would be in accord with America's democratic values.

After the United States commenced hostilities against Germany in April 1917, Krueger was assigned to the <a href="84th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">84th Infantry Division</a> at <a href="Camp%20Zachary%20Taylor">Camp Zachary Taylor</a> as its Assistant Chief of Staff G-3 (Operations). He became its chief of staff, with the rank of <a href="Major%20%28rank%29">major</a> as of 5 August 1917. In February 1918, he was sent to <a href="Langres">Langres</a>, France, to attend the <a href="American%20Expeditionary%20Force">American Expeditionary Force</a> General Staff School. All officers from divisions that were not under orders for France were ordered to return home in May 1918, but Krueger stayed on as G-3 of the <a href="26th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">26th Infantry Division</a>. The <a href="French%20Army">French Army</a> requested that Krueger be sent home due to his German origin, and Krueger was re-posted to the 84th Division, but he soon returned to France, as the 84th Division embarked for France in August 1918. In October, he became chief of staff of the <a href="Tank%20Corps%20of%20the%20American%20Expeditionary%20Force">Tank Corps</a>. After the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany">Armistice with Germany</a> ended the fighting in November 1918, he became assistant chief of staff of <a href="U.S.%20VI%20Corps">VI</a> and <a href="U.S.%20IV%20Corps">IV Corps</a> on <a href="Occupation%20of%20the%20Rhineland">occupation duty</a>, advancing to the rank of temporary <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">colonel</a>. For his service in the war, he was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Medal%20%28U.S.%20Army%29">Distinguished Service Medal</a> in 1919.

With the end of the war, Krueger returned to the United States on 22 June 1919 and was initially posted to the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Infantry%20School">Infantry School</a> at <a href="Fort%20Benning%2C%20Georgia">Fort Benning, Georgia</a>. In 1920, he assumed command of the <a href="55th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">55th Infantry Regiment</a> at <a href="Camp%20Funston%2C%20Kansas">Camp Funston, Kansas</a>. He reverted to his permanent rank of captain on 30 June 1920 but was promoted to the permanent rank of major the next day. He attended the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20War%20College">Army War College</a>, graduating in 1921, and remaining for a year as an instructor, where he taught such classes as the "Art of Command". He paid a four-month visit to Germany in 1922 as part of the War College's Historical Section, during which he examined documents related to World War I in the German War Archives. These informed his lectures on the war, and he argued that much of the German Army's effectiveness was attributable to its system of <a href="Mission%20Command">decentralized command</a>. Krueger urged that American commanders in the field should be given wider latitude in carrying out their orders.
From 1922 to 1925, Krueger served in the War Plans Division of the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20War">War Department</a> <a href="General%20Staff">General Staff</a> in <a href="Washington%2C%20DC">Washington, DC</a>. Krueger worked on the <a href="United%20States%20color-coded%20war%20plans">United States color-coded war plans</a>, particularly War Plan Green, for another war with Mexico, and War Plan Blue, for another civil war in the United States. He traveled to the <a href="Panama%20Canal%20Zone">Panama Canal Zone</a> in January 1923 to report on the state of the defenses there. After he returned, he was assigned to the Joint Army and Navy Planning Committee, an organ of the <a href="Joint%20Army%20and%20Navy%20Board">Joint Army and Navy Board</a> responsible for coordinating war plans between the two services. While with the Joint Planning Committee, he worked on War Plan Orange, the plan for a war with Japan, and War Plan Tan, for a war with Cuba. Krueger considered the problems of inter-service cooperation. At his own request, he attended the <a href="Naval%20War%20College">Naval War College</a> at <a href="Newport%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Newport, Rhode Island</a>, in 1925 and 1926. He continued to ruminate on the nature of command. "Doctrine", he wrote, "knits all the parts of the military force together in intellectual bonds."

Krueger came to feel that the prospects for promotion in the infantry were very poor, and in 1927 he tried to transfer to the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Corps">United States Army Air Corps</a>. He attended the Air Corps Primary Flying School at <a href="Brooks%20Field%2C%20Texas">Brooks Field, Texas</a>, but suffered an attack of <a href="neuritis">neuritis</a> in his right arm, and his flight instructor, Lieutenant <a href="Claire%20Lee%20Chennault">Claire Lee Chennault</a>, failed him. In December 1927, he was offered a position as an instructor at the Naval War College, where he taught classes on World War I, and on joint operations.

In June 1932, Krueger became commander of the <a href="6th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">6th Infantry Regiment</a> at <a href="Jefferson%20Barracks">Jefferson Barracks</a>, Missouri, where he was promoted to colonel again on 1 August 1932. Now aged 51, he became resigned to retiring as a colonel, but in 1934 he returned to the War Plans Division, becoming chief of the division in May 1936, and was promoted to temporary <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">brigadier general</a> in October 1936. In September 1938, Krueger went to <a href="Fort%20George%20G.%20Meade">Fort George G. Meade</a>, Maryland, as commander of the 16th Infantry Brigade. He was promoted to temporary major general in February 1939, when he became commander of the <a href="2nd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">2nd Infantry Division</a> at <a href="Fort%20Sam%20Houston">Fort Sam Houston</a>, Texas. The 2nd Infantry Division was at the time being used as a test of the US Army's new <a href="triangular%20division">triangular division</a> concept. As a result, Krueger made a series of suggestions as to how the organization could be improved. He became interested in the possibilities of mechanization and fast-paced modern warfare, which were tested in maneuvers with his division. His troops called themselves the "Blitzkruegers".

Krueger became commander of <a href="IX%20Corps%20%28United%20States%29">IX Corps</a> on 31 January 1940. This corps was created to control units of the <a href="Third%20Army%20%28United%20States%29">Third Army</a> engaged in large scale maneuvers in 1940, in which Krueger's IX Corps conducted a series of mock battles against <a href="Walter%20Short">Walter Short</a>'s <a href="IV%20Corps%20%28United%20States%29">IV Corps</a>. On 27 June, Krueger became commander of the <a href="VIII%20Corps%20%28United%20States%29">VIII Corps</a>. On 16 May 1941, he was promoted to <a href="Lieutenant%20general%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant general</a>, in command of the Third Army. He also became commander of the <a href="Southern%20Defense%20Command">Southern Defense Command</a> on 16 July 1941. Krueger asked for—and got—Colonel <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> assigned to him as his chief of staff.

The <a href="Louisiana%20Maneuvers">Louisiana Maneuvers</a> pitted Krueger's Third Army against Lieutenant General <a href="Ben%20Lear">Ben Lear</a>'s <a href="Second%20Army%20%28United%20States%29">Second Army</a>. The maneuvers were a test ground for doctrine and equipment, and gave senior commanders experience in maneuvering their formations. In the first phase, Krueger quickly proved himself to be the more modern general. He responded adroitly to a changed battle situation by re-orienting his front from northeast to northwest, and was able to inflict a series of reverses on Lear's forces. In the second phase, Krueger had a superior force, and had to advance on <a href="Shreveport%2C%20Louisiana">Shreveport, Louisiana</a>. Lear's forces conducted a stubborn withdrawal, demolishing bridges in order to slow Krueger down. Krueger responded by sending Major General <a href="George%20S.%20Patton%2C%20Jr.">George S. Patton, Jr.</a>'s <a href="2nd%20Armored%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">2nd Armored Division</a> on a wide flanking maneuver through Texas. Afterwards, Eisenhower became the head of the War Plans Division, and was replaced by Colonel <a href="Alfred%20M.%20Gruenther">Alfred M. Gruenther</a>. After he too was transferred, Krueger replaced him with Colonel <a href="George%20B.%20Honnen">George B. Honnen</a>.

Krueger wrote to a friend that 

It therefore came as a surprise when Krueger was informed that a theater commander had requested his services. <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>, the Supreme Commander of the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area%20%28command%29">Southwest Pacific Area</a> (SWPA), said that he was "especially anxious to have Krueger due to my long and intimate association with him". This too came as a surprise to Krueger; while the two men had known each other for forty years, and Krueger had been chief of the War Plans Division when MacArthur was chief of staff, the two had never been close.
The War Department approved Krueger's transfer to SWPA, but did not approve MacArthur's request for Third Army headquarters. There were only three American divisions in SWPA: the <a href="32nd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">32nd Infantry Division</a> at <a href="Rockhampton%2C%20Queensland">Rockhampton, Queensland</a>, the <a href="41st%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">41st Infantry Division</a> in the <a href="Buna%2C%20Papua%20New%20Guinea">Buna</a> area in <a href="Territory%20of%20Papua">Papua</a>, and the <a href="1st%20Marine%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">1st Marine Division</a> in <a href="Melbourne%2C%20Victoria">Melbourne, Victoria</a>. The <a href="1st%20Cavalry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">1st Cavalry Division</a> and the <a href="24th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">24th Infantry Division</a> were scheduled to arrive in 1943, and other divisions would follow in 1944, but for the time being there were much fewer troops than an army would normally control. The War Department therefore saw no need for a full strength army headquarters. Instead, Krueger had to make do with him a skeleton staff of a new <a href="Sixth%20United%20States%20Army">Sixth Army</a>, which was activated in January 1943, with less than half the establishment strength of an army headquarters.

Krueger took with him several key members of the Third Army staff, including Brigadier General George Honnen as chief of staff, Colonel <a href="George%20H.%20Decker">George H. Decker</a> as deputy chief of staff, Colonel George S. Price as assistant chief of staff, G-1 (Personnel), Colonel Horton V. White as assistant chief of staff, G-2 (intelligence), <a href="Clyde%20Eddleman">Clyde Eddleman</a> as assistant chief of staff, G-3 (operations) and Colonel Kenneth Pierce as assistant chief of staff, G-4 (supply). Honnen had health problems, and spent much of April, May and June 1943 in hospital before being ordered home on 18 June. He was replaced by Brigadier General <a href="Edwin%20D.%20Patrick">Edwin D. Patrick</a>, who had served on the staff of <a href="Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Admiral</a> <a href="William%20F.%20Halsey">William F. Halsey</a> in the <a href="South%20Pacific%20Area">South Pacific Area</a>. Patrick did not get along smoothly with Krueger or the rest of the Sixth Army staff, and in May 1944 Patrick was appointed to command the <a href="158th%20Regimental%20Combat%20Team">158th Regimental Combat Team</a>, and Decker became chief of staff.

<a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area%20%28command%29">Command in the Southwest Pacific Area</a> was complicated. Instead of operations being conducted by the Sixth Army, its headquarters was used for what became Alamo Force. As a task force, Alamo Force came directly under MacArthur, rather than under the Allied Land Forces. Krueger noted that "the inherent difficulties faced by my dual headquarters in planning and administration were aggravated by the command setup, which was a novel one to say the least." Because Alamo Force was a purely operational entity, administration was handled by the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Forces%20in%20the%20Far%20East">United States Army Forces in the Far East</a>. Although there was only one army staff, Alamo Force was in New Guinea while the main body of Sixth Army headquarters was in <a href="Brisbane%2C%20Queensland">Brisbane</a> until February 1944, when the two were finally brought together. They still had a dual role as Alamo Force and Sixth Army until September, when Alamo Force was discontinued and the Sixth Army became directly responsible for operations.

The geographical, engineering and logistical difficulties of conducting operations in SWPA were driven home by Alamo Force's first operation, <a href="Operation%20Chronicle">Operation Chronicle</a>, the occupation of <a href="Woodlark%20Island">Woodlark</a> and <a href="Kiriwina">Kiriwina</a> Islands in June 1943. Despite the fact that the operation was unopposed by the Japanese, it was subject to delays. Krueger visited Kiriwina, where road work and airbase development were held up by heavy rains, on 11 July. He was dissatisfied with the rate of progress and relieved the task force commander. The arrival of additional engineers sped up the base development effort, and <a href="No.%2079%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 79 Squadron RAAF</a> commenced operations from Kiriwina on 18 August.
He was also concerned by reports of the <a href="Operation%20Cottage">invasion of Kiska</a> in the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian Islands</a> in August 1943, in which a large Allied force invaded an island that had already been evacuated by the Japanese. If this could happen, it was also possible that a force might attack where the Japanese were unexpectedly strong. Different levels of command sometimes came up with widely varying estimates of Japanese strength because they used different methods to estimate it.

An attempt to obtain information for <a href="Operation%20Dexterity">Operation Dexterity</a>, the attack on New Britain, with a joint Army-Navy reconnaissance team raised issues of inter-service cooperation. The Navy was mainly interested in gathering <a href="Hydrography">hydrographic</a> data rather than information on the state of the Japanese defenders. Because of a breakdown in communications, the <a href="PT%20boat">PT boat</a> that was supposed to collect the team was unable to rendezvous with it, and the team had to spend eleven more days on the island. Finally, the Navy tried to prevent the Army commander from briefing Alamo Force headquarters on what had occurred.

Krueger decided that he needed to have his own strategic reconnaissance capability. In November 1943, he formed the <a href="Alamo%20Scouts">Alamo Scouts</a> as a special unit for reconnaissance and raiding. An Alamo Scout Training Center for volunteers was established on <a href="Fergusson%20Island">Fergusson Island</a>, not far from Alamo Force's headquarters on <a href="Goodenough%20Island">Goodenough Island</a>, under the command of Colonel Frederick W. Bradshaw, whom Krueger had first encountered during the Louisiana maneuvers. The top graduates of the six-week training course were assigned to the Alamo Scouts; the other graduates were returned to their units where they could be used for similar work. By the end of the war, Alamo Scouts teams had conducted 106 missions.

In what became a standard procedure in SWPA, MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) nominated the objectives, set the target date, and allocated the troops to the operation, leaving Alamo Force to work out the details. MacArthur was not inflexible, however, and allowed Krueger to alter the staging areas, and postpone the operation by a month. Krueger's concerns about the possibility of high casualties in securing the <a href="Gasmata">Gasmata</a> area, and doubts as to whether the area was suitable for airbase development, led to it being dropped as a target. <a href="Battle%20of%20Arawe">Arawe was substituted</a>, and the size of the whole operation was scaled back. Krueger hoped to observe the 1st Marine Division's <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20Gloucester">landing at Cape Gloucester</a> in December 1943, but was unable to do so until the planning for the January 1944 <a href="landing%20at%20Saidor">landing at Saidor</a> was complete. He crossed the <a href="Dampier%20Strait%20%28Papua%20New%20Guinea%29">Dampier Strait</a> in a PT boat in stormy weather. <a href="PBY%20Catalina">PBY Catalina</a>s sent to bring him back were unable to land, and he had to return on the <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> .

Krueger accepted reports of a Japanese counterattack at Saidor, and sent reinforcements in response, but the attack did not eventuate. Because the 32nd Infantry Division was required for the upcoming <a href="Hansa%20Bay">Hansa Bay</a> operation, he was initially reluctant to authorize it to block the trails behind the American beachhead. When he finally did so, it was too late. The retreating Japanese made good their escape, thereby defeating the whole purpose of the operation. The next operation, the <a href="Admiralty%20Islands%20campaign">Admiralty Islands campaign</a> in February 1944, played out differently. Based on <a href="Fifth%20Air%20Force">Fifth Air Force</a> reports that the islands were unoccupied, MacArthur accelerated his timetable and ordered an immediate <a href="reconnaissance%20in%20force">reconnaissance in force</a> of the islands. Krueger sent in the Alamo Scouts, who confirmed that the islands were still well-defended.

Krueger did what he could to accelerate the movement of units of Major General <a href="Innis%20P.%20Swift">Innis P. Swift</a>'s 1st Cavalry Division to the Admiralty Islands in response to urgent pleas from Brigadier General <a href="William%20C.%20Chase">William C. Chase</a>, who managed to defeat the numerically superior Japanese forces. Krueger was unimpressed with Chase. "His task", Krueger wrote to Swift, "was undoubtedly a difficult one, but did not, in my judgment, warrant the nervousness apparent in some of his despatches. This, and his failure to obey repeated positive orders to furnish detailed information of his situation and his losses, his closing his radio station during long periods, and his evident ignorance that reinforcements could not reach him by the times he demanded, were not calculated to inspire confidence."

Over the next few months, the tempo of operations increased, forcing the Sixth Army to plan and execute multiple operations simultaneously. <a href="Operations%20Reckless%20and%20Persecution">Operations Reckless and Persecution</a> in April 1944 together comprised the largest operation yet in SWPA, with the 24th and 41st Infantry Divisions of Lieutenant General <a href="Robert%20L.%20Eichelberger">Robert L. Eichelberger</a>'s <a href="I%20Corps%20%28United%20States%29">I Corps</a> landing at <a href="Tanahmerah%20Bay">Tanahmerah</a> and <a href="Yos%20Sudarso%20Bay">Humboldt</a> bays near <a href="Jayapura">Hollandia</a>, while the <a href="163rd%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">163rd Regimental Combat Team</a> landed at <a href="Aitape">Aitape</a>. Eichelberger was Krueger's most senior subordinate, but when he did not meet Krueger's expectation, Krueger let him know in no uncertain terms. "In my more than 40 years as an officer", Krueger told one of his staff, "I have never raised my voice to an enlisted man, but a corps commander should know better."
Krueger visited the beachhead with MacArthur and Eichelberger on the first day. After inspecting the beachhead, they went to the for ice cream sodas, whereupon MacArthur suggested, in view of the victory at Hollandia, they could accelerate the campaign timetable by moving on to Wakde-Sarmi immediately. Krueger was willing to consider the idea, although he had already ordered the troops designated for Wakde-Sarmi, the 32nd Infantry Division, to reinforce the position at Aitape, where he expected a major Japanese counterattack. Eichelberger was vehemently opposed, and the matter was dropped.

Krueger moved his headquarters to Hollandia in May 1944. The swampy area with its restricted anchorages proved unsuitable for a major airbase complex, although fighter strips were constructed, and it was developed as a staging area. MacArthur was compelled to press on with the Wakde-Sarmi project lest his troops become stranded without adequate air cover. A shortage of shipping meant that the operation had to be carried out by the troops in the Hollandia area, so Krueger nominated the 163rd Regimental Combat Team for Wakde, while the rest of the 41st Infantry Division captured Sarmi. However, with only days to go, doubts surfaced about the viability of construction in the Sarmi area, and <a href="Biak">Biak</a> was substituted. In view of the difficulties involved in changing plans, and moving the troops around, MacArthur agreed to postpone both operations, Wakde until 17 May and Biak to 27 May.

As a result, Alamo Force became involved in desperate fighting on three different fronts simultaneously. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Lone%20Tree%20Hill">landing at Wakde</a> was opposed by nearly twice as many Japanese troops than had been expected. When Krueger discovered that the Japanese were massing for an assault on the American position, he ordered a pre-emptive attack. "Krueger", wrote Edward Drea, "was too good a soldier to stand pat and wait for a Japanese attack." Official historian Robert Ross Smith noted that "This decision, based upon the scanty, incomplete information concerning Japanese strength and dispositions available to General Krueger at the time, was destined to precipitate a protracted and bitter fight." However, even if Krueger had known the true size of the Japanese force, he might still, under the circumstances, have taken the same approach.

The estimates of the number of Japanese troops on Biak were out by a similar margin, resulting in heavy casualties. In the <a href="Battle%20of%20Biak">Battle of Biak</a>, stubborn Japanese resistance halted the 41st Infantry Division, and forced its commander, Major General <a href="Horace%20H.%20Fuller">Horace H. Fuller</a>, to appeal to Krueger for reinforcements. In response, Krueger sent the 163rd Regimental Combat Team from Wakde. MacArthur soon grew impatient, as he needed the airstrips on Biak to support Admiral <a href="Chester%20Nimitz">Chester Nimitz</a>'s <a href="Invasion%20of%20Saipan">Invasion of Saipan</a>. Nimitz's operation ultimately drew Japanese attention away from Biak. MacArthur put pressure on Krueger for results, and Krueger in turn put pressure on Fuller. Krueger decided that Fuller had too many responsibilities as both task force commander and division commander, and decided to supersede him by sending Eichelberger to take over the task force. Fuller then submitted his resignation. Eichelberger's chief of staff, Brigadier General <a href="Clovis%20Byers">Clovis Byers</a>, offered to have Decker intercept and destroy the resignation before Krueger saw it, but Fuller decided against this. The battle raged for nearly a month. Afterwards, Krueger demanded an explanation from Eichelberger as to why he had allowed Fuller to quit.

Meanwhile, Japanese forces under Lieutenant General <a href="Hataz%C5%8D%20Adachi">Hatazō Adachi</a> attacked Alamo Force's position at Aitape in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Driniumor%20River">Battle of Driniumor River</a>. Krueger called for an energetic defense, but the cautious commander of <a href="XI%20Corps%20%28United%20States%29">XI Corps</a>, Major General <a href="Charles%20P.%20Hall">Charles P. Hall</a>, retained nine battalions around the airbase at <a href="Tadji%2C%20Papua%20New%20Guinea">Tadji</a>. This left Brigadier General Clarence A. Martin without the resources to implement Krueger's strategy, and he conducted a fighting withdrawal instead. Krueger travelled to Aitape where Hall presented him a counterattack plan, which he approved. By August, the fighting had ended and Adachi had been defeated.

MacArthur accelerated his timetable yet again in September 1944, and brought forward the planned <a href="invasion%20of%20Leyte">invasion of Leyte</a> to October 1944. That this was the worst time of the year for campaigning on Leyte was not overlooked. Typhoons and heavy rains hampered the efforts to construct and rehabilitate airbases, and without them, large numbers of aircraft could not operate from Leyte. This meant not only that few air strikes could be flown in support of the Sixth Army, but that the Allied Air Forces could not prevent the Japanese from reinforcing Leyte. An additional five Japanese divisions and two mixed brigades were sent to Leyte, and the battle became one of grinding attrition. Able to view his troops in action more often than hitherto, Krueger found much to criticize. He noted that tanks were employed poorly, that the infantry were not aggressive enough, and saw poor sanitation and meals as a sign that officers were not taking adequate care of their men. Krueger's generalship has also been questioned, with <a href="Ronald%20Spector">Ronald Spector</a> criticizing "Krueger's disastrous decision to delay the push into the mountains west of <a href="Carigara">Carigara</a> in favor of beach defense." Krueger based his cautious appreciation of the situation on various intelligence sources rather than relying solely on <a href="Ultra">Ultra</a>.

In January 1945, the Sixth Army embarked on its largest, longest and last campaign, the <a href="invasion%20of%20Luzon">invasion of Luzon</a>. Krueger intended to make "maximum utilization of America's materiel and industrial superiority". Once again, intelligence estimates of Japanese strength were questionable. MacArthur's intelligence officer, Brigadier General <a href="Charles%20A.%20Willoughby">Charles A. Willoughby</a>, basing his estimates on Ultra, believed that there were about 172,000 Japanese troops on Luzon. Krueger's intelligence officer, Colonel Horton V. White, reckoned that there were 234,000. MacArthur did not believe there were anywhere near that number. In fact, General <a href="Tomoyuki%20Yamashita">Tomoyuki Yamashita</a> had 287,000 troops on Luzon. For the first time since Louisiana in 1941, Krueger was able to maneuver his army as a single body instead of having elements employed on multiple battles on scattered islands. He regarded Yamashita's employment of armor as poor. Instead of using the <a href="2nd%20Tank%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">2nd Armored Division</a> for a decisive counterattack against the vulnerable flank, Yamashita frittered away its strength in piecemeal efforts.
As the campaign unfolded, Krueger was pressured by MacArthur to capture <a href="Manila">Manila</a>. He sent messages reporting what he saw was a lack of drive among the troops, and even moved his theater headquarters forward of Krueger's. MacArthur tried to exploit Krueger's rivalry with Eichelberger by allowing the latter's <a href="Eighth%20United%20States%20Army">Eighth Army</a> to conduct its own drive on Manila from the south. Krueger eventually sent a <a href="flying%20column">flying column</a> from the 1st Cavalry Division, but MacArthur's expectation that the Japanese would not defend Manila was proven incorrect. Weeks of ferocious fighting were required to capture the city.

Krueger was promoted to general on 5 March 1945. MacArthur recommended Krueger for the rank, even as he clashed with him over the drive on Manila, and rated Krueger's generalship higher than that of Patton or <a href="Omar%20Bradley">Omar Bradley</a>. Krueger's campaign on Luzon continued until 30 June 1945, when he handed over responsibility to Eichelberger in order to prepare for <a href="Operation%20Olympic">Operation Olympic</a>, the invasion of <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a>.

This proved unnecessary when <a href="Surrender%20of%20Japan">Japan surrendered</a>, and in September 1945 the Sixth Army took up occupation duty in Japan. Krueger established his headquarters in <a href="Kyoto">Kyoto</a>, and assumed responsibility for Kyushu, <a href="Shikoku">Shikoku</a> and southern Honshu. The Sixth Army remained in Japan until it handed over its occupation responsibilities to the Eighth Army on 31 December 1945. It was deactivated on 25 January 1946, and Krueger retired in July. For his service as commander of the Sixth Army in World War II, Krueger was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Distinguished Service Cross</a>, an <a href="oak%20leaf%20cluster">oak leaf cluster</a> to his Distinguished Service Medal, and the <a href="Navy%20Distinguished%20Service%20Medal">Navy Distinguished Service Medal</a>. He was awarded a second oak leaf cluster to his Distinguished Service Medal for his part in the <a href="Occupation%20of%20Japan">Occupation of Japan</a>.
Krueger retired to <a href="San%20Antonio%2C%20Texas">San Antonio, Texas</a>, where, in February 1946, he bought a house for the first time. Because of a large income tax bill left over from the war, he was unable to buy it outright and so some of his friends established the Krueger Fund Committee, which paid for much of the house. In retirement, Krueger was involved in a number of charity and community organizations, including the <a href="United%20Service%20Organization">United Service Organization</a>, the <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a>, and the <a href="National%20Foundation%20for%20Infantile%20Paralysis">National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis</a>, and he served as director of civil defense for San Antonio and <a href="Bexar%20County">Bexar County</a>.

Colonel Horton White, Krueger's former intelligence officer, approached him with an offer from <a href="George%20Edward%20Brett">George Edward Brett</a> of <a href="Macmillan%20Publishers%20%28United%20States%29">Macmillan</a> to publish his memoirs. Krueger did not wish to write an autobiography, which he felt was "invariably apt to be an apologia", but was willing to write up an account of the Sixth Army's exploits. He commenced work in 1947, but the project proceeded slowly. The result was "From Down Under to Nippon: The Story of the 6th Army In World War II", which was published in 1953. Historians were disappointed with the book, as it recounted what was known from the Sixth Army's reports, but provided little insight into the reasons why operations were conducted the way they were. Krueger kept in contact with his wartime colleagues. He was proud of the subsequent accomplishments of members of his wartime staff, and traveled to New York each year to celebrate MacArthur's birthday with MacArthur and other former senior commanders of the Southwest Pacific Area. He lectured at Army Schools and civic organizations, offering opinions on subjects such as the value of training, the benefit of universal military service, and the need for a unified defense establishment.

Krueger's retirement was marred by family tragedies. His son James was dismissed from the army in 1947 for <a href="conduct%20unbecoming%20an%20officer%20and%20a%20gentleman">conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman</a> after a drunken incident. Grace's health deteriorated, and she suffered from heart disease and high blood pressure. She was diagnosed with cancer in 1955, and died on 13 May 1956. Most dramatically, on 3 October 1952, a lonely and depressed Dorothy fatally stabbed her husband, Colonel Aubrey D. Smith, with a hunting knife while he slept in their Army quarters in Japan. Dorothy, who felt that her husband now regarded her no more than "a clinging handicap to his professional career", had turned to alcohol and drugs.

By six votes to three, a U.S. Army court-martial found Dorothy guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced her "to be confined at hard labor for the rest of her natural life". A unanimous verdict of guilty would have made the death sentence mandatory. She was flown back to the United States in a <a href="Military%20Air%20Transport%20Service">Military Air Transport Service</a> plane and was imprisoned at the <a href="Federal%20Prison%20Camp%2C%20Alderson">Federal Prison Camp, Alderson</a>, in West Virginia. The <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Military%20Appeals">United States Court of Military Appeals</a> rejected an appeal filed by Krueger's lawyers that argued that Dorothy was not sane at the time of the incident, and that the testimony that the court-martial had heard to the contrary was military rather than medical.

However, in 1955, in a similar case involving another woman, Mrs. Clarice B. Covert, who had killed her husband in England with an axe, Federal District Court Judge <a href="Edward%20A.%20Tamm">Edward A. Tamm</a> ruled that civilians who accompany military forces overseas could not be imprisoned by military courts. The two cases, "<a href="Kinsella%20v.%20Krueger">Kinsella v. Krueger</a>" and "<a href="Reid%20v.%20Covert">Reid v. Covert</a>", went to the <a href="US%20Supreme%20Court">US Supreme Court</a>, which affirmed that military trials of civilians were indeed constitutional, only to reverse itself a year later in a review of the decisions. Dorothy was released, and went to live with Krueger in San Antonio.

When his old friend Fay Babson wrote a letter in 1960 complaining about not being promoted before retirement, Krueger replied that:

Krueger's health began to decline in the late 1950s. He developed <a href="glaucoma">glaucoma</a> in his right eye, and <a href="sciatica">sciatica</a> in his left hip. In 1960, he had a <a href="hernia">hernia</a> operation, followed by kidney surgery in 1963. Nonetheless, he continued to attend MacArthur's birthday in New York. He died from <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> at <a href="Valley%20Forge%2C%20Pennsylvania">Valley Forge, Pennsylvania</a>, on 20 August 1967, and was buried in Section 30 of <a href="Arlington%20National%20Cemetery">Arlington National Cemetery</a>, among a number of family members. His papers are in the Cushing Memorial Library at <a href="Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20University">Texas A&M University</a>.

Although Krueger led a large force in operations over a large area for over two years, appearing on the cover of <a href="Time%20magazine">Time magazine</a> on 20 January 1945, and <a href="Krueger%20Middle%20School">Krueger Middle School</a> was named after him in San Antonio, Texas, in 1962, he never became a well-known figure like MacArthur. Krueger's forte was what is today termed the <a href="operational%20level%20of%20war">operational level of war</a>, transforming MacArthur's strategic vision into reality. Krueger has usually been characterised as "an overly cautious commander who impeded MacArthur's fast-paced strategy." <a href="William%20Manchester">William Manchester</a> speculated that "the General knew his plodding subordinate was a useful counterweight to his own bravura", and Edward Drea noted that at the Battle of the Drinumor, Krueger's actions were "entirely out of keeping with his otherwise methodical and plodding generalship". MacArthur wrote:

Klepacki is currently the audio director of <a href="Petroglyph%20%28game%20studio%29">Petroglyph</a> games, where he scored "". Klepacki was contacted to score "", but was too busy with Petroglyph to take the project, and declined to mention the offer. Klepacki composed three songs, including "Hell March 3", for "" by <a href="EA%20Los%20Angeles">EA Los Angeles</a>. His solo CD entitled "<a href="Viratia%20%28album%29">Viratia</a>" is packaged with a comic he helped produce.

Klepacki was raised by a family of musicians of <a href="Polish%20Americans">Polish</a> and <a href="Italian%20Americans">Italian</a> descent who played on the Las Vegas strip. He drew art as a hobby, but music prevailed in his early interests. He received his first <a href="drumset">drumset</a> at age 8 and began performing professionally by age 11. Among his early influences were <a href="electronica">electronica</a> and <a href="Heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a> groups, including <a href="Depeche%20Mode">Depeche Mode</a>, <a href="Afrika%20Bambaataa">Afrika Bambaataa</a>, <a href="AC/DC">AC/DC</a>, and <a href="Iron%20Maiden">Iron Maiden</a>. Seeking to master <a href="guitar">guitar</a>, <a href="bass%20guitar">bass</a>, and <a href="keyboard%20instrument">keyboard</a>s, he formed local bands and created a <a href="demo%20tape">demo tape</a> of original material by age 17. His impetus for diversifying his instrumental abilities was "not being able to communicate with other band members on ideas...for original songs." His first piece of audio gear was a <a href="TASCAM">TASCAM</a> 4-track cassette recorder, which he used to record demos, band practices, and live shows.

After learning to program <a href="BASIC">BASIC</a> on a <a href="Tandy%201000">Tandy 1000</a> and becoming interested in <a href="video%20game">computer and video games</a>, he applied for a job as a <a href="game%20tester">game tester</a> at Westwood studios. He submitted his demo tape—described as "an acoustic guitar song with electric guitar leads and keyboard strings, and raining sound effects"—to the company's audio director. The growing company enlisted him as a composer for the <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">NES</a> port of "<a href="DragonStrike%20%28computer%20game%29">DragonStrike</a>" and the computer game "<a href="Eye%20of%20the%20Beholder%20II">Eye of the Beholder II</a>". He later composed with <a href="MIDI">MIDI</a> sequencing for several other "<a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons">Dungeons & Dragons</a>" games. In 1992, he helmed the audio of "<a href="Dune%20II">Dune II</a>", attempting to complement the music of the original "<a href="Dune%20%28computer%20game%29">Dune</a>". He later noted that he pushed the sequencing program on his <a href="Amiga">Amiga</a> to the limit while scoring the game. While working on "<a href="The%20Lion%20King%23Video%20games">Disney's The Lion King</a>" in 1994, he and the Westwood team were shown sketches of the unfinished feature film. Film composer <a href="Hans%20Zimmer">Hans Zimmer</a> later praised Klepacki for reworking his scores. After finishing the third entry into "<a href="The%20Legend%20of%20Kyrandia">The Legend of Kyrandia</a>" series; "<a href="Malcolm%27s%20Revenge">Malcolm's Revenge</a>", Frank Klepacki met with Westwood leaders to discuss the upcoming game "<a href="Command%20%26amp%3B%20Conquer">Command & Conquer</a>"—the first in a series which would bring him wider fame and critical acclaim.

In 1994, Klepacki met with Westwood Studios developers to discuss the soundtrack of the company's next project—"Command & Conquer". To define the game's style, Klepacki listened to a number of bands, including <a href="Nine%20Inch%20Nails">Nine Inch Nails</a> and <a href="Ministry%20%28band%29">Ministry</a>, which would supply the iconic <a href="industrial%20music">industrial</a> style found in the majority of the songs. He combined various elements of this music and added his own touch to create a unique sound. With the company's recent shift to 22 <a href="Hertz">kHz</a> audio, Klepacki composed with an ASR-10 sampler, a <a href="Roland%20Corporation">Roland</a> S760 sampler, a Roland JD 990 synth module, and an <a href="electric%20guitar">electric guitar</a>. The first few songs he composed for "Command & Conquer" contained voice samples—including the notable pieces "Act on Instinct" and "No Mercy" (which featured wild declarations from "<a href="Bill%20%26amp%3B%20Ted%27s%20Bogus%20Journey">Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey</a>"). The samples were later found to interfere with the game's spoken audio, and were replaced with versions lacking the voices, although the original versions (and several other unused pieces) can still be found on the DOS "C&C" and "Covert Operations" discs. Complete versions of the songs later appeared on the game's commercial soundtrack. He would continue to sample clips from film and other media throughout his career, using a quote from "<a href="The%20Brain%20from%20Planet%20Arous">The Brain from Planet Arous</a>" in the "Yuri's Revenge" soundtrack "Brainfreeze", for example. Klepacki next composed instrumental pieces for "Command & Conquer", drawing influences from <a href="orchestra">orchestra</a>l, <a href="house%20music">house</a>, <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a>, and <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop music</a>. For the <a href="credit%20%28creative%20arts%29">credits</a>, Klepacki wrote "Airstrike", featuring a hook later used in "" for the <a href="Global%20Defense%20Initiative">Global Defense Initiative</a>. Conversely, the <a href="Brotherhood%20of%20Nod">Brotherhood of Nod</a> ending used the song "Destructible Times" written by Klepacki's local band, <a href="I%20Am%20%28American%20band%29">I AM</a>. Developers requested the song because it "reflected the war aspect and bad-ass vibe of Nod's side." The "C&C" expansion pack "The Covert Operations" featured seven new <a href="ambient%20music">ambient</a> pieces, all of which were also included on the disc in high quality <a href="Red%20Book%20%28audio%20CD%20standard%29">CD Audio</a> format. Though the soundtrack was not released through retail, Westwood sold it by special order through its website and in game catalogues.

While working on "Covert Operations", Klepacki composed "Hell March" from the idea of "a rock tune to marching boots," finishing the song in one day after inventing the guitar riff. Upon listening, director <a href="Brett%20Sperry">Brett Sperry</a> insisted this song be used as the signature theme of "Command & Conquer: Red Alert." Originally intended for use with the Brotherhood of Nod, it features militaristic samples—including marching, industrial sounds, and a commander shouting orders. Klepacki initially scored "Red Alert" with sci-fi camp in mind, but early songs were shelved. He switched gears to write gritty pieces, prompting the "Red Alert" team to expand upon the style of "Command & Conquer". In preparing to compose, Klepacki acquired new sample libraries for unique and strange sounds. Particular creative moods would result in a few songs at a time. He first wrote heavy songs like "Workmen" and "Crush", then composed neutral, synthesizer-laden music, such as "Vector" and "Roll Out". Klepacki scored "Fogger" and "Mud", one of his personal favorites, before finishing with "Militant Force" and "Radio 2". He took breaks from working to make cameo appearances as a Soviet soldier killed by <a href="Kane%20%28Command%20%26amp%3B%20Conquer%29">Kane</a> and an Allied commander in the <a href="cut%20scene">cut scene</a>s of "Red Alert". He previously appeared as a <a href="Brotherhood%20of%20Nod">Nod</a> soldier and the voice of the commando in "Command & Conquer" and would voice bit parts in future Westwood games.

After completing "Red Alert", he took a short break to review his work. He concluded that some songs could be enhanced, but "Red Alert" had already gone <a href="Software%20release%20life%20cycle%23Release%20to%20manufacturing%20%28RTM%29">gold</a>, precluding new versions. These remixes later appeared on the unsuccessful "Command & Conquer: Sole Survivor". "Red Alert"s soundtrack was voted best video game soundtrack of 1996 by "<a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a>" and "Gameslice "magazines, defeating <a href="Trent%20Reznor">Trent Reznor</a>'s score for "<a href="Quake%20%28video%20game%29">Quake</a>". Reviewers called it "fun to listen to" and "second to none." As of 2005, "Red Alert" was listed in the "<a href="Guinness%20Book%20of%20World%20Records">Guinness Book of World Records</a>" for selling several million units, bringing Klepacki his widest audience. He wrote additional music for the game's <a href="expansion%20pack">expansion pack</a>s, "Counterstrike" and "Aftermath". He attributed the success of "Red Alert" to an infusion of modern styles not found in other games. Klepacki initially wrote off the popularity of his music, assuming that his music "must only appeal to die-hards." He considered it "very surreal" to realize his soundtracks had gained notoriety, and has since embraced his fans and critics.

In 1997, Klepacki scored a "<a href="Blade%20Runner">Blade Runner</a>" adaptation. Though Westwood acquired the rights to use the original film score by <a href="Vangelis">Vangelis</a>, the company was not allowed access to the original master recordings, and Klepacki had to recreate the themes by ear. Developers were satisfied by his attention to detail, feeling that his digital recreations sounded clearer than the originals. In 1998, Klepacki composed for "<a href="Dune%202000">Dune 2000</a>". He attempted to update the music from "<a href="Dune%20II">Dune II</a>" into "this non-blip stuff," and worked in homages to the original style of the films as composed by <a href="Toto%20%28band%29">Toto</a>. "Dune 2000" was panned by critics, though Klepacki's score was praised for adhering to the traditional "Dune" style. Klepacki considered "2000" to be a more definitive work than "Dune 2", which was constrained by software and hardware limitations. He composed for "" with <a href="Jarrid%20Mendelson">Jarrid Mendelson</a>—with whom he would later collaborate on "". He began by writing "Stomp", an energetic rock piece intended to recreate the effect of "Hell March" for the new game. Coincidentally, one of the trailers for Command and Conquer 3 featured 'Stomp' as the soundtrack. Westwood instead wanted "Tiberian Sun" to feature darker, more moody music, and "Stomp" was shelved in favor of the current sound. Bereft of ideas due to the stark change in direction, Klepacki asked Mendelson to collaborate; he regards tracks they both worked on as the best. "Tiberian Sun" ultimately featured dark, ambient <a href="techno%20music">techno music</a> and ambient space music suited to the game's post-apocalyptic and futuristic setting. Klepacki cited the piece "Mad Rap" as his favorite. An avid "<a href="Star%20Wars">Star Wars</a>" fan, he enjoyed scoring <a href="cut%20scenes">cut scenes</a> featuring <a href="James%20Earl%20Jones">James Earl Jones</a>, the voice of <a href="Darth%20Vader">Darth Vader</a>. The scenes also allowed him to integrate the "Airstrike" and "No Mercy" themes into the game's score despite the aforementioned shift. With the expansion pack "Firestorm", he attempted to "set things right" by writing more upbeat songs and including "Stomp", which would also appear in "Command & Conquer: Renegade".

He next scored "<a href="Lands%20of%20Lore">Lands of Lore</a> III" and "". Klepacki defined "Red Alert 2"s style with heavy metal guitar and fast-paced beats. Klepacki scored the game with a <a href="Korg">Korg</a> TR Rack, <a href="Novation">Novation</a> Nova desktop, and <a href="Roland%20Corporation">Roland</a> XV-5080. "Red Alert 2" included a remix of "Hell March". The return to high-energy songs was owed in part to fan criticism of "Tiberian Sun". Klepacki maintained the energetic style in "Red Alert 2"s expansion pack "Yuri's Revenge". For ""—the next entry in the series—Klepacki tried to update the style of the original "Command & Conquer" by making it "hipper and more elaborate." Several "Command & Conquer" mainstays appear as reworked versions, including "Target (Mechanical Man)", "Industrial", "Act on Instinct", and "No Mercy". The main theme's melody comes from "C&C 80's Mix", a piece composed for "Covert Operations" but scrapped before release. Klepacki's last contribution to <a href="Westwood%20Studios">Westwood Studios</a> was the music of "<a href="Earth%20%26amp%3B%20Beyond">Earth & Beyond</a>", comprising four albums of material. Acquired by <a href="Electronic%20Arts">Electronic Arts</a> in 1998, Westwood was liquidated in 2002 and the remaining employees were relocated to <a href="EA%20Los%20Angeles">EA Los Angeles</a>. Several Westwood founders left the company. Though Klepacki offered to score "" and submitted a demo to EA, he was not contacted to compose. When asked in 2002 whether he'd continue scoring music after ten years in the business, he exclaimed, "ten down, next ten to go!" After Westwood's closure, he reflected on his past work at a dinner held by Joseph Kucan and other former employees.

Klepacki took a brief hiatus to work on solo albums, then joined <a href="Petroglyph%20Games">Petroglyph Games</a> as full-time audio director in 2004. He prepared by becoming versed in the job's requirements and demands. His first task was scoring "", Petroglyph's launch title; he also helped select voice actors. A die-hard fan of the "<a href="Star%20Wars">Star Wars</a>" franchise, Klepacki enjoyed complementing <a href="John%20Williams">John Williams</a>'s style as he worked with sound effects used in the feature films. He worked closely with programmers to ensure perfect aural functionality. Though most the game's score is John Williams's work, Klepacki estimates that he contributed 20% original material. Apart from the main theme, he aimed to minimize his editing in order to retain the classic "Star Wars" sound. He chiefly composed for new areas of the "Star Wars" universe only found in "Empire at War". He calls his work on the game "the peak of my career," and felt he had spent his entire life grooming his abilities for that soundtrack. As a perk of composing, he visited <a href="Skywalker%20Ranch">Skywalker Ranch</a> and <a href="Industrial%20Light%20and%20Magic">Industrial Light and Magic</a>, and took pride in having his name associated with an official "Star Wars" product.
For the "Forces of Corruption" expansion pack, he took greater creative liberty with the "Star Wars" feel by writing an original theme for the new criminal faction. In attempting to compose this piece, he wrote several preliminary hooks that were later integrated into the game's battle themes. He composed six pieces for the expansion total, including the finale theme. In line with the criminal theme of the game, Klepacki borrowed motifs and recreated the mood from scenes involving <a href="Jabba%20the%20Hutt">Jabba the Hutt</a> in "<a href="Return%20of%20the%20Jedi">Return of the Jedi</a>". His score for the expansion pack was accepted upon first submission to <a href="LucasArts">LucasArts</a>. As Petroglyph's audio director, he also selected sound effects—a tricky process due to the issue of making the criminal faction's sounds a "little different, without straying too much from the original signature sounds." Klepacki worked with LucasArts to select voice actors, and contributed his own talents to the role of <a href="IG-88">IG-88</a> and other minor characters. A <a href="blooper">blooper</a> reel of his voice acting was released on Petroglyph's forums after the one-thousandth member registered. Klepacki was contacted to score "<a href="Command%20%26amp%3B%20Conquer%203">Command & Conquer 3</a>", but was too busy with duties at Petroglyph and declined to mention the offer publicly. Electronic Arts hired <a href="Steve%20Jablonsky">Steve Jablonsky</a> to score the game; an EA community manager at "C&C 3"'s forums suggested that the audio team studied Klepacki's music and tried to recreate his style. Klepacki feels that "Command & Conquer" is a significant part of his life and that he would like to return to the "Tiberian" era. He conceded that employment at Petroglyph games would probably prevent him from working with Electronic Arts. Years later in 2018 he would have that opportunity due to EA partnering with Petroglyph to remaster the games since many of the former developers from Westwood Studios had started, and continue to work at, Petroglyph.

Klepacki's next project was a game collaboration by <a href="SEGA">SEGA</a> and Petroglyph named "". As of December 2006, he had composed several songs for various factions and enjoyed the "opportunity to create something new again, not based on...existing intellectual property. Klepacki "began by taking into account what songs were identified as fan favorites in...past related work". He was interviewed about the creative process on March 27, 2007 by Kevin Yu, a Petroglyph community manager, and provided a detailed tour of his studio at the company. His office included one of the fastest computers at Petroglyph and a vocal booth where unit responses and other vocalizations were tested and tweaked before voice actors performed finishing work. Klepacki was glad that Universe of War did not demand strict obedience to a particular style. He declared that surprises were in store for "Command & Conquer" fans waiting for him to return to his "roots" and "adrenaline-pumping soundtrack style", and suggested that they "imagine my mindset...when Command & Conquer first came out, and add about fifteen years experience to that." Klepacki summarized the game's main styles shortly before release:

As audio director, Klepacki also created many sound effects for "Universe at War". For the alien Hierarchy, he cultivated an "unnatural" aesthetic through an "arsenal of mangled noises". Klepacki used a "combination of heavy cranes recorded with overdriven impacts" to give the faction's walkers a "menacing machinelike breathing sound", and made up his own language to record "various grunts, growls, mannerisms, and strange vocalizations. Since Hierarchy heroes needed to communicate to the player in English, Klepacki engineered dialogue to seem as if the aliens were "telepathically speaking to you, with a back-masking effect on their voices...as if the words are being channeled straight to your brain". The Novus effects were usually <a href="phaser%20%28effect%29">phased</a> and involved "mechanical movement, electricity, and metal sounds". He invented yet another language for two characters Viktor and Mirabel, who occasionally speak to one another. Lastly, he drew on weather and other natural sounds for the Masari, describing their ambience as having "more weight, thunder, heavy bass rumblings, vortex gusts..." Klepacki directed the voice-acting to have a "noble and strong" feel without appearing typically medieval or overly dramatic. He ultimately felt he did the work of "three people" with "Universe at War", as the game's audio requirements changed constantly, requiring vigilance and programmer support. "Divine Intervention" was later nominated for a "Game Audio Network Guild" award, and the soundtrack was released as a free download after Petroglyph's efforts toward a traditional release were frustrated.

Klepacki next composed three songs for "", including "Hell March 3". "Hell March 3" was recorded with the aid of a 4-piece rock band alongside the Skywalker Symphony Orchestra and Choir at the Skywalker Sound scoring stage; the choir also sang in <a href="Russian%20language">Russian</a> for an updated version of "Grinder" from "Red Alert 2". He remarked in 2008 that he would never grow tired of "Hell March", and was thankful it had resonated with so many fans. Around this time, he composed using "<a href="Cubase">Cubase</a>", "<a href="Kontakt%20%28software%29">Kontakt</a>", a "<a href="Mark%20of%20the%20Unicorn">MOTU</a>" 2408 audio interface, and several instruments. Collaborating with <a href="Video%20Games%20Live">Video Games Live</a>, Klepacki performed "Hell March" and its "Red Alert 2" version in Las Vegas in 2008, and later performed "Hell March 3" in the Netherlands with a choir and orchestra through the "Games in Concert" series; he wore a Soviet army conscript uniform for the song. Klepacki expressed a desire in 2009 to score an "<a href="Unreal%20Tournament">Unreal Tournament</a>" series game and a "generation one-style" "<a href="Transformers">Transformers</a>" game, as well as a blockbuster movie.

Klepacki has also played in and produced albums for several Las Vegas bands. <a href="I%20Am%20%28American%20band%29">I AM</a>'s "<a href="There%27s%20a%20Home">There's a Home</a>" is his first full-length CD appearance. The band featured Greg Greer on vocals, Rod Arnett on bass, Dan Ryan on guitar, and Klepacki on drums. Formed from the rhythm section of local band "Shatterbone", I AM released one album in 1995 and broke up. Described as <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative</a> <a href="progressive%20rock">progressive rock</a>, the band's music drew influences from <a href="Tool%20%28band%29">Tool</a> and <a href="Soundgarden">Soundgarden</a>. The song "Destructible Times" was used for the Brotherhood of Nod ending in the original "Command & Conquer". After the break-up, Klepacki joined <a href="Home%20Cookin%27%20%28band%29">Home Cookin'</a>, a ten-member ensemble which played funk and soul in the tradition of <a href="Tower%20of%20Power">Tower of Power</a>. Founded in 1989, Home Cookin' commercially debuted with "<a href="Mmm%2C%20Mmm%2C%20Mmm%2C">Mmm, Mmm, Mmm,</a>" in 1997 (which featured a number one hit) and released a second album ("<a href="Pink%20in%20the%20Middle">Pink in the Middle</a>") in 2000 before disbanding following a tour in California. Towards the end of its run, the band played at Quark's Bar in and at the Boston Grill and Bar. The group sometimes opened shows with a four-member <a href="funk">funk</a> act named "Junkfood". Home Cookin' was popular by readers of Las Vegas Weekly, winning several awards over its history—including "Best Horns" in a band. Klepacki boasted that turnout for the band at clubs was usually above four hundred people. In 2003, he formed "The Bitters", a trio composed of Klepacki, bassist Vinny Moncada, and guitarist Jeff Murphy. With a style described as metal and <a href="jazz%20fusion">jazz fusion</a>, the group has released one album as of August 2006. Klepacki is also member to the group "Mo Friction", supported by former Home Cookin' members. Their debut album will mark Klepacki's first outing as a band's lead <a href="vocals">vocalist</a>.

Klepacki's solo work debuted in 2002 with "<a href="Morphscape">Morphscape</a>". Production began in 1996 with the song "Cybertek", though an album was not planned at this time. The rest of "Morphscape"s songs were composed after "Red Alert 2". Klepacki composed the album's title track while working on "Command & Conquer: Renegade", and feels the game's style is visibly present in "Morphscape". Klepacki released the final product after Westwood's dissolution. His biggest inspiration in creating solo works is the legion of fans interested in "Command & Conquer". Klepacki took a hiatus from composing video game music to write two other solo albums, the first of which is entitled "<a href="Rocktronic">Rocktronic</a>". Released in 2004, the album was described as dark, edgy, and heavy in a way that will appeal to "Command & Conquer" fans. Klepacki sought out specific samples and instruments used in the Command & Conquer soundtrack for use in the release; the title "Rocktronic" was an attempt to name his style of music. Featuring live drumming in certain songs, the album is Klepacki's best-seller. Following "Rocktronic" was "<a href="Virtual%20Control">Virtual Control</a>", released in 2005. Klepacki complemented his usual style with experiments in hip hop on the album. Tracks from each release have been periodically used in "<a href="The%20Ultimate%20Fighter">The Ultimate Fighter</a>", along with certain custom themes written for the show.

On August 1, 2006, he revealed his next solo project would be named "<a href="Awakening%20of%20Aggression">Awakening of Aggression</a>" and confirmed the music would be "heavy" and "hard-hitting." When interviewed, Klepacki said that he channeled stress into the heavy music of the new album. "Aggression" was released in October of the same year, and was made available on <a href="iTunes">iTunes</a> on December 7. He filled the liner notes of the album with the names of several supportive fans who had purchased his music. As of April 2007, he speculates that a new solo release will be ready by the end of the year. After establishing recognition on "Ultimate Fighter", Klepacki began scoring themes for <a href="HDNet">HDNet</a>'s "Inside the MMA" and "HDNet Fights" in autumn 2007. Around this time, he made it to the district finals of the <a href="Guitar%20Center">Guitar Center</a> "drum-off" competition after winning two store challenges in Las Vegas but was eliminated. His solo album "<a href="Infiltrator%20%28album%29">Infiltrator</a>" was released in April 2009. According to Klepacki, the album was inspired by his recent work on the Red Alert series. Klepacki enjoys Las Vegas thanks to its diversity of musical talent and prolific number of shows and attractions. He attributes his showmanship to being raised in the city, noting that one has to "stand out" to be noticed among the entertainment atmosphere of Vegas. The city's "Las Vegas Weekly" honored him as a "badass composer" in its mid-April 2009 issue, highlighting his prolific fan-base and work as producer for various local bands.

When composing for video games, Klepacki spends a few days to compose and master one song on average. He feels writing music for games is somewhat difficult as only early <a href="software%20build">software build</a>s are available to play; he sometimes must compose songs based on vague descriptions. Composing for cut scenes is easier by comparison, and Klepacki enjoys drawing inspiration and direction from game design art. Nonetheless, he prefers to compose for a game throughout its development rather than write songs for a finished product. He feels that game music has been harder to compose than film or solo music as he must compose for all situations a player may discover or engineer. Klepacki maintains templates with a base of common instruments prepared for sudden bursts of inspiration, as he resents "having technical issues...as an obstacle." When asked how the composing process begins, Klepacki related:

Klepacki has said that the most rewarding part of composing video game music is working with a team—which he compares to chemistry between band members—and knowing he is part of a greater cause. He believes that game music could improve if artists focused on quality and derived inspiration from playing games. He has expressed interest in having Electronic Arts sell his soundtracks in retail stores, preferably next to video games in electronic departments. He advises those wishing to get in the video game business to attend conventions and investigate developer companies. He also noted in 2008 that "composition and engineering skills are now required," advising upstart composers to ensure their work is film-quality. Klepacki is happy to see older games offered on the <a href="Wii">Wii</a>, hoping that gamers are "recognizing once again that simple, short fun experiences are just as good as...long, huge-production experiences." Klepacki listed several influences for his style of composition: "John Williams naturally for my love of Star Wars and his style in general, Michael Kamen for his composing diversity, Metallica for sparking my metal influence, Vince Dicola who in my opinion is way under-rated for his great work, Sly & The Family Stone for inspiring funk, syncopation, and positive energy, Larry Graham for inspiring me to play funk bass, Nine Inch Nails for their unique uses of mangled sound, and Rob Zombie for combining music with a theme and persona."
Klepacki runs a personal <a href="http%3A//www.frankklepacki.com/">website</a> featuring a biography, archived interviews, and a playlist of songs <a href="streaming%20media">streamed</a> in 128 <a href="Kilobit%20per%20second">kbit/s</a> <a href="mp3">mp3</a>. His music is also available from <a href="iTunes">iTunes</a>. As a "Star Wars" fan, he has extensively written about the film premieres of the last two prequels on his website. He maintains an account at <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> and has posted three videos of his work with other bands. He is an ardent supporter of <a href="digital%20cinema">digital cinema</a>, believing the medium to be the pinnacle of quality. He has scored two short films, and won a <a href="CineVegas">CineVegas</a> award for his work with "Unreel Invasion". Klepacki believes that the genre of video game music is more respected than it has ever been. He notes that complex and quality music comes at a higher cost, prompting certain producers to simply "get somebody who could cop the Hollywood sound" instead of nurturing original style. When asked about his career low-point, he named "<a href="Order%20of%20the%20Griffon">Order of the Griffon</a>" for the <a href="TurboGrafx-16">TurboGrafx-16</a>, citing difficulties with the system's limited musical capabilities. Concerning his solo career and Westwood, Klepacki regrets "not having attended more of the fun company functions and parties while I was instead playing club gigs with bands with the mentality of trying to get signed or discovered." When asked to reflect on his career, he replied:

Klepacki is not seeking a record deal, citing a "horrible chain of steps to getting famous." Scathingly critical of the <a href="recording%20industry">recording industry</a>, he blames <a href="MTV">MTV</a>—described as a "teenage
reality show channel"—for putting a pretty face on music and destroying the independent valuation of actual sound. Klepacki has declared pop music as having become the "largest farce in music history—soul-less, mechanical, and only made for the sole purpose of making the fastest dollar possible, with more emphasis on imagery than the music." He's also criticized <a href="lip-synching">lip-synching</a> and the repackaging of music genre through different labels—such as <a href="Nu%20metal">Nu metal</a> for <a href="rock%20music">rock music</a> and <a href="Neo%20soul">Neo soul</a> for <a href="soul%20music">soul music</a>. He believes that signing a deal does not guarantee profits, and would rather keep his <a href="day%20job">day job</a> as audio director. These sentiments were echoed in a special feature on the band <a href="Home%20Cookin%27%20%28band%29">Home Cookin'</a> in 2000—Klepacki said the group wanted to "work with a label, not for them." Stating that he would not compromise his work for popularity, he believes that "the only artists that have any longevity are the ones that pioneer a movement—not follow one." He enjoys working independently, as he does not have to "change...music for the sake of pop radio." He champions the internet as a medium through which creative and original artists can be found. Klepacki believes it is the preferred avenue for music when compared to radio <a href="airplay%20%28song%29">airplay</a>—where one hears "the exact same songs 3 months at a time." When interviewed about file-sharing, he expressed mixed emotions. Holding that <a href="compact%20disc">compact disc</a>s are "just too damn expensive", Klepacki believes that a few dollars' reduction in price would "deter people from downloading for free." Conversely, he notes that artists—who "don't get as much money as you think"—need to be compensated for their work. His favorite artists by decade, starting with the 1960s, are <a href="Sly%20and%20the%20Family%20Stone">Sly and the Family Stone</a>, <a href="Graham%20Central%20Station">Graham Central Station</a>, <a href="Metallica">Metallica</a>, <a href="Home%20Cookin%27%20%28band%29">Home Cookin'</a>, and <a href="Bob%20Schneider">Bob Schneider</a>.

The site flourished in the <a href="Mesoamerican%20chronology">Preclassic</a> and <a href="Mesoamerican%20chronology">Classic</a> periods, from the 9th century BC through to at least the 10th century AD, and was an important <a href="Trade%20in%20Maya%20civilization">centre of commerce</a>, trading with <a href="Kaminaljuyu">Kaminaljuyu</a> and <a href="Chocol%C3%A1">Chocolá</a>. Investigations have revealed that it is one of the largest sites with <a href="monumental%20sculpture">sculptured monuments</a> on the Pacific coastal plain. Olmec-style sculptures include a possible <a href="Olmec%20colossal%20heads">colossal head</a>, <a href="petroglyph">petroglyph</a>s and others. The site has one of the greatest concentrations of Olmec-style sculpture outside of the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>.

Takalik Abaj is representative of the first blossoming of Maya culture that had occurred by about 400 BC. The site includes a Maya royal tomb and examples of <a href="Maya%20script">Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions</a> that are among the earliest from the Maya region. Excavation is continuing at the site; the monumental <a href="Maya%20architecture">architecture</a> and persistent tradition of sculpture in a variety of styles suggest the site was of some importance.

Finds from the site indicate contact with the distant metropolis of <a href="Teotihuacan">Teotihuacan</a> in the <a href="Valley%20of%20Mexico">Valley of Mexico</a> and imply that Takalik Abaj was conquered by it or its allies. Takalik Abaj was linked to long-distance <a href="trade%20in%20Maya%20civilization">Maya trade routes</a> that shifted over time but allowed the city to participate in a trade network that included the <a href="Guatemalan%20highlands">Guatemalan highlands</a> and the Pacific coastal plain from <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> to <a href="El%20Salvador">El Salvador</a>.

Takalik Abaj was a sizeable city with the principal <a href="Mesoamerican%20architecture">architecture</a> clustered into four main groups spread across nine terraces. While some of these were natural features, others were artificial constructions requiring an enormous investment in labour and materials. The site featured a sophisticated water drainage system and a wealth of sculptured monuments.

"Tak'alik Ab'aj<nowiki>'</nowiki>" means "standing stone" in the local <a href="K%27iche%27%20language">K'iche' Maya language</a>, combining the adjective "tak'alik" meaning "standing", and the noun "abäj" meaning "stone" or "rock". It was initially named "Abaj Takalik" by the American archaeologist <a href="Suzanna%20Miles">Suzanna Miles</a>, using Spanish word order. This was grammatically incorrect in K'iche'; the Guatemalan government has now officially corrected this to "Tak'alik Ab'aj"'. Anthropologist Ruud Van Akkeren has proposed that the ancient name of the city was Kooja, the name of one of the highest-ranking elite lineages of the <a href="Mam%20people">Mam</a> Maya; "Kooja" means "Moon halo".

The site lies in the southwest of <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>, about from the border with the Mexican state of <a href="Chiapas">Chiapas</a> and from the Pacific Ocean.

Takalik Abaj is located in the north of the <a href="Municipalities%20of%20Guatemala">municipality</a> of <a href="El%20Asintal">El Asintal</a>, in the extreme north of <a href="Retalhuleu%20Department">Retalhuleu</a> <a href="Departments%20of%20Guatemala">department</a>, some from <a href="Guatemala%20City">Guatemala City</a>. The site lies among five coffee plantations in the lower foothills of the <a href="Sierra%20Madre%20de%20Chiapas">Sierra Madre</a> mountains; the Santa Margarita, San Isidro Piedra Parada, Buenos Aires, San Elías and Dolores plantations. Takalik Abaj sits upon a ridge running north–south, descending in a southwards direction. This ridge is bordered on the west by the <a href="Nim%C3%A1%20River">Nimá River</a> and on the east by the <a href="Ixchay%C3%A1%20River">Ixchayá River</a>, both flowing down from the <a href="Guatemalan%20Highlands">Guatemalan Highlands</a>. The Ixchayá flows in a deep ravine but a suitable crossing point is located near to the site. The situation of Takalik Abaj at this crossing point was probably important in the founding of the city, since this channeled important trade routes through the site and controlled access to them.

Takalik Abaj sits at an altitude of approximately above sea level in an <a href="ecoregion">ecoregion</a> classed as <a href="subtropical%20moist%20forest">subtropical moist forest</a>. The temperature normally varies between and the <a href="Evapotranspiration%23Potential%20evapotranspiration">potential evapotranspiration ratio</a> averages 0.45. The area receives high annual rainfall, varying between , with an average annual rainfall of . Local vegetation includes the Pascua de Montaña ("<a href="Pogonopus%20speciosus">Pogonopus speciosus</a>"), Chichique ("<a href="Aspidosperma%20megalocarpon">Aspidosperma megalocarpon</a>"), Tepecaulote ("<a href="Luehea%20speciosa">Luehea speciosa</a>"), Caulote or West Indian Elm ("<a href="Guazuma%20ulmifolia">Guazuma ulmifolia</a>"), Hormigo ("<a href="Platymiscium%20dimorphandrum">Platymiscium dimorphandrum</a>"), Mexican Cedar ("<a href="Cedrela%20odorata">Cedrela odorata</a>"), Breadnut ("<a href="Brosimum%20alicastrum">Brosimum alicastrum</a>"), <a href="Tamarind">Tamarind</a> ("Tamarindus indica") and Papaturria ("<a href="Coccoloba%20montana">Coccoloba montana</a>").

A road, denominated 6W, passes the site running from the town of <a href="Retalhuleu">Retalhuleu</a> to <a href="Colomba">Colomba Costa Cuca</a> in the department of <a href="Quetzaltenango%20%28department%29">Quetzaltenango</a>.

Takalik Abaj is located at an approximate distance of from the contemporary archaeological site of <a href="Monte%20Alto%20culture">Monte Alto</a>, from <a href="Kaminaljuyu">Kaminaljuyu</a> and from <a href="Izapa">Izapa</a> in Mexico.

The changing styles of architecture and iconography at Takalik Abaj suggest that the site has been occupied by changing ethnic groups. The archaeological finds of the Middle Preclassic period suggest that the population of Takalik Abaj may have been affiliated with the <a href="Olmec">Olmec</a> culture of the <a href="Olmec%20heartland">Gulf Coast lowlands region</a> who are thought to have been speakers of a <a href="Mixe%E2%80%93Zoque%20languages">Mixe–Zoquean language</a>. In the Late Preclassic period, Olmec art styles were exchanged for Maya styles and presumably this shift was accompanied by an influx of ethnic Maya, speaking a <a href="Mayan%20languages">Mayan language</a>. There are some hints from the indigenous chronicles that the inhabitants of the site may have been the Yoc Cancheb, a branch of the Mam Maya. The Kooja lineage of the Mam, an ancient noble line, may have had a Classic Period origin in Takalik Abaj.

Takalik Abaj was one of a series of early sites on or near the <a href="Soconusco">Pacific coastal plain</a> that were important commercial, ceremonial and political centres. It is apparent that it prospered from the production of <a href="Cocoa%20bean">cacao</a> and from the <a href="trade%20in%20Maya%20civilization">trade routes</a> that crossed the region. At the time of the <a href="Spanish%20conquest%20of%20Guatemala">Spanish Conquest</a> in the 16th century the area was still important for its cacao production.

Study of <a href="Obsidian%20use%20in%20Mesoamerica">obsidian</a> recovered at Takalik Abaj indicates that the majority originated from the <a href="El%20Chayal">El Chayal</a> and <a href="San%20Mart%C3%ADn%20Jilotepeque">San Martín Jilotepeque</a> sources in the Guatemalan highlands. Lesser quantities of obsidian originated from other sources such as <a href="Tajumulco">Tajumulco</a>, <a href="Ixtepeque">Ixtepeque</a> and <a href="Pachuca">Pachuca</a>. Obsidian is a natural volcanic glass that was used across Mesoamerica to make durable tools and weapons including knives, spearheads, arrowheads, <a href="bloodletting%20in%20Mesoamerica">bloodletters</a> for ritual <a href="sacrifice%20in%20Maya%20culture">autosacrifice</a>, <a href="prismatic%20blade">prismatic blade</a>s for woodwork and many other day-to-day tools. The use of obsidian by the Maya has been likened to steel use in the modern world and it was widely traded throughout the Maya region and beyond. The proportion of obsidian from different sources varied over time:

The site had a long and continuous settlement history, with the period of principal occupation stretching from the Middle Preclassic down to the Postclassic. The earliest known occupation at Takalik Abaj dates towards the end of the Early Preclassic, ca. 1000 BC. However, it was not until the Middle to Late Preclassic that its first real florescence began with a noted surge in architectural constructions. From this period onwards a continuity of culture and population settlement is in evidence, as represented by the persistence of a local ceramic style (called "Ocosito") that remained in use until the Late Classic. The Ocosito style was typically made with red paste and <a href="pumice">pumice</a> and extended westwards at least as far as <a href="Coatepeque%2C%20Quetzaltenango">Coatepeque</a>, southwards to the <a href="Ocosito%20River">Ocosito River</a> and eastwards to the <a href="Samal%C3%A1%20River">Samalá River</a>. By the Terminal Classic, pottery associated with a highland <a href="K%27iche%27%20people">K'iche'</a> ceramic style had begun to appear intermixed with Ocosito ceramic complex deposits. Ocosito ceramics were replaced entirely by the K'iche' ceramic tradition by the Early Postclassic period.

Takalik Abaj was first occupied at the end of the Early Preclassic period. The remains of an Early Preclassic residential area have been found to the west of the Central Group, on the bank of the El Chorro stream. These first houses were built with floors made from river cobbles and reed-thatched roofs supported on timber poles. <a href="Pollen%20analysis">Pollen analysis</a> has revealed that the first inhabitants entered the area when it was still thick forest, which they began to clear in order to cultivate <a href="maize">maize</a> and other plants. Over 150 pieces of obsidian have been recovered from this area, known as El Escondite, mostly originating from the San Martín Jilotepeque and El Chayal sources.

Takalik Abaj was reoccupied at the beginning of the Middle Preclassic. This was probably by <a href="Mixe%E2%80%93Zoque%20languages">Mixe–Zoquean</a> inhabitants, as evidenced by the plentiful Olmec-style sculpture at the site dating to this period. The construction of public architecture had probably begun by the Middle Preclassic; the earliest structures were made of clay, which was sometimes partially burned in order to harden it. Ceramics from this period belonged to the local Ocosito tradition. This ceramic tradition, although it was local, showed strong affinities with the ceramics of the coastal plain and foothills of the <a href="Escuintla%20%28department%29">Escuintla</a> region.

The Pink Structure ("Estructura Rosada" in Spanish) was built as a low platform during the first part of the Middle Preclassic, at a time when the city was producing Olmec-style sculpture and <a href="La%20Venta">La Venta</a> was flourishing on the Gulf coast of Mexico (c.800–700 BC). During the latter part of the Middle Preclassic (c.700–400 BC), the Pink Structure was buried under the first version of the enormous Structure 7. It was at this time that the use of Olmec ceremonial structures was discontinued and Olmec sculpture was destroyed, signalling an intermediate period prior to the beginning of the city's Early Maya phase. The transition between the two phases was a gradual one, without abrupt changes.

During the <a href="Mesoamerican%20chronology">Late Preclassic</a> (300 BC – AD 200) various sites in the Pacific coastal region developed into true cities; Takalik Abaj was one of these, with an area greater than . The cessation of <a href="Olmec%20influences%20on%20Mesoamerican%20cultures">Olmec influence</a> upon the Pacific coastal zone occurred at the beginning of the Late Preclassic. At this time Takalik Abaj emerged as an important centre with an apparently local style of art and architecture; the inhabitants began to make boulder sculptures and to erect <a href="Maya%20stelae">stelae</a> and associated altars. At this time, between 200 BC and 150 AD, Structure 7 reached its maximum dimensions. Monuments were erected with both political and religious significance, some of which bore Maya-style dates and depictions of rulers. These early Maya monuments are carved with what may be among the earliest Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions and use of the <a href="Mesoamerican%20Long%20Count%20calendar">Mesoamerican Long Count calendar</a>. The early dates on Stelae 2 and 5 allow this style of sculpture to be more securely fixed in time within the late 1st century to the early 2nd century AD. The so-called <a href="Potbelly%20sculpture">potbelly</a> style of sculpture also appeared at this time. The appearance of Maya sculpture and the cessation of Olmec-style sculpture may represent a Maya intrusion into the area previously occupied by Mixe–Zoquean inhabitants. One possibility holds that Maya elites entered the area in order to take control of the cacao trade. However, given the evident continuity in local ceramic styles from the Middle to Late Preclassic, the change in attributes from Olmec to Maya may have been more an ideological than a physical transition. If they "had" arrived from elsewhere, the finds of Maya stelae and a Maya royal tomb suggest that the Maya were in a dominant position, whether they arrived as traders or conquerors.

There is evidence of increasing contact with <a href="Kaminaljuyu">Kaminaljuyu</a>, which emerged as a principal centre at this time, linking the Pacific coastal trade routes with the <a href="Motagua%20River">Motagua River</a> route, as well as increased contact with other sites along the Pacific coast. Within this extended trade route, Takalik Abaj and Kaminaljuyu appear to have been the two principal foci. The early Maya style of sculpture spread throughout this network.

During the Late Preclassic structures were built using volcanic stone held together with clay, as in the Middle Preclassic. However, they evolved to include stepped structures with indented corners and stairways dressed with rounded pebbles. At the same time, old Olmec-style sculptures were moved from their original positions and placed in front of the new-style buildings, sometimes reusing sculpture fragments in the stone facing.

Although the Ocosito ceramic tradition continued in use, the Late Preclassic ceramics in Takalik Abaj were strongly related to the Miraflores Ceramic Sphere that included Escuintla, the <a href="Valley%20of%20Guatemala">Valley of Guatemala</a> and western <a href="El%20Salvador">El Salvador</a>. This ceramic tradition consists of fine red wares that are particularly associated with Kaminaljuyu and are found throughout the southeastern Guatemalan highlands and the adjacent Pacific slope.

In the Early Classic, from around the 2nd century AD, the stela style that developed at Takalik Abaj and was associated with the portrayal of historic figures was adopted across the Maya lowlands, particularly in the <a href="Pet%C3%A9n%20Basin">Petén Basin</a>. During this period some of the pre-existing monuments were deliberately destroyed.

In this period, the ceramics showed a change with the entry of the highland Solano style, This ceramic tradition is most associated with the Solano site in the southeastern Valley of Guatemala and the most characteristic type is a brick-red ware covered with a bright orange <a href="mica">mica</a>ceous <a href="slip%20%28ceramics%29">slip</a>, sometimes painted with pink or purple decoration. This style of ceramics has been associated with the highland K'iche' Maya. These new ceramics did not replace the pre-existing Ocosito complex but rather became mingled with them.

Archaeological investigations have shown that the destruction of monuments and interruption of new construction at the site occurred simultaneously with the arrival of so-called Naranjo style ceramics, which appear to be linked to styles from the great metropolis of <a href="Teotihuacan">Teotihuacan</a> in the distant <a href="Valley%20of%20Mexico">Valley of Mexico</a>. The Naranjo ceramic tradition is particularly characteristic of the western Pacific coast of Guatemala between the <a href="Suchiate%20River">Suchiate</a> and <a href="Nahualate%20River">Nahualate</a> rivers. The most common forms are pitchers and bowls with a surface that has been smoothed with a cloth, leaving parallel marks, and usually coated with a white or yellow <a href="wash%20%28visual%20arts%29">wash</a>. At the same time, the use of local Ocosito ceramics waned. This Teotihuacan influence places the destruction of monuments in the second half of the Early Classic. The presence of the conquerors linked to the Naranjo-style ceramics was not of long duration and suggests that the conquerors exerted long-distance control of the site, replacing the local rulers with their own governors while leaving the local population intact.

The conquest of Takalik Abaj broke the ancient trade routes running along the Pacific coast from Mexico to El Salvador, these were replaced by a new route running up the <a href="Sierra%20Madre%20de%20Chiapas">Sierra Madre</a> and into the northwestern Guatemalan highlands.

In the Late Classic the site appears to have recovered from its earlier defeat. Naranjo-style ceramics diminished greatly in quantity and there was a surge in new large-scale construction. Many monuments broken by the conquerors were re-erected at this time.

Although use of the local Ocosito-style ceramics continued, there was a marked intrusion of K'iche' ceramics from the highlands in the Postclassic period, concentrated particularly in the northern part of the site but extending to cover the whole. The indigenous accounts of the K'iche' themselves claim that they conquered this region of the Pacific coast, suggesting that the presence of their ceramics is associated with their conquest of Takalik Abaj.

The K'iche' conquest appears to have taken place around AD 1000, some four centuries earlier than had been supposed using calculations based on the indigenous accounts. After the initial arrival of the K'iche' activity continued at the site without pause, and the local styles were simply replaced by styles associated with the conquerors. This suggests that the original inhabitants abandoned the city they had occupied for almost two millennia.

The first published account appeared in 1888, written by Gustav Bruhl. The German ethnologist and naturalist <a href="Karl%20Sapper">Karl Sapper</a> described Stela 1 in 1894 after he saw it beside the road he was travelling. Max Vollmberg, a German artist, drew Stela 1 and noted some other monuments, which attracted the interest of Walter Lehmann.

In 1902 the eruption of the nearby <a href="Santa%20Mar%C3%ADa%20%28volcano%29">Santiaguito</a> volcano covered the site in a layer of <a href="volcanic%20ash">volcanic ash</a> that varies between thick.

Walter Lehmann began the study of the sculptures of Takalik Abaj in the 1920s. In January 1942 <a href="J.%20Eric%20S.%20Thompson">J. Eric S. Thompson</a> visited the site with Ralph L. Roys and William Webb on behalf of the <a href="Carnegie%20Institution">Carnegie Institution</a> while undertaking a study of the Pacific Coast, publishing his accounts in 1943. Further investigations were undertaken by Suzanna Miles, Lee Parsons and <a href="Edwin%20M.%20Shook">Edwin M. Shook</a>. Miles bestowed the name Abaj Takalik to the site, which appeared in her contributed chapter in volume 2 of the "Handbook of Middle American Indians" published 1965. Previously it had been known by various names, including San Isidro Piedra Parada and Santa Margarita, after the names of the plantations in which the site lies, and also by the name of <a href="Colomba">Colomba</a>, a village to the north in the department of <a href="Quetzaltenango%20department">Quetzaltenango</a>.

Excavations at the site in the 1970s were sponsored by the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>. They began in 1976 and were undertaken by John A. Graham, Robert F. Heizer and Edwin M. Shook. This first season uncovered 40 new monuments, including Stela 5, to add to the dozen or so already known. Excavations by the University of California at Berkeley continued until 1981 and uncovered even more monuments in that time. From 1987 excavations have been continued by the Guatemalan <a href="Instituto%20de%20Antropolog%C3%ADa%20e%20Historia">Instituto de Antropología e Historia</a> (IDAEH) under the direction of Miguel Orrego and Christa Schieber, and new monuments continue to be uncovered. The site has been declared a national park.

In 2002 Takalik Abaj was entered on the <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site%23Nominating%20process">UNESCO World Heritage Tentative Lists</a>, under the heading of "The Mayan-Olmecan Encounter".

The core of the site covers about and includes remains of some 70 monumental structures positioned around a dozen plazas. Takalik Abaj has 2 <a href="Mesoamerican%20ballcourts">ballcourts</a> and over 239 known stone monuments, including impressive stelae and altars. The granite used to make monuments in <a href="Olmec">Olmec</a> and early Maya styles is much different from the soft limestone used in the Petén cities. The site is also noted for its hydraulic systems, including a "<a href="temazcal">temazcal</a>" or sauna bath with a subterranean drainage, and Preclassic tombs found in excavations from the late 1990s onwards by Drs. Marion Popenoe de Hatch, Christa Schieber de Lavarreda and Miguel Orrego, from the <a href="Ministerio%20de%20Cultura%20y%20Deportes">Ministerio de Cultura y Deportes</a>.

The structures at Takalik Abaj are spread among four groups; the Central, North and West Groups are clustered together but the South Group is located about to the south. The site is naturally defensible, being bordered by steep ravines. The site is spread over a series of nine terraces, which vary in width from and have faces varying in height from . These terraces are not uniformly oriented, instead the direction of their retaining faces depends upon the lie of the local terrain. The three main terraces supporting the city are artificial, with over of <a href="fill%20%28archaeology%29">fill</a> being used in places.

When Takalik Abaj was at its greatest extent, major architecture in the city covered an area of approximately , although the area occupied by residential construction has not been determined.


The hydraulic system included stone canals, which were not used for irrigation but rather to channel runoff and maintain the structural integrity of the principal architecture. These channels were also used to carry water to the residential areas of the city, and it is possible that the channels also served a ritual purpose linked to the rain god. So far, the remains of 25 channels have been found at the site. The larger channels measure wide by high, secondary channels measure about half that.

There are two methods of construction used for the water channels. Clay channels date from the Middle Preclassic while stone-lined channels date from the Late Preclassic through to the Classic, with stone-lined channels from the Late Classic being the largest channels built at the site. It is presumed that the clay channels were not sufficiently effective, thus leading to the switch in construction materials and the implementation of stone-lined channels. In the Late Classic pieces of broken stone monuments were reused in the construction of the water channels.

Terrace 2 is in the Central Group. Structures on this terrace date as far back as the Middle Preclassic and include an early example of a <a href="Mesoamerican%20ballcourts">ballcourt</a>.

Terrace 3 is in the Central Group. The facade represented a major construction project and dates to the Late Preclassic. The southeastern portion of Terrace 3 is believed to have been the most sacred plaza in the city, based on its concentration of sculpture and especially upon the presence of Structure 7 on the east side of the plaza. This area of the ancient city has been called "Tanmi T'nam" ("Heart of the People" in <a href="Mam%20language">Mam Maya</a>) by the mayor of El Asintal. A north-south row of 5 monuments was erected at the base of Structure 8, on the southwest side of the plaza, and another row of 5 sculptures runs east-west parallel to the southern edge of the terrace, with an additional 2 sculptures slightly south of them.

Terrace 5 is on the eastern side of the site immediately to the north of the Central Group. It measures east to west and north to south. Terrace 5 is on the San Isidro Piedra Parada plantation and is currently used for the cultivation of coffee. The retaining face of the terrace was built of compacted clay during the Late Preclassic and represented an enormous inversion of labour. This terrace continued in use until the Postclassic.

Terrace 6 supports the 16 structures of the West Group. It measures from east to west and from north to south. The terrace shows various phases of construction, it overlies a substructure built from large worked blocks of <a href="basalt">basalt</a>, which dates to the Late Preclassic, later phases of construction date to the Late Classic and the terrace has traces of the Postclassic K'iche' occupation of the site. The terrace lies within the San Isidro Piedra Parada and Buenos Aires plantations and the land is currently dedicated to the cultivation of rubber and coffee. A modern road cuts the eastern corner of Terrace 6.

Terrace 7 is a natural terrace that supports a part of the North Group. It runs east–west and is long. It supports 15 structures dating from the Terminal Classic through to the Postclassic and associated with the K'iche' occupation of the site. This terrace lies between the Buenos Aires and San Elías plantations and the eastern part has been cut by a modern road.

Terrace 8 is another natural terrace in the North Group. It also runs east west and is long. A modern road has cut the eastern part of the terrace and the western side of Structure 46 upon its edge. The terrace supports only this structure and one other to the north (Structure 54). The terrace was probably a residential area with cultivated land associated with the North Group. This terrace is associated with the K'iche' occupation of the site from the Terminal Classic through to the Postclassic.

Terrace 9 is the largest terrace at Takalik Abaj and supports part of the North Group. It is approximately running east–west and from north to south. The retaining face of the terrace runs immediately to the north of the main North Group complex on the western half of Terrace 7 for , at the eastern extreme of this section it turns north above Terrace 8 for before changing to run another east, limiting Terrace 8 on its west and north sides. Terrace 9 supports only two major structures (Structures 66 and 67). A modern road cuts the eastern side of the Terrace 9, excavations where the road has cut the terrace have revealed the possible remains of a <a href="Mesoamerican%20ballcourt">ballcourt</a>.

The Ballcourt is located in the southwest of Terrace 2 and dates to the Middle Preclassic. It has a north–south alignment with the sides of the wide playing area formed by Structures Sub-2 and Sub-4. The ballcourt is just over long with a playing area of . The southern limit of the ballcourt is formed by Structure Sub-1, just over to the south of Structures Sub-2 and Sub-4, creating a southern end-zone that runs east–west and measures with a surface area of .

Structure 5 is a large pyramid on the west side of Terrace 3. It was largely built during the Middle Preclassic. It forms the western end of an alignment of three structures, the others being Structures 6 and 7.

Structure 6 is a stepped rectangular platform forming the middle of the alignment on Terrace 3. It was first built in the Middle Preclassic but reached is greatest extent during the Late Preclassic and the beginning of the Early Classic. It is one of the most important ceremonial structures in the Central Group.

Structure 7 is a large platform located to the east of the plaza on Terrace 3 in the Central Group and is considered to have been one of the most sacred buildings at Takalik Abaj due to a series of important finds associated with it. Structure 7 measures and dates to the Middle Preclassic, although it did not attain its final form until the latter part of the Late Preclassic. Built upon the northern part of Structure 7 are two smaller structures, designated as Structures 7A and 7B. In the Late Classic, Structures 7, 7A and 7B were all refaced with stone. Structure 7 supports three rows of monuments aligned north–south that may have served as an astronomical observatory. One of these rows was aligned with the constellation <a href="Ursa%20Major">Ursa Major</a> in the Middle Preclassic, another aligned with <a href="Draco%20%28constellation%29">Draco</a> in the Late Preclassic, while the middle row was aligned with Structure 7A. Another important find in Structure 7 was a Late Classic cylindrical incensario given the name "La Niña" by archaeologists due to its prominent female <a href="appliqu%C3%A9">appliqué</a> figure. It dates to the earliest levels of K'iche' occupation of the site and is high and wide at the base. It was found together with a large quantity of other offerings including further ceramics and fragments of broken sculptures.

The Pink Structure ("Estructura Rosada") was a small ceremonial platform built upon the central axis of Structure 7 before the latter was erected over it. It is believed that this substructure was in use at the same time as Olmec sculpture was being produced both at Takalik Abaj and at <a href="La%20Venta">La Venta</a> in the <a href="Olmec%20heartland">Olmec heartland</a> of <a href="Veracruz">Veracruz</a> in Mexico.

Structure 7A is a small structure sitting on top of the northern part of Structure 7. It dates to the Middle Preclassic and has been excavated. The Late Preclassic royal tomb known as Burial 1 was found in its centre. A large offering of hundreds of ceramic vessels was found in the base of the structure and is associated with the burial. Structure 7A underwent substantial rebuilding in the Early Classic and was again modified in the Late Classic. Structure 7A measures and stands almost high. Its four sides were dressed with standing stones surrounded by a pavement.

Structure 7B is a small structure situated on the eastern side of Structure 7. Like Structure 7A, the four sides were dressed with standing stones and were surrounded by a pavement.

Structure 8 is located to the southwest of the plaza on Terrace 3, immediately to the west of the access stairway. Five sculpted monuments were erected in a row at the base of the east side of the building; the four that have been excavated are Monument 30, Stela 34, Stela 35 and Altar 18.

Structure 11 has been excavated. It was covered with rounded boulders held together with clay. It is located to the west of the plaza in the southern area of the Central Group.
Structure 12 lies to the east of Structure 11. It has also been excavated and, like Structure 11, it is covered with rounded boulders held together with clay. It lies to the east of the plaza in the southern area of the Central Group. The structure is a three-tiered platform with stairways on the east and west sides. The visible remains date to the Early Classic but they overlie Late Preclassic construction. A row of sculptures lines the west side of the structure, including six monuments, a stela and an altar. Further monuments line the east side, one of which may be the head of a <a href="crocodilia">crocodilia</a>n, the others are plain. Sculpture 69 is located on the south side of the structure.

Structure 17 is located in the South Group, on the Santa Margarita plantation. It contained a Late Preclassic cache of 13 prismatic obsidian blades.

Structure 32 is located near the western edge of the West Group.

Structure 34 is in the West Group, at the eastern corner of Terrace 6.

Structures 38, 39, 42 and 43 are joined by low platforms on the east side of a plaza on Terrace 7, aligned north–south. Structures 40, 47 and 48 are on south, west and north sides of this plaza. Structures 49, 50, 51, 52 and 53 form a small group on the west side of the terrace, bordered on the north by Terrace 9. Structure 42 is the tallest structure in the North Group, measuring about high. All of these structures are mounds.

Structure 46 is a mound at the edge of Terrace 8 in the North Group and dates from the Terminal Classic through to the Postclassic. The west side of the structure has been cut by a modern road.

Structure 54 is built upon Terrace 8, to the north of Structure 46, in the North Group. It is surrounded by an open area without mounds that was probably a mixed residential and agricultural area. It dates from the Terminal Classic through to the Postclassic.

Structure 57 is a large mound at the southern limit of the Central Group with an excellent view across the coastal plain. The structure was built in the Late Preclassic and underwent a second phase of construction in the Late Classic. It may have served as a look-out point.
Structure 61, Mound 61A and Mound 61B are all on the east side of Terrace 5, on the San Isidro plantation. Structure 61 was built during the Early Classic and is dressed with stone, it was built upon an earlier construction dating to the Late Preclassic. Stela 68 was found at the base of Mound 61A near to a broken altar. Structure 61 and its associated mounds may have been used to control access to the city during the height of its power, Mound 61A was reused during the Postclassic occupation of the site. Early Classic finds from Mound 61A include four ceramic vessels and four obsidian prismatic blades.

Structure 66 is located on Terrace 9, at the northern extreme of the North Group. It had an excellent view across the entire city and may have served as a sentry post controlling access to the site. It dates from the Terminal Classic through to the Postclassic.

Structure 67 is a large platform on Terrace 9 that may have been associated with a possible residential area upon that terrace and located to the north of the North Group.

Structure 68 is in the West Group. A part of the western side of the structure has been cut by a modern road. This has revealed a sequence of superimposed clay substructures dating to the Late Preclassic, the structure was then dressed with stone in the Early Classic.

Structure 86 is to the west of Structure 32, at the western edge of the West Group. The first phase of construction dates to the Early Classic, between 150 and 300 AD, when it took the form of a sunken patio, with stairways descending in the middle of its perimeter walls. At the centre of the patio were placed a clay altar and a stone, around which and across the rest of the patio were deposited an enormous number of offerings consisting of ceramic vessels, mostly from the Solano tradition.

North Ballcourt. The possible remains of a second ballcourt were found to the north of the North Group and may have been associated with the occupation of that group from the Terminal Classic through to the Postclassic. It was built from compacted clay and runs east–west, the North Structure was tall and the South Structure had a height of , the playing area was wide.

As of 2006, 304 stone monuments have been found at Takalik Abaj, mostly carved from local <a href="andesite">andesite</a> boulders. Of these monuments 124 are carved with the remainder being plain; they are mostly found in the Central and Western Groups. The worked monuments can be divided into four broad classifications: Olmec-style sculptures, which represent 21% of the total, Maya-style sculptures representing 42% of the monuments, potbelly monuments (14% of the total) and the local style of sculpture represented by zoomorphs (23% of the total).

Most of the monuments at Takalik Abaj are not in their original positions but rather have been moved and reset at a later date, therefore the dating of monuments at the site often depends upon stylistic comparisons. An example is a series of four monuments found in a plaza in front of a Classic period platform, with at least two of the four (Altar 12 and Monument 23) dating to the Preclassic.

There are several <a href="Maya%20stelae">stelae</a> sculpted in the early Maya style that bear hieroglyphic texts with <a href="Mesoamerican%20Long%20Count%20calendar">Long Count</a> dates that place them in the Late Preclassic. This style of sculpture is ancestral to the Classic style of the Maya lowlands.

Takalik Abaj has various so-called Potbelly monuments representing obese human figures sculpted from large boulders, of a type found throughout the Pacific lowlands, extending from Izapa in Mexico to <a href="El%20Salvador">El Salvador</a>. Their precise function is unknown but they appear to date from the Late Preclassic.

The many Olmec-style sculptures, including Monument 23, a colossal head that was recarved into a niche figure, seem to indicate a physical Olmec presence and control, possibly under an Olmec governor. Archaeologist John Graham states that:

Others are less sure: the Olmec-style sculptures may simply imply a common iconography of power on the Pacific and Gulf coasts. In any case, Takalik Abaj was certainly a place of importance for Olmecs. The Olmec-style sculptures at Takalik Abaj all date to the Middle Preclassic. Except for Monuments 1 and 64, the majority were not found in their original locations.

There are more than 30 monuments in the early Maya style, which dates to the Late Preclassic, making it the most common style represented at Takalik Abaj. The great quantity of early Maya sculpture and the presence of early examples of Maya hieroglyphic writing suggest that the site played an important part in the development of Maya ideology. The origins of the Maya sculptural style may have developed in the Preclassic on the Pacific coast and Takalik Abaj's position at the nexus of key trade routes could have been important in the dissemination of the style across the Maya area. The early Maya style of monument at Takalik Abaj is closely linked to the style of monument at Kaminaljuyu, showing mutual influence. This interlinked style spread to other sites that formed part of the extended trade network of which these two cities were the twin foci.

Sculptures of the Potbelly style are found all along the Pacific Coast from southern Mexico to El Salvador, as well as further afield at sites in the Maya lowlands. Although some investigators have suggested that this style is pre-Olmec, archaeological excavations on the Pacific Coast, including those at Takalik Abaj, have shown that this style began to be used at the end of the Middle Preclassic and reached its height during the Late Preclassic. The potbelly sculptures at Takalik Abaj all date to the Late Preclassic and are very similar to those at <a href="Monte%20Alto%20culture">Monte Alto</a> in Escuintla and Kaminaljuyu in the Valley of Guatemala.
Potbelly sculptures are generally rough sculptures that show considerable variation in size and the position of the limbs. They depict obese human figures, usually sat cross-legged with their arms upon their stomach. They have puffed out or hanging cheeks, closed eyes and are of indeterminate gender.

Local style sculptures are generally boulders carved into zoomorphic shapes, including three-dimensional representations of frogs, toads and crocodilians.

The "Cargador del Ancestro" ("Ancestor Carrier") consists of four fragments of sculpture that had been reused in the facades of four different buildings during the latter part of the Late Preclassic. Monuments 215 and 217 were discovered in 2008 during excavations of Structure 7A, while Stela Fragments 53 and 61 had been unearthed in previous excavations. Archaeologists discovered that although Monuments 215 and 217 possessed different themes and were executed in differing styles, they in fact fitted together perfectly to form part of a single sculpture that was still incomplete. This prompted a revision of previously found sculpture fragments and resulted in the discovery of two further pieces, originally found in Structures 12 and 74.

The four pieces were found to make up a single monumental high column with an unusual combination of sculptural characteristics. The extreme upper and lower portions are damaged and incomplete and the sculpture comprises three sections. The lowest section is a rectangular column with an early hieroglyphic text on both faces and a richly dressed Early Maya figure on the front. The figure is wearing a headdress in the form of a crocodile or crocodile-feline hybrid with the jaws agape and the face of an ancestor emerging. The lower portion of this section is damaged and a part of both the text and the figure is missing.

The middle section of the column, forming a type of <a href="Capital%20%28architecture%29">capital</a>, is a high-relief sculpture of the head of a bat executed in the curved lines of the Maya style, with small eyes and eyebrows formed by two small <a href="volute">volute</a>s. The leaf-shaped nose is characteristic of the <a href="Common%20Vampire%20Bat">Common Vampire Bat</a> ("Desmodus rotundus"). The mouth is open, exposing the partly preserved fangs, and a prominent tongue extends downwards. A band of double triangles runs around the sculpture with a carved cord or rope and may symbolise the bat's wings.

The upper section of the column is the sculpted figure of a squat, bare-footed individual standing upon the bat's head. The figure wears a loincloth bound by a belt and decorated with a large U symbol. An elaborately carved chest ornament with interlace pattern descends from the neck across the waste. The style is somewhat rigid and is reminiscent of formal olmec sculpture, and various costume elements resemble those found on Olmec sculptures from the Gulf Coast of Mexico. The figure has oval eyes and large earspools, the nose and mouth of the figure are damaged. It wears two bands that cross on the back and are joined to the belt and the shoulders, they support a small human figure facing backwards. The position and characteristics of this smaller figure are very similar to those of Olmec sculptures of infants, although the face is elderly. This secondary figure is wearing a type of long skirt or train that is almost identical to one worn by an Olmec-style dancing jaguar figure found at <a href="Tuxtla%20Chico">Tuxtla Chico</a> in <a href="Chiapas">Chiapas</a>, Mexico. This train extends down into the middle section of the column, continuing halfway down the back of the bat's head. The position of the shoulders and the face of the principal figure are not anatomically correct, leading the archaeologists to conclude that the "face" is actually a chest ornament and that the actual head of the main figure is missing. Although the upper section of the column contains many Olmec elements, it also lacks some distinctive features that are found in true Olmec art, such as the feline expression that is often depicted.

The sculpture predates 300 BC, based on the style of the hieroglyphic text, and is thought to be an Early Maya monument that was intended to represent an Early Maya ruler (at the base) who carried the underworld (i.e. the bat) and his ancestors (the main figure above carrying a smaller figure on its back). The Maya sculptor used half-remembered Olmec stylistic elements upon the ancestor figure in a form of Maya-Olmec <a href="syncretism">syncretism</a>, producing a hybrid sculpture. As such it represents the transition from one cultural phase to the next, at a point where the earlier Olmec inhabitants had not yet been forgotten and were viewed as powerful ancestors.

Altar 1 is found at the base of Stela 1. It is rectangular in shape with carved <a href="Molding%20%28decorative%29">molding</a> on its side.

Altar 2 is of unknown provenance, having been moved to outside the administrator's house on the San Isidro Piedra Parada plantation. It is long, about wide and about high. It represents an animal variously identified as a toad and a jaguar. The body of the animal was sculptured to form a hollow across and deep. The sculpture was broken into three pieces.

Altar 3 is a roughly worked flat, circular altar about across and high. It was probably associated originally with a stela but its original location is unknown, it was moved near to the manager's house on the San Isidro Piedra Parada plantation.

Altar 5 is a damaged plain circular altar associated with Stela 2.

Altar 7 is near the southern edge of the plaza on Terrace 3, where it is one of five monuments in a line running east-west.

Altar 8 is a plain monument associated with Stela 5, positioned on the west side of Structure 12.

Altar 9 is a low four-legged throne placed in front of Structure 11.

Altar 10 was associated with Stela 13 and was found on top of the large offering of ceramics associated with that stela and the royal tomb in Structure 7A. The monument was originally a throne with cylindrical supports that was reused as an altar in the Classic period.

Altar 12 is carved in the early Maya style and archaeologists consider it to be an especially early example dating to the first part of the Late Preclassic. Because of the carvings on the upper face of the altar, it is supposed that the monument was originally erected as a vertical stela in the Late Preclassic, and was reused as a horizontal altar in the Classic. At this time 16 hieroglyphs were carved around the outer rim of the altar. The carving on the upper face of the altar represents a standing human figure portrayed in profile, facing left. The figure is flanked by two vertical series of four glyphs. A smaller profile figure is depicted facing the first figure, separated from it by one of the series of glyphs. The central figure is depicted standing upon a horizontal band representing the earth, the band is flanked by two earth monsters. Above the figure is a celestial band with part of the head of a sacred bird visible in the centre. The 16 glyphs on the rim of the monument are formed by anthropomorphic figures mixed with other elements.
Altar 13 is another early Maya monument dating to the Late Preclassic. Like Altar 12 it was probably originally erected as a vertical stela. At some point it was deliberately broken, with severe damage inflicted upon the main portion of the sculpture, obliterating the central and lower portions. At a later date it was reused as a horizontal altar. The remains of two figures can be seen flanking the damage lower portion of the monument and the large head of the sacred bird survives above the area of damage. The right hand figure is wearing an interwoven skirt and is probably female.

Altar 18 was one of five monuments forming a north-south row at the base of Structure 8 on Terrace 3.

Altar 28 is located near Structure 10 in the Central Group. It is a circular basalt altar just over in diameter and thick. On the front rim of the altar is a carving of a skull. On the upper surface are two relief carvings of human feet.

Altar 30 is embedded in the fourth step of the access stairway to Terrace 3 in the Central Group. It has four low legs supporting it and is similar to Altar 9.

Altar 48 is a very early example of the Early Maya style of sculpture, dating to the first part of the Late Preclassic, between 400 and 200 BC. Altar 48 is fashioned from andesite and measures and is thick. It is located near the southern extreme of Terrace 3, where it is one of a row of 5 monuments running east-west. It is carved on its upper face and upon all four sides. The upper surface bears the intricate design of a crocodile with its body in the form of a symbol representing a cave and containing the figure of a seated Maya wearing a loincloth. The sides of the monument are carved with an early form of Maya hieroglyphs, the text appears to refer directly to the person depicted on the upper surface. Altar 48 had been carefully covered by Stela 14. The emergence of a Maya ruler from the body of the crocodile parallels the myth of the birth of the <a href="Maya%20maize%20god">Maya maize god</a>, who emerges from the shell of a turtle. As such, Altar 48 may be one of the earliest depictions of Maya mythology used for political ends.

Monument 1 is a volcanic boulder with the <a href="Relief">bas-relief</a> sculpture of a <a href="Mesoamerican%20ballgame">ballplayer</a>, probably representing a local ruler. This figure is facing to the right, kneeling on one knee with both hands raised. The sculpture was found near the riverbank at a crossing point of the river Ixchayá, some to the west of the Central Group. It measures about in height. Monument 1 dates to the Middle Preclassic and is distinctively Olmec in style.

Monument 2 is a potbelly sculpture found from the road running between the San Isidro and Buenos Aires plantations. It is about high and in diameter. The head is badly eroded and inclined slightly forwards, its arms are slightly bent with the hands doubled downwards and the fingers marked. Monument 2 dates to the Late Preclassic.

Monument 3 also dates to the Late Preclassic. It was relocated in modern times to the coffee-drying area of the Santa Margarita plantation. It is not known where it was originally found. It is a potbelly figure with a large head; it wears a necklace or pendant that hangs to its chest. It is about high and wide at the shoulders. The monument is damaged and missing the lower part.

Monument 4 appears to be a sculpture of a captive, leaning slightly forward and with the hands tied behind its back. It was found on the lands of the San Isidro plantation but it is not known exactly where. It was moved to the <a href="Museo%20Nacional%20de%20Arqueolog%C3%ADa%20y%20Etnolog%C3%ADa">Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología</a> in Guatemala City. This monument probably dates to the Late Preclassic. It is high and about wide.

Monument 5 was moved to the administrator's house of the San Isidro Piedra Parada plantation; the place where it was originally found is unknown. It measures in height and is wide at the widest point. It is a sculpture of a captive with the arms bound with a strip of cloth that falls across the hips.
Monument 6 is a zoomorph sculpture discovered during the construction of the road that passes the site. It was moved to the Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología in Guatemala City. The sculpture is just over in height and is wide. It is a boulder carved into the form of an animal head, probably that of a toad, and is likely to date to the Late Preclassic.

Monument 7 is a damaged sculpture in the form of a giant head. It stands and was found in the first half of the 20th century on the site of the electricity generator of the Santa Margarita plantation and moved close to the administration office. The sculpture has a large, flat face with prominent eyebrows. Its style is very similar to that of a monument found at <a href="Kaminaljuyu">Kaminaljuyu</a> in the highlands.

Monument 8 is found on the west side of Structure 12. It is a zoomorphic sculpture of a monster with feline characteristics disgorging a small anthropomorphic figure from its mouth.

Monument 9 is a local style sculpture representing an owl.

Monument 10 is another monument that was moved from its original location; it was moved to the estate of the Santa Margarita plantation and the place where it was originally found is unknown. It is about high and wide. This is a damaged sculpture representing a kneeling captive with the arms tied.
Monument 11 is located in the southwestern area of Terrace 3, to the east of Structure 8. It is a natural boulder carved with a vertical series of five hieroglyphs. Further left is a single hieroglyph and the glyphs for the number 11. This sculpture is considered to be in an especially early Maya style and dates to the first part of the Late Preclassic. It is one of a row of 5 monuments running east-west along the southern edge of Terrace 3.

Monument 14 is an eroded Olmec-style sculpture dating to the Middle Preclassic. It represents a squatting human figure, possibly female, wearing a headdress and <a href="earspool">earspool</a>s. Under one arm it grips a <a href="Jaguars%20in%20Mesoamerican%20cultures">jaguar</a> cub, under the other it carries a fawn.

Monument 15 is a large boulder with an Olmec-style relief sculpture of the head, shoulders and arms of an anthropomorphic figure emerging from a shallow niche, the arms bent inwards at the elbow. The back of the boulder is carved with the hindquarters of a feline, probably a jaguar.

Monument 16 and Monument 17 are two parts of the same broken sculpture. This sculpture is classically Olmec in style and is heavily eroded but represents a human head wearing a headdress in the form of a secondary face wearing a helmet.

Monument 23 dates to the <a href="Mesoamerican%20chronology%23Preclassic%20Era">Middle Preclassic</a> period. It appears that it was an Olmec-style colossal head that was recarved into a niche figure sculpture. If this was originally a colossal head then it would be the only example known from outside the Olmec heartland. Monument 23 is sculpted from <a href="andesite">andesite</a> and falls in the middle of the size range for confirmed Olmec colossal heads. It stands high and measures wide by deep. Like the examples from the Olmec heartland, the monument features a flat back. Lee Parsons contested John Graham's identification of Monument 23 as a recarved colossal head; he viewed the side ornaments that Graham identified as ears as instead being the scrolled eyes of an open-jawed monster gazing upwards. Countering this, James Porter has claimed that the recarving of the face of a colossal head into a niche figure is clearly evident. Monument 23 was damaged in the mid-20th century by a local mason who attempted to break its exposed upper portion using a steel chisel. As a result, the top is fragmented, although the broken pieces were recovered by archaeologists and have been put back into place.

Monument 25 is a heavily eroded relief sculpture of a figure seated in a niche.

Monument 27 is located near the southern edge of Terrace 3, just south of a row of 5 sculptures running east-west.

Monument 28 is situated near Monument 27 at the southern edge of Terrace 3.

Monument 30 is located on Terrace 3, in a row of 5 monuments at the base Structure 8.

Monument 35 is a plain monument on Terrace 6, it dates to the Late Preclassic.

Monument 40 is a potbelly monument dating to the Late Preclassic.

Monument 44 is a sculpture of a captive.

Monument 47 is a local style monument representing a frog or toad.

Monument 55 is an Olmec-style sculpture of a human head. It was moved to the Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología (National Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology).

Monument 64 is an Olmec-style bas-relief carved onto the south side of a natural andesite rock and stylistically dates to the Middle Preclassic, although it was found in a Late Preclassic archaeological context. It was found "in-situ" on the eastern bank of the El Chorro stream, some to the west of the South-Central Group. It represents an anthropomorphic figure with some feline characteristics. The figure is portrayed in profile and is wearing a belt. It holds a zigzag staff in its extended left hand.

Monument 65 is a badly damaged depiction of a human head in Olmec style, dating to the Middle Preclassic. Its eyes are closed and the mouth and nose are completely destroyed. It is wearing a helmet. It is located to the west of Structure 12.
Monument 66 is a local style sculpture of a crocodilian head that may date to the Middle Preclassic. It is located to the west of Structure 12.

Monument 67 is a badly eroded Olmec-style sculpture showing a figure emerging from the mouth of a jaguar, with one hand raised and gripping a staff. Traces of a helmet are visible. It is located to the west of Structure 12 and dates to the Middle Preclassic.

Monument 68 is a local style sculpture of a toad located on the west side of Structure 12. It is believed to date to the Middle Preclassic.

Monument 69 is a potbelly monument dating to the Late Preclassic.

Monument 70 is a local style sculpture of a frog or toad.

Monument 93 is a rough Olmec-style sculpture dating from the Middle Preclassic. It represents a seated anthropomorphic jaguar with a human head.

Monument 99 is a colossal head in potbelly style, dating to the Late Preclassic.

Monument 100, Monument 107 and Monument 109 are small potbelly monuments dating to the Late Preclassic. They are all near the access stairway to Terrace 3 in the Central Group.
Monument 108 is an altar placed in front of the main stairway giving access to Terrace 3, in the Central Group.

Monument 113 is located outside of the site core, some south of the Central Group, about west of El Asintal, in a secondary site known as the South Group, which consists of six structure mounds. It is carved from an andesite boulder and bears a relief carving of a jaguar lying on its left side. Its eyes and mouth are open and various jaguar pawprints are carved upon the body of the animal.

Monument 126 is a large <a href="basalt">basalt</a> rock bearing bas-relief carvings of life-size human hands. It is found upon the bank of a small stream near the Central Group.

Monument 140 is a Late Preclassic sculpture of a toad, it is located in the West Group, on Terrace 6.

Monument 141 is a rectangular altar dating to the Late Preclassic. It is located in the West Group on Terrace 6.

Monuments 142, 143, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149 and 156 are among 19 natural stone monuments that line the course of the Nima stream, some west of the West Group, within the Buenos Aires and San Isidro plantations. They are basalt and andesite boulders that have deep circular depressions with polished sides that are perhaps the result of some kind of working activity.

Monument 154 is a large basalt rock, it bears two petroglyphs representing childlike faces. It is located on the west side of the Nima stream, on the Buenos Aires plantation.

Monument 157 is a large andesite rock on the west side of the Nima stream, on the San Isidro plantation. It bears the petroglyph of a face with eyes and eyebrows, nose and mouth.

Monument 161 lies within the North Group, on the San Elías plantation. It is a basalt outcrop measuring high by wide on the side of the Ixchayá ravine. It bears a petroglyph of a face carved onto the upper part of the rock, looking upwards. The face has cheekbones, a prominent chin and a slightly open mouth. It has some stylistic similarity to Early Classic jade masks, although it lacks certain features associated with these.

Monument 163 dates from the Late Preclassic. It was found reused in the construction of a Late Classic water channel beside Structure 7. It represents a seated figure with prominent male genitals and is badly damaged, with the head and shoulders missing.

Monument 215 is a part of the Cargador del Ancestro sculpture. It was found embedded in the east face of Structure 7A, where it was carefully placed at the same time as the royal burial was interred in the centre of the structure.

Monument 217 is another part of the Cargador del Ancestro sculpture. It was embedded in the east face of Structure 7A in the same manner, and at the same time, as Monument 215.

<a href="Stele">Stelae</a> are carved stone shafts, often sculpted with figures and hieroglyphs. A selection of the most notable stelae at Takalik Abaj follows:

Stela 1 was found near to Stela 2 and moved near to the administrator's house of the San Isidro Piedra Parada plantation. It is high, wide and thick. It bears the sculpture of a standing figure facing to the left, holding a sceptre in the form of a serpent with a dragon mask at the lower end; a feline is on top of the serpent's body. It is similar in style to Stela 1 at <a href="El%20Ba%C3%BAl">El Baúl</a>. A badly eroded hieroglyphic text is to the left of the figure's face, which is now completely illegible. This stela is early Maya in style, dating to the Late Preclassic.

Stela 2 is a monument in the early Maya style that is inscribed with a damaged Long Count date. Due to its only partial preservation, this date has at least three possible readings, the latest of which would place it in the 1st century BC. Flanking the text are two standing figures facing each other, the sculpture probably represents one ruler receiving power from his predecessor. Above the figures and the text is an ornate figure depicted in profile looking down at the left-hand figure below. Stela 2 is located in front of the retaining wall of Terrace 5.

Stela 3 is badly damaged, being broken into three pieces. It was found somewhere on the San Isidro Piedra Parada plantation although its exact original location is not known. It was moved to a museum in Guatemala City. The lower portion of the stela depicts two legs facing to the left standing upon a horizontal band divided into three sections, each section containing a symbol or glyph.

Stela 4 was uncovered in 1969 and moved near to the administrator's house on the San Isidro Piedra Parada plantation. It is of a style very similar to the stelae at Izapa and stands high. The stela bears a complex design representing an undulating <a href="vision%20serpent">vision serpent</a> rising toward the sky from the water flowing from two earth monsters, the jaws of the serpent are open wide towards the sky and from them emerges a characteristically Maya face. Several glyphs appear among the imagery. This stela is early Maya in style and dates to the Late Preclassic.
Stela 5 is reasonably well preserved and is inscribed with two Long Count dates flanked by representations of two standing figures portraying rulers. The latest of these two dates is AD 126. The right-hand figure is holding a snake, while the left-hand figure is holding what is probably a jaguar. This monument probably represents one ruler passing power to the next. A small seated figure is carved onto each of the sides of this stela along with a badly eroded hieroglyphic inscription. The style is early Maya and has affinities with sculptures at <a href="Izapa">Izapa</a>.

Stela 12 is located near Structure 11. It is badly damaged, having been broken into fragments, of which two remain. The largest fragment is from the lower portion of the stela and depicts the legs and feet of a figure, both facing in the same direction. They stand upon a panel divided into geometric sections, each containing a further design. In front of the legs are the remains of a glyph that appears to be a number in the <a href="Maya%20numerals">bar-and-dot</a> format. A smaller fragment lies nearby.

Stela 13 dates to the Late Preclassic. It is badly damaged, having been broken in two parts. It is carved in early Maya style and bears a design representing a stylised serpentine head, very similar to a monument found at Kaminaljuyu. Stela 13 was erected at the base of the south side of Structure 7A. At the base of the stela was found a massive offering of more than 600 ceramic vessels, 33 <a href="prismatic%20blade">prismatic obsidian blades</a>, as well as other artifacts. The stela and the offering are associated with the Late Preclassic royal tomb known as Burial 1.
Stela 14 is on the southern edge of Terrace 3, in the Central Group, where it is one of 5 monuments in an east-west row. It is fashioned from <a href="andesite">andesite</a> and has 26 cup-like depressions upon the upper surface. It is one of the few such monuments found within the ceremonial centre of the city. Altar 48 was found underneath Stela 14 in 2008, having been carefully covered by it in antiquity. Stela 14 measures by thick and weighs more than . The lower surface of the stela had been sculpted completely flat with 6 small cupmarks and a series of marks forming a design reminiscent of the discarded skin of a snake or of a <a href="vertebral%20column">vertebral column</a>.

Stela 15 is another monument on the southern edge of Terrace 3, one of a row of five.

Stela 29 is a smooth andesite monument at the southeast corner of Structure 11 with seven steps carved into its upper portion.

Stela 34 was found at the base of Structure 8, where it was one of a row of five monuments.

Stela 35 was another of the five monuments found at the base of Structure 8.

Stela 53 is a fragment of sculpture that was found in the latter Early Preclassic phase of Structure 12, directly behind Stela 5. Stela 53 forms a part of the Cargador del Ancestro sculpture. Stela 5 was placed at the same time that Stela 53 was embedded in Structure 12, and the long count date on the former also allows the placing of Stela 53 to be fixed in time at Late Preclassic–Early Classic transition.

Stela 61 is a part of the Cargador del Ancestro sculpture. In the Late Preclassic–Early Classic transition it had been embedded in the east access stairway to Terrace 3.

Stela 66 is a plain stela dating to the Late Preclassic. It is found in the West Group, on Terrace 6.

Stela 68 was found at the southeast corner of Mound 61A on Terrace 5. This stela was broken in two and the remaining fragments appear to belong to two separate monuments. The stela, or stelae, once bore early Maya sculpture but this appears to have been deliberately destroyed, leaving only a few sculptured symbols.

Stela 71 is an early Maya carved fragment reused in the construction of a water channel by Structure 7.

Stela 74 is a fragment of Olmec-style sculpture that was found in the Middle Preclassic fill of Structure 7, where it was placed when that structure replaced the Pink Structure. It bears a foliated maize design topped with a U-symbol within a <a href="cartouche%20%28design%29">cartouche</a> and has other, smaller, U-symbols at its base. It is very similar to a design found on Monument 25/26 from La Venta.

A Late Preclassic tomb has been excavated, believed to be a royal burial. This tomb has been designated Burial 1; it was found during excavations of Structure 7A and was inserted into the centre of this Middle Preclassic structure. The burial is also associated with Stela 13 and with a massive offering of more than 600 ceramic vessels and other artifacts found at the base of Structure 7A. These ceramics date the offering to the end of the Late Preclassic. No human remains have been recovered but the find is assumed to be a burial due to the associated artifacts. The body is believed to have been interred upon a litter measuring , which was probably made of wood and coated in red <a href="cinnabar">cinnabar</a> dust. Grave goods include an 18-piece <a href="Jade%20use%20in%20Mesoamerica">jade</a> necklace, two <a href="earspool">earspool</a>s coated in cinnabar, various mosaic <a href="Mirrors%20in%20Mesoamerican%20culture">mirrors</a> made from <a href="iron%20pyrite">iron pyrite</a>, one consisting of more than 800 pieces, a jade mosaic mask, two prismatic obsidian blades, a finely carved <a href="Greenstone%20%28archaeology%29">greenstone</a> fish, various beads that presumably formed jewellery such as bracelets and a selection of ceramics that date the tomb to AD 100–200.

In October 2012, a tomb carbon-dated between 700 BC and 400 BC was reported to have been found in Takalik Abaj of a ruler nicknamed <a href="K%27utz%20Chman">K'utz Chman</a> ("Grandfather Vulture" in Mam) by archaeologists, a <a href="sacred%20king">sacred king</a> or "big chief" who "bridged the gap between the Olmec and Mayan cultures in Central America," according to <a href="Miguel%20Orrego">Miguel Orrego</a>. The tomb is suggested to be the oldest Maya royal burial to have been discovered so far.

Redwood National and State Parks

The Redwood National and State Parks (RNSP) are a complex of several state and national parks located in the United States, along the coast of northern <a href="California">California</a>. Comprising Redwood National Park (established 1968) and California's <a href="Del%20Norte%20Coast%20Redwoods%20State%20Park">Del Norte Coast</a>, <a href="Jedediah%20Smith%20Redwoods%20State%20Park">Jedediah Smith</a>, and <a href="Prairie%20Creek%20Redwoods%20State%20Park">Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park</a>s (dating from the 1920s), the combined RNSP contain , and feature <a href="old-growth%20forest">old-growth</a> <a href="temperate%20rainforest">temperate rainforest</a>s. Located entirely within <a href="Del%20Norte%20County%2C%20California">Del Norte</a> and <a href="Humboldt%20County%2C%20California">Humboldt Counties</a>, the four parks, together, protect 45% of all remaining <a href="Sequoia%20sempervirens">coast redwood</a> ("Sequoia sempervirens") old-growth forests, totaling at least . These <a href="tree">tree</a>s are the tallest and one of the most massive tree species on Earth. In addition to the redwood forests, the parks preserve other indigenous <a href="flora">flora</a>, <a href="fauna">fauna</a>, grassland <a href="prairie">prairie</a>, cultural resources, portions of rivers and other streams, and of pristine coastline.

In 1850, <a href="Old-growth%20forest">old-growth</a> redwood forest covered more than of the California coast. The northern portion of that area, originally inhabited by <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a>, attracted many lumbermen and others turned gold miners when a minor <a href="gold%20rush">gold rush</a> brought them to the region. Failing in efforts to strike it rich in gold, these men turned toward harvesting the giant trees for booming development in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> and other places on the West Coast. After many decades of unrestricted <a href="Clearcutting">clear-cut logging</a>, serious efforts toward conservation began. By the 1920s the work of the <a href="Save%20the%20Redwoods%20League">Save the Redwoods League</a>, founded in 1918 to preserve remaining old-growth redwoods, resulted in the establishment of <a href="Prairie%20Creek%20Redwoods%20State%20Park">Prairie Creek</a>, <a href="Del%20Norte%20Coast%20Redwoods%20State%20Park">Del Norte Coast</a>, and <a href="Jedediah%20Smith%20Redwoods%20State%20Park">Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park</a>s among others. Redwood National Park was created in 1968, by which time nearly 90% of the original redwood trees had been logged. The <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> (NPS) and the <a href="California%20Department%20of%20Parks%20and%20Recreation">California Department of Parks and Recreation</a> (CDPR) administratively combined Redwood National Park with the three abutting Redwood State Parks in 1994 for the purpose of cooperative forest management and stabilization of forests and watersheds as a single unit.

The ecosystem of the RNSP preserves a number of <a href="threatened%20species">threatened</a> animal species such as the <a href="tidewater%20goby">tidewater goby</a>, <a href="Chinook%20salmon">Chinook salmon</a>, <a href="northern%20spotted%20owl">northern spotted owl</a>, and <a href="Steller%27s%20sea%20lion">Steller's sea lion</a>. In recognition of the rare ecosystem and cultural history found in the parks, the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> designated them a <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> on September 5, 1980 and part of the <a href="California%20Coast%20Ranges%20%28reserve%29">California Coast Ranges</a> <a href="International%20Biosphere%20Reserve">International Biosphere Reserve</a> on June 30, 1983.

Modern day native groups such as the <a href="Yurok%20people">Yurok</a>, <a href="Tolowa">Tolowa</a>, <a href="Karok">Karok</a>, <a href="Chilula">Chilula</a>, and <a href="Wiyot%20people">Wiyot</a> all have historical ties to the region, and some <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> groups still live in the park area today. Archaeological study shows they arrived in the area as far back as 3,000 years ago. An 1852 census determined that the Yurok were the most numerous, with 55 villages and an estimated population of 2,500. They used the abundant redwood, which with its linear <a href="Wood%20grain">grain</a> was easily split into planks, as a building material for boats, houses, and small villages. For buildings, the planks would be erected side by side in a narrow trench, with the upper portions bound with <a href="leather">leather</a> strapping and held by notches cut into the supporting roof beams. Redwood boards were used to form a shallow sloping roof.

Previous to <a href="Jedediah%20Smith">Jedediah Smith</a> in 1828, no other explorer of European descent is known to have thoroughly investigated the inland region away from the immediate coast. The discovery of gold along the <a href="Trinity%20River%20%28California%29">Trinity River</a> in 1850 led to a minor secondary rush in California. This brought miners into the area and many stayed on at the coast after failing to strike it rich. This quickly led to conflicts wherein native peoples were placed under great strain, if not forcibly removed or massacred. By 1895, only one third of the Yurok in one group of villages remained; by 1919, virtually all members of the Chilula tribe had either died or been assimilated into other tribes. The miners <a href="logging">logged</a> redwoods for building; when this minor <a href="gold%20rush">gold rush</a> ended, some of them turned again to logging, cutting down the giant redwood trees. Initially, over of the California and southwestern coast of Oregon were old-growth redwood forest, but by 1910, extensive logging led <a href="conservation%20movement">conservationist</a>s and concerned citizens to begin seeking ways to preserve the remaining trees, which they saw being logged at an alarming rate. In 1911, <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. Representative</a> <a href="John%20E.%20Raker">John E. Raker</a>, of California, became the first politician to introduce legislation for the creation of a redwood national park. However, no further action was taken by Congress at that time.
Preservation of the redwood stands in California is considered one of the most substantial conservation contributions of the <a href="Boone%20and%20Crockett%20Club">Boone and Crockett Club</a>. The Save the Redwoods League was founded in 1918 by Boone and Crockett Club members <a href="Madison%20Grant">Madison Grant</a>, <a href="John%20C.%20Merriam">John C. Merriam</a>, <a href="Henry%20Fairfield%20Osborn">Henry Fairfield Osborn</a>, and future member, <a href="Frederick%20Russell%20Burnham">Frederick Russell Burnham</a>. The initial purchases of land were made by club member <a href="Stephen%20Mather">Stephen Mather</a> and William Kent. In 1921, Boone and Crockett Club member <a href="John%20C.%20Phillips">John C. Phillips</a> donated $32,000 to purchase land and create the <a href="Raynal%20Bolling">Raynal Bolling</a> Memorial Grove in the <a href="Humboldt%20Redwoods%20State%20Park">Humboldt Redwoods State Park</a>. This was timely as <a href="U.S.%20Route%20101">U.S. Route 101</a>, which would soon provide nearly unfettered access to the trees, was under construction. Using matching funds provided initially by the County of Humboldt and later by the State of California, the Save the Redwoods League] managed to protect areas of concentrated or multiple redwood groves and a few entire forests in the 1920s. As California created a state park system, beginning in 1927, three of the preserved redwood areas became Prairie Creek Redwoods, Del Norte Coast Redwoods, and Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Parks. A fourth became <a href="Humboldt%20Redwoods%20State%20Park">Humboldt Redwoods State Park</a>, by far the largest of the individual Redwood State Parks, but not in the Redwood National and State Park system. Because of the high demand for lumber during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and the construction boom that followed in the 1950s, the creation of a national park was delayed. Efforts by the Save the Redwoods League, the <a href="Sierra%20Club">Sierra Club</a>, and the <a href="National%20Geographic%20Society">National Geographic Society</a> to create a national park began in the early 1960s. After intense lobbying of <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a>, the bill creating Redwood National Park was signed by <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Lyndon%20Johnson">Lyndon Johnson</a> on October 2, 1968. The Save the Redwoods League and other entities purchased over , which were added to existing state parks. Amidst both local support of environmentalists and opposition from local loggers and logging companies, were added to Redwood National Park in a major expansion in 1978. However, only a fifth of that land was old-growth forest, the rest having been logged. This expansion protected the watershed along <a href="Redwood%20Creek%20%28Humboldt%20County%29">Redwood Creek</a> from being adversely affected by logging operations outside the park. The federal and state parks were administratively combined in 1994.

The <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> designated Redwood National and State Parks a <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> on September 5, 1980. The evaluation committee noted 50 prehistoric <a href="Archaeology">archaeological</a> sites, spanning 4,500 years. It also cited ongoing research in the park by <a href="Humboldt%20State%20University">Humboldt State University</a> researchers, among others. The park is part of a much larger region designated the "California Coast Ranges" <a href="International%20Biosphere%20Reserve">International Biosphere Reserve</a> on June 30, 1983. The California Coast Ranges biosphere is overseen by the <a href="University%20of%20California%20Natural%20Reserve%20System">University of California Natural Reserve System</a>.

The park has served as a filming location for numerous films. Scenes set on the forest moon <a href="Endor%20%28Star%20Wars%29">Endor</a> in "" were filmed in the Tall Trees Redwood Grove in the northern part of <a href="Humboldt%20County%2C%20California">Humboldt County</a>, though the majority of filming was in private and public forests near the town of <a href="Smith%20River%2C%20California">Smith River, California</a>. Scenes for "" as well as the movie "<a href="Outbreak%20%28film%29">Outbreak</a>" were filmed at the nearby <a href="Prairie%20Creek%20Redwoods%20State%20Park">Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park</a> and at <a href="Patrick%27s%20Point%20State%20Park">Patrick's Point State Park</a>.

Redwood National Park headquarters is located in <a href="Crescent%20City%2C%20California">Crescent City, California</a>, with a service office located in <a href="Arcata">Arcata</a> and an operations center located in <a href="Orick%2C%20California">Orick, California</a>.

Lack of money has precluded major improvements, however, and timber companies have replanted much of the logged area with non-native tree species. Coastline areas, including dunes and coastal prairie, have been invaded by exotic species, partly due to the suppression of <a href="wildfire">forest fire</a>s until the 1980s. A fire management plan now allows <a href="controlled%20burn">controlled burn</a>ing as one method to return the parkland to its original state. Since the redwoods were logged on the basis of accessibility, with inaccessible areas being cut last, large old-growth forest sections were isolated from one another, sometimes by many miles. In these cases it will be decades more before mature forest can return, regardless of the amount of money used to rehabilitate the ecosystem.

The park has transformed a few logging roads into scenic public drives. These do not meet current safety standards, but funding to improve them is not available at present. Park structures such as visitor centers and employee housing also need updating to meet increasing demands. Park employees perform air and water quality surveys, monitor endangered and <a href="threatened%20species">threatened species</a>, and work closely with the <a href="California%20Coastal%20National%20Monument">California Coastal National Monument</a>, which is managed by the <a href="U.S.%20Bureau%20of%20Land%20Management">U.S. Bureau of Land Management</a>. In 2005, the parks were authorized to expand another to include the Mill Creek watershed.

The Redwood National and State Parks form one of the most significant protected areas of the <a href="Northern%20California%20coastal%20forests">Northern California coastal forests</a> ecoregion.

It is estimated that old-growth redwood forest once covered close to of coastal northern California. 96% of all old-growth redwoods have been logged, and almost half (45%) of the redwoods remaining are found in Redwood National and State Parks. The parks protect of <a href="old-growth%20forest">old-growth forest</a> almost equally divided between federal and state management. Redwoods have existed along the coast of northern California for at least 20 million years and are related to tree species that existed 160 million years ago.

The native range of <a href="coast%20redwood">coast redwood</a> is from the northern California coast north to the southern <a href="Oregon%20Coast">Oregon Coast</a>. The tree is closely related to the <a href="giant%20sequoia">giant sequoia</a> of central California, and more distantly to the <a href="Metasequoia">dawn redwood</a> which is indigenous to the <a href="Sichuan">Sichuan</a>–<a href="Hubei">Hubei</a> region of China. Coast redwoods are the tallest trees on Earth; as of September 2006, the tallest tree in the park was <a href="hyperion%20%28tree%29">Hyperion</a> at , followed by Helios and Icarus which were and respectively.
Before September 2006, the tallest living specimen known was the <a href="Stratosphere%20Giant">Stratosphere Giant</a>, outside the park in <a href="Humboldt%20Redwoods%20State%20Park">Humboldt Redwoods State Park</a>, which was in 2004. For many years, one specimen simply named Tall Tree in Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park and within the RNSP was measured at , but the top of the tree was reported to have died in the 1990s. One tree that fell in 1991 was reported to be . Only the giant sequoia has more mass. The largest redwood by volume is the 42,500 cubic foot (1,205 m³) <a href="Lost%20Monarch">Lost Monarch</a>, located in Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park. Mature Coast redwoods live an average of 500–700 years and a few are documented to be 2,000 years old, making them some of the longest-living organisms on earth. They are highly resistant to disease, due to a thick protective bark and high <a href="tannin">tannin</a> content. Redwoods prefer sheltered slopes, slightly inland and near water sources such as rivers and streams.

Redwood trees develop enormous limbs that accumulate deep organic soils and can support tree-sized trunks growing on them. This typically occurs above . Scientists have recently discovered that plants which normally grow on the forest floor also grow in these soils, well above ground. The soil mats provide homes to <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s, <a href="Mollusca">mollusks</a>, <a href="earthworm">earthworm</a>s, and <a href="salamander">salamander</a>s. During <a href="drought">drought</a> seasons, some treetops die back, but the trees do not die outright. Instead, redwoods have developed mechanisms to regrow new trunks from other limbs. These secondary trunks, called "reiterations", also develop root systems in the accumulated soils at their bases. This helps transport water to the highest reaches of the trees. Coastal fog also provides up to one-third of their annual water needs.

Another large tree commonly found in the forest is the <a href="coast%20Douglas-fir">coast Douglas-fir</a>, which has been measured at heights of over . <a href="Sitka%20spruce">Sitka spruce</a> are plentiful along the coast and are better adapted to salty air than other species. The <a href="evergreen">evergreen</a> <a href="hardwood">hardwood</a> <a href="tanoak">tanoak</a> produces a nut similar to the <a href="acorn">acorn</a>s produced by the related genus "Quercus" (<a href="oak">oak</a>). Both tanoaks and oaks are members of the <a href="Fagaceae">beech family</a>. Trees such as the <a href="Pacific%20madrone">Pacific madrone</a>, <a href="bigleaf%20maple">bigleaf maple</a>, <a href="Umbellularia">California laurel</a>, and <a href="Alnus%20rubra">red alder</a> are also widespread throughout the parks.

<a href="Huckleberry">Huckleberry</a>, <a href="blackberry">blackberry</a>, and <a href="salmonberry">salmonberry</a> are part of the forest <a href="understory">understory</a> and provide food for many animal species. The <a href="Rhododendron">California rhododendron</a> and <a href="azalea">azalea</a> are flowering shrubs common in the park, especially in old-growth forest. Plants such as the <a href="Polystichum%20munitum">sword fern</a> are prolific, particularly near ample water sources. In Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park, <a href="Fern%20Canyon">Fern Canyon</a> is a well-known ravine deep, with walls completely covered in ferns.

The ecosystems of RNSP preserve a number of rare animal species. Numerous ecosystems exist, with seacoast, river, prairie, and densely forested zones all within the park. The <a href="tidewater%20goby">tidewater goby</a> is a federally listed <a href="endangered%20species">endangered species</a> that live near the Pacific coastline. The <a href="bald%20eagle">bald eagle</a>, which usually nests near a water source, is listed as a state of California endangered species. The <a href="Chinook%20salmon">Chinook salmon</a>, <a href="northern%20spotted%20owl">northern spotted owl</a>, and <a href="Steller%27s%20sea%20lion">Steller's sea lion</a> are a few of the other animal species that are threatened.

Over 40 species of mammals have been documented, including the <a href="American%20black%20bear">black bear</a>, <a href="mountain%20coyote">coyote</a>, <a href="North%20American%20cougar">cougar</a>, <a href="bobcat">bobcat</a>, <a href="North%20American%20beaver">beaver</a>, <a href="North%20American%20river%20otter">river otter</a>, <a href="black-tailed%20deer">black-tailed deer</a>, and <a href="elk">elk</a>. Along the coastline, <a href="California%20sea%20lion">California sea lion</a>s, <a href="Steller%20sea%20lion">Steller sea lion</a>s and <a href="harbor%20seal">harbor seal</a>s live near the shore and on seastacks, rocky outcroppings forming small islands just off the coast. <a href="Dolphin">Dolphin</a>s and <a href="Gray%20whale">Pacific gray whale</a>s are occasionally seen offshore. <a href="Roosevelt%20elk">Roosevelt elk</a> are the most readily observed of the large mammals in the park. Successful herds, brought back from the verge of extinction in the region, are now common in park areas south of the <a href="Klamath%20River">Klamath River</a>. Many smaller mammals live in the high forest canopy. Different species of <a href="bat">bat</a>s, such as the <a href="big%20brown%20bat">big brown bat</a>, and other smaller mammals including the <a href="Douglas%20squirrel">red squirrel</a> and <a href="northern%20flying%20squirrel">northern flying squirrel</a> spend most of their lives well above the forest floor.

Brown pelicans and <a href="double-crested%20cormorant">double-crested cormorant</a>s are mainly found on cliffs along the coast and on seastacks, while <a href="sandpiper">sandpiper</a>s and <a href="gull">gull</a>s inhabit the seacoast and inland areas. Inland, freshwater-dependent birds such as the <a href="common%20merganser">common merganser</a>, <a href="osprey">osprey</a>, <a href="red-shouldered%20hawk">red-shouldered hawk</a>, <a href="great%20blue%20heron">great blue heron</a>, and <a href="Steller%27s%20jay">Steller's jay</a> are a few of the bird species that have been documented. At least 400 bird species have been documented in the forestlands.

<a href="Reptile">Reptile</a>s and <a href="amphibian">amphibian</a>s can also be found in the parks, with the <a href="Diadophis%20punctatus">northwestern ringneck snake</a>, <a href="northern%20red-legged%20frog">northern red-legged frog</a>, <a href="Pacific%20giant%20salamander">Pacific giant salamander</a>, and the <a href="rough-skinned%20newt">rough-skinned newt</a> most commonly seen.

Currently, there are over 200 exotic species known to live in Redwood National and State Parks. Of these thirty have been identified as <a href="invasive%20species">invasive species</a>, ten of these are considered threats to local species and ecosystems. Exotic species currently account for about a quarter of the total flora in the parks. Only about one percent of plant growth in old-growth areas are of exotic species, while areas such as the <a href="Bald%20Hills%20%28Humboldt%20County%29">Bald Hills</a> prairies have a relative cover of fifty to seventy-five percent exotic. The type of foreign vegetation also varies, with plants such as the <a href="English%20Ivy">English Ivy</a> (Hedera helix), <a href="Spotted%20Knapweed">Spotted Knapweed</a> (Centaurea maculosa), and the <a href="Poison%20Hemlock">Poison Hemlock</a> (Conium maculatum). The spotted knapweed and poison hemlock are both under consideration for addition to a high priority watch list maintained by the park system.

The northern coastal region of California, which includes RNSP and the adjacent offshore area, is the most <a href="seismic">seismic</a>ally active in the U.S. Frequent minor <a href="earthquake">earthquake</a>s in the park and offshore under the Pacific Ocean have resulted in shifting river channels, <a href="landslide">landslide</a>s, and <a href="erosion">erosion</a> of seaside cliffs. The <a href="North%20American%20Plate">North American</a>, <a href="Pacific%20Plate">Pacific</a>, and <a href="Gorda%20Plate">Gorda Plate</a>s are <a href="tectonic%20plates">tectonic plates</a> that all meet at the <a href="Mendocino%20Triple%20Junction">Mendocino Triple Junction</a>, only southwest of the parks. During the 1990s, more than nine <a href="Richter%20magnitude%20scale">magnitude</a> 6.0 earthquakes occurred along this <a href="Fault%20%28geology%29">fault</a> zone resulting in 1 death and major financial loss, and there is always potential for a major earthquake. The park ensures that visitors are aware of the potential for a major earthquake through the use of pamphlets and information posted throughout the parks. The threat of a <a href="tsunami">tsunami</a> is of particular concern, and visitors to the seacoast are told to seek higher ground immediately after any significant earthquake.

Both coastline and the <a href="Coast%20Ranges">Coast Ranges</a> can be found within park boundaries. The majority of the rocks in the parks are part of the <a href="Franciscan%20Assemblage">Franciscan Assemblage</a>, uplifted from the ocean floor millions of years ago. These <a href="sedimentary%20rock">sedimentary rock</a>s are primarily <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>, <a href="siltstone">siltstone</a>, <a href="shale">shale</a>, and <a href="chert">chert</a>, with lesser amounts of <a href="metamorphic%20rock">metamorphic rock</a>s such as <a href="Greenschist">greenstone</a>. For the most part, these rocks are easily eroded, and can be viewed along the seacoast and where rivers and streams have cut small gorges. Formed during the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> Period, they are highly deformed from <a href="Tectonic%20uplift">uplift</a> and <a href="Fold%20%28geology%29">folding</a> processes. In some areas, river systems have created <a href="fluvial">fluvial</a> deposits of sand, mud, and gravel, which are transported into the park from upstream. <a href="Redwood%20Creek%20%28Humboldt%20County%29">Redwood Creek</a> follows the <a href="Grogan%20Fault">Grogan Fault</a>; along the west bank of the creek, <a href="schist">schist</a> and other metamorphic rocks can be found, while sedimentary rocks of the Franciscan Assemblage are located on the east bank.

The Redwood National and State Parks have an <a href="oceanic%20climate">oceanic</a> <a href="temperate%20rainforest">temperate rainforest</a> climate, with <a href="warm-summer%20Mediterranean%20climate">cool-summer Mediterranean</a> characteristics. Weather in RNSP is greatly influenced by the Pacific Ocean. Coastal temperatures generally range between 40 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit (4–15 °C) all year round, while further from the coast summers are hotter and drier, and winters are colder. Redwoods mostly grow a mile or two (1.5–3 km) from the coast, and never more than from it. In this temperate but humid coastal zone, the trees receive moisture from both heavy winter rains and persistent summer fog. The presence and consistency of the summer fog is actually more important to overall health of the trees than heavy precipitation. This fact is born out in annual precipitation totals, which range between annually, with healthy redwood forests throughout the areas of less precipitation because excessive needs for water are mitigated by the ever-present summer fog and the cooler temperatures it ensures. Snow is uncommon even on peaks above , further exemplifying the mild, temperate nature of this northern latitude; however, light snow mixed with rain is common during the winter months.

<a href="Wildfire">Wildfire</a>s are a natural part of most terrestrial ecosystems. In many ways nature has adapted to fire, and the absence of fire can often be disadvantageous. Wildfire eliminates dead and decayed plant and tree matter, enriching the soil and ensuring that healthier trees have less competition for limited nutrients. <a href="Controlled%20burn">Prescribed fire</a> is currently part of the fire management plan and helps to eliminate <a href="exotic%20species">exotic species</a> of plants and allows a more fertile and natural ecosystem. Fire is also used to protect prairie grasslands and to keep out forest encroachment, ensuring sufficient rangeland for elk and deer. The oak forest regions also benefit from controlled burns, as Douglas fir would otherwise eventually take over and decrease <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a>. The use of fire in old-growth redwood zones reduces dead and decaying material, and lessens the mortality of larger redwoods by eliminating competing vegetation. In the park, a fire management plan monitors all fires, weather patterns and the fuel load (dead and decaying plant material). This fuel load is removed from areas near structures and where fire poses high risk to the public, and controlled burns are used elsewhere. The <a href="National%20Interagency%20Fire%20Center">National Interagency Fire Center</a> provides additional firefighters and equipment in the event of a large fire.

The DeMartin Redwood Youth Hostel, a low-amenities shared lodging facility (near <a href="Klamath%2C%20California">Klamath</a>), has now closed. There are no <a href="hotel">hotel</a>s or <a href="motel">motel</a>s within the parks boundaries. However, nearby towns such as Klamath, Requa, and Orick provide small hotels and inns, with extensive lodging options available in the regional trading centers of Crescent City on the northern end of the park and <a href="Arcata%2C%20California">Arcata</a> and <a href="Eureka%2C%20California">Eureka</a> located to the south. The park is about north of <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, and south of <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>; <a href="U.S.%20Route%20101">U.S. Route 101</a> passes through it from north to south. The <a href="Smith%20River%20National%20Recreation%20Area">Smith River National Recreation Area</a>, part of the <a href="Six%20Rivers%20National%20Forest">Six Rivers National Forest</a>, is adjacent to the north end of RNSP.

While the state parks have front country campsites that can be driven to, the federal sections of the park do not, and hiking is the only way to reach back country campsites. These are at Mill Creek campground in Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park and Jedediah Smith campground in Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park, which together have 251 campsites; the Elk Prairie campground in Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park which has 75; and the Gold Bluffs Beach campground which has 25 campsites. Other nearby state parks have additional front country camping.

Back country camping is by permit only and is only allowed in designated sites, except on gravel bars along <a href="Redwood%20Creek%20%28Humboldt%20County%29">Redwood Creek</a>. Access to the back country is highly regulated to prevent overuse while permitting as many groups as possible to explore the forest. Camping in the back country is therefore limited to five consecutive nights, and 15 nights in any one year. Proper food storage to minimize encounters with bears is strongly enforced, and hikers and backpackers are required to take out any trash they generate.

Almost of hiking trails exist in the parks, but during the rainy season some temporary footbridges are removed, as they would be destroyed by high streams. Throughout the year, trails are often wet and hikers need to be well prepared for rainy weather and consult information centers for updates on trail conditions.

<a href="Horseback">Horseback</a> riding and <a href="mountain%20biking">mountain biking</a> are popular but are only allowed on certain trails. <a href="Kayaking">Kayaking</a> is popular along the seacoast and in the various rivers and streams.

A California sport fishing license is required to fish any of the rivers and streams. Hunting is not permitted anywhere in the parks, but is allowed in nearby <a href="United%20States%20National%20Forest">National Forest</a>s.

The park has three visitor centers, where guided nature walks and general information are available, along with two additional information points. Each campground offers campfire talks during the summer months as well as guided tours. The parks have many <a href="picnic">picnic</a> areas, which are all easily accessed by vehicle.

The following three California State Parks are the only State Parks co-managed within the RNSP system:

Gerard K. O'Neill

Gerard Kitchen O'Neill (February 6, 1927 – April 27, 1992) was an American <a href="physicist">physicist</a> and <a href="Space%20advocacy">space activist</a>. As a faculty member of <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a>, he invented a device called the <a href="Storage%20ring">particle storage ring</a> for high-energy physics experiments. Later, he invented a magnetic launcher called the <a href="mass%20driver">mass driver</a>. In the 1970s, he developed a plan to build human settlements in outer space, including a <a href="space%20habitat">space habitat</a> design known as the <a href="O%27Neill%20cylinder">O'Neill cylinder</a>. He founded the <a href="Space%20Studies%20Institute">Space Studies Institute</a>, an organization devoted to funding research into <a href="space%20manufacturing">space manufacturing</a> and <a href="Space%20colonization">colonization</a>.

O'Neill began researching high-energy <a href="particle%20physics">particle physics</a> at <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton</a> in 1954, after he received his doctorate from <a href="Cornell%20University">Cornell University</a>. Two years later, he published his theory for a particle storage ring. This invention allowed <a href="particle%20accelerator">particle accelerator</a>s at much higher energies than had previously been possible. In 1965 at <a href="Stanford%20University">Stanford University</a>, he performed the first colliding beam physics experiment.

While teaching physics at Princeton, O'Neill became interested in the possibility that humans could survive and live in outer space. He researched and proposed a futuristic idea for human settlement in space, the O'Neill cylinder, in "The Colonization of Space", his first paper on the subject. He held a conference on <a href="space%20manufacturing">space manufacturing</a> at Princeton in 1975. Many who became post-<a href="Apollo%20program">Apollo</a>-era space activists attended. O'Neill built his first <a href="Mass%20Driver%201">mass driver prototype</a> with professor <a href="Henry%20Kolm">Henry Kolm</a> in 1976. He considered mass drivers critical for extracting the mineral resources of the <a href="Moon">Moon</a> and <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a>s. His award-winning book "" inspired a generation of space exploration advocates. He died of <a href="leukemia">leukemia</a> in 1992.

O'Neill was born in <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn, New York</a> on February 6, 1927 to Edward Gerard O'Neill, a lawyer, and Dorothy Lewis O'Neill (née Kitchen). He had no siblings. His family moved to <a href="Speculator%2C%20New%20York">Speculator, New York</a> when his father temporarily retired for health reasons. For high school, O'Neill attended <a href="Newburgh%20Free%20Academy">Newburgh Free Academy</a> in <a href="Newburgh%2C%20New%20York">Newburgh, New York</a>. While he was a student there he edited the school newspaper and took a job as a news broadcaster at a local radio station. He graduated in 1944, during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, and enlisted in the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> on his 17th birthday. The Navy trained him as a radar technician, which sparked his interest in science.

After he was honorably discharged in 1946, O'Neill studied physics and mathematics at <a href="Swarthmore%20College">Swarthmore College</a>. As a child he had discussed the possibilities of humans in space with his parents, and in college he enjoyed working on rocket equations. However, he did not see space science as an option for a career path in physics, choosing instead to pursue high-energy physics. He graduated with <a href="Phi%20Beta%20Kappa">Phi Beta Kappa</a> honors in 1950. O'Neill performed his graduate studies at <a href="Cornell%20University">Cornell University</a> with the help of an <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">Atomic Energy Commission</a> fellowship, and was awarded a <a href="Ph.D.">Ph.D.</a> in physics in 1954.

O'Neill married Sylvia Turlington, also a Swarthmore graduate, in June 1950. They had a son, Roger, and two daughters, Janet and Eleanor, before their marriage ended in divorce in 1966.

One of O'Neill's favorite activities was flying. He held instrument certifications in both powered and <a href="Glider%20%28sailplane%29">sailplane</a> flight and held the <a href="FAI%20Gliding%20Commission">FAI</a> Diamond Badge, a gliding award. During his first cross-country glider flight in April 1973, he was assisted on the ground by Renate "Tasha" Steffen. He had met Tasha, who was 21 years younger than him, previously through the <a href="YMCA">YMCA</a> International Club. They were married the day after his flight. They had a son, Edward O'Neill.

After graduating from Cornell, O'Neill accepted a position as an instructor at <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a>. There he started his research into high-energy <a href="particle%20physics">particle physics</a>. In 1956, his second year of teaching, he published a two-page article that theorized that the particles produced by a <a href="particle%20accelerator">particle accelerator</a> could be stored for a few seconds in a <a href="storage%20ring">storage ring</a>. The stored particles could then be directed to collide with another particle beam. This would increase the energy of the particle collision over the previous method, which directed the beam at a fixed target. His ideas were not immediately accepted by the physics community.

O'Neill became an assistant professor at Princeton in 1956, and was promoted to associate professor in 1959. He visited Stanford University in 1957 to meet with Professor <a href="Wolfgang%20K.%20H.%20Panofsky">Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky</a>. This resulted in a collaboration between Princeton and Stanford to build the Colliding Beam Experiment (CBX). With a US$800,000 grant from the <a href="Office%20of%20Naval%20Research">Office of Naval Research</a>, construction on the first particle storage rings began in 1958 at the Stanford High-Energy Physics Laboratory. He figured out how to capture the particles and, by pumping the air out to produce a <a href="vacuum">vacuum</a>, store them long enough to experiment on them. CBX stored its first beam on March 28, 1962. O'Neill became a full professor of physics in 1965.

In collaboration with <a href="Burton%20Richter">Burton Richter</a>, O'Neill performed the first colliding beam physics experiment in 1965. In this experiment, particle beams from the <a href="Stanford%20Linear%20Accelerator">Stanford Linear Accelerator</a> were collected in his storage rings and then directed to collide at an energy of 600 <a href="Electron%20volt">MeV</a>. At the time, this was the highest energy involved in a particle collision. The results proved that the charge of an electron is contained in a volume less than 100 <a href="Metre%23SI%20prefixed%20forms%20of%20metre">attometers</a> across. O'Neill considered his device to be capable of only seconds of storage, but, by creating an even stronger vacuum, others were able to increase this to hours. In 1979, he, with physicist David C. Cheng, wrote the graduate-level textbook "Elementary Particle Physics: An Introduction". He retired from teaching in 1985, but remained associated with Princeton as "professor emeritus" until his death.

O'Neill saw great potential in the United States space program, especially the <a href="Apollo%20program">Apollo missions</a>. He applied to the Astronaut Corps after NASA opened it up to civilian scientists in 1966. Later, when asked why he wanted to go on the Moon missions, he said, "to be alive now and not take part in it seemed terribly myopic". He was put through NASA's rigorous mental and physical examinations. During this time he met <a href="Brian%20O%27Leary">Brian O'Leary</a>, also a scientist-astronaut candidate, who became his good friend. O'Leary was selected for <a href="Astronaut%20Group%206">Astronaut Group 6</a> but O'Neill was not.

O'Neill became interested in the idea of space colonization in 1969 while he was teaching freshman physics at Princeton University. His students were growing cynical about the benefits of science to humanity because of the controversy surrounding the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. To give them something relevant to study, he began using examples from the Apollo program as applications of elementary physics. O'Neill posed the question during an extra seminar he gave to a few of his students: "Is the surface of a planet really the right place for an expanding technological civilization?" His students' research convinced him that the answer was no.

O'Neill was inspired by the papers written by his students. He began to work out the details of a program to build self-supporting space habitats in free space. Among the details was how to provide the inhabitants of a space colony with an Earth-like environment. His students had designed giant pressurized structures, spun up to approximate Earth gravity by <a href="centrifugal%20force">centrifugal force</a>. With the population of the colony living on the inner surface of a sphere or cylinder, these structures resembled "inside-out planets". He found that pairing counter-rotating cylinders would eliminate the need to spin them using rockets. This configuration has since been known as the "<a href="O%27Neill%20cylinder">O'Neill cylinder</a>".

Looking for an outlet for his ideas, O'Neill wrote a paper titled "The Colonization of Space", and for four years attempted to have it published. He submitted it to several journals and magazines, including "Scientific American" and "Science", only to have it rejected by the reviewers. During this time O'Neill gave lectures on space colonization at <a href="Hampshire%20College">Hampshire College</a>, Princeton, and other schools. Many students and staff attending the lectures became enthusiastic about the possibility of living in space. Another outlet for O'Neill to explore his ideas was with his children; on walks in the forest they speculated about life in a space colony. His paper finally appeared in the September 1974 issue of "<a href="Physics%20Today">Physics Today</a>". In it, he argued that building space colonies would solve several important problems: 

He explored the possibilities of flying gliders inside a space colony, finding that the enormous volume could support atmospheric thermals. He calculated that humanity could expand on this man-made frontier to 20,000 times its population. The initial colonies would be built at the Earth-Moon and <a href="Lagrangian%20point">Lagrange points</a>. and are stable points in the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a> where a spacecraft can maintain its position without expending energy. The paper was well received, but many who would begin work on the project had already been introduced to his ideas before it was even published. The paper received a few critical responses. Some questioned the practicality of lifting tens of thousands of people into orbit and his estimates for the production output of initial colonies.

While he was waiting for his paper to be published, O'Neill organized a small two-day conference in May 1974 at Princeton to discuss the possibility of colonizing outer space. The conference, titled "First Conference on Space Colonization", was funded by <a href="Stewart%20Brand">Stewart Brand's</a> <a href="Point%20Foundation%20%28environment%29">Point Foundation</a> and Princeton University. Among those who attended were <a href="Eric%20Drexler">Eric Drexler</a> (at the time a freshman at <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">MIT</a>), scientist-astronaut <a href="Joseph%20P.%20Allen">Joe Allen</a> (from Astronaut Group 6), <a href="Freeman%20Dyson">Freeman Dyson</a>, and science reporter <a href="Walter%20S.%20Sullivan">Walter Sullivan</a>. Representatives from NASA also attended and brought estimates of launch costs expected on the planned <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20program">Space Shuttle</a>. O'Neill thought of the attendees as "a band of daring radicals". Sullivan's article on the conference was published on the front page of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" on May 13, 1974. As media coverage grew, O'Neill was inundated with letters from people who were excited about living in space. To stay in touch with them, O'Neill began keeping a mailing list and started sending out updates on his progress. A few months later he heard <a href="Peter%20Glaser">Peter Glaser</a> speak about <a href="solar%20power%20satellite">solar power satellite</a>s at NASA's <a href="Goddard%20Space%20Flight%20Center">Goddard Space Flight Center</a>. O'Neill realized that, by building these satellites, his space colonies could quickly recover the cost of their construction. According to O'Neill, "the profound difference between this and everything else done in space is the potential of generating large amounts of new wealth".

O'Neill held a much larger conference the following May titled "Princeton University Conference on Space Manufacturing". At this conference more than two dozen speakers presented papers, including <a href="Keith%20Henson">Keith</a> and <a href="Carolyn%20Meinel">Carolyn Henson</a> from <a href="Tucson%2C%20Arizona">Tucson, Arizona</a>.

After the conference Carolyn Henson arranged a meeting between O'Neill and Arizona Congressman <a href="Mo%20Udall">Morris Udall</a>. Udall wrote a letter of support, which he asked the Hensons to publicize, for O'Neill's work. The Hensons included his letter in the first issue of the <a href="L5%20Society">L-5 Society</a> newsletter, sent to everyone on O'Neill's mailing list and those who had signed up at the conference.

In June 1975, O'Neill led a ten-week study of permanent space habitats at NASA Ames. During the study he was called away to testify on July 23 to the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House</a> Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications. On January 19, 1976, he also appeared before the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senate</a> Subcommittee on Aerospace Technology and National Needs. In a presentation titled "Solar Power from Satellites", he laid out his case for an Apollo-style program for building power plants in space. He returned to Ames in June 1976 and 1977 to lead studies on space manufacturing. In these studies, NASA developed detailed plans to establish bases on the Moon where space-suited workers would mine the mineral resources needed to build space colonies and solar power satellites.

Although NASA was supporting his work with grants of up to $500,000 per year, O'Neill became frustrated by the bureaucracy and politics inherent in government-funded research. He thought that small privately funded groups could develop space technology faster than government agencies. In 1977, O'Neill and his wife Tasha founded the <a href="Space%20Studies%20Institute">Space Studies Institute</a>, a non-profit organization, at Princeton University. SSI received initial funding of almost $100,000 from private donors, and in early 1978 began to support basic research into technologies needed for space manufacturing and settlement.
One of <a href="Space%20Studies%20Institute">SSI's</a> first grants funded the development of the <a href="mass%20driver">mass driver</a>, a device first proposed by O'Neill in 1974. Mass drivers are based on the <a href="coilgun">coilgun</a> design, adapted to accelerate a non-magnetic object. One application O'Neill proposed for mass drivers was to throw baseball-sized chunks of ore mined from the surface of the Moon into space. Once in space, the ore could be used as raw material for building space colonies and solar power satellites. He took a sabbatical from Princeton to work on mass drivers at MIT. There he served as the <a href="Jerome%20C.%20Hunsaker%20Visiting%20Professor%20of%20Aerospace%20Systems">Hunsaker Visiting Professor of Aerospace</a> during the 1976–77 academic year. At MIT, he, <a href="Henry%20Kolm">Henry H. Kolm</a>, and a group of student volunteers built their <a href="Mass%20Driver%201">first mass driver prototype</a>. The eight-foot (2.5 m) long prototype could apply 33 "<a href="g-force">g</a>" (320 m/s) of acceleration to an object inserted into it. With financial assistance from SSI, later prototypes improved this to 1,800 "g" (18,000 m/s), enough acceleration that a mass driver only 520 feet (160 m) long could launch material off the surface of the Moon.

In 1977, O'Neill saw the peak of interest in space colonization, along with the publication of his first book, "". He and his wife were flying between meetings, interviews, and hearings. On October 9, the <a href="CBS">CBS</a> program "<a href="60%20Minutes">60 Minutes</a>" ran a segment about space colonies. Later they aired responses from the viewers, which included one from Senator <a href="William%20Proxmire">William Proxmire</a>, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee responsible for NASA's budget. His response was, "it's the best argument yet for chopping NASA's funding to the bone ... I say not a penny for this nutty fantasy". He successfully eliminated spending on space colonization research from the budget. In 1978, <a href="Paul%20Werbos">Paul Werbos</a> wrote for the L-5 newsletter, "no one expects Congress to commit us to O'Neill's concept of large-scale space habitats; people in NASA are almost paranoid about the public relations aspects of the idea". When it became clear that a government-funded colonization effort was politically impossible, popular support for O'Neill's ideas started to evaporate.

Other pressures on O'Neill's colonization plan were the high cost of access to Earth orbit and the declining cost of energy. Building solar power stations in space was economically attractive when energy prices spiked during the <a href="1979%20energy%20crisis">1979 oil crisis</a>. When prices dropped in the early 1980s, funding for space solar power research dried up. His plan had also been based on NASA's estimates for the flight rate and launch cost of the Space Shuttle, numbers that turned out to have been wildly optimistic. His 1977 book quoted a Space Shuttle launch cost of $10 million, but in 1981 the subsidized price given to commercial customers started at $38 million. A 1985 accounting of the full cost of a launch in 1985 raised this as high as $180 million per flight, and later estimates as the Space Shuttle program neared its end in 2011 were much higher yet.

O'Neill was appointed by United States President <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> to the National Commission on Space in 1985. The commission, led by former NASA administrator <a href="Thomas%20O.%20Paine">Thomas Paine</a>, proposed that the government commit to opening the inner Solar System for human settlement within 50 years. Their report was released in May 1986, four months after the <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Challenger">Space Shuttle Challenger</a> broke up on ascent.

O'Neill's popular science book "" (1977) combined fictional accounts of space settlers with an explanation of his plan to build space colonies. Its publication established him as the spokesman for the space colonization movement. It won the <a href="Phi%20Beta%20Kappa%20Award%20in%20Science">Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science</a> that year, and prompted Swarthmore College to grant him an <a href="Honorary%20degree">honorary doctorate</a>. "The High Frontier" has been translated into five languages and remained in print as of 2008.

His 1981 book "" was an exercise in <a href="futures%20studies">futurology</a>. O'Neill narrated it as a visitor to Earth from a space colony beyond Pluto. The book explored the effects of technologies he called "drivers of change" on the coming century. Some technologies he described were space colonies, solar power satellites, <a href="anti-aging">anti-aging</a> drugs, <a href="Hydrogen%20vehicle">hydrogen-propelled cars</a>, climate control, and underground <a href="Maglev%20train">magnetic trains</a>. He left the social structure of the 1980s intact, assuming that humanity would remain unchanged even as it expanded into the Solar System. Reviews of "2081" were mixed. "New York Times" reviewer John Noble Wilford found the book "imagination-stirring", but <a href="Charles%20Nicol">Charles Nicol</a> thought the technologies described were unacceptably far-fetched.

In his book "The Technology Edge", published in 1983, O'Neill wrote about economic competition with Japan. He argued that the United States had to develop six industries to compete: <a href="Microfabrication">microengineering</a>, robotics, genetic engineering, <a href="Magnetic%20levitation">magnetic flight</a>, <a href="Flying%20car%20%28fiction%29">family aircraft</a>, and space science. He also thought that industrial development was suffering from short-sighted executives, self-interested unions, high taxes, and poor education of Americans. According to reviewer Henry Weil, O'Neill's detailed explanations of emerging technologies differentiated the book from others on the subject.

O'Neill founded Geostar Corporation to develop a satellite position determination system for which he was granted a patent in 1982. The system, primarily intended to track aircraft, was called Radio Determination Satellite Service (RDSS). In April 1983 Geostar applied to the FCC for a license to broadcast from three satellites, which would cover the entire United States. Geostar launched GSTAR-2 into <a href="geosynchronous%20orbit">geosynchronous orbit</a> in 1986. Its <a href="transmitter">transmitter</a> package permanently failed two months later, so Geostar began tests of RDSS by transmitting from other satellites. With his health failing, O'Neill became less involved with the company at the same time it started to run into trouble. In February 1991 Geostar filed for bankruptcy and its licenses were sold to <a href="Motorola">Motorola</a> for the <a href="Iridium%20satellite%20constellation">Iridium satellite constellation</a> project. Although the system was eventually replaced by <a href="Global%20Positioning%20System">GPS</a>, O'Neill made significant advances in the field of position determination.

O'Neill founded O'Neill Communications in Princeton in 1986. He introduced his Local Area Wireless Networking, or LAWN, system at the PC Expo in New York in 1989. The LAWN system allowed two computers to exchange messages over a range of a couple hundred feet at a cost of about $500 per node. O'Neill Communications went out of business in 1993; the LAWN technology was sold to Omnispread Communications. As of 2008, Omnispread continued to sell a variant of O'Neill's LAWN system.

On November 18, 1991, O'Neill filed a patent application for a <a href="vactrain">vactrain</a> system. He called the company he wanted to form "VSE International", for velocity, silence, and efficiency. However, the concept itself he called "<a href="Magnetic%20Flight">Magnetic Flight</a>". The vehicles, instead of running on a pair of tracks, would be elevated using electromagnetic force by a single track within a tube (permanent magnets in the track, with variable magnets on the vehicle), and propelled by electromagnetic forces through tunnels. He estimated the trains could reach speeds of up to 2,500 mph (4,000 km/h) — about five times faster than a jet airliner — if the air was evacuated from the tunnels. To obtain such speeds, the vehicle would accelerate for the first half of the trip, and then decelerate for the second half of the trip. The acceleration was planned to be a maximum of about one-half of the force of gravity. O'Neill planned to build a network of stations connected by these tunnels, but he died two years before his first patent on it was granted.

O'Neill was diagnosed with <a href="leukemia">leukemia</a> in 1985. He died on April 27, 1992, from complications of the disease at the <a href="Sequoia%20Hospital">Sequoia Hospital</a> in <a href="Redwood%20City%2C%20California">Redwood City, California</a>. He was survived by his wife Tasha, his ex-wife Sylvia, and his four children. A sample of his incinerated remains was <a href="Space%20burial">buried in space</a>. The vial containing his ashes was attached to a <a href="Pegasus%20%28rocket%29">Pegasus XL</a> rocket and launched into Earth orbit on April 21, 1997. It re-entered the atmosphere in May 2002.

O'Neill directed his Space Studies Institute to continue their efforts "until people are living and working in space". After his death, management of SSI was passed to his son Roger and colleague Freeman Dyson. SSI continued to hold conferences every other year to bring together scientists studying space colonization until 2001, then irregularly thereafter.

<a href="Henry%20Kolm">Henry Kolm</a> went on to start Magplane Technology in the 1990s to develop the magnetic transportation technology that O'Neill had written about. In 2007, Magplane demonstrated a working magnetic pipeline system to transport phosphate ore in Florida. The system ran at a speed of 40 mph (65 km/h), far slower than the high-speed trains O'Neill envisioned.

All three of the founders of the <a href="Space%20Frontier%20Foundation">Space Frontier Foundation</a>, an organization dedicated to opening the space frontier to human settlement, were supporters of O'Neill's ideas and had worked with him in various capacities at the Space Studies Institute. One of them, <a href="Rick%20Tumlinson">Rick Tumlinson</a>, describes three men as models for space advocacy: <a href="Wernher%20von%20Braun">Wernher von Braun</a>, Gerard K. O'Neill, and <a href="Carl%20Sagan">Carl Sagan</a>. Von Braun pushed for "projects that ordinary people can be proud of but not participate in". Sagan wanted to explore the universe from a distance. O'Neill, with his grand scheme for settlement of the Solar System, emphasized moving ordinary people off the Earth "en masse".

The <a href="National%20Space%20Society">National Space Society</a> (NSS) gives the Gerard K. O'Neill Memorial Award for Space Settlement Advocacy to individuals noted for their contributions in the area of space settlement. Their contributions can be scientific, legislative, and educational.

David Lovering

David Lovering (born December 6, 1961) is an American musician and <a href="Magic%20%28illusion%29">magician</a>. He is best known as the drummer for the <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> band <a href="Pixies">Pixies</a>, which he joined in 1986. After the band's breakup in 1993, Lovering drummed with several other acts, including <a href="The%20Martinis">The Martinis</a>, <a href="Cracker%20%28band%29">Cracker</a>, <a href="Nitzer%20Ebb">Nitzer Ebb</a> and <a href="Tanya%20Donelly">Tanya Donelly</a>. He also pursued a magic career as The Scientific Phenomenalist; performing scientific and physics-based experiments on stage. When the Pixies reunited in 2004, Lovering returned as the band's drummer.

As a drummer Lovering was inspired by bands from a variety of genres, including <a href="Rush%20%28band%29">Rush</a> and <a href="Steely%20Dan">Steely Dan</a>.

David Lovering was born in <a href="Burlington%2C%20Massachusetts">Burlington, Massachusetts</a>. He learned to play drums during his teenage years and joined his high school's marching band. According to his friend John Murphy, Lovering was always very "drum oriented" in his musical taste. In his high school yearbook entry, Lovering stated his three main ambitions: to be in a rock band, to be an electrical engineer, and to tour with Rush, his favorite band. After graduating from high school, Lovering studied <a href="electronic%20engineering">electronic engineering</a> at the <a href="Wentworth%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Wentworth Institute of Technology</a> in Boston. He got a job at a <a href="Radio%20Shack">Radio Shack</a> store with Murphy, and the pair often played practical jokes while at work. One such incident involved Lovering wiring the store toilet to a fire alarm. After graduating from Wentworth with an associate degree in 1985, he took a job building <a href="laser">laser</a>s, and continued to drum in local bands such as Iz Wizard and Riff Raff. A number of different genres of music have influenced him, including bands <a href="Steely%20Dan">Steely Dan</a>, <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>, and <a href="Devo">Devo</a>.

On <a href="Memorial%20Day">Memorial Day</a> 1985, Lovering attended Murphy and <a href="Kim%20Deal">Kim Deal</a>'s wedding service. In January 1986 Deal was hired to play bass in the newly formed Pixies, an <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> band formed by <a href="Black%20Francis">Charles "Black Francis" Thompson</a> and <a href="Joey%20Santiago">Joey Santiago</a>. Murphy suggested that Lovering audition for the band – who were still without a drummer. Lovering had stopped drumming by this point and was at first unimpressed by the trio's performance of the band's songs. However, after playing along he agreed to join. Lovering and the band wrote and rehearsed material throughout 1985 and 1986 and performed at small venues in <a href="Boston">Boston</a>. The band decided to record 18 songs for <a href="Pixies%20%28EP%29">a demo tape</a> in 1987. Lovering co-wrote one of the tape's songs, "Levitate Me" (his only major writing contribution to any Pixies song) and appeared on the cassette's front cover, jogging naked with his back turned to the camera. "Levitate Me" later appeared on the band's first release "<a href="Come%20on%20Pilgrim">Come on Pilgrim</a>", which included seven other songs taken from the demo tape.

The Pixies entered the studio again in 1988 to record their second album "<a href="Surfer%20Rosa">Surfer Rosa</a>". Lovering's contribution on songs such as "Bone Machine" – which begins with a 10-second drum solo – "Break My Body" and "River Euphrates" established his steady, accurate style. "<a href="Doolittle%20%28album%29">Doolittle</a>", the band's major label debut, followed in 1989. During the album's recording sessions, Thompson convinced Lovering to sing on "La La Love You", which had been written as a "dig at the very idea of a love song". The album's producer <a href="Gil%20Norton">Gil Norton</a> later said that during the sessions Lovering "went from not wanting to sing a note to 'I can't get him away from the microphone'. He was such a showman". In addition to drums and vocals, Lovering played bass guitar on the album's penultimate track, "Silver".

After the release of "Doolittle", the relationship between the band members became strained because of constant touring and the pressure of releasing three albums in two years. After the final date of the "Doolittle" "Fuck or Fight" tour in November 1989, the band was too exhausted to attend their end-of-tour party the following night and shortly afterwards announced a hiatus. After the band reconvened in mid-1990, Lovering moved to Los Angeles along with the rest of the band. The Pixies released two more albums, "<a href="Bossanova">Bossanova</a>" (1990) and "<a href="Trompe%20le%20Monde">Trompe le Monde</a>" (1991). Lovering sang lead vocals on the "<a href="Velouria">Velouria</a>" B-side "Make Believe"; a song about his admitted "obsession" with US singer-songwriter <a href="Debbie%20Gibson">Debbie Gibson</a>. The Pixies toured sporadically throughout 1991 and 1992. They eventually broke up in 1992, mostly due to tensions between Thompson and Deal, although it was not publicly announced until 1993.

Following the Pixies' breakup, Lovering drummed with several artists, including <a href="Nitzer%20Ebb">Nitzer Ebb</a>, but turned down an invitation to join the <a href="Foo%20Fighters">Foo Fighters</a>. Lovering then joined Santiago's band <a href="The%20Martinis">The Martinis</a>, appearing on their song "Free" on the soundtrack of "<a href="Empire%20Records">Empire Records</a>". However, he soon left the band to become a touring drummer for <a href="Cracker%20%28band%29">Cracker</a>. Lovering moved from band to band, drumming with <a href="Tanya%20Donelly">Tanya Donelly</a>'s group on 1997's "<a href="Lovesongs%20for%20Underdogs">Lovesongs for Underdogs</a>" and with Boston band Eeenie Meenie. After facing difficulty finding new work, Lovering gave up the drums and moved into a rented house that banned drumming.

Towards the end of the 1990s, Lovering's friend <a href="Grant-Lee%20Phillips">Grant-Lee Phillips</a> took him to a magic convention. Lovering was very impressed by some of the illusions, and later said "I had to learn how to do it". Mutual friend Carl Grasso invited them to a show at the <a href="The%20Magic%20Castle">Magic Castle</a>, a magic-oriented nightclub in Los Angeles. There Lovering met <a href="Possum%20Dixon">Possum Dixon</a> frontman <a href="Rob%20Zabrecky">Rob Zabrecky</a>, and the pair soon became friends. Zabrecky convinced Lovering to apply for a performers' membership to the Magic Castle. After gaining his membership, Lovering reinvented himself as "The Scientific Phenomenalist". His act combined his electrical engineering knowledge with his stage performance experience. His decision to pursue a career in magic was influenced by the fact that as a musician, he "couldn't top the Pixies".

As the Scientific Phenomentalist, Lovering performs science and <a href="physics">physics</a> experiments in a lab coat while on stage. He shuns traditional magic tricks, and prefers "things that are more mental, using mental powers". He later explained: "It's all kind of upbeat, really weird physics experiments that you'll never see. [...] I'd rather have them [the audience] going 'Is it [magic] or isn't it?' rather than 'It's all science' or 'It's all magic'. So I do kinda weird things that other magicians don't do". Lovering cites sleight-of-hand artist <a href="Ricky%20Jay">Ricky Jay</a>, mind reader <a href="Max%20Maven">Max Maven</a> and <a href="Eugene%20Burger">Eugene Burger</a> as influences on his technique. His performances often involve intricate self-built machines.

Lovering became part of <a href="The%20Unholy%20Three%20%28magic%20trio%29">The Unholy Three</a>, a trio of magicians that resides at the Magic Castle, and performs "a new wave, alternative, avant-garde kind of magic". He toured his act across the United States as the opener for <a href="Frank%20Black">Frank Black</a> (the new stage name of former Pixies bandmate Thompson), Grant-Lee Phillips, <a href="The%20Breeders">The Breeders</a> and <a href="Camper%20Van%20Beethoven">Camper Van Beethoven</a>. He performed his act at the <a href="Shellac%20%28band%29">Shellac</a>-curated <a href="All%20Tomorrow%27s%20Parties%20%28music%20festival%29">All Tomorrow's Parties</a> music festival in 2002. He later commented that his performance at the festival was "perhaps my greatest achievement". Lovering resumed drumming, appearing at some <a href="Frank%20Black%20and%20the%20Catholics">Frank Black and the Catholics</a> shows. He also appeared on one track of The Martinis' 2004 album "<a href="The%20Smitten%20Sessions">The Smitten Sessions</a>".

By the summer of 2003, Lovering was feeling depressed. In a 2004 interview, he commented: "I remember I was on the way to the bank, and I was just bummed out—everything, financially, was really a mess for me. I was involved in this relationship that was absolutely terrible. I was bottoming out. And I'm on the way to the bank and my cellphone rings. It's Joe [Santiago]; he says, 'Guess what?'" Santiago had just received a call from Thompson stating his desire to reunite the Pixies. Lovering was overjoyed at the news. He added that "the saddest thing is that when I sat down to rehearse for the Pixies, I couldn't believe that I had given up something that I loved". In 2004 Lovering and the band recorded their reunion single, "<a href="Bam%20Thwok">Bam Thwok</a>".

Lovering appeared in the 2006 documentary "loudQUIETloud", which covered the Pixies' 2004 reunion tour. His father died midway during the tour, and Lovering began drinking heavily as a result. According to Thompson, Lovering "messed up a couple of songs" during a number of live shows. "It was all caught on film", said Thompson, "but they re-edited this to look like it happened in the middle of our tour and it looked like this whole tour careened into this drunken stupor with David. It really wasn't like that at all". He toured with the Pixies throughout 2005 and 2006, while performing at the Magic Castle on Friday nights with The Unholy Three. In 2007, Lovering played a benefit concert for <a href="Wally%20Ingram">Wally Ingram</a> as part of The Martinis. Later that year, he formed a new band called The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, with Los Angeles musicians Amit Itelman and Oscar Rey.

Raptor Red

Raptor Red is a 1995 American novel by <a href="paleontologist">paleontologist</a> <a href="Robert%20T.%20Bakker">Robert T. Bakker</a>. The book is a third-person account of <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s during the <a href="Cretaceous%20Period">Cretaceous Period</a>, told from the point of view of Raptor Red, a female "<a href="Utahraptor">Utahraptor</a>". "Raptor Red" features many of Bakker's theories regarding dinosaurs' social habits, intelligence, and the world in which they lived.

The book follows a year in Raptor Red's life as she loses her mate, finds her family, and struggles to survive in a hostile environment. Bakker drew inspiration from <a href="Ernest%20Thompson%20Seton">Ernest Thompson Seton</a>'s works that look at life through the eyes of predators, and said that he found it "fun" to write from a <a href="Apex%20predator">top predator</a>'s perspective. Bakker based his portrayals of dinosaurs and other prehistoric wildlife on fossil evidence, as well as studies of modern animals.

When released, "Raptor Red" was generally praised: Bakker's <a href="anthropomorphism">anthropomorphism</a> was seen as a unique and positive aspect of the book, and his writing was described as folksy and heartfelt. Criticisms of the novel included a perceived lack of characterization and average writing. Some scientists, such as paleontologist <a href="David%20B.%20Norman">David B. Norman</a>, took issue with the scientific theories portrayed in the novel, fearing that the public would accept them as fact, while Discovery Channel host <a href="Jay%20Ingram">Jay Ingram</a> defended Bakker's creative decisions in an editorial.

Paleontologist Robert T. Bakker originally suggested the genus name "Utahraptor" for a new dinosaur specimen that had been found by an amateur bone-hunter in <a href="Utah">Utah</a>. Bakker was at the time consulting with the designers of the "<a href="Jurassic%20Park%20%28film%29">Jurassic Park</a>" film, whose largest portrayed "<a href="Velociraptor">Velociraptor</a>"—called the "big female" in the script—was coincidentally the same size as the newly discovered "Utahraptor". Bakker was motivated to write the book by both his interest in dinosaur behavior and his desire to marry science and entertainment, saying that "nature is a drama. It is the most ripping yarn ever written. You've got life and death and sex and betrayal and the best way to approach it is through individual animals." According to Bakker, "It was fun to put myself in the mind of a raptor, especially since being a top predator is so challenging ... much harder than [being] a herbivore." He credited the turn-of-the-century <a href="Naturalism%20%28philosophy%29">naturalist</a> <a href="Ernest%20Thompson%20Seton">Ernest Thompson Seton</a>'s works that focused on life from the perspectives of <a href="grizzly%20bear">grizzly bear</a>s and <a href="Gray%20wolf">wolves</a> as having inspired him to write the novel from the dinosaur's point of view.

"Raptor Red" was an attempt to introduce "Utahraptor" to the public, as well as explain some of Bakker's theories regarding dinosaur behavior. Bakker's raptors are shown as monogamous, relatively intelligent and social creatures, an assertion he defends, saying "the life of dinosaurian hunters was hard. Most skeletons we excavate have clear marks of old wounds. To survive and raise their young, the predators needed more than sharp teeth and strong claws. They needed social bonds." Bakker also advances his controversial theory that an asteroid impact did not kill the dinosaurs in the <a href="Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene%20extinction%20event">Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event</a>, but rather a disease spread through migration. 

Another of the novel's goals was to dispel the common perception of predators as evil and portray them as creatures to be admired and empathized with. "Being a top predator is difficult," Bakker said, noting that fossils of big predators often show multiple broken and healed bones, as well as signs of serious infections, all evidence of a harsh lifestyle. He continued, "Most predators had some trauma, they had been beaten up—for a simple reason: Dinner fights back." The behavior of the raptors and other animals featured in the novel was based on a combination of fossil evidence and observations of modern animals, such as <a href="Common%20chimpanzee">chimpanzee</a>s and alligators.

Bakker received a large advance for the novel from <a href="Bantam%20Books">Bantam Books</a>, rumored to be in the six-figure range. The book was prominently featured at the American Booksellers' Convention in Chicago, alongside <a href="Michael%20Crichton">Michael Crichton</a>'s "<a href="The%20Lost%20World%20%28Crichton%20novel%29">The Lost World</a>". Coverage of the event noted that both novels were on the trailing end of the dinosaur fad fueled by "Jurassic Park", as the new trend in American books was shifting toward politics in the aftermath of the <a href="United%20States%20elections%2C%201994">1994 US elections</a>.

"Raptor Red" was initially published as a mass-market paperback and hardcover book, and was later released as an <a href="audiobook">audiobook</a> by <a href="Simon%20%26amp%3B%20Schuster">Simon & Schuster</a> Audio, read by <a href="Megan%20Gallagher">Megan Gallagher</a>. Bakker's audiobook royalties—at least $34,000 by November 1995—were donated to the Tate Museum in <a href="Casper%2C%20Wyoming">Casper, Wyoming</a>, where he was curator.

"Raptor Red" takes place approximately 120 million years ago, in the <a href="Early%20Cretaceous">Early Cretaceous</a> <a href="period%20%28geology%29">period</a> of the <a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a>. At the time, a land bridge had formed between Asia and the Americas, this allowed groups of foreign dinosaurs to invade present-day Utah; one of these foreign species is "<a href="Utahraptor">Utahraptor</a>". Raptor Red's name comes from the symbols the dinosaur learns as a hatchling to self-identify with. Bakker gives an individual view of each species of dinosaur or ancient creature in the same style as Red's experiences; these include a baby "<a href="Gastonia%20%28dinosaur%29">Gastonia</a>" who instinctively attacks what it does not understand with its clubbed tail, and a whip-tailed <a href="diplodocid">diplodocid</a> who enjoys beating up predators. Bakker prominently features the adventures of a "fur-ball" (<a href="mammal">mammal</a>), "<a href="Aegialodon">Aegialodon</a>"; according to the author, the emphasis was added because the "Aegialodon" is on the direct ancestral line to humans. "Aegialodon", however, did not live in the same time and place as "Utahraptor", hailing from England about 136 million years ago. Some of the other animals featured in the novel were closer in time and place to "Utahraptor" but not strictly contemporary. For example, fossils attributable to "Acrocanthosaurus" and "Deinonychus" are known from the same rock formation as "Utahraptor" (the <a href="Cedar%20Mountain%20Formation">Cedar Mountain Formation</a>), but from sediments about five million years younger.

In the book's opening, the title character and her mate ambush a herd of "<a href="Astrodon">Astrodon</a>", which are large herbivorous <a href="sauropod">sauropod</a>s. The "Astrodon" are surprised, thinking that their bulk deters smaller predators. "Utahraptor", however, are much larger than any resident raptor, and proceed to take down an "Astrodon" with teamwork. When Red's mate climbs onto the dead "Astrodon", the corpse rolls in the mud, trapping the male under the bulk of the animal. Despite Red's best efforts, her mate <a href="suffocation">suffocates</a>. Despondent, Red wanders around the <a href="floodplain">floodplain</a>, nearly starving since a "Utahraptor" cannot successfully hunt big game on its own.

Red follows a familiar scent and is reunited with her sister, a single mother with three chicks. The two hunt together and bring food back to the nest for the young. A white <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a>, one Red has seen since she hatched, helps the two by finding carrion and prey in exchange for a helping of meat. On one hunting expedition, when the two adult "Utahraptor" are stalking a herd of "<a href="Iguanodon">Iguanodon</a>", Red spies a young male "Utahraptor" that is watching their prey. He begins a courtship dance for Red, but Red's sister chases him off, hissing. Her growls agitate the "Iguanodon", who <a href="stampede">stampede</a>; the male hastily leaves. After climbing into a tree to escape a <a href="flash%20flood">flash flood</a>, Red encounters the male raptor again, who performs a courtship dance while hanging onto the tree branches. Red's sister begrudgingly allows the male to stay with them, provided he steers clear of her chicks.

For a while, Red and her pack are happy, feeding off the plentiful <a href="carrion">carrion</a> left by receding flood waters, but the pack's way of life is upset by an invasion of large "<a href="Acrocanthosaurus">Acrocanthosaurus</a>", huge meat-eating dinosaurs. The added competition for food puts strain on the pack, as does the unexpected death of one of the chicks. A fight erupts between the male raptor and Red's sister. Red, torn between a prospective mate and her kin, tries to defuse the situation. Two "Acrocanthosaurus" watch the commotion and take the opportunity to attack the "Utahraptor". Meanwhile, a "<a href="Kronosaurus">Kronosaurus</a>" ambushes one of the chicks on the beach. Seeing the danger, Red lures the female "Acrocanthosaurus" into deep water where the larger predator is dragged under by the "Kronosaurus". Red saves her family, but at a price—her consort is forced away by Red's sister.

Facing continual threats from the "Acrocanthosaurus", Red, her sister and the chicks are forced up into the mountains. They encounter ice and snow for the first time, and kill a <a href="Therizinosaur">segnosaur</a> in a cave, turning the den into their nest. The older chick accompanies the two adults on hunting expeditions. One day the raptors encounter a strange creature they have never seen—a whip-tailed <a href="diplodocid">diplodocid</a> who inflicts wounds on Red and her sister; the older chick is forced to set off alone and find the pack's food. This calamity coincides with the arrival of a large pack of smaller raptors known as "<a href="Deinonychus">Deinonychus</a>". Sensing the weakness of the "Utahraptor" pack, they surround the nest and wait for the wounded raptors to become weak enough to attack.

Red's sister dies, and Red is crippled and defenseless against the smaller dinosaurs. The "Deinonychus" close in and wait for Red to die, but are driven back by a sudden attack—the older "Utahraptor" chick returns with Red's consort to defend the nest, driving back the "Deinonychus". Some time later, the old white pterosaur circles over Red's mountain stronghold, and finds the pack has grown considerably. Both Red and the older chick have found mates and have chicks, who are having fun rolling down a hill. The satisfied pterosaur leaves with a mate and offspring of his own.


"Raptor Red" was favorably received by critics and the mainstream press. Much praise was given to Bakker's anthropomorphising of the dinosaurs; a reviewer for the "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a>" said that ""Raptor Red" does for dinosaurs what some nature writing does for creatures alive today: it turns data into stories. And stories are what all of us need to make these animals—even dinosaurs—come alive." Mark Nichols of "<a href="Maclean%27s">Maclean's</a>" said that Bakker's success lay in making the reader hope that the dinosaurs were indeed creatures as Bakker portrayed.

In contrast to this positive reception, "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" felt that the anthropomorphising of the dinosaurs veered close to "a Disney cartoon." Other criticisms from the press included a lack of character needed for truly engrossing fiction. Reviewers described Bakker's work as "thoroughly heartfelt," despite flaws such as inconsistent writing; Men's News Daily, a site which focuses on social values, suggested that Bakker's raptors "possess a quaint, special appeal in today's social climate". Megan Gallagher's narration of the audiobook, combined with continuous sound effects and dramatic music to create an "aural picture," was also praised. "Entertainment Weekly" gave "Raptor Red" its "Best of Breed Award" for a "captivating novel about animal life".

Many critical reviews of the work came from scientists who objected to Bakker's looseness with scientific fact. The paleontologist Thomas Holtz noted that Bakker combined <a href="fauna">fauna</a> in ways not directly supported by the <a href="fossil%20record">fossil record</a>; for example, several of the dinosaurs featured in the books lived millions of years after "Utahraptor" died out. Michael Taylor, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the National Museums of Scotland, panned the book, saying that ""Raptor Red" is an accurate portrayal only within the context of uncertainties over the reconstruction of fossil animals as living forms ... Bakker's postscript never really admits these uncertainties." <a href="David%20B.%20Norman">David B. Norman</a> criticized the book as "no more than a children's adventure story—and a rather poorly written one at that ... The merging of science and fantasy is at its worst in books like "Raptor Red" because none but the experts can disentangle fact from fiction; this type of nonsense turns an uninformed reader into a misinformed one." <a href="Jay%20Ingram">Jay Ingram</a>, from the <a href="Discovery%20Channel">Discovery Channel</a>, published a rebuttal, saying, "The most important point is that Bakker's portrayal of the dinosaurs in "Raptor Red" is vivid—vivid in a way few museum displays or factual accounts can be. And if it turns out in the long run that some of the speculation is unwarranted, who cares? Bob Bakker has given us a unique window onto the era of dinosaurs."

According to Bakker, the novel's success led to interest in a movie deal from Hollywood. According to "<a href="Daily%20Variety">Daily Variety</a>" in 1996, producer Robert Halmi Sr. made deals with <a href="Jim%20Henson%27s%20Creature%20Shop">Jim Henson's Creature Shop</a> for film adaptations of "<a href="Animal%20Farm%20%28novel%29">Animal Farm</a>" and "Raptor Red". No official project has been announced.

Operation Mincemeat was a successful British <a href="disinformation">deception operation</a> of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> to disguise the 1943 <a href="Allied%20invasion%20of%20Sicily">Allied invasion of Sicily</a>. Two members of British intelligence obtained the body of <a href="Glyndwr%20Michael">Glyndwr Michael</a>, a <a href="tramp">tramp</a> who died from eating <a href="rat%20poison">rat poison</a>, dressed him as an officer of the <a href="Royal%20Marines">Royal Marines</a> and placed personal items on him identifying him as the fictitious <a href="Captain%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29">Captain</a> (<a href="Acting%20%28rank%29">Acting</a> <a href="Major%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Major</a>) William Martin.

Part of the wider <a href="Operation%20Barclay">Operation Barclay</a>, Mincemeat was based on the 1939 <a href="Trout%20memo">Trout memo</a>, written by <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="John%20Henry%20Godfrey">John Godfrey</a>, the Director of the <a href="Naval%20Intelligence%20Division">Naval Intelligence Division</a> and his personal assistant, Lieutenant Commander <a href="Ian%20Fleming">Ian Fleming</a>. With the approval of the British Prime Minister, <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> and the military commander in the Mediterranean, General <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D.

The <a href="Spain%20during%20World%20War%20II">neutral</a> Spanish government shared copies of the documents with the , the German military intelligence organisation, before returning the originals to the British. Forensic examination showed they had been read and <a href="Ultra">Ultra</a> decrypts of German messages showed that the Germans fell for the ruse. Reinforcements were shifted to Greece and Sardinia before and during the invasion of Sicily; Sicily received none.

The effect of Operation Mincemeat is unknown, although Sicily was liberated more quickly than anticipated and losses were lower than predicted. The events were depicted in "Operation Heartbreak", a 1950 novel by the former cabinet minister <a href="Duff%20Cooper">Duff Cooper</a>, before one of the agents who planned and carried out Mincemeat, <a href="Ewen%20Montagu">Ewen Montagu</a>, wrote a history in 1953. Montagu's work formed the basis for the 1956 British film "<a href="The%20Man%20Who%20Never%20Was">The Man Who Never Was</a>".

On 29 September 1939, soon after the start of the Second World War, <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="John%20Henry%20Godfrey">John Godfrey</a>, the <a href="Naval%20Intelligence%20Division">Director of Naval Intelligence</a>, circulated the <a href="Trout%20memo">Trout memo</a>, a paper that compared the deception of an enemy in wartime to <a href="fly%20fishing">fly fishing</a>. The historian <a href="Ben%20Macintyre">Ben Macintyre</a> observes that although the paper was published under Godfrey's name, it "bore all the hallmarks of ... <a href="Lieutenant%20commander%23United%20Kingdom">Lieutenant Commander</a> <a href="Ian%20Fleming">Ian Fleming</a>", Godfrey's <a href="personal%20assistant">personal assistant</a>. The memo contained a number of schemes to be considered for use against the <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis powers</a> to lure <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s and German surface ships towards minefields. Number 28 on the list was titled: "A Suggestion (not a very nice one)"; it was an idea to plant misleading papers on a corpse that would be found by the enemy.

The deliberate planting of fake documents to be found by the enemy was not new; known as the <a href="Richard%20Meinertzhagen%23Sinai%20Desert%20and%20the%20Haversack%20Ruse">Haversack Ruse</a>, it had been practised by the British and others in the First and Second World Wars. In August 1942, before the <a href="Battle%20of%20Alam%20el%20Halfa">Battle of Alam el Halfa</a>, a corpse was placed in a blown-up scout car, in a minefield facing the German <a href="90th%20Light%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">90th Light Division</a>. On the corpse was a map purportedly showing the locations of British minefields; the Germans used the map, and their tanks were routed to areas of soft sand where they bogged down.

In September 1942 an aircraft flying from Britain to <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> crashed off <a href="C%C3%A1diz">Cádiz</a>. All aboard were killed, including Paymaster-Lieutenant James Hadden Turner – a courier carrying top secret documents – and a French agent. Turner's documents included a letter from General <a href="Mark%20W.%20Clark">Mark Clark</a>, the American Deputy Commander of the <a href="Supreme%20Headquarters%20Allied%20Expeditionary%20Force">Allied Expeditionary Force</a>, to General <a href="Noel%20Mason-MacFarlane">Noel Mason-MacFarlane</a>, British Governor and Commander in Chief of Gibraltar, informing him that General <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>, the Supreme Commander, would arrive in Gibraltar on the eve of <a href="Operation%20Torch">Operation Torch</a>'s "target date" of 4November. Turner's body washed up on the beach near <a href="Tarifa">Tarifa</a> and was recovered by the Spanish authorities. When the body was returned to the British, the letter was still on it, and technicians determined that the letter had not been opened. Other Allied intelligence sources established that the notebook carried by the French agent had been copied by the Germans, but they dismissed it as being <a href="disinformation">disinformation</a>. To British planners it showed that some material that was obtained by the Spanish was being passed to the Germans.

A month after the Turner crash, the British intelligence officer Charles Cholmondeley outlined his own variation of the Trout memo plan, codenamed Trojan Horse, after the <a href="Trojan%20Horse">Achaean deception</a> from the <a href="Trojan%20War">Trojan War</a>. His plan was

Cholmondeley was a <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) who had been seconded to <a href="MI5">MI5</a>, Britain's domestic <a href="counter-intelligence">counter-intelligence</a> and security service. He had been appointed as the secretary of the <a href="Twenty%20Committee">Twenty Committee</a>, a small inter-service, inter-departmental intelligence team in charge of <a href="double%20agent">double agent</a>s. In November 1942 the Twenty Committee turned down Cholmondeley's plan as being unworkable, but thought there may have been some potential in the idea. As there was a naval connection to the plan, <a href="John%20Cecil%20Masterman">John Masterman</a>, the chairman of the committee, assigned <a href="Ewen%20Montagu">Ewen Montagu</a>, the naval representative, to work with Cholmondeley to develop the plan further. Montagu – a peacetime lawyer and <a href="Queen%27s%20Counsel">King's Counsel</a> who had volunteered at the outbreak of the war – worked under Godfrey at the Naval Intelligence Division, where he ran NID 17(M), the sub-branch which handled counter-espionage work. Godfrey had also appointed Montagu to oversee all naval deception involving double agents. As part of his duties, Montagu had been briefed on the need for deception operations to aid the Allied war aims in a forthcoming invasion operation in the Mediterranean.

In late 1942, with the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> success in the <a href="North%20African%20Campaign">North African Campaign</a>, military planners turned to the next target. British planners considered that an invasion of France from Britain could not take place until 1944 and the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a>, <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, wanted to use the Allied forces from North Africa to attack Europe's "soft underbelly". There were two possible targets for the Allies to attack. The first option was Sicily; control of the island would open the Mediterranean Sea to Allied shipping and allow the invasion of continental Europe through Italy. The second option was to go into Greece and the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>, to trap the German forces between the British and American invaders and the Soviets. At the <a href="Casablanca%20Conference">Casablanca Conference</a> in January 1943, Allied planners agreed on the selection of Sicily – codenamed <a href="Operation%20Husky">Operation Husky</a> – and decided to undertake the invasion no later than July. There was concern among the Allied planners that Sicily was an obvious choice – Churchill is reputed to have said "Everyone but a bloody fool would know that it's Sicily" – and that the build-up of resources for the invasion would be detected.

<a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> was concerned about a Balkan invasion, as the area had been the source of raw materials for the German war industry, including copper, bauxite, chrome and oil. The Allies knew of Hitler's fears, and they launched <a href="Operation%20Barclay">Operation Barclay</a>, a deception operation to play upon his concerns and to mislead the Germans into thinking the Balkans were the objective, diverting resources from Sicily. The deception reinforced German strategic thinking about the likely British target. To suggest the eastern Mediterranean was the target, the Allies set up a headquarters in Cairo, Egypt, for a fictional formation, the <a href="Twelfth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Twelfth Army</a>, consisting of twelve divisions. Military manoeuvres were conducted in Syria, with numbers inflated by dummy tanks and armoured vehicles to deceive observers. Greek interpreters were recruited and the Allies stockpiled Greek maps and currency. False communications about troop movements were generated from the Twelfth Army headquarters, while the Allied command post in Tunis – which was to be the headquarters of the Sicily invasion – reduced radio traffic by using land-lines wherever possible.

Montagu and Cholmondeley were assisted by an <a href="MI6">MI6</a> representative, Major <a href="Frank%20Foley">Frank Foley</a>, as they examined the practicalities of the plan. Montagu approached the <a href="pathologist">pathologist</a> Sir <a href="Bernard%20Spilsbury">Bernard Spilsbury</a> to determine what kind of body they needed and what factors they would need to take into account to fool a Spanish pathologist. Spilsbury informed him that those who died in an air crash often did so from shock and not drowning; the lungs would not necessarily be filled with water. He added that "Spaniards, as <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholics</a>, were averse to post-mortems and did not hold them unless the cause of death was of great importance". Spilsbury advised that a person could have suffered one of many different causes of death, which could be misconstrued in an autopsy. Montagu later wrote

This meant that not only would they have a better degree of success than they previously thought, but that there would be a larger number of corpses potentially available for selection when the time came. When Montagu discussed the possibility of obtaining a corpse with <a href="Bentley%20Purchase">Bentley Purchase</a>, the coroner for the Northern District of London, he was told there would be practical and legal difficulties: "I should think bodies are the only commodities not in short supply at the moment [but] even with bodies all over the place, each one has to be accounted for". Purchase promised to look out for a body that was suitable, with no relatives who would claim the corpse for burial.

On 28 January 1943 Purchase contacted Montagu with the news he had located a suitable body, probably that of <a href="Glyndwr%20Michael">Glyndwr Michael</a>, a tramp who died from eating rat poison that contained <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>. Purchase informed Montagu and Cholmondeley that the small amount of poison in the system would not be identified in a body that was supposed to have been floating in the sea for several days. When Montagu commented that the under-nourished corpse did not look like a fit field officer, Purchase informed him that "he does not have to look like an officer – only a staff officer", more used to office work. Purchase agreed to keep the body in the mortuary refrigerator at a temperature of – any colder and the flesh would freeze, which would be obvious after the body defrosted. He warned Montagu and Cholmondeley that the body had to be used within three months, after which it would have decomposed past the point of usefulness.

Montagu refused to identify the individual and only identified him as "a bit of a ne'er-do-well, and that the only worthwhile thing that he ever did he did after his death". In 1996 Roger Morgan, an amateur historian from London, uncovered evidence in the <a href="Public%20Record%20Office">Public Record Office</a> that the identity of the corpse was <a href="Glyndwr%20Michael">Glyndwr Michael</a>. An alternative theory to the corpse's identity was suggested in the history "The Secrets of HMS Dasher" (2004) that in March 1943 there was an explosion on , which sank, killing 379 men; one of these corpses was purportedly used. The military historian Denis Smyth dismisses the suggestion and observes that the official records of the operation state that Michael was the body.

Montagu selected the code name Mincemeat from a list of centrally held available possibilities. On 4 February 1943 Montagu and Cholmondeley filed their plan for the operation with the Twenty Committee; it was a re-working of Cholmondeley's Trojan Horse plan. The Mincemeat plan was to place documents on the corpse, and then float it off the coast of Spain, whose <a href="Spain%20during%20World%20War%20II">nominally neutral government</a> was known to co-operate with the , the German military intelligence organisation. The plan was passed by the committee, who passed it up the <a href="chain%20of%20command">chain of command</a> to the senior Allied strategists; Montagu and Cholmondeley were ordered to continue with their preparations for the operation.

Montagu and Cholmondeley began to create a "legend" – a fictitious background and character – for the body. The name and rank chosen was <a href="Captain%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29">Captain</a> (<a href="Acting%20%28rank%29">Acting</a> <a href="Major%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Major</a>) William Martin, of the <a href="Royal%20Marines">Royal Marines</a> assigned to <a href="Combined%20Operations%20Headquarters">Combined Operations Headquarters</a>. The name "Martin" was selected because there were several men with that name of about that rank in the Royal Marines. As a Royal Marine, Major Martin came under <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> authority, and it would be easy to ensure that all official inquiries and messages about his death would be routed to the <a href="Naval%20Intelligence%20Division">Naval Intelligence Division</a>. Additionally, Royal Marines would wear <a href="British%20Battledress">battledress</a>, which was easily obtainable and came in standard sizes. The rank of acting major made him senior enough to be entrusted with sensitive documents, but not so prominent that anyone would expect to know him.
To reinforce the impression of Martin being a real person, Montagu and Cholmondeley provided corroborative details to be carried on his person – known in espionage circles as wallet or <a href="pocket%20litter">pocket litter</a>. These included a photograph from an invented fiancée named Pam; the image was of an <a href="MI5">MI5</a> clerk, Jean Leslie. Two love letters from Pam were included in the pocket litter, as was a receipt for a diamond engagement ring costing £53 10s 6d from a <a href="Bond%20Street">Bond Street</a> jewellery shop. Additional personal correspondence was included, consisting of a letter from the fictitious Martin's father – described by Macintyre as "pompous and pedantic as only an Edwardian father could be" – which included a note from the family solicitor, and a message from <a href="Lloyds%20Bank">Lloyds Bank</a>, demanding payment of an overdraft of £79 19s 2d. To ensure that the letters would remain legible after immersion in seawater, Montagu asked MI5 scientists to conduct tests on different inks to see which would last longest in the water, and they provided him with a suitable list of popular and available ink brands.

Other items of pocket litter placed on Martin included a book of stamps, a silver cross and a <a href="Saint%20Christopher">St. Christopher's</a> medallion, cigarettes, matches, a pencil stub, keys and a receipt from <a href="Gieves%20%26amp%3B%20Hawkes">Gieves</a> for a new shirt. To provide a date that Martin had been in London, ticket stubs from a London theatre and a bill for four nights' lodging at the <a href="Naval%20and%20Military%20Club">Naval and Military Club</a> were added. Along with the other items placed on him, an itinerary of his activity in London could be constructed from 18 to 24 April.
Attempts were made to photograph the corpse for the naval identity card Martin would have to carry, but the results were unsatisfactory, and it was obvious that the images were of a cadaver. Montagu and Cholmondeley conducted a search for people who resembled the corpse, finding Captain <a href="Ronnie%20Reed">Ronnie Reed</a> of MI5; Reed agreed to be photographed for the identity card, wearing Royal Marine uniform. As the three cards and passes needed looked too new for a long-serving officer, they were issued as recent replacements for lost originals. Montagu spent the next few weeks rubbing all three cards on his trousers to provide a used sheen to them. To provide a used look to the uniform, it was worn by Cholmondeley, who was about the same build. The only non-issue part to the uniform was the underwear, which was in short supply in war-rationed Britain, so a pair of good-quality woollen underwear, owned by the late <a href="H.%20A.%20L.%20Fisher">Herbert Fisher</a>, the Warden of <a href="New%20College%2C%20Oxford">New College, Oxford</a>, was used.

Montagu outlined three criteria for the document that contained the details of the falsified plans to land in the Balkans. He said that the target should be casually but clearly identified, that it should name Sicily and another location as cover, and that it should be in an unofficial correspondence that would not normally be sent by <a href="diplomatic%20courier">diplomatic courier</a>, or encoded signal.
The main document was a personal letter from Lieutenant General Sir <a href="Archibald%20Nye">Archibald Nye</a>, vice chief of the <a href="Imperial%20General%20Staff">Imperial General Staff</a> – who had a deep knowledge of ongoing military operations – to General Sir <a href="Harold%20Alexander%2C%201st%20Earl%20Alexander%20of%20Tunis">Harold Alexander</a>, commander of the Anglo-American <a href="18th%20Army%20Group">18th Army Group</a> in Algeria and Tunisia under General Eisenhower. After several attempts at drafting the document did not generate something that was considered natural, it was suggested that Nye should draw up the letter himself to cover the required points. The letter covered several purportedly sensitive subjects, such as the (unwanted) award of <a href="Purple%20Heart">Purple Heart</a> medals by US forces to British servicemen serving with them and the appointment of a new commander of the <a href="Brigade%20of%20Guards">Brigade of Guards</a>. Montagu thought the result was "quite brilliant"; the key part of the letter stated that

There was also a letter of introduction for Martin from his putative commanding officer, Vice-Admiral <a href="Louis%20Mountbatten%2C%201st%20Earl%20Mountbatten%20of%20Burma">Lord Louis Mountbatten</a>, the chief of Combined Operations, to Admiral of the Fleet Sir <a href="Andrew%20Cunningham%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Cunningham%20of%20Hyndhope">Andrew Cunningham</a>, the commander-in-chief <a href="Mediterranean%20Fleet">Mediterranean Fleet</a> and Allied naval commander in the Mediterranean. Martin was referred to in the letter as an amphibious warfare expert on loan until "the assault is over". The document included a clumsy joke about <a href="sardine">sardine</a>s, which Montagu inserted in the hope that the Germans would see it as a reference to a planned invasion of Sardinia. A single black eyelash was placed within the letter to check if the Germans or Spanish had opened it.

Montagu considered that there would be a possible "Roman Catholic prejudice against tampering with corpses", which could miss the documents stored in the corpse's pockets, so they added them to an official briefcase that would not be overlooked. To justify carrying documents in a briefcase, Major Martin was given two proof copies of the official pamphlet on combined operations written by the author <a href="Hilary%20Saint%20George%20Saunders">Hilary Saunders</a> – then on Mountbatten's staff – and a letter from Mountbatten to Eisenhower, asking him to write a brief foreword for the pamphlet's US edition. The planning team first thought of having the handle clutched in the corpse's hand, held in place by "<a href="rigor%20mortis">rigor mortis</a>", but the rigor would probably wear off and the briefcase would drift away. They therefore equipped Martin with a leather-covered chain, such as was used by bank and jewellery couriers to secure their cases against snatching. The chain unobtrusively runs down a sleeve to the case. To Montagu it seemed unlikely that the major would keep the bag secured to his wrist during the long flight from Britain, so the chain was looped around the belt of his <a href="trench%20coat">trench coat</a>.

Montagu and Cholmondeley gave consideration to the location of the corpse's delivery. It had long been assumed by the pair that the western coast of Spain would be the ideal location. Early in the planning they investigated the possibility of Portuguese and French coasts, but rejected those in favour of <a href="Huelva">Huelva</a> on the coast of southern Spain, after advice was taken from the <a href="Hydrographer%20of%20the%20Navy">Hydrographer of the Navy</a> regarding the tides and currents best suited to ensure the body landed where it was wanted. Montagu later outlined that the choice of Huelva was also made because "there was a very active German agent ... who had excellent contacts with certain Spaniards, both officials and others". The agent – Adolf Clauss, a member of the – was the son of the German consul, and operated under the cover of an agriculture technician; he was an efficient and effective operative. Huelva was also chosen because the British vice-consul in the city, Francis Haselden, was "a reliable and helpful man" who could be relied upon, according to Montagu.
The body was supposed to be the victim of an aeroplane crash, and it was decided that to try and simulate the accident at sea using <a href="flare">flare</a>s and other devices could be too risky and open to discovery. After <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a>s and surface ships were dismissed as being problematic, a <a href="submarine">submarine</a> was chosen as the method of delivering the corpse to the region. To transport the body by submarine, it needed to be contained within the body of the boat, as any externally mounted container would have to be built with a skin so thick it would alter the level of the waterline. The canister needed to remain airtight and keep the corpse as fresh as possible through its journey. Spilsbury provided the medical requirements and Cholmondeley contacted <a href="Charles%20Fraser-Smith">Charles Fraser-Smith</a> of the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Supply">Ministry of Supply</a> to produce the container, which was labelled "Handle with care: optical instruments".

On 13 April 1943 the committee of the Chiefs of Staff met and agreed that they thought the plan should proceed. The committee informed Colonel <a href="John%20Bevan%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">John Bevan</a> – the head of <a href="London%20Controlling%20Section">London Controlling Section</a>, which controlled the planning and co-ordination of deception operations – that he needed to obtain final approval from Churchill. Two days later Bevan met the prime minister – who was in bed, wearing a dressing gown and smoking a cigar – in his rooms at the <a href="Churchill%20War%20Rooms">Cabinet War offices</a> and explained the plan. He warned Churchill that there were several aspects that could go wrong, including that the Spaniards might pass the corpse back to the British, with the papers unread. Churchill replied that "in that case we shall have to get the body back and give it another swim". Churchill gave his approval to the operation, but delegated the final confirmation to Eisenhower, the overall military commander in the Mediterranean, whose plan to invade Sicily would be affected. Bevan sent an encrypted telegram to Eisenhower's headquarters in Algeria requesting final confirmation, which was received on 17 April.

In the early hours of 17 April 1943 the corpse of Michael was dressed as Martin, although there was one last-minute hitch: the feet had frozen. Purchase, Montagu and Cholmondeley could not put the boots on, so an electric fire was located and the feet defrosted enough to put the boots on properly. The pocket litter was placed on the body, and the briefcase attached. The body was placed in the canister, which was filled with of <a href="dry%20ice">dry ice</a> and sealed up. When the dry ice <a href="sublimation%20%28phase%20transition%29">sublimated</a>, it filled the canister with <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> and drove out any oxygen, thus preserving the body without refrigeration. The canister was placed in the 1937 <a href="Fordson">Fordson</a> van of an MI5 driver <a href="St.%20John%20Horsfall">St. John "Jock" Horsfall</a>, who had been a racing champion before the war. Cholmondeley and Montagu travelled in the back of the van, which drove through the night to <a href="Greenock">Greenock</a>, west Scotland, where the canister was taken on board the submarine . "Seraph"s commander, Lt. <a href="Norman%20Jewell">Bill Jewell</a>, and crew had previous special operations experience. Jewell told his men that the canister contained a top secret <a href="meteorology">meteorological</a> device to be deployed near Spain.

On 19 April "Seraph" set sail and arrived just off the coast of Huelva on 29 April after having been bombed twice en route. After spending the day reconnoitreing the coastline, at 4:15 am on 30 April, "Seraph" surfaced. Jewell had the canister brought up on deck, then sent all his crew below except the officers. They opened the container and lowered the body into the water. Jewell read <a href="Psalm%2039">Psalm 39</a> and ordered the engines to full astern; the wash from the <a href="Propeller">screws</a> pushed the corpse toward the shore. The canister was reloaded and the submarine travelled 12 miles out where it surfaced and the empty container was pushed into the water. As it floated, it was riddled with machine gun fire so that it would sink. Because of the air trapped in the insulation, this effort failed, and the canister was destroyed with plastic explosives. Jewell afterwards sent a message to the Admiralty to say "Mincemeat completed", and continued on to Gibraltar.

The body of "Major Martin" was found at around 9:30 am on 30 April 1943 by a local fisherman; it was taken to Huelva by Spanish soldiers, where it was handed over to a naval judge. Haselden, as vice-consul, was officially informed by the Spaniards; he reported back to the Admiralty that the body and briefcase had been found. A series of pre-scripted <a href="diplomatic%20cable">diplomatic cable</a>s were sent between Haselden and his superiors, which continued for several days. The British knew that these were being intercepted and, although they were <a href="encrypted">encrypted</a>, the Germans had broken the code; the messages played out the story that it was imperative that Haselden retrieve the briefcase because it was important.

At midday on 1May an autopsy was undertaken on Michael's body; Haselden was present and – in order to minimise the possibilities that the two Spanish doctors identified that the body was a three-month old corpse – Haselden asked if, in the heat of the day and smell of the corpse, the doctors should bring the post mortem to a close and have lunch. They agreed and signed a death certificate for Major William Martin for "asphyxiation through immersion in the sea"; the body was released by the Spanish and, as Major Martin, was buried in the San Marco section of Nuestra Señora cemetery in Huelva, with full military honours on 2May.
The Spanish navy retained the briefcase and, despite pressure from Adolf Clauss and some of his agents, neither it or its contents were handed over to the Germans. On 5May the briefcase was passed to the naval headquarters at <a href="San%20Fernando%2C%20C%C3%A1diz">San Fernando</a> near <a href="Cadiz">Cadiz</a>, for forwarding to Madrid. While at San Fernando the contents were photographed by German sympathisers, but the letters were not opened. Once the briefcase arrived in Madrid, its contents became the focus of attention of <a href="Karl-Erich%20K%C3%BChlenthal">Karl-Erich Kühlenthal</a>, one of the most senior agents in Spain. He asked admiral <a href="Wilhelm%20Canaris">Wilhelm Canaris</a>, the head of the , to personally intervene and persuade the Spanish to surrender the documents. Acceding to the request, the Spanish removed the still-damp paper by tightly winding it around a probe into a cylindrical shape, and then pulling it out between the envelope flap – which was still closed by a wax seal – and the envelope body. The letters were dried and photographed, then soaked in salt water for 24 hours before being re-inserted into their envelopes, without the eyelash that had been planted there. The information was passed to the Germans on 8May. This was deemed so important by the agents in Spain that Kühlenthal personally took the documents to Germany.

On 11May the briefcase, complete with the documents, was returned to Haselden by the Spanish authorities; he forwarded it to London in the <a href="diplomatic%20bag">diplomatic bag</a>. On receipt the documents were forensically examined, and the missing eyelash noted. Further tests showed that the fibres in the paper had been damaged by folding more than once, which confirmed that the letters had been extracted and read. An additional test was made as the papers – still wet by the time they returned to London – were dried out: the folded paper dried into the rolled form it had when the Spaniards had extracted it from the envelope. To allay any potential German fears that their activities had been discovered, another pre-arranged encrypted but breakable cable was sent to Haselden stating that the envelopes had been examined and that they had not been opened; Haselden leaked the news to Spaniards known to be sympathetic to the Germans.

Final proof that the Germans had been passed the information from the letters came on 14May when a German communication was decrypted by the <a href="Ultra">Ultra</a> source of <a href="signals%20intelligence">signals intelligence</a> produced by the <a href="Government%20Communications%20Headquarters%23Government%20Code%20and%20Cypher%20School%20%28GC%26amp%3BCS%29">Government Code and Cypher School</a> (GC&CS) at <a href="Bletchley%20Park">Bletchley Park</a>. The message, which had been sent two days previously, warned that the invasion was to be in the Balkans, with a feint to the <a href="Dodecanese">Dodecanese</a>. A message was sent by Brigadier <a href="Leslie%20Hollis">Leslie Hollis</a> – the secretary to the <a href="Chiefs%20of%20Staff%20Committee">Chiefs of Staff Committee</a> – to Churchill, then in the United States. It read "Mincemeat swallowed rod, line and sinker by the right people and from the best information they look like acting on it."

Montagu continued the deception to reinforce the existence of Major Martin, and included his details in the published list of British casualties which appeared in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" on 4 June. By coincidence, also published that day were the names of two other officers who had died when their plane was lost at sea, and opposite the casualty listings was a report that the film star <a href="Leslie%20Howard%20%28actor%29">Leslie Howard</a> had been shot down by the <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> and died in the <a href="Bay%20of%20Biscay">Bay of Biscay</a>; both stories gave credence to the Major Martin story.

On 14 May 1943 Grand Admiral <a href="Karl%20D%C3%B6nitz">Karl Dönitz</a> met Hitler to discuss Dönitz's recent visit to Italy, his meeting with the Italian leader <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> and the progress of the war. The Admiral, referring to the Mincemeat documents as the "Anglo-Saxon order", recorded

Hitler informed Mussolini that Greece, <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a> and <a href="Corsica">Corsica</a> must be defended "at all costs", and that German troops would be best placed to do the job. He ordered that the experienced <a href="1st%20Panzer%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">1st Panzer Division</a> be transferred from France to <a href="Salonika">Salonika</a>. The order was intercepted by GC&CS on 21 May. By the end of June, German troop strength on Sardinia had been doubled to 10,000, with fighter aircraft also based there as support. Two panzer divisions were moved to the Balkans from the <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Eastern Front</a>; German torpedo boats were moved from Sicily to the Greek islands in preparation. Seven German divisions transferred to Greece, raising the number present to eight, and ten were posted to the Balkans, raising the number present to eighteen.

On 9 July the Allies invaded Sicily in Operation Husky. German signals intercepted by GC&CS showed that even four hours after the invasion of Sicily began, twenty-one aircraft left Sicily to reinforce Sardinia. For a considerable time after the initial invasion, Hitler was still convinced that an attack on the Balkans was imminent, and in late July he sent General <a href="Erwin%20Rommel">Erwin Rommel</a> to Salonika to prepare the defence of the region. By the time the German high command realised the mistake, it was too late to make a difference.

On 25 July 1943, as the battle for Sicily went against the Axis forces, the Italian <a href="Grand%20Council%20of%20Fascism">Grand Council of Fascism</a> voted <a href="25%20Luglio">to limit the power</a> of Mussolini, and handed control of the Italian armed forces over to King <a href="Victor%20Emmanuel%20III%20of%20Italy">Victor Emmanuel III</a>. The following day Mussolini met the King, who dismissed him as prime minister; the former dictator was then imprisoned. A new Italian government took power and began secret negotiations with the Allies. Sicily fell on 17August after a force of 65,000 Germans held off 400,000 American and British troops long enough to allow many of the Germans to evacuate to the Italian mainland.

The military historian <a href="Jon%20Latimer">Jon Latimer</a> observes that the relative ease with which the allies captured Sicily was not entirely because of Mincemeat, or the wider deception of Operation Barclay. Latimer identifies other factors, including Hitler's distrust of the Italians, and his unwillingness to risk German troops alongside Italian troops who may have been on the point of a general surrender. The military historian <a href="Michael%20Howard%20%28historian%29">Michael Howard</a>, while describing Mincemeat as "perhaps the most successful single deception operation of the entire war", considered Mincemeat and Barclay to have less impact on the course of the Sicily campaign than Hitler's "congenital obsession with the Balkans". Macintyre writes that the exact impact of Mincemeat is impossible to calculate. Although the British had expected 10,000 killed or wounded in the first week of fighting, only a seventh of that number became casualties; the navy expected 300 ships would be sunk in the action, but they lost 12. The predicted 90-day campaign was over in 38.

Smyth writes that as a result of Husky, Hitler suspended the Kursk offensive on 13July. This was partly because of the performance of the Soviet army, but partly because he still assumed that the Allied landing on Sicily was a feint that preceded the invasion in the Balkans, and he wanted to have troops available for fast deployment to meet them. Smyth observes that once Hitler gave up the initiative to the Soviets, he never regained it.

Montagu was appointed an <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> in 1944 for his part in Operation Mincemeat; for masterminding the plan, Cholmondeley was appointed a Member of the Order in 1948. <a href="Duff%20Cooper">Duff Cooper</a>, a former cabinet minister who had been briefed on the operation in March 1943, published the spy novel "Operation Heartbreak" (1950), which contained the plot device of a corpse – with papers naming him as William Maryngton – being floated off the coast of Spain with false documents to deceive the Germans. The British security services decided that the best response was to publish the story of Mincemeat. Over the course of a weekend Montagu wrote "The Man Who Never Was" (1953), which sold two million copies and formed the basis <a href="The%20Man%20Who%20Never%20Was">for a 1956 film</a>. The security services did not give Montagu complete freedom to reveal operational details, and he was careful not to mention the role played by signals intelligence to confirm that the operation had been successful. He was also careful to obscure "the idea of an organised programme of strategic deception ... with Mincemeat being presented as a 'wild' one-off caper". In 1977 Montagu published "Beyond Top Secret U", his wartime autobiography which gave further details of Mincemeat, among other operations.

A 1956 episode of "<a href="The%20Goon%20Show">The Goon Show</a>", entitled "The Man who Never Was", was set during the Second World War, and referred to a microfilm washed up on a beach inside a German boot. The play "Operation Mincemeat", written by <a href="Adrian%20Jackson%20%28Cardboard%20Citizens%29">Adrian Jackson</a> and Farhana Sheikh, was first staged by the <a href="Cardboard%20Citizens">Cardboard Citizens</a> theatre company in 2001. The work focused on Michael's homelessness. In his book "The Double Agents", the writer <a href="W.%20E.%20B.%20Griffin">W. E. B. Griffin</a> depicts Operation Mincemeat as an American operation run by the <a href="Office%20of%20Strategic%20Services">Office of Strategic Services</a>. Fictional characters are blended with Ian Fleming and the actors <a href="David%20Niven">David Niven</a> and <a href="Peter%20Ustinov">Peter Ustinov</a>.

In 1977 the <a href="Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission">Commonwealth War Graves Commission</a> took responsibility for Major Martin's grave in Huelva. In 1997 the Commission added the postscript "Glyndwr Michael served as Major William Martin RM".

Battle of Red Cliffs

The Battle of Red Cliffs, otherwise known as the Battle of Chibi, was a decisive battle fought at the <a href="end%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty">end of the Han dynasty</a>, about twelve years prior to the beginning of the <a href="Three%20Kingdoms">Three Kingdoms</a> period in <a href="History%20of%20China">Chinese history</a>. It was fought in the winter of AD 208/9 between the allied forces of the southern warlords <a href="Liu%20Bei">Liu Bei</a> and <a href="Sun%20Quan">Sun Quan</a> and the numerically superior forces of the northern warlord <a href="Cao%20Cao">Cao Cao</a>. Liu Bei and Sun Quan successfully frustrated Cao Cao's effort to conquer the land south of the <a href="Yangtze%20River">Yangtze River</a> and reunite the territory of the <a href="Eastern%20Han%20dynasty">Eastern Han dynasty</a>. The allied victory at Red Cliffs ensured the survival of Liu Bei and Sun Quan, gave them control of the Yangtze , and provided a line of defence that was the basis for the later creation of the two southern states of <a href="Shu%20Han">Shu Han</a> and <a href="Eastern%20Wu">Eastern Wu</a>. The battle has been called <a href="Largest%20naval%20battle%20in%20history">the largest naval battle in history</a> in terms of numbers involved.

Descriptions of the battle differ widely, and the location of the battle is fiercely debated . Although its precise location remains uncertain, the majority of academic conjectures place it on the south bank of the Yangtze River, southwest of present-day <a href="Wuhan">Wuhan</a> and northeast of Baqiu (present-day <a href="Yueyang">Yueyang</a>, <a href="Hunan">Hunan</a>).

By the early third century, the Han dynasty, which had ruled China for almost four centuries (albeit with a 16-year <a href="Wang%20Mang">interruption</a>, dividing the dynasty into its Western and Eastern periods), was crumbling. <a href="Emperor%20Xian%20of%20Han">Emperor Xian</a> had been a political figurehead since 189, with no control over the actions of the various warlords controlling their respective territories. One of the most powerful warlords in China was Cao Cao, who, by 207, had <a href="Cao%20Cao%27s%20unification%20of%20northern%20China">unified northern China</a> and retained total control of the <a href="North%20China%20Plain">North China Plain</a>. He then completed <a href="Battle%20of%20White%20Wolf%20Mountain">a successful campaign</a> against the <a href="Wuhuan">Wuhuan</a> in the winter of the same year, thus securing his northern frontier. Upon his return in 208, he was appointed <a href="Chancellor%20%28China%29">Chancellor</a>, a position that granted him absolute authority over the entire imperial government . Shortly afterwards, in the autumn of 208, his army began a southern campaign (; ).

The Yangtze River in the area of <a href="Jingzhou%20%28ancient%20China%29">Jing Province</a> (covering present-day <a href="Hubei">Hubei</a> and <a href="Hunan">Hunan</a> provinces) was key to the success of this strategy. If Cao Cao was to have any hope of reuniting the sundered Han empire, he had to achieve naval control of the middle Yangtze and command the strategic naval base at <a href="Jiangling%20County">Jiangling</a> as a means of access to the southern region . Two warlords controlled the regions of the Yangtze that were key to Cao Cao's success: <a href="Liu%20Biao">Liu Biao</a>, the Governor of Jing Province, controlled the area west of the mouth of the <a href="Han%20River%20%28Yangtze%20River%20tributary%29">Han River</a> (roughly encompassing the area around the city of <a href="Hankou%20District">Xiakou</a> and all territory south of that region), and Sun Quan, who controlled the river east of the Han and the southeastern territories abutting it . A third ally, Liu Bei, was living in refuge with Liu Biao at the garrison in <a href="Fancheng%20District">Fancheng</a> (in present-day <a href="Xiangyang">Xiangyang</a>), having fled from the northeast to Jing Province following a failed plot to assassinate Cao Cao and restore power to the imperial dynasty (; ).

The initial stages of the campaign were an unqualified success for Cao Cao, as the command of Jing Province had been substantially weakened and the Jing armies exhausted by conflict with Sun Quan to the south . Factions had arisen supporting either of Liu Biao's two sons in a struggle for succession. The younger son prevailed, and Liu Biao's dispossessed eldest son, <a href="Liu%20Qi%20%28Liu%20Biao%27s%20son%29">Liu Qi</a>, departed to assume a <a href="Commandery%20%28China%29">commandery</a> in Jiangxia (present-day <a href="Xinzhou%20District%2C%20Wuhan">Xinzhou District, Wuhan</a>, Hubei) . Liu Biao died of illness only a few weeks later, while Cao Cao was advancing from the north and, under these circumstances, Liu Biao's younger son and successor, <a href="Liu%20Cong%20%28Han%20dynasty%29">Liu Cong</a>, quickly surrendered. Cao Cao thus captured a sizeable fleet and secured the naval base at <a href="Jiangling%20County">Jiangling</a>. This provided him with a key strategic military depot and forward base to harbour his ships .

When Jing Province fell, Liu Bei quickly fled south, accompanied by a refugee population of civilians and soldiers. This disorganised exodus was pursued by Cao Cao's elite cavalry, and was surrounded and decisively beaten at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Changban">Battle of Changban</a> (near present-day <a href="Dangyang">Dangyang</a>, Hubei). Liu Bei escaped, however, and fled further east to Xiakou, where he liaised with Sun Quan's emissary <a href="Lu%20Su">Lu Su</a>. At this point historical accounts are inconsistent; Lu Su may have successfully encouraged Liu Bei to move even further east, to Fankou (樊口; around present-day <a href="Ezhou">Ezhou</a>, Hubei). In either case, Liu Bei was later joined by Liu Qi and levies from Jiangxia . Liu Bei's main advisor, <a href="Zhuge%20Liang">Zhuge Liang</a>, was sent to Chaisang (柴桑; in present-day <a href="Jiujiang">Jiujiang</a>, <a href="Jiangxi">Jiangxi</a>) to negotiate forming a mutual front against Cao Cao with Sun Quan .

By the time Zhuge Liang arrived, Cao Cao had already sent Sun Quan a letter boasting of commanding 800,000 men and hinting that he wanted Sun to surrender. The faction led by Sun Quan's Chief Clerk, <a href="Zhang%20Zhao">Zhang Zhao</a>, advocated surrender, citing Cao Cao's overwhelming numerical advantage. However, on separate occasions, Lu Su, Zhuge Liang, and Sun Quan's chief commander, Zhou Yu, all presented arguments to persuade Sun Quan to agree to the alliance against the northerners. Sun Quan finally decided upon war, chopping off a corner of his desk during an assembly and stating: "Anyone who still dares argue for surrender will be [treated] the same as this desk." He then assigned Zhou Yu, <a href="Cheng%20Pu">Cheng Pu</a>, and Lu Su with 30,000 men to aid Liu Bei against Cao Cao .

Although Cao Cao had boasted command of 800,000 men, Zhou Yu estimated Cao Cao's actual troop strength to be closer to 230,000. Furthermore, this total included 80,000 <a href="impressment">impressed</a> troops from the armies of the recently deceased Liu Biao, so the loyalty and morale of a large number of Cao Cao's force was uncertain . With the 20,000 soldiers that Liu Bei had gathered, the alliance consisted of approximately 50,000 marines who were trained and prepared for battle .

The Battle of Red Cliffs unfolded in three stages: an initial skirmish at Red Cliffs followed by a retreat to the Wulin (烏林) battlefields on the northwestern bank of the Yangtze, a decisive naval engagement, and Cao Cao's disastrous retreat along Huarong Road.

The combined Sun-Liu force sailed upstream from either Xiakou or Fankou to Red Cliffs, where they encountered Cao Cao's vanguard force. Plagued by disease and low morale due to the series of forced marches they had undertaken on the prolonged southern campaign , Cao Cao's men could not gain an advantage in the small skirmish which ensued, so Cao Cao retreated to Wulin (north of the Yangtze River) and the allies pulled back to the south .

Cao Cao had chained his ships from stem to stern, possibly aiming to reduce seasickness in his navy, which comprised mostly northerners who were not used to living on ships. Observing this, divisional commander <a href="Huang%20Gai">Huang Gai</a> sent Cao Cao a letter feigning surrender and prepared a squadron of <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>s described as "mengchong doujian" (蒙衝鬥艦). The ships had been converted into <a href="fire%20ship">fire ship</a>s by filling them with bundles of kindling, dry reeds, and fatty oil. As Huang Gai's "defecting" squadron approached the midpoint of the river, the sailors applied fire to the ships before taking to small boats. The unmanned fire ships, carried by the southeastern wind, sped towards Cao Cao's fleet and set it ablaze. A large number of men and horses either burned to death or drowned .

Following the initial shock, Zhou Yu and the allies led a lightly armed force to capitalise on the assault. The northern army was thrown into confusion and was utterly defeated. Seeing the situation was hopeless, Cao Cao then issued a general order of retreat and destroyed a number of his remaining ships before withdrawing .

Cao Cao's army attempted a retreat along Huarong Road, including a long stretch passing through marshlands north of <a href="Dongting%20Lake">Dongting Lake</a>. Heavy rains had made the road so treacherous that many of the sick soldiers had to carry bundles of grass on their backs and use them to fill the road to allow the horsemen to cross. Many of these soldiers drowned in the mud or were trampled to death in the effort. The allies, led by Zhou Yu and Liu Bei, gave chase over land and water until they reached Nan Commandery (南郡; present-day <a href="Jiangling%20County">Jiangling County</a>, <a href="Jingzhou">Jingzhou</a>, Hubei); combined with famine and disease, this decimated Cao Cao's remaining forces. Cao Cao then retreated north to his home base of <a href="Ye%20%28ancient%20China%29">Ye</a> (in present-day <a href="Handan">Handan</a>, <a href="Hebei">Hebei</a>), leaving <a href="Cao%20Ren">Cao Ren</a> and <a href="Xu%20Huang">Xu Huang</a> to guard Jiangling, <a href="Yue%20Jin">Yue Jin</a> stationed in <a href="Xiangzhou%20District%2C%20Xiangyang">Xiangyang</a>, and <a href="Man%20Chong">Man Chong</a> in Dangyang .

The allied counterattack might have vanquished Cao Cao and his forces entirely. However, the crossing of the Yangtze River dissolved into chaos as the allied armies converged on the riverbank and fought over the limited number of ferries. To restore order, a detachment led by Sun Quan's general <a href="Gan%20Ning">Gan Ning</a> established a bridgehead in <a href="Yichang">Yiling</a> to the north, and only a staunch rearguard action by Cao Ren prevented further catastrophe (; ).

A combination of Cao Cao's strategic errors and the effectiveness of Huang Gai's ruse had resulted in the allied victory at the Battle of Red Cliffs. Zhou Yu had previously observed that Cao Cao's generals and soldiers comprised mostly cavalry and infantry, and few had any experience in naval warfare. Cao Cao also had little support among the people of <a href="Jingzhou%20%28ancient%20China%29">Jing Province</a>, and thus lacked a secure forward base of operations . Despite the strategic acumen Cao Cao had displayed in earlier campaigns and battles, in this case he had simply assumed that numerical superiority would eventually defeat the Sun and Liu navy. Cao's first tactical mistake was converting his massive army of infantry and cavalry into a marine corps and navy: with only a few days of drills before the battle, Cao Cao's troops were ravaged by sea-sickness and lack of experience on water. Tropical diseases, to which the southerners were largely immune, were also rampant in Cao Cao's camps. Although numerous, Cao Cao's men were already exhausted by the unfamiliar environment and the extended southern campaign, as Zhuge Liang observed: "Even a powerful arrow at the end of its flight cannot penetrate a silk cloth" (<a href="%23Reference-Military%20Documents-1979">Military Documents 1979:193</a>).

A key advisor, <a href="Jia%20Xu">Jia Xu</a>, had recommended after the surrender of Liu Cong that the overtaxed armies be given time to rest and replenish before engaging the armies of Sun Quan and Liu Bei, but Cao Cao disregarded the advice . Cao Cao's own thoughts regarding his failure at Red Cliffs suggest that he held his own actions and misfortunes responsible for the defeat, rather than the strategies utilised by his enemy during the battle: "... it was only because of the sickness that I burnt my ships and retreated. It is out of all reason for Zhou Yu to take the credit for himself." .

By the end of 209, the post Cao Cao had established at Jiangling fell to Zhou Yu. The borders of the land under Cao Cao's control contracted about , to the area around <a href="Xiangzhou%20District%2C%20Xiangyang">Xiangyang</a> . Liu Bei, on the other hand, had gained territory by taking over the four commanderies (Wuling, Changsha, Lingling and Guiyang) south of the Yangtze River. Sun Quan's troops had suffered far greater casualties than Liu Bei's in the extended conflict against Cao Ren following the Battle of Red Cliffs , and the death of Zhou Yu in 210 resulted in a drastic weakening of Sun Quan's strength in <a href="Jingzhou%20%28ancient%20China%29">Jing Province</a> . Liu Bei also occupied Jing Province that Cao Cao had recently lost—a strategic and naturally fortified area on the Yangtze River that Sun Quan claimed for himself. The control of Jing Province provided Liu Bei with virtually unlimited access to the passage into <a href="Yi%20Province">Yi Province</a> (covering present-day <a href="Sichuan">Sichuan</a> and <a href="Chongqing">Chongqing</a>) and important waterways into <a href="Wu%20%28region%29">Wu</a> (southeastern China), as well as dominion of the southern Yangtze River.

Never again would Cao Cao command so large a fleet as he had at Jiangling, nor would a similar opportunity to destroy his southern rivals present itself again . The Battle of Red Cliffs and the capture of Jing Province by Liu Bei confirmed the separation of southern China from the northern heartland of the <a href="Yellow%20River">Yellow River</a> valley, and also foreshadowed a north-south axis of hostility that would resonate for centuries .

The precise location of the Red Cliffs battlefield has long been the subject of both popular and academic debates, but has never been conclusively established. Scholarly debates have continued for at least 1,350 years , and a number of arguments in favour of alternative sites have been put forward. There are clear grounds for rejecting at least some of these proposals, but four alternative locations are still advocated. According to , many of the current debates stem from the fact that the course and length of the Yangtze River between Wuli and Wuhan has changed since the <a href="Sui%20dynasty">Sui</a> and <a href="Tang%20dynasty">Tang</a> dynasties . The modern-day debate is also complicated by the fact that the names of some of the key locations have changed over the following centuries. For example, although modern Huarong city is located in Hunan, south of the Yangtze, in the 3rd century the city of that name was due east of Jiangling, considerably north of the Yangtze (; ). Moreover, one candidate site, Puqi (蒲圻), was renamed "<a href="Chibi%20City">Chibi City</a>" (赤壁市) in 1998 in a direct attempt to tie this location to the historical battlefield.

Historical records state that Cao Cao's forces retreated north across the Yangtze after the initial engagement at Red Cliffs, unequivocally placing the battle site on the south bank of the Yangtze. For this reason, a number of sites on the north bank have been discounted by historians and geographers. Historical accounts also establish east and west boundaries for a stretch of the Yangtze which encompasses all possible sites for the battlefield. The allied forces travelled upstream from either Fankou or Xiakou. Since the Yangtze flows roughly eastward towards the ocean (with northeast and southeast <a href="meander">meander</a>s), Red Cliffs must at least be west of Fankou, which is farther downstream. The westernmost boundary is also clear, since Cao Cao's eastern advance from Jiangling included passing Baqiu (present-day <a href="Yueyang">Yueyang</a>, <a href="Hunan">Hunan</a>) on the shore of <a href="Dongting%20Lake">Dongting Lake</a>. The battle must also have been downstream (northeast) of that location (; ).
One popular candidate for the battle site is Chibi Hill in <a href="Huangzhou">Huangzhou</a>, sometimes referred to as "<a href="Su%20Dongpo">Su Dongpo</a>'s Red Cliffs" or the "Literary Red Cliffs" (文赤壁). Support for this conjecture arises largely due to the famous 11th-century poem "<a href="First%20Ode%20on%20the%20Red%20Cliffs">First Rhapsody on the Red Cliffs</a>", which equates the Huangzhou Hill with the battlefield location. Excluding <a href="Tone%20%28linguistics%29">tone marks</a>, the <a href="pinyin">pinyin</a> romanization of this cliff's name is "Chibi", the same as the pinyin for Red Cliffs. However, the Chinese characters are completely different (赤鼻) as is their meaning ("Red Nose Hill"). This site is also on the north bank of the Yangtze, and is directly across from Fankou rather than upstream from it . Moreover, if the allied Sun-Liu forces left from Xiakou rather than Fankou, as the oldest historical sources suggest, then the hill in Huangzhou would have been "downstream" from the point of departure, a possibility which cannot be reconciled with historical sources.

Puqi, now named Chibi City, is perhaps the most widely accepted candidate. To differentiate from Su Dongpo's Red Cliffs, the site is also referred to as the "Military Red Cliffs" (武赤壁). It is directly across the Yangtze from Wulin. This argument was first proposed in the early Tang dynasty . There are also characters engraved in the cliffs (see image at the top of this page) suggesting that this is the site of the battle. The origin of the engraving can be dated to between the <a href="Tang%20dynasty">Tang</a> and <a href="Song%20dynasty">Song</a> dynasties, making it at least 1,000 years old .

Some sources mention the south banks of the Yangtze in Jiayu County (嘉鱼县) in the <a href="prefecture-level%20city">prefecture-level city</a> of <a href="Xianning">Xianning</a> in <a href="Hubei">Hubei</a> province as a possible location. This would place the battlefield downstream from Puqi (Chibi City), a view that is supported by scholars of <a href="History%20of%20China">Chinese history</a> such as <a href="Rafe%20de%20Crespigny">Rafe de Crespigny</a>, <a href="Wang%20Li%20%28scholar%29">Wang Li</a> and <a href="Zhu%20Dongrun">Zhu Dongrun</a>, following the <a href="Qing%20dynasty">Qing dynasty</a> historical document "<a href="Shui%20Jing%20Zhu">Shui Jing Zhu</a>" .

Another candidate is <a href="Wuhan">Wuhan</a>, which straddles the Yangtze at the confluence of the Yangtze and Han rivers. It is east of both Wulin (and Chibi City across the river) and Jiayu. This metropolis was incorporated by joining three cities. There is a local belief in Wuhan that the battle was fought at the junction of the rivers, southwest of the former <a href="Wuchang%20District">Wuchang</a> city, which is now part of Wuhan . asserts that the Chibi battlefield was one of a set of hills in Wuchang that were levelled in the 1930s so that their stone could be used as raw material. Citing several historical-geographical studies, shows that earlier accounts place the battlefield in Wuchang. Sheng Hongzhi's 5th-century "Jingzhou ji" in particular places the Chibi battlefield a distance of 160 <a href="Li%20%28unit%29">li</a> (approximately ) downstream from Wulin, but since the Paizhou and Luxikou meanders increased the length of the Yangtze River between Wuli and Wuchang by 100 <a href="Li%20%28unit%29">li</a> (approximately ; "see map") some time in the <a href="Sui%20dynasty">Sui</a> and <a href="Tang%20dynasty">Tang</a> dynasties , later works do not regard Wuchang as a possible site.

The romantic tradition that originated with the 14th-century historical novel "<a href="Romance%20of%20the%20Three%20Kingdoms">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</a>" differs from historical accounts in many details. For example, Cao Cao's army strength was exaggerated to over 830,000 men. This may be attributed to the ethos of later times, particularly of the Southern <a href="Song%20dynasty">Song dynasty</a> . The state of Shu Han, in particular, was viewed by later literati as the "legitimate" successor to the Han dynasty, so fictionalised accounts assign greater prominence than the historical records warrant to the roles of <a href="Liu%20Bei">Liu Bei</a>, <a href="Zhuge%20Liang">Zhuge Liang</a> and other heroes from Shu. This is generally accomplished by minimising the importance of Eastern Wu commanders and advisors such as Zhou Yu and Lu Su . While historical accounts describe Lu Su as a sensible advisor and Zhou Yu as an eminent military leader and "generous, sensible and courageous" man, "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" depicts Lu Su as unremarkable and Zhou Yu as cruel and cynical . Both are depicted as being inferior to Zhuge Liang in every respect .

The romances added wholly fictional and fantastical elements to the historical accounts and these were repeated in popular plays and operas. Examples from the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" include Zhuge Liang <a href="List%20of%20fictitious%20stories%20in%20Romance%20of%20the%20Three%20Kingdoms%23Zhuge%20Liang%20prays%20for%20the%20eastern%20wind">pretending to use magic to call forth favourable winds</a> (that he had in fact predicted by astronomical observation) for the fire ship attack, his strategy of "<a href="List%20of%20fictitious%20stories%20in%20Romance%20of%20the%20Three%20Kingdoms%23Borrowing%20arrows%20with%20straw%20boats">using straw boats to borrow arrows</a>", and <a href="List%20of%20fictitious%20stories%20in%20Romance%20of%20the%20Three%20Kingdoms%23Guan%20Yu%20releases%20Cao%20Cao%20at%20Huarong%20Trail">Guan Yu capturing and releasing Cao Cao at Huarong Trail</a>. The fictionalised accounts also name Zhuge Liang as a military commander in the combined forces, which is historically inaccurate .

Present-day <a href="Chibi%20City">Chibi City</a> in <a href="Hubei">Hubei</a> province was formerly named Puqi. In 1998, the <a href="State%20Council%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">Chinese State Council</a> approved the renaming of the city in celebration of the battle at Red Cliffs. Cultural festivals held by the city have dramatically increased tourism. (<a href="%23Reference-Xinhua-1997">Xinhua 1997</a>). In 1983, a statue of prominent <a href="Song%20dynasty">Song dynasty</a> poet, <a href="Su%20Shi">Su Shi</a>, was erected at the Huangzhou site of 'Su Dongpo's Red Cliffs' in tribute to his writings regarding Red Cliff (<a href="%23Reference-Xinhua-1983">Xinhua 1983</a>).
Video games based on the Three Kingdoms era (such as <a href="Koei">Koei</a>'s "<a href="Dynasty%20Warriors">Dynasty Warriors</a>" series, "<a href="Sangokushi%20Koumeiden">Sangokushi Koumeiden</a>", "<a href="Destiny%20of%20an%20Emperor">Destiny of an Emperor</a>" and "<a href="Kessen%20II">Kessen II</a>") have scenarios that include the battle.

Water fluoridation

Water fluoridation is the controlled addition of <a href="fluoride">fluoride</a> to a <a href="water%20supply">public water supply</a> to reduce <a href="tooth%20decay">tooth decay</a>. Fluoridated water contains fluoride at a level that is effective for preventing cavities; this can occur naturally or by adding fluoride. Fluoridated water operates on tooth surfaces: in the mouth, it creates low levels of fluoride in <a href="saliva">saliva</a>, which reduces the rate at which <a href="tooth%20enamel">tooth enamel</a> demineralizes and increases the rate at which it <a href="Remineralisation%20of%20teeth">remineralizes</a> in the early stages of cavities. Typically a fluoridated compound is added to <a href="drinking%20water">drinking water</a>, a process that in the U.S. costs an average of about $ per person-year. Defluoridation is needed when the naturally occurring fluoride level exceeds recommended limits. In 2011 the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> suggested a level of fluoride from 0.5 to 1.5 mg/L (milligrams per litre), depending on climate, local environment, and other sources of fluoride. <a href="Bottled%20water">Bottled water</a> typically has unknown fluoride levels.
Tooth decay remains a major <a href="public%20health">public health</a> concern in most <a href="industrialized%20countries">industrialized countries</a>, affecting 60–90% of schoolchildren and the vast majority of adults. Water fluoridation reduces cavities in children, while efficacy in adults is less clear. A <a href="Cochrane%20%28organisation%29">Cochrane</a> review estimates a reduction in cavities when water fluoridation was used by children who had no access to other sources of fluoride to be 35% in baby teeth and 26% in permanent teeth. The evidence quality was poor. Most European countries have experienced substantial declines in tooth decay without its use, however milk and salt fluoridation is widespread. Recent studies suggest that water fluoridation, particularly in industrialized nations, may be unnecessary because topical fluorides (such as in toothpaste) are widely used, and caries rates have become low.
Although fluoridation can cause <a href="dental%20fluorosis">dental fluorosis</a>, which can alter the appearance of <a href="Tooth%20development">developing teeth</a> or <a href="Tooth%20enamel">enamel fluorosis</a>, the differences are mild and usually not considered to be of aesthetic or public health concern. There is no clear evidence of other <a href="adverse%20effect">adverse effect</a>s from water fluoridation. Fluoride's effects depend on the total daily intake of fluoride from all sources. Drinking water is typically the largest source; other methods of <a href="fluoride%20therapy">fluoride therapy</a> include fluoridation of toothpaste, salt, and milk. The views on the most efficient method for community prevention of tooth decay are mixed. The Australian government states that water fluoridation is the most effective way to achieve fluoride exposure that is community-wide. The World Health Organization reports that water fluoridation, when feasible and culturally acceptable, has substantial advantages, especially for subgroups at high risk, while the <a href="European%20Commission">European Commission</a> finds no benefit to water fluoridation compared with topical use.
Public water fluoridation was first practiced in the U.S. As of 2012, 25 countries have artificial water fluoridation to varying degrees, 11 of them have more than 50% of their population drinking fluoridated water. A further 28 countries have water that is naturally fluoridated, though in many of them the fluoride is above the optimal level. As of 2012, about 435 million people worldwide received water fluoridated at the recommended level (i.e., about 5.4% of the global population). About 214 million of them living in the United States. Major health organizations such as the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> and <a href="FDI%20World%20Dental%20Federation">FDI World Dental Federation</a> supported water fluoridation as safe and effective. The <a href="Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> lists water fluoridation as one of the ten great public health achievements of the 20th century in the U.S. Despite this, the practice is controversial as a public health measure. Some countries and communities have discontinued fluoridation, while others have expanded it. Opponents of the practice argue that neither the benefits nor the risks have been studied adequately, and debate the conflict between what might be considered mass medication and individual liberties.

The goal of water fluoridation is to prevent tooth decay by adjusting the concentration of fluoride in public water supplies. Tooth decay (<a href="dental%20caries">dental caries</a>) is one of the most prevalent <a href="chronic%20diseases">chronic diseases</a> worldwide. Although it is rarely life-threatening, tooth decay can cause pain and impair eating, speaking, facial appearance, and acceptance into society, and it greatly affects the quality of life of children, particularly those of low <a href="socioeconomic%20status">socioeconomic status</a>. In most <a href="industrialized%20countries">industrialized countries</a>, tooth decay affects 60–90% of schoolchildren and the vast majority of adults; although the problem appears to be less in Africa's developing countries, it is expected to increase in several countries there because of changing diet and inadequate fluoride exposure. In the U.S., minorities and the poor both have higher rates of decayed and missing teeth, and their children have less dental care. Once a cavity occurs, the tooth's fate is that of repeated restorations, with estimates for the median life of an <a href="Amalgam%20%28dentistry%29">amalgam</a> <a href="tooth%20filling">tooth filling</a> ranging from 9 to 14 years. Oral disease is the fourth most expensive disease to treat. The motivation for fluoridation of salt or water is similar to that of <a href="iodized%20salt">iodized salt</a> for the prevention of <a href="congenital%20hypothyroidism">congenital hypothyroidism</a> and <a href="goiter">goiter</a>.

The goal of water fluoridation is to prevent a chronic disease whose burdens particularly fall on children and the poor. Another of the goals was to bridge inequalities in dental health and <a href="Dentistry">dental care</a>. Some studies suggest that fluoridation reduces oral health <a href="Economic%20inequality">inequalities between the rich and poor</a>, but the evidence is limited. There is anecdotal but not scientific evidence that fluoride allows more time for dental treatment by slowing the progression of tooth decay, and that it simplifies treatment by causing most cavities to occur in <a href="Dental%20caries%23Pit%20and%20fissure%20caries">pits and fissures of teeth</a>. Other reviews have found not enough evidence to determine if water fluoridation reduces oral-health social disparities.

Health and dental organizations worldwide have endorsed its safety and effectiveness. Its use began in 1945, following studies of children in a region where higher levels of fluoride occur naturally in the water. Further research showed that moderate fluoridation prevents tooth decay.

Fluoridation does not affect the appearance, taste, or smell of drinking water. It is normally accomplished by adding one of three compounds to the water: sodium fluoride, fluorosilicic acid, or sodium fluorosilicate.

These compounds were chosen for their <a href="solubility">solubility</a>, safety, availability, and low cost. A 1992 census found that, for U.S. public water supply systems reporting the type of compound used, 63% of the population received water fluoridated with fluorosilicic acid, 28% with sodium fluorosilicate, and 9% with sodium fluoride.

The <a href="Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> developed recommendations for water fluoridation that specify requirements for personnel, reporting, training, inspection, monitoring, surveillance, and actions in case of overfeed, along with technical requirements for each major compound used.

Although fluoride was once considered an <a href="essential%20nutrient">essential nutrient</a>, the <a href="U.S.%20National%20Research%20Council">U.S. National Research Council</a> has since removed this designation due to the lack of studies showing it is essential for human growth, though still considering fluoride a "beneficial element" due to its positive impact on oral health. The <a href="European%20Food%20Safety%20Authority">European Food Safety Authority</a>'s Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) considers fluoride not to be an essential nutrient, yet, due to the beneficial effects of dietary fluoride on prevention of dental caries they have defined an <a href="Dietary%20Reference%20Intake">Adequate Intake</a> (AI) value for it. The AI of fluoride from all sources (including non-dietary sources) is 0.05 mg/kg body weight per day for both children and adults, including pregnant and lactating women.

In 2011, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lowered the recommended level of fluoride to 0.7 mg/L. In 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), based on the recommendation of the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) for fluoridation of community water systems, recommended that bottled water manufacturers limit fluoride in bottled water to no more than 0.7 milligrams per liter (mg/L)(milligrams per liter, equivalent to <a href="parts%20per%20million">parts per million</a>).

Previous recommendations were based on evaluations from 1962, when the U.S. specified the optimal level of fluoride to range from 0.7 to 1.2 mg/L (milligrams per liter, equivalent to parts per million), depending on the average maximum daily air temperature; the optimal level is lower in warmer climates, where people drink more water, and is higher in cooler climates.

These standards are not appropriate for all parts of the world, where fluoride levels might be excessive and fluoride should be removed from water, and is based on assumptions that have become obsolete with the rise of <a href="air%20conditioning">air conditioning</a> and increased use of <a href="soft%20drinks">soft drinks</a>, <a href="processed%20food">processed food</a>, <a href="Toothpaste%23Fluorides">fluoridated toothpaste</a>, and other sources of fluorides. In 2011 the World Health Organization stated that 1.5 mg/L should be an absolute upper bound and that 0.5 mg/L may be an appropriate lower limit. A 2007 Australian systematic review recommended a range from 0.6 to 1.1 mg/L.

Fluoride naturally occurring in water can be above, at, or below recommended levels. Rivers and lakes generally contain fluoride levels less than 0.5 mg/L, but groundwater, particularly in volcanic or mountainous areas, can contain as much as 50 mg/L. Higher concentrations of <a href="fluorine">fluorine</a> are found in <a href="alkaline">alkaline</a> <a href="Volcanic%20rock">volcanic</a>, <a href="Hydrothermal%20circulation%23Hydrothermal%20ore%20deposits">hydrothermal</a>, <a href="sedimentary">sedimentary</a>, and other <a href="Rock%20%28geology%29">rocks</a> derived from highly evolved <a href="magma">magma</a>s and <a href="Ore%20genesis%23Hydrothermal%20processes">hydrothermal solutions</a>, and this fluorine <a href="Solvation">dissolves</a> into nearby water as fluoride. In most drinking waters, over 95% of total fluoride is the F <a href="ion">ion</a>, with the <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>–fluoride <a href="Complex%20%28chemistry%29">complex</a> (MgF) being the next most common. Because fluoride levels in water are usually controlled by the solubility of <a href="fluorite">fluorite</a> (CaF), high natural fluoride levels are associated with <a href="calcium">calcium</a>-deficient, alkaline, and <a href="soft%20water">soft water</a>s. Defluoridation is needed when the naturally occurring fluoride level exceeds recommended limits. It can be accomplished by <a href="percolating">percolating</a> water through granular beds of <a href="activated%20alumina">activated alumina</a>, <a href="bone%20meal">bone meal</a>, <a href="bone%20char">bone char</a>, or <a href="tricalcium%20phosphate">tricalcium phosphate</a>; by coagulation with <a href="alum">alum</a>; or by <a href="Precipitation%20%28chemistry%29">precipitation</a> with <a href="Lime%20%28mineral%29">lime</a>.

<a href="Pitcher%20%28container%29">Pitcher</a> or <a href="faucet">faucet</a>-mounted water filters do not alter fluoride content; the more-expensive <a href="reverse%20osmosis">reverse osmosis</a> filters remove 65–95% of fluoride, and <a href="distillation">distillation</a> removes all fluoride. Some bottled waters contain undeclared fluoride, which can be present naturally in source waters, or if water is sourced from a <a href="tap%20water">public supply</a> which has been fluoridated. The FDA states that bottled water products labeled as de-ionized, purified, demineralized, or distilled have been treated in such a way that they contain no or only trace amounts of fluoride, unless they specifically list fluoride as an added ingredient.

Existing <a href="Evidence-based%20medicine">evidence</a> suggests that water fluoridation reduces tooth decay. Consistent evidence also suggests that it causes <a href="dental%20fluorosis">dental fluorosis</a>, most of which is mild and not usually of aesthetic concern. No clear evidence of other adverse effects exists, though almost all research thereof has been of poor quality.

Reviews have shown that water fluoridation reduces cavities in children. A conclusion for the efficacy in adults is less clear with some reviews finding benefit and others not. Studies in the U.S. in the 1950s and 1960s showed that water fluoridation reduced childhood cavities by fifty to sixty percent, while studies in 1989 and 1990 showed lower reductions (40% and 18% respectively), likely due to increasing use of fluoride from other sources, notably toothpaste, and also the 'halo effect' of food and drink that is made in fluoridated areas and consumed in unfluoridated ones.

A 2000 UK <a href="systematic%20review">systematic review</a> (York) found that water fluoridation was <a href="Association%20%28statistics%29">associated</a> with a decreased proportion of children with cavities of 15% and with a decrease in decayed, <a href="Tooth%20loss">missing</a>, and <a href="Dental%20restoration">filled</a> <a href="primary%20teeth">primary teeth</a> (average decreases was 2.25 teeth). The review found that the evidence was of moderate quality: few studies attempted to reduce <a href="observer%20bias">observer bias</a>, control for <a href="confounding%20factor">confounding factor</a>s, report variance measures, or use appropriate analysis. Although no major differences between natural and artificial fluoridation were apparent, the evidence was inadequate for a conclusion about any differences. A 2007 Australian systematic review used the same inclusion criteria as York's, plus one additional study. This did not affect the York conclusions. A 2011 European Commission systematic review based its efficacy on York's review conclusion. A 2015 <a href="Cochrane%20%28organisation%29">Cochrane</a> systematic review estimated a reduction in cavities when water fluoridation was used by children who had no access to other sources of fluoride to be 35% in baby teeth and 26% in permanent teeth. The evidence was of poor quality.

Fluoride may also prevent cavities in adults of all ages. A 2007 <a href="meta-analysis">meta-analysis</a> by CDC researchers found that water fluoridation prevented an estimated 27% of cavities in adults, about the same fraction as prevented by exposure to any delivery method of fluoride (29% average). A 2011 European Commission review found that the benefits of water fluoridation for adult in terms of reductions in decay are limited. A 2015 Cochrane review found no conclusive research regarding the effectiveness of water fluoridation in adults. A 2016 review found variable quality evidence that, overall, stopping of community water fluoridation programs was typically followed by an increase in cavities.

Most countries in Europe have experienced substantial declines in cavities without the use of water fluoridation due to the introduction of fluoridated toothpaste and the large use of other fluoride-containing products, including mouthrinse, dietary supplements, and professionally applied or prescribed gel, foam, or varnish. For example, in Finland and Germany, tooth decay rates remained stable or continued to decline after water fluoridation stopped in communities with widespread fluoride exposure from other sources. Fluoridation is however still clearly necessary in the U.S. because unlike most European countries, the U.S. does not have school-based dental care, many children do not visit a dentist regularly, and for many U.S. children water fluoridation is the prime source of exposure to fluoride. The effectiveness of water fluoridation can vary according to circumstances such as whether preventive dental care is free to all children.

Fluoride's adverse effects depend on total fluoride dosage from all sources. At the commonly recommended dosage, the only clear adverse effect is <a href="dental%20fluorosis">dental fluorosis</a>, which can alter the appearance of children's teeth during <a href="tooth%20development">tooth development</a>; this is mostly mild and is unlikely to represent any real effect on aesthetic appearance or on public health. In April 2015, recommended fluoride levels in the United States were changed to 0.7 ppm from 0.7–1.2 ppm to reduce the risk of dental fluorosis. The 2015 Cochrane review estimated that for a ﬂuoride level of 0.7 ppm the percentage of participants with ﬂuorosis of aesthetic concern was approximately 12%. This increases to 40% when considering ﬂuorosis of any level not of aesthetic concern. In the US mild or very mild dental fluorosis has been reported in 20% of the population, moderate fluorosis in 2% and severe fluorosis in less than 1%.

The critical period of exposure is between ages one and four years, with the risk ending around age eight. Fluorosis can be prevented by monitoring all sources of fluoride, with fluoridated water directly or indirectly responsible for an estimated 40% of risk and other sources, notably toothpaste, responsible for the remaining 60%. Compared to water naturally fluoridated at 0.4 mg/L, fluoridation to 1 mg/L is estimated to cause additional fluorosis in one of every 6 people (95% CI 4–21 people), and to cause additional fluorosis of aesthetic concern in one of every 22 people (95% CI 13.6–∞ people). Here, "aesthetic concern" is a term used in a standardized scale based on what adolescents would find unacceptable, as measured by a 1996 study of British 14-year-olds. In many industrialized countries the <a href="prevalence">prevalence</a> of fluorosis is increasing even in unfluoridated communities, mostly because of fluoride from swallowed toothpaste. A 2009 systematic review indicated that fluorosis is associated with consumption of <a href="infant%20formula">infant formula</a> or of water added to reconstitute the formula, that the evidence was distorted by <a href="publication%20bias">publication bias</a>, and that the evidence that the formula's fluoride caused the fluorosis was weak. In the U.S. the decline in tooth decay was accompanied by increased fluorosis in both fluoridated and unfluoridated communities; accordingly, fluoride has been reduced in various ways worldwide in infant formulas, children's toothpaste, water, and fluoride-supplement schedules.

Fluoridation has little effect on risk of <a href="bone%20fracture">bone fracture</a> (broken bones); it may result in slightly lower fracture risk than either excessively high levels of fluoridation or no fluoridation. There is no clear association between fluoridation and <a href="cancer">cancer</a> or deaths due to cancer, both for cancer in general and also specifically for <a href="bone%20cancer">bone cancer</a> and <a href="osteosarcoma">osteosarcoma</a>. Other adverse effects lack sufficient evidence to reach a confident conclusion.

Fluoride can occur naturally in water in concentrations well above recommended levels, which can have <a href="Fluoride%20poisoning%23Chronic%20toxicity">several long-term adverse effects</a>, including severe <a href="dental%20fluorosis">dental fluorosis</a>, <a href="skeletal%20fluorosis">skeletal fluorosis</a>, and weakened bones; water utilities in the developed world reduce fluoride levels to <a href="maximum%20contaminant%20level">regulated maximum levels</a> in regions where natural levels are high, and the WHO and other groups work with countries and regions in the developing world with naturally excessive fluoride levels to achieve safe levels. The World Health Organization recommends a guideline maximum fluoride value of 1.5 mg/L as a level at which fluorosis should be minimal.

In rare cases improper implementation of water fluoridation can result in overfluoridation that causes outbreaks of acute <a href="fluoride%20poisoning">fluoride poisoning</a>, with symptoms that include <a href="nausea">nausea</a>, <a href="vomiting">vomiting</a>, and <a href="diarrhea">diarrhea</a>. Three such outbreaks were reported in the U.S. between 1991 and 1998, caused by fluoride concentrations as high as 220 mg/L; in the 1992 Alaska outbreak, 262 people became ill and one person died. In 2010, approximately 60 gallons of fluoride were released into the water supply in <a href="Asheboro%2C%20North%20Carolina">Asheboro, North Carolina</a> in 90 minutes—an amount that was intended to be released in a 24-hour period.

Like other common water additives such as <a href="water%20chlorination">chlorine</a>, hydrofluosilicic acid and sodium silicofluoride decrease pH and cause a small increase of <a href="corrosivity">corrosivity</a>, but this problem is easily addressed by increasing the pH. Although it has been hypothesized that hydrofluosilicic acid and sodium silicofluoride might increase human <a href="lead">lead</a> uptake from water, a 2006 statistical analysis did not support concerns that these chemicals cause higher blood lead concentrations in children. Trace levels of <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a> and lead may be present in fluoride compounds added to water, but no credible evidence exists that their presence is of concern: <a href="concentration">concentration</a>s are below measurement limits.

The effect of water fluoridation on the natural environment has been investigated, and no adverse effects have been established. Issues studied have included fluoride concentrations in groundwater and downstream rivers; lawns, gardens, and plants; consumption of plants grown in fluoridated water; air emissions; and equipment noise.

Fluoride exerts its major effect by interfering with the demineralization mechanism of tooth decay. Tooth decay is an <a href="infectious%20disease">infectious disease</a>, the key feature of which is an increase within <a href="dental%20plaque">dental plaque</a> of bacteria such as "<a href="Streptococcus%20mutans">Streptococcus mutans</a>" and "<a href="Lactobacillus">Lactobacillus</a>". These produce organic acids when carbohydrates, especially sugar, are eaten. When enough acid is produced to lower the <a href="pH">pH</a> below 5.5, the acid dissolves <a href="carbonate">carbonate</a>d <a href="hydroxyapatite">hydroxyapatite</a>, the main component of tooth enamel, in a process known as "demineralization". After the sugar is gone, some of the mineral loss can be recovered—or "<a href="Remineralisation%20of%20teeth">remineralized</a>"—from ions dissolved in the saliva. Cavities result when the rate of demineralization exceeds the rate of remineralization, typically in a process that requires many months or years.
All fluoridation methods, including water fluoridation, create low levels of fluoride ions in saliva and plaque fluid, thus exerting a <a href="topical">topical</a> or surface effect. A person living in an area with fluoridated water may experience rises of fluoride concentration in saliva to about 0.04 mg/L several times during a day. Technically, this fluoride does not prevent cavities but rather controls the rate at which they develop. When fluoride ions are present in plaque fluid along with dissolved hydroxyapatite, and the pH is higher than 4.5, a <a href="fluorapatite">fluorapatite</a>-like remineralized <a href="Veneer%20%28dentistry%29">veneer</a> is formed over the remaining surface of the enamel; this veneer is much more acid-resistant than the original hydroxyapatite, and is formed more quickly than ordinary remineralized enamel would be. The cavity-prevention effect of fluoride is mostly due to these surface effects, which occur during and after <a href="tooth%20eruption">tooth eruption</a>. Although some systemic (whole-body) fluoride returns to the saliva via <a href="blood%20plasma">blood plasma</a>, and to unerupted teeth via plasma or crypt fluid, there is little data to determine what percentages of fluoride's anticavity effect comes from these systemic mechanisms. Also, although fluoride affects the physiology of <a href="dental%20bacteria">dental bacteria</a>, its effect on <a href="bacterial%20growth">bacterial growth</a> does not seem to be relevant to cavity prevention.

Fluoride's effects depend on the total daily intake of fluoride from all sources. About 70–90% of <a href="ingested">ingested</a> fluoride is <a href="Absorption%20%28pharmacokinetics%29">absorbed</a> into the blood, where it distributes throughout the body. In infants 80–90% of absorbed fluoride is retained, with the rest <a href="excreted">excreted</a>, mostly via <a href="urine">urine</a>; in adults about 60% is retained. About 99% of retained fluoride is stored in bone, teeth, and other calcium-rich areas, where excess quantities can cause fluorosis. Drinking water is typically the largest source of fluoride. In many industrialized countries swallowed toothpaste is the main source of fluoride exposure in unfluoridated communities. Other sources include dental products other than toothpaste; air pollution from fluoride-containing <a href="coal">coal</a> or from phosphate fertilizers; <a href="trona">trona</a>, used to tenderize meat in <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>; and tea leaves, particularly the <a href="tea%20brick">tea brick</a>s favored in parts of China. High fluoride levels have been found in other foods, including barley, cassava, corn, rice, taro, yams, and fish protein concentrate. The U.S. <a href="Institute%20of%20Medicine">Institute of Medicine</a> has established <a href="Dietary%20Reference%20Intake">Dietary Reference Intake</a>s for fluoride: Adequate Intake values range from 0.01 mg/day for infants aged 6 months or less, to 4 mg/day for men aged 19 years and up; and the Tolerable Upper Intake Level is 0.10 mg/kg/day for infants and children through age 8 years, and 10 mg/day thereafter. A rough estimate is that an adult in a temperate climate consumes 0.6 mg/day of fluoride without fluoridation, and 2 mg/day with fluoridation. However, these values differ greatly among the world's regions: for example, in <a href="Sichuan%2C%20China">Sichuan, China</a> the average daily fluoride intake is only 0.1 mg/day in drinking water but 8.9 mg/day in food and 0.7 mg/day directly from the air due to the use of high-fluoride soft coal for cooking and drying foodstuffs indoors.

The views on the most effective method for community prevention of tooth decay are mixed. The Australian government review states that water fluoridation is the most effective means of achieving fluoride exposure that is community-wide. The <a href="European%20Commission">European Commission</a> review states "No obvious advantage appears in favour of water fluoridation compared with topical prevention". Other <a href="fluoride%20therapies">fluoride therapies</a> are also effective in preventing tooth decay; they include fluoride toothpaste, <a href="mouthwash">mouthwash</a>, gel, and <a href="Fluoride%20varnish">varnish</a>, and fluoridation of salt and milk. <a href="Dental%20sealant">Dental sealant</a>s are effective as well, with estimates of prevented cavities ranging from 33% to 86%, depending on age of sealant and type of study.

Fluoride <a href="toothpaste">toothpaste</a> is the most widely used and rigorously evaluated fluoride treatment. Its introduction is considered the main reason for the decline in tooth decay in <a href="industrialized%20countries">industrialized countries</a>, and toothpaste appears to be the single common factor in countries where tooth decay has declined. Toothpaste is the only realistic fluoride strategy in many low-income countries, where lack of infrastructure renders water or salt fluoridation infeasible. It relies on individual and family behavior, and its use is less likely among lower economic classes; in low-income countries it is unaffordable for the poor. Fluoride toothpaste prevents about 25% of cavities in young permanent teeth, and its effectiveness is improved if higher concentrations of fluoride are used, or if the toothbrushing is supervised. Fluoride mouthwash and gel are about as effective as fluoride toothpaste; fluoride varnish prevents about 45% of cavities. By comparison, brushing with a nonfluoride toothpaste has little effect on cavities.

The effectiveness of <a href="salt">salt</a> fluoridation is about the same as that of water fluoridation, if most salt for human consumption is fluoridated. Fluoridated salt reaches the consumer in salt at home, in meals at school and at large kitchens, and in bread. For example, Jamaica has just one salt producer, but a complex public water supply; it started fluoridating all salt in 1987, achieving a decline in cavities. Universal salt fluoridation is also practiced in Colombia and the Swiss <a href="Canton%20of%20Vaud">Canton of Vaud</a>; in Germany fluoridated salt is widely used in households but unfluoridated salt is also available, giving consumers a choice. Concentrations of fluoride in salt range from 90 to 350 mg/kg, with studies suggesting an optimal concentration of around 250 mg/kg.

<a href="Milk">Milk</a> fluoridation is practiced by the Borrow Foundation in some parts of Bulgaria, Chile, Peru, Russia, Macedonia, Thailand and the UK. Depending on location, the fluoride is added to milk, to <a href="powdered%20milk">powdered milk</a>, or to <a href="yogurt">yogurt</a>. For example, milk powder fluoridation is used in rural Chilean areas where water fluoridation is not technically feasible. These programs are aimed at children, and have neither targeted nor been evaluated for adults. A systematic review found low-quality evidence to support the practice, but also concluded that further studies were needed.

Other public-health strategies to control tooth decay, such as education to change behavior and diet, have lacked impressive results. Although fluoride is the only well-documented agent which controls the rate at which cavities develop, it has been suggested that adding <a href="calcium">calcium</a> to the water would reduce cavities further. Other agents to prevent tooth decay include antibacterials such as <a href="chlorhexidine">chlorhexidine</a> and sugar substitutes such as <a href="xylitol">xylitol</a>. Xylitol-sweetened <a href="chewing%20gum">chewing gum</a> has been recommended as a supplement to fluoride and other conventional treatments if the gum is not too costly. Two proposed approaches, bacteria replacement therapy (<a href="probiotics">probiotics</a>) and <a href="caries%20vaccine">caries vaccine</a>, would share water fluoridation's advantage of requiring only minimal patient compliance, but have not been proven safe and effective. Other experimental approaches include fluoridated sugar, <a href="health%20effects%20of%20polyphenols">polyphenols</a>, and <a href="Recaldent">casein phosphopeptide–amorphous calcium phosphate nanocomplexes</a>.

A 2007 Australian review concluded that water fluoridation is the most effective and socially the most equitable way to expose entire communities to fluoride's cavity-prevention effects. A 2002 U.S. review estimated that sealants decreased cavities by about 60% overall, compared to about 18–50% for fluoride. A 2007 Italian review suggested that water fluoridation may not be needed, particularly in the industrialized countries where cavities have become rare, and concluded that toothpaste and other topical fluoride are the best way to prevent cavities worldwide. A 2004 World Health Organization review stated that water fluoridation, when it is culturally acceptable and technically feasible, has substantial advantages in preventing tooth decay, especially for subgroups at high risk.

As of November 2012, a total of about 378 million people worldwide received artificially fluoridated water. The majority of those were in the United States. About 40 million worldwide received water that was naturally fluoridated to recommended levels.

Much of the early work on establishing the connection between fluoride and dental health was performed by scientists in the U.S. during the early 20th century, and the U.S. was the first country to implement public water fluoridation on a wide scale. It has been introduced to varying degrees in many countries and territories outside the U.S., including Argentina, <a href="Water%20fluoridation%20in%20Australia">Australia</a>, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Serbia, Singapore, Spain, the UK, and Vietnam. In 2004, an estimated 13.7 million people in western Europe and 194 million in the U.S. received artificially fluoridated water. In 2010, about 66% of the U.S. population was receiving fluoridated water.

Naturally fluoridated water is used by approximately 4% of the world's population, in countries including Argentina, France, Gabon, Libya, Mexico, Senegal, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, the U.S., and Zimbabwe. In some locations, notably parts of Africa, China, and India, natural fluoridation exceeds recommended levels.

Communities have discontinued water fluoridation in some countries, including Finland, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. On 26 August 2014, Israel stopped mandating fluoridation, stating "Only some 1% of the water is used for drinking, while 99% of the water is intended for other uses (industry, agriculture, flushing toilets etc.). There is also scientific evidence that fluoride in large amounts can lead to damage to health. When fluoride is supplied via drinking water, there is no control regarding the amount of fluoride actually consumed, which could lead to excessive consumption. Supply of fluoridated water forces those who do not so wish to also consume water with added fluoride. This approach is therefore not accepted in most countries in the world." This change was often motivated by political opposition to water fluoridation, but sometimes the need for water fluoridation was met by alternative strategies. The use of fluoride in its various forms is the foundation of tooth decay prevention throughout Europe; several countries have introduced fluoridated salt, with varying success: in Switzerland and Germany, fluoridated salt represents 65% to 70% of the domestic market, while in France the market share reached 60% in 1993 but dwindled to 14% in 2009; Spain, in 1986 the second West European country to introduce fluoridation of table salt, reported a market share in 2006 of only 10%. In three other West European countries, Greece, Austria and the Netherlands, the legal framework for production and marketing of fluoridated edible salt exists. At least six Central European countries (Hungary, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Croatia, Slovenia, Romania) have shown some interest in salt fluoridation; however, significant usage of approximately 35% was only achieved in the Czech Republic. The Slovak Republic had the equipment to treat salt by 2005; in the other four countries attempts to introduce fluoridated salt were not successful.

The history of water fluoridation can be divided into three periods. The first () was research into the cause of a form of mottled tooth enamel called the Colorado brown stain. The second (c. 1933–1945) focused on the relationship between fluoride concentrations, fluorosis, and tooth decay, and established that moderate levels of fluoride prevent cavities. The third period, from 1945 on, focused on adding fluoride to community water supplies.

In the first half of the 19th century, investigators established that fluoride occurs with varying concentrations in teeth, bone, and drinking water. In the second half they speculated that fluoride would protect against tooth decay, proposed supplementing the diet with fluoride, and observed mottled enamel (now called severe <a href="dental%20fluorosis">dental fluorosis</a>) without knowing the cause. In 1874, the German public health officer Carl Wilhelm Eugen Erhardt recommended <a href="potassium%20fluoride">potassium fluoride</a> supplements to preserve teeth. In 1892 the British physician <a href="James%20Crichton-Browne">James Crichton-Browne</a> noted in an address that fluoride's absence from diets had resulted in teeth that were "peculiarly liable to decay", and who proposed "the reintroduction into our diet ... of fluorine in some suitable natural form ... to fortify the teeth of the next generation".

The foundation of water fluoridation in the U.S. was the research of the dentist Frederick McKay (1874–1959). McKay spent thirty years investigating the cause of what was then known as the Colorado brown stain, which produced mottled but also cavity-free teeth; with the help of <a href="G.V.%20Black">G.V. Black</a> and other researchers, he established that the cause was fluoride. The first report of a statistical association between the stain and lack of tooth decay was made by UK dentist Norman Ainsworth in 1925. In 1931, an <a href="Alcoa">Alcoa</a> chemist, H.V. Churchill, concerned about a possible link between <a href="aluminum">aluminum</a> and staining, analyzed water from several areas where the staining was common and found that fluoride was the common factor.

In the 1930s and early 1940s, <a href="H.%20Trendley%20Dean">H. Trendley Dean</a> and colleagues at the newly created <a href="U.S.%20National%20Institutes%20of%20Health">U.S. National Institutes of Health</a> published several <a href="epidemiological">epidemiological</a> studies suggesting that a fluoride concentration of about 1 mg/L was associated with substantially fewer cavities in temperate climates, and that it increased fluorosis but only to a level that was of no medical or aesthetic concern. Other studies found no other significant adverse effects even in areas with fluoride levels as high as 8 mg/L. To test the hypothesis that adding fluoride would prevent cavities, Dean and his colleagues conducted a <a href="controlled%20experiment">controlled experiment</a> by fluoridating the water in <a href="Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan">Grand Rapids, Michigan</a>, starting 25 January 1945. The results, published in 1950, showed significant reduction of cavities. Significant reductions in tooth decay were also reported by important early studies outside the U.S., including the Brantford–Sarnia–Stratford study in Canada (1945–1962), the Tiel–Culemborg study in the Netherlands (1953–1969), the Hastings study in New Zealand (1954–1970), and the Department of Health study in the U.K. (1955–1960). By present-day standards these and other pioneering studies were crude, but the large reductions in cavities convinced public health professionals of the benefits of fluoridation.

Fluoridation became an official policy of the <a href="U.S.%20Public%20Health%20Service">U.S. Public Health Service</a> by 1951, and by 1960 water fluoridation had become widely used in the U.S., reaching about 50 million people. By 2006, 69.2% of the U.S. population on public water systems were receiving fluoridated water, amounting to 61.5% of the total U.S. population; 3.0% of the population on public water systems were receiving naturally occurring fluoride. In some other countries the pattern was similar. New Zealand, which led the world in per-capita sugar consumption and had the world's worst teeth, began fluoridation in 1953, and by 1968 fluoridation was used by 65% of the population served by a piped water supply. Fluoridation was introduced into Brazil in 1953, was regulated by federal law starting in 1974, and by 2004 was used by 71% of the population. In the Republic of Ireland, fluoridation was legislated in 1960, and after a constitutional challenge the two major cities of Dublin and Cork began it in 1964; fluoridation became required for all sizeable public water systems and by 1996 reached 66% of the population. In other locations, fluoridation was used and then discontinued: in <a href="Kuopio">Kuopio</a>, Finland, fluoridation was used for decades but was discontinued because the school dental service provided significant fluoride programs and the cavity risk was low, and in <a href="Basel">Basel</a>, Switzerland, it was replaced with fluoridated salt.

McKay's work had established that fluorosis occurred before <a href="tooth%20eruption">tooth eruption</a>. Dean and his colleagues assumed that fluoride's protection against cavities was also pre-eruptive, and this incorrect assumption was accepted for years. By 2000, however, the <a href="topical">topical</a> effects of fluoride (in both water and toothpaste) were well understood, and it had become known that a constant low level of fluoride in the mouth works best to prevent cavities.

Fluoridation costs an estimated $ per person-year on the average (range: $–$; all costs in this paragraph are for the U.S. and are in dollars, inflation-adjusted from earlier estimates). Larger water systems have lower per capita cost, and the cost is also affected by the number of fluoride injection points in the water system, the type of feeder and monitoring equipment, the fluoride chemical and its transportation and storage, and water plant personnel expertise. In affluent countries the cost of salt fluoridation is also negligible; developing countries may find it prohibitively expensive to import the fluoride additive. By comparison, fluoride toothpaste costs an estimated $–$ per person-year, with the incremental cost being zero for people who already brush their teeth for other reasons; and dental cleaning and application of <a href="fluoride%20varnish">fluoride varnish</a> or gel costs an estimated $ per person-year. Assuming the worst case, with the lowest estimated effectiveness and highest estimated operating costs for small cities, fluoridation costs an estimated $–$ per saved tooth-decay surface, which is lower than the estimated $ to restore the surface and the estimated $ average <a href="Present%20value">discounted</a> lifetime cost of the decayed surface, which includes the cost to maintain the restored tooth surface. It is not known how much is spent in industrial countries to treat dental fluorosis, which is mostly due to fluoride from swallowed toothpaste.

Although a 1989 workshop on <a href="cost-effectiveness">cost-effectiveness</a> of cavity prevention concluded that water fluoridation is one of the few public health measures that save more money than they cost, little high-quality research has been done on the cost-effectiveness and solid data are scarce. Dental sealants are cost-effective only when applied to high-risk children and teeth. A 2002 U.S. review estimated that on average, sealing first permanent <a href="Molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a> saves costs when they are decaying faster than 0.47 surfaces per person-year whereas water fluoridation saves costs when total decay <a href="Incidence%20%28epidemiology%29">incidence</a> exceeds 0.06 surfaces per person-year. In the U.S., water fluoridation is more cost-effective than other methods to reduce tooth decay in children, and a 2008 review concluded that water fluoridation is the best tool for combating cavities in many countries, particularly among socially disadvantaged groups. A 2016 review of studies published between 1995 to 2013 found that water fluoridation in the U.S. was cost-effective, and that it was more so in larger communities.

U.S. data from 1974 to 1992 indicate that when water fluoridation is introduced into a community, there are significant decreases in the number of employees per dental firm and the number of dental firms. The data suggest that some dentists respond to the <a href="demand%20shock">demand shock</a> by moving to non-fluoridated areas and by retraining as <a href="Dentistry%23Specialties">specialists</a>.

The <a href="water%20fluoridation%20controversy">water fluoridation controversy</a> arises from political, moral, ethical, economic, and safety concerns regarding the water fluoridation of public <a href="Water%20supply">water supplies</a>. <a href="Public%20health">Public health</a> authorities throughout the world state that water fluoridation at appropriate levels is a safe and effective means to prevent <a href="dental%20caries">dental caries</a>. Authorities' views on the most effective <a href="fluoride%20therapy">fluoride therapy</a> for community prevention of tooth decay are mixed; some state water fluoridation is most effective, while others see no special advantage and prefer topical application strategies.

Those opposed argue that water fluoridation has no or little <a href="Dental%20caries%23Prevention">cariostatic</a> benefits, may cause serious health problems, is not effective enough to justify the costs, is <a href="Clinical%20pharmacology">pharmacologically</a> obsolete, and presents a moral conflict between the <a href="common%20good">common good</a> and <a href="individual%20rights">individual rights</a>.

Spaghetti House siege

The Spaghetti House siege took place between 28 September and 3 October 1975. An attempted robbery of the Spaghetti House restaurant in <a href="Knightsbridge">Knightsbridge</a>, London, went wrong and the police were quickly on the scene. The robbers took the staff down into a storeroom and barricaded themselves in. They released all the hostages unharmed after six days. Two of the gunmen gave themselves up; the ringleader, Franklin Davies, shot himself in the stomach. All three were later imprisoned, as was one of their accomplices.

The three robbers had been involved in black liberation organisations and, from the earliest stages of the siege and throughout their subsequent prison sentences, they claimed that they were acting for political reasons. The police did not believe them, and stated that this was a criminal act, not a political one.

The police used <a href="fiber%20optic%20sensor">fibre optic camera</a> technology for live <a href="surveillance">surveillance</a>, and monitored the actions and conversations of the gunmen from the audio and visual output. The feed was watched by a <a href="forensic%20psychologist">forensic psychologist</a> who advised police on the state of the men's minds, and how to best manage the ongoing negotiations.

Post-Second World War Britain had a shortage of labour, which led to official policies to attract workers from the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> and <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> countries. These people were placed in low-pay, low-skill employment, which forced them to live in poor housing. Economic circumstances and what were seen by many in the black communities as racist policies applied by the British government, led to a rise in militancy, particularly among the West Indian community; their feelings were exacerbated by police harassment and discrimination in the education sector. <a href="Ambalavaner%20Sivanandan">Ambalavaner Sivanandan</a>, the director of the <a href="Institute%20of%20Race%20Relations">Institute of Race Relations</a> in the mid-1970s, identifies that while the first generation had become partly assimilated into British society, the second generation were increasingly rebellious.

The ringleader of the attempted robbery of a branch of the Spaghetti House restaurant was Franklin Davies, a 28-year-old Nigerian student who had previously served time in prison for <a href="armed%20robbery">armed robbery</a>; he was accompanied by two men, <a href="Shujaa%20Moshesh">Wesley Dick (later known as Shujaa Moshesh)</a>, a 24-year-old West Indian, and Anthony "Bonsu" Munroe, a 22-year-old Guyanan. All three had been involved in black liberation organisations. Davies had tried to enlist in the guerrilla armies of <a href="Zimbabwe%20African%20National%20Union">Zimbabwe African National Union</a> and <a href="FRELIMO">FRELIMO</a> in Africa; Munroe had links to the <a href="Black%20Power">Black Power</a> movement; Dick was an attendee at meetings of the <a href="Black%20Panthers">Black Panthers</a>, the <a href="Black%20Liberation%20Front">Black Liberation Front</a> (BLF), the Fasimba, and the <a href="Black%20Unity%20and%20Freedom%20Party">Black Unity and Freedom Party</a>; he regularly visited the offices of the Institute of Race Relations to volunteer and access their library. Sivanandan and Rob Waters, the historian, identify that the three men were attempting to obtain money to "finance black supplementary schools and support African liberation struggles".

In the mid-1970s, the managers of the London-based Spaghetti House restaurant chain would close their branches every Saturday night and meet at the company's <a href="Knightsbridge">Knightsbridge</a> branch. The outlet would be closed, but managers would deposit the week's takings there, before it was paid into a <a href="wikt%3Anight%20safe">night safe</a> at a nearby bank.

At approximately 1:30 am on Sunday 28 September 1975, three black men entered the Knightsbridge branch of the Spaghetti House. One carried a <a href="sawn-off%20shotgun">sawn-off shotgun</a>, the others each carried a <a href="handgun">handgun</a>. The three men demanded the week's takings from the chain – between £11,000 and £13,000. In the dim lights of the closed restaurant, the staff were able to swiftly hide the two briefcases of money under the tables. The robbers forced the restaurant staff down into the basement; the company's general manager took the opportunity to escape out of a rear fire escape while they were being moved. He alerted the <a href="Metropolitan%20Police%20Service">Metropolitan Police</a>, who arrived on the scene within minutes. The getaway driver, Samuel Addison, saw the plan had gone wrong, and drove off in a stolen Ford. When the police entered the ground floor of the restaurant, Davies and his colleagues forced the restaurant staff into a rear storeroom measuring , locked the door, barricaded it with beer kegs and shouted to the police that they would shoot if they approached the door; the police surrounded the building and the <a href="Siege%23Police%20activity">siege</a> began.

In the initial conversations, the hostage-takers provided the police with the names of the hostages they held and Davies's identity and criminal record was established. By 7:00 am the police had sealed off the area and put a cordon in place; 400 police officers were involved—including dog-handlers—and <a href="Specialist%20Firearms%20Command">D11</a>, the Metropolitan Police's marksmen, was deployed.

Davies informed police that he was a captain in the BLF, but in a subsequent message said that the men were members of the <a href="Black%20Liberation%20Army">Black Liberation Army</a>, a <a href="Black%20Panther%20Party">Black Panther</a> splinter group. Davies made several demands to the police. He wanted two black prisoners released from prison, although he did not know that they had already been released. He also wanted the <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a> to visit the siege, an aircraft made available to fly to the West Indies and a radio for them to listen to the news broadcasts of the situation. Only the request for a radio was granted.

Initially the police considered that the siege may have been a terrorist incident, but were subsequently dismissive of any political motivation, and insisted that it was only ever a criminal action. <a href="Robert%20Mark">Sir Robert Mark</a>—the <a href="Commissioner%20of%20Police%20of%20the%20Metropolis">Commissioner</a> of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Police">Metropolitan Police</a> at the time of the siege—later wrote:

From the outset it was rightly assumed that this was a simple armed robbery that had gone wrong and any attempts by Davies, the Nigerian, to represent it as a political act were received with the derision they clearly deserved.

Tony Soares, one of the founders of the BLF, told police he knew the three men, and offered to mediate in the negotiations, but his offer was turned down. He added that the BLF was a peaceful organisation, and that it did not know of or support the robbery. Jenny Bourne, the co-editor of "<a href="Race%20%26amp%3B%20Class">Race & Class</a>", knew all three men and thinks they "probably had very different motives" for the robbery. Overall she considers the three, particularly Wesley Dick were driven by

the actualities of racism on the ground in Britain ... It was essentially the words of <a href="Angela%20Davis">Angela Davis</a>, <a href="George%20Jackson%20%28activist%29">George Jackson</a>, <a href="Bobby%20Seale">Bobby Seale</a> and <a href="Malcolm%20X">Malcolm X</a> that honed the resistance: 'Seize the time', 'Off the pigs', 'Fuck the man' were the themes they transposed to Britain.

On the morning of 29 September—fifteen hours after the siege had begun—one of the hostages was released as a sign of good faith. He was a 59-year-old manager of one of the outlets. On the second day another hostage was released after he fell ill. During the course of the siege Mario Manca, the Italian <a href="consul%20general">consul general</a> attempted to liaise with the men, acting as a go-between. At one stage he offered to change places with one of the hostages who was unwell, but the offer was declined. <a href="David%20Pitt%2C%20Baron%20Pitt%20of%20Hampstead">Lord Pitt</a>, the former chairman of the <a href="Greater%20London%20Council">Greater London Council</a> who was West Indian-born, also attempted to negotiate with the men, but had limited success.

Dr Peter Scott, a <a href="forensic%20psychologist">forensic psychologist</a> at the <a href="Maudsley%20Hospital">Maudsley Hospital</a>, gave advice about the mental state of the criminals throughout the siege. He told the police that the longer the siege went on, the more an emotional transference would take place, in which the gunmen would be less likely to kill the hostages. On his advice, the main strategy of the police was to wait as long as was needed, keep the situation calm and to talk to the hostage takers as long as possible. The siege saw an early use of <a href="fiber%20optic%20sensor">fibre optic camera</a> technology by the police as a live <a href="surveillance">surveillance</a> technique. Two cameras were used to observe what was happening in the basement storeroom. One was threaded through the wall alongside a hot water pipe; the second way was through a vent, after acid was dripped onto the metal vent using an eyedropper, to make a small hole. The police were able to monitor the movement and conversations of the three hostage-takers.

The police persuaded the media to assist them. They asked "<a href="The%20Daily%20Mail">The Daily Mail</a>" not to publish a story about the arrest of one of the gang's associates. Using the information and advice from Scott, the police attempted to drive a wedge between Davies and his two colleagues. On the fourth day the police pushed a copy of "<a href="The%20Daily%20Express">The Daily Express</a>" under the door of the storeroom. It showed a photograph of Davies on the front page, describing him as the leader, and providing background information from his associates, making it look like the gang's associates were selling the information to the newspapers. Across the front page, the police wrote the name of the person suspected of providing the arms. The following day, when two of the co-conspirators were arrested, police briefed the media about the arrests and stressed the criminal, not political, aspects of the case. The men heard the news on the radio that evening, which lowered their spirits. The following morning, the men decided to surrender.

At 2:55 am the gunmen turned out the lights and began a discussion among themselves. At 3:40 am they told the police that they were giving up. After the hostages came out first—all unharmed—the police told the three men to come out one at a time. The first two threw their guns out and followed; as police led them away there was a gunshot from the room, where Davies had shot himself in the stomach with a <a href=".22%20Long%20Rifle">.22 rimfire</a> revolver. In his pocket police found a note he had written to his brother just before the robbery:

Today I set out on a mission for the people. If things go wrong I shall pass over to the warrior's rest. So if this note reaches you, it would mean that I am dead.
You must accept what happens to me as it should be accepted—with joy—because it is the most natural fate that awaits any of us blacks conscious enough to try and do something about our pathetic state of existence.

Davies was taken to <a href="St%20George%27s%20Hospital">St George's Hospital</a> where he underwent an operation; the bullet was not removed during the process. The hostages were also taken to the same hospital for a check-up, but none needed treatment. They then gave preliminary statements to the police at Cannon Street police station.

While <a href="Remand%20%28detention%29">on remand</a>, Davies went on hunger strike. He was visited regularly by Giovanni Scrano, one of the hostages from the siege, who had built up a relationship with Davies during the incident; the relationship was later identified as an example of <a href="Stockholm%20syndrome">Stockholm syndrome</a>.

The trial opened on 8 June 1976. As well as Davies, Dick and Munroe, three accomplices were present, charged with different offences, including assisting the robbery (the getaway driver), supplying firearms, and conspiracy charges. Davies, Dick and Munroe refused to accept the legitimacy of the court. When asked how they pleaded to the charges, Davies shouted "We've stopped pleading—we've been pleading for 500 years. This isn't a trial—it's a lynching party." The three men turned their backs on the court and talked between themselves. The judge, <a href="Mervyn%20Griffith-Jones">Mervyn Griffith-Jones</a>, ordered that the three men be taken back to their cells and that a plea of not guilty be entered on their behalf. One of the accomplices, Lillo Termaine, pleaded guilty to the charges of conspiracy to rob the restaurant. Police said that he had been the one behind the robbery, and had planned it to pay off gambling debts. The trial ended on 30 June. Davies, Dick and Munroe were sentenced to 22, 18 and 17 years in prison respectively, Termaine was given six years. One of the accomplices was acquitted and Addison, the getaway driver, was sent for re-trial as the jury could not reach a verdict. That November, following the second trial, Addison was found guilty and gaoled for eleven years. Davies, Dick and Munroe died after being released from prison, two of them at relatively young ages; Dick changed his name to Shujaa Moshesh by the time of his death in Africa.

The Spaghetti House restaurant re-opened for business a week after the siege ended. In 2015 the Knightsbridge branch closed for business so the block could be redeveloped.

In 1976 <a href="Horace%20Ov%C3%A9">Horace Ové</a>, a Trinidadian-born writer and filmmaker, wrote the play "A Hole in Babylon", based on the events at the restaurant; the play was later broadcast on the BBC's "<a href="Play%20for%20Today">Play for Today</a>" series. Another fictionalised account of the crime, "The Siege of Babylon", was written by <a href="Farrukh%20Dhondy">Farrukh Dhondy</a> in 1978. In 1982 "<a href="Spaghetti%20House">Spaghetti House</a>", an Italian comedy film, was produced which was loosely based on the events of the siege.

In early December 1975 an <a href="active%20service%20unit">active service unit</a> of the <a href="Provisional%20Irish%20Republican%20Army">Provisional Irish Republican Army</a> (IRA) were cornered in a flat on Balcombe Street, London, leading to a <a href="Balcombe%20Street%20siege">six-day siege</a> by police. The lessons learned from the Spaghetti House siege, including the use of live surveillance and forensic psychologists, were put into use to bring the siege to a successful conclusion for the police. <a href="Peter%20Waddington">Peter Waddington</a>, in his study of policing, writes that the police's "reputation for restraint received dramatic vindication by the way in which two highly publicised sieges were handled by the Metropolitan Police". The police used the same tactics at the <a href="Iranian%20Embassy%20siege">Iranian Embassy siege</a> in 1980, until the terrorists killed one of the hostages, which led to a change in tactics and the use of the <a href="Special%20Air%20Service">Special Air Service</a> to storm the building. Waddington considers "If there was criticism it was that the police showed an excessive disinclination to resort to force in such circumstances."

William Hayden English

William Hayden English (August 27, 1822 – February 7, 1896) was an American <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">US Representative</a> from <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a> and the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> nominee for vice president in 1880. English entered politics at a young age, becoming a part of <a href="Jesse%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BD.%20Bright">Jesse D. Bright</a>'s conservative faction of the <a href="Indiana%20Democratic%20Party">Indiana Democratic Party</a>. After a few years in the federal bureaucracy in Washington beginning in 1845, he returned to Indiana and participated in the state constitutional convention of 1850. He was elected to the <a href="Indiana%20House%20of%20Representatives">Indiana House of Representatives</a> in 1851 and served as its speaker at the age of twenty-nine. After a two-year term in the state house, English represented Indiana in the federal House of Representatives for four terms from 1853 to 1861, working most notably to achieve a compromise on the <a href="Bleeding%20Kansas">admission of Kansas as a state</a>.

English retired from the House in 1861, but remained involved in party affairs. In the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> he was a <a href="War%20Democrat">War Democrat</a>, supporting the Union war effort. As well as pursuing a political career, he was an author and businessman. He owned an opera house, was president of a bank, and developed many residential properties. English was successful in business, and became one of the wealthiest men in Indiana. After nearly two decades in the private sector, English returned to political life as the Democratic nominee for vice president in 1880. English and his presidential running mate, <a href="Winfield%20Scott%20Hancock">Winfield Scott Hancock</a>, lost narrowly to their Republican opponents, <a href="James%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BA.%20Garfield">James A. Garfield</a> and <a href="Chester%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BA.%20Arthur">Chester A. Arthur</a>.

William Hayden English was born August 27, 1822, in <a href="Lexington%2C%20Indiana">Lexington, Indiana</a>, the only son of Elisha Gale English and his wife, Mahala (Eastin) English. Both his parents were <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a> natives from slaveholding families of English and French <a href="Huguenot">Huguenot</a> ancestry. They moved to southern Indiana in 1818. Elisha English quickly became involved in local politics as a <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrat</a>, serving in the state legislature as well as building a prominent business career. William English was educated in the local public schools, later attending <a href="Hanover%20College">Hanover College</a>. He left college after three years and began to <a href="Reading%20law">read law</a>. In 1840, English was admitted to the <a href="Bar%20%28law%29">bar</a> at the age of eighteen and soon built a practice in his native <a href="Scott%20County%2C%20Indiana">Scott County</a>. He started early in politics as well, attending the state Democratic convention that same year and giving speeches on behalf of the Democratic presidential candidate, <a href="Martin%20Van%20Buren">Martin Van Buren</a>.

By the end of 1842, English came under the mentorship of <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Indiana">Lieutenant Governor</a> <a href="Jesse%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BD.%20Bright">Jesse D. Bright</a>, who helped him rise within Bright's faction of the party. The following year, <a href="Indiana%20House%20of%20Representatives">Indiana House of Representatives</a> selected English as their clerk. In 1844, he worked the campaign trail, this time in the service of presidential candidate <a href="James%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BK.%20Polk">James K. Polk</a>.

As a reward, after Polk took office in 1845, he granted English a <a href="Spoils%20system">patronage</a> appointment as a clerk in the federal <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Department</a> in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> English held this position for four years, during which time he met Emma Mardulia Jackson. They married in November 1847. They would have two children: <a href="William%20Eastin%20English">William Eastin</a> and Rosalind.

English attended the <a href="1848%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1848 Democratic National Convention</a> in <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>, where he supported <a href="Lewis%20Cass">Lewis Cass</a>, the eventual presidential nominee. With the election of the <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig Party</a>'s candidate, <a href="Zachary%20Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a>, to the presidency, a Whig party member replaced English at the Treasury Department. He secured a job as clerk to the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a>'s <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Claims">Claims Committee</a> through party connections; serving until 1850 in Washington, DC.

Later that year, English and his wife returned to Indiana, where he worked as secretary to the Indiana <a href="constitutional%20convention%20%28political%20meeting%29">Constitutional Convention</a>. Democrats were in the majority at the convention, and their proposals were included in the new law, including increasing the number of elective offices, guaranteeing a <a href="homestead%20exemption">homestead exemption</a>, and restricting voting rights to white men. <a href="Free%20Negroes">Free blacks</a> had earlier had formerly had suffrage in the state. The voters approved the new <a href="Constitution%20of%20Indiana%23Constitution%20of%201851">Constitution of 1851</a> by a large majority.

In August 1851, English won his first election to the state house of Representatives. As it was the first meeting of the legislature under the 1851 constitution, English's knowledge of it contributed to his election, at the age of twenty-nine, as speaker of the House. The House had a Democratic majority and at Bright's direction, English worked for the election of <a href="Graham%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BN.%20Fitch">Graham N. Fitch</a>, a member of Bright's faction of the party, to the federal Senate. The legislature chose a different Democrat, <a href="John%20Pettit">John Pettit</a>, instead. Holding the office of Speaker increased English's influence throughout the state; in 1852, the Democrats chose him as their nominee for the federal House of Representatives from the newly redistricted <a href="Indiana%27s%202nd%20congressional%20district">2nd district</a>. The Democrats were victorious in the election that October, sweeping all but one House seat. English defeated his Whig opponent 55% - 45% and joined the <a href="33rd%20United%20States%20Congress">33rd Congress</a> when it convened in Washington in 1853.

The House of Representatives convened for the 33rd Congress in December 1853. At that time, the simmering disagreement between the <a href="Slave%20and%20free%20states">free and slave states</a> heated up with the introduction of the <a href="Kansas%E2%80%93Nebraska%20Act">Kansas–Nebraska Act</a>, proposed by Illinois Democrat <a href="Stephen%20A.%20Douglas">Stephen A. Douglas</a>, which would open the <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a> and <a href="Nebraska">Nebraska</a> territories to slavery, an implicit repeal of the <a href="Missouri%20Compromise">Missouri Compromise</a> of 1820. Intended to quiet national agitation over slavery by shifting the decision to local settlers, Douglas's proposal instead inflamed anti-slavery sentiment in the North by allowing the possibility of slavery's expansion to territories held as free soil for three decades. English, a member of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Territories">Committee on Territories</a>, thought the bill was unnecessary and disagreed with its timing; when the committee approved the bill, English wrote a minority report to that effect. He was not altogether opposed to the principle of <a href="Popular%20sovereignty%20in%20the%20United%20States">popular sovereignty</a>, however, believing that "each organized community ought to be allowed to decide for itself". Northern Democrats divided almost evenly on the bill, but English, despite his stated reservations, was among those who voted for it. In doing so, he said that Congress was bound to respect the decision of the territories' residents and pledged to uphold their decisions. President <a href="Franklin%20Pierce">Franklin Pierce</a> signed the bill into law on May 30, 1854.

In December 1857, in an election boycotted by free-state partisans, Kansas adopted the pro-slavery <a href="Lecompton%20Constitution">Lecompton Constitution</a> and petitioned Congress to be admitted as a slave state. President <a href="James%20Buchanan">James Buchanan</a>, a Democrat, urged that Congress take up the matter, and the Senate approved a bill to admit Kansas. The bill was defeated in the House, 112–120. English found the process by which the pro-slavery Kansans forced through their constitution inadequate, and voted against admission. Congress continued to debate the matter for months without resolution. English and <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> Democrat <a href="Alexander%20H.%20Stephens">Alexander H. Stephens</a> came up with a compromise measure, later called the English Bill. The English Bill offered Kansas admission as a slave state, but only if they endorsed that choice in a referendum. The Bill also required Kansans to renounce the unusually large grant of federal lands they had requested in the Lecompton Constitution. The Kansas voters could, thus, reject Lecompton by the face-saving measure of turning down the smaller land grant. Congress passed the English Bill, and Kansans duly rejected their pro-slavery constitution by a ratio of six to one. Some of English's political allies, including Bright (now a senator), would have preferred Kansas be admitted as a slave state, but the decision was popular enough in his district to allow English to be reelected in 1858 with a majority of 56% to 44%.

English declined to run for reelection in 1860, but did give several speeches advocating compromise and moderation in the growing North-South divide. After <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>'s election that year, English urged Southerners not to secede. When the Southern states did secede and the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> began, Governor <a href="Oliver%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BP.%20Morton">Oliver P. Morton</a> offered English command of a regiment, but he declined it, having no military knowledge or interests. He did, however, support Morton's (and Lincoln's) war policies and considered himself a <a href="War%20Democrat">War Democrat</a>. English loaned money to the state government to cover the expenses of outfitting the troops and served as <a href="provost%20marshal">provost marshal</a> for the 2nd congressional district.

After retiring from Congress, English spent a year at his home in Scott County before relocating to <a href="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a>, the state capital. English and ten associates (including <a href="James%20Lanier">James Lanier</a>) organized the <a href="First%20National%20Bank%20of%20Indianapolis">First National Bank of Indianapolis</a> in 1863, the first bank in that city chartered under the new <a href="National%20Bank%20Act">National Bank Act</a>. He remained president of that bank until 1877, including the difficult period during the <a href="Panic%20of%201873">Panic of 1873</a>, when many other banks folded. English's business interests included other industries as well. He became the controlling shareholder of the <a href="Indianapolis%20Street%20Railway%20Company">Indianapolis Street Railway Company</a>, remaining in charge of that company until 1876, when he sold his shares. Having also sold his shares of the bank by 1877, English turned most of his investment capital to real estate. By 1875, he had already ordered construction of seventy-five houses along what is now English Avenue. His wife, Emma, died two years later, in 1877. English survived her by nineteen years. By the time he died in 1896, he owned 448 pieces of property, most of them in Indianapolis.

In 1880, English constructed English's Opera House, which, according to the 1994 "Encyclopedia of Indianapolis," quickly became known as the city's finest. The building was modeled after the <a href="Pike%27s%20Opera%20House">Grand Opera House</a> in New York and seated 2000 people. It opened on September 27, 1880, with a performance of "<a href="Hamlet%20%28opera%29">Hamlet</a>" starring <a href="Lawrence%20Barrett">Lawrence Barrett</a>. By that time, English was involved in politics once more. He turned over management of the Opera House to his son, <a href="William%20Eastin%20English">William Eastin English</a>, who was interested in the theater (and had just married an actress, Annie Fox). English senior later added a hotel to the Opera House, and both operated until 1948.

After leaving the House of Representatives, English had remained in touch with local politics, and served as chairman of the Indiana Democratic Party. His son had been elected to the state house in 1879, and the elder English was still consulted on political matters. Although he had not sought elected office since 1858, he had raised his national profile in 1879 through several interviews and letters to friendly newspapers. English attended the <a href="1880%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1880 Democratic National Convention</a> in <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a> as a member of the Indiana delegation, where he favored presidential candidate <a href="Thomas%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BF.%20Bayard">Thomas F. Bayard</a> of <a href="Delaware">Delaware</a>, whom he admired for his support of the gold standard. The first ballot was inconclusive, with Bayard in second place. Major General <a href="Winfield%20Scott%20Hancock">Winfield Scott Hancock</a> of <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> led the voting, and on the second ballot was nominated for President.

The Indiana delegation held back their votes from Hancock until the crucial moment, and as a reward, the delegates selected English for the vice-presidential nomination. The nomination was unanimous. He was not expected to add much to the ticket outside of Indiana, but the party leaders thought his popularity in that <a href="swing%20state">swing state</a> would help Hancock against <a href="James%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BA.%20Garfield">James A. Garfield</a> and <a href="Chester%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BA.%20Arthur">Chester A. Arthur</a>, the Republican nominees. The Republicans believed that the real reason for English's nomination was his willingness to use his personal fortune to finance the campaign, as Democratic campaign coffers were low. English gave a brief speech accepting the nomination, then replied more formally in a letter a month later. In that letter, English called the disputes of the Civil War settled, and promised a "sound currency, of honest money", the restriction of <a href="Chinese%20immigration%20to%20the%20United%20States">Chinese immigration</a>, and a "rigid economy in public expenditure". He characterized the election as one between 

Hancock and the Democrats expected to carry the <a href="Solid%20South">Solid South</a>, which, with the <a href="Disfranchisement%20after%20the%20Reconstruction%20Era">disenfranchisement of black Southerners</a> following the end of <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction</a>, was dominated electorally by white Democrats. In addition to the South, the ticket needed to add a few of the Midwestern states to their total to win the election; national elections in that era were largely decided by closely divided states there. The practical differences between the parties were few, and the Republicans were reluctant to attack Hancock personally because of his heroic reputation. The one policy difference the Republicans were able to exploit was a statement in the Democratic platform endorsing "a <a href="Tariffs%20in%20United%20States%20history">tariff</a> for revenue only". Garfield's campaign used this statement to paint the Democrats as unsympathetic to the plight of industrial laborers, who supposedly benefited from the high protective tariff then in place. The tariff issue cut Democratic support in industrialized Northern states, which were essential in establishing a Democratic majority.

The October state elections in Ohio and Indiana resulted in Republican victories there, discouraging Democrats about the federal election to come the following month. There was even some talk among party leaders of dropping English from the ticket, but English convinced them that the October losses owed more to local issues, and that the Democratic ticket could still carry Indiana, if not Ohio, in November. In the end, English was proven wrong: the Democrats and Hancock failed to carry any of the Midwestern states they had targeted, including Indiana. Hancock and English lost the popular vote by just 7,018. The electoral vote, however, had a much larger spread: 214 for Garfield and Arthur, compared to 155 for Hancock and English.

English resumed his business career after the election. He also became more interested in local history, joining a reunion of the survivors of the 1850 state constitutional convention, which met at his opera house in 1885. He became the president of the <a href="Indiana%20Historical%20Society">Indiana Historical Society</a> and wrote two volumes, which were published at his death: "Conquest of the Country <a href="Northwest%20Territory">Northwest of the River Ohio</a>, 1778–1783"; and "Life of General <a href="George%20Rogers%20Clark">George Rogers Clark</a>". He served on the Indianapolis Monument Commission in 1893, and helped to plan and finance the <a href="Soldiers%27%20and%20Sailors%27%20Monument%20%28Indianapolis%29">Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument</a> there.

He died at his home in Indianapolis on February 7, 1896. English was interred in <a href="Crown%20Hill%20Cemetery">Crown Hill Cemetery</a> with his wife, who had died in 1877. Although many of the buildings he constructed have been demolished, <a href="English%2C%20Indiana">English, Indiana</a>, the county seat of <a href="Crawford%20County%2C%20Indiana">Crawford County</a>, is named after him, as is English Street in Indianapolis. Identical statues of English stand in front of the Scott County Courthouse in <a href="Scottsburg%2C%20Indiana">Scottsburg, Indiana</a>, and at the Crawford County Fairgrounds in English. His son William served in Congress from 1884 to 1885. His grandson, <a href="William%20English%20Walling">William English Walling</a>, the son of his daughter Rosalind, was a co-founder of the <a href="National%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Colored%20People">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a>. An extensive collection of English's personal and family papers is housed at the Indiana Historical Society in Indianapolis, where it is open for research.

Street newspaper

Street newspapers (or street papers) are <a href="newspaper">newspaper</a>s or <a href="magazines">magazines</a> sold by <a href="homelessness">homeless</a> or <a href="poverty">poor</a> individuals and produced mainly to support these populations. Most such newspapers primarily provide coverage about homelessness and poverty-related issues, and seek to strengthen social networks within homeless communities. Street papers aim to give these individuals both employment opportunities and a voice in their community. In addition to being sold by homeless individuals, many of these papers are partially produced and written by them.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries several publications by charity, religious, and labor organizations tried to draw attention to the homeless, but street newspapers only became common after the founding of New York City's "<a href="Street%20News">Street News</a>" in 1989. Similar papers are now published in over 30 countries, with most located in the United States and Western Europe. They are supported by governments, charities, and coalitions such as the <a href="International%20Network%20of%20Street%20Papers">International Network of Street Papers</a> and the <a href="North%20American%20Street%20Newspaper%20Association">North American Street Newspaper Association</a>. Although street newspapers have multiplied, many still face challenges, including funding shortages, unreliable staff and difficulty in generating interest and maintaining an audience.

Street newspapers are sold mainly by homeless individuals, but the newspapers vary in how much content is submitted by them and how much of the coverage pertains to them: while some papers are written and published mainly by homeless contributors, others have a professional staff and attempt to emulate mainstream publications. These differences have caused controversy among street newspaper publishers over what type of material should be covered and to what extent the homeless should participate in writing and production. One popular street newspaper, "<a href="The%20Big%20Issue">The Big Issue</a>", has been a focus of this controversy because it concentrates on attracting a large readership through coverage of mainstream issues and <a href="popular%20culture">popular culture</a>, whereas other newspapers emphasize homeless advocacy and social issues and earn less of a profit.

Although the modern street newspaper began with the 1989 publication of "<a href="Street%20News">Street News</a>" in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, and the Street Sheet in San Francisco, 1989, newspapers sold by the poor and homeless to generate income and to bring attention to social problems date back to the late 19th century; <a href="journalism">journalism</a> scholar Norma Fay Green has cited "<a href="The%20War%20Cry">The War Cry</a>", created by the <a href="Salvation%20Army">Salvation Army</a> in <a href="London">London</a> in 1879, as an early form of "dissident, underground, alternative publication". "The War Cry" was sold by <a href="Officer%20of%20The%20Salvation%20Army">Salvation Army officers</a> and the <a href="working%20poor">working poor</a> to draw people's attention to the poor living conditions of these individuals. Another precursor to the modern street newspaper was <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>'s "<a href="Hobo%20News">Hobo News</a>", which ran from 1915 to 1930 and featured writing from prominent labor and social activists as well as <a href="Industrial%20Workers%20of%20the%20World">Industrial Workers of the World</a> members, alongside contributions of oral history, creative writing, and artwork from <a href="hobo">hobo</a>es, or itinerant beggars. Most street papers published before 1970, such as "<a href="The%20Catholic%20Worker">The Catholic Worker</a>" (founded in 1933), were affiliated with religious organizations. Like workers' papers and other forms of <a href="alternative%20media">alternative media</a> in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, early street newspapers were often created because the founders believed mainstream news did not cover issues that were relevant to ordinary people.

Modern street newspapers began to emerge in the United States in the late 1980s in response to <a href="Homelessness%20in%20the%20United%20States%231980s">increasing levels of homelessness</a> and homeless advocates' dissatisfaction with the <a href="mainstream%20media">mainstream media</a>'s portrayals of the homeless. At the time, many media outlets portrayed homeless people as being all criminals and drug addicts, and suggested that homelessness was a result of laziness rather than societal or political factors. Thus, one motivation for the creation of the first street newspapers was to counter the negative coverage of homeless people that was coming from existing media.

"<a href="Street%20News">Street News</a>," founded in late 1989 in New York City, is frequently cited as the first modern street newspaper. While some small papers were already being published when it was founded, "Street News" attracted the most attention and became the "catalyst" for many other papers. Many more street papers were launched in the early 1990s, crediting the high-profile New York paper as their inspiration, such as "<a href="Spare%20Change%20News">Spare Change News</a>" in <a href="Boston">Boston</a> founded in 1992. During this period, an average of five new papers were created every year. This growth has been attributed both to changing attitudes and policies towards homeless individuals and to the ease of publishing provided by desktop computers; After 1989, at least 100 papers sprung up in over 30 countries. By 2008, an estimated 32 million people worldwide read street newspapers, and 250,000 poor, disadvantaged, or homeless individuals sold or contributed to them.
Street papers have been started in many major cities worldwide, mainly in the United States and <a href="Western%20Europe">Western Europe</a>. They have especially proliferated in <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, which in 1999 had more street newspapers than the rest of Europe combined, and in <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>, where the street papers "<a href="Aluma%20%28street%20paper%29">Aluma</a>", "<a href="Situation%20Sthlm">Situation Sthlm</a>" and "<a href="Faktum">Faktum</a>" won the 2006 grand prize award for journalism of the <a href="Swedish%20Publicists%27%20Association">Swedish Publicists' Association</a>. Street papers have been established in some cities in Canada, Africa, South America, and Asia. Even within the United States, some street newspapers (such as <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>'s bilingual "Hasta Cuando") are published in languages other than English.

In the mid-1990s, coalitions were established to strengthen the street newspaper movement. The <a href="International%20Network%20of%20Street%20Papers">International Network of Street Papers (INSP)</a> (founded in 1994) and the <a href="North%20American%20Street%20Newspaper%20Association">North American Street Newspaper Association (NASNA)</a> (founded in 1997) aim to provide support for street papers and to "uphold ethical standards". In particular, the INSP was established to help groups that were starting new street newspapers, to bring more mainstream media attention to the street newspaper movement during the 1990s, and to support interaction and cross-talk between street paper publishers and staff from different countries. The INSP and the NASNA voted to combine their resources in 2006; they have collaborated to found the <a href="Street%20News%20Service">Street News Service</a>, a project which collects articles from member papers and archives them on the internet. National street paper coalitions have also been formed in Europe (there is a national coalition in <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, and the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> has the "<a href="Straatmedia%20Groep%20Nederland">Straatmedia Groep Nederland</a>").

Most street newspapers have three main purposes:

The defining characteristic of a street newspaper is that it is sold by homeless or marginalized vendors. While many street newspapers aim to provide coverage of social issues and educate the public about homelessness, this goal is often secondary: many people who buy street newspapers do so to support and express solidarity with the homeless vendor, rather than to read the paper.

The precise demographics of the readership of street newspapers is unclear. A pair of 1993 surveys conducted by Chicago's "<a href="StreetWise">StreetWise</a>" suggested that the paper's readers at the time tended to be college-educated, with slightly over half being female, and slightly over half unmarried.

Most street newspapers operate by selling the papers to homeless vendors for a fraction of the retail price (usually between 10% and 50%), after which the vendors sell the papers for the retail price and retain all the proceeds from street sales. The income vendors earn from sales is intended to help them "get back on their feet". The purpose of requiring vendors to purchase papers up front and earn back the money by selling them is to help them develop skills in financial management. Vendors for most newspapers are identifiable by badges or messenger bags. Many newspapers require that vendors sign a code of conduct or otherwise "clean up their act".

Most street newspaper vendors in the United States and United Kingdom are homeless individuals, although in several other countries (especially in Europe) papers are mainly sold by <a href="refugee">refugee</a>s. Nevertheless, not all vendors are homeless; some have stable housing situations but are unable to hold other jobs, while others started out homeless but were eventually able to use their income from sales to find housing. In general, the major American street newspapers do not require prospective vendors to show proof of homelessness or poverty, and they do not require vendors to retire once they find stable housing. In the United States, since 2008 there have been a growing number of vendors who are "newly needy"—only recently homeless, or with only temporary financial difficulty—as opposed to the "chronically homeless" who have traditionally made up the majority of the vendor force. These vendors are often well-educated and have extensive work experience, but lost their jobs in the <a href="2008%20financial%20crisis">2008 financial crisis</a>.

Street papers start in a variety of ways. Some, such as "<a href="Street%20Sense%20%28newspaper%29">Street Sense</a>", are begun by homeless or formerly homeless individuals, whereas others are more professional ventures. Many, particularly in the United States, receive aid from local government and charities, and coalitions such as the International Network of Street Papers and the North American Street Newspaper Association provide workshops and support for new street papers. Many develop in a bottom-up fashion, starting up through volunteer work and "newcomers to the media business" and gradually expanding to include professionals. For most papers, the majority of revenue comes from sales, donations, and government grants, while some receive advertising revenue from local businesses. There has been some disagreement among street newspaper publishers and supporters over whether papers should accept advertising, with some arguing that advertising is practical and helps support the paper, and others claiming that many kinds of advertisements are inappropriate in a paper that is mainly geared towards the poor.

Specific business models for street newspapers vary widely, ranging from vendor-managed papers that place the highest value upon homeless empowerment and involvement to highly professionalized and commercialized weeklies. Some papers (especially in Europe) operate as autonomous businesses, while others operate as parts of existing organizations or projects. There are papers that are very successful, such as the UK-based "The Big Issue", which in 2001 sold nearly 300,000 copies a week and earned the equivalent of 1 million<a href="United%20States%20dollar">USD</a> in profits, but many papers sell as few as 3,000 copies a month and barely generate a profit at all for the publishers.

Most street newspapers report on issues regarding homelessness and poverty, sometimes functioning as a main source of information on policy changes and other practical issues that are relevant to the homeless but may go unreported in mainstream media. Many feature contributions from the homeless and the poor in addition to articles by <a href="activist">activist</a>s and <a href="community%20organizer">community organizer</a>s, including profiles of individual street newspaper vendors. For example, the first edition of <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>'s "<a href="Street%20Sense%20%28newspaper%29">Street Sense</a>" included a description of a prominent homeless community, an interview with a congresswoman, an editorial about the costs and benefits of taking a job, several poems about homelessness, a how-to column, and a section for recipes. A 2009 issue of the <a href="Lawrence%2C%20Kansas">Lawrence, Kansas</a>-based "<a href="Change%20of%20Heart%20%28street%20paper%29">Change of Heart</a>" included a story on the recent bulldozing of a homeless camp, a review of a book on homelessness, a description of the Family Promise organization for homeless support, and a list of community resources; much of this content was submitted by the homeless. The writing style is often simple and clear; social scientist Kevin Howley describes street newspapers as having a "native eloquence".

According to Howley, street newspapers are similar to <a href="citizen%20journalism">citizen journalism</a> in that both are a response to the perceived shortcomings of the mainstream media and both encourage involvement by non-professionals. A major difference between the two, however, is that the citizen journalism movement does not necessarily advocate a particular position, whereas street newspapers openly advocate for the homeless and poor.

Unlike most street newspapers, the <a href="United%20Kingdom">UK</a>-based "The Big Issue" focuses mostly on celebrity news and interviews, rather than coverage of homelessness and poverty. It is still sold by homeless vendors and uses the bulk of its proceeds to support homeless individuals and advocacy organizations for the homeless, but the paper's content is mostly written by professional staff and geared towards a broad audience. Because of its professional nature and high production values, it has been a frequent target of criticism in an ongoing debate between adherents of professional and <a href="grassroots">grassroots</a> ideals of how street newspapers should work.

In addition to providing some individuals with income and employment, street newspapers are intended to give homeless participants responsibility and independence, and to create a tight-knit homeless community. Many offer additional programs to vendors, such as job training, housing placement assistance, and referral to other direct services. Others operate as a program of a larger social services organization—for instance, Chicago's "StreetWise" can refer vendors to providers of "drug and alcohol treatment, high school equivalency classes, career counseling, and permanent housing". Most are engaged in some form of organizing and advocacy regarding homelessness and poverty, and many function as "watchdogs" for the local homeless communities. Howley has described street newspapers as a means of mobilizing the networks of "formal and informal relationships that exist between the homeless, the unemployed, and the working poor, and shelter managers, healthcare workers, community organizers, and others who work on their behalf".

In the early days of street newspapers, people were often reluctant to buy from homeless vendors for fear that they were being scammed. Furthermore, many of the more activist papers fail to sell well because their writing and production are perceived to be unprofessional and lackluster. Topics covered are sometimes seen as lacking newsworthy content, and of little relevance or interest to the general public or the homeless community. Organizations in <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a> and <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> have responded to these criticisms by offering workshops in writing and journalism for homeless contributors. Papers such as "StreetWise" have in the past been criticized as "grim" and for having vendors that are too loud and intrusive. Some newspapers sell well but may not be widely read, as many people will donate to vendors without buying, or buy the newspaper and then throw it away. Howley has described readers' hesitance or unwillingness to read the papers as "compassion fatigue". On the other hand, those papers that do sell well and are widely read, such as "The Big Issue", are often targets of criticism for being too "mainstream" or commercial.

Other difficulties street newspapers face include high <a href="turnover%20%28employment%29">turnover</a> of "transient" or unreliable staff, lack of adequate funding, lack of journalistic freedom for papers that are funded by local government, and, among some demographics, lack of interest in homeless issues. For example, journalism professor Jim Cunningham has attributed the difficulties in selling <a href="Calgary">Calgary</a>'s "Calgary Street Talk" to the fact that the mostly <a href="middle-class">middle-class</a>, conservative population has "not enough sensitivity to the causes of homelessness". Finally, <a href="anti-homeless%20legislation">anti-homeless legislation</a> often targets street newspapers and vendors; for example, in New York City and <a href="Cleveland">Cleveland</a>, laws have prevented vendors from selling papers on <a href="public%20transit">public transit</a> or other high-traffic areas, making it difficult for the papers "Street News" and "<a href="Homeless%20Grapevine">Homeless Grapevine</a>" to earn revenue.

Among proponents and publishers of street newspapers there is disagreement over how street newspapers should be run and what their goals should be, reflecting a "clash between two philosophies for advocating social change". On one side of the debate are papers that seek to function like a business and generate a profit and a wide readership in order to benefit the homeless in a practical way; on the other are papers that seek to provide a "voice" to the homeless and poor without watering down their message for a broad readership. Timothy Harris, the director of "<a href="Real%20Change">Real Change</a>", has described the two camps as "liberal entrepreneurial" and "radical, grassroots activist".

Controversy surrounding "The Big Issue", the world's most widely circulated street newspaper, is a good example of these two schools of thought. "The Big Issue" is mostly a tabloid covering celebrity news; while it is sold by the homeless and generates a profit that is used to benefit the homeless, the content is not written by them and there is little coverage of social issues that are relevant to them. In the late 1990s when the London-based paper began making plans to enter markets in the United States, many American street newspaper publishers reacted defensively, saying they could not compete with the production values and mainstream appeal of the professionally produced "The Big Issue" or that "The Big Issue" did not do enough to provide a voice to the homeless. The reaction to "The Big Issue" raised what is now an ongoing conflict between commercialized, professional papers and more grassroots-style ones, with papers such as "The Big Issue" emulating mainstream papers and magazines in order to generate a large profit to invest in homeless issues and others focusing on political and social issues rather than on content that will generate money. Some street newspaper proponents believe that the primary aim of the papers should be to give homeless individuals a voice and to "fill the void" in mainstream media coverage, whereas others believe it should be to provide homeless individuals with jobs and an income.

Other frequent areas of disagreement include the extent that the homeless should participate in the writing and printing of street newspapers, and whether street newspapers should accept advertising to generate revenue. Kevin Howley sums up the division between different street newspaper models when he questions if it is "possible (or desirable for that matter) to publish a dissident newspaper—that is, a publication committed to progressive social change—and still attract a wide audience".

Tom Pryce

Thomas Maldwyn Pryce (11 June 1949 – 5 March 1977) was a British <a href="racing%20driver">racing driver</a> from Wales, famous for winning the <a href="Race%20of%20Champions%20%28Brands%20Hatch%29">Brands Hatch Race of Champions</a>, a non-championship <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> race, in 1975 and for the circumstances surrounding his death. Pryce is the only Welsh driver to have won a Formula One race and is also the only Welshman to lead a Formula One World Championship Grand Prix: two laps of the <a href="1975%20British%20Grand%20Prix">1975 British Grand Prix</a>.

Pryce started his career in Formula One with the small <a href="Token%20Racing">Token</a> team, making his only start for them at the <a href="1974%20Belgian%20Grand%20Prix">1974 Belgian Grand Prix</a>. Shortly after an impressive performance at the <a href="Formula%20Three">Formula Three</a> support race for the <a href="1974%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">1974 Monaco Grand Prix</a>, Pryce joined the <a href="Shadow%20Racing%20Cars">Shadow</a> team and scored his first points in <a href="1974%20German%20Grand%20Prix">Germany in only his fourth race</a>. Pryce later claimed two podium finishes, his first in <a href="1975%20Austrian%20Grand%20Prix">Austria in 1975</a> and the second in <a href="1976%20Brazilian%20Grand%20Prix">Brazil a year later</a>. Pryce was considered by his team as a great wet-weather driver. During the practice session for the <a href="1977%20South%20African%20Grand%20Prix">1977 South African Grand Prix</a>, run in wet conditions, Pryce was faster than everyone, including world champion drivers <a href="Niki%20Lauda">Niki Lauda</a> and <a href="James%20Hunt">James Hunt</a>. During the race, he collided at high speed with a safety marshal, Frederik Jansen van Vuuren, and both men were killed. A memorial to Pryce was unveiled in 2009 in his home town of <a href="Ruthin">Ruthin</a>.

Tom Pryce was born on 11 June 1949 in <a href="Ruthin">Ruthin</a>, <a href="Denbighshire">Denbighshire</a>, Wales, to Jack and Gwyneth Pryce. Jack had served in the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> as a tail-gunner on a <a href="Avro%20Lancaster">Lancaster bomber</a> before joining the local police force. Gwyneth was a <a href="district%20nurse">district nurse</a>. Pryce's older brother, David, died at the age of three leaving Tom an only child for much of the time he was growing up, although his parents did foster a young girl called Sandra for a while. Pryce, known to his friends as Mald, attended Nantglyn Primary School, <a href="Denbighshire%20%28historic%29">Denbighshire</a>. The family later moved to <a href="Towyn">Towyn</a>, Denbighshire, due to Jack's job.

Pryce took an interest in cars while driving a baker's van at the age of 10, before informing his parents that he wanted to be a racing driver. During an interview with <a href="Alan%20Henry">Alan Henry</a> in 1975, he stated that he had wanted to become a <a href="Pilot%20%28aeronautics%29">pilot</a>, but thought he was not intelligent enough. Like many future Formula One drivers, Pryce had a childhood racing hero. In his case it was <a href="Team%20Lotus">Lotus</a>'s Scottish driver <a href="Jim%20Clark">Jim Clark</a>. Pryce's mother recalled that he was very upset when Clark died at the <a href="Hockenheimring">Hockenheimring</a> in April 1968. His father noted that "he was very upset when <a href="Jochen%20Rindt">Jochen Rindt</a> was killed, too". After he left school at 16, Pryce's mother insisted that he take an apprenticeship as a tractor mechanic at Llandrillo Technical College, giving him "something to fall back on", as she put it, if his career as a racing driver was unsuccessful.

In 1975 Pryce married Fenella, more commonly known as Nella, whom he met at a disco in <a href="Otford">Otford</a>, <a href="Kent">Kent</a> in 1973. Following the death of her husband, Nella went on to run an antiques store in <a href="Fulham">Fulham</a>, <a href="London">London</a> with Janet Brise, the widow of <a href="Tony%20Brise">Tony Brise</a>, who died in a plane crash in 1975 with fellow racing driver, <a href="Graham%20Hill">Graham Hill</a> and later moved to France.

Tom Pryce's helmet design was, in comparison to later drivers', simple and restrained. His helmet was plain white all over until 1970. At that year's race at <a href="Castle%20Combe%20Circuit">Castle Combe</a>, his father asked Pryce to make his helmet stand out more so that he could easily identify him in a pack of cars. Pryce added five black vertical lines to his helmet, placed just above his visor. From that time the only change to this design was the addition of a <a href="Flag%20of%20Wales">Welsh flag</a> to the side of his helmet in 1974.

Pryce's first steps into motor racing came at the <a href="Mallory%20Park">Mallory Park</a> circuit in <a href="Leicestershire">Leicestershire</a> when he was 20. Pryce was put through his paces by <a href="Trevor%20Taylor%20%28racing%20driver%29">Trevor Taylor</a>, an ex-Team Lotus driver and old teammate of Pryce's childhood hero Clark. He later became a star in the <a href="Formula%205000">Formula 5000</a> series. From there, Pryce went on to compete in the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a> Crusader Championship", a series run by "Motor Racing Stables" for racing school pupils using <a href="Lotus%2051">Lotus 51</a> <a href="Formula%20Ford">Formula Ford</a> cars. Races alternated between the <a href="Brands%20Hatch">Brands Hatch</a> and <a href="Silverstone%20Circuit">Silverstone</a> circuits; Pryce made his début at the former. "The races were <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>35 a time. But I sold my <a href="Mini">Mini</a> and my parents offered all the help and encouragement I could wish for" Pryce recalled to <a href="Alan%20Henry">Alan Henry</a>.

The prize for the overall winner of the series was a Formula Ford <a href="Lola%20Cars">Lola T200</a> worth £1,500. The series was decided at the last round, held at <a href="Silverstone%20Circuit">Silverstone</a>, the day before the 1970 Formula One <a href="International%20Trophy">International Trophy</a>. Pryce qualified on the third row for the race, which was held in rain. Jack Pryce remembered that his son was rubbing his hands in delight: "he always loved racing in the rain". The early part of the race was led by a driver called Chris Smith but then heavy rain started and Pryce was able to catch up with Smith and overtake him before winning by a comfortable margin. He was given his Lola by <a href="Sir%20Max%20Aitken%2C%202nd%20Baronet">Sir Max Aitken</a>.

Pryce took his new car to Brands Hatch, where he was allowed to house it in one of the old stables at the bottom of the paddock. Pryce soon abandoned his farming career and moved to a guest house in <a href="West%20Kingsdown">West Kingsdown</a>, near the Brands Hatch circuit. Pryce continued to make a name for himself during 1971, entering a new twin-seater Sportscar category called <a href="Formula%20F100">Formula F100</a>, which he won with what was described by motorsports author <a href="David%20Tremayne">David Tremayne</a> as "embarrassing ease". He then moved up to <a href="Formula%20Super%20Vee">Formula Super Vee</a>, driving the then-choice Royale RP9, for <a href="Team%20Rumsey%20Investments">Team Rumsey Investments</a>, and soon made his <a href="Formula%20Three">Formula Three</a> début for the same manufacturer at Brands Hatch.

In that race at Brands Hatch, Pryce took an unfancied <a href="Royale%20RP11">Royale RP11</a> to first place in the Formula Three support race for the 1972 Formula One <a href="Race%20of%20Champions%20%28Brands%20Hatch%29">Race of Champions</a> against many established Formula Three drivers such as <a href="Roger%20Williamson">Roger Williamson</a>, <a href="Jochen%20Mass">Jochen Mass</a> and <a href="James%20Hunt">James Hunt</a>. So large was Pryce's advantage at the end of the race, many of the other teams voiced an opinion that Pryce's car had run the race underweight; it turned out that the circuit's weighbridge certificate had expired and everyone's cars had been underweight. Pryce retired from the leading group in the following two rounds at <a href="Oulton%20Park">Oulton Park</a> and <a href="Zandvoort">Zandvoort</a>, and then during practice for the <a href="Monaco%20Grand%20Prix%20Formula%20Three%20support%20race">support race</a> of the <a href="1972%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">1972 Monaco Grand Prix</a> his car came to a stop at "Casino Square" after a wire had come loose. He had exited his car to correct the problem when <a href="Peter%20Lamplough">Peter Lamplough</a> lost control of his car and struck the Royale RP11. Pryce was knocked into a shop window and broke a leg.

The Welshman was back in action two weeks after his incident in Monaco. Pryce also ran in the Formula SuperVee series, winning the series by a comfortable margin, "I won just about every race I went in for" Pryce recalled. A run with Royale's <a href="Formula%20Atlantic">Formula Atlantic</a> works team was also in store for Pryce during 1972, where he took <a href="pole%20position">pole position</a> for the final three rounds of the championship and won the final round at Brands Hatch.

He continued racing in Formula Atlantic in 1973, winning three races. Royale soon had plans to enter <a href="Formula%20Two">Formula Two</a>, such was the Welshman's talent. The ambition to run in the Formula Two championship was planned to be financially fuelled by a <a href="Liechtenstein">Liechtenstein</a> driver, Manfred Schurti. These plans only resulted in one of Royale's F2 cars being built before the project was scrapped and Bob King, the head of Royale, left the company.

Following an invitation to test one of his cars, Pryce found himself racing in the Formula Two series with <a href="Ron%20Dennis">Ron Dennis</a>'s "<a href="Rondel%20Racing">Rondel Racing</a>" outfit. His best result for the team came at the <a href="Norisring">Norisring</a> where he was leading the race until a brake failure meant he had to give up first place to teammate <a href="Tim%20Schenken">Tim Schenken</a>. At the end of 1973, Pryce won the <a href="Grovewood%20Award">Grovewood Award</a> for his efforts during the year. Jack Pryce recalled that his son did not want to win the award, as he thought it was "a jinx on a driver's career".

At the age of 25, Pryce graduated to Formula One, the highest category of circuit racing defined by the <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Internationale%20de%20l%27Automobile">Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile</a> (FIA), motorsport's world governing body, joining the newly formed <a href="Token%20Racing">Token Racing</a> team. The team was created by Tony Vlassopulos and Ken Grob after the original Token team closed down in 1973 due to a lack of financial backing which had led to the end of the previous "Rondel Racing" outfit. Pryce was given the seat thanks to his backing from Titan Properties, and what David Tremayne described as "evident promise". Pryce made his début for the team at the <a href="BRDC%20International%20Trophy">BRDC International Trophy</a>, a non-championship Formula One event held at Silverstone, but lack of an <a href="airbox">airbox</a> and an engine cover, along with his shortage of experience in the car, made him the slowest driver of the 16 competitors during qualifying: 26 seconds slower than James Hunt's <a href="Hesketh%20Racing">Hesketh</a> in pole position. The Welshman retired 15 laps into the race with a gear linkage problem. Pryce's World Championship début came at the <a href="1974%20Belgian%20Grand%20Prix">1974 Belgian Grand Prix</a>, where he qualified in 20th place, 3 seconds slower than the fastest time set by <a href="Clay%20Regazzoni">Clay Regazzoni</a>. Once again, he failed to finish, completing 66 laps before retiring after a collision with <a href="Jody%20Scheckter">Jody Scheckter</a>'s <a href="Tyrrell%20Racing">Tyrrell</a>.

Pryce was refused entry to the <a href="1974%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">1974 Monaco Formula One Grand Prix</a>, as he was deemed "inexperienced". Tony Vlassopulos decided to prove a point and replaced normal Formula 3 driver Buzz Buzaglo, with Pryce for the supporting <a href="Formula%20Three">Formula Three</a> race, driving for "Ippokampos Racing", in a <a href="March%20Engineering">March</a> 743, which he won by 20.8 seconds.

Following his impressive drive in Monaco, and a <a href="1974%20European%20Formula%20Two%20season">short spell</a> in <a href="Formula%20Two">Formula Two</a>, Pryce was signed by Shadow as replacement for <a href="Brian%20Redman">Brian Redman</a>, who had in turn replaced <a href="Peter%20Revson">Peter Revson</a>. Pryce made his début for the team in the <a href="1974%20Dutch%20Grand%20Prix">1974 Dutch Grand Prix</a>. He qualified in 11th position, less than 0.4 seconds slower than his teammate, <a href="Jean-Pierre%20Jarier">Jean-Pierre Jarier</a>, who was in his second full season of Formula One competition. Pryce retired on the first lap of the race after a collision with <a href="James%20Hunt">James Hunt</a> at the first corner broke his Shadow DN3's rear suspension. Pryce qualified third in his second Grand Prix for the team, in <a href="1974%20French%20Grand%20Prix">France</a>, 0.32 seconds slower than <a href="Niki%20Lauda">Niki Lauda</a>'s pole position time but nearly half a second quicker than Jarier. Once again, Pryce's race ended at the first corner, when minor contact with <a href="Carlos%20Reutemann">Carlos Reutemann</a>'s Brabham deflected Pryce's Shadow into the path of James Hunt. The second collision between the two British drivers in as many races eliminated them both. Later in the season, Pryce received 100 bottles of <a href="champagne">champagne</a> for finishing fastest in the practice session for the <a href="1974%20British%20Grand%20Prix">British Grand Prix</a> at Brands Hatch. He went on to qualify on the fourth row of the starting grid.

Pryce scored the first point of his career in the <a href="1974%20German%20Grand%20Prix">1974 German Grand Prix</a> at the challenging <a href="N%C3%BCrburgring">Nürburgring</a> circuit. After finishing 6th from 11th on the grid, he then qualified in 16th for the next Grand Prix in <a href="1974%20Austrian%20Grand%20Prix">Austria</a>, but spun off on lap 22, ending his race. He qualified in 22nd place for the <a href="1974%20Italian%20Grand%20Prix">Italian Grand Prix</a>, and finished 12 places higher. His season ended miserably, with an engine failure in <a href="1974%20Canadian%20Grand%20Prix">Canada</a>, and the Shadow severely off the pace in <a href="1974%20United%20States%20Grand%20Prix">Watkins Glen</a>. At the end of the season Pryce was equal 18th in the Drivers' Championship with <a href="Graham%20Hill">Graham Hill</a> and <a href="Vittorio%20Brambilla">Vittorio Brambilla</a>.

At the start of the <a href="1975%20Formula%20One%20season">1975 season</a>, Pryce's future was subject to much speculation. Rumour linked him with a drive at Lotus, the team run by <a href="Colin%20Chapman">Colin Chapman</a>, who had been keeping an eye on Pryce's progress throughout 1973 and 1974. At the time, Lotus was experiencing financial difficulties and reports suggested that Shadow and Lotus would swap Pryce and Swede <a href="Ronnie%20Peterson">Ronnie Peterson</a>. The trade was viewed as a good acquisition for both teams, as Pryce was considered a driver of the same ability as Peterson, but would cost Lotus less, while Peterson could attract sponsorship to the relatively new Shadow team. The deal never materialised, although Shadow team manager <a href="Alan%20Rees%20%28racing%20driver%29">Alan Rees</a> claims that it came very close to being completed.

Pryce's Shadow teammate, <a href="Jean-Pierre%20Jarier">Jean-Pierre Jarier</a>, out-qualified him in the early part of the 1975 season, as the French driver had the new <a href="Shadow%20DN5">Shadow DN5</a> car, while Pryce was in the older <a href="Shadow%20DN3">DN3</a>. It was not until the third round, the <a href="1975%20South%20African%20Grand%20Prix">South African Grand Prix</a>, that Pryce was able to use a DN5. The team's fourth race of the season was the non-championship <a href="Race%20of%20Champions%20%28Brands%20Hatch%29">Race of Champions</a> held at Brands Hatch. Pryce qualified on pole position and, following a poor start, passed Peterson and <a href="Jacky%20Ickx">Jacky Ickx</a> before closing an eight-second gap to race leader Jody Scheckter, whose engine failed while Pryce harried him, letting Pryce through to become the first Welshman to win a Formula One race. Pryce showed other signs of promise during the season, most notably in <a href="1975%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">Monaco</a> and <a href="1975%20British%20Grand%20Prix">Silverstone</a> where he qualified on the front row of the grid, the latter being in pole position. Pryce also achieved his first World Championship podium finish, in extremely wet conditions at the <a href="1975%20Austrian%20Grand%20Prix">Austrian Grand Prix</a> and finished in the points four more times. The highest of those came in <a href="1975%20German%20Grand%20Prix">Germany</a> where he finished fourth, despite the fact that while he was running second behind <a href="Carlos%20Reutemann">Carlos Reutemann</a> fuel had been leaking into the cockpit of his DN5 during the final laps around the very long <a href="N%C3%BCrburgring">Nürburgring</a>, reportedly "searing his skin and almost blinding him with fumes". The Welshman later received the "Prix Rouge et Blanc <a href="Jo%20Siffert">Jo Siffert</a> award", named after the Swiss Formula One driver, for this achievement.

At the end of December 1975, Pryce and <a href="David%20Richards%20%28racing%29">Dave Richards</a>, future head of the <a href="Prodrive">Prodrive</a> motorsports engineering company, entered a <a href="Lancia">Lancia</a> <a href="Lancia%20Stratos">Stratos</a> in the Tour of Epynt, a <a href="Rallying">rally</a> event contested by many established rallying names. Pryce needed little persuasion to team up for the one-off event on home soil with Richards, both of whom were from Ruthin. Pryce crashed into a bridge into the first stage, but still competed in the afternoon stages after his car was rebuilt.

Once the <a href="1976%20Formula%20One%20season">1976 Formula One World Championship season</a> got under way Pryce instantly added a second podium finish to his tally, at the first round in <a href="1976%20Brazilian%20Grand%20Prix">Brazil</a>. This came at the expense of continuing teammate Jarier, who was caught out by oil on the track from James Hunt's <a href="McLaren">McLaren</a>. Both Shadows enjoyed reasonable competitiveness during the next two races at <a href="1976%20South%20African%20Grand%20Prix">Kyalami</a> and <a href="1976%20United%20States%20Grand%20Prix%20West">Long Beach</a>. Changes in car regulations, meaning that teams had to lower their airboxes and mount the cars' rear wings further forward, along with revised <a href="Goodyear%20Tire%20and%20Rubber%20Company">Goodyear</a> tyres, meant the <a href="Shadow%20DN5B">Shadow DN5B</a> lost much of its competitiveness; Pryce still achieved a second points scoring finish of the season in <a href="1976%20British%20Grand%20Prix">Britain</a>. The new <a href="Shadow%20DN8">Shadow DN8</a> was not introduced until the twelfth round at <a href="1976%20Dutch%20Grand%20Prix">Zandvoort</a>, where Pryce qualified the new car in third, and finished the race only one place lower in fourth: it was the last points scoring finish of his career. The Welshman finished his last full season 12th in the Drivers' Championship with 10 points, 59 points behind World Champion James Hunt.

Jarier left Shadow before the start of the <a href="1977%20Formula%20One%20season">1977 Formula One season</a>, for <a href="ATS%20%28wheels%29">ATS</a>, and was replaced by Italian <a href="Renzo%20Zorzi">Renzo Zorzi</a>. Zorzi was later rated by <a href="Jackie%20Oliver">Jackie Oliver</a>, part of the managerial team at Shadow, as "the worst driver we [the Shadow team] ever had". The new signing brought in sponsorship from Italy, easing Shadow's financial position. Pryce started the first race of the year in <a href="1977%20Argentine%20Grand%20Prix">Argentina</a> in ninth place and stayed with the leading group until a gear linkage failure on the 45th lap of the 52 lap race. Following a long pit stop to fix the fault, he was not classified. Pryce qualified 12th for the second round in <a href="1977%20Brazilian%20Grand%20Prix">Brazil</a>, but on lap 34 retired from the race, while running in second place, as the result of an engine failure.

In 2016, in an academic paper that reported a mathematical modeling study that assessed the relative influence of driver and machine, Pryce was ranked the 28th best Formula One driver of all time.

Tom Pryce began his final race weekend, the <a href="1977%20South%20African%20Grand%20Prix">1977 South African Grand Prix</a> at <a href="Kyalami%20Grand%20Prix%20Circuit">Kyalami</a>, by setting the fastest time in the Wednesday practice session, held in wet weather. Pryce posted a time of 1 minute 31.57 seconds with the next best, the eventual 1977 World Champion <a href="Niki%20Lauda">Niki Lauda</a>, a full second slower. The weather dried up prior to the Thursday session, and he slipped back down the grid to fifteenth place, almost two seconds slower than James Hunt's pole position time.

Pryce made a poor start to the Grand Prix in his DN8 and by the end of the first lap was in last place. Pryce started to climb back up the field during the next couple of laps, overtaking <a href="Brett%20Lunger">Brett Lunger</a> and teammate <a href="Renzo%20Zorzi">Renzo Zorzi</a> on lap two, and <a href="Alex%20Ribeiro">Alex Ribeiro</a> and <a href="Boy%20Hayje">Boy Hayje</a> the following lap. By lap 18 Pryce had moved from 22nd to 13th place.

On lap 22, Zorzi pulled off to the left side of the main straight, just after the brow of a hill and a bridge over the track. He was having problems with his <a href="Air%E2%80%93fuel%20ratio%20meter">fuel metering unit</a>, and fuel was pumping directly onto the engine, which then caught fire. Zorzi did not immediately get out of his car as he could not disconnect the oxygen pipe from his helmet.

The situation caused two marshals from the pit wall on the opposite side of the track to intervene. The first marshal to cross the track was a 25-year-old <a href="panel%20beater">panel beater</a> named William (Bill). The second was 19-year-old Frederik "Frikkie" Jansen van Vuuren, who was carrying a <a href="fire%20extinguisher">fire extinguisher</a>. George Witt, the chief pit marshal for the race, said that the policy of the circuit was that in cases of fire, two marshals must attend and a further two act as back-up in case the first pair's extinguishers were not effective enough. Witt also recalled that both marshals crossed the track without prior permission. The former narrowly made it across the track, but the latter did not. As the two men started to run across the track, the cars driven by <a href="Hans-Joachim%20Stuck">Hans-Joachim Stuck</a> and Pryce came over the brow of a rise in the track.

Pryce was directly behind Stuck's car along the main straight. Stuck saw Jansen van Vuuren and moved to the right to avoid both marshals, missing Bill by what Tremayne calls "millimetres". From his position Pryce could not see Jansen van Vuuren and was unable to react as quickly as Stuck had done. He struck the teenage marshal at approximately 270 km/h (170 mph). Jansen van Vuuren was thrown into the air and landed in front of Zorzi and Bill. He died on impact, and his body was badly mutilated by Pryce's car. The fire extinguisher he had been carrying smashed into Pryce's head, before striking the Shadow's roll hoop. The force of the impact was such that the extinguisher was thrown up and over the adjacent grandstand. It landed in the car park to the rear of the stand, where it hit a parked car and jammed its door shut.

The impact with the fire extinguisher wrenched Pryce's helmet upward sharply. Death was almost certainly instantaneous. Pryce's Shadow DN8, now with its driver dead at the wheel, continued at speed down the main straight towards the first corner, called "Crowthorne". The car left the track to the right, scraping the metal barriers, hitting an entrance for emergency vehicles, and veering back onto the track. It then hit <a href="Jacques%20Laffite">Jacques Laffite</a>'s <a href="Equipe%20Ligier">Ligier</a>, sending both Pryce and Laffite head-on into the barriers. Jansen van Vuuren's injuries were so extensive that, initially, his body was identified only after the race director had summoned all of the race marshals and he was not among them.

The eventual race winner was Austrian Niki Lauda, his first win since his near fatal accident during the <a href="1976%20German%20Grand%20Prix">1976 German Grand Prix</a>. At first he announced it was the greatest victory of his career, but when told on the victory podium of Pryce's death, he said that "there was no joy after that".

Pryce's death, and its horrific nature, were met with great grief from all those who knew him during his career, especially his wife Nella, his parents Jack and Gwyneth and the Shadow team. His body was buried at St Bartholomew's Church in <a href="Otford">Otford</a>, near Sevenoaks, Kent, the same church where he and Nella were married two years earlier.

Pryce's performances in a Formula One car earned him much respect amongst the F1 paddock. David Tremayne named his son after the Welshman. The Tom Pryce Award, also known as the Tom Pryce Trophy, was instigated, and is given annually to Welsh personalities who have made an outstanding contribution to motoring or transport.

During its re-design the <a href="Anglesey%20Circuit">Anglesey Circuit</a> in North Wales named the Tom Pryce Straight after a request from Ruthin Town Council. Eddie Knipe, a South African living in Sevenoaks, sought permission from Nella Pryce to approach the Ruthin Town Council to commemorate her late husband. Having gained her consent and that of Tom's parents, a trust was established in 2006 under the chairmanship of <a href="David%20Richards%20%28racing%29">David Richards</a> (Prodrive, ex BAR) to create a memorial to Tom Pryce in Ruthin. Neil Dalrymple, a local artist was commissioned by Ruthin Town Council in 2008 to design an plaque and in February 2009, an auction of Formula One pit passes to fund its manufacture was announced. The memorial was unveiled on 11 June 2009, on what would have been Pryce's 60th birthday.

Juwan Howard

Juwan Antonio Howard (born February 7, 1973) is an American former professional <a href="basketball">basketball</a> player who is an assistant coach for the <a href="Miami%20Heat">Miami Heat</a> of the <a href="National%20Basketball%20Association">National Basketball Association</a> (NBA). Howard formerly played for the Heat from 2010 until 2013. A one-time <a href="NBA%20All-Star%20Game">All-Star</a> and one-time <a href="All-NBA">All-NBA</a> <a href="Power%20forward%20%28basketball%29">power forward</a>, he began his NBA career as the fifth overall pick in the <a href="1994%20NBA%20draft">1994 NBA draft</a>, selected by the <a href="Washington%20Bullets">Washington Bullets</a>. Before he was drafted, he starred as an <a href="All-American">All-American</a> on the <a href="Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball">Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team</a>. At Michigan he was part of the <a href="Fab%20Five%20%28University%20of%20Michigan%29">Fab Five</a> recruiting class of 1991 that reached the finals of the <a href="NCAA%20Division%20I%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Championship">NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship</a> in <a href="1992%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Tournament">1992</a> and <a href="1993%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Tournament">1993</a>. Howard won his first NBA championship with Miami in the <a href="2012%20NBA%20Finals">2012 NBA Finals</a> and his second NBA championship in the <a href="2013%20NBA%20Finals">2013 NBA Finals</a>.

Howard was an All-American <a href="center%20%28basketball%29">center</a> and an <a href="honors%20student">honors student</a> at <a href="Chicago%20Vocational%20Career%20Academy">Chicago Vocational Career Academy</a>. Michigan was able to sign him early over numerous competing offers and then convince others in his recruiting class to join him. The Fab Five, which included <a href="Chris%20Webber">Chris Webber</a>, <a href="Jalen%20Rose">Jalen Rose</a>, <a href="Jimmy%20King">Jimmy King</a> and <a href="Ray%20Jackson%20%28basketball%29">Ray Jackson</a>, served as regular <a href="starting%20lineup">starters</a> during their freshman and sophomore years for the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1991–92</a> and <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1992–93 Wolverines</a>. Howard was the last member of the Fab Five to remain active as a professional basketball player. Although many of the Wolverines' accomplishments from 1992 to 1998 were forfeited due to the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20basketball%20scandal">University of Michigan basketball scandal</a>, which involved booster payments to players to <a href="Money%20laundering">launder money</a> from illegal gambling, Howard's <a href="1994%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20All-Americans">1993–94 All-American</a> season continues to be recognized.

Howard has played six-and-a-half seasons (1994–2001) for the Bullets franchise (renamed the Wizards in 1997), three full seasons (2004–07) for the <a href="Houston%20Rockets">Houston Rockets</a>, two plus seasons for the Heat and shorter stints for several other teams. During his rookie year with the Bullets, he became the first player to graduate on time with his class after leaving college early to play in the NBA. After one season as an <a href="NBA%20All-Rookie%20Team">All-Rookie</a> player and a second as an All-Star and an All-NBA performer, he became the first NBA player to sign a $100 million contract. While he continued to be a productive starter, he was never again selected to play in an All-Star Game. Towards the end of his contract, he was traded at the NBA trade deadline twice to make <a href="salary%20cap">salary cap</a> room. He was most recently a regular starter during the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20NBA%20season">2005–06 NBA season</a>. In 2010, he signed with the Heat and entered his 17th NBA season, during which he reached the playoffs for the sixth time and made his first career <a href="2011%20NBA%20Finals">NBA Finals</a> appearance. He remained with the Heat the following season and won his first NBA championship during the 2012 NBA Finals. He returned to the Heat for part of the following season, and won a second championship. Howard has developed a reputation as a humanitarian for his civic commitment.

Howard's grandmother, Jannie Mae Howard, was the daughter of <a href="sharecropper">sharecropper</a>s from <a href="Belzoni%2C%20Mississippi">Belzoni, Mississippi</a>. She had four daughters by her 19th birthday, including Howard's mother Helena. Helena was an employee at a Chicago restaurant when she became pregnant with Juwan. Howard's father, Leroy Watson, had just returned from the Army to a phone company job in Chicago. The two married quickly once they realized Helena was pregnant. For Howard's first week of life, his high school junior mother kept him in a drawer at Jannie Mae's house. Helena, who was 17 years old, did not want to be restricted or burdened raising her child, so Jannie Mae adopted him. His biological father, Leroy Watson Jr., wanted to name him Leroy Watson, III, but his grandmother rejected the suggestion, insisting on Juwan Antonio Howard. Although his mother visited on occasion as he was growing up, his grandmother raised him, along with two cousins. Howard has no siblings and is not close to his biological parents; his grandmother was the primary influence in his life. He moved with her to several low-income <a href="South%20Side%2C%20Chicago">Chicago South Side</a> projects; she kept him out of trouble and away from gangs as he was growing up. One of their residences was a three-bedroom apartment on 69th Street on the South Side of Chicago. As he blossomed under his grandmother's influence and discipline, he became her "pride and joy".

Howard went to <a href="Chicago%20Vocational%20Career%20Academy">Chicago Vocational Career Academy</a>, where he went on to play three seasons of varsity basketball. Vocational had an unheated gym and no <a href="locker%20room">locker room</a>s, which required that the team dress for games in a history classroom. Nonetheless, Howard went on to be named a 1991 All-American basketball player by "<a href="Parade%20%28magazine%29">Parade</a>" magazine and won <a href="McDonald%27s%20All-American%20Game">McDonald's All American</a> honors. He was also chosen for the <a href="National%20Honor%20Society">National Honor Society</a> and served as Vocational's <a href="homecoming">homecoming</a> king. During recruiting visits by college coaches such as <a href="Illinois%20Fighting%20Illini%20men%27s%20basketball">Illinois</a>' <a href="Lou%20Henson">Lou Henson</a>, <a href="DePaul%20Blue%20Demons%20men%27s%20basketball">DePaul</a>'s <a href="Joey%20Meyer%20%28basketball%29">Joey Meyer</a> and <a href="Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball">Michigan</a>'s <a href="Steve%20Fisher">Steve Fisher</a>, Jannie Mae Howard did most of the questioning.

At the start of his sophomore year in 1988, Howard was 15 years old and already expected to be a coveted <a href="blue%20chip%20%28sports%29">blue chip</a> recruit in 1991. He was regarded as one of the best sophomore basketball players in the <a href="Chicago%20metropolitan%20area">Chicago metropolitan area</a>. He scored 26 points in a <a href="Chicago%20Public%20High%20School%20League">Chicago Public High School League</a> quarterfinal loss against a <a href="Deon%20Thomas">Deon Thomas</a>-led <a href="Simeon%20Career%20Academy">Simeon Career Academy</a> team. Vocational ended the year with a 23–7 record. Howard was a second-team selection and the only sophomore named to the league coaches' 20-man 1988–89 All-Public League team.

The summer after his sophomore year, the center attended the Nike Academic Betterment and Career Development (ABCD) camp, which was held annually in <a href="Princeton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Princeton, New Jersey</a>, during the late 1980s. There he was matched against the <a href="Shawn%20Bradley">Shawn Bradley</a>. At this camp, even though the much-taller Bradley <a href="block%20%28basketball%29">blocked</a> his shots several times, Howard established himself as one of the best junior-year <a href="Basketball%20terms%23B">big men</a> in the country. He was involved in controversy for receiving a second pair of <a href="Sneaker%20%28footwear%29">sneakers</a> at the camp because he was suspected of stealing them. Howard denied theft, but he was sent home on the last day of the six-day camp.

Howard also participated in the Bill Cronauer camp in <a href="Rensselaer%2C%20Indiana">Rensselaer, Indiana</a>, which more than 100 college coaches attended. According to the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>", he was ranked as one of the top 10 <a href="underclassmen">underclassmen</a> in the country during the camp. Howard attended other camps that summer; his goal was to overcome Thomas, who was the reigning "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" basketball player of the year, as the best big man in the state. By the time he ended his college career in 1994, Howard was drafted a full round ahead of Thomas.

As Howard entered his junior year, some sources listed him as the best junior basketball player in Illinois, while others ranked <a href="Tom%20Kleinschmidt">Tom Kleinschmidt</a> ahead of him. Taylor Bell of the "Chicago Sun-Times" noted that Howard was leaning toward playing either for DePaul or for Illinois. Howard was interested in Illinois because Thomas, whom Howard admired, had become a member of the <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20Illinois%20Fighting%20Illini%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1989–90 Fighting Illini team</a>. By the end of his junior year, league coaches named him to the first-team All-Chicago Public School League. He was selected to the "Chicago Sun-Times" All-Area team as well as the Class-AA All-State team and established himself as the top Chicago-area junior ahead of Kleinschmidt. Howard had a sub-par performance against <a href="King%20College%20Prep%20High%20School">King High School</a> in the Chicago Public School League semifinals, but the "Chicago Tribune" named him to its All-State second team. Vocational finished the year 24–7.

Howard was also an honors student. After his junior year, he was one of 10 Illinois players invited back to the Nike All-American Camp at Princeton. Others invited included Kleinschmidt, <a href="Donnie%20Boyce">Donnie Boyce</a>, <a href="William%20Gates%20%28basketball%29">William Gates</a>, <a href="Billy%20Taylor%20%28basketball%29">Billy Taylor</a>, <a href="Rashard%20Griffith">Rashard Griffith</a> and <a href="Howard%20Nathan">Howard Nathan</a>. Although Howard was considered one of the top prospects in the city of Chicago at that time, the player perceived as the best Chicago-area prospect was <a href="Glenn%20Robinson">Glenn Robinson</a> of <a href="Gary%2C%20Indiana">Gary, Indiana</a>. By this time, Howard had eliminated DePaul from consideration since Deryl Cunningham, another Chicago-area all-star who might have otherwise convinced Howard to stay in Chicago, had transferred to <a href="Kansas%20State%20Wildcats%20men%27s%20basketball">Kansas State</a>. He was considering Michigan, <a href="Michigan%20State%20Spartans%20men%27s%20basketball">Michigan State</a>, <a href="Kentucky%20Wildcats%20men%27s%20basketball">Kentucky</a>, <a href="Arizona%20Wildcats%20men%27s%20basketball">Arizona</a>, <a href="Dayton%20Flyers%20men%27s%20basketball">Dayton</a>, <a href="Marquette%20Golden%20Eagles%20men%27s%20basketball">Marquette</a> and Illinois. Howard was evaluated as the best senior basketball player at the camp; the group of players in attendance included <a href="Chris%20Webber">Chris Webber</a>, <a href="Cherokee%20Parks">Cherokee Parks</a>, Robinson and <a href="Alan%20Henderson">Alan Henderson</a>.

After being named <a href="Most%20Valuable%20Player">Most Valuable Player</a> (MVP) at the prestigious Boston Shootout and acknowledged as the leading participant at the Nike camp, Howard was mentioned as the best prospect in the country. By this time, he had dropped Michigan State and Illinois from his list of possible college destinations and had begun considering <a href="UNLV%20Runnin%27%20Rebels%20basketball">UNLV</a> as well. Following his time at the Nike camp, his household was besieged by recruiters. Howard issued the following statement: "Contact my coach. I do not want my grandmother and aunt upset about calls at all times of the day and night. I'm not the only person who lives in this house. I think my wishes should be respected. If not, when it comes time to make my decision, I'll take those things into account." Although Howard was the best performer at the camp, talent scout Bob Gibbons felt Webber and Robinson were equally talented prospects. Despite Howard's most recently listed college preferences and the fact that the team was under investigation for recruiting violations, Illinois continued pursuing Howard as its number one recruit. By the end of July 1990, Howard was projected to sign with Michigan.

During Michigan's in-home visit, Howard's grandmother treated Michigan <a href="head%20coach">head coach</a> Fisher, his assistants <a href="Mike%20Boyd%20%28basketball%29">Mike Boyd</a> and Brian Dutcher, Vocational coach Cook, Vocational assistant coach Donnie Kirskey, Lois Howard (Howard's aunt) and Howard to a <a href="soul%20food">soul food</a> dinner. Dutcher had the responsibility to contact Howard several times a week. Howard grew close to assistant coach Kirskey, often staying at his house and using his car once he got a <a href="driver%27s%20license">driver's license</a>. During the summer 1990 30-day visitation period, Dutcher watched Howard practice 28 consecutive days. Dutcher developed an understanding of the dynamics of Howard's relationship with his grandmother. While other coaches, such as <a href="Lute%20Olsen">Lute Olsen</a>, almost ignored her during the recruiting, Dutcher understood that she was the key influence on his life, and understood that Kirskey also had sway with Howard. He encouraged Fisher to hire Kirskey for a summer basketball camp that, which became the young athlete's introduction to <a href="Ann%20Arbor%2C%20Michigan">Ann Arbor, Michigan</a>.

Howard was the president of Vocational's Senior Boys' Council. In the final days before his senior season decision regarding his <a href="college%20basketball">college basketball</a> team, Howard wavered between <a href="Arizona%20State%20Sun%20Devils%20men%27s%20basketball">Arizona State</a> and Michigan. He also made an official visit to Dayton. Despite the ongoing recruiting scandal, he made an unofficial visit to Illinois, which had recruited four of the five previous Chicago Public School League Illinois Players of the Year. At the time of his decision, Howard was considered one of the top five seniors in the country, but unlike many top basketball recruits, he decided not to hold a press conference to announce his choice. Although the official signing period was set for November 14–21, 1990, he selected Michigan on November 2. Howard's grandmother died of a heart attack a few hours after he announced that he would attend Michigan, and he moved in with his high school coach, Richard Cook.

Howard averaged 26.9 points, 8.4 <a href="Rebound%20%28basketball%29">rebounds</a> and 3.4 <a href="assist%20%28basketball%29">assists</a> during his senior season, and finished in the top 10 percent of his academic class. He took Vocational to the Public League semifinals where they lost to <a href="George%20Westinghouse%20College%20Prep">Westinghouse College Prep</a>, finishing with a 25–5 record, despite his 25 points and 12 rebounds. He befriended <a href="Jimmy%20King">Jimmy King</a> when they visited Michigan on the same weekend; according to the "Chicago Tribune" Fisher Howard influenced King's decision to also enroll there. According to Clyde Travis of the "Chicago Sun-Times", Howard's verbal commitment made up for Fisher's failure to recruit <a href="Eric%20Montross">Eric Montross</a> the prior year, even though Montross' father and grandfather had played for Michigan. With <a href="Jalen%20Rose">Jalen Rose</a>, Webber, Howard and King – along with <a href="Ray%20Jackson%20%28basketball%29">Ray Jackson</a>, a less-heralded prospect – the Michigan recruiting class was considered to be the best in the nation. Some regarded the class as among the greatest recruiting classes of all time.

As a senior, Howard edged Griffith and <a href="Kiwane%20Garris">Kiwane Garris</a> for the most votes to the "Sun-Times"' annual All-Chicago Public School League boys' basketball team. He was also selected to the All-Area team and was a repeat Class-AA All-State selection. Howard, Kleinschmidt and Robinson were all selected to the 10-member first team of "Parade" magazine's 40-member high school All-America boys' basketball team. They were also chosen to play in the McDonald's All-America game. West MVP Webber posted 28 points and 12 rebounds in the game; with Howard adding 16 points, the West won 108–106. Howard also earned the Gatorade Circle of Champions' Illinois Player of the Year Award. Howard's <a href="ACT%20test">ACT test</a> score was high enough to make him eligible under <a href="Proposition%2048%20%28NCAA%29">Proposition 48</a> academic requirements to play as a freshman. Only eight of the top 25 Chicago Public School League players achieved a qualifying score on the test.

Howard matriculated to the University of Michigan and joined his fellow freshmen for the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1991–92 Michigan Wolverines</a> in forming a group that became known as the <a href="Fab%20Five%20%28University%20of%20Michigan%29">Fab Five</a>. He also joined future NBA personalities <a href="Eric%20Riley">Eric Riley</a> and <a href="Rob%20Pelinka">Rob Pelinka</a>. As Michigan celebrated <a href="Midnight%20Madness%20%28basketball%29">Midnight Madness</a> on October 15, 1991, there was already talk that at least four of the five freshmen would be starting before the season ended. (The five eventually started in a combined 304 of a possible 350 man-games among them during their first two seasons.) Early in his freshman season, Howard started in some games and came off the bench in others for the highly rated Wolverines. Over time, he won a starting role from Riley. In Michigan's first matchup against Illinois, Howard scored 13 points and denied Thomas the ball consistently enough to hold him to 8 shots. His biggest contribution in the game was getting his hand on a loose ball to force a <a href="jump%20ball">jump ball</a> with 16 seconds left and Michigan leading by only three points. In the <a href="Elite%20Eight">Elite Eight</a> round of the <a href="1992%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI%20Basketball%20Tournament">1992 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament</a>, Michigan faced a <a href="Jim%20Jackson%20%28basketball%29">Jimmy Jackson</a>-led <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Ohio%20State%20Buckeyes%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Ohio State Buckeyes</a> team that had beaten them twice during the regular season by double-digit margins. Michigan won the rematch, during which the Fab Five scored all but two of the Wolverines' points.

The victory gave the 24–8 Wolverines a berth in the <a href="final%20four">Final Four</a>, where they found themselves matched against a 29–4 <a href="Bob%20Huggins">Bob Huggins</a>-coached <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Cincinnati%20Bearcats%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Cincinnati Bearcats</a> team that averaged 83.6 <a href="point%20%28basketball%29">points</a> per game and had lost to only three teams, two of which had beaten Michigan. <a href="Nick%20Van%20Exel">Nick Van Exel</a> led Cincinnati in postseason scoring. Howard, King and Riley shaved their heads for the game. Michigan won and earned a rematch with a <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Duke Blue Devils team</a> that had beaten them by three points in overtime in December. In the initial contest, Howard had scored only four points. Entering the final game, he was averaging 11.2 points and 6.3 rebounds for the season. The day before the game, Howard had stomach cramps and fever and received fluids to combat dehydration. As a result, he was exempted from mandatory media meetings. Howard was part of a rotation with Webber and Riley that guarded the National Player of the Year, <a href="Christian%20Laettner">Christian Laettner</a>. During Laettner's first six possessions against Howard, Laettner dribbled the basketball off his foot, missed a shot, threw a pass that resulted in a <a href="turnover%20%28basketball%29">turnover</a>, <a href="traveling%20%28basketball%29">traveled</a>, threw the ball away and hit the backboard with a shot. Duke scored in its final 12 possessions of the championship game, going on a 23–6 run to win by a final margin of 71–51. Despite his condition, Howard contributed 9 points in 29 minutes. Howard earned a reputation for his quick feet, ability to grasp fundamentals, and excellent moves in the <a href="low%20post">low post</a>, but also for his 1-to-2 assist-to-turnover ratio and a high number of <a href="foul%20%28basketball%29">fouls</a>.

As his sophomore year began, media reports alleged that three Wolverines basketball players were paid $300 each to participate in a charity basketball tournament in mid-1992, during the off-season. The reports further alleged that some others, including Howard, appeared at several summer basketball camps together, which was a possible violation of NCAA rules. At the beginning of his <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1992–93 sophomore season</a>, Michigan returned its top nine scorers and began the season ranked number one in the country by the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a>. Michigan lost its second game of the season in a rematch with <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Duke</a>. Howard was described as the steadiest player on the team that season by coach Fisher. During the season, Howard purchased a million-dollar disability insurance policy approved by the NCAA under the Exceptional Student Athlete Disability Insurance Program available to student-athletes who are projected to be chosen high in the NBA, <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> (NFL), and <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> drafts.

In the semifinals of the <a href="1993%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Tournament">1993 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament</a> against <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Kentucky%20Wildcats%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Kentucky</a>, Howard contributed on offense and held <a href="Jamal%20Mashburn">Jamal Mashburn</a> in check defensively; Mashburn did not make a field goal in the last 12:36 of regulation. Sportswriter <a href="Jay%20Mariotti">Jay Mariotti</a> wrote that Howard had done "a terrific defensive job" in guarding Mashburn. The 31–4 Wolverines were matched up against the 33–4 <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">North Carolina Tar Heels</a> in the championship game; both Fisher and North Carolina head coach <a href="Dean%20Smith">Dean Smith</a> were seeking their second national title. During the championship game Howard picked up his second <a href="Personal%20foul%20%28basketball%29">personal foul</a> with 9 minutes 42 seconds remaining in the first half and was soon substituted out as the entire team dealt with an accumulation of fouls. The game would be remembered for a late <a href="technical%20foul">technical foul</a> against Webber for attempting to call a <a href="Time-out%20%28sport%29">time out</a> when the Wolverines had none left; this led to a Tar Heels victory. Over the course of the season, Howard averaged 14.6 points and 7.4 rebounds. After the season, Webber and Howard were invited to try out for the United States national basketball team that would compete at the <a href="1993%20Summer%20Universiade">1993 World University Games</a> and <a href="FIBA%20Under-21%20World%20Championship">Under-22 World Championships</a>. Howard did not make the team.

With Webber's departure for the NBA after his sophomore season, the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1993–94 Wolverines team</a> entered the season ranked fifth in the nation as it opened the season against number 13 . Since his grandmother had been born on December 25, Howard got a tattoo reading "Jannie Mae" over his heart during Christmas break. During the season, Howard contracted the <a href="chicken%20pox">chicken pox</a> in January. Michigan had a 21–6 (13–4 <a href="Big%20Ten%20Conference">Big Ten</a>) record and tied with the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20Purdue%20Boilermakers%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Purdue Boilermakers</a> for the conference lead with one game remaining. Michigan then lost (for the third time in its last four games) to a struggling team, and finished second in the Big Ten. After the season, Howard was selected as a first team All-Big-Ten member along with his teammate Rose, Purdue's Robinson, Michigan State's <a href="Shawn%20Respert">Shawn Respert</a>, and Indiana's <a href="Damon%20Bailey">Damon Bailey</a>. In the opening round of the <a href="1994%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Tournament">1994 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament</a>, Howard helped Michigan to a 78–74 overtime victory over by scoring 28 points and adding 9 rebounds before fouling out. In the second round, Howard posted 34 points and 18 rebounds to lead the team to an 84–79 victory over . Michigan faced a <a href="Joe%20Smith%20%28basketball%29">Joe Smith</a>-led in the Sweet Sixteen round. Howard scored 24 points and had 11 rebounds before fouling out with 2:49 remaining in the 78–71 victory. Howard earned the regional MVP award with a game-high 30 points and 13 rebounds in the Elite Eight round, despite collecting two fouls in the first two minutes and losing against the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20Arkansas%20Razorbacks%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Arkansas Razorbacks</a>, which had <a href="United%20States%20President">United States President</a> <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> in attendance as a vocal supporter. On April 18, Howard announced his intention to enter the <a href="1994%20NBA%20draft">1994 NBA draft</a>. The following day, Rose announced he would enter the draft as well. Howard was 37 <a href="credit%20hour">credit hour</a>s short of University of Michigan degree requirements, but said he intended to keep his promise to his grandmother that he would earn his diploma.

Howard left Michigan after being named an Associated Press third team <a href="1994%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20All-Americans">All-American</a> during his junior year, and was taken by the <a href="Washington%20Bullets">Washington Bullets</a> fifth overall in the 1994 NBA Draft. Howard was represented by <a href="David%20Falk">David Falk</a>. Although the Fab Five's games in the Final Four have since been forfeited, Howard was not among the players, which included <a href="Robert%20Traylor">Robert Traylor</a>, Webber, Rose, <a href="Maurice%20Taylor">Maurice Taylor</a>, and <a href="Louis%20Bullock">Louis Bullock</a>, called before a <a href="grand%20jury">grand jury</a> to testify in the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20basketball%20scandal">University of Michigan basketball scandal</a>. He was not implicated in the scandal. Although the NCAA sanctioned Michigan Wolverines men's basketball by forfeiting many of its records and accomplishments from 1992 to 1998, Howard's status as a 1993–94 All-American remained intact.

Entering the , the NBA players and owners had not yet agreed on the terms of a new <a href="collective%20bargaining%20agreement">collective bargaining agreement</a>, and Howard was unsigned two weeks before training camp began. He continued to train in Chicago in late September amidst rumors that his draft rights could be traded to another team. While holding out, he was rumored to be part of a trade package with the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Chicago%20Bulls%20season">Chicago Bulls</a> that included <a href="Calbert%20Cheaney">Calbert Cheaney</a> and a first-round draft choice in exchange for <a href="Scottie%20Pippen">Scottie Pippen</a>. Another rumor had Howard being packaged with <a href="Rex%20Chapman">Rex Chapman</a> and <a href="Don%20MacLean%20%28basketball%29">Don MacLean</a> for Pippen. On November 9, eleventh overall 1994 NBA draft selection <a href="Carlos%20Rogers%20%28basketball%29">Carlos Rogers</a> signed an NBA contract, making Howard the last first-round selection without a contract. He missed most of the first month of the season and resided at an <a href="O%27Hare%20Airport">O'Hare Airport</a> hotel while protracted talks continued. Howard's agent <a href="David%20Falk">David Falk</a> said that one of the main problems was that the Bullets wanted Howard to sign for a lower average salary than number six selection <a href="Sharone%20Wright">Sharone Wright</a>. The Bullets stuck to a 10-year, $30 million ($ million in dollars) offer. On November 17, Howard signed what was believed to be a 12-year, $37.5 million ($ million) contract. Howard's contract, which "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>" later said was an 11-year $36 million ($ million) deal, had an <a href="escape%20clause">escape clause</a>. Once he signed, he was reunited with Michigan teammate Webber as a member of the Bullets. Webber, who had also sat out training camp and the first eight games of the season, was traded from the to the Bullets on November 18 for <a href="Tom%20Gugliotta">Tom Gugliotta</a> and three first-round draft choices.

After Webber joined the Bullets, many thought that the two former Fab Five members would bring success to the team, coached by Lynam. The Washington front line was expected to include Webber, Howard, and <a href="Kevin%20Duckworth">Kevin Duckworth</a> and to have <a href="Gheorghe%20Mure%C8%99an">Gheorghe Mureșan</a>, a <a href="Romania">Romania</a>n center, coming off the bench. Chapman, MacLean, Cheaney, <a href="Mitchell%20Butler">Mitchell Butler</a> and <a href="Scott%20Skiles">Scott Skiles</a> were expected to provide solid perimeter play. Experts projected the Bullets as contenders for the Eastern Conference title. The Howard/Webber Bullets debut against the <a href="Boston%20Celtics">Boston Celtics</a> established new Bullets <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">television ratings</a> records for the <a href="Home%20Team%20Sports">Home Team Sports</a> network. However, the early season trade left the team in a state of confusion due to lack of familiarity, which resulted in communication difficulties on the court. Howard eventually moved into the starting lineup. As a power forward, Howard posted impressive numbers after he became a regular starter. Howard participated in the February 11, 1995, <a href="1995%20NBA%20All-Star%20Game">NBA All-Star</a> weekend events as a member of the <a href="Rising%20Stars%20Challenge">Rookie Challenge</a>. He earned second team All-Rookie honors at the end of the season. That month, he became the second Bullet (since the award's inception in 1981) and first since <a href="Jeff%20Ruland">Jeff Ruland</a> in January 1982 to be named NBA Rookie of the Month. During the month he averaged 20.1 points, 8 rebounds and 1.2 blocks in 14 games, including his first two 30-point games. The following month Howard suffered an ankle injury, missing a total of 10 games (all of which were Bullets losses). Over the course of the season, he averaged 17.0 points per game and posted 17 <a href="Double%20%28basketball%29%23Double-double">double-double</a>s in 65 games played (52 starts). He totalled 30 points or more on three separate occasions. The members of the team combined to miss a total of 317 games due to injury, and the team finished the season with a 21–61 record.

Howard became the first NBA athlete who entered the draft early and graduated with his academic class, thus fulfilling a promise he had made to his grandmother on the last day he saw her alive. He told <a href="Mitch%20Albom">Mitch Albom</a> that when he made it to the NBA, he realized how much leisure time the multimillionaire players had and decided to do something productive instead of find ways to spend his new riches. "I knew if I kept pushing it off, I'd never get it done", he said. He completed his final 32 course hours by taking summer classes in 1994 during the NBA off-season. He took correspondence classes and <a href="independent%20study">independent study</a> courses during the following season, studying on road trips and mailing in his papers from the nearest post office. In the end, he earned a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> degree in radio-television communication (with a minor in business) at Michigan. He told Albom that earning his degree made him a better example when speaking about staying in school. Although Howard had spent the prior year playing in the NBA, he returned to campus to partake in graduation ceremonies with his classmates. During the graduation, keynote speaker <a href="Marian%20Wright%20Edelman">Marian Wright Edelman</a> paid special recognition to Howard and Fab Five teammates King and Jackson, who graduated together, and noted that Howard's graduation made him a role model for children.

In the off-season, the traded Chapman, MacLean and Duckworth, and drafted <a href="Rasheed%20Wallace">Rasheed Wallace</a> in the <a href="1995%20NBA%20draft">1995 NBA draft</a>. In the preseason, the Bullets played the <a href="Detroit%20Pistons">Detroit Pistons</a> in an October game at the University of Michigan's <a href="Crisler%20Arena">Crisler Arena</a>, marking a homecoming for Howard. Webber was sidelined with a shoulder injury and missed the homecoming. Prior to the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20NBA%20season">1995–96 season</a>, the Bullets were expected to be a contender with Webber, Howard, Muresan, <a href="Mark%20Price">Mark Price</a>, and <a href="Robert%20Pack%20%28basketball%29">Robert Pack</a>. However, Webber, Price and Pack missed almost the entire year (65, 75 and 51 games respectively) because of injuries. In February, the <a href="New%20York%20Knicks">New York Knicks</a> made two trades that put them in position to bid on Howard in the 1996 free agent market. Since Falk was the agent for both <a href="Patrick%20Ewing">Patrick Ewing</a> and Howard, sportswriter <a href="Dave%20Anderson%20%28sportswriter%29">Dave Anderson</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" felt the Knicks would have a good chance at Howard in July when the free agent market began.

Howard earned his only career <a href="NBA%20All-Star%20Game">NBA All-Star Game</a> selection for the February 11, <a href="1996%20NBA%20All-Star%20Game">1996 game</a>. A "Sports Illustrated" story showed examples of him dominating games at will during that season. Howard also made news that season for his theatrics after being ejected from a February 27 game against the <a href="Charlotte%20Hornets">Charlotte Hornets</a>. He kicked a water cooler across the court and was fined $5,000 for making an obscene gesture. He concluded the season by scoring at least 20 points in his last 16 games. Howard became just the second player in Washington franchise history, after <a href="Bernard%20King">Bernard King</a>, to post back-to-back 40-point games (against <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Boston%20Celtics%20season">Boston</a> on April 17, 1996, with 40, and at <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Toronto%20Raptors%20season">Toronto</a> on April 19, 1996, with 42). The 42 points proved to be his career high. His strong finish earned him an NBA Player of the Month award for April. In spite of the injuries to key teammates, 1995–96 was Howard's best season, statistically. During the season, he finished 3rd in the NBA in minutes played, 6th in points scored and 10th in points per game (22.1). He was the Bullets' leading scorer. Over the course of the season, he accumulated 22 double-doubles in 81 games, including 6 in his last 8 games. At the end of the season, he was named to the <a href="All-NBA">All-NBA</a> team. In addition to his two 40-point performances, he posted 3 additional 30-point performances and scored at least 20 points in 56 of 81 games. Averaging 22.1 points, 8.1 rebounds and 4.4 assists, he helped the Bullets record 39 victories. This was not enough for the Bullets to make the playoffs during their ninth consecutive losing season.

After averaging 17 points per game as a rookie and more than 22 per game in his second season, Howard became a free agent when the Bullets made some salary cap transactions. The Bullets offered Howard an $89 million contract, but the <a href="Miami%20Heat">Miami Heat</a> outbid them with a seven-year deal estimated to be worth $98 to $101 million. However, according to the NBA league office, the Heat miscalculated their available salary under the <a href="salary%20cap">salary cap</a> by excluding performance bonuses for <a href="Tim%20Hardaway">Tim Hardaway</a> and <a href="P.%20J.%20Brown">P. J. Brown</a> and failing to account for the impact of renegotiating <a href="Alonzo%20Mourning">Alonzo Mourning</a>'s contract before coming to terms with Howard. The league rejected the contract on July 31 because Howard's $9 million for the <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20NBA%20season">1996–97 season</a> placed the Heat over the cap. Howard then re-signed with the Bullets on August 5. He became the first player in NBA history to sign a contract worth more than $100 million; his seven-year contract was worth $105 million. The league ruled on August 5 that the Bullets could re-sign Howard after having renounced his rights on July 15 to free up cap room to sign <a href="Tracy%20Murray">Tracy Murray</a> and <a href="Lorenzo%20Williams%20%28basketball%2C%20born%201969%29">Lorenzo Williams</a> if they forfeited their <a href="1997%20NBA%20draft">1997 NBA draft</a> first-round selection rights. The Bullets were not limited by the cap because they were re-signing their own player. The Heat pursued legal remedy in Florida state courts, seeking acknowledgment of the prior validity and superiority of their earlier contract. Although an arbitration case involving the two contracts that Howard had signed appeared likely, <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> reported that the Heat dropped their legal pursuit of Howard. The league moved for federal jurisdiction although the case remained on the docket for <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a> law professor Daniel Collins to serve as arbitrator on three issues: "1.) Did the Heat circumvent the cap in first signing Mourning?; 2.) Did the Heat miscalculate bonus money for forward P. J. Brown and guard Tim Hardaway that was not counted correctly against the cap.?; 3.) Did the Heat add an illegal performance clause to Brown's contract?." Meanwhile, the Heat's contract was protected by a <a href="temporary%20injunction">temporary injunction</a> in Florida state court, which forbade any newer contract by Howard from abrogating his Miami contract. The Heat eventually dropped their case but the team, especially head coach <a href="Pat%20Riley">Pat Riley</a>, continued to vehemently claim that their case of wrongdoing in the form of erroneous rulings by the league had been very solid. If the Heat had pursued arbitration and had been found guilty of violating the salary cap, the team could have been fined $5 million and Heat coach Riley could have been suspended for the season. By dropping their actions, the Heat avoided any possible penalties. In addition to signing free agents Murray and Williams, the Bullets traded for <a href="Rod%20Strickland">Rod Strickland</a> and <a href="Harvey%20Grant">Harvey Grant</a>.

As a statement against gun violence, Bullets owner <a href="Abe%20Pollin">Abe Pollin</a> sought to change the franchise's name. The Bullets became the after asking fans to vote on the name. Although before the <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20NBA%20season">1996–97 NBA season</a> the Bullets/Wizards were expected to make the playoffs with Webber, Howard, and Strickland, there were rumors that Webber had difficulty adjusting to being a less important part of the offensive game plan in the presence of All-Star Howard. Howard was plagued with <a href="shin%20splints">shin splints</a>, causing him to miss several preseason games. On November 11, 1996, Howard failed a sobriety test when he was caught <a href="speeding">speeding</a> and was charged with <a href="driving%20while%20intoxicated">driving while intoxicated</a>. The following month he pleaded not guilty and committed to enter an alcohol rehabilitation and education program. After Lynam coached the Bullets to a 22–24 record, he was fired and the Bullets hired <a href="Bernie%20Bickerstaff">Bernie Bickerstaff</a>, who posted a 22–13 record. Over the course of the 1996–97 season, Howard accumulated 24 double doubles in 82 games, while averaging 19.1 points and 8.1 rebounds. Although Howard averaged over 19 points per game and played all 82 games, he only scored 30 or more points twice during the regular season. The team finished its regular season with a 44–38 record but was swept in three games in the <a href="Eastern%20Conference%20%28NBA%29">Eastern Conference</a> first round by the <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20Chicago%20Bulls%20season">Chicago Bulls</a>, who went on to win their second consecutive NBA championship. The <a href="1997%20NBA%20Playoffs">1997 NBA Playoffs</a> were Howard's only NBA playoff appearance in his six-plus seasons with the Washington franchise, and he averaged 18.7 points and 6 rebounds while playing 43 minutes per game. The playoff appearance marked the franchise's first playoff appearance since the <a href="1988%20NBA%20Playoffs">1988 NBA Playoffs</a>.

The relocated from the <a href="US%20Airways%20Arena%20%28Washington%2C%20D.C.%29">US Airways Arena</a> to the <a href="MCI%20Center">MCI Center</a> for the <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20NBA%20season">1997–98 season</a>, during which Howard totaled 11 double-doubles in 64 games, while averaging 18.5 points and 8.0 rebounds. He scored between 20 and 29 points 31 times that season but failed to score 30 points in any game. Howard injured his ankle and was unable to play between February 5 and March 17. During Bickerstaff's only full season as the Washington coach, the team posted a 42–40 record.

On April 6, 1998, Melissa Reed filed a sexual assault complaint against Howard and Webber after a party at Howard's house. Lawyers for both offered different accounts. Howard's lawyer said that Reed had initiated an unspecified consensual sex act with one of the men, but Reed, who could not afford a lawyer, claimed to have entered a room with Webber before being struck and restrained prior to being sexually assaulted. Neither Howard nor Webber testified in the case, and although the accuser and approximately 40 of the party attendees appeared before a grand jury, the <a href="Montgomery%20County%2C%20Maryland">Montgomery County</a> <a href="State%27s%20Attorney">State's Attorney</a> announced that prosecution was not warranted and closed the case in May. This came just after the Wizards' general manager <a href="Wes%20Unseld">Wes Unseld</a> separated Webber and Howard on May 15 by trading Webber to the <a href="Sacramento%20Kings">Sacramento Kings</a>, receiving <a href="Mitch%20Richmond">Mitch Richmond</a> and <a href="Otis%20Thorpe">Otis Thorpe</a> in exchange. In June, Howard filed suit against Reed, seeking compensation for emotional distress for damage to his reputation and image. The accuser was absent during the proceeding and failed to respond to the lawsuit for <a href="defamation">defamation</a>. In November, Howard was awarded the $1 in <a href="compensatory%20damages">compensatory damages</a> that he sought to clear his name and $100,000 in <a href="punitive%20damages">punitive damages</a> plus legal costs.

After the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20NBA%20lockout">1998–99 NBA lockout</a>, the posted an 18–32 record in the shortened season. The team started out 13–19 under Bickerstaff and was 5–13 under <a href="Jim%20Brovelli">Jim Brovelli</a> after Bickerstaff was fired. Howard was a vocal critic of Bickerstaff throughout his tenure, stating the coach was unable to make proper in-game adjustments. Howard, who again had an ankle injury, missed the last 14 games of the season. Over the course of the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20NBA%20season">1998–99 season</a>, he posted 11 double-doubles and two 15-rebound performances in 36 games, while averaging 18.9 points and 7.0 rebounds.

During the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20NBA%20season">1999–2000 season</a>, Howard accumulated 10 double-doubles in 82 games, while averaging 14.9 points and 8.1 rebounds. The endured a 14–30 start under head coach <a href="Gar%20Heard">Gar Heard</a> before going 15–23 under Heard's replacement, <a href="Darrell%20Walker">Darrell Walker</a>. According to <a href="Sam%20Smith%20%28sportswriter%29">Sam Smith</a> from the "Chicago Tribune", Howard had become unpopular and a bit of a disappointment by his sixth season in Washington. He posted 30 points twice, including a season-high 36 in a fourth-quarter comeback to end a five-game losing streak in January. During the offseason, Howard's name surfaced in trade rumors that had him going to the New York Knicks in exchange for Ewing because the Wizards' management thought that the trade would better position the team for the 2001 free agent market. Following the season, Walker was replaced by <a href="Leonard%20Hamilton">Leonard Hamilton</a>, becoming the team's sixth head coach since last making the <a href="NBA%20Playoffs">NBA Playoffs</a> four years earlier.

Although it had been five years since his only All-Star appearance, Howard was the fourth-highest-paid player in the NBA during the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20NBA%20season">2000–01 season</a>, behind <a href="Kevin%20Garnett">Kevin Garnett</a>, <a href="Shaquille%20O%27Neal">Shaquille O'Neal</a> and Mourning. Howard, along with Strickland and Richmond, were marquee names on the team under contract to earn at least $10 million. On December 31, 2000, Howard, posted his career high of 15 made free throws in a game against the . Despite the fact that the February 11, <a href="2001%20NBA%20All-Star%20Game">2001 NBA All-Star Game</a> was hosted by Washington at the MCI Center, Howard was not included on the Eastern Conference team even when it had to make two late additions (<a href="Anthony%20Mason%20%28basketball%29">Anthony Mason</a> and <a href="Latrell%20Sprewell">Latrell Sprewell</a>). According to Milton Kent of "The Baltimore Sun", not only did Howard's statistics (approximately 18 points, 7 rebounds and 2.8 assists) compare favorably to both players, but his role as his team's primary scoring option made his statistics more significant than those of Mason and Sprewell.

Jordan, who had become the Wizards' head of basketball operations the prior season, traded Howard, <a href="Obinna%20Ekezie">Obinna Ekezie</a>, and <a href="Calvin%20Booth">Calvin Booth</a> to the for Laettner, <a href="Loy%20Vaught">Loy Vaught</a>, <a href="Etan%20Thomas">Etan Thomas</a>, <a href="Hubert%20Davis">Hubert Davis</a>, <a href="Courtney%20Alexander">Courtney Alexander</a> and $3 million on February 22, 2001, at the NBA trade deadline. Jordan's move was praised for freeing up salary cap space in advance of the NBA's first season with a luxury tax. The trade served the Mavericks by giving them a new offensive weapon and enabling them to match up defensively against the <a href="NBA%20Western%20Conference">NBA Western Conference</a> power forwards such as Wallace, <a href="Tim%20Duncan">Tim Duncan</a>, <a href="Karl%20Malone">Karl Malone</a> and Webber. Washington finished the year with a 19–63 record under coach Hamilton.

During the 2000–01 season, the Mavericks finished 53–29 under coach <a href="Don%20Nelson">Don Nelson</a>. Howard provided the Mavericks with a back-to-the-basket player who moved into the starting power-forward position, enabling <a href="Dirk%20Nowitzki">Dirk Nowitzki</a> to play small forward and <a href="Shawn%20Bradley">Shawn Bradley</a> to play center. During the season, Howard tallied 16 double-doubles and five 30-point performances in 81 games, while averaging 18.0 points and 7.1 rebounds. On a team with All-Star <a href="Michael%20Finley">Michael Finley</a> and future MVPs <a href="Steve%20Nash">Steve Nash</a> and Nowitzki, Howard was the highest-paid player. On March 20, Howard blocked five shots, his career high, against the . In the <a href="2001%20NBA%20Playoffs">2001 NBA Playoffs</a>, the Mavericks advanced past the 3 games to 2 before losing to the , 4 games to 1. The Utah games marked the first time Howard played for a team that won an NBA playoff series. In the first game of the series against the Spurs, Howard slammed Spurs guard <a href="Derek%20Anderson%20%28basketball%29">Derek Anderson</a> to the floor while trying to block Anderson's layup late in the game. Anderson suffered a separated shoulder on the play, and Howard received a flagrant foul and was ejected. After the game, Howard, Spurs coach <a href="Gregg%20Popovich">Gregg Popovich</a>, and Mavs owner <a href="Mark%20Cuban">Mark Cuban</a> all said the foul was committed without malice or intent to injure Anderson. In the Mavericks' 10 playoff games, Howard totaled three double-doubles while averaging 13.4 points and 8.3 rebounds in 39.1 minutes.

During the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20NBA%20season">2001–02 season</a>, he posted 17 double-doubles and three 30-point performances in 81 games (72 starts), while averaging 14.6 points and 7.6 rebounds. This was the first time since his rookie holdout season that he did not start every game he played in. All reserve appearances occurred between November 21 and December 11, and eight of them were in consecutive games between November 21 and December 5. On January 31, he posted a career-high 16 rebounds against the .

The Mavericks traded him with <a href="Donnell%20Harvey">Donnell Harvey</a>, Hardaway and a 2002 first-round pick to the for <a href="Raef%20LaFrentz">Raef LaFrentz</a>, <a href="Avery%20Johnson">Avery Johnson</a>, Van Exel and <a href="Tariq%20Abdul-Wahad">Tariq Abdul-Wahad</a> on February 21, 2002. At the time of the trade, Howard was considered the Mavericks' best low-post defender. On March 25, 2002, he scored his 10,000th career point at <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden">Madison Square Garden</a> against the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20New%20York%20Knicks%20season">New York Knicks</a>. Howard started all 28 games that he played for the Nuggets. Don Nelson's Mavericks went to the second round of the <a href="2002%20NBA%20Playoffs">2002 NBA Playoffs</a> after trading Howard, while the Nuggets failed to make the playoffs under coaches <a href="Dan%20Issel">Dan Issel</a> and <a href="Mike%20Evans%20%28basketball%29">Mike Evans</a>. By the end of the season, Nuggets general manager Vandeweghe had cleared almost $20 million of salary cap space, leaving the team with few veterans and only Howard and <a href="Marcus%20Camby">Marcus Camby</a> as well-known players. This made the team an undesirable coaching assignment for veteran coaches. In the offseason, the Nuggets replaced Evans with the relatively unknown <a href="Jeff%20Bzdelik">Jeff Bzdelik</a>.

During a preseason game, Howard attempted to punch <a href="Al%20Harrington">Al Harrington</a> and <a href="Jermaine%20O%27Neal">Jermaine O'Neal</a>, which earned him a suspension on October 25, 2002. As a result, Howard missed the ' first two games of the regular season, and this cost him $458,000 in salary. Howard first attempted to hit Harrington late in the fourth quarter on a night when Howard had missed nine of ten shots. When O'Neal intervened, the two pushed and shoved each other before Howard started punching again. At around the same time, the University of Michigan basketball scandal investigation came to an end with many of the accomplishments of the Fab Five being rescinded through <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> sanctions. Although many of the records of the Fab Five were erased, Howard's and teammate Rose's 1994 All-American recognitions were unaffected by the scandal. During the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20NBA%20season">2002–03 regular season</a>, he accumulated 18 double-doubles, two 30-point performances, and three 15-rebound performances in 77 games, while averaging 18.4 points and 7.6 rebounds. The 2002–03 Nuggets were 17–65 under Bzdelik. The team struggled with the league's lowest payroll and three rookies in the starting lineup. Howard started all 77 games in which he played.

Howard signed what was believed to be a five-year, $28 million contract as a free agent with the on July 16, 2003; he had been expected to sign with either Detroit or <a href="Minnesota%20Timberwolves">Minnesota</a>. During the season, teammate <a href="Tracy%20McGrady">Tracy McGrady</a> successfully defended his <a href="List%20of%20National%20Basketball%20Association%20annual%20scoring%20leaders">scoring championship</a>, while Howard attempted to be a positive influence when the situation arose, such as when he attempted to stop McGrady from kicking the <a href="basketball%20%28ball%29">basketball</a> into the stands twice in a row. McGrady missed the last 10 games of the season with knee problems (ending his season on March 24), leading to Howard's best performances of the season: Howard had 33 points and 11 rebounds on April 2 against the , and he had 38 points on April 12 against the . Over the course of the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20NBA%20season">2003–04 season</a>, he had 16 double-doubles and two 30-point performances in 81 games (77 starts), while averaging 17.2 points and 7.1 rebounds. The team compiled a 21–61 record, the worst in the NBA, under coaches <a href="Doc%20Rivers">Doc Rivers</a> and <a href="Johnny%20Davis%20%28basketball%29">Johnny Davis</a>.

On June 29, 2004, Howard and Magic teammates McGrady, <a href="Tyronn%20Lue">Tyronn Lue</a> and <a href="Reece%20Gaines">Reece Gaines</a> were part of a seven-player trade that sent <a href="starting%20lineup">starting</a> guards <a href="Steve%20Francis">Steve Francis</a> and <a href="Cuttino%20Mobley">Cuttino Mobley</a>, plus <a href="Kelvin%20Cato">Kelvin Cato</a>, to the Magic. In late November, as a short term experiment, head coach <a href="Jeff%20Van%20Gundy">Jeff Van Gundy</a> decided to reduce Howard's playing time so that <a href="Scott%20Padgett">Scott Padgett</a> could move up in the rotation to backup power forward. Meanwhile, <a href="Maurice%20Taylor">Maurice Taylor</a> started the first 16 games of the season for the at power forward. Van Gundy was unsatisfied with his power forward rotation, so he made the first starting lineup change of the season not mandated by injury by putting Howard into the starting lineup ahead of Taylor. Although Taylor was available and played, Howard became the regular starter on December 2 and started for the rest of the season, and the team traded Taylor before the trade deadline in February.

The 2004–05 Rockets were 51–31 under Van Gundy and lost in the first round of the <a href="2005%20NBA%20Playoffs">2005 NBA Playoffs</a> to the , four games to three. Although the Rockets made the playoffs, Howard's season ended on March 14, when he left a game with a sprained <a href="medial%20collateral%20ligament">medial collateral ligament</a> (MCL) in his right knee. Initially, the injury was supposed to sideline Howard for four weeks. The injury coincided with a period in which he developed symptoms of <a href="viral%20myocarditis">viral myocarditis</a>, including heart <a href="palpitation">palpitation</a>s, mild chest pains and fever and was diagnosed with a viral infection in his heart. His limited physical activity impaired his MCL rehabilitation. Over the course of the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20NBA%20season">2004–05 season</a>, Howard achieved seven double-doubles in 61 games (47 starts), while averaging 9.6 points and 5.7 rebounds. His 26.6 minutes per game marked the first season that he played less than 32 minutes per game.

During the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20NBA%20season">2005–06 season</a>, Howard recorded 10 double-doubles and two 30-point performances in 80 games (all as a starter), while averaging 11.8 points and 6.7 rebounds. He played 31.7 minutes per game, and this was the last season in which he averaged 30 minutes per game; this was also the final season in which Howard started at least half of the games in which he played. The were 34–48 under Van Gundy and missed the playoffs. Howard was suspended one game without pay in January for shoving the basketball into the face of Toronto guard <a href="Mike%20James%20%28basketball%2C%20born%201975%29">Mike James</a> in an exchange that occurred after Howard fouled James on a drive to the basket. On April 10, <a href="Yao%20Ming">Yao Ming</a> suffered a season-ending broken foot. In Yao's absence, Howard posted a season-high 31 points on April 17 against the <a href="Denver%20Nuggets">Denver Nuggets</a>.

In the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20NBA%20season">2006–07 season</a>, Howard achieved nine double-doubles in 80 games played (37 starts), while averaging 9.7 points and 5.9 rebounds. During the season, he lost the starting power forward position to <a href="Chuck%20Hayes">Chuck Hayes</a>, but got back in the starting lineup when Yao got injured. His 26.5 minutes per game marked a new career low. Howard only started 38 games, including 32 consecutive starts between December 26, 2006, and March 3, 2007, while center Yao was recovering from his fractured right leg. The 2006–07 Rockets were 52–30 under Van Gundy for the regular season. The Rockets entered the <a href="2007%20NBA%20Playoffs">2007 NBA Playoffs</a> with little experience; Howard was one of only three players on the team (along with <a href="Rafer%20Alston">Rafer Alston</a> and <a href="Dikembe%20Mutombo">Dikembe Mutombo</a>) to have previously won any NBA playoff series. Once the playoffs began, Howard served as a key reserve on the Rockets' short bench rotation that also included <a href="Luther%20Head">Luther Head</a> and Mutombo. The Rockets managed to split the first 4 games even though Head and Howard only combined to average 7.6 points, including a combined pointless 0-for-10 game three. Although Howard had a productive game five with 12 points and 6 rebounds which contributed to a Rockets victory, the team lost in the first round of the 2007 playoffs to the , four games to three. In the playoffs, reserve Howard averaged 5.0 points and 4.4 rebounds in 22.4 minutes. Although Howard was described as a consistent role player and locker-room leader, his salary continued to be perceived as outrageous by sportswriters such as the "<a href="Houston%20Chronicle">Houston Chronicle</a>" Jerome Solomon.

On June 14, 2007, Howard was traded to the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Minnesota%20Timberwolves%20season">Minnesota Timberwolves</a> for James and <a href="Justin%20Reed">Justin Reed</a>. According to ESPN, he regretted not choosing Minnesota the last time he had been a free agent and was looking forward to playing with Garnett. Soon after Howard signed with Minnesota, the team traded Garnett to the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Boston%20Celtics%20season">Boston Celtics</a>. Howard made it clear he was not interested in being on a team in Minnesota that was focused on developing young talent and consequently requested a trade once Garnett was no longer a member of the team. Howard still had $6.88 million and $7.38 million in salary owed to him over the next two seasons, which made him difficult to trade. Timberwolves owner <a href="Glen%20Taylor">Glen Taylor</a> noted that the team would attempt to accommodate his wishes but acknowledged that doing so would be difficult. On October 29, 2007, the Timberwolves <a href="NBA%20Salary%20Cap%23Waivers">waived</a> Howard after agreeing to a contractual buyout agreement worth $10 million spread over four years instead of the roughly $14.25 million ($6.88 million plus $7.38 million) that Minnesota would otherwise have owed him.

Howard agreed to terms with the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Dallas%20Mavericks%20season">Dallas Mavericks</a> on October 30, 2007, but was not able to officially sign until the next day, when he cleared waivers. Terms of the deal were not disclosed publicly. During the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20NBA%20season">2007–08 season</a>, he played in 50 games and made no starts, while averaging 1.1 points and 1.6 rebounds. In his limited role he never played more than 18 minutes and had season-highs of seven rebounds and six points. The 2007–08 Mavericks were 51–31 under coach Johnson and lost in the first round of the <a href="2008%20NBA%20Playoffs">2008 NBA Playoffs</a> to the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20New%20Orleans%20Hornets%20season">New Orleans Hornets</a> four games to one. In the playoffs, Howard only appeared for a total of 11 minutes in three games. This was the first season in Howard's career in which he did not start in a single game.

On October 3, 2008, Howard rejoined the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Denver%20Nuggets%20season">Denver Nuggets</a>, but was later released when the Nuggets made a three-for-one trade of <a href="Allen%20Iverson">Allen Iverson</a> for <a href="Chauncey%20Billups">Chauncey Billups</a>, <a href="Antonio%20McDyess">Antonio McDyess</a> and <a href="Cheikh%20Samb">Cheikh Samb</a> on November 3 that put them over the 15-man roster size limit. When he was waived, Howard was the only player on the Nuggets' roster without a guaranteed contract. Before the trade, Howard had played in three games during the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20NBA%20season">2008–09 season</a>. His appearances had all come from off the bench and lasted between 7 and 8 minutes. After Howard departed, the Nuggets went on to post a 54–28 record and reach the Western Conference finals under <a href="George%20Karl">George Karl</a>.

On December 12, 2008, he was signed by the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Charlotte%20Bobcats%20season">Charlotte Bobcats</a>. During the 2008–09 season, he played in 42 games, making two starts; Howard averaged 4.1 points and 1.8 rebounds. In his reserve role, he played more than 20 minutes five times, including four straight appearances from January 28 to February 8, and had season-highs of five rebounds and 14 points. He posted 10 or more points five times. Howard played extended minutes on January 28, the night after <a href="Gerald%20Wallace">Gerald Wallace</a> suffered a left-lung collapse and a non-displaced fracture of the fifth rib from a <a href="flagrant%20foul">flagrant foul</a> by <a href="Andrew%20Bynum">Andrew Bynum</a>; in 24 minutes of action, he scored 9 points. During Howard's streak of 20-minute appearances, he sat out one intervening game on February 6 with a toe injury. On February 8, in only his second start as a Bobcat, he played a season-high 30 minutes, 39 seconds and posted a season-high 14 points. The subsequent night, Howard was out of the lineup again with a toe injury. The 2008–09 Bobcats were 35–47 under coach <a href="Larry%20Brown%20%28basketball%29">Larry Brown</a>.

On September 17, 2009, Howard signed a one-year contract with the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Portland%20Trail%20Blazers%20season">Portland Trail Blazers</a>. On December 22, center <a href="Joel%20Przybilla">Joel Przybilla</a> injured his knee in the first quarter, allowing Howard to play additional minutes, which allowed Howard his first double-double since April 6, 2007. He had his other double-double of the 2009–10 season the next night when he made his first start of the season. All of Howard's performances with 10 rebounds or more occurred between December 22 and February 3. December 23 marked the start of 14 consecutive starting appearances and 24 starts in 26 appearances (ending on February 16) for him. Having lost Przybilla and <a href="Greg%20Oden">Greg Oden</a> for the season, Portland acquired Camby from the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Clippers">Los Angeles Clippers</a> for <a href="Steve%20Blake">Steve Blake</a> and <a href="Travis%20Outlaw">Travis Outlaw</a> on February 17 prior to the trade deadline. During the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20NBA%20season">2009–10 season</a>, he accumulated two double-doubles, played in 73 games, and made 27 starts, while averaging 6.0 points and 4.6 rebounds. The 2009–10 Trail Blazers were 50–32 under coach <a href="Nate%20McMillan">Nate McMillan</a> and lost in the first round of the <a href="2010%20NBA%20Playoffs">2010 NBA Playoffs</a> to the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Phoenix%20Suns%20season">Phoenix Suns</a>, four games to two. Howard appeared in all six games, averaging 3.3 points and 2.7 rebounds in 14.5 minutes. He played the most minutes (17:51) in game 4, when he added 8 points and 7 rebounds to help even the series.

On July 20, 2010, Howard came to terms for the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20NBA%20season">2010–11 NBA season</a> with the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Miami%20Heat%20season">Miami Heat</a> on a one-year contract for the veteran's minimum salary, which was $1,352,181. Although he was only paid the minimum by the Heat, he was in the final year of his four-year buyout from the Timberwolves. By joining the Heat, Howard joined a team that by the time of the <a href="2011%20NBA%20playoffs">2011 NBA playoffs</a>, included former champion <a href="Dwyane%20Wade">Dwyane Wade</a> as well as a group of players such as <a href="LeBron%20James">LeBron James</a> and <a href="Chris%20Bosh">Chris Bosh</a>. In March, he was featured in the documentary film "<a href="The%20Fab%20Five%20%28film%29">The Fab Five</a>", which was about his time as a Wolverine, that reignited controversy and reinvigorated the <a href="Duke%E2%80%93Michigan%20basketball%20rivalry">Duke–Michigan basketball rivalry</a>. On March 31, Howard was fined $35,000 for escalating an altercation the night before. Howard was ejected for pushing <a href="JaVale%20McGee">JaVale McGee</a>, who was attempting to break up a dispute between <a href="Zydrunas%20Ilgauskas">Zydrunas Ilgauskas</a> and <a href="John%20Wall%20%28basketball%29">John Wall</a>. For the season, Howard played 57 games for the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Miami%20Heat%20season">2010–11 Heat</a>, all as a reserve. He averaged 2.4 points and 2.1 rebounds with season highs of 18 points and 7 rebounds. The Heat reached the NBA Finals, losing to the Dallas Mavericks four games to two. Howard averaged 1.5 points and .9 rebounds per game during the postseason.
On December 10, 2011, Howard re-signed with the Heat for the same veteran's minimum salary as the year before. Howard appeared in 28 regular season games as a reserve with limited minutes. At age 39, Howard was the third-oldest active player in the league during the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20NBA%20season">2011–12 NBA season</a>, behind <a href="Kurt%20Thomas%20%28basketball%29">Kurt Thomas</a> and <a href="Grant%20Hill">Grant Hill</a>. Before Game 4 of an <a href="2012%20NBA%20playoffs">2012 NBA playoffs</a> series against the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Indiana%20Pacers%20season">Indiana Pacers</a>, Howard engaged in pregame verbal sparring with <a href="Lance%20Stephenson">Lance Stephenson</a> after Stephenson mocked Howard's teammate James. Despite this incident, Howard was a maturing influence on the team during the playoffs; according to David Neal of "<a href="The%20Miami%20Herald">The Miami Herald</a>", "More often, Howard stood as the body of reason — getting between Dwyane Wade and <a href="Erik%20Spoelstra">Spoelstra</a> against Indiana in Game 3 of the second round, pulling <a href="Mario%20Chalmers">Mario Chalmers</a> away from <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Oklahoma%20City%20Thunder%20season">Oklahoma City</a> star <a href="Kevin%20Durant">Kevin Durant</a>." On June 21, 2012, Howard became the first and only member of the Fab Five to win an NBA championship, as a role player on the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Miami%20Heat%20season">2011–12 Miami Heat</a>. Howard was on the court as time expired in the series-clinching game because the three stars of the Heat (James, Wade and Bosh) had arranged it. Howard spoke about representing the Fab Five after the Heat won the <a href="2012%20NBA%20Finals">2012 NBA Finals</a>. A teammate with the Heat was <a href="Shane%20Battier">Shane Battier</a>, who grew up in Detroit as a fan of the <a href="Fab%20Five%20%28University%20of%20Michigan%29">Fab Five</a> and idolized Howard. In his early teens, Battier sought Howard's <a href="autograph">autograph</a> on a pair of sneakers and a few years later became a part of the Duke–Michigan basketball rivalry when he turned down the local scholarship offer from Michigan to play for <a href="Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20men%27s%20basketball">Duke Blue Devils men's basketball</a>. Following the season, Howard became an unrestricted free agent. At the 20th annual <a href="ESPY%20Awards">ESPY Awards</a>, Howard and Heat teammate <a href="Mike%20Miller%20%28basketball%20player%29">Mike Miller</a> took to the stage to accept the award for Team of the Year.

On February 21, 2013, the Heat traded <a href="Dexter%20Pittman">Dexter Pittman</a> to create space on the roster to pursue a more experienced big man. On March 2, 2013, Howard signed a 10-day contract with the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Miami%20Heat%20season">2012–13 Miami Heat</a>. On March 12, 2013, he signed a second 10-day contract with the Heat, and on March 22, 2013, he was signed for the remainder of the season. He made his first appearance of the season for the Heat on March 24 against the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Charlotte%20Bobcats%20season">Charlotte Bobcats</a> tallying two points, a rebound and two assists in three minutes of play as the Heat made their way to their 26th consecutive victory. On April 15, he made his first start since April 14, 2010 as the Heat defeated the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Cleveland%20Cavaliers%20season">Cleveland Cavaliers</a> without James, Wade, Bosh, Battier, Chalmers and <a href="Udonis%20Haslem">Udonis Haslem</a> in the penultimate game of the regular season. Howard's April 17 start in the season finale against the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Orlando%20Magic%20season">Orlando Magic</a> marked Howard's 900th career start. On May 30, during halftime of game 5 of the Eastern Conference championship against the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Indiana%20Pacers%20season">Indiana Pacers</a>, Howard delivered a passionate speech that fired up the team in its clinching game. With the retirement of <a href="Grant%20Hill">Grant Hill</a> on June 1, 2013, Howard became the oldest active player in the NBA at age 40. During the playoffs, Howard did not play, but he served as a quasi-assistant coach.

In college, Howard was regarded as one of the best defensive big men in the country. According to Mariotti, he was also regarded as a "rock-solid" power forward who provided rebounds and defense, in contrast to his flamboyant teammate Webber. Fisher referred to Howard as his "<a href="Rock%20of%20Gibraltar">Rock of Gibraltar</a>". His consistency was described by "Chicago Tribune" journalist Skip Myslenski as Michigan's "ballast, steadying them on those many occasions when they wavered. And their savior, rescuing them from their many follies".

After the 1994 draft, NBA analyst <a href="Doug%20Collins%20%28basketball%29">Doug Collins</a> described Howard as a player who could "play with his back to the basket" and "shoot from about 16 feet outside" and who played "with a lot of energy and emotion". The Bullets' <a href="general%20manager">general manager</a>, <a href="John%20Nash%20%28basketball%29">John Nash</a>, who was disappointed that <a href="Jason%20Kidd">Jason Kidd</a> was no longer available at the fifth pick of the draft, told Jerry Bembry of "<a href="The%20Baltimore%20Sun">The Baltimore Sun</a>" that Howard was "as fundamentally sound as any player in the draft" and that he "[had] a discipline about his game and [used] a high level of skill and technique". Bembry said, "Not only can Howard post up, he passes effectively and is able to hit a jumper up to 17 feet", adding that he also was "an excellent position defender". Later Bembry noted that he was a power forward who was able to play center, adding that at Michigan he was "most effective playing with his back to the basket" but could also pass effectively and hit medium-range <a href="Jump%20shot%20%28basketball%29">jumpers</a>. The Bullets' head coach, <a href="Jim%20Lynam">Jim Lynam</a>, described Howard as a "complete player" and noted, "[H]e can defend you and he can score over you". Nash said that "the things that impressed me most about him were his character, his intelligence and his insight. He's a leader type."

When he first became a <a href="free%20agent">free agent</a> in 1996, Howard was described as versatile enough to play all three front-line positions (<a href="small%20forward">small forward</a>, power forward and center), and <a href="Michael%20Jordan">Michael Jordan</a> praised his "game, work ethic and character". As a Dallas player in 2000–01, he was still regarded as a versatile offensive player who could "take advantage of smaller defenders in the paint and then stretch his bigger defenders outside" in addition to being a solid rebounder. By 2001, Lacy J. Banks from the "Chicago Sun-Times" regarded him as a high-priced, under-achieving player, but in 2002, Banks described him as a solid veteran at the four (power forward position). In the NBA, Howard developed a respected inside post-up game and a reputation as a veteran leader, according to <a href="Kiki%20Vandeweghe">Kiki Vandeweghe</a>, the general manager of the <a href="Denver%20Nuggets">Denver Nuggets</a>, Howard's team in 2003.

When he signed with the Heat in 2010, Howard was lauded for his ability to play the power forward and center positions and for his professionalism. Howard also added frontcourt toughness. As an elder statesman with the Heat, he was regarded as a future NBA coach or general manager.

On September 28, 2013, the Heat announced a reshuffling of their organization. The reshuffling included the announcement that Howard would remain with the Heat, moving officially into an assistant coaching role. The assistant coaching position was available after both <a href="Chad%20Kammerer">Chad Kammerer</a> and <a href="Keith%20Askins">Keith Askins</a> were moved from coaching to scouting positions. This effectively indicated Howard's retirement as a basketball player, as league regulations prohibit one from holding a coaching position while being an active player.

Howard has remained a Chicago resident throughout his NBA career. In 1996, he bought a <a href="town%20home">town home</a> for $490,000 in the South <a href="Loop%2C%20Chicago">Loop</a> area. In 2009, he paid $2.55 million for a three-bedroom, unit in the <a href="Trump%20International%20Hotel%20and%20Tower%20%28Chicago%29">Trump International Hotel & Tower</a>. In 2005, Howard bought a $11.775 million property in South Florida's Gables Estates, where he intended to build a home, with a dock for a newly purchased <a href="yacht">yacht</a> named the Fab 5. After the Heat won the 2012 NBA championship, Howard sold the home within a week for about $10 million, but he continued to own at least one South Florida real estate property.

Howard's son, Juwan Howard Jr. (born February 5, 1992), is the child of Markita Blyden, who was runner-up for Michigan's Miss Basketball when she and her twin sister led Detroit's <a href="Murray%E2%80%93Wright%20High%20School">Murray–Wright High School</a> to the 1990 Class A state championship game. Howard, Jr. finished his senior season at Detroit's <a href="Pershing%20High%20School">Pershing High School</a> in spring 2010. As a junior, he led his high school to the <a href="Michigan%20High%20School%20Athletic%20Association">Michigan High School Athletic Association</a> state championship. As a senior, he was named first team All-State by the Associated Press and "<a href="Detroit%20Free%20Press">Detroit Free Press</a>". He played his freshman season for the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Western%20Michigan%20Broncos%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">2010–11 Western Michigan Broncos</a> before he transferred to the <a href="University%20of%20Detroit%20Mercy">University of Detroit Mercy</a> <a href="Detroit%20Titans%20men%27s%20basketball">Titans</a>. As a <a href="redshirt%20%28college%20sports%29">redshirt</a> sophomore for the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Detroit%20Titans%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">2012–13 Detroit Titans</a>, he became a regular starter and solid contributor.

On July 6, 2002, Howard married Jenine Wardally. At the time, Howard was 29 and Wardally was 27. They have two sons: Jace, who was born in late September 2001, and Jett, who is two years younger.

As a student athlete at the University of Michigan, Howard volunteered to visit patients at the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20Health%20System">University of Michigan Health System Hospitals</a> in Ann Arbor, Michigan. While juggling professional basketball duties and coursework as an NBA rookie/student-athlete, he continued to find time for charity work and hospital visits. His humanitarian works included a Stay in School Jam for 6,500 local area students that he participated in along with several teammates and R&B artist <a href="Usher%20%28entertainer%29">Usher</a>.

Howard is active in fostering youth basketball activities through the Juwan Howard Foundation, which helps underprivileged youth in Washington, D.C. and Chicago. He was recognized in 2001 as one of the "Good Guys in Sports" by "<a href="The%20Sporting%20News">The Sporting News</a>" for his civic contributions. In April 2010, Howard won the NBA Cares Community Assist Award for his community efforts, philanthropic work and charitable contributions. He runs a yearly free basketball camp for youth, which is made possible by a partnership between the Juwan Howard Foundation and the <a href="Chicago%20Public%20Schools">Chicago Public Schools</a> (CPS), Jordan Brand, <a href="Dell%20Computers">Dell Computers</a>, <a href="EMI%20Music">EMI Music</a>, <a href="Vitamin%20Water">Vitamin Water</a> and the NBA. His foundation partners with the CPS for a reading challenge; the top 300 readers, out of 30,000 annually, attend his camp. During and after his time as a member of the Heat, Howard was active in South Florida community outreach, fundraising and humanitarian efforts.

Howard appeared in the 1994 basketball film "<a href="Hoop%20Dreams">Hoop Dreams</a>". He had a small role in the television drama "<a href="The%20West%20Wing%20%28TV%20series%29">The West Wing</a>", appearing in a 1999 episode as a former <a href="Duke%20basketball">Duke basketball</a> player who served on <a href="Josiah%20Bartlet">Josiah Bartlet</a>'s <a href="President%27s%20Council%20on%20Fitness%2C%20Sports%2C%20and%20Nutrition">Council on Physical Fitness</a> and helped him win a game against his staff.

Other appearances include the August 15, 1999 "The Art of Give and Take" episode of "<a href="Arli%24%24">Arli$$</a>", the season 5 (2005) "Michigan's Fab 5" episode of "<a href="Beyond%20the%20Glory">Beyond the Glory</a>", the November 9, 1996 season 2 "Son-in-Law" episode of "<a href="Hang%20Time%20%28TV%20series%29">Hang Time</a>" and the 2011 documentary "<a href="The%20Fab%20Five%20%28film%29">The Fab Five</a>", produced by his Michigan teammate Jalen Rose.

But I'm a Cheerleader

But I'm a Cheerleader is a 1999 American <a href="Satire">satirical</a> <a href="romantic%20comedy">romantic comedy</a> film directed by <a href="Jamie%20Babbit">Jamie Babbit</a> and written by <a href="Brian%20Wayne%20Peterson">Brian Wayne Peterson</a>. <a href="Natasha%20Lyonne">Natasha Lyonne</a> stars as Megan Bloomfield, a high school cheerleader whose parents send her to a residential inpatient <a href="conversion%20therapy">conversion therapy</a> camp to cure her <a href="lesbianism">lesbianism</a>. There Megan soon comes to embrace her sexual orientation, despite the therapy, and falls in love. The supporting cast includes <a href="Melanie%20Lynskey">Melanie Lynskey</a>, <a href="Dante%20Basco">Dante Basco</a>, <a href="Eddie%20Cibrian">Eddie Cibrian</a>, <a href="Clea%20DuVall">Clea DuVall</a>, <a href="Cathy%20Moriarty">Cathy Moriarty</a>, Katrina Phillips, <a href="RuPaul">RuPaul</a>, <a href="Richard%20Moll">Richard Moll</a>, <a href="Mink%20Stole">Mink Stole</a>, <a href="Kip%20Pardue">Kip Pardue</a>, <a href="Michelle%20Williams%20%28actress%29">Michelle Williams</a>, and <a href="Bud%20Cort">Bud Cort</a>.

"But I'm a Cheerleader" was Babbit's first feature film. It was inspired by an article about conversion therapy and her childhood familiarity with rehabilitation programs. She used the story of a young woman finding her sexual identity to explore the <a href="social%20construction">social construction</a> of <a href="gender%20role">gender role</a>s and <a href="heteronormativity">heteronormativity</a>. The costume and set design of the film highlighted these themes using artificial textures in intense blues and pinks.

When it was initially rated as <a href="NC-17">NC-17</a> by the <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America">MPAA</a>, Babbit made cuts to allow it to be re-rated as <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America%20film%20rating%20system">R</a>. When interviewed in the documentary film "<a href="This%20Film%20Is%20Not%20Yet%20Rated">This Film Is Not Yet Rated</a>" Babbit criticized the MPAA for discriminating against films with gay content.

Many critics did not like the film, comparing it unfavorably with the films of <a href="John%20Waters">John Waters</a> and criticizing the colorful production design. Although the lead actors were praised for their performances, some of the characters were described as <a href="stereotype">stereotypical</a>.

Seventeen-year-old Megan (<a href="Natasha%20Lyonne">Natasha Lyonne</a>) is a sunny high school <a href="Twelfth%20grade">senior</a> who loves cheerleading and is dating a <a href="American%20football">football player</a>, Jared (Brandt Wille). She does not enjoy kissing Jared, however, and prefers looking at her fellow cheerleaders. Combined with Megan's interest in <a href="vegetarianism">vegetarianism</a> and <a href="Melissa%20Etheridge">Melissa Etheridge</a>, her family and friends suspect that she is in fact a lesbian. With the help of <a href="ex-gay">ex-gay</a> Mike (<a href="RuPaul">RuPaul</a>), they surprise her with an intervention. Following this confrontation, Megan is sent to True Directions, a <a href="reparative%20therapy">reparative therapy</a> camp which uses a five-step program (similar to <a href="Alcoholics%20Anonymous">Alcoholics Anonymous</a>' <a href="twelve-step%20program">twelve-step program</a>) to convert its campers to heterosexuality.

At True Directions, Megan meets the founder, strict disciplinarian Mary Brown (<a href="Cathy%20Moriarty">Cathy Moriarty</a>), Mary's supposedly heterosexual son Rock (<a href="Eddie%20Cibrian">Eddie Cibrian</a>), and a group of young people trying to "cure" themselves of their homosexuality. With the prompting of Mary and the other campers, Megan reluctantly agrees that she is a lesbian (step 1 of the five-step program). This fact, at odds with her traditional, religious upbringing, distresses her and she puts every effort into becoming heterosexual. Early on in her stay at True Directions, Megan discovers two of the boys, Dolph and Clayton (<a href="Dante%20Basco">Dante Basco</a> and <a href="Kip%20Pardue">Kip Pardue</a>), <a href="making%20out">making out</a>. She panics and screams, leading to their discovery by Mike. Dolph is made to leave and Clayton is punished by being forced into isolation.

The True Directions program involves the campers admitting their homosexuality (step 1), rediscovering their <a href="gender%20identity">gender identity</a> by performing stereotypically gender-associated tasks (step 2), finding the <a href="Root%20cause">root</a> of their homosexuality through family therapy (step 3), demystifying the other sex (step 4), and simulating heterosexual intercourse (step 5). Over the course of the program, Megan becomes friends with another girl at the camp, Graham (<a href="Clea%20DuVall">Clea DuVall</a>) who, though more comfortable being gay than Megan, was forced to the camp at the risk of otherwise being disowned by her family.

The True Directions kids are encouraged to rebel against Mary by two of her former students, <a href="ex-ex-gay">ex-ex-gay</a>s Larry and Lloyd (<a href="Richard%20Moll">Richard Moll</a> and <a href="Wesley%20Mann">Wesley Mann</a>), who take the campers to a local <a href="gay%20bar">gay bar</a> where Graham and Megan's relationship develops into a romance. When Mary discovers the trip, she makes them all <a href="Picketing%20%28protest%29">picket</a> Larry and Lloyd's house, carrying placards and shouting <a href="Homophobia">homophobic</a> abuse. Megan and Graham sneak away one night to have sex and begin to fall in love. When Mary finds out, Megan, now at ease with her sexual identity, is unrepentant. She is made to leave True Directions and, now homeless, goes to stay with Larry and Lloyd. Graham, afraid to defy her father, remains at the camp. Megan and Dolph, who is also living with Larry and Lloyd, plan to win back Graham and Clayton.

Megan and Dolph infiltrate the True Directions graduation ceremony where Dolph easily coaxes Clayton away. Megan entreats Graham to join them as well, but Graham nervously declines. Megan then performs a cheer for Graham and tells her that she loves her, finally winning Graham over. They drive off with Dolph and Clayton. The final scene of the film shows Megan's parents (<a href="Mink%20Stole">Mink Stole</a> and <a href="Bud%20Cort">Bud Cort</a>) attending a <a href="PFLAG">PFLAG</a> meeting to come to terms with their daughter's homosexuality.

"But I'm a Cheerleader" was Babbit's first feature film. She had previously directed two <a href="short%20subject">short films</a>, "Frog Crossing" (1996) and "<a href="Sleeping%20Beauties">Sleeping Beauties</a>" (1999), both of which were shown at the <a href="Sundance%20Film%20Festival">Sundance Film Festival</a>. She went on to direct the 2005 <a href="Thriller%20film">thriller</a> "<a href="The%20Quiet">The Quiet</a>" and the 2007 comedy "<a href="Itty%20Bitty%20Titty%20Committee">Itty Bitty Titty Committee</a>". Babbit and Sperling (as producer) secured financing from Michael Burns, then the vice president of <a href="Prudential%20Financial">Prudential Insurance</a> (now Vice Chairman of <a href="Lions%20Gate%20Entertainment">Lions Gate Entertainment</a>) after showing him the script at Sundance. According to Babbit, their one-sentence <a href="pitch%20%28filmmaking%29">pitch</a> was "Two high-school girls fall in love at a reparative therapy camp." Burns gave them an initial budget of <a href="US%24">US$</a>500,000 which was increased to US$1 million when the film went into production.

Babbit, whose mother runs a halfway house called New Directions for young people with drug and alcohol problems, had wanted to make a comedy about rehabilitation and the 12-step program. After reading an article about a man who had returned from a reparative therapy camp hating himself, she decided to combine the two ideas. With girlfriend Andrea Sperling, she came up with the idea for a feature film about a cheerleader who attends a reparative therapy camp. They wanted the main character to be a cheerleader because it is "... the pinnacle of the American dream, and the American dream of femininity." Babbit wanted the film to represent the lesbian experience from the <a href="Butch%20and%20femme">femme</a> perspective to contrast with several films of the time that represented the butch perspective (for example, "<a href="Go%20Fish%20%28film%29">Go Fish</a>" and "<a href="The%20Watermelon%20Woman">The Watermelon Woman</a>"). She also wanted to satirize both the <a href="Christian%20right">religious right</a> and the <a href="gay%20community">gay community</a>.
Not feeling qualified to write the script herself, Babbit brought in screenwriter and recent graduate of <a href="USC%20School%20of%20Cinematic%20Arts">USC School of Cinematic Arts</a> <a href="Brian%20Wayne%20Peterson">Brian Wayne Peterson</a>. Peterson had experience with reparative therapy while working at a prison clinic for <a href="sex%20offender">sex offender</a>s. He has said that he wanted to make a film that would not only entertain people, but also make people get angry and talk about the issues it raised.

Babbit says that her influences for the look and feel of the film included John Waters, <a href="David%20LaChapelle">David LaChapelle</a>, "<a href="Edward%20Scissorhands">Edward Scissorhands</a>" and <a href="Barbie">Barbie</a>.
She wanted the production and costume design to reflect the themes of the story. There is a progression from the organic world of Megan's hometown, where the dominant colors are orange and brown, to the fake world of True Directions, dominated by intense blues and pinks (which are intended to show the artificiality of <a href="Gender%20studies">gender construction</a>). According to Babbit, the <a href="Mysophobia">germaphobic</a> character of Mary Brown represents <a href="AIDS">AIDS</a> paranoia and her clean, ordered world is filled with plastic flowers, fake sky and <a href="Polyvinyl%20chloride">PVC</a> outfits. The external shots of the colorful house complete with a bright pink <a href="picket%20fence">picket fence</a> were filmed in <a href="Palmdale%2C%20California">Palmdale, California</a>.

Babbit recruited Clea DuVall, who had starred in her short film "Sleeping Beauties", to play the role of Graham Eaton. Babbit says that she was able to get a lot of the cast through DuVall, including Natasha Lyonne and <a href="Melanie%20Lynskey">Melanie Lynskey</a>. Lyonne first saw the script in the back of DuVall's car and subsequently contacted her agent about it. She had seen and enjoyed Babbit's short "Sleeping Beauties" and was eager to work with the director. She was not the first choice for the role of Megan. An unnamed actress wanted to play the part but eventually turned it down because of religious beliefs; she did not want her family to see her face on the poster. Babbit briefly considered <a href="Rosario%20Dawson">Rosario Dawson</a> as Megan but her executive producer persuaded her that Dawson, who is <a href="Hispanic%20and%20Latino%20Americans">Hispanic</a>, would not be right for the All-American character.

Babbit made a conscious effort to cast <a href="Person%20of%20color">people of color</a> for minor roles, in an effort to combat what she describes as "racism at every level of making movies." From the beginning she intended the characters of Mike (played by RuPaul), Dolph (<a href="Dante%20Basco">Dante Basco</a>) and Andre (<a href="Douglas%20Spain">Douglas Spain</a>) to be <a href="African%20American">African American</a>, <a href="Asian%20people">Asian</a> and Hispanic, respectively. She initially considered <a href="Arsenio%20Hall">Arsenio Hall</a> for the character of Mike but says that Hall was uncomfortable about playing a gay-themed role. As Mike, RuPaul makes a rare film appearance out of <a href="Drag%20%28clothing%29">drag</a>.

"But I'm a Cheerleader" is not only about sexuality, but also gender and the <a href="social%20construction">social construction</a> of <a href="gender%20role">gender role</a>s. One of the ways in which Babbit highlighted what she called the artificiality of gender construction was by using intense blues and pinks in her production and costume design. Chris Holmlund in "Contemporary American Independent Film" notes this feature of the film and calls the costumes "gender-tuned." Ted Gideonse in "<a href="Out%20%28magazine%29">Out</a>" magazine wrote that the costumes and colors of the film show how false the goals of True Directions are.

Gender roles are further reinforced by the tasks the campers have to perform in "Step 2: Rediscovering Your Gender Identity." Nikki Sullivan in "A Critical Introduction to Queer Theory" says that this rediscovery is shown to be difficult and unsuccessful rather than the natural discovery of their latent heterosexuality. Sullivan says that the film not only highlights the ways in which gender and sexuality are constructed but also takes the norms and truths about <a href="Heteronormativity">heteronormative</a> society and renders them strange or "queer." Holmlund says that Babbit makes the straight characters less normal and less likable than the gay ones. Sullivan says that this challenge of heteronormativity makes "But I'm a Cheerleader" an exemplification of <a href="queer%20theory">queer theory</a>.

When originally submitted to the <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America">Motion Picture Association of America</a> rating board, "But I'm a Cheerleader" received an <a href="NC-17">NC-17</a> rating. In order to get a commercially viable R rating, Babbit removed a two-second shot of Graham's hand sweeping Megan's clothed body, a <a href="Panning%20%28camera%29">camera pan</a> up Megan's body when she is masturbating, and a comment that Megan "ate Graham out" (slang for <a href="cunnilingus">cunnilingus</a>). Babbit was interviewed by <a href="Kirby%20Dick">Kirby Dick</a> for his 2006 documentary film "<a href="This%20Film%20Is%20Not%20Yet%20Rated">This Film Is Not Yet Rated</a>". A critique of the MPAA's rating system, it suggests that films with homosexual content are treated more stringently than those with only heterosexual content, and that scenes of female sexuality draw harsher criticism from the board than those of male sexuality. It compares this movie to "<a href="American%20Pie%20%28film%29">American Pie</a>" (also released in 1999), which features a teenage boy masturbating and was given an R rating (though "American Pie" also originally received an NC-17 rating and also required cuts to its masturbation scene to reduce its rating to R). Babbit says that she felt discriminated against for making a gay film. The film was rated as M (for mature audiences) in Australia and in New Zealand, 14A in Canada, 12 in Germany and 15 in the United Kingdom.

The film <a href="premiere">premiere</a>d on September 12, 1999 at the <a href="Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival">Toronto International Film Festival</a> and was shown in January 2000 at the <a href="Sundance%20Film%20Festival">Sundance Film Festival</a>. It went on to play at several international film festivals including the <a href="Sydney%20Gay%20and%20Lesbian%20Mardi%20Gras">Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras</a> festival and the <a href="London%20Lesbian%20and%20Gay%20Film%20Festival">London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival</a>. It first appeared in U.S. theaters on July 7, 2000, distributed by <a href="Lions%20Gate%20Entertainment">Lions Gate Entertainment</a>. <a href="Fine%20Line%20Features">Fine Line Features</a> had intended to distribute the film but dropped it two months before it was due to open following a dispute with the film's production company, <a href="Ignite%20Entertainment">Ignite Entertainment</a>. It closed after 8 weeks, with its widest release having been 115 theaters.

The film was released on <a href="DVD%20region%20code%231">Region 1</a> DVD by Lions Gate on July 22, 2002 and by <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal Studios</a> on October 3, 2002. Other than the <a href="film%20trailer">theatrical trailer</a>, it contains no extras. It was released on Region 2 DVD on June 2, 2003 by <a href="Prism%20Leisure">Prism Leisure</a>. In addition to the trailer, it features an interview with Jamie Babbit and behind the scenes footage.

"But I'm a Cheerleader" grossed <a href="United%20States%20dollar">$</a>2,205,627 in the United States and $389,589 elsewhere, giving a total of $2,595,216 worldwide. In its opening weekend, showing at four theaters, it earned $60,410 which was 2.7% of its total gross. According to <a href="Box%20Office%20Mojo">Box Office Mojo</a>, it ranked at 174 for all films released in the US in 2000 and 74 for R-rated films released that year. , its all time box-office ranking for <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a>-related films is 73.

The film was a hit with festival audiences and received <a href="standing%20ovation">standing ovation</a>s at the <a href="San%20Francisco%20International%20Lesbian%20and%20Gay%20Film%20Festival">San Francisco International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival</a>. It has been described as a favorite with gay audiences and on the <a href="art%20film">art house</a> circuit.

Initial mainstream critical response to "But I'm a Cheerleader" was mostly negative. <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> gave it a score of 38% based on 50 reviews, and <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> gave it a score of 39% based on 30 reviews. The overall theme of reviews is that it is a heartfelt film with good intentions, but that it is flawed. Some reviewers found it funny and enjoyable with "genuine laughs", however. <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> rated it three stars (of four) and wrote, it "is not a great, breakout comedy, but more the kind of movie that might eventually become a regular on the midnight cult circuit." Others found it obvious, leaden, and heavy handed.

Writing for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", <a href="Elvis%20Mitchell">Elvis Mitchell</a> described the character of Megan as a sweet heroine and Lyonne and DuVall were praised for their performances. <a href="Mick%20LaSalle">Mick LaSalle</a> called Lyonne wonderful and said that she was well matched by DuVall. Marjorie Baumgarten said that they "hit the right notes." Alexandra Mendenhall, writing for <a href="AfterEllen.com%20and%20AfterElton.com">AfterEllen.com</a> felt that the relationship between Graham and Megan, having great chemistry, does not get enough screen time. Mitchell called their love scenes "tender."
Other characters, particularly the males, were described as "offputting" and "nothing but stereotypes."

Several reviewers compared the film to those of director <a href="John%20Waters%20%28filmmaker%29">John Waters</a> but felt that it fell short of the mark. Stephanie Zacharek called it a "Waters knockoff" while Ebert said that Waters might have been ruder and more polished. Babbit says that although Waters is one of her influences, she did not want her film to have the "bite" of his. She states that whereas John Waters does not like romantic comedies, she wanted to tell a conventionally romantic story. The production design, which was important to the overall look and feel of the film, drew mixed responses. LaSalle described it as clever and eyecatching and <a href="James%20Berardinelli">James Berardinelli</a> called it a standout feature. Others found it to be gaudy, dated, cartoonish and ghastly.

Stephanie Zacharek, writing for <a href="Salon.com">Salon.com</a> said that with regard to issues of sexual orientation and homophobia, Babbit is preaching to the converted. Cynthia Fuchs, for NitrateOnline.com, agreed, stating that "no one who is phobic might recognize himself in the film" and that "the audience who might benefit most from watching it either won't see the film or won't see the point." <a href="David%20Edelstein">David Edelstein</a> said that the one sidedness of the film creates a lack of dramatic tension and calls it lazy counterpropaganda. In contrast, LaSalle said that "the picture manages to make a heartfelt statement about the difficulties of growing up gay" and <a href="Timothy%20Shary">Timothy Shary</a> said that the film openly challenges homophobia and offers support to teenaged gay viewers. Chris Holmlund said that the film shows that <a href="queer">queer</a> identity is multi-faceted, using as an example the scene where the ex-ex-gays tell Megan that there is no one way to be a lesbian.

Reviews from the <a href="List%20of%20LGBT%20periodicals">gay media</a> were more positive, and the film has undergone a critical reassessment over time as it has been understood more to have been deliberately satirical and campy, drawing on John Waters' techniques. Feminist website Autostraddle declared the film to be #1 of 100 best lesbian movies of all time in 2015. AfterEllen.com (which covers the feminist "lesbian/bi pop culture beat") has called it "one of the five best lesbian movies ever made." That site had originally called the movie's story predictable and the characters stereotypical in its initial 2007 review, with the reviewer saying the film was, overall, funny and enjoyable. "<a href="Curve%20%28magazine%29">Curve</a>" called the film an "incredible comedy" and said that Babbit has "redefined lesbian film" with this movie and her other work. Praise was not universal, however. Jan Stuart, writing for "<a href="The%20Advocate%20%28LGBT%20magazine%29">The Advocate</a>", said that although the film tries to subvert gay stereotypes, it is unsuccessful. She called it "numbingly crude" and said that the <a href="kitsch">kitsch</a> portrait of <a href="Middle%20America%20%28US%29">Middle America</a> is out of touch with today's gay teenagers.

The film won the Audience Award and the Graine de Cinéphage Award at the 2000 <a href="Cr%C3%A9teil%20International%20Women%27s%20Film%20Festival">Créteil International Women's Film Festival</a>, an annual French festival which showcases the work of female directors. Also that year it was nominated by the <a href="Political%20Film%20Society">Political Film Society</a> of America for the <a href="Political%20Film%20Society%20Awards">PFS award</a> in the categories of <a href="Political%20Film%20Society%20Award%20for%20Human%20Rights">Human Rights</a> and <a href="Political%20Film%20Society%20Award%20for%20Expos%C3%A9">Exposé</a>, but lost out to "<a href="Remember%20the%20Titans">Remember the Titans</a>" and "<a href="Before%20Night%20Falls%20%28film%29">Before Night Falls</a>", respectively.

<a href="Pat%20Irwin">Pat Irwin</a> composed the score for "But I'm a Cheerleader". The soundtrack has never been released on CD.

U.S. Route 16 in Michigan

US Highway 16 (US 16), also called Grand River Avenue for much of its length in the state, was one of the principal pre-<a href="Interstate%20Highway">Interstate</a> roads in the state of <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>. Before the creation of the <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highway%20System">United States Numbered Highway System</a> in 1926, the highway had been designated M-16. The modern route of Grand River Avenue cuts across the <a href="Lower%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Lower Peninsula</a> in a northwest–southeast fashion from near <a href="Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan">Grand Rapids</a> to <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>. Before the late 1950s and early 1960s, US 16 followed other roads between <a href="Muskegon%2C%20Michigan">Muskegon</a> and Grand Rapids, and then Grand River Avenue through <a href="Lansing%2C%20Michigan">Lansing</a> to Detroit. In the years immediately preceding the creation of the <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway System</a>, US 16 was shifted from older roads to newer freeways. Later, it was <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">co-designated</a> as an Interstate. When the gap in the freeway was filled in around Lansing, the US 16 <a href="decommissioned%20highway">designation was decommissioned</a> in the state. The freeway was then solely designated <a href="Interstate%2096">Interstate 96</a> (I-96) east of Grand Rapids and <a href="Interstate%20196">I-196</a> west of that city.

The original pathway along the Grand River Avenue corridor was an <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Indian</a> trail, a footpath used by the native population. This trail was later used by the first European settlers to the area now known as Michigan. In Detroit, Grand River is one of five major avenues (along with <a href="M-1%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">Woodward</a>, <a href="Michigan%20Avenue%20%28Michigan%29">Michigan</a>, <a href="Gratiot%20Avenue">Gratiot</a>, and <a href="Jefferson%20Avenue%20%28Detroit%29">Jefferson</a>) planned by Judge <a href="Augustus%20Woodward">Augustus Woodward</a> in 1805 that extended from <a href="Downtown%20Detroit">Downtown Detroit</a> in differing directions; Grand River Avenue extends northwesterly from the city's downtown. In the middle of the 19th century, the trail was expanded into a <a href="plank%20road">plank road</a> that formed the basis for one of the first <a href="Michigan%20Highway%20System">state trunkline highways</a> as M-16 in the early 20th century. Later, the highway was rerouted to replace M-126 and create <a href="M-104%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-104</a>. Current segments of the roadway are still part of the state highway system as sections of <a href="M-5%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-5</a>, <a href="M-11%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-11</a>, <a href="M-43%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-43</a> or <a href="Business%20routes%20of%20Interstate%2096">business loops off I-96</a>. The portion of Grand River Avenue in Detroit between I-96 and the intersection with Cass Avenue and Middle Street in Downtown Detroit is an unsigned state trunkline, sometimes referred to as <a href="Interstate%2096%20Business%20%28Detroit%2C%20Michigan%29">Old Business Spur I-96</a> (Old BS I-96).

At the time of its decommissioning, US 16 started its run through Michigan at the <a href="Grand%20Trunk%20Western%20Railroad">Grand Trunk Western Railroad</a> docks in Muskegon. The <a href="SS%20Milwaukee%20Clipper">SS "Milwaukee Clipper"</a> operated as a <a href="Roll-on/roll-off">car ferry</a> across <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Lake Michigan</a>, connecting Muskegon to <a href="Milwaukee%2C%20Wisconsin">Milwaukee, Wisconsin</a>, where US 16 continued to the west. From the docks, US 16 and <a href="M-46%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-46</a> <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">traveled concurrently</a> south and then east through downtown Muskegon. At Peck Street, US 16 turned south along <a href="U.S.%20Route%2031%20Business%20%28Muskegon%2C%20Michigan%29">Business US 31</a> (Bus. US 31). These two highways ran concurrently out of town to the south through <a href="Muskegon%20Heights%2C%20Michigan">Muskegon Heights</a> to <a href="Norton%20Shores%2C%20Michigan">Norton Shores</a>. There, the business loop ended at <a href="U.S.%20Route%2031%20in%20Michigan">US 31</a>, and US 16 joined the <a href="Interstate%20196">I-196</a> freeway headed east. (Later, the I-96 and I-196 designations west of Grand Rapids would be flipped, but at the time leading up to US 16's decommissioning in the state of Michigan, this had not yet been approved.) The I-196/US 16 freeway traveled southeast of Norton Shores through woodlands in rural <a href="Muskegon%20County%2C%20Michigan">Muskegon County</a> parallel to the former US 16 routing through <a href="Fruitport%2C%20Michigan">Fruitport</a> to <a href="Nunica%2C%20Michigan">Nunica</a> in <a href="Ottawa%20County%2C%20Michigan">Ottawa County</a>. The freeway turned more directly east in Nunica past the eastern terminus of <a href="M-104%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-104</a>, and continued through more mixed forest and grassland terrain to serve the communities of <a href="Coopersville%2C%20Michigan">Coopersville</a> and <a href="Marne%2C%20Michigan">Marne</a>.

As the freeway approached <a href="Kent%20County%2C%20Michigan">Kent County</a>, it met the western terminus of <a href="M-11%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-11</a> which was the former routing of US 16 through the <a href="Grand%20Rapids%20metropolitan%20area">Grand Rapids metropolitan area</a>. I-196/US 16 continued eastward around the north side of the metropolitan area through the suburbs of <a href="Walker%2C%20Michigan">Walker</a> and <a href="Comstock%20Park%2C%20Michigan">Comstock Park</a>. The freeway intersected the contemporaneous routing of <a href="U.S.%20Route%20131">US 131</a> along the East Beltline and curved south through the eastern edge of <a href="Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan">Grand Rapids</a> to meet the end of I-96 east of downtown. There I-196 ended and US 16 was transferred to the I-96 freeway. I-96/US 16 continued southward intersecting Cascade Road, which was previously US 16. Cascade Road east of this interchange meets the westernmost part of Grand River Avenue, which carried US 16 east continuously to <a href="Downtown%20Detroit">Downtown Detroit</a>.
<a href="M-50%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-50</a> also joined the freeway at Cascade Road headed east, and together I-96/US 16/M-50 continued through eastern Kent County. M-50 departed to the south near <a href="Lowell%2C%20Michigan">Lowell</a>, and the freeway crossed into southern <a href="Ionia%20County%2C%20Michigan">Ionia County</a>. Passing south of <a href="Portland%2C%20Michigan">Portland</a>, the freeway crossed east into <a href="Clinton%20County%2C%20Michigan">Clinton County</a>. North of <a href="Grand%20Ledge%2C%20Michigan">Grand Ledge</a>, I-96 ended and US 16 followed Wright Road off the freeway to Grand River Avenue. From there east, US 16 resumed its historic routing into the city of Lansing. Grand River Avenue carried the highway past the <a href="Lansing%20Capital%20City%20Airport">Capital City Airport</a> and east to Larch Street, where US 16 turned south along <a href="U.S.%20Route%2027%20in%20Michigan">US 27</a> north of downtown Lansing. At Saginaw Street, eastbound US 16 turned east on the <a href="one-way%20traffic">one-way street</a>, while westbound traffic ran a block north on Grand River Avenue. The two directions of travel merge at the east end of Saginaw Street in <a href="East%20Lansing%2C%20Michigan">East Lansing</a>. Grand River Avenue through East Lansing follows a tree-lined boulevard that forms the division between the campus of <a href="Michigan%20State%20University">Michigan State University</a> to the south and the rest of the city to the north. US 16 continued east in <a href="Ingham%20County%2C%20Michigan">Ingham County</a> through <a href="Okemos%2C%20Michigan">Okemos</a> and rural parts of the county through <a href="Williamston%2C%20Michigan">Williamston</a> and <a href="Webberville%2C%20Michigan">Webberville</a>.
Grand River Avenue crosses to the east into <a href="Livingston%20County%2C%20Michigan">Livingston County</a> through <a href="Fowlerville%2C%20Michigan">Fowlerville</a> to <a href="Howell%2C%20Michigan">Howell</a>. In Howell, Grand River Avenue meets Hartland Road which carries <a href="M-59%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-59</a>; the highway also met <a href="M-155%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-155</a> in downtown, which at the time provided access to the Howell State Hospital. In the approach to <a href="Brighton%2C%20Michigan">Brighton</a>, Grand River Avenue passes through rural southeast Michigan lake country. In Brighton, Grand River Avenue crossed the western end of the I-96 freeway. US 16 merged onto the freeway, and I-96/US 16 met the northern end of the <a href="U.S.%20Route%2023%20in%20Michigan">US 23</a> freeway. I-96/US 16 continued east into <a href="Oakland%20County%2C%20Michigan">Oakland County</a> through <a href="Wixom%2C%20Michigan">Wixom</a> and <a href="Novi%2C%20Michigan">Novi</a>.

Near <a href="Farmington%2C%20Michigan">Farmington</a>, I-96/US 16 continued to the southeast of the present-day I-96/<a href="Interstate%20275%20%28Michigan%29">I-275</a>/<a href="Interstate%20696">I-696</a>/<a href="M-5%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-5</a> interchange along the current M-5 freeway. Grand River Avenue through there was <a href="Interstate%2096%20Business%20%28Farmington%2C%20Michigan%29">Business Loop I-96</a> (BL I-96). The freeway ends at a junction with Grand River Avenue that also marked the end of the business loop and the eastern end of I-96 at the time. From there, US 16 continued along Grand River Avenue the rest of way into Downtown Detroit. Along that routing, it intersected <a href="U.S.%20Route%2024%20in%20Michigan">US 24</a> at Telegraph Road and <a href="M-39%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-39</a> at Southfield Road. <a href="U.S.%20Route%2012%20in%20Michigan">US 12</a> joined US 16 along Grand River Avenue at Plymouth Road. The two ran the rest of the way concurrently to <a href="Cadillac%20Square">Cadillac Square</a>. There they terminated at a common point with <a href="U.S.%20Route%2010%20in%20Michigan">US 10</a> (Woodward Avenue) and <a href="U.S.%20Route%20112">US 112</a> (Michigan Avenue). <a href="U.S.%20Route%2025%20in%20Michigan">US 25</a> ran through the square on <a href="M-85%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">Fort Street</a> and <a href="M-3%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">Gratiot Avenue</a>.

The history of Grand River Avenue, and US 16 in Michigan, dates back to before the earliest settlement of Michigan by Europeans. The route has been the basis for an Indian trail, a pathway for European settlers, a <a href="Michigan%20Highway%20System">state highway</a>, a part of the <a href="US%20Highway%20System">US Highway System</a>, and a section of the <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway System</a>.

The chief transportation routes in 1701 were the Indian footpaths that crossed the future state of Michigan; the Grand River Trail was one of these thirteen trails at the time. In 1805, Detroit created rights-of-way for the principal streets of the city, Grand River Avenue included. This street plan was devised by Augustus Woodward and others following a devastating fire in Detroit. A ten-year project to construct a <a href="plank%20road">plank road</a> between Detroit and Howell was authorized in 1820 along the Grand River Trail. Grand River Avenue was included as one of Five Great Military Roads by Governor <a href="Lewis%20Cass">Lewis Cass</a> in 1825, along with the River Road, Michigan Avenue, Woodward Avenue and Gratiot Avenue. The Grand River Road, precursor to the modern Grand River Avenue was named by Benjamin Williams, cofounder of <a href="Owosso%2C%20Michigan">Owosso</a>. The original Native American name for the river was meaning "the river that extends far off", or "far into the interior", which was translated as , the French name for the river; this name was then applied to the name of the trail that paralleled at least half of the river's length.

The opening of the <a href="Erie%20Canal">Erie Canal</a> in New York in 1826 brought new settlers to the Great Lakes region, and to the future state of Michigan. Many of these settlers began their inland journeys in Detroit. At first the Grand River Road was a "deep rutted, ditch bordered road". The road branched into two at Rouge (now <a href="Redford%2C%20Michigan">Redford</a>); the southern branch roughly followed the modern route of Grand River Avenue and the northern route ran by way of <a href="Pontiac%2C%20Michigan">Pontiac</a> along Woodward Avenue and the modern <a href="M-21%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-21</a> to the north of the Lansing area. From <a href="Bancroft%2C%20Michigan">Bancroft</a>, several trails branched off, including the northern branch of the Grand River Road and the <a href="Saginaw%20Trail">Saginaw Trail</a>. The two branches merged back together near <a href="Dewitt%2C%20Michigan">Dewitt</a> and continued west toward <a href="Ionia%2C%20Michigan">Ionia</a> and on to Grand Rapids and Newton (now <a href="Grand%20Haven%2C%20Michigan">Grand Haven</a>). The early travelers plied the road in wagons pulled by oxen or horses, and drivers charged between four and seven cents a mile (equivalent to $/100–/100/mi in ). The horses were exchanged every with the speed averaging around with few obstacles.

<a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> further aided the road in 1835 with an appropriation of $25,000 (equivalent to $ in ) for a road on of right-of-way. These improvements included removing brush and debris and the construction of bridges across the <a href="River%20Rouge%20%28Michigan%29">Rouge</a>, <a href="Shiawassee%20River">Shiawassee</a>, <a href="Red%20Cedar%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Red Cedar</a> and Grand rivers. The Grand River Road was a major route for settlers headed inland to Grand Rapids in 1836, as the shortest route for travelers coming from Detroit. An <a href="Panic%20of%201837">economic panic in 1837</a> drove settlers from New York to Michigan; these were the travelers who followed the Grand River Road. New settlements were created along the route, every or so, that distance being a good day's travel by horse. Approximately 120 wagons left Detroit each day between August and November 1843.

After statehood in 1837, Michigan assumed the costs for construction work to the Grand River Trail. At that time, about had been surveyed from Detroit westward. The new state lacked the money to continue improvements to the road, and Michigan petitioned Congress for the better part of the next decade for money to complete the work. When the state capital was moved to Lansing in 1847, an improved road was needed to the capital city. The first segments of roadway were privatized starting in 1844. In 1850, the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Legislature">Michigan State Legislature</a> established the Lansing and Howell Plank Road Company, which set about converting various Indian trails into the Lansing–Howell Plank Road, a task the company completed by 1853. At <a href="Howell%2C%20Michigan">Howell</a> the road connected with the Detroit–Howell Plank Road, establishing the first improved connection direct from the state capital to Michigan's largest metropolis. The Lansing–Detroit Plank Road was a toll road until the 1880s, and it eventually evolved into the eastern part of the modern Grand River Avenue.
By 1900, only a short stretch of the Detroit–Howell Plank Road was still made of planks; most of the other plank roads had been converted to gravel by this time. On May 13, 1913, the <a href="Michigan%20Legislature">Michigan Legislature</a> passed the "State Reward Trunk Line Highway Act" (Public Act 334 of 1913) that created the original state highway system. In that act, Grand River Avenue between Detroit and Grand Rapids was included as Division 9 of the system. The state highways were signposted starting in 1919, and on the first maps published on July 1 of that year, the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Highway%20Department">Michigan State Highway Department</a> (MSHD) had applied the M-16 number to Grand River Avenue across the state between <a href="Grand%20Haven%2C%20Michigan">Grand Haven</a> and Detroit. M-16 was rerouted in the Lansing area in 1925, running along Grand River Avenue from Grand Ledge to East Lansing. The former routing through Downtown Lansing on Michigan Avenue became part of <a href="M-39%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-39</a> and the section north of Grand Ledge was eventually redesignated <a href="M-100%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-100</a>. A second realignment moved M-16 to follow Grand River Avenue from Ionia through Ada. The former alignment became a part of <a href="M-21%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-21</a>. On August 7, 1926, the state completed paving on M-16, opening it to traffic as "the first paved highway across the state".

The M-16 designation lasted for seven years. As the states were meeting with the <a href="American%20Association%20of%20State%20Highway%20Officials">American Association of State Highway Officials</a> (AASHO, now AASHTO) to plan the <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highway%20System">United States Numbered Highway System</a>, the route of M-16 was originally planned for inclusion in <a href="U.S.%20Route%2018">US 18</a>. When the system was created on November 11, 1926, Grand River Avenue and M-16 became part of <a href="U.S.%20Highway%2016">US 16</a>.

In 1929, Allan Williams placed a picnic table on the side of the road along US 16 south of Saranac. Williams was the Ionia County engineer in charge of the various roads in the county, and that location is "what many consider to be the nation's first roadside table". The first change to the US 16 routing was made in 1933 when the highway was moved to bypass Farmington, with the old routing retained as a state highway. The next year, in 1934, M-126 was created between Nunica and Muskegon. In 1940, US 16 was rerouted to replace M-126, and the former route of US 16 between Nunica and Grand Haven was redesignated <a href="M-104%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-104</a>. Two further changes during 1941–42 rerouted the western end in Muskegon to end at the <a href="Roll-on/roll-off">car ferry</a> docks. Previously, motorists had to navigate from the western end along other roads to the ferry connection to the rest of US 16 in Wisconsin. The second change routed Bypass US 16 (Byp. US 16) along 28th Street and Wilson (previously the South Beltline and West Beltline sections of <a href="M-114%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-114</a>) in the Grand Rapids area. The US 16 designation was moved in 1953 to replace Byp. US 16 while the former routing through downtown Grand Rapids was redesignated Business US 16 (Bus. US 16).
MSHD had plans to upgrade the US 16 corridor to freeway standards in the middle of the 20th century. The first planning map in 1947 for what later became the Interstate Highway System showed a highway in the corridor. The "General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas Designated in September 1955", showed generalized plans for the locations of Interstate Highways as designated in 1955. This also included a highway in the US 16 corridor. The 1957 approval for the Interstate Highway System replaced the Grand Rapids–Detroit section of US 16 with a portion of Interstate 94 (I-94), with the remainder to be I-94N. MSHD submitted a recommended numbering plan for the Interstates in 1958 that showed I-96 following the US 16 corridor. When initially approved, the Muskegon–Grand Rapids segment of US 16 was to be numbered as <a href="Interstate%20196">I-196</a> while the remainder was part of I-96.

Segments of the road were upgraded in 1956 between Coopersville and Marne, Portland and Eagle, and Brighton and Farmington. By 1962, freeway construction allowed motorists to travel between Muskegon and the Lansing area on a freeway, bypassing the old Grand River Avenue route. The final connection between Lansing and Brighton was completed in late 1962. At that time, the US 16 designation, which had been applied alongside the I-96 and I-196 designations, was decommissioned. Segments of the old highway were retained in the state highway system under different numbers. Sections through Portland, Lansing, Howell, Farmington and Detroit were given Business Loop (BL) or Business Spur (BS) I-96 designations. The section between Lansing and Webberville became part of an extended <a href="M-43%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-43</a>. Other sections in the Detroit area became parts of <a href="M-102%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-102</a>, <a href="M-5%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-5</a>, or unsigned state highway.

After US 16 was transferred to the new freeway, Grand River Avenue lost its state highway status along most of its length. Today the roadway remains the "<a href="Main%20Street">Main Street</a>" of over a dozen Michigan cities and a scenic route through one of the state's most populated corridors. In 1995, major reconstruction work along Grand River Avenue in <a href="East%20Lansing%2C%20Michigan">East Lansing</a> uncovered rotting logs, buried about below the present grade, that had been used as underlayment for the plank road surface in a low, swampy area. The logs had been in place for nearly 150 years. In 2004, the state transferred several blocks at the eastern end of Grand River Avenue to the City of Detroit. State trunkline control now ends at the corner of Grand River Avenue, Middle Street, and Cass Avenue.

Community leaders in Lansing have proposed renaming a section of Grand River Avenue in Old Town Lansing for <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20Ch%C3%A1vez">César Chávez</a>, the Mexican-American civil rights activist. The group "Lansing for Cesar E. Chavez" was raising funds to rename the section between Oakland and Pine streets in Old Town. Previously, a section of Grand Avenue was renamed for Chávez in 1994, but the voters overturned the decision. The renaming proposal was even mentioned as a way to untangle a maze of different branches of Grand River Avenue running through Old Town. Currently, East Grand River Avenue and North Grand River Avenue bridge between sections of Grand River Avenue, in addition to Grand Avenue which runs along the Grand River near downtown. While Lansing's Latino community supported the proposal, the business community opposed it. One shop owner said she would have $10,000 in costs associated with a name change, adding, "I think there's many beautiful ways to honor such an incredible man. Changing five blocks of a street doesn't seem to do justice." Another business owner cited the work the Old Town Commercial Association has done to market the area using the Grand River Avenue name, marketing that would be useless after a name change. The compromise solution reached in August 2010 was to rename lot 56, where Old Town holds festivals, to Cesar Chavez Plaza. Street signs would be installed marking parts of Grand River Avenue as Cesar E. Chavez Avenue, but only in a memorial capacity; the street would still be officially named Grand River Avenue.

Born in Grand Rapids in 1884, <a href="Arthur%20H.%20Vandenberg">Arthur H. Vandenberg</a> was appointed to the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a> upon the death in office of <a href="Woodbridge%20N.%20Ferris">Woodbridge N. Ferris</a> in 1928. Vandenberg, a <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a>, served as a member of the "isolationist bloc", and was an active opponent of the <a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a> policies of <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>. The senator declined a nomination for <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">Vice President</a> in 1936. In the aftermath of World War II, Vandenberg's world view changed significantly. He helped to draft the <a href="United%20Nations%20Charter">United Nations Charter</a> and worked to secure is unanimous ratification in the Senate. He also worked to secure passage of the <a href="Marshall%20Plan">Marshall Plan</a> and helped to establish the <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Treaty%20Organization">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a>. After his death in 1951, Michigan residents wanted to memorialize Vandenberg. The following year, the <a href="Michigan%20Legislature">Michigan Legislature</a> dedicated the length of US 16 from Muskegon to Detroit as the Arthur Vandenberg Memorial Highway by enacting Public Act 70 of 1952.
Vandenberg was not the only national figure honored with a memorial designation along the route of US 16 in Michigan. For a period from the 1930s through the 1950s, the highway used a few blocks of Washington Boulevard to connect between Grand River and Michigan avenues on its route through Detroit to its terminus at <a href="Cadillac%20Square">Cadillac Square</a>. This street was named in honor of <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> for his service as the "father of his country". The street was named by Judge Woodward as a part of his general street plan for the city of Detroit in 1807.

Bypass US Highway 16 (Byp. US 16) was a <a href="bypass%20route">bypass route</a> of US 16 in the Grand Rapids area. The highway became a part of the state highway system as a part of <a href="M-114%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-114</a>, which was a beltline around the Grand Rapids area. By 1942, the trunkline was completed and reassigned a Byp. US 16 designation along the southern and western legs. The designation connected to US 16 in <a href="Walker%2C%20Michigan">Walker Township</a> (now the city of Walker) and ran south along what is now Wilson Avenue over the <a href="Grand%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Grand River</a> into <a href="Grandville%2C%20Michigan">Grandville</a>. From there it turned easterly along what is now 28th Street through <a href="Wyoming%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Wyoming</a> and <a href="Paris%20Township%2C%20Kent%20County%2C%20Michigan">Paris</a> townships (now the cities of Wyoming and Kentwood) before terminating at US 16 in <a href="Cascade%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Cascade Township</a>. The designation was used until the mainline US 16 was rerouted over the bypass in 1953.

Business US Highway 16 (Bus. US 16) was a business route in the <a href="Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan">Grand Rapids</a> area in the 1950s and 1960s. When US 16 was rerouted to replace Byp. US 16 around the southern and western sides of the city in 1953, the former route of the mainline through downtown was redesignated as the business loop. That loop followed Remembrance Avenue southeasterly to Leonard Avenue in <a href="Walker%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Walker Township</a>. From there, the loop turned easterly on Leonard over the <a href="Grand%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Grand River</a> to Monroe Avenue before turning south parallel to the river along Monroe into downtown. In downtown Grand Rapids, Bus. US 16 turned eastward on Fulton Avenue into <a href="East%20Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan">East Grand Rapids</a>. There the loop followed Cascade Road into <a href="Cascade%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Cascade Township</a> where it reconnected to US 16 at the intersection with 28th Street. Bus. US 16 lasted until 1962 when US 16 was decommissioned in Michigan.

US Highway 16A (US 16A) was an <a href="alternate%20route">alternate route</a> for US 16 that bypassed <a href="Farmington%2C%20Michigan">Farmington</a>. It was designated in 1933 for a new highway that bypassed downtown along what is now Freedom Road. In 1956, the designation was decommissioned when mainline US 16 was rerouted out of downtown Farmington, replacing US 16A. At the same time, the former route of the mainline through downtown was redesignated <a href="%23Farmington%20business%20loop">Bus. US 16</a>.

Business US Highway 16 (Bus. US 16) was a business loop through downtown <a href="Farmington%2C%20Michigan">Farmington</a> along Grand River Avenue. Its western terminus was at the junction of US 16 and Grand River Avenue west of the city, and the eastern terminus was at the intersection between US 16 and Grand River Avenue southeast of Farmington. This highway was the original route of US 16 though downtown Farmington. In 1933, US 16 was routed onto a bypass route which had been constructed south of the city (the present-day Freedom Road) and the route through Farmington was retained as state trunkline. In 1956, a new bypass freeway was built just to the south of the old bypass as part of the "Brighton–Farmington Expressway" and the route through downtown was designated Bus. US 16. The original plans for I-96 called for it to replace US 16 and to run parallel to Grand River Avenue all the way from Farmington into downtown Detroit. In 1959, the Farmington bypass freeway was given the I-96 designation in addition to the US 16 moniker, and the business route was redesignated as <a href="Interstate%2096%20Business%20%28Farmington%2C%20Michigan%29">Business Loop I-96</a> two years later.

Michael Francis Egan

Michael Francis Egan (September 29, 1761 – July 22, 1814) was an Irish, later American, <a href="prelate">prelate</a> of the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>. He was born in Ireland in 1761, and joined the <a href="Franciscans">Franciscan Order</a> at a young age. He served as a priest in Rome, Ireland, and Pennsylvania and became known as a gifted preacher. In 1808, Egan was appointed the first <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Philadelphia">Bishop of Philadelphia</a>, and held that position until his death in 1814. Egan's tenure as bishop saw the construction of new churches and the expansion of the Catholic Church membership in his diocese, but much of his time was consumed by disputes with the lay trustees of his <a href="pro-cathedral">pro-cathedral</a>, <a href="St.%20Mary%27s%20Roman%20Catholic%20Church%20%28Philadelphia%29">St. Mary's Church</a> in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. He died in Philadelphia, probably of <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, in 1814.

Michael Francis Egan was born in Ireland on September 29, 1761. The exact location of his birth is disputed. Early biographers believed Egan was possibly born in <a href="Galway">Galway</a>; more recent scholarship suggests it was <a href="Limerick">Limerick</a>. He joined the <a href="Order%20of%20Friars%20Minor">Order of Friars Minor</a> (commonly known as the Franciscans) and studied at the <a href="Old%20University%20of%20Leuven">Old University of Leuven</a> and <a href="Charles%20University%20in%20Prague">Charles University in Prague</a>. Egan received <a href="minor%20orders">minor orders</a>, <a href="Subdeacon">subdiaconate</a>, and <a href="Deacon">diaconate</a> at <a href="Mechelen">Mechelen</a>, in modern-day Belgium. He was <a href="Holy%20orders">ordained</a> a <a href="Priesthood%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">priest</a>, probably in <a href="Prague">Prague</a>, in 1785 or 1786. While studying on the continent, Egan became fluent in German.

Egan advanced rapidly to positions of responsibility in the Franciscan order. He was appointed "<a href="Custos%20%28Franciscans%29">custos</a>" ("guardian") of the province of <a href="Munster">Munster</a> in Ireland in March 1787. Later that year, he was also appointed "custos" of the <a href="Pontifical%20Irish%20College">Pontifical College</a> at <a href="Sant%E2%80%99Isidoro%20a%20Capo%20le%20Case">Sant’Isidoro a Capo le Case</a>, the home of Irish Franciscans in <a href="Rome">Rome</a>. Egan remained there until 1790, when he returned to Ireland and was appointed "custos" of <a href="Ennis">Ennis</a>. He remained in Ireland until 1787 or 1788, when he may have made a visit to the United States. After several more years as a missionary in Ireland, Egan came (or returned) to the United States in 1802.

Accepting an invitation from the Catholics near <a href="Lancaster%2C%20Pennsylvania">Lancaster, Pennsylvania</a>, Egan arrived in the United States in January 1802 to serve as assistant <a href="pastor">pastor</a> to <a href="Louis%20de%20Barth">Louis de Barth</a> at <a href="Basilica%20of%20the%20Sacred%20Heart%20of%20Jesus%2C%20Conewago">Conewago Chapel</a> in <a href="Adams%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Adams County</a>. When the <a href="Pennsylvania%20General%20Assembly">state legislature</a> sat in Lancaster that year, word of Egan's preaching abilities traveled back to <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, and soon the parishioners of that city's <a href="St.%20Mary%27s%20Roman%20Catholic%20Church%20%28Philadelphia%29">St. Mary's Church</a> petitioned Bishop <a href="John%20Carroll%20%28bishop%29">John Carroll</a> of <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a> to send Egan to them. (At that time, the Bishop of Baltimore had jurisdiction over the entire <a href="Catholic%20Church%20in%20the%20United%20States">Catholic Church in the United States</a>.)

In 1803, Egan became one of the pastors of St. Mary's Church at Philadelphia. The move coincided with a <a href="yellow%20fever">yellow fever</a> outbreak in Philadelphia. Though less virulent than Philadelphia's famous <a href="Yellow%20fever%20epidemic%20of%201793">1793 outbreak of the disease</a>, there were nonetheless many deaths, and Egan presided over many funerals that year—St. Mary's had 77 interments between June and November 1803. In 1804, Egan received permission to establish a province of Franciscans in the United States for the first time, independent of the Irish Franciscans who were then supervising the American mission. Two years later, a parishioner willed Egan some land along the <a href="Yellow%20Creek%20%28Two%20Lick%20Creek%29">Yellow Creek</a> in <a href="Indiana%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Indiana County</a>, for the establishment of a Franciscan church. Due to the order's vows of poverty, Egan asked Carroll to hold the land in his name. Egan's dream was never realized, as he was unable to attract Franciscans from Europe to establish the planned church.

Egan and the trustees of St. Mary's established a singing school in 1804, with the goal of improving the quality of the choir there. The following year was consumed by another yellow fever outbreak, and Egan joined John Rossiter, the pastor of another of Philadelphia's four Catholic churches, <a href="Old%20St.%20Joseph%27s%20Church">St. Joseph's</a>, in ministering to the sick. In 1806, they worked with the parishioners of a third church, <a href="Holy%20Trinity%20Catholic%20Church%20%28Philadelphia%29">Holy Trinity</a>, to found an <a href="orphanage">orphanage</a>, as the problem of orphaned children had been made worse by the yellow fever deaths.

The Catholic population in the United States was growing, and Bishop John Carroll had for some time wished for his vast diocese to be divided into more manageable territories. On April 8, 1808, <a href="Pope%20Pius%20VII">Pope Pius VII</a> granted Carroll's request, erecting four new <a href="Episcopal%20see">sees</a> in the United States and elevating Baltimore to an archdiocese. Among the new sees was the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Philadelphia">Diocese of Philadelphia</a>, which included the states of <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="Delaware">Delaware</a> as well as the western and southern parts of <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>. Even before the diocese was created, Carroll had determined to recommend Egan for the post, writing to Rome that Egan "was truly pious, learned, religious, remarkable for his great humility, but deficient, perhaps, in firmness and without great experience in the direction of affairs".

As a result of disruptions caused by the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, the <a href="papal%20bull">papal bull</a> nominating Egan did not reach the United States until 1810. When it arrived, Egan traveled to <a href="St.%20Peter%20the%20Apostle%20Church">St. Peter's Pro-cathedral</a> in Baltimore, where he was ordained bishop by Carroll, assisted by <a href="Benedict%20Joseph%20Flaget">Benedict Joseph Flaget</a> and <a href="Jean-Louis%20de%20Cheverus">Jean-Louis de Cheverus</a>, who had been appointed to bishoprics but had not yet been consecrated. Egan chose St. Mary's to serve as his <a href="pro-cathedral">pro-cathedral</a> in Philadelphia. Even before Egan's installation, Philadelphia Catholics began to raise funds to expand the church in accordance with its new prominence in the diocese. After their ordinations, the new bishops planned a council of the American church leadership for the near future; in fact, they did not meet until 1829, long after Egan's death.

Egan's elevation to the episcopate worsened an existing conflict in the American church: the dispute over <a href="trusteeism">trusteeism</a>. In Europe, the Church owned property and directly controlled its <a href="Parish%20in%20the%20Catholic%20Church">parishes</a> through the clergy. In the United States, however, early Catholic churches were typically founded by <a href="Laity">laymen</a> who purchased the property and erected the church buildings. The laypeople accordingly demanded some control over the administration of the parish, even after the arrival of clergy from Europe who, like Egan, held the traditional view of parish organization. The dispute also had nationalist elements to it, as the heavily German parish of Holy Trinity resented the imposition of an Irish bishop instead of one of their own. When Holy Trinity's pastor left for a new assignment in <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a> in 1811, the trustees there were perturbed at Egan's temporary appointment of an Irish priest, Patrick Kenny, to lead the parish, until a German priest could be found (a German priest, Francis Roloff, was assigned the following year).

Egan's own research into the issue showed that the trustees had conveyed St. Mary's Church to the previous pastor, Robert Harding, and then to his heirs, but the trustees did not consider that property transfer to have extinguished their role in the church's leadership. By 1811, Egan's worsening health caused him to accept the assistance of two priests at St. Mary's, James Harold and his nephew, William Vincent Harold. Egan and the trustees became further embroiled in a dispute about clerical salaries, a situation possibly made worse by the decline in shipping income in the port city caused by the outbreak of the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>. Egan also came to believe the Harolds were making the situation worse by taking pro-clergy positions that were more extreme than Egan's own and by the younger Harold's scheming to be named Egan's <a href="coadjutor%20bishop">coadjutor bishop</a>. He appealed to the trustees for compromise, and offered to bring his cousin (also a priest) over from Ireland to replace the elder Harold. By 1813, Egan and the trustees had reconciled and together resolved to remove the Harolds, who agreed to resign later that year and relocate to England.

Although the main complaints between bishop and trustees were resolved, some salary disputes lingered into 1813. The conditions at St. Mary's worsened in 1814 with the election of new trustees who were more in conflict with Egan than the previous ones. Elsewhere in the diocese, Egan was more successful. In about 1811, he made his most extensive visitation of his diocese, travelling as far west as <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a> after stopping in Lancaster and <a href="Conewago%2C%20Pennsylvania">Conewago</a>. He continued to raise funds for the Catholic orphanage and opened a new parish, <a href="Sacred%20Heart%20Church%20%28Trenton%2C%20New%20Jersey%29">Sacred Heart</a>, in <a href="Trenton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Trenton, New Jersey</a>, in 1813, bringing the total number of churches in the diocese to sixteen.

Egan's health continued to decline, and he died on July 22, 1814. While 19th-century chroniclers suggest that it "may be said in all truth that Bishop Egan died of a broken heart", modern biographers believe his health troubles more closely resembled <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>. Egan was buried in St. Mary's <a href="churchyard">churchyard</a>. In 1869, after the construction of the <a href="Cathedral%20Basilica%20of%20Saints%20Peter%20and%20Paul%20%28Philadelphia%29">Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul</a> on <a href="Logan%20Circle%20%28Philadelphia%29">Logan Square</a>, his remains were removed there and reburied in a crypt along with those of his successor in the see of Philadelphia, <a href="Henry%20Conwell">Henry Conwell</a>. <a href="Conwell-Egan%20Catholic%20High%20School">Conwell-Egan Catholic High School</a> in <a href="Fairless%20Hills">Fairless Hills</a>, Pennsylvania, is named in honor of Egan and his successor.

Caroline Island

Caroline Island or Caroline Atoll (also known as Millennium Island and Beccisa Island), is the easternmost of the uninhabited <a href="coral%20atoll">coral atoll</a>s which comprise the southern <a href="Line%20Islands">Line Islands</a> in the central <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>.

First sighted by Europeans in 1606, claimed by the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">United Kingdom</a> in 1868, and part of the <a href="Kiribati">Republic of Kiribati</a> since the island nation's independence in 1979, Caroline Island has remained relatively untouched and is considered one of the world's most pristine <a href="tropics">tropical</a> islands, despite <a href="guano">guano</a> mining, <a href="copra">copra</a> harvesting, and human habitation in the 19th and 20th centuries. It is home to one of the world's largest populations of the <a href="coconut%20crab">coconut crab</a> and is an important breeding site for <a href="seabird">seabird</a>s, most notably the <a href="sooty%20tern">sooty tern</a>.

The atoll is currently designated as a wildlife sanctuary. In 2014 the Kiribati government established a 12-nautical-mile fishing exclusion zone around each of the southern Line Islands (Caroline (commonly called Millennium), Flint, Vostok, Malden, and Starbuck).

The atoll is best known for being the first place on Earth to receive sunlight each day during much of the year, and for its role in the <a href="millennium%20celebrations">millennium celebrations</a>. A 1995 realignment of the <a href="International%20Date%20Line">International Date Line</a> made Caroline Island one of the first points of land on Earth to reach January 1, 2000 on the calendar.

Caroline Atoll lies near the southeastern end of the <a href="Line%20Islands">Line Islands</a>, a string of atolls extending across the equator some south of the <a href="Hawaiian%20Islands">Hawaiian Islands</a> in the central <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific</a>. The slightly crescent-shaped atoll (3.76 km or 1.45 mi in land area) consists of 39 separate islets surrounding a narrow <a href="lagoon">lagoon</a>, 8.7 by 1.2 km in size, or with an area of 6.3 km. The total atoll area, including dry land, lagoon and reef flat, measures 13 by 2.5 km, or 24 km. The islets rise to a height of only above sea level. The islets, like those of all atolls, share a common geologic origin and consist of sand deposits and <a href="limestone">limestone</a> rock set atop a <a href="coral%20reef">coral reef</a>. According to the path of the International Date Line, Caroline Island is the easternmost point of land on Earth.

Three large islets make up the bulk of Caroline's land area: Nake Islet (1.04 km or 0.40 mi) at the north; Long Islet (0.76 km or 0.29 mi) at the northeast of the lagoon and South Islet (1.07 km or 0.41 mi).
The remaining assembly of small islets, most of which were named during the 1988 ecological survey, conducted by <a href="Angela%20Kepler">Angela and Cameron Kepler</a>, fall into four major groupings: the South Nake Islets, the Central Leeward Islets, the Southern Leeward Islets, and the Windward Islets (see ). Caroline's islets are particularly ephemeral— over the course of a century of observation, several of the smallest islets have been documented to appear or disappear entirely following major storms, while the shapes of larger ones have significantly changed.
The central lagoon, roughly , is shallow – at most in depth – and is crossed repeatedly by narrow coral heads and patch reefs. Reef flats generally extend about from shore— although some sources report them to extend more than a kilometer from land— and make boat landings perilous except at high tide. There are no natural landings, anchorages, or deep water openings into the central lagoon; water which spills into the lagoon over shallow channels at high tide is contained within the surrounding reef and remains stable despite ocean tides. Most landings are generally made at a small break in the reef at the northeast corner of the South Islet (visible on the satellite photo above).

Densities of giant clams reach up to four per square foot in parts of the lagoon. The most common species is the “small giant clam” "<a href="Tridacna%20maxima">Tridacna maxima</a>" and largest clam species, "<a href="Tridacna%20gigas">Tridacna gigas</a>" is also found in the lagoon.

The lagoon is a nursery habitat for many fish species including important and heavily exploited species such as the <a href="Blacktip%20reef%20shark">Blacktip reef shark</a> ("Carcharhinus melanopterus") and the endangered <a href="Humphead%20wrasse">Napoleon wrasse</a> ("Cheilinus undulatus").

There is no standing fresh water on Caroline Island, although the Nake and South Islets harbor underground <a href="aquifer">freshwater aquifers</a> (or <a href="Ghyben-Herzberg%20lens">Ghyben-Herzberg lens</a>es), and wells have been built to tap drinking water for temporary settlements. Soils on Caroline are similarly poor, dominated by coral gravel and sand, with significant organic content present only within stable, forested island centers. Guano deposits make island soil, where it does exist, <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>-rich; but even in the oldest and most vegetated regions of the atoll, soils are only a few centimeters (one or two inches) thick.
Like the rest of Kiribati, Caroline Island enjoys a tropical maritime climate which is consistently hot and humid. Meteorological records are sparse, but temperatures generally range between 28 and 32 degrees Celsius (82 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit) year round. Caroline lies within a region of highly variable precipitation, but is estimated to receive an average of of rain annually. <a href="Tide">Tide</a>s are on the order of and trade winds, generally from the northeast, mean that corner of the island experiences the roughest seas.
Caroline Island is among the most remote islands on earth– from the closest land at <a href="Flint%20Island">Flint Island</a>, from the nearest permanent settlement on <a href="Kiritimati">Kiritimati</a>, from the Kiribati capital of <a href="Tarawa">Tarawa</a>, and from the nearest continental land in North America.

Despite more than three centuries of occasional human impact on Caroline, it is considered to be one of very few remaining near-pristine tropical islands, and has been rated as one of the most unspoiled Pacific atolls. Its relatively undisturbed state has led to Caroline being considered for designation as a <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> and as a <a href="Biosphere%20Reserve">Biosphere Reserve</a>. Ecological surveys documenting the island's flora and fauna have been made intermittently through the later 20th century: Caroline was visited in 1965 by the Pacific Ocean Biological Survey Program, in 1974 by the Line Island Expedition, and in 1988 and 1991 by the <a href="United%20Nations%20Environment%20Programme">United Nations Environment Programme</a> Wildlife Conservation Unit.
Caroline Island is heavily vegetated, and most islets possess three ringed zones of vegetation: an outermost herb mat, typically composed mainly of "<a href="Heliotropium%20anomalum">Heliotropium anomalum</a>"; an inward zone of shrub, primarily "<a href="Heliotropium%20foertherianum">Heliotropium foertherianum</a>"; and a central forested region, typically dominated by groves of "<a href="Pisonia%20grandis">Pisonia grandis</a>" trees. <a href="Coconut%20palm">Coconut palm</a>s have also been introduced and exist in substantial quantities on the larger islets. This pattern of vegetation is consistent across the larger islets, with smaller islets lacking the central forest and the smallest vegetated solely by low herbs. Other common plants include "<a href="Suriana">Suriana maritima</a>" and "<a href="Noni">Morinda citrifolia</a>".
Caroline Island is an important breeding site for a number of species of <a href="seabird">seabird</a>s, most notably the <a href="sooty%20tern">sooty tern</a> ("Onychoprion fuscata"), numbering around 500,000 – a colony of sooty terns dominates the eastern islets – and the <a href="great%20frigatebird">great frigatebird</a> ("Fregata minor"), numbering over 10,000. Caroline Island and its neighbor, <a href="Flint%20Island">Flint Island</a>, also host some of the world's largest populations of the <a href="coconut%20crab">coconut crab</a>. ("Birgus latro"). Other native animals include the "<a href="Tridacna">Tridacna</a>" clam, which is abundant in the central lagoon, <a href="hermit%20crab">hermit crab</a>s, and multiple species of lizards.
The <a href="endangered%20species">endangered</a> <a href="green%20turtle">green turtle</a> ("Chelonia mydas") nests on the beaches of Caroline Island, but there have been reports of poaching by recent homesteaders. The <a href="bristle-thighed%20curlew">bristle-thighed curlew</a> ("Numenius tahitiensis"), a migrant visitor from <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, is also classified as <a href="Conservation%20status%20%28TNC%29">vulnerable</a>.
Around twenty non-native species of flora have been <a href="Introduced%20species">introduced</a> to Caroline Island via human contact. Among these are the vine "<a href="Ipomoea%20violacea">Ipomoea violacea</a>", which has begun to proliferate. Domestic <a href="cat">cat</a>s and <a href="dog">dog</a>s introduced alongside a small homestead have driven the seabird population away from the islet of Monu Ata-Ata.

Caroline Island is believed to have originated from a <a href="hotspot%20%28geology%29">volcanic hotspot</a> which eroded and then became home to a coral reef which grew above the ocean surface. Although these geological processes are poorly understood, the orientation of the Line Islands (roughly north-south) suggests that they were formed more than 40 million years ago, before the <a href="Pacific%20Plate">Pacific Plate</a> changed its direction of travel. The same hotspot more recently gave rise to the <a href="Tuamotu%20Archipelago">Tuamotu Archipelago</a>.
There is evidence of settlement by <a href="Polynesian%20culture">Polynesian</a> peoples on the largest islets from before European contact. Graves and template platforms were uncovered by early expeditions to the island, and a large <a href="marae">marae</a> exists on the west side of Nake Islet. To date, these artifacts have not been surveyed by archaeologists.

Ferdinand Magellan may have sighted Caroline Island on February 4, 1521.

The next recorded sighting of Caroline Island by Europeans was on February 21, 1606, by <a href="Pedro%20Fern%C3%A1ndez%20de%20Quir%C3%B3s">Pedro Fernández de Quirós</a>, a <a href="Portugal">Portuguese</a> explorer sailing on behalf of <a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spain</a>; his account names the island "San Bernardo." The atoll was "rediscovered" on December 16, 1795 by Captain <a href="William%20Robert%20Broughton">William Robert Broughton</a> of , who gave the atoll the name Carolina (which later became Caroline) "in compliment to the daughter of <a href="Sir%20Philip%20Stephens%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir P. Stephens</a> of the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a>." Caroline was again sighted in 1821 by the English <a href="whaling">whaling</a> ship "Supply" and was then named "Thornton Island" for the ship's captain. Other early names for the atoll include Hirst Island, Clark Island, and Independence Island. Among other early visits which left behind accounts of the island are that of the <a href="USS%20Dolphin%20%281821%29">USS "Dolphin"</a> in 1825 (recorded by Lieutenant <a href="Hiram%20Paulding">Hiram Paulding</a>), and of a whaling ship in 1835 (recorded by Frederick Debell Bennett in his "Narrative of a Whaling Voyage Round the Globe From the Year 1833–1836").
In 1846, the Tahitian firm of Collie and Lucett attempted to establish a small stock-raising and <a href="copra">copra</a> (coconut meat) community on the island, an operation which met with limited financial success. In 1868, Caroline was claimed by the British vessel <a href="HMS%20Reindeer%20%281866%29">HMS "Reindeer"</a>, which noted 27 residents in a settlement on South Islet. In 1872, the island was leased by the British government to Houlder Brothers and Co., with <a href="John%20T.%20Arundel">John T. Arundel</a> as the manager (for whom one of the islets is named) John T. Arundel and Co. took over the lease in 1881. In 1885 Arundel established a coconut plantation, however the coconut palms suffered from disease and the plantation failed. The settlement on the island lasted until 1904, when the six remaining Polynesians were relocated to <a href="Niue">Niue</a>.
Houlder Brothers and Co., under the management of Arundel, also conducted minimal <a href="guano">guano</a> mining on the island from 1874. In 1881, Arundel also took over the <a href="guano">guano</a> mining, which supplied a total of about 10,000 tons of <a href="phosphate">phosphate</a> until supplies were exhausted around 1895.
In 1883, an expedition of American astronomers traveled from <a href="Peru">Peru</a> to Caroline Island aboard the to observe a total <a href="solar%20eclipse">solar eclipse</a> on May 6. A French expedition also observed the eclipse from Caroline, and the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> mapped the atoll. <a href="Johann%20Palisa">Johann Palisa</a>, a member of the expedition, discovered an asteroid later that year which he named <a href="235%20Carolina">Carolina</a> "in remembrance of his visit to [the] island."

Leased to S.R. Maxwell and Company, a new settlement was established in 1916, this time built entirely upon <a href="copra">copra</a> export. Much of the South islet was deforested to make way for coconut palms, a non-indigenous plant. The business venture, however, went into debt, and the island's settlement slowly decreased in population. By 1926, it was down to only ten residents and by 1936, the settlement consisted of only two <a href="Tahiti">Tahiti</a>an families before abandonment sometime in the late 1930s.
Caroline Island remained uninhabited and undisturbed through <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and afterwards. It remained under British jurisdiction, repossessed by the British Western Pacific High Commission in 1943 and governed as part of the <a href="Central%20and%20Southern%20Line%20Islands">Central and Southern Line Islands</a>. In January 1972, the Central and Southern Line Islands, including Caroline, were joined with the British colony of the <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Ellice%20Islands">Gilbert and Ellice Islands</a>, which had become autonomous in 1971 as part of British <a href="decolonization">decolonization</a> efforts.
In 1979, the Gilbert Islands became the independent nation of Kiribati; Caroline Island is Kiribati's easternmost point. The entire island is owned by the government of the Republic of Kiribati, overseen by the Ministry of Line and <a href="Phoenix%20Islands">Phoenix</a> Groups, which is headquartered on <a href="Kiritimati">Kiritimati</a>. Competing claims to sovereignty over the island by the United States (under the <a href="Guano%20Islands%20Act">Guano Islands Act</a>) were relinquished in the 1979 "<a href="Treaty%20of%20Tarawa">Treaty of Tarawa</a>", ratified by the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a> in 1983.
The island was briefly inhabited again from 1987 to 1991 by Ron Falconer, his wife Anne, and their two children, who developed a largely self-sufficient settlement on the atoll. Following a transfer of ownership, Falconer was evicted from the island by the Kiribati government. A book, "Together Alone" (), written by Falconer, documents the story of their residence on Caroline Island.
In the 1990s, the island was leased to Urima Felix, a <a href="French%20Polynesia">French Polynesia</a>n entrepreneur; he established a small homestead on one of the islets and reportedly had plans for development of the atoll. The island is also occasionally visited by Polynesian <a href="copra">copra</a> gatherers under agreements with the Kiribati government in <a href="Tarawa%20Atoll">Tarawa</a>.

On December 23, 1994, the Republic of Kiribati announced a change of <a href="time%20zone">time zone</a> for the Line Islands, to take effect December 31, 1994. This adjustment effectively moved the International Date Line over to the east within Kiribati, placing all of Kiribati on the Asian or western side of the date line, despite the fact that Caroline's longitude of 150 degrees west corresponds to <a href="UTC-10">UTC−10</a> rather than its official time zone of <a href="UTC%2B14">UTC+14</a>. Caroline Island now is at the same time as the Hawaiian Islands (<a href="Hawaii-Aleutian%20Standard%20Time%20Zone">Hawaii-Aleutian Standard Time Zone</a>), but one day ahead. This move made Caroline Island both the easternmost land in the earliest time zone (by some definitions, the <a href="Extreme%20points%20of%20Earth">easternmost point on Earth</a>), and one of the first points of land which would see sunrise on January 1, 2000 — at 5:43 a.m., as measured by local time.
The stated reason for the move was a campaign promise of Kiribati President <a href="Teburoro%20Tito">Teburoro Tito</a> to eliminate the confusion of Kiribati straddling the Date Line and therefore being constantly in two different days. However, Kiribati officials were not reluctant to attempt to capitalize on the nation's new status as owners of the first land to see sunrise in 2000. Other Pacific nations, including <a href="Tonga">Tonga</a> and New Zealand's <a href="Chatham%20Islands">Chatham Islands</a>, protested the move, objecting that it infringed on their claims to be the first land to see dawn in the year 2000.
In 1999, in order to further capitalize upon the massive public interest in celebrations marking <a href="Millennium%20celebrations">the arrival of the year 2000</a>, Caroline Island was officially renamed Millennium Island. Although uninhabited, the island hosted a special celebration featuring performances by Kiribati native entertainers and attended by Kiribati president Tito. Over 70 Kiribati singers and dancers traveled to Caroline from the capital <a href="South%20Tarawa">Tarawa</a>, accompanied by approximately 25 journalists. The celebration, broadcast by satellite worldwide, had an estimated audience of up to one billion viewers.
Despite many media and government claims to the contrary, Caroline Island was not the first point of land to see sunrise on January 1, 2000 (local time); that distinction belongs to a point of land between Dibble Glacier and Victor Bay on the coast of <a href="East%20Antarctica">East Antarctica</a>, at , where the sun rose 35 minutes earlier. As this point is close to the <a href="Antarctic%20Circle">Antarctic Circle</a>, and the area beyond the Antarctic Circle is affected by the <a href="Midnight%20sun">continuous sunlight</a> in December, the definition of the exact point becomes a question of distinguishing between a sunset and an immediate sunrise in view of <a href="atmospheric%20refraction">atmospheric refraction</a> effects.

As Caroline Island only extends six meters above sea level, it would be in danger if <a href="sea%20level%20rise">sea levels rise</a>. The Kiribati government estimates that the island may be reclaimed by the sea as soon as 2025, and the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> has rated Caroline Island as among those most in danger from sea level rise.
