Consultation (Texas)

The Consultation served as the provisional government of <a href="Mexican%20Texas">Mexican Texas</a> from October 1835 to March 1836 during the <a href="Texas%20Revolution">Texas Revolution</a>. Tensions rose in Texas during early 1835 as throughout Mexico <a href="federalism">federalists</a> began to oppose the increasingly <a href="centralized%20government">centralist</a> policies of the government. In the summer, <a href="Texians">Texians</a> elected delegates to a political convention to be held in <a href="Gonzales%2C%20Texas">Gonzales</a> in mid-October. Weeks before the convention and war began, settlers took up arms against Mexican soldiers at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gonzales">Battle of Gonzales</a>. The convention was postponed until November 1 after many of the delegates joined the newly organized volunteer <a href="Texan%20Army">Texian Army</a> to initiate a <a href="siege%20of%20Bexar">siege of the Mexican garrison at San Antonio de Bexar</a>. On November 3, a quorum was reached in San Antonio. 
Within days, the delegates passed a resolution to define why Texians were fighting. They expressed allegiance to the deposed <a href="Constitution%20of%201824">Constitution of 1824</a> and maintained their right to form an independent government while this document was not in effect. <a href="Henry%20Smith%20%28Texas%20Governor%29">Henry Smith</a> was elected governor of the new provisional government and the remaining delegates formed a General Council. In the next weeks, the council authorized the creation of a new <a href="regular%20army">regular army</a> to be commanded by <a href="Sam%20Houston">Sam Houston</a>. As Houston worked to establish an army independent from the existing volunteer army, the council repeatedly interfered in military matters.

After authorizing <a href="Matamoros%20Expedition">an expedition</a> to take <a href="Matamoros%2C%20Tamaulipas">Matamoros, Mexico</a>, the council named several men, simultaneously, to organize and lead the assault, angry at the effect the expedition was having on existing Texian garrisons, Smith dissolved the council. Alleging that Smith did not have the authority to disband them, council members impeached him and lieutenant governor <a href="James%20W.%20Robinson%20%28Texas%20and%20California%29">James W. Robinson</a> was named acting governor.

The <a href="Mexican%20War%20of%20Independence">Mexican War of Independence</a> (1810-1821) severed Spain's control over much of <a href="New%20Spain">its North American territories</a>, including <a href="Spanish%20Texas">Texas</a>. The <a href="1824%20Constitution%20of%20Mexico">1824 Constitution of Mexico</a> defined the new country as a <a href="federal%20republic">federal republic</a> with nineteen states and four territories. Due to limited population and extremely poor economies, the provinces of Texas and Coahuila were combined to become the state <a href="Coahuila%20y%20Tejas">Coahuila y Tejas</a>. In the hopes that an influx of settlers could control the Indian raids, the new government liberalized immigration policies for the region. Under the <a href="General%20Colonization%20Law">General Colonization Law</a> people from the United States could, for the first time, legally settle in Texas. Large tracts of land were granted to "<a href="empresario">empresario</a>s", who were responsible for recruiting settlers and establishing communities in Texas. With one exception, the new colonies were settled by foreigners. "<a href="Tejano">Tejano</a>s", Texas residents of Mexican descent, were soon vastly outnumbered by <a href="Anglo%23United%20States">Anglo</a>s. By 1834, an estimated 30,000 Anglos lived in Coahuila y Tejas, compared to only 7,800 Tejanos. By 1833, Texas was divided into three political divisions: the Department of Béxar, the Department of <a href="Nacogdoches%2C%20Texas">Nacogdoches</a>, and the Department of the Brazos.

By late 1834, the Mexican government began transitioning from a <a href="federalism">federalist</a> model to <a href="centralized%20government">centralism</a>. Santa Anna overturned the 1824 Constitution, dismissed the state legislatures, and ordered all militias disbanded. Federalists throughout Mexico were appalled. The governor of Coahuila y Tejas, <a href="Agust%C3%ADn%20Viesca">Agustín Viesca</a>, refused to dissolve the legislature, instead ordering that the session reconvene in Béxar, further from the influence of the Mexican army. Viesca was arrested before he reached Texas. Citizens in the states of <a href="Oaxaca">Oaxaca</a> and <a href="Zacatecas">Zacatecas</a> took up arms.

Public opinion in Texas was divided. In June 1835, one group staged a minor revolt against customs duties in <a href="Anahuac%2C%20Texas">Anahuac</a>. Resolutions by the city councils in <a href="Bastrop%2C%20Texas">Mina</a>, Gonzales, Goliad, and <a href="West%20Columbia%2C%20Texas">Columbia</a> denounced their actions. Civic leaders in Mina were so disgusted they called for public meetings to determine whether settlers supported independence, a return to federalism, or the status quo. Although some leaders worried that Mexican officials would see this type of gathering as a step toward revolution, the "<a href="ayuntamiento">ayuntamiento</a>s" of both Columbia and <a href="San%20Felipe%2C%20Texas">San Felipe</a> quickly endorsed the suggestion. They hoped that a political convention would make it quite clear that the majority of <a href="Texian">Texian</a>s did not support the radicals. After the leaders of Columbia argued forcefully for the convention, the political chief of the <a href="Department%20%28country%20subdivision%29">department</a> of the Brazos called for a meeting of representatives of municipalities in that department on August 1. Only four of the seven appointed delegates appeared. Discovering there was no official agenda, the four men returned home without actually doing anything.

As a response to the <a href="Anahuac%20disturbances">Anahuac disturbances</a>, the commander of the Mexican army in Texas, <a href="Domingo%20de%20Ugartechea">Domingo de Ugartechea</a>, requested reinforcements to help capture the dissidents. Small groups of soldiers began arriving in early August; in response, local municipalities formed Committees of Correspondence and Safety and unofficial militias. On August 9, citizens at a public meeting in <a href="Brazoria%2C%20Texas">Brazoria</a> again broached the idea of a larger political convention. Other communities debated whether to participate in such a convention, and whether its goals should be simply an exchange of opinions or to create an interim government. The proposed political gathering, which became known as the Consultation, was endorsed by <a href="Stephen%20F.%20Austin">Stephen F. Austin</a>, the first "empresario" in Texas, on September 8, which solidified support throughout the Anglo colonies. Austin became the "de facto" leader of the Consultation, making plans for the gathering, which would convene on October 15. He requested that each community send one delegate early, to form a Permanent Council to start gathering opinions.

In the interim, hostilities between Mexican soldiers and Texas colonists increased, and in early October a group of <a href="Texian">Texian</a>s attacked a Mexican army contingent which had been sent to retrieve a cannon that had previously been loaned to Gonzales. This small skirmish marked the official start of the <a href="Texas%20Revolution">Texas Revolution</a>. Gonzales became a rallying point for Texas settlers who opposed the centralist policies, and men flocked to the town. On October 11, the men formed themselves into a volunteer <a href="Texian%20Army">Texian Army</a> and elected Austin as their commander. Many of the Consultation delegates had also gathered in Gonzales, and rather than wait for the session to begin, they joined the army on a march against the Mexican garrison at Béxar.

By October 16, only 31 delegates had arrived in San Felipe, short of a quorum. Most expected the <a href="siege%20of%20B%C3%A9xar">siege of Béxar</a> to be over very quickly, so the Consultation was postponed until November 1. In the interim, this group of delegates granted power to the Permanent Council, which in practice included representation from only seven districts. The Permanent Council made weak attempts to govern the area, but primarily carried out Austin's orders. In its most controversial move, the council closed all land offices in the region on October 27, to prevent speculators from seizing land during the unrest.

The <a href="siege%20of%20B%C3%A9xar">siege of Béxar</a> began in late October. Newly arrived immigrant <a href="Sam%20Houston">Sam Houston</a> traveled to Béxar to exhort the delegates to leave the siege and come to the Consultation. In a compromise, the officers voted to allow delegates who were members of the rank-and-file or were line officers to leave the siege, while those who were staff officers would remain to oversee military operations. <a href="William%20B.%20Travis">William B. Travis</a>, <a href="William%20H.%20Wharton">William Wharton</a>, and <a href="Stephen%20F.%20Austin">Stephen F. Austin</a> remained behind, while twenty delegates, including <a href="James%20Bowie">James Bowie</a>, accompanied Houston to San Felipe.

Each municipality in Texas was encouraged to send five delegates to the convention. Some municipalities, including Nacogdoches, elected seven. A total of 98 delegates were elected. These men were established citizens, with an average length of residence of seven years, with an average age of 38. Approximately one-third of the delegates were staunch supporters of the Constitution of 1824, another third strongly advocated independence, and the remainder were unaligned.

Only 58 of these men attended. None of the delegates from the war areas - Béxar, Goliad, <a href="Refugio%2C%20Texas">Refugio</a>, <a href="Victoria%2C%20Texas">Victoria</a>, and <a href="San%20Patricio%2C%20Texas">San Patricio</a> - appeared. This effectively ensured that there were no "Tejano" delegates that the Consultation. Many delegates from the other regions of Texas remained in the army or stayed home to defend their families. Because Austin and many of his Peace Party supporters were still with the army at Bexar, they were unable to provide as much influence to the gathering as expected.

An overwhelming percentage of the delegates who attended were men who had previous political experience. Twenty of them had been active in the Communities of Correspondence and Public Safety in their respective towns.

A quorum finally formed on November 3, and delegates continued to arrive over the next few days. Although Austin had endorsed <a href="Lorenzo%20de%20Zavala">Lorenzo de Zavala</a> to preside over the gathering, delegates elected <a href="Branch%20Tanner%20Archer">Branch Tanner Archer</a> of <a href="Brazoria%20County%2C%20Texas">Brazoria</a>. In a speech after his appointment, Archer urged his comrades "to divest yourselves of all party feelings, to discard every selfish motive, and look alone to the true interest of your country." Before the group could move towards official business, Houston rose to a make speech. He gave thanks to many for actions taken over the recent months. His eloquence was unimportant and unnecessary, except as a means for him to become better known to the other delegates. For the remainder of the day, the delegates drafted rules of order. Similar to those used in the legislative bodies of the United States and Europe, the rules emphasized courtesy. In an unusual move, the rules prohibited delegates from abstaining from voting. As president, Archer was forbidden from voting except to break a tie.

The Consultation's main purpose was to decide the overall goals of the revolution. Members of the War Party advocated for complete independence from Mexico, while Peace Party representatives wished for Texas to remain part of Mexico, but only under the 1824 Constitution of Mexico. Although Austin was unable to attend, he did send a letter to the consultation, asking them to follow the Constitution of 1824 and to make it clear to Mexico that the hostilities were not an attempt for independence but instead a determination to fight for their rights as Mexican citizens.

On November 4, <a href="John%20Austin%20Wharton%20%281806%E2%80%9338%29">John Wharton</a> was named chair of a committee to determine the purpose of the war. After three full days of deliberation failed to produce a resolution, delegates began a full debate on the floor. The turning point of the discussion came when Houston, who many believed to be a staunch member of the War Party, asked the fellow delegates to refrain from declaring independence. Such a declaration would likely cause many of the people who supported the Constitution of 1824 in other parts of Mexico to refrain from supporting the Texians. The Consultation compromised. On November 7, they released a resolution declaring that "The people of Texas, availing themselves of their natural rights, solemnly declare that they have taken up arms in defense of their rights and liberties which were threatened by the encroachments of military despots and in defense of the Republican principles of the federal constitution of Mexico of 1824." The resolution further specified that Texas reserved the right to create an independent government as long as Mexico was not governed by that <a href="1824%20Constitution%20of%20Mexico">document</a>. The members hoped that this wording would allow them to gain support from both federalists within Mexico and from the United States. The resolution passed 33–14.

In what historian <a href="William%20C.%20Davis%20%28historian%29">William C. Davis</a> dubbed "the three shortest yet perhaps most significant resolutions in the document," the delegates agreed that Texas would pay for the army, would repay any goods purchased by its agents, and would give volunteers public lands. These were powers reserved for states, and under the Constitution of 1824 Texas was not a stand-alone state. With these words, delegates violated the very constitution they had sworn to uphold. Davis asserts that this provision signified that the delegates fully intended for Texas to become an independent nation, eventually.

Fifty-seven delegates signed the resolution. de Zavala translated it into Spanish, and copies in both languages were ordered to be printed and distributed to residents.
A committee was immediately established to design a provisional government, with <a href="Henry%20Smith%20%28Texas%20Governor%29">Henry Smith</a> as chair. The committee's first proposal was a near-verbatim copy of the <a href="preamble%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">preamble to the United States Constitution</a> and included a statement that Texas was now a "sovereign state". Delegates voted against this draft and insisted that the committee membership be changed. All committee members who supported independence were removed from their positions, and the new committee began deliberations anew. On November 13, this group produced a document that won approval.

The new government would consist of a chief executive and a General Council who would share powers. Under the assumption that these two branches would have full cooperation, there was no system of checks and balances. Believing there was no time to wait for general elections, the Consultation determined that the governor and lieutenant governor would be chosen by the delegates themselves, a practice somewhat common among states in the United States. Although Austin was nominated, he lost to Smith 31–22. <a href="James%20W.%20Robinson%20%28Texas%20and%20California%29">James Robinson</a> was elected lieutenant governor. As lieutenant governor, Robinson would preside over the General Council, which would consist of one representative from each municipality.

Three delegates-Austin, Archer, and Wharton-were appointed as agents to the United States to try to raise money and volunteers. Austin immediately resigned his post as commander of the volunteers; the troops elected <a href="Edward%20Burleson">Edward Burleson</a> as their new leader. Houston was appointed to the Select Committee on Indian Affairs, as he had spent much of his career dealing with Indian nations. The Texians needed the support of the Indians (or at least their neutrality) to win their fight against Mexico.

The Consultation officially adjourned on November 15, leaving the new provisional government in charge.

The soldiers currently fighting near Béxar were volunteers, who joined the army to accomplish a specific task and staunchly maintained their right to elect their own leaders. On November 13, the council officially established a <a href="regular%20army">regular army</a>. Houston was appointed to command this new Provisional Army of Texas, subject to the orders of the governor. Houston was instructed to raise an army from scratch; because the volunteers had organized before the Consultation convened, they could not be forced to accept Houston as their commander. The new army should consist of 2,500 men, who would enlist for 2-year terms in exchange for land grants.

After consulting with some of the officers currently at the siege of Béxar, notably Travis and <a href="James%20W.%20Fannin">James W. Fannin</a>, the council chose to expand the army. On December 5 they created a Corps of Permanent Volunteers, which would have a shorter enlistment period and more autonomy. This move hindered Houston's efforts to fill his regular army; most citizens preferred to join the Permanent Volunteers.

On December 11, the Mexican troops in Béxar surrendered and agreed to march south of the <a href="Rio%20Grande">Rio Grande</a>. With their departure, there was no longer an organized garrison of Mexican troops in Texas, and many of the Texians believed that the war was over. Burleson resigned his leadership of the army on December 15 and returned to his home. Many of the men did likewise, and <a href="Frank%20W.%20Johnson">Frank W. Johnson</a> assumed command of the 400 soldiers who remained.

The Mexican retreat gave the Council the time to formalize the government and begin planning for the future, without the threat of attack. Little was accomplished. The new Texas government had no funds, so the military was granted the authority to impress any supplies that would be useful. This policy soon resulted in an almost universal hatred of the Council, as food and supplies became scarce, especially in the areas around Goliad and Béxar, where Texian troops were stationed. The "<a href="Telegraph%20and%20Texas%20Register">Telegraph and Texas Register</a>" noted that "some are not willing, under the present government, to do any duty...That our government is bad, all acknowledge, and no one will deny."

Citing an aborted coup attempt on November 25, Smith proposed a bill making it treasonous to make threats against the provisional government. The Council, by now used to "the governor's addiction to exaggerated and inflammatory rhetoric", ignored him. On December 19, a group of prominent citizens, led by <a href="Moseley%20Baker">Moseley Baker</a>, <a href="Wylie%20Martin">Wylie Martin</a>, and William Pettus, held a meeting in San Felipe to build support for dismantling the provisional government. They were concerned that the Council was moving too seriously towards independence instead of an adherence to the Constitution of 1824. Yet the Council had not gone far enough for some. Disillusionment with the interim government and an increased militancy among troops, whose ranks were now primarily composed of newly arrived volunteers from the United States, led to calls for a new convention. Brazoria passed a resolution asking for a convention to meet in March 1836 to declare independence. Soldiers in Goliad went a step further and drafted <a href="Goliad%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">a declaration of independence</a> on December 22. The Council passed a resolution to call the <a href="Convention%20of%201836">Convention of 1836</a>, to meet on March 1 in <a href="Washington-on-the-Brazos%2C%20Texas">Washington-on-the-Brazos</a>.

In mid-November Governor Viesca, who had been freed by sympathetic soldiers, reached <a href="Goliad%2C%20Texas">Goliad</a>. The commander at Goliad, <a href="Philip%20Dimmitt">Philip Dimmitt</a> welcomed Viesca but refused to recognize his authority as governor. This caused an uproar in the garrison; many supported the governor, while others believed that Texas should be an independent country and should therefore not recognize the Mexican governor. Viesca traveled to San Felipe to meet with the General Council, who also refused to recognize his authority as governor. Viesca joined several others in advocating a plan to attack centralist troops in <a href="Matamoros%2C%20Tamaulipas">Matamoros</a>. They hoped this <a href="Matamoros%20Expedition">Matamoros Expedition</a> would inspire other federalist states to revolt and keep the bored Texian troops from deserting the army. Most importantly, it would move the war zone outside of Texas. The governor initially supported the plan, and asked Houston to organize the expedition; Houston appointed <a href="James%20Bowie">James Bowie</a> to lead the expedition, but Bowie did not receive his orders for several weeks. The Council asked Burleson, the commander of the volunteers at Bexar, to lead the expedition. Burleson had already resigned, and his elected replacement, Johnson, instead received the message. While Johnson journeyed to San Felipe to meet with the Council, on December 30, Johnson's aide-de-camp, <a href="James%20Grant%20%28Texas%29">James Grant</a> led 200 men from Béxar to travel to Goliad to prepare for the expedition. Only 100 Texians remained at the <a href="Alamo%20Mission">Alamo Mission</a> in Bexar, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel <a href="James%20C.%20Neill">James C. Neill</a>. Neill was disgusted that Johnson had stripped the Alamo of almost all provisions and the majority of the men and sent a strong message to Houston asking for reinforcements and more supplies.36 people attend the consultation

Although Bowie also appeared before the Council with his written orders from Houston to lead the Matamoros Expedition, on January 6 the Council authorized Johnson to lead the expedition. Johnson initially declined the commission, but changed his mind the following day. Without revoking Johnson's commission, the Council elected Fannin to lead the mission instead. Smith was incensed when he learned the Council had appointed their own commander for the expedition, and he became even more angry when Houston forwarded the letter from Neill, with an added note that he believed the Johnson mission was illegal, as the council had not had a quorum when it was authorized. By now, both Smith and Houston had decided that the expedition had little chance of success.

Smith denounced the expedition as idiocy and labelled its supporters either fools or traitors. He then disbanded the council until March 1 unless they agreed to renounce the Matamoros Expedition. The council determined that Smith had no authority to dismiss them. They soon impeached Smith and named the lieutenant governor, Robinson, Acting Governor. The documents forming the provisional government, however, did not grant the council the authority to impeach the governor.

On January 12, Smith wrote a conciliatory letter to the council: "I admit that I [used] language beyond the rules of decorum", and declared that if the council would admit that their actions regarding the Matamoros Expedition were wrong he would reinstate them so that "the two branches [would] again harmonize to the promotion of the true interests of the country". Weary of the infighting and unsure who was actually in charge, Council members slowly stopped appearing. In the hopes of salvaging a government, Robinson appointed four members to an Advisory Committee. Soon, this dwindled to only two members. The interim government was essentially over by the end of January.

Nicholas Caradoc Hoult was born in <a href="Wokingham">Wokingham</a>, <a href="Berkshire">Berkshire</a> to piano teacher Glenis ("née" Brown) and pilot Roger Hoult; his middle name Caradoc (pronounced /ka.rɑː'dɔk/), is <a href="Welsh%20language">Welsh</a> and translates to "The Beloved One". His paternal great-aunt was <a href="Dame">Dame</a> <a href="Anna%20Neagle">Anna Neagle</a>, a stage and film actor active in the 1930s and 1940s. He has three siblings: an elder brother James, who is a United States-based biology student; and two sisters, Rosanna and Clarista, both of whom are television actors. Hoult spent most of his childhood at his family's residence in <a href="Sindlesham">Sindlesham</a>, an <a href="estate%20village">estate village</a> in the <a href="Ancient%20borough">borough</a> of Wokingham. His older siblings were interested in acting and dancing from an early age, taking classes and attending auditions. As a child, he began accompanying them and developed his own interest in acting. He discussed his childhood and his relationship with his siblings in a 2011 interview with "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" saying, "[we were] pretty outdoorsy normal kids running around in the garden and making tree houses ... it was very normal".

During Hoult's childhood, his father was regularly working away from home and his brother was away attending school. As a result, he spent most of his time with his mother and sisters; he said being raised by women might have helped him "steer clear of some pitfalls that guys who didn't grow up with women would fall into". Hoult was educated at The Coombes Nursery in <a href="Arborfield">Arborfield</a> and Arborfield Church of England Junior School. He practised ballet with his sisters and took part in productions of "<a href="Swan%20Lake">Swan Lake</a>" and "<a href="The%20Nutcracker">The Nutcracker</a>" with the <a href="English%20National%20Ballet">English National Ballet</a>. Although he initially wanted to attain <a href="GCE%20Advanced%20Level">advanced level certificates</a> in English, Biology, and <a href="Psychology">Psychology</a>, in 2002, at the age of 12, he decided instead to attend acting school at Sylvia Young Theatre School. At the age of 14, he left to attend the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>'s secondary school <a href="Ranelagh%20School">Ranelagh School</a>. Hoult played trombone as a child and was a member of the local choir.

Nicholas' acting potential was discovered at the age of three by a theatre director during a performance of a play that starred the Nicholas' brother. The director was impressed Nicholas' ability to "concentrate well" and offered him a role in his next theatre production, "<a href="The%20Caucasian%20Chalk%20Circle">The Caucasian Chalk Circle</a>". Hoult began attending auditions and at the age of five was cast in the 1996 drama "<a href="Intimate%20Relations%20%281996%20film%29">Intimate Relations</a>", his first feature-film role. He later appeared in the television programmes "<a href="Casualty%20%28TV%20series%29">Casualty</a>", "<a href="Silent%20Witness">Silent Witness</a>", "<a href="The%20Bill">The Bill</a>", "<a href="Judge%20John%20Deed">Judge John Deed</a>", and "<a href="Doctors%20%282000%20TV%20series%29">Doctors</a>", among others. Hoult initially treated acting as a hobby rather than a potential career option; in a March 2009 interview with "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" he said he was not "in love with it ... I just enjoyed it. It was like playing for a football team. When you got a part it was great. And meeting new people. It was an exciting new world."

Hoult's next feature-film appearance came at the age of eleven alongside <a href="Hugh%20Grant">Hugh Grant</a> in <a href="chris%20Weitz">Chris</a> and <a href="Paul%20Weitz%20%28filmmaker%29">Paul Weitz</a>'s 2002 comedy-drama film "<a href="About%20a%20Boy%20%28film%29">About a Boy</a>". Hoult was initially reluctant to audition for the role as the casting process was a lengthy one and interfered with his schooling. He nonetheless decided to participate in the early rounds of auditions and was eventually cast in the role of Marcus, a "woolly-hatted, oddball son of a suicidal, hippy-ish single mother, [who] gets bullied horribly at school". "About a Boy" was a commercial success, grossing more than $130 million worldwide and receiving praise by film critics. Hoult's portrayal of a lonely schoolboy was well received; David Thomas, writing for "The Daily Telegraph", attributed the film's appeal and success to Hoult's performance. By the time the film was released, Hoult had left his junior school in Arborfield and began attending Sylvia Young Theatre School in London. He said the change was difficult; his time there was short and he preferred attending a regular school. He still did not want to pursue acting as a profession and at 14 he left Sylvia Young Theatre School in favour of Ranelagh School, a Berkshire-based Church of England day school.

Hoult starred in <a href="Richard%20E.%20Grant">Richard E. Grant</a>'s semi-autobiographical film "<a href="Wah-Wah%20%28film%29">Wah-Wah</a>" (2005) as Ralph Compton, a boy who is forced to deal with the disintegration of his family. The film, set in <a href="Swaziland">Swaziland</a> during the 1960s, chronicles the decline of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> in Africa. Hoult made his debut in <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> with <a href="Gore%20Verbinski">Gore Verbinski</a>'s film "<a href="The%20Weather%20Man">The Weather Man</a>" (2005) as the son of a television weather presenter (<a href="Nicolas%20Cage">Nicolas Cage</a>) undergoing a <a href="mid-life%20crisis">mid-life crisis</a>. The film and Hoult's performance went unnoticed. Both "Wah-Wah" and "The Weather Man" performed poorly at the box office.

Hoult was a student at <a href="Sixth%20Form%20College%20Farnborough">Sixth Form College Farnborough</a> in 2006 when he was cast in the lead role of the television teenage-drama <a href="Skins%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">"Skins"</a>. He was initially sceptical of his ability to play <a href="Tony%20Stonem">Tony Stonem</a>, a manipulative, egocentric anti-hero, and identified more closely with the supporting character Sid. The programme was a success and ran for seven series, only two of which Hoult appeared in. His performance was well received; the character was popular, and Hoult garnered widespread attention. "Skins" won the <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts">British Academy of Film and Television Arts</a> (BAFTA) Philip Audience Award, and Hoult was nominated for the <a href="Golden%20Nymph%20Award">Golden Nymph Award</a> for Best Actor in a Drama Series. Critic Elliott David lauded Hoult for his performance in a 2016 retrospective review, and wrote that he "maintain[ed] the inexplicable core of his character throughout". During his time on "Skins", Hoult felt overwhelmed by the attention he received and considered discontinuing acting at one point. Instead, he left school at the end of "Skins" first season and chose to focus solely on acting.

Hoult briefly appeared as Stefan Fredman in the pilot episode of the British television series <a href="Wallander%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">"Wallander"</a>. He later made his <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End theatre</a> debut as Mark, the protagonist in <a href="William%20Sutcliffe">William Sutcliffe</a>'s coming-of-age play "New Boy"; the production premiered at <a href="Trafalgar%20Studios">Trafalgar Studios</a> and had record-breaking ticket sales, which was mostly attributed to Hoult's popularity among viewers of "Skins". The play was staged for a week in March 2009 because Hoult had committed to a part in the fantasy-adventure film "<a href="Clash%20of%20the%20Titans%20%282010%20film%29">Clash of the Titans</a>" (2010), filming for which was scheduled for mid-2010. Hoult's performance as Mark, a "ferociously bright and articulate but sexually confused sixth-former" received mixed responses from critics. Dominic Cavendish of "The Daily Telegraph" wrote that his performance was persuasive, but Lyn Gardner of "The Guardian" found him average and highlighted his inability to bring out the "unresolved sexual tension beneath [the] banter". "Clash of the Titans" was panned by critics but was a success at the box office, grossing nearly $500,000,000 worldwide.

Hoult next appeared in <a href="Tom%20Ford">Tom Ford</a>'s "<a href="A%20Single%20Man">A Single Man</a>" (2009), after the actor originally cast in the role of Kenny Potter left the film a few days before filming commenced. Hoult had previously shown interest in the project and had sent a recorded audition tape; he was eventually chosen for the role of Kenny, a homosexual college student who helps a college professor, played by <a href="Colin%20Firth">Colin Firth</a>, deal with his grief. "A Single Man" was variously described by media outlets as the first adult role for Hoult, who described Kenny as a "spontaneous" character not simply defined by his sexuality. Because the role was his first as an American character, Hoult worked on his <a href="American%20accent">accent</a>; Sukhdev Sandhu of "The Daily Telegraph" noted Ford's choice of casting British actors as Americans (Hoult and <a href="Matthew%20Goode">Matthew Goode</a>) and vice versa (<a href="Julianne%20Moore">Julianne Moore</a>). "A Single Man" opened to widespread acclaim despite reservations from critics about Ford's directorial abilities; it was a box-office success. The film earned Hoult a nomination for the <a href="BAFTA%20Rising%20Star%20Award">BAFTA Rising Star Award</a> at the 2010 ceremony; <a href="Kristen%20Stewart">Kristen Stewart</a> won the award. In 2010, Hoult voiced the character of Elliot in <a href="Lionhead%20Studios">Lionhead Studios</a>' <a href="action%20role-playing%20game">action role-playing game</a> "<a href="Fable%20III">Fable III</a>" (2010).

Hoult was cast as <a href="Nux%20%28Mad%20Max%20character%29">Nux</a> in <a href="George%20Miller%20%28director%29">George Miller</a>'s action film ""; the project spent several years in <a href="development%20hell">development hell</a> because plans for a fourth film in the <a href="Mad%20Max%20%28franchise%29">"Mad Max" franchise</a> encountered financial difficulties. Filming was planned for mid-2010, but heavy rain caused severe delays during pre-production in Australia. With no other immediate commitments, Hoult began to look for other prospects. He was eventually cast in the role of <a href="Beast%20%28comics%29">Hank McCoy / Beast</a> for the <a href="X-Men%20%28film%20series%29">"X-Men" film series</a> owing to his ability to play somebody "gentle with a capability of being fierce". Although earlier reports had said <a href="Benjamin%20Walker%20%28actor%29">Benjamin Walker</a> was to play the role, Hoult was finalised for the 2011 <a href="Matthew%20Vaughn">Matthew Vaughn</a>-directed instalment "", a prequel to the franchise's earlier films. Before filming began, Hoult familiarised himself with his character; he said he "formulated [his] own version of the Beast" and took inspiration from <a href="Kelsey%20Grammer">Kelsey Grammer</a>'s performance in the previous "X-Men: The Last Stand" because he wanted to emulate Grammer's charm and eloquence. Hoult learnt to speak in a dialect similar to Grammer's without trying to imitate it. He also underwent physical training and gained weight to better suit his character. The film, which was widely praised by critics for its script and performances, performed moderately well at the box office, collecting about $353 million against a production budget of $160 million. Although it was the lowest-ranked production in the entire series in terms of revenue, Chris Aronson of <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a> deemed it "an excellent start to a new chapter of the franchise".

"Mad Max: Fury Road" was eventually filmed in 2012 in the <a href="Namibia">Namibian desert</a>. Miller had conceived Nux, a terminally ill slave, as a "quasi kamikaze pilot"; Hoult said of his character; "he's very enthusiastic and committed and affectionate but also kind of clumsy". Hoult shaved his head and followed a strict diet because his role required him to lose a lot of weight. He also talked about performing stunts in the film, describing the entire experience as "scary", but favourably compared the stunt crew and Miller's choice to incorporate real action sequences instead of using a <a href="green%20screen">green screen</a>, saying it made the performance more believable because the actors are placed in a real situation. "Fury Road" opened to critical acclaim on 14 May 2015 and grossed more than $378 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film in the "Mad Max" franchise. The technical aspects and stunt sequences drew particular praise from film critics and it was credited for reviving interest in the series. Shalini Langer noted that while the real hero of the film was Theron, "[Hoult] is the closest in the acting department [...] as Joe's "war boy" chasing imagined glory". Hoult's "fabulously unhinged" performance was also praised by <a href="Robbie%20Collin">Robbie Collin</a> of "The Daily Telegraph". Also in 2012, Hoult was included in the <a href="Forbes%2030%20under%2030">"Forbes" 30 under 30</a> list.

In 2013, Hoult had starring roles in two major films; he first played a <a href="zombie">zombie</a> named R in <a href="Jonathan%20Levine">Jonathan Levine</a>'s <a href="romantic%20comedy">romantic comedy</a> "<a href="Warm%20Bodies%20%28film%29">Warm Bodies</a>", which was released on 1 February. An adaptation of <a href="Isaac%20Marion">Isaac Marion</a>'s <a href="Warm%20Bodies">novel of the same name</a>, the film is presented from <a href="point%20of%20view%20%28literature%29">point of view</a> of the central character, mostly through narration. Levine said he had difficulties finding a suitable actor to play R until he met Hoult, who was attracted to the project—which he described as "much more than a horror movie" owing to the use of multiple pop culture and literary allusions—and even more so to the role which "bowled [me] over". Hoult said he drew inspiration from "<a href="Edward%20Scissorhands">Edward Scissorhands</a>" (1990) because he thought the central characters in both films share the same difficulties. To prepare for the role of a zombie, Hoult and the other actors practiced with <a href="Cirque%20du%20Soleil">Cirque du Soleil</a> performers; he said of the experience; "we would take our shoes off in a dance studio ... kind of grow out of the wall and make our bodies feel very heavy". The film garnered positive response from critics and audiences. Ben Kendrick praised Hoult for the restraint in a potentially <a href="Razzie%20Award">Razzie</a>-worthy role: "[he] brings a lot of life to R without stepping too far in the other direction [and although his] zombie mannerisms may come across a bit forced but, overall, his memorable moments outnumber (and outweigh) the awkward ones" Hoult was also described as "an extremely appealing actor, [who] is charm personified" in his role of the living-dead.

Hoult's next film, <a href="Bryan%20Singer">Bryan Singer</a>'s 2013 fantasy adventure "<a href="Jack%20the%20Giant%20Slayer">Jack the Giant Slayer</a>", failed at the box office and received mixed response from critics. He played <a href="Jack%20%28hero%29">the eponymous hero</a> in the film, which is based on the British fairy tales "<a href="Jack%20the%20Giant%20Killer">Jack the Giant Killer</a>" and "<a href="Jack%20and%20the%20Beanstalk">Jack and the Beanstalk</a>". Hoult's performance was poorly received by film critics Mary Pols, <a href="Justin%20Chang">Justin Chang</a> and <a href="Richard%20Roeper">Richard Roeper</a>; Pols was critical of his "disconcerting" imitation of Hugh Grant and the other two dismissed him and his character as "bland" and "boring", respectively.

Hoult then appeared in <a href="Jake%20Paltrow">Jake Paltrow</a>'s science-fiction film "<a href="Young%20Ones%20%28film%29">Young Ones</a>" (2014). Set in a dystopian future where water is scarce, the film had Hoult play Flem Lever, a young man who is trying to claim the land owned by the film's central character Ernest Holm (<a href="Michael%20Shannon">Michael Shannon</a>). Hoult thought the role was unlike any of his previous work and said his character's questionable choices throughout the film intrigued him. Hoult read novels written by <a href="S.%20E.%20Hinton">S. E. Hinton</a> to prepare for the role. The film was shot in a deserted location in South Africa; Hoult said filming in the hot weather conditions was difficult but the "beautiful" scenery helped to tell the story better. He and his co-star <a href="Elle%20Fanning">Elle Fanning</a> said it also made them more conscious of environmental concerns. The film premiered at the <a href="2014%20Sundance%20Film%20Festival">2014 Sundance Film Festival</a> and was met with mixed responses. Commentators highlighted the film's standout scenery but were critical of its plot. Keith Uhlich of "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" said Hoult was a poor fit for the story's "stoically retrograde machismo".

Hoult reprised his role as Hank McCoy in Bryan Singer's "", his only other release of 2014. Hoult said playing the character was a freeing experience for him and that it was "fun to suddenly be able to break loose ... when you're wearing the makeup ... you can perform big ... you get to have two very different techniques, performances". He also said the lengthy make-up procedure could last up to three and a half hours. "X-Men: Days of Future Past" earned more than $747 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film in the series and in Hoult's career at that time.

In 2015, Hoult had three other releasesthe <a href="Dark%20Places%20%282015%20film%29">feature film adaptation</a> of <a href="Gillian%20Flynn">Gillian Flynn</a>'s mystery novel "<a href="Dark%20Places%20%28novel%29">Dark Places</a>"; <a href="Owen%20Harris">Owen Harris</a>' <a href="dark%20comedy">dark comedy</a> "<a href="Kill%20Your%20Friends%20%28film%29">Kill Your Friends</a>", based on the 2008 novel of the same name; and "<a href="Equals%20%28film%29">Equals</a>", a dystopian, science-fiction <a href="romantic%20drama">romantic drama</a> directed by <a href="Drake%20Doremus">Drake Doremus</a>all of which were critical failures and rank among the lowest-grossing films of his career. Response to Hoult's performance in "Equals" was relatively better; Peter Travers dubbed him and his co-star Kristen Stewart "quietly devastating" and Katie Walsh, writing for "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>", said the duo were "finely matched both in their androgynous beauty and in their performances of a repressed humanity". Despite doubts about his contract with the franchise, Hoult returned for the 2016 film "". Upon release, the film became the third-ranked "X-Men" film in terms of worldwide box office collections, earning about $540 million. It was also a top-grossing production outside the United States.

The action film <a href="Collide%20%28film%29">"Collide"</a>, which had Hoult star as a drug dealer, was released in the United States in February 2017 to a poor response from audiences and critics. The film garnered negative reviews; its dismal box office performance was attributed to poor marketing and multiple delays caused by the 2015 <a href="chapter%2011%20bankruptcy">chapter 11 bankruptcy</a> of its production company <a href="Relativity%20Media">Relativity Media</a>. "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" Scott Mendelson analysed the film's failure and said Hoult did not necessarily have enough "star power" to draw audiences. He also responded negatively to <a href="Felicity%20Jones">Felicity Jones</a>' casting as a <a href="damsel%20in%20distress">damsel in distress</a>, which he said further damaged the film's chances of success. He highlighted the misogyny and sense of entitlement in the entertainment industry, writing that director <a href="Eran%20Creevy">Eran Creevy</a> and Hoult would get better offers despite the failure of films like "Collide", as opposed to the women and other <a href="minority%20group">minority group</a>s, who are either ignored or stereotyped. Responses to Hoult's next film, the romance drama "<a href="Newness">Newness</a>", were more enthusiastic. The production had its world premiere at the <a href="2017%20Sundance%20Film%20Festival">2017 Sundance Film Festival</a>; it stars Hoult and <a href="Laia%20Costa">Laia Costa</a> as a Los Angeles-based couple who meet through <a href="online%20dating">online dating</a> and begin an <a href="open%20relationship">open relationship</a>. Drake Doremus, the film's director, said Hoult's role was unlike his previous work; "a very complex and emotionally mature performance that we haven't seen yet".

Hoult starred in a series of biographical and historical films in 2017; he said he preferred playing characters that might help him improve as an actor and that the "actors I look up to started doing their best work in their early 30s and I'll be hitting that age  ... I'm just trying to learn". He portrayed American author <a href="J.%20D.%20Salinger">J. D. Salinger</a> in <a href="Danny%20Strong">Danny Strong</a>'s "<a href="Rebel%20in%20the%20Rye">Rebel in the Rye</a>", which chronicles Salinger's life from his youth to the <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> era and the years preceding the publication of his debut novel, "<a href="The%20Catcher%20in%20the%20Rye">The Catcher in the Rye</a>". Hoult auditioned for the role because he was intrigued by the film's script and Salinger's enigmatic personality; "I didn’t know he fought in the second world war and landed on D-Day: ... had intermittent PTSD or that he became interested in Vedanta philosophy and meditated and did yoga". To prepare for the role, Hoult read "The Catcher in the Rye" and biographies about Salinger. Hoult said the biggest challenge was to get a real understanding of Salinger's character; "everyone has an idea of [Salinger] in their mind ... you're creating a character that people have very strong feelings about. You can't prove to be right or wrong through impressions." "Rebel in the Rye" opened to a poor response from film critics. Carson Lund of "<a href="Slant%20%28magazine%29">Slant</a>" was largely unimpressed by Hoult's "feeble" performance and his inability to "reinvest the character with the complexities lost in the story’s programmatic telling". "<a href="RogerEbert.com">RogerEbert.com</a>"s Matt Fagerholm wrote that although Hoult was capable of illuminating the insecurities and fixations of his character, he is never "quite believable as Salinger". Fagerholm ascribed the failure to the script, which left the character's key motivations "frustratingly muddled".

Hoult co-starred with <a href="Benedict%20Cumberbatch">Benedict Cumberbatch</a> and <a href="Michael%20Shannon">Michael Shannon</a> in "<a href="The%20Current%20War">The Current War</a>", a dramatisation of the feud between electrical pioneers <a href="Thomas%20Edison">Thomas Edison</a> and <a href="George%20Westinghouse">George Westinghouse</a>, played by Cumberbatch and Shannon respectively. Hoult was cast in the role of <a href="Nikola%20Tesla">Nikola Tesla</a>, for which he grew a moustache and attended science lessons about electromagnetism and dynamos. He lost weight for his role by following a strict diet. Response to "The Current War" was mixed; David Ehrlich of <a href="IndieWire">IndieWire</a> described Hoult's performance as a tribute to <a href="David%20Bowie">David Bowie</a>, who had previously played Tesla in "<a href="The%20Prestige%20%28film%29">The Prestige</a>" (2006). In a departure from biographical dramas, Hoult next starred as an American soldier in "<a href="Sand%20Castle%20%28film%29">Sand Castle</a>", a production he described as a very different war film "in terms of the pacing and the emotion ... very under the surface, that futility-of-war idea". He recalled the filming experience in the Jordanian military bases practising clearing procedures: “we put on these masks, get given these guns, are put inside this pitch-black house ... try and hunt down these bad guys hiding inside. You’re in all the gear ... the adrenaline starts pumping". Released on Netflix in April 2017, the film garnered mixed reviews.

In 2018, he co-starred in the critically acclaimed period drama "<a href="The%20Favourite%20%28film%29">The Favourite</a>" as <a href="Robert%20Harley%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Oxford%20and%20Earl%20Mortimer">Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer</a>. He also appeared in the British-Irish-American animated <a href="Watership%20Down%20%28miniseries%29">television mini-series</a> adaptation of <a href="Richard%20Adams">Richard Adams</a>' 1972 novel "<a href="Watership%20Down">Watership Down</a>"; the mini-series is directed by <a href="Noam%20Murro">Noam Murro</a> and adapted by Tom Bidwell. He voiced one of the lead characters, <a href="Fiver%20%28Watership%20Down%29">Fiver</a>.

Hoult has completed filming the <a href="Tolkien%20%28film%29">J.R.R. Tolkien biographical film</a> in December 2017. Hoult will also reprise his role as Hank McCoy in the 2019 X-Men film "<a href="Dark%20Phoenix%20%28film%29">Dark Phoenix</a>".

Hoult dated American actress <a href="Jennifer%20Lawrence">Jennifer Lawrence</a>, his co-star in the "X-Men" films, for five years. Since March 2017, Hoult has been dating American model Bryana Holly Bezlaj. In April 2018, the couple had their first child, a boy.

During his childhood, Hoult played basketball for the <a href="Reading%2C%20Berkshire">Reading</a>-based team <a href="Reading%20Rockets">Reading Rockets</a>, which played in the <a href="English%20Basketball%20League">English Basketball League</a>. He was later appointed as the club's ambassador. He also follows <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> and has attended several Grand Prix events at <a href="Canadian%20Grand%20Prix">Montreal</a>, <a href="Singapore%20Grand%20Prix">Singapore</a>, and <a href="German%20Grand%20Prix">Germany</a>.

Hoult is a philanthropist and supports numerous charities; he has been associated with organisations that support children. He was appointed the first <a href="National%20Society%20for%20the%20Prevention%20of%20Cruelty%20to%20Children">National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children</a> (NSPCC) Young Person Ambassador, for supporting the charity's activities aimed at children and young people. Since 2009, he has also been involved with the <a href="Teenage%20Cancer%20Trust">Teenage Cancer Trust</a>; he continues to visit patients supported by the organisation and has helped promote its awareness campaigns, including the sun-safety campaign "Shunburn". Hoult designed sweaters for <a href="Save%20the%20Children">Save the Children</a>'s and Selfish Mother's joint Christmas Jumper Day campaign. He encouraged customers to buy the festive collection and support the charitable cause, which he thought would bring a "real change to children's lives". He also donated a pair of shoes, which was auctioned by Small Steps Project, an organisation that helps homeless and malnourished children. Hoult was inducted into the NSPCC Hall of Fame in 2010, for his contributions to the campaign against child cruelty.

Hoult visited <a href="Nairobi">Nairobi</a>, Kenya, as a part of a <a href="Christian%20Aid">Christian Aid</a> project aimed at providing clean water and sanitation. During his stay he met local people and helped clean the locality. He said of his experience; "I met great people making the best of the situation ... it is heart-breaking in many ways to see the living conditions". Hoult also participated in the <a href="Rickshaw%20Run">Rickshaw Run</a> in January 2017, in which participants drove an <a href="auto%20rickshaw">auto rickshaw</a> (also called a "tuk tuk") for across India to raise funds for Teenage Cancer Trust and <a href="World%20Wide%20Fund%20for%20Nature">World Wide Fund for Nature</a>. He has also been associated with Jeans for Refugees, a project and fundraising initiative intended to help refugees around the world. He donated a signed pair of jeans to the organisation; profits from the campaign were donated to the refugee support agency <a href="International%20Rescue%20Committee">International Rescue Committee</a>.

For his role in "About a Boy", Hoult won the Best Youth Performance at the Phoenix Film Critics Society Awards and earned a nomination for <a href="Critics%27%20Choice%20Movie%20Award%20for%20Best%20Young%20Performer">Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Young Performer</a>. He was nominated for the 2010 <a href="BAFTA%20Rising%20Star%20Award">British Academy Film Awards for Orange Rising Star Award</a> for his role in "A Single Man".

Siegfried "Sigi" Schmid (; March 20, 1953 – December 25, 2018) was a German-American <a href="Association%20football">soccer</a> <a href="Manager%20%28association%20football%29">coach</a> who had the most wins in the history of <a href="Major%20League%20Soccer">Major League Soccer</a> (MLS). Born in <a href="T%C3%BCbingen">Tübingen</a>, West Germany, he moved to the United States with his family when he was a child. He played college soccer from 1972 to 1975 at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Los%20Angeles">University of California, Los Angeles</a> (UCLA), where he was a starting <a href="midfielder">midfielder</a> in each of his four years. He coached his former college team, the <a href="UCLA%20Bruins%20men%27s%20soccer">UCLA Bruins</a>, between 1980 and 1999. During that period, he became one of the most successful collegiate coaches of all time, leading the Bruins to a record of 322–63–33 (wins–losses–draws). The team made 16 consecutive playoff appearances from 1983 to 1998, winning the <a href="NCAA%20Division%20I%20Men%27s%20Soccer%20Championship">national championship</a> in 1985, 1990, and 1997. Schmid also worked with <a href="United%20States%20Soccer%20Federation">U.S. Soccer</a> throughout the 1990s.

Schmid coached the <a href="LA%20Galaxy">Los Angeles Galaxy</a> and the <a href="Columbus%20Crew%20SC">Columbus Crew</a> in MLS, before becoming the head coach of <a href="Seattle%20Sounders%20FC">Seattle Sounders</a> in 2009. Despite never having played soccer at a professional level, he has the most coaching wins in MLS history and was the recipient of the <a href="MLS%20Coach%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">MLS Coach of the Year Award</a> in 1999 and 2008. Throughout his career, Schmid received praise from critics for his ability to identify new talent. His defensive tactics were also highly regarded in the press and often cited as a factor in his success. However, their deployment in his final two seasons with Los Angeles led directly to the termination of his contract.

After winning the <a href="MLS%20Cup">MLS Cup</a> with Columbus in 2008, Schmid was hired by the expansion Seattle Sounders as their first head coach. From 2009 to 2016, Schmid led the Sounders to seven playoff appearances, four <a href="Lamar%20Hunt%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup">Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup</a> titles, and an MLS <a href="Supporters%27%20Shield">Supporters' Shield</a> in 2014. After lackluster performances in the playoffs and missteps during the first half of the <a href="2016%20Major%20League%20Soccer%20season">2016 season</a>, Schmid left the club on mutual terms and was replaced by <a href="Brian%20Schmetzer">Brian Schmetzer</a> as interim head coach. Schmid joined <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> as a studio analyst and was named the head coach of Los Angeles once again in 2017, replacing <a href="Curt%20Onalfo">Curt Onalfo</a>. He resigned from the position in September 2018 and was replaced by assistant coach <a href="Dominic%20Kinnear">Dominic Kinnear</a>.

With <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Economics">Bachelor of Economics</a> and <a href="Master%20of%20Business%20Administration">Master of Business Administration</a> degrees from the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Los%20Angeles">University of California, Los Angeles</a> (UCLA), Schmid was a <a href="Certified%20Public%20Accountant">Certified Public Accountant</a> (CPA) before coaching full-time. Schmid and his wife had four children. Schmid died on December 25, 2018, weeks after being hospitalized in Los Angeles with a heart-related condition.

Sigi Schmid was born in <a href="T%C3%BCbingen">Tübingen</a>, West Germany, on March 20, 1953. At the age of four, he moved with his family to the United States; they took up residence in <a href="Torrance%2C%20California">Torrance, California</a>, in 1962. Schmid's father, Fritz, who had been a <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoner of war</a> during World War II, worked at <a href="Pabst%20Brewing%20Company">Pabst Brewing</a>; his mother, Doris, ran a Los Angeles-based German <a href="Delicatessen">deli</a>, where Schmid worked on weekends. Schmid's family spoke German at home, making him feel German despite spending so much of his life in America. He began school in the United States with little understanding of English and a <a href="stuttering">stuttering</a> speech disorder he did not overcome until high school. In his youth, Schmid visited Germany every summer, playing soccer with the local children and watching <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> clubs play exhibition matches in neighboring towns. In 1964, Schmid played for one of the inaugural <a href="American%20Youth%20Soccer%20Organization">American Youth Soccer Organization</a> teams, and was inducted into the AYSO Hall of Fame in 1996.

Despite Schmid's early soccer experience, his parents thought a career in the sport was unfeasible and encouraged him to pursue business. He enrolled at <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Los%20Angeles">UCLA</a> in 1972 and was a starting midfielder for the <a href="UCLA%20Bruins%20men%27s%20soccer">UCLA Bruins</a> from 1972 to 1975. In his first two seasons, the Bruins were national runners-up in the <a href="NCAA%20Division%20I%20Men%27s%20Soccer%20Championship">championships</a>, and advanced to the national semifinals in 1974. In his senior year, Schmid was selected to the 1975 All Far-West team. Schmid completed his playing career at UCLA ranked 11th in all-time assists at the school.

He received his <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Economics">Bachelor of Economics</a> degree in 1976 before earning a <a href="Master%20of%20Business%20Administration">Master of Business Administration</a> from the <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California">University of Southern California</a>. Between 1978 and 1984, he worked eight months of the year as a Certified Public Accountant (CPA).

Schmid's first coaching experience was in 1975 for <a href="Bishop%20Montgomery%20High%20School">Bishop Montgomery High School</a>. He also founded and coached a small club called the South Bay Vikings. Between 1977 and 1979, he served as an assistant coach under <a href="Steve%20Gay">Steve Gay</a> at UCLA. Schmid took over as head coach after Gay left the position in 1980. He began focusing solely on coaching before the 1984 season and was named "Coach of the Year" by the magazine "<a href="Soccer%20America">Soccer America</a>". UCLA then won the 1985 NCAA Division I championship by defeating <a href="American%20Eagles">American University</a> 1–0 after eight periods of <a href="overtime%20%28sports%29">overtime</a>. In his first 10 years as coach, the Bruins won or tied 85 percent of their games.

The Bruins won the 1990 national championship by defeating <a href="Rutgers%20Scarlet%20Knights%20men%27s%20soccer">Rutgers</a> 4–3 on <a href="Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29">penalty kicks</a> after a scoreless regulation, two sessions of overtime, and another two periods of <a href="Sudden%20death%20%28sport%29">sudden death</a>. During the 22-game season, UCLA outscored their opponents 61–16. The team continued to thrive in the following season, part of their success coming from Schmid's decision to move <a href="Cobi%20Jones">Cobi Jones</a> from a midfield position to forward. Jones later played for Schmid in the MLS and became a top player for the national team. Schmid was named the <a href="Mountain%20Pacific%20Sports%20Federation">Mountain Pacific Sports Federation</a> Coach of the Year for three years straight (1995–97), and NCAA Coach of the Year in 1997 after UCLA defeated the <a href="Virginia%20Cavaliers%20men%27s%20soccer">University of Virginia</a> to win a third NCAA championship. A reporter for the "<a href="Richmond%20Times-Dispatch">Richmond Times-Dispatch</a>" wrote that after winning just two titles in 17 postseason appearances, UCLA had finally shed "its 'underachiever' label". The writer also applauded Schmid's decision to move the team's leading <a href="Forward%20%28association%20football%29">striker</a> into a midfield position which led to the player scoring the winning goal.

Schmid spent 19 seasons as the head coach at UCLA, accumulating a record of 322–63–33 (wins–losses–draws), and reaching 16 consecutive playoffs between 1983 and 1998. He earned a reputation for producing some of the nation's best goalkeepers when <a href="David%20Vanole">David Vanole</a>, <a href="Brad%20Friedel">Brad Friedel</a>, and <a href="Matt%20Reis">Matt Reis</a> came through the university. By 1994, he had coached 16 players at UCLA who were later selected for the U.S. national team. Schmid avoided recruiting foreign talent to bolster his squad. He relied mainly on players from California, whom he believed to be less physically aggressive but more creative and attacking.
While coaching at UCLA, Schmid began to work with the <a href="United%20States%20men%27s%20national%20soccer%20team">U.S. national team</a>. He was the assistant coach at the 1991 World University Games and traveled with the team to Germany in the fall of 1992. In January 1993, he was selected as an assistant to <a href="Bora%20Milutinovi%C4%87">Bora Milutinović</a> for the <a href="1994%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1994 FIFA World Cup</a>, during which five of Schmid's UCLA players appeared for the national team. He continued as an assistant during the <a href="1995%20Pan%20American%20Games">1995 Pan American Games</a>. After being appointed U.S. Under-20 national team coach in January 1998, Schmid built his squad around <a href="Association%20football%20tactics%20and%20skills%23Tactics%20during%20a%20game%20situation">defensive tactics</a>. The team achieved second place in their <a href="Group%20tournament">group</a> during the <a href="1999%20FIFA%20World%20Youth%20Championship">1999 FIFA World Youth Championship</a>, defeating England and Cameroon, but were eliminated by the eventual champions Spain in the opening <a href="Tournament%23Knockout%20tournaments">knockout round</a>. Schmid returned to coach the U-20 national team at the <a href="2005%20FIFA%20World%20Youth%20Championship">2005 FIFA World Youth Championship</a>. The U.S. won the group in the opening stage of the tournament without conceding a goal, but lost to Italy in the first round of the knockout stage. One of the forwards on the national team, <a href="Eric%20Wynalda">Eric Wynalda</a>, said that Schmid's organization on the field was disciplined. Wynalda commented that Schmid had a "great handle on the defensive side of the game" while he also admired that the strikers were allowed to be creative. Schmid was inducted into the UCLA Hall of Fame in 2004 after working with UCLA, the national team, and the Los Angeles Galaxy.

Schmid left UCLA to replace <a href="Octavio%20Zambrano">Octavio Zambrano</a> as head coach of the Los Angeles Galaxy five games into the <a href="1999%20Major%20League%20Soccer%20season">1999 MLS season</a>. At the time, the team was ranked fifth in the <a href="Western%20Conference%20%28MLS%29">Western Conference</a> with a tally of only three goals. Under Schmid in the remainder of the season, the team had a record of 17–9, finished with the second-best record in the league and won their conference, earning him the <a href="MLS%20Coach%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">MLS Coach of the Year Award</a>. The team's captain, <a href="Robin%20Fraser">Robin Fraser</a>, gave credit to Schmid's emphasis on defense after being named the MLS defender of the year. Los Angeles lost 2–0 to <a href="D.C.%20United">D.C. United</a> in that year's MLS Cup. Schmid made critical comments of the <a href="Referee%20%28association%20football%29">referees</a> after the match; he received a $1,000 fine and suspension for the first game of the following season.

In <a href="2000%20Major%20League%20Soccer%20season">2000</a>, Schmid guided Los Angeles to the playoffs but lost in the semifinals to the <a href="Kansas%20City%20Wizards">Kansas City Wizards</a>. The team also played in that year's <a href="2000%20CONCACAF%20Champions%27%20Cup">CONCACAF Champions' Cup</a>, a competition consisting of the best clubs from North America, Central America, and the Caribbean. The Galaxy defeated the <a href="Liga%20Nacional%20de%20F%C3%BAtbol%20de%20Honduras">Honduran</a> champion <a href="Club%20Deportivo%20Olimpia">Olimpia</a> 3–2 to win the Cup. Schmid was forced to play an atypical squad since the final was held during the MLS off-season while adjustments to the following season's lineup were being made.

His successful team of <a href="2001%20Major%20League%20Soccer%20season">2001</a> enjoyed attacking play. The squad included experienced players such as Cobi Jones, <a href="Sasha%20Victorine">Sasha Victorine</a>, <a href="Luis%20Hern%C3%A1ndez%20%28footballer%29">Luis Hernández</a>, <a href="Simon%20Elliott">Simon Elliott</a>, and <a href="Mauricio%20Cienfuegos">Mauricio Cienfuegos</a>. The Galaxy won the conference by two points and finished fourth overall with a 14–7–5 record. The team went on to lose to the <a href="San%20Jose%20Earthquakes">San Jose Earthquakes</a> in the MLS Cup, but won the U.S. Open Cup a week later with a 2–1 overtime victory against the <a href="New%20England%20Revolution">New England Revolution</a>.
Success followed in <a href="2002%20Major%20League%20Soccer%20season">2002</a> when the Galaxy won the <a href="Supporters%27%20Shield">Supporters' Shield</a> for having the best regular season record in the league. Schmid was lauded for his defensive tactics after adjusting the team's standard formation to a <a href="3-5-2">3–5–2</a> early in the season. The shift allowed <a href="Alexi%20Lalas">Alexi Lalas</a> to play as a <a href="Sweeper%20%28football%29">sweeper</a> without specific <a href="Marking%20%28association%20football%29">marking</a> responsibilities in the three-man defensive line. Schmid also brought Guatemalan forward <a href="Carlos%20Ruiz%20%28Guatemalan%20footballer%29">Carlos Ruiz</a> to the team; Ruiz won league <a href="Major%20League%20Soccer%20MVP%20Award">Most Valuable Player</a> (MVP) award that year. Amidst criticism for failing to win in previous years, the franchise won its first MLS Cup with a 1–0 overtime victory against New England. The team again reached the Open Cup final but lost to the <a href="Columbus%20Crew%20SC">Columbus Crew</a>.

Victory in the MLS Cup earned the team another berth in the <a href="2003%20CONCACAF%20Champions%27%20Cup">2003 CONCACAF Champions' Cup</a>. Los Angeles advanced past <a href="C.D.%20Motagua">Motagua</a> in the first round but fell against <a href="Necaxa">Necaxa</a> in the quarterfinals. In <a href="2003%20Major%20League%20Soccer%20season">MLS</a>, the club had its first losing season with a 9–12–9 record and no victories on the road. The Galaxy failed to score goals consistently during the year, managing only a fourth-place finish in the five-team Western Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, Los Angeles defeated San Jose 2–0 in the first <a href="Two-legged%20tie">leg</a>, but during the second leg, conceded five goals in the second half of the match and were eliminated. Schmid was criticized by fans and the press speculated he would not return in 2004.<ref name="CNN/SI 2003-11-26"></ref> A local writer put some of the blame on a switch to defensive style of play while some players questioned his tactics. After it was announced that he would remain in his role next season, Schmid expected a year of rebuilding the team. The following year, he was picked to coach the Western Conference in the <a href="Major%20League%20Soccer%20All-Star%20Game">All-Star</a> game. Midway through the season, with the Galaxy in first place, Schmid was fired after a five-game stretch without any wins, in which the team scored only three goals. General manager Doug Hamilton said that the team had a mission "to compete for and win championships", and that "a more entertaining and attractive product on the field." was needed. Schmid left with an overall record of 79–53–32 with a 16–7–3 mark in the playoffs.

Reflecting on his demeanor in Los Angeles, Lalas said Schmid had "epic explosions". One reporter called him "combustible", while another referred to him as "fiery". Lalas also commented that playing for Schmid in Los Angeles required professionalism on and off the field.

Schmid returned to the league as coach of the Columbus Crew in <a href="2006%20Major%20League%20Soccer%20season">2006</a>, rated by the team's general manager Mark McCullers as "the best coach in America". The team contained young talent but lacked depth and had no star players. In August, after a streak of 13 winless matches, Schmid considered resigning. The team suffered from injuries and inconsistent lineups throughout the season, finishing last in the <a href="Eastern%20Conference%20%28MLS%29">Eastern Conference</a> with just 30 goals, the lowest in the league.

By the start of <a href="2007%20Major%20League%20Soccer%20season">2007</a>, Schmid had rebuilt the roster, keeping only three players he had inherited and acquiring Argentine attacker <a href="Guillermo%20Barros%20Schelotto">Guillermo Barros Schelotto</a>. Schmid cut the Crew's goalkeeper, <a href="Jon%20Busch">Jon Busch</a>, who had been with the team for five years. Schmid had concerns over Busch's playing style and fitness. Busch later criticized Schmid's management skills, and said he would never work for the coach again, but gave credit to Schmid's tactical approach. Scheletto's contributions were crucial to Columbus's improvement that season, but the team failed to make the playoffs. A writer for ESPN speculated that the Crew suffered because the team management would not spend more money, while Schmid lamented that he could not attract a <a href="Designated%20Player%20Rule">foreign star</a> to the little-known <a href="Columbus%2C%20Ohio">city of Columbus</a>.

The Crew's performance improved remarkably in the <a href="2008%20Major%20League%20Soccer%20season">2008 season</a>. Schmid adjusted their <a href="Association%20football%20tactics%20and%20skills%23Tactics%20during%20a%20game%20situation">offensive tactics</a> to be based on <a href="ball%20possession">ball possession</a> and flank speed. He made Schelotto a central part of the plan in a roaming playmaker position, a role in which Schelotto excelled and the Argentinian was named the league's MVP. With a 1–0 victory over the <a href="Houston%20Dynamo">Houston Dynamo</a> at <a href="Crew%20Stadium">Crew Stadium</a> on April 26, Schmid became the second MLS coach to win 100 regular-season games. The Crew went on to win the Supporters' Shield with the best record in the league. In the playoffs, Columbus defeated the <a href="New%20York%20Red%20Bulls">New York Red Bulls</a> 3–1 at Schmid's former home stadium, Los Angeles's <a href="Home%20Depot%20Center">Home Depot Center</a>, to win the MLS Cup. Schmid received the Coach of the Year Award for the second time. Part of the success was attributed to Schmid's restructuring of the squad in 2006 and 2007.

Schmid declined a contract offer from Columbus after the 2008 season and became coach of <a href="Seattle%20Sounders%20FC">Seattle Sounders</a>. The Crew's ownership believed that Schmid had been in contact with Sounders despite being denied permission to talk to other teams during the season. It was also alleged that he shared confidential information with Seattle after his contract with the Crew had ended. The MLS ruled that no tampering had occurred, but ordered Sounders FC to financially compensate the Crew.

Schmid was named the first coach of the new <a href="expansion%20franchise">expansion franchise</a>, Seattle Sounders FC. In their <a href="2009%20Seattle%20Sounders%20FC%20season">2009 inaugural season</a>, Seattle defeated D.C. United to win the U.S. Open Cup. On October 24, 2009, Seattle defeated <a href="FC%20Dallas">FC Dallas</a> 2–1, giving Schmid his 125th career MLS regular season win; this win moved Schmid past <a href="Bob%20Bradley">Bob Bradley</a> for the most wins in MLS history. He led Seattle to the playoffs where, in the first round, the Dynamo defeated the team 1–0 in overtime of the second leg. Seattle was the first expansion team to make the playoffs in an inaugural season since the 1998 <a href="Chicago%20Fire%20S.C.">Chicago Fire</a>, when the league was just two years old.
The team began the <a href="2010%20Major%20League%20Soccer%20season">2010 MLS season</a> slowly with injuries to key players that impacted Schmid's starting lineups. The team had a record of 4–8–3 over the first 15 games. The Sounders also advanced through the preliminary round of the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20CONCACAF%20Champions%20League">2010–11 CONCACAF Champions League</a> but failed to get past the group stage. The 2010 U.S. Open Cup campaign culminated in Schmid winning his third championship with a 2–1 victory over the Crew at Seattle's <a href="Qwest%20Field">Qwest Field</a>. No MLS team had previously won back-to-back Open Cups. The Sounders rebounded in the second half of the regular season with a 10–2–3 record to qualify for the playoffs. The team faced <a href="Bruce%20Arena">Bruce Arena</a>'s Galaxy in the two-legged quarter-final. Both coaches are considered to be among the best in the MLS, and it was the first meeting between the two in the playoffs. The Sounders lost by a 3–1 aggregate and Arena moved within one game of Schmid's MLS postseason record of 19 wins.

In 2011, Schmid's Sounders FC had many setbacks and a slow start to the season (the club won just 3 of its first 10 matches). Schmid signed a long-term contract extension on July 14, 2011, which could keep him with the club through the <a href="2015%20Major%20League%20Soccer%20season">2015 MLS season</a>. The extension is dependent on some club options and performance triggers. Although some fans had become frustrated with what they saw as tactical inflexibility and mismanagement of players, general manager <a href="Adrian%20Hanauer">Adrian Hanauer</a> praised Schmid's professionalism and success. The Sounders went on to finish the regular season with the second-best record in the league at 18 wins, 7 losses, 9 draws, and qualified for the playoffs for a third consecutive year. Schmid again led his club to the final of the U.S. Open Cup tournament. They defeated the <a href="Chicago%20Fire%20Soccer%20Club">Chicago Fire</a> 2–0 to become the first team since 1968 to win the tournament three times consecutively. Seattle also advanced to the knock-out stages of the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20CONCACAF%20Champions%20League">CONCACAF Champions League</a>. However, in the MLS playoffs, Sounders FC was again eliminated from the <a href="2011%20MLS%20Cup%20Playoffs">MLS Cup playoffs</a> in the conference semifinal round by Real Salt Lake.
In 2012, Seattle lost in the 2-legged <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20CONCACAF%20Champions%20League">2011–12 CONCACAF Champions League</a> quarter finals by an aggregate score of 7–3 to <a href="Club%20Santos%20Laguna">Santos Laguna</a>. The Sounders advanced to the finals of the Open Cup where they were defeated by Sporting Kansas City after penalty kicks. Schmid was furious over what he saw as a controversial call that handed Kansas City the victory. The team finished the <a href="2012%20Seattle%20Sounders%20FC%20season">regular season</a> with a 15–8–11 record to make the <a href="2012%20MLS%20Cup%20Playoffs">playoffs</a> where they advanced past Real Salt Lake to reach the conference championship series against the Galaxy. The team played defensive and suffered a 3–0 blowout in the first leg. They won on the return leg but lost on aggregate.

The Sounders began the <a href="2013%20Seattle%20Sounders%20FC%20season">2013 regular season</a> without a win until their sixth match. After advancing through the early stages of the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20CONCACAF%20Champions%20League">2012–13 CONCACAF Champions League</a> the year prior, Seattle lost in the semifinals to <a href="Santos%20Laguna">Santos Laguna</a>. The team was knocked out of the <a href="2013%20Lamar%20Hunt%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup">2013 Open Cup</a> in their first match against the lower division <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Rowdies">Tampa Bay Rowdies</a>. Seattle would rally during the middle of the season to put the Supporter's Shield and the regional Cascadia Cup in reach. However, the team ended the season on a skid of seven matches without a win that included substantial losses to both <a href="Colorado%20Rapids">Colorado</a> and rival <a href="Vancouver%20Whitecaps%20FC">Vancouver</a>. The Sounders beat Colorado in the knockout round of the <a href="2013%20MLS%20Cup%20Playoffs">2013 MLS Cup Playoffs</a> before losing two matches against arch-rival <a href="Portland%20Timbers">Portland</a>. At the end of the season, a poll in "<a href="The%20Seattle%20Times">The Seattle Times</a>" showed that many fans wanted to see Schmid fired. Pundits speculated on the possibility of his termination based on what they saw as poor tactics, a history of mismanaging skilled players, and a fan base that had higher expectations. Owner <a href="Joe%20Roth">Joe Roth</a> held a post-season meeting with Hanauer and Schmid. Roth later said that the possibility of Schmid losing his job was "close", but instead opted for personnel changes to the squad.

Consequently, Schmid met with a core group of players represented by <a href="Osvaldo%20Alonso">Osvaldo Alonso</a>, <a href="Clint%20Dempsey">Clint Dempsey</a>, and <a href="Brad%20Evans">Brad Evans</a>. The group agreed on changes to the team. Starting striker <a href="Eddie%20Johnson%20%28American%20soccer%29">Eddie Johnson</a> was later traded while a new central defender, winger, midfielder, goalkeeper, and depth at the forward position were brought in. The team played <a href="2014%20Seattle%20Sounders%20FC%20season">2014</a> with Dempsey and <a href="Obafemi%20Martins">Obafemi Martins</a> playing more through the middle as the Sounders won the <a href="2014%20Lamar%20Hunt%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup">US Open Cup</a> and the <a href="Supporters%27%20Shield">Supporters Shield</a>.
He spent part of the 2015–16 offseason with <a href="AS%20Roma">AS Roma</a> to study their training methods. During the first half of the 2016 season, the Sounders failed to meet expectations, placing near the bottom of the league with 6 wins, 12 losses, and 2 draws. After a 3–0 loss on July 24 to Sporting Kansas City, in which the Sounders had only one shot, Schmid left the club on mutual terms and was replaced by assistant coach <a href="Brian%20Schmetzer">Brian Schmetzer</a>.

After leaving the Sounders, Schmid joined <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> as a studio analyst.

On July 27, 2017, the LA Galaxy named Schmid as their new coach, replacing <a href="Curt%20Onalfo">Curt Onalfo</a>—the assistant coach and successor to Bruce Arena, who had departed the Galaxy in November 2016 to take over the United States men's national team. Under Onalfo, the Galaxy had lost half of their 20 matches and were on a five-match losing streak in mid-July, missing several key players to injuries. Schmid's first match for the Galaxy in 2017 ended in a scoreless draw against the Seattle Sounders, but the team would only win two matches before ending the season in last place—missing the playoffs for the first time since 2008 and the fourth time in their history.

Schmid was given greater powers related to player personnel decisions by the Galaxy, similar to that of Arena's tenure and replacing roles served by general manager <a href="Pete%20Vagenas">Pete Vagenas</a>, and looked to enter the 2018 season with a "winning" roster. During the offseason, the Galaxy overhauled its roster and declined to re-sign several starting players, including captain <a href="Jermaine%20Jones">Jermaine Jones</a> and homegrown player <a href="Gyasi%20Zardes">Gyasi Zardes</a>. Schmid replaced the core team with free agents and trades from other MLS teams, including <a href="Perry%20Kitchen">Perry Kitchen</a>, <a href="Chris%20Pontius%20%28soccer%29">Chris Pontius</a>, <a href="Ola%20Kamara">Ola Kamara</a>, and <a href="David%20Bingham%20%28soccer%2C%20born%201989%29">David Bingham</a>. The Galaxy also signed star striker <a href="Zlatan%20Ibrahimovi%C4%87">Zlatan Ibrahimović</a>, who Schmid hoped would be a "positive impact" on the team.

The Galaxy started the season with injuries to key players and some of its new arrivals. The team scored an early victory against new rival <a href="Los%20Angeles%20FC">Los Angeles FC</a> in the inaugural match of "<a href="El%20Tr%C3%A1fico">El Tráfico</a>", with Ibrahimović debuting as a substitute and leading the team to a 4–3 win. The Galaxy then slipped and lost four matches in a row, several by a single goal, but recovered and embarked on a nine-match unbeaten streak that lasted until August. The Galaxy then failed to win its next five matches under Schmid and slipped to eighth place in the Western Conference, conceding 11 goals in two away matches to Seattle and Salt Lake. Schmid resigned from the Galaxy on September 10, 2018, and was replaced by assistant coach <a href="Dominic%20Kinnear">Dominic Kinnear</a>. Kinnear replaced Schmid's 3–5–2 formation with a conventional 4–4–2 lineup and returned the team to playoff contention, but ultimately failed to clinch a playoff berth.

Schmid lived in <a href="Bellevue%2C%20Washington">Bellevue, Washington</a>, during the soccer season. He was married to Valerie Schmid and had four children: Erik, Lacey, Kurt, and Kyle. Kurt has been the head scout for Sounders FC and was also the Director of Player Personnel and Scouting for the L.A. Galaxy. Kyle played as a defender at <a href="UC%20Irvine%20Anteaters">UC Irvine</a> and was in the <a href="USL%20Premier%20Development%20League">USL Premier Development League</a> with <a href="Orange%20County%20Blue%20Star">Orange County Blue Star</a>. Kyle is now an assistant coach at <a href="Cal%20State%20Fullerton%20Titans">Cal State Fullerton</a>. Sigi rarely missed game days in MLS, but took time off for Lacey and Kurt's weddings and Kurt's college graduation. Schmid's younger brother, Roland, lived in <a href="Sammamish">Sammamish, Washington</a>, and having family in the area was one of the factors which persuaded Schmid to accept the Seattle job. After leaving the Galaxy in September 2018, Schmid stated that he planned to join another MLS club's front office or write a book.

Schmid was hospitalized several times during his later career, including once for a bout of <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> in 2009 and again for an undisclosed issue in 2015 that required him to miss a regular season match with the Sounders.

Schmid had weight and heart issues that later factored into his decision to retire from the LA Galaxy in 2018. Schmid was hospitalized on December 10, 2018, in Los Angeles and placed in intensive care at <a href="Ronald%20Reagan%20UCLA%20Medical%20Center">Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center</a> while awaiting a heart transplant. He died on December 25, 2018, at the age of 65. A <a href="memorial%20service">memorial service</a> was held in <a href="Manhattan%20Beach%2C%20California">Manhattan Beach, California</a>, on January 18, 2019.

Schmid has been described as one of the two "<a href="Godparent">godfathers</a>" of American soccer, alongside long-time rival <a href="Bruce%20Arena">Bruce Arena</a>, with connections to the coaching and technical staffs across MLS. In the days after his death, Schmid's contributions to the game and his treatment of players and coaches under his wing were highlighted in eulogies and memorials. On January 11, 2019, MLS announced that it would rename its <a href="Sigi%20Schmid%20Coach%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">Coach of the Year Award</a> to honor the Sigi Schmid Coach of the Year Award in honor of Schmid's contributions to the league.

Battle of Prokhorovka

The Battle of Prokhorovka was fought on 12 July 1943 near <a href="Prokhorovka%2C%20Belgorod%20Oblast">Prokhorovka</a>, southeast of <a href="Kursk">Kursk</a> in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. Taking place on the <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Eastern Front</a>, the engagement was part of the wider <a href="Battle%20of%20Kursk">Battle of Kursk</a>, and occurred when the <a href="5th%20Guards%20Tank%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">5th Guards Tank Army</a> of the Soviet <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> attacked the <a href="II%20SS%20Panzer%20Corps">II SS-Panzer Corps</a> of the German <a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a> in one of the largest <a href="armoured%20warfare">tank battles</a> in <a href="military%20history">military history</a>.

In April 1943, the German leadership began preparing for <a href="Operation%20Citadel">Operation Citadel</a>, with the objective of <a href="double%20envelopment">enveloping</a> and destroying the Soviet forces in the Kursk <a href="Salient%20%28military%29">salient</a>, by attacking and breaking through the base of the salient from north and south simultaneously. The German offensive was delayed several times due to the vacillation of the leadership and the addition of more forces and new equipment. The Soviet high command, <a href="Stavka">Stavka</a>, had learned of the German intentions, and therefore used the delay to prepare a series of defensive belts along the routes of the planned German offensive. The Soviet leadership also massed several armies deep behind their defences as the <a href="Stavka%20Reserve">Stavka Reserve</a>. This army group, the <a href="Steppe%20Front">Steppe Front</a>, was to launch counteroffensives once the German strength had dissipated. The 5th Guards Tank Army was the primary armoured formation of the Steppe Front.

On 5 July 1943 the Wehrmacht launched its offensive. On the northern side of the salient, the German forces bogged down within four days. On the southern side, the German <a href="4th%20Panzer%20Army">4th Panzer Army</a>, with <a href="Army%20Detachment%20Kempf">Army Detachment Kempf</a> on its eastern flank, attacked the Soviet defences of the <a href="Voronezh%20Front">Voronezh Front</a>. They made slow but steady progress through the Soviet defensive lines.

After a week of fighting, the Soviets launched their counteroffensives – <a href="Operation%20Kutuzov">Operation Kutuzov</a> on the northern side and a coinciding one on the southern side. On the southern side of the salient near Prokhorovka, the 5th Guards Tank Army engaged the II SS-Panzer Corps of the 4th Panzer Army, resulting in a large clash of <a href="armoured%20fighting%20vehicle">armour</a>. The 5th Guards Tank Army suffered significant losses in the attack, but succeeded in preventing the Wehrmacht from capturing Prokhorovka and breaking through the third defensive belt – the last heavily fortified one. The German high command, unable to accomplish its objective, cancelled Operation Citadel and began redeploying its forces to deal with new pressing developments elsewhere.

The Red Army went on a general offensive, conducting <a href="Operation%20Polkovodets%20Rumyantsev">Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev</a> on the southern side and continuing Operation Kutuzov on the northern side. The Soviet Union thus seized the strategic initiative on the Eastern Front, which it was to hold for the rest of the war.

After the conclusion of the <a href="Donets%20Campaign">battle for the Donets</a>, as the spring <a href="rasputitsa">rasputitsa</a> (mud) season came to an end in 1943, both the German and Soviet commands considered their plans for future operations. The <a href="Premier%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Soviet premier</a> <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> and some senior Soviet officers wanted to seize the initiative first and attack the German forces inside the Soviet Union, but they were convinced by a number of key commanders, including the Deputy Supreme Commander <a href="Georgy%20Zhukov">Georgy Zhukov</a>, to assume a defensive posture instead. This would allow the German side to weaken themselves in attacking prepared positions, after which the Soviet forces would be able to respond with a counter-offensive.

Strategic discussions also occurred on the German side, with <a href="Generalfeldmarschall">Field Marshal</a> <a href="Erich%20von%20Manstein">Erich von Manstein</a> arguing for a <a href="mobile%20defence">mobile defence</a> that would give up terrain and allow the Soviet units to advance, while the German forces launched a series of sharp counterattacks against their flanks to inflict heavy attrition. But for political reasons, <a href="Chancellor%20of%20Germany%23Chancellor%20of%20Nazi%20Germany%20%281933%E2%80%931945%29">German Chancellor</a> <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> insisted that the German forces go on the offensive, choosing the Kursk salient for the attack. On 15 April 1943 he authorised preparations for "Unternehmen Zitadelle" (<a href="Operation%20Citadel">Operation Citadel</a>).

The German offensive plan envisioned an assault at the base of the Kursk salient from both the north and south, with the intent of enveloping and destroying the Soviet forces in the salient. The two spearheads were to meet near Kursk. From the south, the <a href="XLVIII%20Panzer%20Corps">XLVIII Panzer Corps</a> and <a href="General%20%28Germany%29">General</a> <a href="Paul%20Hausser">Paul Hausser</a>'s <a href="II%20SS-Panzer%20Corps">II SS-Panzer Corps</a>, forming the left and right wings of the 4th Panzer Army commanded by <a href="Generaloberst">Colonel General</a> <a href="Hermann%20Hoth">Hermann Hoth</a>, would drive northward. The <a href="III%20Panzer%20Corps%20%28Wehrmacht%29">III Panzer Corps</a> of <a href="Army%20Detachment%20Kempf">Army Detachment Kempf</a> was to protect Hoth's right flank. The 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment Kempf were under <a href="Army%20Group%20South">Army Group South</a>, commanded by Manstein. Air support over the southern portion of the offensive was provided by Colonel General <a href="Otto%20De%C3%9Floch">Otto Deßloch</a>'s <a href="Luftflotte%204">Luftflotte 4</a> and its major air formation, the <a href="8th%20Air%20Corps%20%28Germany%29">8th Air Corps</a>. The German offensive, originally slated to commence in the beginning of May, was postponed several times as the German leadership reconsidered and vacillated over its prospects, as well as to bring forward more units and equipment.

The Soviet leadership, through their intelligence agencies and foreign sources, learned about the German intentions, and therefore the multiple delays by the German high command, <a href="Oberkommando%20der%20Wehrmacht">OKW</a>, allowed them a great deal of time to prepare their defences. Employing <a href="defence%20in%20depth">defence in depth</a>, they constructed a series of defensive lines to wear down the attacking <a href="panzer">panzer</a> formations. Three belts made up of extensive <a href="minefield">minefield</a>s, <a href="anti-tank%20ditch">anti-tank ditch</a>es, and <a href="anti-tank%20gun">anti-tank gun</a> emplacements were created; behind those were an additional three belts, which were mostly unoccupied and less fortified. The <a href="Voronezh%20Front">Voronezh Front</a>, commanded by <a href="Army%20general%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">General</a> <a href="Nikolai%20Vatutin">Nikolai Vatutin</a>, defended the southern face of the salient. The <a href="Steppe%20Front">Steppe Front</a>, commanded by <a href="Colonel%20General">Colonel General</a> <a href="Ivan%20Konev">Ivan Konev</a>, formed the strategic reserve. It was to be held back east of the salient until the time was right for the Soviet counteroffensive. This formation included <a href="Lieutenant%20General">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Alexei%20Zhadov">Alexei Zhadov</a>'s <a href="5th%20Guards%20Army">5th Guards Army</a> and Lieutenant General <a href="Pavel%20Rotmistrov">Pavel Rotmistrov</a>'s <a href="5th%20Guards%20Tank%20Army">5th Guards Tank Army</a>.

The Wehrmacht launched its attack on the morning of 5 July 1943 and met heavy resistance. There were far more Soviet anti-tank guns, minefields, anti-tank ditches and overall Soviet resistance than had been anticipated, making a breakthrough more difficult to achieve. Furthermore, from the outset they were subjected to frequent counterattacks from Soviet tank units. Despite this, by the end of 5 July the II SS-Panzer Corps had advanced through the first defensive belt on the southern side of the salient and reached the second, although the plan was to breach the first two belts and reach the third on the first day. Nonetheless, the panzer corps' penetration caused great concern among Soviet commanders, compelling Vatutin to commit almost all of Voronezh Front's operational reserves by the end of the first day.

The III Panzer Corps met with stiff resistance as well and had great difficulty creating and maintaining a bridgehead across the Northern <a href="Donets%20River">Donets River</a>. They eventually succeeded by the morning of 6 July, but the delay in their advance kept them from protecting the east flank of the II SS-Panzer Corps.

Late on 6 July, the 5th Guards Tank and the 5th Guards Armies of the Steppe Front began moving up from their reserve position. The 5th Guards Tank Army covered the over three days, and arrived at the Prokhorovka area on the night of 9 July, and the 5th Guards Army's <a href="33rd%20Guards%20Rifle%20Corps">33rd Guards Rifle Corps</a> arrived at the settlement on the night of 10 July. Both armies completed their journey and deployment intact without any substantial interference from the <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>.

Slow progress by the XLVIII Panzer Corps caused Hoth to shift elements of the II SS-Panzer Corps on 8 July to aid the XLVIII Corps' drive toward <a href="Oboyan">Oboyan</a> and Kursk. On the same day, the Soviet units counterattacked the II SS-Panzer Corps with several tank corps. These attacks did not destroy the panzer corps as hoped, but slowed its progress. By the end of 8 July, the II SS-Panzer Corps had advanced about and broken through the first and second defensive belts.

On the following day, 9 July, a meeting of the commanders of the German forces on the northern side of the Kursk salient concluded that a breakthrough on the northern side of the salient was unlikely. Nevertheless, they decided to continue their offensive to maintain pressure and inflict casualties, thereby tying down the Soviet forces there. Any level of success for Operation Citadel now depended on a breakthrough being achieved by 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment Kempf on the southern side of the Kursk salient.

On the evening of 9 July, the II SS-Panzer Corps was ordered to shift its own forward progress, from due north to the northeast, toward the settlement of Prokhorovka. Hoth had formulated this move, and had discussed it with Manstein since early May, as he expected large Soviet armoured reserve forces to arrive from the east, and he did not want his corps to be caught crossing the Psel River when they arrived. The plan originally envisioned elements of XLVIII Panzer Corps and III Panzer Corps joining in the attack toward Prokhorovka, but this could not be realised. The Soviet command, however, interpreted the change in direction to be a response to the heavy resistance the German forces had faced driving toward Oboyan, and incorrectly believed the change indicated the German panzer forces had been severely weakened.

Soviet intelligence reports issued from 8 to 9 July reported that defensive works were being constructed by German infantry on the flanks of the 4th Panzer Army, and that German armoured formations were not present in these locations, despite the fact that Soviet armoured formations were situated opposite these flanks. Voronezh Front headquarters supposed the Germans must be reaching their limit, and on 10 July decided to set its counterattack to coincide with the planned Soviet counteroffensive on the northern side of the Kursk salient, <a href="Operation%20Kutuzov">Operation Kutuzov</a>, which was set for 12 July.

Starting on the morning of 10 July, the II SS-Panzer Corps began its attack toward Prokhorovka. Its <a href="3rd%20SS%20Panzer%20Division%20Totenkopf">3rd SS-Panzergrenadier Division "Totenkopf"</a> attacked across the Psel River and secured a bridgehead. The <a href="1st%20SS%20Panzer%20Division%20Leibstandarte%20SS%20Adolf%20Hitler">1st SS-Panzergrenadier Division "Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler"</a> captured "Komsomolets" <a href="Sovkhoz">State Farm</a> and Hill 241.6. The <a href="2nd%20SS%20Panzer%20Division%20Das%20Reich">2nd SS-Panzergrenadier Division "Das Reich"</a> defended the panzer corps' flank from Soviet armoured counterattacks.

The II SS-Panzer Corps continued its attack toward Prokhorovka on 11 July. The advance of "Leibstandarte" was checked by the <a href="2nd%20Tank%20Corps%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">2nd Tank Corps</a>, which had been reinforced by the <a href="9th%20Guards%20Airborne%20Division">9th Guards Airborne Division</a> and 301st Anti-tank Artillery Regiment, both from the 33rd Guards Rifle Corps. "Totenkopf" was resisted by the 31st Tank Corps, the 33rd Guards Rifle Corps' 95th Guards Rifle Division, and the 11th Motorized Rifle Brigade of the 10th Tank Corps. To the south of "Leibstandarte", the 2nd Guards Tank Corps and the 48th Rifle Corps' 183rd Rifle Division opposed the advance of "Das Reich".

By day's end on 11 July "Leibstandarte" had advanced deep into the Soviet third defensive belt. They had moved up the Psel corridor, cleared Soviet resistance at the "Oktyabrsky" ("October") State Farm (), crossed a 15-foot (4.6 m)-deep anti-tank ditch at the base of Hill 252.2 and seized the hill itself after a brief but bloody battle, leaving them only south of Prokhorovka. To its northwest, the panzergrenadiers of "Totenkopf" had achieved a bridgehead across the Psel and tanks had been brought across, but they had yet to take Hill 226.6 and there was a gap between "Totenkopf" and "Leibstandarte". To the south of "Leibstandarte", "Das Reich" had also met stiff resistance and lagged behind some . With its advance, "Leibstandarte‍" was exposed on both of its flanks.

Late on 11 July the 5th Guards Tank Army prepared for its forthcoming counterattack. "Leibstandarte"s advance had disrupted Rotmistrov's preparations, as the assembly areas he intended to use for the tank army's 18th and 29th Tank Corps were in German hands by the end of the day, forcing him to hastily revise his plans and select new positions. The arrival of the 5th Guards Tank Army just days earlier was detrimental to it in two major ways: the tank unit commanders did not have an opportunity to reconnoitre the terrain they would be travelling across, and the supporting artillery was unable to site and spot their fire.

Late on the evening of 11 July, Hausser, the commander of the II SS-Panzer Corps, issued orders for the next day's advance on Prokhorovka. It was known that the Red Army had dug in many anti-tank guns on the southwest slopes of Prokhorovka, making a direct attack by "Leibstandarte" very difficult. The plan was for "Totenkopf" to capture Hill 226.6, and advance northeast along the Psel River to the Kartashёvka-Prokhorovka road, and then strike southeast into the flank and rear of Soviet forces at Prokhorovka. "Leibstandarte" was ordered to make a limited advance and secure Storozhevoe and Lamki just outside Prokhorovka, then it and "Das Reich" were to wait until "Totenkopf"s attack had disrupted the Soviet positions, after which "Leibstandarte" was to attack the main Soviet defences on the southwest slope of Prokhorovka. To "Leibstandarte"s right, elements of "Das Reich" were also to advance eastward to the high ground south of Prokhorovka, then turn south away from Prokhorovka to roll up the Soviet defences opposing the III Panzer Corps' advance and force a gap. The 8th Air Corps was to concentrate its effort to supporting the advance of the II SS-Panzer Corps, with the XLVIII Panzer Corps to the west assigned limited air resources.

The 5th Guards Army and 5th Guards Tank Army of the Steppe Front had been brought up from reserve and reassigned to the Voronezh Front on 8 and 11 July respectively. On 11 July, Vatutin ordered the armies of the Voronezh Front to go over to the offensive on the following day. This Soviet counterattack on the southern side of the Kursk salient was planned to coincide with the offensive against <a href="Oryol">Orel</a> on the northern side, Operation Kutuzov. Vatutin ordered Rotmistrov to destroy the German forces near Prokhorovka with his 5th Guards Tank Army, without allowing the German forces to withdraw southward.

For the battle, Rotmistrov ordered his tanks to move forward at high speed to engage the German armour in order to nullify the advantages the <a href="Tiger%20I">Tiger</a> tanks had in the range and firepower of their <a href="88%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bmm%20gun">88 mm gun</a>s. He believed the more manoeuvrable <a href="T-34">T-34</a> medium tanks would be able to quickly close in and obtain effective flanking shots against the German heavy tanks. In fact, Soviet intelligence had greatly overestimated the numbers of <a href="Elefant">Ferdinands</a> and Tigers possessed by the II SS-Panzer Corps. In actuality there were no Ferdinands with the 4th Panzer Army or Army Group South, as they were all deployed on the northern side of the Kursk salient with the 9th Army. Soviet tank-crews frequently mistook the versions of <a href="Panzer%20IV">Panzer IV</a> tanks that were armed with the <a href="KwK%2040">KwK 40</a> anti-tank gun, which also had extra armour added to their turret, for Tigers; therefore Soviet reports tended to overestimate the number of Tigers employed by the German side during the Battle of Kursk.

Soviet air support in the southern part of the salient was provided by the <a href="2nd%20Air%20Army">2nd Air Army</a> and the <a href="17th%20Air%20Army">17th Air Army</a>, commanded by Lieutenant General <a href="Stepan%20Krasovsky">Stepan Krasovsky</a> and Lieutenant General <a href="Vladimir%20Aleksandrovich%20Sudets">Vladimir Sudets</a>, respectively. However, the bulk of the air support was committed in support of Soviet units attacking XLVIII Panzer Corps to the west of Prokhorovka and the III Panzer Corps to the southeast, and only limited numbers of aircraft were available to support 5th Guards Tank Army's attack.

Rotmistrov's plans for a counterattack were threatened by events to the south. The III Panzer Corps managed to cross the Northern Donets at Rzhavets on the night of 11 July, and was about southeast of Prokhorovka, and advancing northwards. This threat jeopardised Rotmistrov's entire plan by threatening the flank and rear of the 5th Guards Tank Army. Early on 12 July, Vatutin ordered Rotmistrov to send reinforcements to the Soviet <a href="7th%20Guards%20Army">7th Guards</a> and <a href="69th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">69th</a> Armies facing the III Panzer Corps. He organised a task force under the command of his deputy, <a href="Major%20General">Major General</a> <a href="Kuzma%20Trufanov">Kuzma Trufanov</a>, which consisted of the 26th Guards Tank Brigade from the 2nd Guards Tank Corps, the 11th and 12th Guards Mechanized Brigades from the <a href="5th%20Guards%20Mechanized%20Corps">5th Guards Mechanized Corps</a>, and the 53rd Guards Tank Regiment of the 5th Guards Tank Army. Other units of the Voronezh Front also joined the group on its way south. In doing so, Rotmistrov committed over half of his army's reserves before the Battle of Prokhorovka had begun.

The German forces involved in the Battle of Prokhorovka were from the three <a href="Waffen-SS">Waffen-SS</a> divisions of the II SS-Panzer Corps: "Leibstandarte", "Das Reich", and "Totenkopf". On the evening of 11 July, the serviceable armour strength of the II SS-Panzer Corps was 294 tanks and <a href="assault%20gun">assault gun</a>s, which included 15 Tigers. The armoured strength of "Leibstandarte", "Das Reich", and "Totenkopf" were 77, 95, and 122 tanks and assault guns respectively. Ten of the Tigers were to the north of the Psel River with "Totenkopf", four were with "Leibstandarte", and "Das Reich" had just one.

"Leibstandarte" had advanced the most deeply toward Prokhorovka and was situated in the centre of the German position. A railway line, with a 30-feet high railbed, divided "Leibstandarte"s area into north and south. The bulk of the division was positioned to the north of the rail line, including the division's 1st SS-Panzer Regiment and 2nd SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment, as well as its reconnaissance, artillery and command units. To the south of the rail line was "Leibstandarte"s 1st SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment, along with the division's 1st SS-<a href="Panzerj%C3%A4ger">Panzerjäger</a> Battalion. "Das Reich" was positioned to the south of "Leibstandarte", and it protected the southern flank of the II SS-Panzer Corps. "Totenkopf" was positioned to the northwest of "Leibstandarte". "Totenkopf"s 3rd SS-Panzer Regiment had largely crossed over the Psel in preparation for the assault. "Leibstandarte" placed its lightly armed 1st SS-Panzer <a href="Aufkl%C3%A4rungsabteilung">Reconnaissance Battalion</a> in the gap between it and "Totenkopf" to provide some flank protection. The unit was, later on 12 July, buttressed by the division's four remaining Tigers, commanded by <a href="SS-Untersturmf%C3%BChrer">SS-Untersturmführer</a> <a href="Michael%20Wittmann">Michael Wittmann</a>.

The main Soviet armoured formation involved in the battle was the 5th Guards Tank Army, which controlled five corps, two of which were <a href="Guards%20unit">Guards unit</a>s, by 12 July: the 2nd Guards, 2nd, 5th Guards Mechanized, 18th and 29th Tank Corps. Altogether they fielded 793 tanks and 37 to 57 <a href="self-propelled%20gun">self-propelled gun</a>s for a total of approximately 840 armoured fighting vehicles. About two-thirds of these tanks were <a href="T-34">T-34</a>s, while the remainder were <a href="T-70">T-70</a> light tanks, with some 31 to 35 <a href="Churchill%20tank">Churchill heavy tank</a>s as well. Not all of the 5th Guards Tank Army was present in the Prokhorovka area during the battle, as part of the formation had been sent south to check the advance of the III Panzer Corps. The Soviet armour of the 5th Guards Tank Army – including the newly attached 2nd Guards Tank Corps and 2nd Tank Corps, as well as the 5th Guards Mechanized Corps held in reserve – that faced the II SS-Panzer Corps on 12 July was about 616 tanks and self-propelled guns. In addition, five artillery regiments, one artillery brigade, and one anti-aircraft artillery division were attached to the 5th Guards Tank Army for the assault.

The main attack of the 5th Guards Tank Army was conducted against "Leibstandarte" by its fresh 29th and 18th Tank Corps that had been brought up from the Soviet strategic reserve. These two Soviet tank corps together provided the greatest number of tanks in the attack, with the 18th Tank Corps fielding 190 tanks and self-propelled guns, and the 29th Tank Corps fielding 212 tanks and self-propelled guns. Infantry support to the 18th and 29th Tank Corps was provided by the 9th Guards Airborne Division. A portion of the 18th Tank Corps was directed against the eastern flank of "Totenkopf"s 6th SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment "Theodor Eicke". On the southeastern wing of the 5th Guards Tank Army, Rotmistrov deployed the 120 tanks of the 2nd Guards Tank Corps. Later on 12 July during the battle, the 26th Guards Tank Brigade of that tank corps with its estimated 40 tanks were sent south to face the III Panzer Corps. The remainder of the 2nd Guards Tank Corps, supported by the remnants of the 2nd Tank Corps, was to attack "Das Reich". Their infantry support was provided by the 183rd Rifle Division. The western flank of the 5th Guards Tank Army, which faced "Totenkopf", was defended by the 33rd Guards Rifle Corps' 42nd and 95th Guards Rifle Divisions, which were supported by the remnants of the 31st Tank Corps and the heavily depleted 23rd Guards Rifle Corps' 52nd Guards Rifle Division. The forces of the 5th Guards Mechanized Corps that were not sent south were held as reserve northwest of Prokhorovka, and they numbered about 113 tanks and self-propelled guns.

Vatutin directed Soviet air assets to commit their main effort toward checking the III Panzer Corps' drive northward, and in supporting the attack against the XLVIII Panzer Corps. Missions were flown in support of the attack of the 5th Guards Tank Army as well, but to a limited extent. The 2nd Air Army had some 472 aircraft operational on 12 July, while the 17th Air Army had 300 operational aircraft.

At 05:45 on 12 July, "Leibstandarte"s headquarters started receiving reports of the sound of many tank engines as the Soviet tanks moved into their assembly areas for the attack. At around 06:50, elements of "Leibstandarte"s 1st SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment nudged forward and drove the Soviet infantry out of Storozhevoe, while elements of the division's 2nd SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment fanned out from the "Oktyabrsky" State Farm. The Soviet forces began a preparatory artillery barrage at around 08:00, and as the last shells fell at 08:30, Rotmistrov radioed the code words "Stal! Stal! Stal!" ("Steel, Steel, Steel!") – the order to commence the attack. With that the Soviet armour of the 5th Guards Tank Army began their advance.

In total, about 500 tanks and self-propelled guns of the 5th Guards Tank Army attacked the positions of the II SS-Panzer Corps on 12 July, doing so in two waves, with 430 tanks in the first echelon and 70 more in the second.

Down from the slopes in front of Prokhorovka, the massed Soviet armour charged with five tank brigades of the 18th and 29th Tank Corps, firing as they came at "Leibstandarte"s positions. As the Soviet tanks rolled down the slopes, they carried the men of the <a href="9th%20Guards%20Airborne%20Division">9th Guards Airborne Division</a> on their hulls. The troops of "Leibstandarte" were not slated to go into action until later in the day. Exhausted from the previous week's fighting, many were just starting their day at the outset of the attack. As the Soviet armour appeared, German outposts all across the corps' frontage began firing purple warning flares signalling a tank attack. <a href="Obersturmbannf%C3%BChrer">Obersturmbannführer</a> <a href="Rudolf%20von%20Ribbentrop">Rudolf von Ribbentrop</a>, commander of a panzer company under the 1st SS-Panzer Regiment, stated that he knew at once a major attack was underway. He ordered his company of seven Panzer IVs to follow him over a bridge across an anti-tank ditch. Crossing the bridge they fanned out on the lower slope of Hill 252.2. On the crest of the hill, <a href="Sturmbannf%C3%BChrer">Sturmbannführer</a> <a href="Joachim%20Peiper">Joachim Peiper</a>'s 3rd Panzergrenadier Battalion of the 2nd SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment were being overrun.

As Ribbentrop's tanks spread out, he and the 1st SS-Panzer Regiment were suddenly confronted by Soviet tanks of the 29th Tank Corps' 31st and 32nd Tank Brigades: "About 150–200 meters in front of me appeared fifteen, then thirty, then forty tanks. Finally there were too many of them to count." The Soviet armour, firing on the move, charged down the western slopes of Hill 252.2 into the panzer company, and a tank battle ensued. Rotmistrov's tactic to close at high speed disrupted the control and co-ordination of the Soviet tank formations and also greatly reduced their accuracy. In a three-hour battle, the 1st SS-Panzer Regiment engaged the attacking Soviet tanks and repulsed them, reporting that they destroyed about 62 Soviet tanks. Later that afternoon, tanks from the 31st Tank Brigade and the 53rd Motorized Brigade overran elements of the 1st SS-Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion and reached "Komsomolets" State Farm, threatening "Leibstandarte" lines of communication and the division's command post located at Hill 241.6. The Soviet tanks attacked the division's 1st SS-Panzer Artillery Regiment, killing some of the crews before they themselves were destroyed by <a href="direct%20fire">direct fire</a> from anti-tank teams.

Wittmann's group of four Tigers provided support to the reconnaissance battalion in its effort to protect "Leibstandarte"s left flank, and faced off with the 18th Tank Corps' advancing 181st Tank Brigade. In a three-hour battle the Tigers engaged the Soviet tanks at ranges from 1,000 metres down to point-blank, inflicting heavy losses on the Soviet tankers and successfully repelling their attack. None of the Tigers were lost. Later, elements of the 170th Tank Brigade engaged the 1st SS-Panzer Regiment, which was already fighting the 31st and 32nd Tank Brigades. Despite losing its commander and about 30 tanks in the fight, by early afternoon the 170th Tank Brigade had forced the 1st SS-Panzer Regiment back to the "Oktyabrsky" State Farm and reached the position of the 1st SS-Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion. At around 18:00, the 170th and 181st Tank Brigades penetrated the German line connecting "Totenkopf" and "Leibstandarte". Assault guns and panzers supporting "Totenkopf"s 6th SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment "Theodor Eicke" repelled the Soviet attack and re-established the line, forcing the Soviet tanks to withdraw to the village of Andreevka.

The advance of Soviet armour down Hill 252.2 was disrupted when they reached the anti-tank ditch at the base of the hill. A number of tanks crashed into the 15-foot deep ditch while others moved along the edge looking for a way to cross. Heavy fire was exchanged between the Soviet tanks and two companies of a panzergrenadier battalion on the opposite side of the ditch. Peiper's surviving panzergrenadiers engaged the Soviet infantry and attacked the Soviet tanks with "<a href="Hafthohlladung">Hafthohlladung</a>" magnetic <a href="anti-tank%20grenade">anti-tank grenade</a>s. Twenty of his battalion's <a href="half-track">half-track</a>s were lost in the fighting, some destroyed in ramming the much heavier Soviet tanks in an effort to stop them. Eventually, due to heavy Soviet pressure and dangerously exposed flanks, "Leibstandarte" withdrew from the "Oktyabrsky" State Farm and established firmer defensive lines to the south.

The 2nd and 17th Air Armies flew 893 sorties compared to the German 8th Air Corps's 654 sorties over the southern part of the salient. Of note, most of the Soviet sorties flown that day were flown against the XLVIII Panzer Corps to the west and the III Panzer Corps to the south. Low clouds in the morning and thunderstorms in the afternoon inhibited air operations over Prokhorovka for both sides. Over the Prokhorovka battlefield the Luftwaffe gained control of the air. Formations of <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2087">Stukas</a>, including a small number of the G-2 variants, experimentally equipped with twin <a href="BK%2037">"Bordkanone" BK 3,7</a> cannon in <a href="gun%20pod">gun pod</a>s, that were commanded by <a href="Staffelkapit%C3%A4n">Staffelkapitän</a> <a href="Hans-Ulrich%20Rudel">Hans-Ulrich Rudel</a>, attacked the Soviet formations. They were joined by <a href="Focke-Wulf%20Fw%20190">Fw 190</a> single engine fighter-bombers and <a href="Henschel%20Hs%20129">Hs 129</a> twin-engined ground-attack aircraft, both equipped with anti-tank cannon.

The 31st Tank Brigade reported: "We suffered heavy losses in tanks through enemy artillery and aircraft. At 10:30 our tanks reached the "Komsomolets" State Farm, but due to continuous air attacks, they were unable to advance any further and shifted to the defence." The tank brigade also reported: "our own air cover was fully absent until 13:00." The 5th Guards Tank Army reported: "the enemy's aircraft literally hung above our combat formations throughout the entire battle, while our own aircraft, and particularly the fighter aviation, was totally insufficient."

By the end of the day, "Leibstandarte" still held Hill 252.2, but had been exhausted by the effort of turning back five Soviet tank brigades. To its left, "Totenkopf" had succeeded in capturing Hill 226.6 and had advanced along the northern bank of the Psel River to reach the Karteschevka–Prokhorovka road, northwest of Prokhorovka in accordance with plan. It was in position to outflank the Soviet forces at Prokhorovka, but was under pressure from Soviet attacks and its hold on the forward ground was tenuous. Forced onto the defensive by the attacks of the 2nd Guards and 2nd Tank Corps, "Das Reich" was unable to conduct its planned offensive manoeuvres.

On the Soviet side, all the tank units under Rotmistrov's 5th Guards Tank Army involved in the battle on 12 July suffered heavy losses. Rotmistrov later wrote that the 29th Tank Corps lost 60 percent of its armour and the 18th Tank Corps lost 30 percent on 12 July. A Soviet General Staff report recorded: "Thus on 12 July, the 5th Guards Tank Army failed to accomplish its assigned mission. As a result of the frontal attack, the army's corps fought heavy battles against large enemy tank forces during which they were forced to assume defence." Rotmistrov was forced to shift the 18th and 29th Tank Corps over to defence and reinforce them with infantry. They dug more trenches, dug in some of their tanks, laid new minefields, prepared anti-tank strong points and massed their artillery. The 10th Guards Mechanized and 24th Guards Tank Brigades of the 5th Guards Mechanized Corps made preparations to push "Totenkopf" back the next morning.

Stalin was very disappointed and infuriated by the early reports of heavy Soviet losses in the battle, and on the evening of 12 July he scolded Rotmistrov via a phone call. He considered sacking Rotmistrov and having him <a href="court-martialed">court-martialed</a>, but ended up not doing so. The same evening, he dispatched Zhukov, who had been overseeing Operation Kutuzov, to Vatutin's headquarters as <a href="Stavka">Stavka</a> representative, in order to assume control of coordinating the operations of the Voronezh and Steppe Fronts.

On the night of 12 July, Vatutin ordered Soviet forces to prevent any further German advance on Prokhorovka, destroy German forces that had advanced along the northern bank of the Psel River, and stop the III Panzer Corps from making further progress. Orders issued by the German command for 13 July instructed "Totenkopf" to consolidate its gains of the previous day and then attack into the flank and rear of the Soviet forces around Prokhorovka. "Leibstandarte" was to strengthen its front line and co-ordinate its attack on Prokhorovka from the south with "Totenkopf"s attack from the northwest. "Das Reich" was to consolidate and strengthen its front line and prepare for an offensive operation to link up with the III Panzer Corps.

On the morning of 13 July, the 10th Guards Mechanized and 24th Guards Tank Brigades, in cooperation with the 95th and 52nd Guards Rifle Corps, launched attacks against "Totenkopf". These Soviet attacks preoccupied "Totenkopf" and prevented it from attacking toward Prokhorovka. Around noon, "Leibstandarte"s 1st SS-Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion was ordered to attack northward toward the Psel River to consolidate its front line with "Totenkopf", while the division's panzer units were to attack toward Soviet positions northeast of the "Oktyabrsky" State Farm toward Prokhorovka.

The 1st SS-Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion attacked the defensive positions held by the 42nd Guards Rifle Division and the remaining armour of the 18th Tank Corps, while the panzer units attacked the defences of 9th Guards Airborne Division and the 29th Tank Corps. These German attacks were repelled by concentrated anti-tank artillery fire. The 29th Tank Corps responded with a counterattack and penetrated German lines, reaching "Komsomolets" State Farm before being beaten back by direct fire from German artillery. That afternoon, "Totenkopf" was ordered to abandon their positions northwest of Prokhorovka and return to tenable positions around Hill 226.6. Soviet attempts to sever the narrow salient were unsuccessful, and "Totenkopf" completed its withdrawal by nightfall.

On 13 July Hitler summoned Manstein and the commander of <a href="Army%20Group%20Center">Army Group Center</a> – Field Marshal <a href="G%C3%BCnther%20von%20Kluge">Günther von Kluge</a> – to his headquarters, the "<a href="Wolfsschanze">Wolfsschanze</a>" in <a href="East%20Prussia">East Prussia</a>. The <a href="Allied%20invasion%20of%20Sicily">Allied invasion of Sicily</a> on the night of 9–10 July, combined with the Soviet counteroffensive of Operation Kutuzov against the flank and rear of General <a href="Walter%20Model">Walter Model</a>'s <a href="9th%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">9th Army</a> on the northern side of the Kursk salient on 12 July, and the attacks by strong Soviet forces at Prokhorovka the same day had caused Hitler to stop the offensive and begin redeploying forces to the <a href="Mediterranean%20Theatre%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Mediterranean theatre</a>. He ordered his generals to terminate Operation Citadel.

Kluge welcomed the decision, as he was already in the process of withdrawing units of the 9th Army from the northern side of the Kursk salient to deal with Soviet attacks on his flank. But Manstein was greatly disappointed. He argued that his forces were now on the verge of achieving a major breakthrough on the southern side of the salient. As he saw it, with his III Panzer Corps about to link up with the II SS-Panzer Corps at Prokhorovka, and with the XXIV Panzer Corps available as his operational reserve, they would be halting the offensive just at the moment when victory was in hand. With an eye toward the west, Hitler was unwilling to continue the offensive. Manstein persisted, proposing that his forces should at least destroy the Soviet reserves in the southern Kursk salient before Citadel was finally terminated, so that the Soviet fighting capacity in the sector would be depleted for the rest of the summer. Hitler agreed to continue offensive operations in the southern salient until Manstein's goal was achieved.

After the meeting with Hitler on 13 July, Manstein hastily put together the plans for Operation Roland, realizing that he only had a few days to conduct the operation before he lost the II SS-Panzer Corps due to redeployment. The plan called for "Das Reich" to attack east and south and link up with III Panzer Corps, which would attack to the northwest. "Totenkopf" and "Leibstandarte" were to anchor the western and northern flanks of "Das Reich", respectively. Once the link was achieved and the Soviet forces encircled, Prokhorovka would then be attacked shortly thereafter by the combined forces of the II SS-Panzer Corps and III Panzer Corps. The goal of the operation was to destroy the Soviet armoured reserves massed in the southern sector of the Kursk salient, and thereby check Soviet offensive capacity for the rest of the summer.

The orders for Operation Roland were issued in the closing hours of 13 July 1943. But after meeting with Manstein, Hitler countermanded the XXIV Panzer Corps' deployment to the Kursk salient, sending them on 14 July to support the <a href="1st%20Panzer%20Army">1st Panzer Army</a> to the south. The assault began at 04:00 on 14 July. Following a brief artillery barrage, the 4th SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment "Der Führer" of "Das Reich" struck out for the high ground south-west of Pravorot, evicting the remnants of the 2nd Guards Tank Corps from the village of Belenikhino following house-to-house and hand-to-hand fighting. "Das Reich"s 2nd SS-Panzer Regiment fought off a series of counterattacks and forced the Red Army units to withdraw eastward to a new line. Zhukov ordered the 10th Guards Mechanized Brigade of the 5th Guards Mechanized Corps to reinforce the line. The 7th Panzer Division of the III Panzer Corps made contact with "Das Reich", but Trufanov, commanding the Soviet forces in the gap, was aware of the threat and conducted a fighting withdrawal. The link-up failed to trap the Soviet forces, though they abandoned a substantial number of their anti-tank guns. Operation Roland failed to produce a decisive result for the German side, and "Totenkopf" began withdrawing from its positions north of the Psel, following orders issued late on 15 July, as the II SS-Panzer Corps assumed a defensive stance along its entire front.

On 17 July the Soviet <a href="Southwestern%20Front%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">Southwestern</a> and <a href="Southern%20Front%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">Southern</a> Fronts launched a <a href="Donbass%20Strategic%20Offensive%20%28July%201943%29">major offensive</a> across the <a href="Mius">Mius</a> and Donets Rivers against the southern wing of Army Group South, pressing upon the <a href="6th%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">6th Army</a> and 1st Panzer Army. In the early afternoon of 17 July, Operation Roland was terminated with an order for the II SS-Panzer Corps to begin withdrawing from the Prokhorovka sector back to <a href="Belgorod">Belgorod</a>. The 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment Kempf anticipated the order and began executing it as early as the evening of 16 July. "Leibstandarte"s tanks were distributed between "Das Reich" and "Totenkopf", and the division was hastily redeployed to Italy, while "Das Reich" and "Totenkopf" were dispatched south to meet the new Soviet offensives.

Losses for 12 July are difficult to establish for either combatant. Tank losses attributed to the German side vary, in part due to the Wehrmacht's methodology for counting and reporting equipment losses. Only equipment that could not be repaired or that had to be abandoned were counted as losses, but damaged equipment that could be recovered and repaired were simply listed as such. Likewise, reliable figures for tank and personnel casualties for the Red Army in the Battle of Prokhorovka are difficult to establish.

The II SS-Panzer Corps reported 842 soldiers killed, wounded, or missing for 12 July, and 2,672 for 12 to 16 July inclusive. Since the German forces controlled much of the Prokhorovka battlefield until 17 July, they were able to recover most of their disabled armoured vehicles. The II SS-Panzer Corps' logistics report for 12 July did not record any confirmed permanent tank losses. Other German sources show that three tanks of the II SS-Panzer Corps (two Panzer IVs and a Tiger) that were immobilized in the battlefield could not be subsequently recovered and therefore the permanent losses can only be adjusted to a possible maximum of three tanks for 12 July. A study by the <a href="US%20Army%27s%20Center%20for%20Strategy%20and%20Force%20Evaluation">US Army's Center for Strategy and Force Evaluation</a> attributed six permanent tank losses, not counting <a href="Panzer%20I">Panzer I</a> and <a href="Panzer%20II">Panzer II</a> light tanks or German assault guns if any. Archival files of the II SS-Panzer Corps and 4th Panzer Army show that the II SS-Panzer Corps permanently lost 17 tanks and assault guns from 12 to 23 July inclusive, which therefore represents the maximum permanent losses the unit could have incurred for the engagement on 12 July up till the end of Operation Roland.

Archival data of the II SS-Panzer Corps shows that the corps had 294 operable tanks and assault guns on the evening of 11 July, and 251 on the evening of 13 July. Allowing for the possibility that some repaired tanks were returned to service on 13 July, these numbers indicate that at least 43 tanks and assault guns became inoperable during this period, which includes all ten Tigers belonging to "Totenkopf" and one belonging to "Leibstandarte". An estimated total of 60–80 tanks and assault guns of the II SS-Panzer Corps were damaged or destroyed in combat on 12 July. By the end of 16 July, the II SS-Panzer Corps had 292 serviceable tanks and assault guns, almost the same number it had at the beginning of the battle on 12 July. On 12 July, <a href="Schlachtgeschwader%201">Schlachtgeschwader 1</a> of the 8th Air Corps and its attached <a href="squadron%20%28aviation%29">squadron</a> of Stukas reported 11 aircraft damaged, all by Soviet <a href="anti-aircraft%20artillery">anti-aircraft artillery</a>, of which 6 were total write-offs.

A document prepared on 17 July 1943 by the 5th Guards Tank Army headquarters summarised the combat losses incurred by the formation from 12 to 16 July inclusive for all of its five corps, as well as smaller units directly subordinated to the army headquarters. The document reported the following irrecoverable losses: 222 T-34s, 89 T-70s, 12 Churchills, 8 <a href="SU-122">SU-122</a>s, 3 <a href="SU-76">SU-76</a>s, and 240 support vehicles. The document reported damaged vehicles still under repair as 143 T-34s, 56 T-70s, 7 Churchills, 3 SU-122s, and 3 SU-76s, with no figures for support vehicles. The document reported personnel casualties as 2,940 killed in action, 3,510 wounded in action, and 1,157 missing in action. This totals 334 irrevocable losses in tanks and self-propelled guns, with another 212 tanks and self-propelled guns under repair, and 7,607 casualties. The historian <a href="Karl-Heinz%20Frieser">Karl-Heinz Frieser</a> argued that the majority of the losses reported in the document must have occurred on 12 July.

Soviet personnel losses at Prokhorovka for 12 July were estimated by the historian Christer Bergström to have been as high as 5,500 men. For equipment damaged or destroyed, <a href="David%20Glantz">David Glantz</a> and <a href="Jonathan%20House">Jonathan House</a> estimate that the whole 5th Guards Tank Army lost at least 400 tanks in its attacks on 12 July. The Soviet historians Grigoriy Koltunov and Boris Soloviev estimate about 300 tanks and self-propelled guns of 5th Guards Tank Army were damaged or destroyed on 12 July. The study by the US Army's Center for Strategy and Force Evaluation reports that the 2nd Guards, 18th and 29th Tanks Corps altogether permanently lost 144 tanks on 12 July, not including self-propelled guns. George Nipe estimates that 600–650 tanks of the 5th Guards Tank Army were damaged or destroyed while fighting both the II SS-Panzer Corps and III Panzer Corps on 12 July.

Debate exists over the significance and outcome of the battle. The German forces destroyed many Soviet tanks and temporarily degraded the striking power of the 5th Guards Tank Army, but they were unable to take Prokhorovka or break through into open ground before developments elsewhere forced the termination of Operation Citadel. For the Soviet side, the massive armoured attack of 12 July failed to destroy the II SS-Panzer Corps, but succeeded in exhausting the Germans and eventually contributed to checking their advance. Thus, neither the 5th Guards Tank Army nor the II SS-Panzer Corps accomplished their objectives for 12 July.

While the battle is generally considered a tactical success for the German side due to the high numbers of Soviet tanks destroyed, in the wider perspective the Soviets successfully completed their defensive operation at Prokhorovka and created the conditions for their decisive counteroffensive, <a href="Operation%20Polkovodets%20Rumyantsev">Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev</a>, just as planned. Ultimately there was no German breakthrough at Prokhorovka or elsewhere in the Kursk salient, becoming the first time in the Second World War that a major German offensive was halted before it could break through enemy defences and penetrate into their operational or <a href="strategic%20depth">strategic depth</a>s. With the end of Operation Citadel, the strategic initiative permanently swung over to the Soviet Union for the rest of the war.

The battle has been widely described as the largest tank engagement or battle in military history, involving 1,200–1,500 tanks and sometimes up to 2,000, but this is incorrect as the battle did not involve that many tanks. The exaggerated figures originated from erroneous Soviet intelligence estimates of German armour reported during and after the battle, and subsequent postwar accounts that furthered this erroneous narrative. Some of these Soviet estimates reported figures as high as 800 German tanks and assault guns attacking Prokhorovka on 12 July.

Comparing both Soviet and German archives, the total number of tanks and other heavy armoured fighting vehicles, like assault guns or self-propelled guns, deployed by the 5th Guards Tank Army and the II SS-Panzer Corps around Prokhorovka during the battle numbered only about 910. In fact, the II SS-Panzer Corps never had the number of tanks and assault guns attributed to it by Soviet estimates at any point during Operation Citadel; not even at the start when it fielded only 494. Even if the battle was broadened to include the III Panzer Corps and the portion of the 5th Guards Tank Army that faced it, the total number of tanks and other heavy armoured fighting vehicles comes out at a maximum of 1,299. In contrast, for example, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Brody%20%281941%29">Battle of Brody</a> during <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">Operation Barbarossa</a> involved over 2,000 tanks, up to 6,000 tanks over the duration of the battle, engaged in combat over a 70-kilometre front. Nonetheless, the Battle of Prokhorovka is still regarded as one of the largest tank battles in military history.

High figures for tanks lost during the battle have been widely attributed to the Germans, but these are incorrect. For example, Rotmistrov in his postwar accounts of the battle stated that the Germans lost 350–400 tanks, including 70 Tigers, and 3,500–10,000 soldiers on 12 July, and a Soviet General Staff study of the Battle of Kursk reported that the Germans lost 300 tanks, 20 assault guns and over 4,500 soldiers in the battle from 12 to 16 July inclusive. However, archival data of the German units involved show that much lower losses were incurred during the battle.

The historians David Glantz and Jonathan House asserted that the original intention of the 4th Panzer Army command was to drive northwards, with its two panzer corps driving abreast, toward Oboyan and then Kursk; but that on 9 July, due to heavy Soviet resistance along the road to Oboyan, Hoth was forced to disastrously, although not knowing it at the time, alter his plan by ordering the II SS-Panzer Corps to swing from the northwesterly direction to the northeast toward Prokhorovka. Therefore, according to Glantz and House, the Battle of Prokhorova was not a result of original intention nor planned for, but was rather engendered by tactically flawed, late improvisations to the original German plan.

This narrative has been disputed by the historian Steven Newton, who dedicated a section of his 2002 publication about Operation Citadel to refuting it. Using first-hand accounts of German officers that executed Operation Citadel and scrutinizing Glantz and House's sources, Newton contended that the plan for the 4th Panzer Army to swing from the Oboyan direction to Prokhorovka was decided as early as May 1943, well before Operation Citadel even commenced, as German planners of Army Group South had always expected an encounter between the 4th Panzer Army and Soviet reserves that would arrive at the Psel River and Prokhorovka. Other historians have corroborated these conclusions. Newton also asserts that this has always been the accepted narrative in post-war literature.

Some historians state that the German troops did not expect the Soviet armoured counterattack and were taken by surprise on 12 July. However other historians have stated or argued that the German commanders were aware of, or at least anticipated, the Soviet armour that was massing around Prokhorovka, and therefore the troops could not have been genuinely surprised. The German historian Dieter Brand argues that even though the German commanders expected a major Soviet armoured deployment at Prokhorovka, the frontline German troops were indeed largely taken by surprise when the Soviets counterattacked on the morning of 12 July.

Richmond Bridge, London

Richmond Bridge is an 18th-century <a href="stone%20arch%20bridge">stone arch bridge</a> that crosses the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> at <a href="Richmond%2C%20London">Richmond</a>, connecting the two halves of the present-day <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Richmond%20upon%20Thames">London Borough of Richmond upon Thames</a>. It was designed by <a href="James%20Paine%20%28architect%29">James Paine</a> and <a href="Kenton%20Couse">Kenton Couse</a>.

The bridge, which is a <a href="listed%20building">Grade I listed</a>, was built between 1774 and 1777, as a replacement for a <a href="ferry">ferry</a> crossing which connected Richmond town centre on the east bank with its neighbouring district of East Twickenham to the west. Its construction was privately funded by a <a href="tontine">tontine</a> scheme, for which <a href="toll%20bridge">tolls</a> were charged until 1859. Because the river <a href="meander">meander</a>s from its general west to east direction, flowing from southeast to northwest in this part of London, what would otherwise be known as the north and south banks are often referred to as the "Middlesex" (Twickenham) and "Surrey" (Richmond) banks respectively, named after the <a href="Historic%20counties%20of%20England">historic counties</a> to which each side once belonged.

The bridge was widened and slightly flattened in 1937–40, but otherwise still conforms to its original design. The eighth Thames bridge to be built in what is now <a href="Greater%20London">Greater London</a>, it is today the oldest surviving <a href="List%20of%20crossings%20of%20the%20River%20Thames">Thames bridge</a> in London.

The small town of Sheen on the <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a> bank of the <a href="River%20Thames">Thames</a>, west of the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a> or by river, had been the site of a royal <a href="palace">palace</a> since 1299. After it was destroyed by fire in 1497, <a href="Henry%20VII%20of%20England">Henry VII</a> built a new palace on the site, naming it <a href="Richmond%20Palace">Richmond Palace</a> after his historic title of <a href="Earl%20of%20Richmond">Earl of Richmond</a>, and the central part of Sheen became known as <a href="Richmond%2C%20London">Richmond</a>.

Although a <a href="ferry">ferry</a> had almost certainly existed at the site of the present-day bridge since <a href="Normans">Norman</a> times, the earliest known crossing of the river at Richmond dates from 1439. The service was owned by the Crown, and operated by two boats, a small <a href="skiff">skiff</a> for the transport of passengers and a larger boat for horses and small <a href="cart">cart</a>s; the <a href="Twickenham%20Ferry">Twickenham Ferry</a>, slightly upstream, was also in service from at least 1652. However, due to the steepness of the hill leading to the shore-line on the Surrey side neither ferry service was able to transport <a href="carriage">carriage</a>s or heavily laden carts, forcing them to make a very lengthy detour via <a href="Kingston%20Bridge%2C%20London">Kingston Bridge</a>.

In the 18th century Richmond and neighbouring <a href="Twickenham">Twickenham</a> on the opposite bank of the Thames, both of which were distant from London but enjoyed efficient transport links to the city via the river, became extremely fashionable, and their populations began to grow rapidly. As the ferry was unable to handle large loads and was often cancelled due to weather conditions, the river crossing became a major traffic <a href="bottleneck%20%28traffic%29">bottleneck</a>.

Local resident William Windham had been sub-tutor to <a href="Prince%20William%2C%20Duke%20of%20Cumberland">Prince William, Duke of Cumberland</a>, and was the former husband of Mary, Lady Deloraine, mistress to <a href="George%20II%20of%20Great%20Britain">George II</a>. As a reward for his services, George II leased Windham the right to operate the ferry until 1798. Windham sub-let the right to operate the ferry to local resident Henry Holland. With the ferry unable to serve the demands of the area, in 1772 Windham sought Parliamentary approval to replace the ferry with a wooden bridge, to be paid for by tolls.

The plans for a wooden bridge proved unpopular, and in 1772 the <a href="Richmond%20Bridge%20Act%201772">Richmond Bridge Act</a> was passed by Parliament, selecting 90 commissioners, including landscape architect <a href="Lancelot%20%26quot%3BCapability%26quot%3B%20Brown">Lancelot "Capability" Brown</a>, historian and politician <a href="Horace%20Walpole%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Orford">Horace Walpole</a> and playwright and actor <a href="David%20Garrick">David Garrick</a>, to oversee the construction of a stone bridge on the site of the ferry. The Act stipulated that no tax of any sort could be used to finance the bridge, and fixed a scale of tolls, ranging from ½<a href="Penny%20%28British%20pre-decimal%20coin%29">d</a> for a pedestrian to 2<a href="Shilling%20%28British%20coin%29">s</a> 6d for a coach drawn by six horses (about 50p and £ respectively in 2019). Henry Holland was granted £5,350 (about £ in 2019) compensation for the loss of the ferry service. The commission appointed <a href="James%20Paine%20%28architect%29">James Paine</a> and <a href="Kenton%20Couse">Kenton Couse</a> to design and build the new bridge.
The Act specified that the bridge was to be built on the site of the existing ferry "or as much lower down the river as the Commission can settle". Local residents lobbied for it to be built at Water Lane, a short distance downstream from the ferry site. The approach to the river was relatively flat, avoiding the steep slope to the existing ferry pier on the Surrey bank. However, the <a href="Henrietta%20Pelham-Holles%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Newcastle-upon-Tyne">Dowager Duchess of Newcastle</a> refused to allow the approach road on the Middlesex bank to pass through her land at <a href="Twickenham%20Park">Twickenham Park</a>, and the commission was forced to build on the site of the ferry, despite a steep 1 in 16 (6.25%) incline.

The bridge was designed as a <a href="stone%20arch%20bridge">stone arch bridge</a> of in length and in width, supported by five elliptical arches of varying heights. The tall wide central span was designed to allow shipping to pass, giving Richmond Bridge a distinctive <a href="Humpback%20bridge">humpbacked</a> appearance. It was built in <a href="Portland%20stone">Portland stone</a>, and ran between Ferry Hill (Bridge Street today) on the Surrey side and Richmond Road on the Middlesex side; sharp curves in the approach roads on the Middlesex side (still in existence today) were needed to avoid the Dowager Duchess of Newcastle's land at Twickenham Park. <a href="Palladian%20architecture">Palladian</a> <a href="toll%20house">toll house</a>s were built in alcoves at each end.

The building was put out to tender, and on 16 May 1774 Thomas Kerr was awarded the contract to build the bridge for the sum of £10,900 (about £ in 2019). With additional costs, such as compensating landowners and building new approach roads, total costs came to approximately £26,000 (about £ in 2019).

Most of the money needed was raised from the sale of shares at £100 each (approximately £ in 2019) in two <a href="tontine">tontine</a> schemes, the first for £20,000 and the second for £5,000. The first was appropriately called the Richmond-Bridge Tontine, but when it became clear that the initial £20,000 would not be sufficient to complete construction a second tontine was set up. Each investor was guaranteed a return of 4% per annum, so £1,000 per annum from the income raised from tolls was divided amongst the investors in the two tontines. On the death of a shareholder their share of the dividend was divided among the surviving shareholders. To avoid fraud, each investor was obliged to sign an affidavit that they were alive before receiving their dividend. Any revenue over the £1,000 per annum required to pay the investors was held in a general fund for the maintenance of the bridge.

Construction began on 23 August 1774. The <a href="George%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prince of Wales</a> was invited to lay the first stone but declined, and so the stone was laid by commission member <a href="Henry%20Hobart%20%28MP%29">Henry Hobart</a>. The bridge opened to pedestrians in September 1776 and to other traffic on 12 January 1777, at which time the ferry service was closed, although work on the bridge was not completed until December 1777. A large <a href="milestone">milestone</a> was placed at the Richmond end, giving the distances to other bridges and to local towns.

There was no formal opening ceremony, and little initial recorded public reaction. However, the bridge soon became much admired for its design; an article in "<a href="The%20London%20Magazine">The London Magazine</a>" in 1779 said that the bridge was "a simple, yet elegant structure, and, from its happy situation, is ... one of the most beautiful ornaments of the river ... from whatever point of view the bridge is beheld, it presents the spectator with one of the richest landscapes nature and art ever produced by their joint efforts, and connoisseurs in painting will instantly be reminded of some of the best performances of <a href="Claude%20Lorrain">Claude Lorrain</a>e". James Paine proudly illustrated it among the designs in the second volume of his "Plans, Elevations, and Sections of Noblemen and Gentlemen's Houses", 1783. Richmond Bridge was the subject of paintings by many leading artists, including <a href="Thomas%20Rowlandson">Thomas Rowlandson</a>, <a href="John%20Constable">John Constable</a> and local resident <a href="J.%20M.%20W.%20Turner">J. M. W. Turner</a>.
Severe penalties were imposed for vandalising the bridge. The Richmond Bridge Act 1772 specified that the punishment for "willful or malicious damage" to the bridge should be "transportation to one of His Majesty's Colonies in America for the space of seven years". A warning against damage can still be seen on the milestone at the Surrey end of the bridge.

Richmond Bridge was a commercial success, generating £1,300 per annum in tolls (about £ in 2019) in 1810. By 1822, the company had accumulated a sufficient surplus that all vehicle tolls were reduced to one penny.
On 10 March 1859 the last subscriber to the main tontine died, having for over five years received the full £800 per annum set aside for subscribers to the first tontine, and with the death of its last member the scheme expired. On 25 March 1859 Richmond Bridge became toll-free. A large procession made its way to the bridge, where a team of labourers symbolically removed toll gates from their hinges. The toll houses were demolished, replaced by seating in 1868; investment income from the revenue accumulated during the 83 years the tolls had been charged was sufficient to pay for the bridge's maintenance.

In 1846 the first railway line reached Richmond. <a href="Richmond%20gasworks">Richmond gasworks</a> opened in 1848, and Richmond began to develop into a significant town. The <a href="District%20Railway">District Railway</a> (later the <a href="District%20line">District line</a>) reached Richmond in 1877, connecting it to the <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a>. Commuting to central London became feasible and affordable, leading to further population growth in the previously relatively isolated Richmond and Twickenham areas.

By the early 20th century the bridge was proving inadequate for the increasing traffic, particularly with the introduction of motorised transport, and a speed limit was enforced. With the remaining investment income from tolls insufficient to pay for major reconstruction, on 31 March 1931 the bridge was taken into the joint public ownership of Surrey and Middlesex councils, and proposals were made to widen it. The plans were strongly opposed on aesthetic grounds, and the decision was taken to build instead a new bridge a short distance downstream to relieve traffic pressure.
The new <a href="Twickenham%20Bridge">Twickenham Bridge</a> opened in 1933, but Richmond Bridge was still unable to handle the volume of traffic, so in 1933 <a href="Harley%20Dalrymple-Hay">Sir Harley Dalrymple-Hay</a> proposed possible methods for widening the bridge without significantly affecting its appearance. The cheapest of Dalrymple-Hay's proposals, to transfer the footpaths onto stone <a href="corbel">corbel</a>s projecting from the sides of the bridge thus freeing the entire width for vehicle traffic, was rejected on aesthetic grounds, and a proposal to widen the bridge on both sides was rejected as impractical. A proposal to widen the bridge on the upstream side was settled on as causing the least disruption to nearby buildings, and in 1934 it was decided to widen the bridge by , at a cost of £73,000 (about £ in 2019).

The <a href="Cleveland%20Bridge%20and%20Engineering%20Company">Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Company</a> of <a href="Darlington">Darlington</a> was appointed to carry out the rebuilding. In 1937 each stone on the upstream side was removed and numbered and the bridge widened; the stone facing of the upstream side was then reassembled and the bridge reopened to traffic in 1940. Throughout the redevelopment, a single lane of traffic was kept open at all times. It was found that the 18th-century foundations, consisting of wooden platforms sunk into the river bed, had largely rotted away, and they were reinforced with steel pilings and concrete foundations. During the widening works the opportunity was also taken to lower slightly the roadbed at the centre of the bridge and raise the access ramps, reducing the humpbacked nature of the bridge's central section.

James Paine went on to design three other Thames bridges after Richmond, at <a href="Chertsey%20Bridge">Chertsey</a> (1783), <a href="Kew%20Bridge">Kew</a> (1783), and <a href="Walton%20Bridge">Walton</a> (1788). Paine and Couse renewed their working relationship on the design of Chertsey Bridge, the only one of the three still in existence. Paine became <a href="High%20Sheriff%20of%20Surrey">High Sheriff of Surrey</a> in 1783.

In 1962, Richmond Council announced the replacement of the <a href="gas%20lighting">gaslamps</a> on the bridge with electric lighting. The <a href="Richmond%20Society">Richmond Society</a>, a local pressure group, protested at the change to the character of the bridge, and succeeded in forcing the council to retain the Victorian gas lamp-posts, converted to electric light, which remain in place today.

In the history of Richmond Bridge there have only been two reported serious collisions between boats and the bridge. On 20 March 1964, three boats tied together at <a href="Eel%20Pie%20Island">Eel Pie Island</a>, upstream, broke from their moorings in a storm and were swept downstream, colliding with the bridge. Although no serious damage was caused to the bridge, the "Princess Beatrice", an 1896 steamer once used by <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a>, was damaged beyond repair. On 30 January 1987, the "Brave Goose", the £3,500,000 <a href="yacht">yacht</a> of <a href="National%20Car%20Parks">National Car Parks</a> founder <a href="Donald%20Gosling">Sir Donald Gosling</a>, became wedged under the central arch of the bridge, eventually being freed at low tide the next day.
The eighth Thames bridge to be built in what is now <a href="Greater%20London">Greater London</a>, Richmond Bridge is currently the oldest surviving bridge over the Thames in Greater London, and the oldest Thames bridge between the sea and <a href="Abingdon%20Bridge">Abingdon Bridge</a> in Oxfordshire. Richmond Bridge was <a href="Grade%20I%20listed">Grade I listed</a> in 1952 and it is the only <a href="Georgian%20architecture">Georgian</a> bridge over the Thames in London. Its bicentenary was celebrated on 7 May 1977; the commemoration was held four months after the actual anniversary of 12 January, to avoid poor weather conditions.

The tradition of boat hire, repairs and boatbuilding continues at the bridge and tunnels at Richmond Bridge Boathouses under boatbuilder <a href="Mark%20Edwards%20%28boatbuilder%29">Mark Edwards</a>, awarded his <a href="MBE">MBE</a> in 2013 for 'services to boatbuilding' including construction of the <a href="Gloriana%20%28barge%29">Royal Barge Gloriana</a>.

Just to the south of the bridge, in a park at the Richmond end, is a bust of the first president of <a href="Chile">Chile</a>, <a href="Bernardo%20O%27Higgins">Bernardo O'Higgins</a>. He <a href="Clarence%20House%2C%20Richmond">studied in Richmond</a> from 1795 until 1798, and in 1998, 200 years after he left Richmond, the bust, whose sculptor is unknown, was unveiled. The patch of ground which the statue overlooks is called "O'Higgins Square". The Mayor of Richmond lays a wreath at the bust every year in the presence of staff from the <a href="Embassy%20of%20Chile%2C%20London">Chilean Embassy in London</a>.

Thomas of Bayeux

Thomas of Bayeux (died 1100) was <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a> from 1070 until 1100. He was educated at <a href="Li%C3%A8ge%20%28city%29">Liège</a> and became a royal chaplain to Duke William of Normandy, who later became King <a href="William%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI%20of%20England">William I of England</a>. After the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman Conquest</a>, the king nominated Thomas to succeed <a href="Ealdred%20%28archbishop%29">Ealdred</a> as Archbishop of York. After Thomas' election, <a href="Lanfranc">Lanfranc</a>, <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, demanded an oath from Thomas to obey him and any future Archbishops of Canterbury; this was part of Lanfranc's claim that Canterbury was the primary bishopric, and its holder the head of the English Church. Thomas countered that York had never made such an oath. As a result, Lanfranc refused to consecrate him. The King eventually persuaded Thomas to submit, but Thomas and Lanfranc continued to clash over ecclesiastical issues, including the primacy of Canterbury, which dioceses belonged to the province of York, and the question of how York's obedience to Canterbury would be expressed.

After King William I's death Thomas served his successor, <a href="William%20II%20of%20England">William II</a>, and helped to put down a rebellion led by Thomas' old mentor <a href="Odo%20of%20Bayeux">Odo of Bayeux</a>. Thomas also attended the trial for rebellion of the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Durham">Bishop of Durham</a>, <a href="William%20de%20St-Calais">William de St-Calais</a>, Thomas' sole <a href="Suffragan%20bishop">suffragan</a>, or bishop subordinate to York. During William II's reign Thomas once more became involved in the dispute with Canterbury over the primacy when he refused to consecrate the new Archbishop of Canterbury, <a href="Anselm%20of%20Canterbury">Anselm</a>, if Anselm was named the <a href="Primate%20of%20England">Primate of England</a> in the consecration service. After William II's sudden death in 1100, Thomas arrived too late to crown King <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry I</a>, and died soon after the coronation.

Thomas is sometimes referred to as Thomas I to distinguish him from his nephew <a href="Thomas%20II%20of%20York">Thomas</a>, who was also an Archbishop of York. The elder Thomas' father was a priest named Osbert; his mother was named Muriel, but little else of them is known. He had a brother named <a href="Samson%20%28Bishop%20of%20Worcester%29">Samson</a>, who was <a href="Bishop%20of%20Worcester">Bishop of Worcester</a> from 1086 until 1112. He was of Norman descent. Under the patronage of Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, both boys were sent to Liège for their education. Thomas may also have studied with Lanfranc in Normandy while the latter was teaching at the <a href="Bec%20Abbey">Abbey of Bec</a>, and some scholars contend that he also studied in Germany and Spain. Thomas then returned to <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a> to become one of Bishop Odo's officials and a chaplain, or secretary. He was a <a href="Canon%20%28priest%29">canon</a> and the treasurer of <a href="Bayeux%20Cathedral">Bayeux Cathedral</a> as well as a member of Duke William's ducal clergy before the Norman Conquest of England. The new King named him a royal clerk after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hastings">Battle of Hastings</a>.

Thomas succeeded Ealdred as Archbishop of York in 1070; he was nominated on 23 May and was probably consecrated on 25 December. The appointment of Thomas was a departure for the King, who had usually promoted Norman nobles or monks when he was still Duke of Normandy. The appointment was more consistent with English norms, as most of those appointed to the English episcopate before the Conquest had previously been royal clerks.

Shortly after Thomas' election, Lanfranc, pursuing a claim that Canterbury was the primatial <a href="Episcopal%20see">see</a>, or bishopric, of England, demanded that Thomas provide a written oath swearing to obey both Lanfranc and any future Archbishops of Canterbury. Thomas declined to make such a written promise, so Lanfranc refused to consecrate him. Thomas argued that Lanfranc's demand was unprecedented, as no other Archbishop of York had been required to swear such an oath before. King William wanted clear lines of authority in the church to match the lines of authority in the secular sphere; thus, the King supported Lanfranc in the dispute. Royal pressure induced Thomas to submit to Lanfranc and Thomas was consecrated, but his profession of obedience was made orally to Lanfranc personally and not in writing or to any future archbishops of Canterbury. Although this settled the issue between Thomas and Lanfranc, it was the beginning of the long-running <a href="Canterbury%E2%80%93York%20dispute">Canterbury–York dispute</a> over the claims of Canterbury to have jurisdiction over York.

The next year both archbishops travelled to Rome for their <a href="pallium">pallium</a>s, where Thomas took advantage of the opportunity to ask Pope <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20II">Alexander II</a> to decree that the sees of Canterbury and York were equal. Thomas also sought to have the pope declare that the midland sees of Worcester, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lincoln">Dorchester on Thames</a>, and <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lichfield">Lichfield</a>all south of the <a href="Humber">River Humber</a>were part of the Archdiocese of York rather than Canterbury. The 12th-century chronicler <a href="Eadmer">Eadmer</a>, a monk at Canterbury, wrote much later that Thomas had resigned and surrendered his archiepiscopal symbols, but they were promptly returned to him by Lanfranc on the pope's orders. The story's partisan source casts some doubt on its accuracy.

The pope referred the dispute to a council of English prelates, which met at <a href="Windsor%2C%20Berkshire">Windsor</a> during <a href="Pentecost">Whitsuntide</a> in 1072. The council decided that the Archbishop of Canterbury was the superior of the Archbishop of York and further ruled that York had no rights south of the Humber River. This meant that the disputed bishoprics were taken from the province of York, an outcome that probably had the support of the King, who aimed to prevent the separation of the north from the rest of England. By depriving the Archbishop of <a href="Suffragan%20Diocese">suffragans</a>, William limited York's power and separatist tendencies. The medieval chronicler <a href="Hugh%20the%20Chanter">Hugh the Chanter</a> commented that by requiring Thomas to obey Canterbury, the King removed the threat that Thomas might crown someone else as King of England – such as the Danish king. However, the council of Windsor also ruled that York's province included Scotland. Although Thomas was required to profess obedience to Lanfranc and Lanfranc's successors, the obedience did not mention nor was held to acknowledge any primacy of Canterbury, and it did not bind Thomas' successors.

All of these decisions were ratified in the <a href="Accord%20of%20Winchester">Accord of Winchester</a> that year, witnessed by the King and the <a href="papal%20legate">papal legate</a>, or representative of the pope, as well as many bishops and abbots. Thomas then made a written profession of obedience, some time after late May. Lanfranc wrote to Alexander II, attempting to get a written papal privilege of Canterbury's primacy, but Alexander replied that Lanfranc must personally resubmit the case to the papal court before a papal privilege could be issued. Alexander died in 1073. His successor, Pope <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20VII">Gregory VII</a>, was opposed to the idea of primacies, and the matter of the papal privilege for Canterbury went nowhere. In 1073, with the help of <a href="Wulfstan%20%28Bishop%20of%20Worcester%29">Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester</a> and <a href="Peter%20of%20Lichfield">Peter, Bishop of Chester</a>, Thomas consecrated Radulf as <a href="Bishop%20of%20Orkney">Bishop of Orkney</a> in an attempt to increase York's authority in Scotland. Wulfstan often performed episcopal functions in parts of the diocese of York during the 1070s for Thomas, especially in areas that were still in turmoil after the conquest.

Thomas reorganised the <a href="cathedral%20chapter">cathedral chapter</a> during his archiepiscopate, establishing a group of secular canons with individual <a href="prebend">prebend</a>s to provide the clergy with income. The cathedral chapter at York had until then lived in a group, but Thomas' reforms allowed the clergy to live in their own houses. Thomas also set up a number of officials within the cathedral chapter, including a <a href="Dean%20%28religion%29%23Catholic%20Church">dean</a>, treasurer, and <a href="precentor">precentor</a>. He increased the number of clergy in the chapter, increasing it from the three he found at York when he took office, and reorganised the episcopal and chapter's estates, giving a number of estates to the chapter. He introduced the continental system of <a href="Archdeacon%23Catholic%20Church">archdeacons</a> to the Diocese of York, dividing the diocese into territorial units and appointing an archdeacon to each. Archdeacons were responsible for aiding the bishop or archbishop with his episcopal duties, collecting revenues, and presiding over some judicial courts.

Shortly before Thomas' appointment, <a href="York%20Minster">York Minster</a>, the cathedral of the archdiocese, was damaged in a fire that swept through York on 1069, and which also destroyed the <a href="refectory">refectory</a> and dormitory for the canons. Soon after his consecration, Thomas had a new dormitory and refectory built and a new roof put on the cathedral; these appear to have been temporary measures however, as some time later, probably in about 1075, he ordered the construction of a new cathedral on a different site. The new building, much larger than the one it replaced, has not survived. It was excavated between 1966 and 1973, showing the plan of the cathedral to be different from most others built in England around that time. It was longer, had no aisles in the nave, and it had a rectangular ring crypt that had been long out of style in 1075. Because of the way the foundations were laid out, it appears likely that the entire building was planned and built in one design phase, with few modifications. It may have been that Thomas designed his cathedral to be as unlike <a href="Canterbury%20Cathedral">Canterbury Cathedral</a> as possible, perhaps because of the conflict between York and Canterbury over primacy. <a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a>, a 12th-century writer, states that Thomas finished the cathedral, and this is corroborated by the fact that Thomas was buried in the minster in 1100. Some elements of Thomas' structure are still visible in the crypt of York Minster.

After the death of the Conqueror, Thomas was loyal to the third son, William Rufus, who had inherited England instead of the eldest brother, <a href="Robert%20Curthose">Robert Curthose</a>. Thomas supported Rufus despite a rebellion led by his old mentor Odo of Bayeux, and the Archbishop accompanied the King on his campaigns to put down the revolt. Thomas attended the subsequent trial for rebellion in 1088 of William de St-Calais, Bishop of Durham, who had sided with Odo. William was Thomas' sole suffragan bishop, but it was Thomas who pronounced the sentence of the court.

In 1092 and again in 1093 the dispute with Canterbury resurfaced, when Thomas complained about what he felt were infringements of York's rights. The first of these occasions was over the dedication of <a href="Remigius%20de%20F%C3%A9camp">Remigius de Fécamp</a>'s new cathedral at <a href="Lincoln%2C%20Lincolnshire">Lincoln</a> and the second concerned the consecration of Anselm as Archbishop of Canterbury. Thomas refused to consecrate Anselm if the latter was referred to as Primate of England. The impasse was finally resolved by naming Anselm the <a href="Metropolitan%20bishop">Metropolitan</a> of Canterbury. The medieval chronicler Eadmer, Anselm's biographer and a Canterbury partisan, says that Anselm was consecrated as the primate. Hugh the Chanter, who was a member of the York community, stated that the metropolitan title was used. Modern historical opinion is divided, with <a href="Frank%20Barlow%20%28historian%29">Frank Barlow</a>, author of "The English Church 1066–1154" inclined towards the primatial title, but with <a href="Richard%20Southern">Richard Southern</a>, in his biography of Anselm, leaning towards the metropolitan title. The whole affair is probably subject to much duplicity and dishonesty, with both sides presenting biased accounts.

<a href="Herbert%20de%20Losinga">Herbert de Losinga</a> was appointed a papal legate in 1093 by Pope <a href="Pope%20Urban%20II">Urban II</a> to investigate the matter of Thomas' profession of obedience to Lanfranc. Herbert seems to have done nothing about investigating the issue. Also in 1093, King William II gave the Archbishops of York the right to appoint the <a href="Abbot">Abbot</a> of <a href="Selby%20Abbey">Selby Abbey</a> in compensation for the loss of York's claim to the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Lincoln">Diocese of Lincoln</a>. While Anselm was in exile after quarrelling with the King in 1097, Thomas consecrated Herbert de Losinga as <a href="Bishop%20of%20Norwich">Bishop of Norwich</a>, <a href="Ralph%20de%20Luffa">Ralph de Luffa</a> to the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Chichester">See of Chichester</a>, and <a href="Hervey%20le%20Breton">Hervey le Breton</a> as <a href="Bishop%20of%20Bangor">Bishop of Bangor</a>, an unusual step because these dioceses were in Canterbury's province, and it was Anselm's right to consecrate the new bishops. In 1100 after the sudden death of King William II and the seizure of power by the King's younger brother <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry</a>, Thomas arrived in London too late to crown Henry I, as the ceremony had already been performed by Maurice, <a href="Bishop%20of%20London">Bishop of London</a>, in the absence of both archbishops. Anselm at this time was still in exile. Thomas was initially angry at the slight, until it was explained to him that the King had worried over the chance of disorder in the kingdom if there was a delay. To mollify him, Thomas was allowed to crown the King publicly at a church council held soon after the coronation.

Thomas died at York on 18 November 1100. He was considered to have been an excellent archbishop, and ensured his cathedral clergy were well cared for. He repaired the cathedral and did much to promote trade in the city of York. Thomas also helped to advance the careers of his family; one of his nephews, <a href="Thomas%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII%20of%20York">Thomas II of York</a>, became Archbishop of York in 1108, and another, Richard, became <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Bayeux">Bishop of Bayeux</a> in 1107.

During his lifetime, Thomas was praised for his learning, his encouragement of education in his diocese, and his generosity. He was an excellent singer and composed hymns. In his youth, he was known for having a sturdy build, and in his old age he had a ruddy complexion and snow white hair.

Thomas composed the epitaph placed on William the Conqueror's tomb in <a href="Abbaye-aux-Hommes">St. Etienne</a> in Caen, but the chronicler <a href="Orderic%20Vitalis">Orderic Vitalis</a> felt that Thomas was chosen more for his rank than for his skill in composition. Thomas did not concern himself with the church–state issues surrounding the <a href="Investiture%20Controversy">Investiture Crisis</a>, but he was tenacious in defending the independence of York against the efforts of Canterbury to assert primacy over the whole of England. Later authors, including William of Malmesbury and Hugh the Chantor, praised Thomas for his generosity, chastity, elegance, and charm.

Abū Bakr Muḥammad ibn Ṭughj ibn Juff ibn Yiltakīn ibn Fūrān ibn Fūrī ibn Khāqān (8 February 882 – 24 July 946), better known by the <a href="laqab">title</a> <a href="Ikhshid">al-Ikhshīd</a> () after 939, was an <a href="Abbasid%20Caliphate">Abbasid</a> commander and governor who became the autonomous ruler of <a href="Egypt%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages">Egypt</a> and parts of <a href="Bilad%20al-Sham">Syria</a> (or <a href="Levant">Levant</a>) from 935 until his death in 946. He was the founder of the <a href="Sunni%20Islam">Sunni</a> <a href="Ikhshidid%20dynasty">Ikhshidid dynasty</a>, which ruled the region until the <a href="Fatimid%20Caliphate">Fatimid</a> conquest of 969.

The son of <a href="Tughj%20ibn%20Juff">Tughj ibn Juff</a>, a general of <a href="Turkic%20peoples">Turkic</a> origin who served both the Abbasids and the autonomous <a href="Tulunids">Tulunid</a> rulers of Egypt and Syria, Muhammad ibn Tughj was born in <a href="History%20of%20Baghdad%23Center%20of%20learning%20%288th%20to%209th%20centuries%29">Baghdad</a> but grew up in Syria and acquired his first military and administrative experiences at his father's side. He had a turbulent early career: he was imprisoned along with his father by the Abbasids in 905, was released in 906, participated in the murder of the <a href="vizier">vizier</a> <a href="al-Abbas%20ibn%20al-Hasan%20al-Jarjara%27i">al-Abbas ibn al-Hasan al-Jarjara'i</a> in 908, and fled <a href="History%20of%20Iraq%23Middle%20Ages">Iraq</a> to enter the service of the governor of Egypt, <a href="Takin%20al-Khazari">Takin al-Khazari</a>. Eventually he acquired the patronage of several influential Abbasid magnates, chiefly the powerful commander-in-chief <a href="Mu%27nis%20al-Muzaffar">Mu'nis al-Muzaffar</a>. These ties led him to being named governor first of <a href="Jund%20Filastin">Palestine</a> and then of <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a>. In 933, he was briefly named governor of Egypt, but this order was revoked after the death of Mu'nis, and Ibn Tughj had to fight to preserve even his governorship of Damascus. In 935, he was re-appointed to Egypt, where he quickly defeated a Fatimid invasion and stabilized the turbulent country. His reign marks a rare period of domestic peace, stability and good government in the annals of early Islamic Egypt. In 938 Caliph <a href="al-Radi">al-Radi</a> granted his request for the title of "al-<a href="Ikhshid">Ikhshid</a>", which had been borne by the rulers of his ancestral <a href="Farghana%20Valley">Farghana Valley</a>. It is by this title that he was known thereafter.

Throughout his governorship, al-Ikhshid was engaged in conflicts with other regional strongmen for control over Syria, without which Egypt was vulnerable to invasion from the east, but unlike many other Egyptian leaders, notably the Tulunids themselves, he was prepared to bide his time and compromise with his rivals. Although he was initially in control of the entirety of Syria, he was forced to cede the northern half to <a href="Muhammad%20ibn%20Ra%27iq">Ibn Ra'iq</a> between 939 and 942. Following Ibn Ra'iq's murder, al-Ikhshid reimposed his control over northern Syria, only to have it challenged by the <a href="Hamdanid%20dynasty">Hamdanids</a>. In 944 al-Ikhshid met Caliph <a href="al-Muttaqi">al-Muttaqi</a> at <a href="Raqqa">Raqqa</a>; the caliph had fled there from the various strongmen vying to kidnap him and control the caliphal government in Baghdad. Although unsuccessful in persuading the caliph to come to Egypt, he received recognition of hereditary rule over Egypt, Syria and the <a href="Hejaz">Hejaz</a> for thirty years. Following his departure, the ambitious Hamdanid prince <a href="Sayf%20al-Dawla">Sayf al-Dawla</a> seized <a href="Aleppo">Aleppo</a> and northern Syria in the autumn of 944, and although defeated and driven out of Syria by Ibn Tughj himself in the next year, a treaty dividing the region along the lines of the agreement with Ibn Ra'iq was concluded in October. Ibn Tughj died nine months later, leaving his son <a href="Abu%27l-Qasim%20Unujur%20ibn%20al-Ikhshid">Unujur</a> as ruler of his domains, under the tutelage of the powerful black eunuch <a href="Abu%20al-Misk%20Kafur">Abu al-Misk Kafur</a>.

According to the biographical dictionary compiled by <a href="Ibn%20Khallikan">Ibn Khallikan</a>, Muhammad ibn Tughj was born in <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> on 8 February 882, on the street leading to the <a href="Kufa">Kufa</a> Gate. His family was of <a href="Turkic%20peoples">Turkic</a> origin from the <a href="Farghana%20Valley">Farghana Valley</a> in <a href="Transoxiana">Transoxiana</a>, and claimed royal descent; the name of his ancestor, "<a href="Khaqan">Khaqan</a>", is a Turkic royal title. Muhammad's grandfather Juff left Farghana to enter military service in the <a href="Abbasid%20Caliphate">Abbasid</a> court at <a href="Samarra">Samarra</a>, as did the father of <a href="Ahmad%20ibn%20Tulun">Ibn Tulun</a>, the founder of the <a href="Tulunid%20dynasty">Tulunid dynasty</a>. Juff and his son, Muhammad's father <a href="Tughj%20ibn%20Juff">Tughj</a>, both served the Abbasids, but Tughj later entered the service of the Tulunids, who since 868 had become autonomous rulers of <a href="Egypt%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages">Egypt</a> and <a href="Bilad%20al-Sham">Syria</a>. Tughj served the Tulunids as governor of <a href="Tiberias">Tiberias</a> (capital of the <a href="jund">district</a> of <a href="Jund%20al-Urdunn">Jordan</a>), <a href="Aleppo">Aleppo</a> (the capital of the district of <a href="Jund%20Qinnasrin">Qinnasrin</a>) and <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a> (capital of the <a href="Jund%20Dimashq">homonymous district</a>). He played a major role in repelling the <a href="Qarmatians">Qarmatian</a> attack on Damascus in 903; although defeated in battle, he held the city itself against the Qarmatians for seven months until, with the arrival of reinforcements from Egypt, the Qarmatians were driven away. Thus Muhammad ibn Tughj spent a great part of his youth in the Tulunid Levant at his father's side, gaining his first experiences in administration—he served as his father's sub-governor of Tiberias—and war.

After the death of Ibn Tulun's son <a href="Khumarawayh%20ibn%20Ahmad%20ibn%20Tulun">Khumarawayh</a> in 896, the Tulunid state quickly began crumbling from within, and failed to put up any serious resistance when the Abbasids moved to re-establish direct control over Syria and Egypt in 905. Tughj defected to the invading Abbasids under <a href="Muhammad%20ibn%20Sulayman%20al-Katib">Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Katib</a>, and was named governor of Aleppo in return; Muhammad al-Katib himself fell victim to court intrigues soon after, and Tughj along with his sons Muhammad and <a href="Ubayd%20Allah%20ibn%20Tughj">Ubayd Allah</a> were imprisoned in Baghdad. Tughj died in prison in 906, and the brothers were freed shortly after. The sons of Tughj participated in the palace coup that tried to depose the new caliph, <a href="al-Muqtadir">al-Muqtadir</a> (reigned 908–932), in favour of the older <a href="Abdallah%20ibn%20al-Mu%27tazz">Ibn al-Mu'tazz</a> in December 908. Although the attempt failed, Muhammad ibn Tughj and his brother were able to avenge themselves for their imprisonment on the <a href="vizier">vizier</a> <a href="al-Abbas%20ibn%20al-Hasan%20al-Jarjara%27i">al-Abbas ibn al-Hasan al-Jarjara'i</a>, whom they struck down with the aid of <a href="Husayn%20ibn%20Hamdan">Husayn ibn Hamdan</a>. After the coup's failure, the three fled: Ibn Hamdan returned to his native <a href="Upper%20Mesopotamia">Upper Mesopotamia</a> and Ubayd Allah fled east to <a href="Yusuf%20ibn%20Abi%27l-Saj">Yusuf ibn Abi'l-Saj</a>, while Muhammad fled to Syria.

In Syria, Muhammad ibn Tughj joined the service of the tax supervisor of the local provinces, Abu'l-Abbas al-Bistam. He soon followed his new master to Egypt, and after al-Bistam's death in June 910 he continued serving the latter's son. Eventually, he gained the attention of the local governor, <a href="Takin%20al-Khazari">Takin al-Khazari</a>, who sent him to govern the lands beyond the <a href="Jordan%20River">Jordan River</a>, with his seat at <a href="Amman">Amman</a>. In 918, he rescued a "<a href="hajj">hajj</a>" caravan, among which was one of the ladies-in-waiting of al-Muqtadir's mother, from <a href="Bedouin">Bedouin</a> raiders, thereby improving his standing at the Abbasid court. Two years later, Ibn Tughj gained an influential patron when he briefly served under the powerful Abbasid commander-in-chief <a href="Mu%27nis%20al-Muzaffar">Mu'nis al-Muzaffar</a>, when he came to help defend Egypt from a <a href="Fatimid%20Caliphate">Fatimid</a> invasion. During the campaign, Ibn Tughj commanded the finest troops of the Egyptian army. The two men evidently established a rapport, and remained in contact thereafter.

When Takin returned to Egypt as governor in 923, Ibn Tughj joined him there, but the two men fell out in 928 over Takin's refusal to give Ibn Tughj the post of governor of <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>. Ibn Tughj escaped the capital <a href="Fustat">Fustat</a> by a ruse, and managed to obtain for himself an appointment as governor of <a href="Jund%20Filastin">Palestine</a> from Baghdad; the incumbent, al-Rashidi, fled the governor's seat at <a href="Ramla">Ramla</a> for Damascus, whose governorship he assumed. His flight, according to historian Jere L. Bacharach, may indicate that Ibn Tughj commanded a significant military force. Three years later, in July 931, Muhammad ibn Tughj was promoted to governor of Damascus, while al-Rashidi returned to Ramla. Both these appointments were likely the result of Ibn Tughj's relation with Mu'nis al-Muzaffar, who at this time was at the zenith of his power and influence.

Takin died in March 933, and his son and nominated successor, Muhammad, failed to establish his authority in Egypt. Ibn Tughj was named as the new governor in August but the appointment was revoked a month later before he could reach Egypt, and <a href="Ahmad%20ibn%20Kayghalagh">Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh</a> was appointed in his place. The timing of Ibn Tughj's recall coincides with the arrest (and subsequent murder) of Mu'nis by Caliph <a href="al-Qahir">al-Qahir</a> (r. 932–934) on 22 September, suggesting that Ibn Tughj's nomination was in all likelihood also due to Mu'nis. The fact that al-Qahir sent a eunuch called Bushri to replace Ibn Tughj in Damascus after the fall of Mu'nis reinforces this view. Bushri was able to take over the governorship of Aleppo (to which he also had been appointed), but Ibn Tughj resisted his replacement, and defeated and took him prisoner. The caliph then charged Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh with forcing Ibn Tughj to surrender, but although Ahmad marched against Ibn Tughj, both avoided a direct confrontation. Instead, the two men met and reached an agreement of mutual support, upholding the status quo.

Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh soon proved incapable of restoring order to the increasingly turbulent province. By 935, the troops were rioting over lack of pay, and Bedouin raids had recommenced. At the same time, Takin's son Muhammad and the fiscal administrator <a href="Abu%20Bakr%20Muhammad%20ibn%20Ali%20al-Madhara%27i">Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Ali al-Madhara'i</a>—the heir of a <a href="al-Madhara%27i">dynasty of bureaucrats</a> that had handled the province's finances since the time of Ibn Tulun and amassed enormous wealth—undermined Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh and coveted his position. Infighting broke out among the troops between the Easterners ("Mashariqa"), chiefly Turkish soldiers, who supported Muhammad ibn Takin, and the Westerners ("Maghariba"), probably <a href="Berber%20people">Berbers</a> and <a href="Black%20African">Black African</a>s, who backed Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh. With the support this time of the former vizier and inspector-general of the western provinces <a href="al-Fadl%20ibn%20Ja%27far%20ibn%20al-Furat">al-Fadl ibn Ja'far ibn al-Furat</a>, whose son was married to one of Ibn Tughj's daughters, Ibn Tughj was once more named the governor of Egypt. Taking no chances, Ibn Tughj organized an invasion of the country by land and sea. Although Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh was able to delay the advance of the army, Ibn Tughj's fleet took <a href="Tinnis">Tinnis</a> and the <a href="Nile%20Delta">Nile Delta</a> and moved on to the capital Fustat. Outmanoeuvred and defeated in battle, Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh fled to the Fatimids. The victorious Muhammad ibn Tughj entered Fustat on 26 August 935.

With the capital under his control, Ibn Tughj now had to confront the Fatimids. The "Maghariba" who refused to submit to Ibn Tughj had fled to Alexandria and then to <a href="Barqa">Barqa</a> under the leadership of Habashi ibn Ahmad, and invited the Fatimid ruler <a href="Al-Qa%27im%20bi-Amr%20Allah">al-Qa'im</a> (r. 934–946) to invade Egypt with their assistance. The Fatimid invasion met with initial success: the Fatimid army's <a href="Kutama">Kutama</a> Berbers captured the island of <a href="Rhoda%20Island">al-Rawda</a> on the <a href="Nile">Nile</a> and burned its arsenal. Ibn Tughj's admirals Ali ibn Badr and Bajkam defected to the Fatimids, and Alexandria itself was captured in March 936. Nevertheless, on 31 March, Ibn Tughj's brother al-Hasan defeated the Fatimid forces near Alexandria, driving them out of the city and forcing the Fatimids to once again retreat from Egypt to their base at Barqa. During the campaign, Ibn Tughj notably prohibited his troops from looting, which, according to J. L. Bacharach, was indicative of his "long-term view towards his stay in Egypt".

Writing to Caliph <a href="Ar-Radi">al-Radi</a> (r. 934–940) in 936, Muhammad ibn Tughj could present a commendable record: the Fatimid invasion was defeated and first measures for improving the financial situation in the province had been undertaken. The caliph confirmed him in his post and sent robes of honour. As <a href="Hugh%20N.%20Kennedy">Hugh N. Kennedy</a> writes, "in some ways the Fatimid threat actually helped Ibn Tughj" since, as long as he supported the Abbasids, "the caliphs were prepared to give their approval to his rule in return". His standing in the Abbasid court was sufficient for him to ask in 938 for the honorific title ("<a href="laqab">laqab</a>") of "al-<a href="Ikhshid">Ikhshid</a>", originally held by the kings of his ancestral homeland Farghana. Caliph al-Radi granted the request, although formal approval was delayed until July 939. After receiving official confirmation, Ibn Tughj required that he be henceforth addressed solely by his new title.

Very little is known about al-Ikhshid's domestic policies. Nevertheless, the silence of the sources about domestic troubles during his reign—apart from a minor <a href="Shia%20Islam">Shi'ite</a> revolt in 942, which was swiftly suppressed—stands in stark contrast to the usual narrative of Bedouin raids, urban riots over high prices, or military and dynastic revolts and intrigues, and indicates that he was successful in restoring internal tranquillity and orderly government in Egypt. According to the biographical dictionary of <a href="Ibn%20Khallikan">Ibn Khallikan</a>, he was "a resolute prince, displaying great foresight in war, and a close attention to the prosperity of his empire; he treated the military class with honour and governed with ability and justice". His potential rivals Muhammad ibn Takin and al-Madhara'i were quickly won over and incorporated in the new administration. The latter had tried to resist al-Ikhshid's takeover in vain, as his troops had immediately defected, and was initially imprisoned by al-Ikhshid, only to be released in 939. He soon recovered his status and influence, and briefly served as regent of al-Ikhshid's son and heir, <a href="Abu%27l-Qasim%20Unujur%20ibn%20al-Ikhshid">Unujur</a> in 946, before being overthrown and imprisoned for a year. Thereafter, and until his death in 957, he retired into private life. Like the Tulunids before him, al-Ikhshid also took particular care to build up a considerable military force of his own, including Turkic and Black African slave soldiers.

As commander and ruler in Egypt, al-Ikhshid was a patient and cautious man. He achieved his goals as much by diplomacy and ties to powerful personages in the Baghdad regime as by force, and even then he tended to avoid direct military confrontation whenever possible. His conflict with Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh was indicative of his approach: instead of a direct clash, the truce between the two gave al-Ikhshid the time to reconnoitre the situation in Egypt before acting. Although following in the footsteps of Ibn Tulun, his ambitions were more modest and his objectives more practical, as became particularly evident in his policies towards Syria and the rest of the Caliphate. Historically, possession of Syria, and particularly Palestine, was a foreign policy objective for many rulers of Egypt, to foreclose the most likely invasion route into the country. Ibn Tulun before and <a href="Saladin">Saladin</a> after al-Ikhshid were two typical examples of Egyptian rulers who spent much of their reigns securing control of Syria, and indeed used Egypt mostly as a source of revenue and resources to accomplish this goal. Al-Ikhshid differed from them; Bacharach describes him as a "cautious, conservative realist". His goals were limited but clear: his main concern was Egypt proper and the establishment of his family as a hereditary dynasty over it, while Syria remained a secondary objective. Unlike other military strongmen of the time, he had no intention of entering the contest for control of Baghdad and the caliphal government through the all-powerful office of "<a href="amir%20al-umara">amir al-umara</a>"; indeed, when Caliph <a href="al-Mustakfi">al-Mustakfi</a> (r. 944–946) offered him the post, he turned it down.

Following the expulsion of the Fatimids from Egypt, al-Ikhshid had his troops occupy all of Syria up to Aleppo, allying himself, as Ibn Tulun had done, with the local tribe of <a href="Banu%20Kilab">Banu Kilab</a> to strengthen his hold over northern Syria. As governor of Syria, his remit extended to the borderlands ("<a href="thughur">thughur</a>") with the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> in <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>. Thus in 936/7 or 937/8 (most likely in autumn 937) he received an embassy from the Byzantine emperor, <a href="Romanos%20I%20Lekapenos">Romanos I Lekapenos</a> (r. 920–944), to organize a <a href="Arab%E2%80%93Byzantine%20prisoner%20exchanges">prisoner exchange</a>. Although carried out in the name of Caliph al-Radi, it was a special honour and an implicit recognition of al-Ikhshid's autonomy, since correspondence and negotiations for such events were normally directed to the caliph rather than provincial governors. The exchange took place in autumn 938, resulting in the release of 6,300 Muslims for an equivalent number of Byzantine captives. As the Byzantines held 800 more prisoners than the Muslims, these had to be ransomed and were gradually released over the next six months.

While the "amir al-umara" <a href="Muhammad%20ibn%20Ra%27iq">Ibn Ra'iq</a> was in power in Baghdad (936–938) with al-Ikhshid's old friend al-Fadl ibn Ja'far ibn al-Furat as vizier, relations with Baghdad were good. Following Ibn Ra'iq's replacement by the Turk <a href="Bajkam">Bajkam</a>, however, Ibn Ra'iq received a nomination by the caliph to the governorship of Syria and in 939 marched west to claim it from al-Ikhshid's forces. Ibn Ra'iq's appointment enraged al-Ikhshid, who sent an envoy to Baghdad to clarify the situation. There Bajkam informed him that the caliph might appoint whomever he chose, but that it ultimately did not matter: it was military strength that would determine who was governor of Syria and even of Egypt, not any appointment by a figurehead caliph. If either Ibn Ra'iq or al-Ikhshid emerged victorious from the conflict, caliphal confirmation would soon follow. Al-Ikhshid was even more infuriated by the reply, and reportedly for a time even threatened to give one of his daughters to the Fatimid caliph al-Qa'im and to have coins minted and the <a href="Friday%20prayer">Friday prayer</a> read in his name rather than the Abbasid caliph, until the Abbasids formally reconfirmed his position. The Fatimids themselves were preoccupied with the revolt of <a href="Abu%20Yazid">Abu Yazid</a> and were unable to offer any assistance.

From <a href="Raqqa">Raqqa</a>, Ibn Ra'iq's troops swiftly took over the districts of northern Syria, where al-Ikhshid's brother Ubayd Allah was governor, while the Egyptian forces retreated south. By October or November, Ibn Ra'iq's men had reached Ramla and moved on into the <a href="Sinai%20Peninsula">Sinai</a>. Al-Ikhshid led his army against Ibn Ra'iq, but after a short clash at <a href="Pelusium">al-Farama</a>, the two men came to an understanding, dividing Syria between them: the areas from Ramla to the south would be under al-Ikhshid, and the areas to the north under Ibn Ra'iq. In May or June 940, however, al-Ikhshid learned that Ibn Ra'iq had once again moved against Ramla. Once more, the Egyptian ruler led his army to battle. Although defeated at <a href="al-Arish">al-Arish</a>, al-Ikhshid was able to quickly rally his troops and ambush Ibn Ra'iq, preventing him from entering Egypt proper and forcing him to retreat back to Damascus. Al-Ikhshid sent his brother, Abu Nasr al-Husayn, with another army against Ibn Ra'iq, but he was defeated and killed at <a href="Lajjun">Lajjun</a>. Despite his victory, Ibn Ra'iq opted for peace: he gave Abu Nasr an honourable burial and sent his son, Muzahim, as envoy to Egypt. True to his political strategy, al-Ikhshid accepted. The agreement saw the restoration of the territorial status quo of the previous year, but with al-Ikhshid paying an annual tribute of 140,000 gold "<a href="gold%20dinar">dinars</a>". The deal was cemented by the marriage of Muzahim with al-Ikhshid's daughter Fatima.

Peace did not last for long, as the political turmoil in Baghdad continued. In September 941, Ibn Ra'iq assumed once more the post of "amir al-umara" at the invitation of Caliph <a href="al-Muttaqi">al-Muttaqi</a> (r. 940–944), but he was not as powerful as before. Unable to stop the advance of another strongman, <a href="Abu%27l-Husayn%20al-Baridi">Abu'l-Husayn al-Baridi</a> of <a href="Basra">Basra</a>, both Ibn Ra'iq and the caliph were forced to abandon Baghdad and seek the help of the <a href="Hamdanid%20dynasty">Hamdanid</a> ruler of <a href="Mosul">Mosul</a>. The latter soon had Ibn Ra'iq assassinated (April 942) and succeeded him as "amir al-umara" with the "laqab" of <a href="Nasir%20al-Dawla">Nasir al-Dawla</a>. Al-Ikhshid used the opportunity to reoccupy Syria for himself, joining his forces in person in June 942, and venturing as far as Damascus, before returning to Egypt in January 943. The Hamdanids also staked claim on Syria at the same time, but the sources do not record details of their expeditions there. Nasir al-Dawla's position as "amir al-umara" also proved to be weak, and in June 943 he was ousted by the Turkish general <a href="Tuzun%20%28amir%20al-umara%29">Tuzun</a>. In October, Caliph al-Muttaqi, fearing that Tuzun intended to replace him, fled the capital and sought refuge with the Hamdanids. Although Nasir al-Dawla and his brother <a href="Sayf%20al-Dawla">Sayf al-Dawla</a> sheltered the caliph, they also did not confront Tuzun's troops, and in May 944 they reached an agreement that gave Upper Mesopotamia and northern Syria to the Hamdanids in exchange for recognizing Tuzun's possession of Iraq. Nasir al-Dawla sent his cousin <a href="al-Husayn%20ibn%20Sa%27id">al-Husayn ibn Sa'id</a> to take over the Syrian provinces allotted to him in this agreement. The Ikhshidid forces either defected or retreated, and al-Husayn swiftly took over the districts of Qinnasrin and <a href="Jund%20Hims">Hims</a>.

In the meantime, al-Muttaqi with Sayf al-Dawla had fled to Raqqa before Tuzun's advance, but the caliph grew increasingly suspicious of the Hamdanids, and wrote to al-Ikhshid (perhaps as early as the winter of 943), asking for aid. The latter immediately responded by leading an army into Syria. The Hamdanid garrisons withdrew before him, and in September 944, al-Ikhshid reached Raqqa. Distrusting the Hamdanids given their treatment of Ibn Ra'iq, he waited until Sayf al-Dawla had left the city before entering it to meet the caliph. Al-Ikhshid tried without success to persuade al-Muttaqi to come with him to Egypt, or at least to stay in Raqqa, while the caliph tried to get al-Ikhshid to march against Tuzun, which the latter refused. The meeting was not entirely fruitless, as al-Ikhshid secured an agreement that virtually repeated the terms of a similar treaty between the Tulunid Khumarawayh and Caliph <a href="al-Mu%27tamid">al-Mu'tamid</a> in 886. The caliph recognized the authority of al-Ikhshid over Egypt, Syria (with the "thughur"), and the <a href="Hejaz">Hejaz</a> (carrying with it the prestigious guardianship of the <a href="Haram%20%28site%29">two holy cities</a> of <a href="Mecca">Mecca</a> and <a href="Medina">Medina</a>), for a period of thirty years, with the right of hereditary succession for al-Ikhshid's sons. This development had already been anticipated by al-Ikhshid the previous year, when he named his son Unujur as his regent during his absences from Egypt, although Unujur had not yet come of age, and had required an oath of allegiance ("<a href="bay%27a">bay'a</a>") to be sworn to him. Nevertheless, as Michael Brett comments, the territories conferred were "mixed blessings", as the holy cities were exposed to Qarmatian raids, while the marches of the "thughur" were increasingly menaced by the Byzantines, and Aleppo (with northern Syria) was coveted by the Hamdanids.

As it happened, al-Muttaqi was persuaded by the emissaries of Tuzun, who protested his loyalty, to return to Iraq, only to be seized, blinded and deposed on 12 October and replaced by al-Mustakfi. Al-Mustakfi reconfirmed al-Ikhshid's governorship, but by this point it was an empty gesture. According to J. L. Bacharach, although the 13th-century historian <a href="Ibn%20Sa%27id%20al-Maghribi">Ibn Sa'id al-Maghribi</a> reports that al-Ikhshid immediately took the "bay'a" and read the Friday prayer in the new caliph's name, based on the available numismatic evidence, he appears to have delayed recognition of both al-Mustakfi and his <a href="Buyid%20dynasty">Buyid</a>-installed successor <a href="al-Muti">al-Muti</a> (r. 946–974) for several months by refraining from including them in his coinage, in an act that was a deliberate and clear statement of his "de facto" independence from Baghdad. This independence was also acknowledged by others; the contemporary "<a href="De%20Ceremoniis">De Ceremoniis</a>" records that in the correspondence of the Byzantine court, the "Emir of Egypt" was accorded a golden seal worth four "<a href="solidus%20%28coin%29">solidi</a>", the same as the caliph in Baghdad.
Following his meeting with al-Muttaqi, al-Ikhshid returned to Egypt, leaving the field open for the ambitious Sayf al-Dawla. The Ikhshidid forces left behind in Syria were relatively weak, and the Hamdanid leader, having gained the support of the Banu Kilab, had little difficulty in capturing Aleppo on 29 October 944. He then began extending his control over the provinces of northern Syria down to Hims. Al-Ikhshid sent an army under the eunuchs <a href="Abu%20al-Misk%20Kafur">Abu al-Misk Kafur</a> and Fatik against the Hamdanid, but it was defeated near <a href="Hama">Hama</a> and retreated back to Egypt, abandoning Damascus and Palestine to the Hamdanids. Al-Ikhshid was then forced to once again campaign in person in April 945, but at the same time he sent envoys proposing to Sayf al-Dawla an agreement along the lines of the one with Ibn Ra'iq: the Hamdanid prince would get to keep northern Syria, while al-Ikhshid would pay him an annual tribute for the possession of Palestine and Damascus. Sayf al-Dawla refused and reportedly even boasted that he would conquer Egypt itself, but al-Ikhshid held the upper hand: his agents managed to bribe several Hamdanid leaders, and he won over the citizens of Damascus, who barred their gates before the Hamdanid and opened them for al-Ikhshid. The two armies met near Qinnasrin in May, where the Hamdanids were defeated. Sayf al-Dawla fled to Raqqa, leaving his capital Aleppo to be captured by al-Ikhshid.

Nevertheless, in October the two sides came to an agreement, broadly on the lines of the earlier Ikhshidid proposal: al-Ikhshid acknowledged Hamdanid control over northern Syria and even consented to sending an annual tribute in exchange for Sayf al-Dawla's renunciation of all claims on Damascus. The Hamdanid ruler was also to marry one of al-Ikhshid's daughters or nieces. For al-Ikhshid, the maintenance of Aleppo was less important than southern Syria with Damascus, which was Egypt's eastern bulwark. Provided that these remained under his control, he was more than willing to allow the existence of a Hamdanid state in the north. The Egyptian ruler knew that he would have difficulty in asserting and maintaining control over northern Syria and Cilicia, which had traditionally been influenced more by Upper Mesopotamia and Iraq. By abandoning its claims on these distant provinces, not only would Egypt be spared the cost of maintaining a large army there, but the Hamdanid emirate would also fulfil the useful role of a <a href="buffer%20state">buffer state</a> against incursions from both Iraq and a resurgent Byzantine Empire. Indeed, throughout al-Ikhshid's rule, and that of his successors, relations with the Byzantines were quite friendly, as the lack of a common border and the common hostility to the Fatimids guaranteed that the interests of the two states did not clash. Despite Sayf al-Dawla's attempt to push again into southern Syria soon after al-Ikhshid's death, the border agreed in 945 held, and even outlived both dynasties, forming the dividing line between Mesopotamian-influenced northern Syria and the Egyptian-controlled southern part of the country until the <a href="Mamluks%20of%20Egypt">Mamluks</a> seized the entire region in 1260.

In mid-spring 946, al-Ikhshid sent emissaries to the Byzantines for yet another prisoner exchange (which eventually would take place under Sayf al-Dawla's auspices in October). Emperor <a href="Constantine%20VII">Constantine VII</a> (r. 913–959) sent an embassy under <a href="John%20Mystikos">John Mystikos</a> in response, which arrived at Damascus on 11 July. On 24 July 946, al-Ikhshid died in Damascus. The succession of his son Unujur was peaceful and undisputed, due to the influence of the powerful and talented commander-in-chief, Kafur. One of the many Black African slaves recruited by al-Ikhshid, Kafur remained the paramount minister and virtual ruler of Egypt over the next 22 years, assuming power in his own right in 966 until his death two years later. Encouraged by his death, in 969 the Fatimids invaded and conquered Egypt, beginning a new era in the country's history.

Medieval historians noted the many parallels between al-Ikhshid and his Tulunid predecessors, especially Khumarawayh. Ibn Sa'id even reported that according to <a href="Astrology%20in%20medieval%20Islam">Egyptian astrologers</a>, the two men had entered Egypt on the same day of the year and with the same star in the same <a href="ascendant">ascendant</a>. There were important differences, however: al-Ikhshid lacked the "flamboyance" (Hugh Kennedy) of the Tulunids. Al-Ikhshid's caution and self-imposed restraint in his foreign policy objectives also stood in stark contrast with his contemporaries and other rulers of Egypt who preceded and followed him, earning him a reputation of extreme caution, often misinterpreted as timidity by contemporaries. He was also described as less cultivated than his predecessor Ibn Tulun. Unlike Ibn Tulun, who built an entire new capital at <a href="al-Qatta%27i">al-Qatta'i</a> and a <a href="Mosque%20of%20Ibn%20Tulun">famous mosque</a>, al-Ikhshid was neither a patron of artists and poets nor a major builder. According to historian <a href="Thierry%20Bianquis">Thierry Bianquis</a>, he was described by medieval chroniclers as "a choleric and gluttonous man, yet shrewd and inclined toward avarice", but with a fondness for luxuries imported from the east, and especially perfumes. His love of eastern luxuries soon spread among the upper classes of Fustat as well and influenced the style and fashion of local Egyptian products in turn, which began to imitate them.

Acacia pycnantha

Acacia pycnantha, most commonly known as the golden wattle, is a tree of the family <a href="Fabaceae">Fabaceae</a> native to southeastern Australia. It grows to a height of and has <a href="phyllode">phyllode</a>s (flattened leaf stalks) instead of true leaves. <a href="Sickle">Sickle</a>-shaped, these are between long, and wide. The profuse fragrant, golden flowers appear in late winter and spring, followed by long seed pods. Plants are cross-pollinated by several species of <a href="honeyeater">honeyeater</a> and <a href="Acanthiza">thornbill</a>, which visit <a href="Nectar%23Extrafloral%20nectaries">nectaries</a> on the phyllodes and brush against flowers, transferring pollen between them. An <a href="understorey">understorey</a> plant in <a href="eucalyptus">eucalyptus</a> forest, it is found from southern New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, through Victoria and into southeastern South Australia.

Explorer <a href="Thomas%20Mitchell%20%28explorer%29">Thomas Mitchell</a> collected the <a href="type%20specimen">type specimen</a>, from which <a href="George%20Bentham">George Bentham</a> wrote the <a href="species%20description">species description</a> in 1842. No subspecies are recognised. The bark of "A. pycnantha" produces more <a href="tannin">tannin</a> than any other wattle species, resulting in its commercial cultivation for production of this compound. It has been widely grown as an ornamental garden plant and for cut flower production, but has become a weed in South Africa, Tanzania, Italy, Portugal, Sardinia, India, Indonesia, New Zealand, as well as Western Australia, Tasmania and New South Wales. "Acacia pycnantha" was made the official <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20floral%20emblems">floral emblem of Australia</a> in 1988, and has been featured on the country's postal stamps.

"Acacia pycnantha" generally grows as a small tree to between in height, though trees of up to high have been reported in Morocco. The bark is generally dark brown to grey—smooth in younger plants though it can be furrowed and rough in older plants. Branchlets may be bare and smooth or <a href="pruinescence">covered with a white bloom</a>. The mature trees do not have <a href="Leaf">true leaves</a> but have <a href="Petiole%20%28botany%29%23Description">phyllodes</a>—flat and widened leaf stems—that hang down from the branches. Shiny and dark green, these are between long, wide and falcate (<a href="sickle">sickle</a>-shaped) to <a href="wikt%3Aoblanceolate">oblanceolate</a> in shape. New growth has a bronze colouration. Field observations at <a href="Hale%20Conservation%20Park">Hale Conservation Park</a> show the bulk of new growth to take place over spring and summer from October to January.

Floral buds are produced year-round on the tips of new growth, but only those initiated between November and May go on to flower several months later. Flowering usually takes place from July to November (late winter to early summer) in the golden wattle's native range; because the later buds develop faster, flowering peaks over July and August. The bright yellow <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s occur in groups of 40 to 80 on -long <a href="raceme">raceme</a>s that arise from <a href="axillary%20bud">axillary bud</a>s. Each inflorescence is a ball-like structure that is covered by 40 to 100 small flowers that have five tiny petals (<a href="merosity">pentamerous</a>) and long erect <a href="stamen">stamen</a>s, which give the flower head a fluffy appearance.

Developing after flowering has finished, the seed pods are flattish, straight or slightly curved, long and 5–8 mm wide. They are initially bright green, maturing to dark brown and have slight constrictions between the seeds, which are arranged in a line in the pod. The oblong seeds themselves are 5.5 to 6 mm long, black and shiny, with a <a href="wikt%3Aclavate">clavate</a> (club-shaped) <a href="aril">aril</a>. They are released in December and January, when the pods are fully ripe.

Species similar in appearance include mountain hickory wattle ("<a href="Acacia%20obliquinervia">A. obliquinervia</a>"), coast golden wattle ("<a href="Acacia%20leiophylla">A. leiophylla</a>") and golden wreath wattle ("<a href="Acacia%20saligna">A. saligna</a>"). "Acacia obliquinervia" has grey-green phyllodes, fewer flowers in its flower heads, and broader (-wide) seed pods. "A. leiophylla" has paler phyllodes. "A. saligna" has longer, narrower phyllodes.

"Acacia pycnantha" was first formally <a href="species%20description">described</a> by botanist <a href="George%20Bentham">George Bentham</a> in the "<a href="London%20Journal%20of%20Botany">London Journal of Botany</a>" in 1842. The <a href="type%20specimen">type specimen</a> was collected by the explorer <a href="Thomas%20Mitchell%20%28explorer%29">Thomas Mitchell</a> in present-day northern <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> between <a href="Pyramid%20Hill">Pyramid Hill</a> and the <a href="Loddon%20River">Loddon River</a>. Bentham thought it was related to "A. leiophylla", which he described in the same paper. The specific epithet "pycnantha" is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> words "pyknos" (dense) and "anthos" (flowers), a reference to the dense cluster of flowers that make up the globular inflorescences. Queensland botanist <a href="Leslie%20Pedley">Les Pedley</a> reclassified the species as "Racosperma pycnanthum" in 2003, when he proposed placing almost all Australian members of the genus into the new genus "<a href="Racosperma">Racosperma</a>". However, this name is treated as a <a href="Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonym</a> of its original name.

<a href="Johann%20Georg%20Christian%20Lehmann">Johann Georg Christian Lehmann</a> described "Acacia petiolaris" in 1851 from a plant grown at Hamburg Botanic Gardens from seed said to be from the <a href="Swan%20River%20Colony">Swan River Colony</a> (Perth). <a href="Carl%20Meissner">Carl Meissner</a> described "A. falcinella" from material from Port Lincoln in 1855. Bentham classified both as "A. pycnantha" in his 1864 "<a href="Flora%20Australiensis">Flora Australiensis</a>", though he did categorise a possible subspecies "angustifolia" based on material from <a href="Spencer%20Gulf">Spencer Gulf</a> with narrower phyllodes and fewer inflorescences. However, no subspecies are currently recognised, though an informal classification distinguishes wetland and dryland forms, the latter with narrower phyllodes.

In 1921 <a href="Joseph%20Maiden">Joseph Maiden</a> described "Acacia westonii" from the northern and western slopes of Mount Jerrabomberra near <a href="Queanbeyan">Queanbeyan</a> in <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>. He felt it was similar to, but distinct from, "A. pycnantha" and was uncertain whether it warranted species rank. His colleague <a href="Richard%20Hind%20Cambage">Richard Hind Cambage</a> grew seedlings and reported they had much longer <a href="Plant%20stem">internodes</a> than those of "A. pycnantha", and that the phyllodes appeared to have three <a href="Nectar%23Extrafloral%20nectaries">nectaries</a> rather than the single one of the latter species. It is now regarded as a synonym of "A. pycnantha".

Common names recorded include golden wattle, green wattle, black wattle, and broad-leaved wattle. At <a href="Ebenezer%20Mission">Ebenezer Mission</a> in the <a href="Wergaia">Wergaia</a> country of north-western Victoria the aborigines referred to it as "witch".

Hybrids of the species are known in nature and cultivation. In the <a href="Greater%20Bendigo%20National%20Park">Whipstick forest</a> near <a href="Bendigo">Bendigo</a> in Victoria, putative hybrids with Whirrakee wattle ("<a href="Acacia%20williamsonii">Acacia williamsonii</a>") have been identified; these resemble hakea wattle ("<a href="Acacia%20hakeoides">Acacia hakeoides</a>"). Garden hybrids with Queensland silver wattle ("<a href="Acacia%20podalyriifolia">Acacia podalyriifolia</a>") raised in Europe have been given the names "Acacia x siebertiana" and "Acacia x deneufvillei".

Golden wattle occurs in south-eastern Australia from <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>'s southern <a href="Eyre%20Peninsula">Eyre Peninsula</a> and <a href="Flinders%20Ranges">Flinders Ranges</a> across Victoria and northwards into inland areas of southern New South Wales and the <a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Australian Capital Territory</a>. It is found in the <a href="understory">understorey</a> of open <a href="eucalypt">eucalypt</a> forests on dry, shallow soils.

The species has become <a href="Naturalisation%20%28biology%29">naturalised</a> beyond its original range in Australia. In New South Wales it is especially prevalent around Sydney and the <a href="Central%20Coast%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Central Coast region</a>. In Tasmania it has spread in the east of the state and become <a href="weed">weed</a>y in bushland near <a href="Hobart">Hobart</a>. In Western Australia, it is found in the <a href="Darling%20Scarp">Darling Range</a> and western <a href="Wheatbelt%20%28Western%20Australia%29">wheatbelt</a> as well as <a href="Esperance%2C%20Western%20Australia">Esperance</a> and <a href="Kalgoorlie">Kalgoorlie</a>.

Outside Australia it has become naturalised in South Africa, Tanzania, Italy, Portugal, Sardinia, India, Indonesia and New Zealand. It is present in California as a garden escapee, but is not considered to be naturalised there. In South Africa, where it had been introduced between 1858 and 1865 for dune stabilization and <a href="tannin">tannin</a> production, it had spread along waterways into forest, mountain and lowland <a href="fynbos">fynbos</a>, and borderline areas between fynbos and <a href="karoo">karoo</a>. The gall-forming wasp "<a href="Trichilogaster%20signiventris">Trichilogaster signiventris</a>" has been introduced in South Africa for <a href="biological%20control">biological control</a> and has reduced the capacity of trees to reproduce throughout their range. The eggs are laid by adult wasps into buds of flower heads in the summer, before hatching in May and June when the larvae induce the formation of the grape-like galls and prevent flower development. The galls can be so heavy that branches break under their weight. In addition, the introduction in 2001 of the acacia seed weevil "<a href="Melanterius%20compactus">Melanterius compactus</a>" has also proved effective.

Though plants are usually killed by a severe fire, mature specimens are able to <a href="resprouter">resprout</a>. Seeds are able to persist in the soil for more than five years, germinating after fire.

Like other wattles, "Acacia pycnantha" <a href="nitrogen%20fixation">fixes nitrogen</a> from the atmosphere. It hosts bacteria known as <a href="rhizobia">rhizobia</a> that form root nodules, where they make nitrogen available in organic form and thus help the plant grow in poor soils. A field study across Australia and South Africa found that the microbes are genetically diverse, belonging to various strains of the species "<a href="Bradyrhizobium%20japonicum">Bradyrhizobium japonicum</a>" and genus "<a href="Burkholderia">Burkholderia</a>" in both countries. It is unclear whether the golden wattle was accompanied by the bacteria to the African continent or encountered new populations there.

<a href="Self-incompatibility%20in%20plants">Self-incompatible</a>, "Acacia pycnantha" cannot fertilise itself and requires cross-<a href="pollination">pollination</a> between plants to set seed. Birds facilitate this and field experiments keeping birds away from flowers greatly reduces seed production. Nectaries are located on phyllodes; those near open flowers become active, producing <a href="nectar">nectar</a> that birds feed upon just before or during flowering. While feeding, birds brush against the flower heads and dislodge pollen and often visit multiple trees. Several species of <a href="honeyeater">honeyeater</a>, including the <a href="white-naped%20honeyeater">white-naped</a>, <a href="yellow-faced%20honeyeater">yellow-faced</a>, <a href="New%20Holland%20honeyeater">New Holland</a>, and occasionally <a href="white-plumed%20honeyeater">white-plumed</a> and <a href="crescent%20honeyeater">crescent honeyeater</a>s, and <a href="Eastern%20spinebill">Eastern spinebill</a>s have been observed foraging. Other bird species include the <a href="silvereye">silvereye</a>, <a href="striated%20thornbill">striated</a>, <a href="buff-rumped%20thornbill">buff-rumped</a> and <a href="brown%20thornbill">brown thornbill</a>s. As well as eating nectar, birds often pick off insects on the foliage. Honeybees, native bees, ants and flies also visit nectaries, but generally do not come into contact with the flowers during this activity. The presence of "Acacia pycnantha" is positively correlated with numbers of <a href="swift%20parrot">swift parrot</a>s overwintering in <a href="box%E2%80%93ironbark%20forest">box–ironbark forest</a> in central Victoria, though it is not clear whether the parrots are feeding on them or some other factor is at play.

The wood serves as food for larvae of the <a href="Buprestidae">jewel beetle</a> species "<a href="Agrilus%20assimilis">Agrilus assimilis</a>", "<a href="Agrilus%20australasiae">A. australasiae</a>" and "<a href="Agrilus%20hypoleucus">A. hypoleucus</a>". The larvae of a number of butterfly species feed on the foliage including the <a href="Hypochrysops%20ignita">fiery jewel</a>, <a href="Jalmenus%20icilius">icilius blue</a>, <a href="Jalmenus%20lithochroa">lithocroa blue</a> and <a href="Theclinesthes%20miskini">wattle blue</a>. "<a href="Trichilogaster">Trichilogaster</a>" wasps form galls in the flowerheads, disrupting seed set and
"<a href="Acizzia%20acaciaepycnanthae">Acizzia acaciaepycnanthae</a>", a <a href="Jumping%20plant%20louse">psyllid</a>, sucks sap from the leaves.
"Acacia pycnantha" is a host to rust fungus species in the genus "<a href="Uromycladium">Uromycladium</a>" that affect the phyllodes and branches. These include "<a href="Uromycladium%20simplex">Uromycladium simplex</a>" that forms pustules and "<a href="Uromycladium%20tepperianum">U. tepperianum</a>" that causes large swollen brown to black galls that eventually lead to the death of the host plant. Two fungal species have been isolated from <a href="leaf%20spot">leaf spot</a>s on "Acacia pycnantha": "<a href="Seimatosporium%20arbuti">Seimatosporium arbuti</a>", which is found on a wide range of plant hosts, and "<a href="Monochaetia%20lutea">Monochaetia lutea</a>".

Golden wattle has been grown in temperate regions around the world for the tannin in its bark, as it provides the highest yield of all <a href="Acacias">wattles</a>. Trees can be harvested for tannin from seven to ten years of age. Commercial use of its timber is limited by the small size of trees, but it has high value as a fuel wood. The scented flowers have been used for <a href="perfume">perfume</a> making, and honey production in humid areas. However, the pollen is too dry to be collected by bees in dry climates. In southern Europe, it is one of several species grown for the cut-flower trade and sold as "mimosa". Like many other species of wattle, "Acacia pycnantha" exudes gum when stressed. Eaten by <a href="indigenous%20Australian">indigenous Australian</a>s, the gum has been investigated as a possible alternative to <a href="gum%20arabic">gum arabic</a>, commonly used in the food industry.

Golden wattle is cultivated in Australia and was introduced to the northern hemisphere in the mid-1800s. Although it has a relatively short lifespan of 15 to 30 years, it is widely grown for its bright yellow, fragrant flowers. As well as being an ornamental plant, it has been used as a windbreak or in controlling erosion. Trees are sometimes planted with the taller sugar gum ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20cladocalyx">Eucalyptus cladocalyx</a>") to make a two-layered windbreak. One form widely cultivated was originally collected on <a href="Mount%20Arapiles">Mount Arapiles</a> in western Victoria. It is <a href="floriferous">floriferous</a>, with fragrant flowers appearing from April to July. The species has a degree of frost tolerance and is adaptable to a wide range of soil conditions, but it prefers good drainage. It tolerates heavy soils in dry climates, as well as mild <a href="soil%20salinity">soil salinity</a>. It can suffer yellowing (<a href="chlorosis">chlorosis</a>) in limestone-based (alkaline) soils. Highly drought-tolerant, it needs winter rainfall for cultivation. It is vulnerable to gall attack in cultivation. Propagation is from seed which has been pre-soaked in hot water to soften the hard seed coating.

Although wattles, and in particular the golden wattle, have been the informal floral emblem of Australia for many years (for instance, it represented Australia on the <a href="Coronation%20gown%20of%20Queen%20Elizabeth%20II">Coronation gown of Queen Elizabeth II</a> in 1953), it was not until Australia's bicentenary in 1988 that the golden wattle was formally adopted as the <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20floral%20emblems">floral emblem of Australia</a>. This was proclaimed by Governor-General Sir <a href="Ninian%20Stephen">Ninian Stephen</a> in the <a href="Government%20gazette">Government gazette</a> published on 1 September. The day was marked by a ceremony at the <a href="Australian%20National%20Botanic%20Gardens">Australian National Botanic Gardens</a> which included the planting of a golden wattle by <a href="Hazel%20Hawke">Hazel Hawke</a>, the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister's</a> wife. In 1992, 1 September was formally declared "<a href="Wattle%20Day">National Wattle Day</a>".

The <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Australia">Australian Coat of Arms</a> includes a wreath of wattle; this does not, however, accurately represent a golden wattle. Similarly, the <a href="green%20and%20gold">green and gold</a> colours used by Australian international sporting teams were inspired by the colours of wattles in general, rather than the golden wattle specifically.

The species was depicted on a stamp captioned "wattle" as part of a 1959–60 <a href="Postage%20stamps%20and%20postal%20history%20of%20Australia">Australian stamp</a> set featuring Australian native flowers. In 1970, a 5c stamp labelled "Golden Wattle" was issued to complement an earlier set depicting the floral emblems of Australia. To mark <a href="Australia%20Day">Australia Day</a> in 1990, a 41c stamp labelled "Acacia pycnantha" was issued. Another stamp labelled "Golden Wattle", with a value of 70c, was issued in 2014.

<a href="Clare%20Waight%20Keller">Clare Waight Keller</a> included golden wattles to represent Australia in <a href="Meghan%20Markle">Meghan Markle's</a> <a href="Wedding%20of%20Prince%20Harry%20and%20Meghan%20Markle">wedding</a> veil, which included the distinctive flora of each <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> country.

Paraceratherium

Paraceratherium is an extinct <a href="genus">genus</a> of hornless <a href="Rhinocerotoidea">rhinoceros</a>, and one of the largest terrestrial <a href="mammals">mammals</a> that has ever existed. It lived from the early to late <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> epoch (34–23 million years ago); its remains have been found across <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> between China and the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>. It is classified as a member of the <a href="hyracodont">hyracodont</a> subfamily <a href="Indricotheriinae">Indricotheriinae</a>. "Paraceratherium" means "near the hornless beast", in reference to "<a href="Aceratherium">Aceratherium</a>", the genus in which the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> "P. bugtiense" was originally placed.

The exact size of "Paraceratherium" is unknown because of the incompleteness of the fossils. Its weight is estimated to have been at most; the shoulder height was about , and the length about . The legs were long and pillar-like. The long neck supported a skull that was about long. It had large, tusk-like <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s and a nasal incision that suggests it had a <a href="prehensile">prehensile</a> upper lip or <a href="proboscis">proboscis</a> (trunk). The lifestyle of "Paraceratherium" may have been similar to that of modern large mammals such as the <a href="elephant">elephant</a>s and extant rhinoceroses. Because of its size, it would have had few predators and a slow rate of reproduction. It was a <a href="browsing%20%28herbivory%29">browser</a>, eating mainly leaves, soft plants, and shrubs. It lived in habitats ranging from arid deserts with a few scattered trees to subtropical forests. The reasons for the animal's extinction are unknown, but various factors have been proposed.

The <a href="taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a> of the genus and the species within has a long and complicated history. Other genera of Oligocene indricotheres, such as Baluchitherium, Indricotherium, and Pristinotherium, have been named, but no complete specimens exist, making comparison and classification difficult. Most modern scientists consider these genera to be <a href="junior%20synonym">junior synonym</a>s of "Paraceratherium", and it is thought to contain at least three discernible species; "P. bugtiense", "P. transouralicum", and "P. huangheense". The most completely-known species is "P. transouralicum", so most reconstructions of the genus are based on it. Differences between "P. bugtiense" and "P. transouralicum" may be due to <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>, which would make them the same species.

The <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> history of "Paraceratherium" is complex due to the fragmentary nature of the known fossils and because western, <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a>, and Chinese scientists worked in isolation from each other for much of the 20th century and published research mainly in their respective languages. Scientists from different parts of the world did attempt to compare their finds to get a more complete picture of these animals, but were hindered by politics and wars. The opposing taxonomic tendencies of "<a href="lumping%20and%20splitting">lumping and splitting</a>" have also contributed to the problem. Inaccurate <a href="geological%20dating">geological dating</a> previously led scientists to believe various <a href="geological%20formation">geological formation</a>s that are now known to be contemporaneous were of different ages. Many genera were named on the basis of subtle differences in <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molar</a> tooth characteristicsfeatures that vary within populations of other rhinoceros <a href="taxa">taxa</a>and are therefore not accepted by most scientists for distinguishing species.

Early discoveries of <a href="indricotheres">indricotheres</a> were made through various colonial links to Asia. The first known indricothere fossils were collected from <a href="Balochistan">Balochistan</a> (in modern-day Pakistan) in 1846 by a soldier named Vickary, but these fragments were unidentifiable at the time. The first fossils now recognised as "Paraceratherium" were discovered by the British geologist <a href="Guy%20Ellcock%20Pilgrim">Guy Ellcock Pilgrim</a> in Balochistan in 1907–1908. His material consisted of an upper jaw, lower teeth, and the back of a jaw. The fossils were collected in the <a href="Chitarwata%20Formation">Chitarwata Formation</a> of <a href="Dera%20Bugti">Dera Bugti</a>, where Pilgrim had previously been exploring. In 1908, he used the fossils as basis for a new species of the extinct rhinoceros genus "<a href="Aceratherium">Aceratherium</a>"; "A. bugtiense". "Aceratherium" was by then a <a href="wastebasket%20taxon">wastebasket taxon</a>; it included several unrelated species of hornless rhinoceros, many of which have since been moved to other genera. Fossil <a href="incisors">incisors</a> that Pilgrim had previously assigned to the unrelated genus "<a href="Bugtitherium">Bugtitherium</a>" were later shown to belong to the new species.

In 1910, more partial fossils were discovered in Dera Bugti during an expedition by the British palaeontologist <a href="Clive%20Forster-Cooper">Clive Forster-Cooper</a>. Based on these remains, Foster-Cooper moved "A. bugtiense" to the new genus "Paraceratherium", meaning "near the hornless beast", in reference to "Aceratherium". His rationale for this reclassification was the species' distinctly down-turned lower tusks. In 1913, Forster-Cooper named a new genus and species, "Thaumastotherium" ("wonderful beast") "osborni", based on larger fossils from the same excavations, but he renamed the genus "Baluchitherium" later that year because the former name was <a href="Preoccupied%20name">preoccupied</a>, as it had already been used for a <a href="hemipteran">hemipteran</a> insect. The fossils of "Baluchitherium" were so fragmentary that Foster-Cooper was only able to identify it as a kind of <a href="odd-toed%20ungulate">odd-toed ungulate</a>, but he mentioned the possibility of confusion with "Paraceratherium". The American palaeontologist <a href="Henry%20Fairfield%20Osborn">Henry Fairfield Osborn</a>, after which "B. osborni" was named, suggested it may have been a <a href="titanothere">titanothere</a>.

A <a href="Russian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Russian Academy of Sciences</a> expedition later found fossils in the <a href="Aral%20Formation">Aral Formation</a> near the <a href="Aral%20Sea">Aral Sea</a> in Kazakhstan; it was the most complete indricothere skeleton known, but it lacked the skull. In 1916, based on these remains, Aleksei Alekseeivich Borissiak erected the genus "Indricotherium" named for a mythological monster, the "<a href="Indrik%20beast">Indrik beast</a>". He did not assign a species name, "I. asiaticum", until 1923, but the Russian palaeontologist <a href="Maria%20Pavlova">Maria Pavlova</a> had already named it "I. transouralicum" in 1922. Also in 1923, Borissiak created the subfamily Indricotheriinae to include the various related forms known by then. 

In 1922, the American explorer <a href="Roy%20Chapman%20Andrews">Roy Chapman Andrews</a> led a well documented expedition to China and <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a> sponsored by the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a>. Various indricothere remains were found in formations of the Mongolian <a href="Gobi%20Desert">Gobi Desert</a>, including the legs of a specimen standing in an upright position, indicating that it had died while trapped in <a href="quicksand">quicksand</a>, as well as a very complete skull. These remains became the basis of "Baluchitherium grangeri", named by Osborn in 1923.

In 2017, a new species, "P. huangheense", was named by the Chinese palaeontologist Yong-Xiang Li and colleagues based on jaw elements from the Hanjiajing Formation in the <a href="Gansu%20Province">Gansu Province</a> of China; the name refers to the nearby <a href="Huanghe%20River">Huanghe River</a>. A multitude of other species and genus namesmostly based on differences in size, snout shape, and front tooth arrangementhave been coined for various indricothere remains. Fossils attributable to "Paraceratherium" continue to be discovered across Eurasia, but the political situation in Pakistan has become too unstable for further excavations to occur there.

In 1922 Forster-Cooper named the new species "<a href="Metamynodon">Metamynodon</a> bugtiensis" based on a palate and other fragments from Dera Bugti, thought to belong to a giant member of that genus. These fossils are now thought to have belonged to an aberrant "Paraceratherium bugtiense" specimen that lacked the M3 molar. In 1936, the American palaeontologists <a href="Walter%20W.%20Granger">Walter Granger</a> and <a href="William%20K.%20Gregory">William K. Gregory</a> proposed that Forster-Cooper's "Baluchitherium osborni" was likely a <a href="junior%20synonym">junior synonym</a> (an invalid name for the same taxon) of "Paraceratherium bugtiense", because these specimens were collected at the same locality and were possibly part of the same <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphologically</a> variable species. The American palaeontologist <a href="William%20Diller%20Matthew">William Diller Matthew</a> and Forster-Cooper himself had expressed similar doubts few years earlier. Although it had already been declared a junior synonym, the genus name "Baluchitherium" remained popular in various media because of the publicity surrounding Osborn's "B. grangeri".

In 1989, the American palaeontologists <a href="Spencer%20G.%20Lucas">Spencer G. Lucas</a> and Jay C. Sobus published a revision of indricothere taxa, which is followed by most western scientists today. They concluded that "Paraceratherium", as the oldest name, was the only valid indricothere genus from the Oligocene, and contained four valid species, "P. bugtiense", "P. transouralicum" (originally in "Indricotherium"), "P. prohorovi" (originally in "<a href="Aralotherium">Aralotherium</a>"), and "P. orgosensis" (originally in "<a href="Dzungariotherium">Dzungariotherium</a>"). They considered most other names to be junior synonyms of those taxa, or as <a href="dubious%20names">dubious names</a>, based on remains too fragmentary to identify properly. By analysing alleged differences between named genera and species, Lucas and Sobus found that these most likely represented variation within populations, and that most features were indistinguishable between specimens, as had been pointed out in the 1930s. The fact that the single skull assigned to "P. transouralicum" or "Indricotherium" was domed, while others were flat at the top was attributed to <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>. Therefore, it is possible that "P. bugtiense" fossils represent the female, while "P. transouralicum" represents the male of the same species.

According to Lucas and Sobus, the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> "P. bugtiense" from the late Oligocene of Pakistan includes junior synonyms such as "B. osborni" and "P. zhajremensis". "P. transouralicum" from the late Oligocene of Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and northern China includes "B. grangeri" and "I. minus". In 2013, the American palaeontologist <a href="Donald%20Prothero">Donald Prothero</a> suggested that "P. orgosensis" may be distinct enough to warrant its original genus name "Dzungariotherium", though its exact position requires evaluation. "P. prohorovi" from the late Oligocene of Kazakhstan may be too incomplete for its position to be resolved in relation to the other species; the same applies to proposed species such as "I. intermedium" and "P. tienshanensis", as well as the genus "Benaratherium". Though the genus name "Indricotherium" is now a junior synonym of "Paraceratherium", the subfamily name Indricotheriinae is still in use because genus name synonymy does not affect the names of higher level taxa that are derived from these. Members of the subfamily are therefore still commonly referred to as indricotheres.

In contrast to the revision by Lucas and Sobus, a 2003 paper by Chinese researchers suggested that "Indricotherium" and "Dzungariotherium" were valid genera, and that "P. prohorovi" did not belong in "Paraceratherium". They also recognised the validity of species such as "P. lipidus", "P. tienshanensis", and "P. sui". A 2004 paper by Chinese palaeontologist <a href="Tao%20Deng">Tao Deng</a> and colleagues also recognised three distinct genera. Some western writers have similarly used names otherwise considered invalid since the 1989 revision, but without providing detailed analysis and justification.

The <a href="Taxonomic%20rank">superfamily</a> <a href="Rhinocerotoidea">Rhinocerotoidea</a>, which includes modern rhinoceroses, can be traced back to the <a href="early%20Eocene">early Eocene</a>about 50 million years agowith early precursors such as "<a href="Hyrachyus">Hyrachyus</a>". Rhinocerotoidea contains three families; <a href="Amynodontidae">Amynodontidae</a>, <a href="Rhinocerotidae">Rhinocerotidae</a> ("true rhinoceroses"), and <a href="Hyracodontidae">Hyracodontidae</a>. The diversity within the rhinoceros group was much larger in prehistoric times; they ranged from dog-sized to the size of "Paraceratherium". There were long-legged, <a href="cursorial">cursorial</a> forms adapted for running and squat, <a href="semi%20aquatic">semi aquatic</a> forms. Most species did not have horns. Rhinoceros fossils are identified as such mainly by characteristics of their teeth, which is the part of the animals most likely to be preserved. The upper molars of most rhinoceroses have a <a href="Pi%20%28letter%29">pi</a>-shaped (π) pattern on the crown, and each lower molar has paired L-shapes. Various skull features are also used for identification of fossil rhinoceroses.

The subfamily Indricotheriinae, to which "Paraceratherium" belongs, was first classified as part of the family Hyracodontidae by the American palaeontologist <a href="Leonard%20B.%20Radinsky">Leonard B. Radinsky</a> in 1966. Previously, they had been regarded as a subfamily within Rhinocerotidea, or even a full family, Indricotheriidae. In a 1999 <a href="cladistic">cladistic</a> study of <a href="tapiromorphs">tapiromorphs</a>, the American palaeontologist Luke Holbrook found indricotheres to be outside the hyracodontid <a href="clade">clade</a>, and wrote that they may not be a <a href="monophyletic">monophyletic</a> (natural) grouping. Radinsky's scheme is the prevalent hypothesis today. The hyracodont family contains long-legged members adapted to running, such as "<a href="Hyracodon">Hyracodon</a>", and were distinguished by incisor characteristics. Indricotheres are distinguished from other hyracodonts by their larger size and the <a href="Synapomorphy">derived</a> structure of their snouts, incisors and canines. The earliest known indricothere is the dog-sized "<a href="Forstercooperia">Forstercooperia</a>" from the middle and late <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> of western North America and Asia. The cow-sized "<a href="Juxia">Juxia</a>" is known from the middle Eocene; by the late Eocene the genus "<a href="Urtinotherium">Urtinotherium</a>" of Asia had almost reached the size of "Paraceratherium". "Paraceratherium" itself lived in Eurasia during the <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> period, 23 to 34 million years ago. The genus is distinguished from other indricotheres by its large size, nasal incision that would have supported a muscular snout, and its down-turned <a href="premaxillae">premaxillae</a>. It had also lost the second and third lower incisors, lower canines, and lower first <a href="premolar">premolar</a>s.

The <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> below follows the 1989 analysis of Indricotheriinae by Lucas and Sobus, and shows the closest relatives of "Paraceratherium":

Lucas and colleagues had reached similar conclusions in a previous 1981 analysis of "Forstercooperia", wherein they still retained "Paraceratherium" and "Indricotherium" as separate genera. In 2016, the Chinese researchers Haibing Wang and colleagues used the name Paraceratheriidae for the family and paraceratheriine for the subfamily, and placed them outside of Hyracodontidae.

"Paraceratherium" is one of the largest known land mammals that have ever existed, but its exact size is unclear because of the lack of complete specimens. Early estimates of are now considered exaggerated; it may have been in the range of at maximum, and as low as on average. Calculations have mainly been based on fossils of "P. transouralicum" because this species is known from the most complete remains. Estimates have been based on skull, teeth, and limb bone measurements, but the known bone elements are represented by individuals of different sizes, so all skeletal reconstructions are composite extrapolations, resulting in several weight ranges. Its total body length was estimated as from front to back by Granger and Gregory in 1936, and by the Soviet palaeontologist <a href="Vera%20Gromova">Vera Gromova</a> in 1959, but the former estimate is now considered exaggerated. The weight of "Paraceratherium" was similar to that of some extinct <a href="proboscidea">proboscidea</a>ns, with the largest complete skeleton known belonging to the <a href="steppe%20mammoth">steppe mammoth</a> ("Mammuthus trogontherii"). Despite its roughly equivalent mass, "Paraceratherium" might have been taller than any proboscidean. Its shoulder height was estimated as at the shoulders by Granger and Gregory, but by the American palaeontologist <a href="Gregory%20S.%20Paul">Gregory S. Paul</a> in 1997. The neck was estimated at long by the palaeontologists <a href="Michael%20P.%20Taylor">Michael P. Taylor</a> and Mathew J. Wedel in 2013. "P. huangheense" differs from "P. bugtiense" only in the anatomy of the rear portion of the jaw, as well as its larger size.

No complete set of <a href="vertebrae">vertebrae</a> and ribs of "Paraceratherium" have yet been found and the tail is completely unknown. The <a href="atlas%20%28anatomy%29">atlas</a> and <a href="axis%20%28anatomy%29">axis</a> vertebrae of the neck are wider than in most modern rhinoceroses, with space for strong ligaments and muscles that would be needed to hold up the large head. The rest of the vertebrae were also very wide, and had large <a href="zygapophyses">zygapophyses</a> with much room for muscles, tendons, ligaments, and nerves, to support the head, neck, and spine. The <a href="neural%20spines">neural spines</a> were long and formed a long "hump" along the back, where neck muscles and nuchal ligaments for holding up the skull were attached. The ribs were similar to those of modern rhinoceroses, but the ribcage would have looked smaller in proportion to the long legs and large bodies, because modern rhinoceroses are comparatively short-limbed. The last vertebra of the lower back was fused to the <a href="sacrum">sacrum</a>, a feature found in advanced rhinoceroses. Like <a href="sauropoda">sauropod dinosaurs</a>, "Paraceratherium" had <a href="pleurocoel">pleurocoel</a>-like openings (hollow parts of the bone) in their pre-sacral vertebrae, which probably helped to lighten the skeleton.

The limbs were large and robust to support the animal's large weight, and were in some ways similar to and <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent</a> with those of elephants and sauropod dinosaurs with their likewise graviportal (heavy and slow moving) builds. Unlike such animals, which tend to lengthen the upper limb bones while shortening, fusing and compressing the lower limb, hand, and foot bones, "Paraceratherium" had short upper limb bones and long hand and foot bonesexcept for the disc-shaped <a href="phalanges">phalanges</a>similar to the running rhinoceroses from which they descended. Some foot bones were almost long. The thigh bones typically measured , a size only exceeded by those of some elephants and dinosaurs. The thigh bones were pillar-like and much thicker and more robust than those of other rhinoceroses, and the three <a href="trochanters">trochanters</a> on the sides were much reduced, as this robustness diminished their importance. The limbs were held in a column-like posture instead of bent, as in smaller animals, which reduced the need for large limb muscles. The front limbs had three toes.

Due to the fragmentary nature of known "Paraceratherium" fossils, the animal has been reconstructed in several different ways since its discovery. In 1923, Matthew supervised an artist to draw a reconstruction of the skeleton based on the even less complete "P. transouralicum" specimens known by then, using the proportions of a modern rhinoceros as a guide. The result was too squat and compact, and Osborn had a more slender version drawn later the same year. Some later life restorations have made the animal too slender, with little regard to the underlying skeleton. Gromova published a more complete skeletal reconstruction in 1959, based on the "P. transouralicum" skeleton from the Aral Formation, but this also lacked several neck vertebrae.

There are no indications of the colour and skin texture of the animal because no skin impressions or mummies are known. Most life restorations show the creature's skin as thick, folded, grey, and hairless, based on modern rhinoceroses. Because hair retains body heat, modern large mammals such as elephants and rhinoceroses are largely hairless. Prothero has proposed that, contrary to most depictions, "Paraceratherium" had large elephant-like ears that it used for <a href="thermoregulation">thermoregulation</a>. The ears of elephants enlarge the body's surface area and are filled with blood vessels, making the dissipation of excess heat easier. According to Prothero, this would have been true for "Paraceratherium"; he points to robust bones around the ear openings. The palaeontologists Pierre-Olivier Antoine and <a href="Darren%20Naish">Darren Naish</a> have expressed scepticism towards this idea.

The largest skulls of "Paraceratherium" are around long, at the back of the skull, and wide across by the <a href="zygomatic%20arches">zygomatic arches</a>. "Paraceratherium" had a long forehead, which was smooth and lacked the roughened area that serves as attachment point for the horns of other rhinoceroses. The bones above the nasal region are long and the nasal incision goes far into the skull. This indicates that "Paraceratherium" had a <a href="prehensile">prehensile</a> upper lip similar to that of the <a href="black%20rhinoceros">black rhinoceros</a> and the <a href="Indian%20rhinoceros">Indian rhinoceros</a>, or a short <a href="proboscis">proboscis</a> (trunk) as in <a href="tapir">tapir</a>s. The back of the skull was low and narrow, without the large <a href="lambdoid">lambdoid</a> crests at the top and along the <a href="sagittal%20crest">sagittal crest</a>, which are otherwise found in horned and tusked animals that need strong muscles to push and fight. It also had a deep pit for the attachment of nuchal ligaments, which hold up the skull automatically. The <a href="occipital%20condyle">occipital condyle</a> was very wide and "Paraceratherium" appears to have had large, strong neck muscles, which allowed it to sweep its head strongly downwards while foraging from branches. One skull of "P. transouralicum" has a domed forehead, whereas others have flat foreheads, possibly because of sexual dimorphism. A brain <a href="endocast">endocast</a> of "P. transouralicum" shows it was only 8 percent of the skull length, while the brain of the Indian rhinoceros is 17.7 percent of its skull length.

The species of "Paraceratherium" are mainly discernible through skull characteristics. "P. bugtiense" has features such as relatively slender <a href="maxillae">maxillae</a> and premaxillae, shallow <a href="skull%20roofs">skull roofs</a>, mastoid-paroccipital processes that are relatively thin and placed back on the skull, a lambdoid crest, which extends less back, and an occipital condyle with a horizontal orientation, which it shares with "Dzungariotherium". "P. transouralicum" has robust maxillae and premaxillae, upturned zygomata, domed <a href="frontal%20bones">frontal bones</a>, thick mastoid-paroccipital processes, a lambdoid crest that extends back, and occipital condyles with a vertical orientation.

Unlike most primitive rhinoceroses, the front teeth of "Paraceratherium" were reduced to a single pair of incisors in either jaw, which were large and conical, and have been described as tusks. The upper incisors pointed downwards; the lower ones were shorter and pointed forwards. Among known rhinoceroses, this arrangement is unique to "Paraceratherium" and the related "Urtinotherium". The incisors may have been larger in males. The <a href="canine%20tooth">canine teeth</a> otherwise found behind the incisors were lost. The incisors were separated from the row of cheek teeth by a large <a href="diastema">diastema</a> (gap). This feature is found in mammals where the incisors and cheek teeth have different specialisations. The upper molars, except for the third upper molar that was V-shaped, had a pi-shaped (π) pattern and a reduced <a href="metastyle">metastyle</a>. The premolars only partially formed the pi pattern. Each molar was the size of a human fist; among mammals they were only exceeded in size by proboscideans, though they were small relative to the size of the skull. The lower cheek teeth were L-shaped, which is typical of rhinoceroses.

The British zoologist <a href="Robert%20M.%20Alexander">Robert M. Alexander</a> suggested in 1988 that overheating may have been a serious problem in "Paraceratherium" due to its size. According to Prothero, the best living analogues for "Paraceratherium" may be large mammals such as elephants, rhinoceroses and hippopotamuses. To aid in thermoregulation, these animals cool down during the day by resting in the shade or by wallowing in water and mud. They also forage and move mainly at night. Because of its large size, "Paraceratherium" would not have been able to run and move quickly, but they would have been able to cross large distances, which would be necessary in an environment with a scarcity of food. They may therefore have had large home ranges and have been migratory. Prothero suggests that animals as big as indricotheres would need very large home ranges or territories of at least and that, because of a scarcity of resources, there would have been little room in Asia for many populations or a multitude of nearly identical species and genera. This principle is called <a href="competitive%20exclusion">competitive exclusion</a>; it is used to explain how the black rhinoceros (a browser) and <a href="white%20rhinoceros">white rhinoceros</a> (a grazer) exploit different niches in the same areas of Africa.

Most terrestrial predators in their habitat were no bigger than a modern <a href="wolf">wolf</a> and were not a threat to "Paraceratherium". Adult individuals would be too large for any land predators to attack, but the young would have been vulnerable. Bite marks on bones from the Bugti beds indicate that even adults may have been preyed on by -long crocodiles, "<a href="Crocodylus%20bugtiensis">Crocodylus bugtiensis</a>". As in elephants, the gestation period of "Paraceratherium" may have been lengthy and individuals may have had long lifespans. "Paraceratherium" may have lived in small herds, perhaps consisting of females and their calves, which they protected from predators. It has been proposed that may be the maximum weight possible for land mammals, and "Paraceratherium" was close to this limit. The reasons mammals cannot reach the much larger size of sauropod dinosaurs are unknown. The reason may be ecological instead of <a href="biomechanics">biomechanical</a>, and perhaps related to reproduction strategies. Movement, sound, and other behaviours seen in <a href="Computer-generated%20imagery">CGI</a> documentaries such as "<a href="Walking%20With%20Beasts">Walking With Beasts</a>" are entirely conjectural.

The simple, low-crowned teeth indicate that "Paraceratherium" was a browser with a diet consisting of relatively soft leaves and shrubs. Later rhinoceroses were grazers, with high-crowned teeth because their diets contained grit that quickly wore down their teeth. Studies of <a href="mesowear">mesowear</a> on "Paraceratherium" teeth confirm the creatures had a diet of soft leaves; <a href="microwear">microwear</a> studies have yet to be conducted. <a href="Isotope%20analysis">Isotope analysis</a> shows that "Paraceratherium" fed chiefly on <a href="C3%20plants">C3 plants</a>, which are mainly leaves. Like its perissodactyl relatives, the horses, tapirs, and other rhinoceroses, "Paraceratherium" would have been a <a href="hindgut%20fermenter">hindgut fermenter</a>; it would extract relatively little nutrition from its food and would have to eat large volumes to survive. Like other large herbivores, "Paraceratherium" would have had a large digestive tract.

Granger and Gregory argued that the large incisors were used for defence or for loosening shrubs by moving the neck downwards, thereby acting as picks and levers. Tapirs use their proboscis to wrap around branches while stripping off bark with the front teeth; this ability would have been helpful to "Paraceratherium". Some Russian authors suggested that the tusks were probably used for breaking twigs, stripping bark and bending high branches and that, because species from the early Oligocene had larger tusks than later ones, they probably had a more bark than leaf based diet. Since the species involved are now known to have been contemporaneous, and that the differences in tusks are perhaps sexually dimorphic, the latter idea is not accepted today. Herds of "Paraceratherium" may have migrated while continuously foraging from tall trees, which smaller mammals could not reach. Osborn suggested that its mode of foraging would have been similar to that of the high-browsing <a href="giraffe">giraffe</a> and <a href="okapi">okapi</a>, rather than to modern rhinoceroses, whose heads are carried close to the ground.

Remains assignable to "Paraceratherium" have been found in early to late Oligocene (34–23 million years ago) formations across Eurasia, in modern-day China, Mongolia, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, and the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>. Their distribution may be correlated with the <a href="palaeogeographic">palaeogeographic</a> development of the Alpine-Himalayan mountain belt. The range of "Paraceratherium" finds implies that they inhabited a continuous landmass with a similar environment across it, but this is contradicted by palaeogeographic maps that show this area had various marine barriers, so the genus was successful in being widely distributed despite this. The fauna which coexisted with "Paraceratherium" included other rhinoceroses, <a href="artiodactyls">artiodactyls</a>, rodents, <a href="beardogs">beardogs</a>, weasels, <a href="hyaenodonts">hyaenodonts</a>, <a href="nimravids">nimravids</a> and cats.

The habitat of "Paraceratherium" appears to have varied across its range, based on the types of geological formations it has been found in. The <a href="Hsanda%20Gol%20Formation">Hsanda Gol Formation</a> of Mongolia represents an arid desert basin, and the environment is thought to have had few tall trees and limited brush cover, as the fauna consisted mainly of animals that fed from tree tops or close to the ground. A study of fossil pollen showed that much of China was woody shrubland, with plants such as <a href="saltbush">saltbush</a>, <a href="mormon%20tea">mormon tea</a> ("Ephedra"), and <a href="nitre%20bush">nitre bush</a> ("Nitraria"), all adapted to arid environments. Trees were rare, and concentrated near groundwater. The parts of China where "Paraceratherium" lived had <a href="dry%20lakes">dry lakes</a> and abundant <a href="sand%20dunes">sand dunes</a>, and the most common plant fossils are leaves of the desert-adapted "<a href="Palibinia">Palibinia</a>". Trees in Mongolia and China included birch, elm, oaks, and other <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> trees, while Siberia and Kazakhstan also had walnut trees. Dera Bugti in Pakistan had dry, temperate to subtropical forest.

The reasons "Paraceratherium" became extinct after surviving for about 11 million years are unknown, but it is unlikely that there was a single cause. Theorised reasons include climate change, low reproduction rate, and invasion by <a href="gomphothere">gomphothere</a> proboscideans from Africa in the late Oligocene (between 28 and 23 million years ago). Gomphotheres may have been able to considerably change the habitats they entered, in the same way that <a href="African%20elephants">African elephants</a> do today, by destroying trees and turning woodland into grassland. Once their food source became scarce and their numbers dwindled, "Paraceratherium" populations would have become more vulnerable to other threats. Large predators like "<a href="Hyainailurus">Hyainailurus</a>" and "<a href="Amphicyon">Amphicyon</a>" also entered Asia from Africa during the <a href="early%20Miocene">early Miocene</a> (between 23 and 16 million years ago); these may have predated "Paraceratherium" calves. Other herbivores also invaded Asia during this time.

Hepatorenal syndrome

Hepatorenal syndrome (often abbreviated HRS) is a life-threatening medical condition that consists of <a href="acute%20renal%20failure">rapid deterioration in kidney function</a> in individuals with <a href="cirrhosis">cirrhosis</a> or <a href="fulminant">fulminant</a> <a href="liver%20failure">liver failure</a>. HRS is usually fatal unless a <a href="liver%20transplantation">liver transplant</a> is performed, although various treatments, such as <a href="dialysis">dialysis</a>, can prevent advancement of the condition.

HRS can affect individuals with cirrhosis, severe <a href="alcoholic%20hepatitis">alcoholic hepatitis</a>, or liver failure, and usually occurs when liver function deteriorates rapidly because of a sudden insult such as an infection, <a href="upper%20gastrointestinal%20hemorrhage">bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract</a>, or overuse of <a href="diuretic">diuretic</a> medications. HRS is a relatively common complication of cirrhosis, occurring in 18% of people within one year of their diagnosis, and in 39% within five years of their diagnosis. Deteriorating <a href="liver">liver</a> function is believed to cause changes in the <a href="splanchnic%20circulation">circulation that supplies the intestines</a>, altering <a href="hemodynamics">blood flow</a> and blood vessel tone in the <a href="kidney">kidney</a>s. The kidney failure of HRS is a consequence of these changes in blood flow, rather than direct damage to the kidney. The diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome is based on laboratory tests of individuals susceptible to the condition. Two forms of hepatorenal syndrome have been defined: Type 1 HRS entails a rapidly progressive decline in kidney function, while type 2 HRS is associated with <a href="ascites">ascites</a> (fluid accumulation in the abdomen) that does not improve with standard <a href="diuretic">diuretic</a> medications.

The risk of death in hepatorenal syndrome is very high; the mortality of individuals with type 1 HRS is over 50% over the short term, as determined by historical <a href="case%20series">case series</a>. The only long-term treatment option for the condition is liver transplantation. While awaiting transplantation, people with HRS often receive other treatments that improve the abnormalities in blood vessel tone, including supportive care with medications, or the insertion of a <a href="transjugular%20intrahepatic%20portosystemic%20shunt">transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt</a> (TIPS), which is a small shunt placed to reduce blood pressure in the <a href="portal%20vein">portal vein</a>. Some patients may require <a href="dialysis">hemodialysis</a> to support kidney function, or a newer technique called <a href="liver%20dialysis">liver dialysis</a> which uses a dialysis circuit with <a href="albumin">albumin</a>-bound membranes to bind and remove toxins normally cleared by the liver, providing a means of <a href="artificial%20extracorporeal%20liver%20support">extracorporeal liver support</a> until transplantation can be performed.

Hepatorenal syndrome is a particular and common type of <a href="renal%20failure">kidney failure</a> that affects individuals with liver <a href="cirrhosis">cirrhosis</a> or, less commonly, with <a href="fulminant%20liver%20failure">fulminant liver failure</a>. The syndrome involves constriction of the blood vessels of the <a href="kidney">kidney</a>s and dilation of blood vessels in the splanchnic circulation, which supplies the intestines. The classification of hepatorenal syndrome identifies two categories of <a href="kidney%20failure">kidney failure</a>, termed "type 1" and "type 2" HRS, which both occur in individuals with either <a href="cirrhosis">cirrhosis</a> or <a href="fulminant%20liver%20failure">fulminant liver failure</a>. In both categories, the deterioration in kidney function is quantified either by an elevation in <a href="creatinine">creatinine</a> level in the blood, or by <a href="creatinine%20clearance">decreased clearance of creatinine in the urine</a>.

Type 1 HRS is characterized by rapidly progressive kidney failure, with a doubling of serum <a href="creatinine">creatinine</a> to a level greater than 221 <a href="micromole">μmol</a>/L (2.5 <a href="milligram">mg</a>/<a href="decilitre">dL</a>) or a halving of the <a href="creatinine%20clearance">creatinine clearance</a> to less than 20 mL/min over a period of less than two weeks. The prognosis of individuals with type 1 HRS is particularly grim, with a <a href="mortality%20rate">mortality rate</a> exceeding 50% after one month. Patients with type 1 HRS are usually ill, may have <a href="hypotension">low blood pressure</a>, and may require therapy with drugs to improve the strength of heart muscle contraction (<a href="inotrope">inotrope</a>s) or other drugs to maintain blood pressure (<a href="vasopressor">vasopressor</a>s). Unlike type II, in type I hepatorenal syndrome the renal failure improves with treatment and stabilizes.  Vasoconstrictors and volume expanders are the mainstay of treatment. 

In contrast, type 2 HRS is slower in onset and progression, and is not associated with an inciting event. It is defined by an increase in serum <a href="creatinine">creatinine</a> level to >133 μmol/L (1.5 mg/dL) or a creatinine clearance of less than 40 mL/min, and a urine sodium < 10 μmol/L. It also carries a poor outlook, with a median survival of approximately six months unless the affected individual undergoes liver transplantation. Type 2 HRS is thought to be part of a spectrum of illness associated with <a href="portal%20hypertension">increased pressures in the portal vein circulation</a>, which begins with the development of fluid in the abdomen (<a href="ascites">ascites</a>). The spectrum continues with "diuretic-resistant ascites", where the kidneys are unable to excrete sufficient sodium to clear the fluid even with the use of diuretic medications. Most individuals with type 2 HRS have diuretic-resistant ascites before they develop deterioration in kidney function.

Both types of hepatorenal syndrome share three major components: altered liver function, abnormalities in circulation, and kidney failure. As these phenomena may not necessarily produce symptoms until late in their course, individuals with hepatorenal syndrome are typically diagnosed with the condition on the basis of altered laboratory tests. Most people who develop HRS have cirrhosis, and may have signs and symptoms of the same, which can include <a href="jaundice">jaundice</a>, <a href="hepatic%20encephalopathy">altered mental status</a>, evidence of decreased nutrition, and the presence of <a href="ascites">ascites</a>. Specifically, the production of ascites that is resistant to the use of <a href="diuretic">diuretic</a> medications is characteristic of type 2 HRS. <a href="Oliguria">Oliguria</a>, which is a decrease in urine volume, may occur as a consequence of kidney failure; however, some individuals with HRS continue to produce a normal amount of urine. As these signs and symptoms may not necessarily occur in HRS, they are not included in the major and minor criteria for making a diagnosis of this condition; instead HRS is diagnosed in an individual at risk for the condition on the basis of the results of laboratory tests, and the exclusion of other causes.

Hepatorenal syndrome usually affects individuals with <a href="cirrhosis">cirrhosis</a> and elevated pressures in the <a href="portal%20vein">portal vein</a> system (termed <a href="portal%20hypertension">portal hypertension</a>). While HRS may develop in any type of <a href="cirrhosis">cirrhosis</a>, it is most common in individuals with <a href="cirrhosis">alcoholic cirrhosis</a>, particularly if there is concomitant <a href="alcoholic%20hepatitis">alcoholic hepatitis</a> identifiable on liver biopsies. HRS can also occur in individuals without cirrhosis, but with acute onset of liver failure, termed <a href="fulminant%20liver%20failure">fulminant liver failure</a>.

Certain precipitants of HRS have been identified in vulnerable individuals with cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure. These include bacterial infection, acute <a href="alcoholic%20hepatitis">alcoholic hepatitis</a>, or <a href="upper%20gastrointestinal%20hemorrhage">bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract</a>. <a href="Spontaneous%20bacterial%20peritonitis">Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis</a>, which is the infection of <a href="ascites">ascites</a> fluid, is the most common precipitant of HRS in cirrhotic individuals. HRS can sometimes be triggered by treatments for complications of liver disease: <a href="iatrogenic">iatrogenic</a> precipitants of HRS include the aggressive use of <a href="diuretic">diuretic</a> medications or the removal of large volumes of <a href="ascites">ascitic fluid</a> by <a href="paracentesis">paracentesis</a> from the abdominal cavity without compensating for fluid losses by intravenous replacement.

There can be many causes of kidney failure in individuals with cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure. Consequently, it is a challenge to distinguish hepatorenal syndrome from other entities that cause kidney failure in the setting of advanced liver disease. As a result, additional major and minor criteria have been developed to assist in the <a href="diagnosis">diagnosis</a> of hepatorenal syndrome.

The major criteria include liver disease with <a href="portal%20hypertension">portal hypertension</a>; <a href="kidney%20failure">kidney failure</a>; the absence of <a href="Shock%20%28circulatory%29">shock</a>, <a href="infection">infection</a>, recent treatment with medications that affect the function of the kidney (<a href="nephrotoxin">nephrotoxin</a>s), and fluid losses; the absence of sustained improvement in kidney function despite treatment with 1.5 litres of <a href="intravenous">intravenous</a> <a href="normal%20saline">normal saline</a>; the absence of <a href="proteinuria">proteinuria</a> (<a href="protein">protein</a> in the <a href="urine">urine</a>); and, the absence of kidney disease or obstruction of kidney outflow as seen on <a href="ultrasound">ultrasound</a>.

The minor criteria are the following: a <a href="oliguria">low urine volume</a> (less than per day), low <a href="sodium">sodium</a> concentration in the urine, a <a href="urine%20osmolality">urine osmolality</a> that is greater than that in the <a href="blood">blood</a>, the absence of <a href="red%20blood%20cells">red blood cells</a> in the urine, and a serum sodium concentration of less than 130 mmol/L.

Many other diseases of the kidney are associated with liver disease and must be excluded before making a diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome. Individuals with <a href="Renal%20failure">pre-renal kidney failure</a> do not have damage to the kidneys, but as in individuals with HRS, have kidney dysfunction due to decreased blood flow to the kidneys. Also, similarly to HRS, pre-renal kidney failure causes the formation of urine that has a very low sodium concentration. In contrast to HRS, however, pre-renal kidney failure usually responds to treatment with intravenous fluids, resulting in reduction in serum <a href="creatinine">creatinine</a> and increased excretion of sodium. <a href="Acute%20tubular%20necrosis">Acute tubular necrosis</a> (ATN) involves damage to the tubules of the kidney, and can be a complication in individuals with cirrhosis, because of exposure to toxic medications or the development of decreased blood pressure. Because of the damage to the tubules, ATN affected kidneys usually are unable to maximally resorb sodium from the urine. As a result, ATN can be distinguished from HRS on the basis of laboratory testing, as individuals with ATN will have urine sodium measurements that are much higher than in HRS; however, this may not always be the case in cirrhotics. Individuals with ATN also may have evidence of <a href="hyaline%20cast">hyaline cast</a>s or <a href="muddy-brown%20cast">muddy-brown cast</a>s in the urine on microscopy, whereas the urine of individuals with HRS is typically devoid of cellular material, as the kidneys have not been directly injured. Some viral infections of the liver, including <a href="hepatitis%20B">hepatitis B</a> and <a href="hepatitis%20C">hepatitis C</a> can also lead to inflammation of the <a href="glomerulonephritis">glomerulus</a> of the kidney. Other causes of kidney failure in individuals with liver disease include drug toxicity (notably, the antibiotic <a href="gentamicin">gentamicin</a>) or <a href="contrast%20nephropathy">contrast nephropathy</a>, caused by intravenous administration of <a href="contrast%20medium">contrast</a> agents used for medical imaging tests.

The <a href="kidney%20failure">kidney failure</a> in hepatorenal syndrome is believed to arise from abnormalities in <a href="blood%20vessel">blood vessel</a> tone in the kidneys. The predominant theory (termed the "underfill" theory) is that blood vessels in the kidney circulation are constricted because of the dilation of blood vessels in the <a href="splanchnic%20circulation">splanchnic circulation</a> (which supplies the <a href="intestines">intestines</a>), which is mediated by factors released by liver disease. <a href="Nitric%20oxide">Nitric oxide</a>, <a href="prostaglandins">prostaglandins</a>, and other vasoactive substances have been hypothesized as powerful mediators of splanchnic vasodilation in cirrhosis. The consequence of this phenomenon is a decrease in the "effective" volume of blood sensed by the <a href="juxtaglomerular%20apparatus">juxtaglomerular apparatus</a>, leading to the secretion of <a href="renin">renin</a> and the activation of the <a href="renin%E2%80%93angiotensin%20system">renin–angiotensin system</a>, which results in the vasoconstriction of vessels systemically and in the kidney specifically. However, the effect of this is insufficient to counteract the mediators of vasodilation in the splanchnic circulation, leading to persistent "underfilling" of the kidney circulation and worsening kidney vasoconstriction, leading to kidney failure.

Studies to quantify this theory have shown that there is an overall decreased <a href="systemic%20vascular%20resistance">systemic vascular resistance</a> in hepatorenal syndrome, but that the measured <a href="femoral%20artery">femoral</a> and kidney fractions of <a href="cardiac%20output">cardiac output</a> are respectively increased and reduced, suggesting that splanchnic <a href="vasodilation">vasodilation</a> is implicated in the kidney failure. Many vasoactive chemicals have been hypothesized as being involved in mediating the systemic hemodynamic changes, including <a href="atrial%20natriuretic%20factor">atrial natriuretic factor</a>, <a href="prostacyclin">prostacyclin</a>, <a href="thromboxane">thromboxane</a> A2, and <a href="endotoxin">endotoxin</a>. In addition to this, it has been observed that the administration of medications to counteract splanchnic vasodilation (such as <a href="ornipressin">ornipressin</a>, <a href="terlipressin">terlipressin</a>, and <a href="octreotide">octreotide</a>) leads to improvement in <a href="glomerular%20filtration%20rate">glomerular filtration rate</a> (which is a quantitative measure of kidney function) in patients with hepatorenal syndrome, providing further evidence that splanchnic vasodilation is a key feature of its pathogenesis.

The underfill theory involves activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, which leads to an increase in absorption of sodium from the kidney tubule (termed "renal sodium avidity") mediated by <a href="aldosterone">aldosterone</a>, which acts on <a href="mineralocorticoid%20receptor">mineralocorticoid receptor</a>s in the <a href="distal%20convoluted%20tubule">distal convoluted tubule</a>. This is believed to be a key step in the pathogenesis of <a href="ascites">ascites</a> in cirrhotics as well. It has been hypothesized that the progression from ascites to hepatorenal syndrome is a spectrum where splanchnic vasodilation defines both resistance to <a href="diuretic">diuretic</a> medications in ascites (which is commonly seen in type 2 HRS) and the onset of kidney vasoconstriction (as described above) leading to hepatorenal syndrome.

The risk of death in hepatorenal syndrome is very high; consequently, there is a significant emphasis on the identification of patients who are at risk for HRS, and prevention of triggers for onset of HRS. As <a href="infection">infection</a> (specifically <a href="spontaneous%20bacterial%20peritonitis">spontaneous bacterial peritonitis</a>) and <a href="upper%20gastrointestinal%20bleeding">gastrointestinal hemorrhage</a> are both complications in individuals with cirrhosis, and are common triggers for HRS, specific care is made in early identification and treatment of cirrhotics with these complications to prevent HRS. Some of the triggers for HRS are induced by treatment of <a href="ascites">ascites</a> and can be preventable. The aggressive use of <a href="diuretic">diuretic</a> medications should be avoided. In addition, many medications that are either used to treat cirrhotic complications (such as some antibiotics) or other conditions may cause sufficient impairment in kidney function in the cirrhotic to lead to HRS. Also, large volume <a href="paracentesis">paracentesis</a>—which is the removal of <a href="ascites">ascites</a> fluid from the abdomen using a needle or <a href="angiocath">catheter</a> in order to relieve discomfort—may cause enough alteration in hemodynamics to precipitate HRS, and should be avoided in individuals at risk. The concomitant infusion of <a href="albumin">albumin</a> can avert the circulatory dysfunction that occurs after large-volume paracentesis and may prevent HRS. Conversely, in individuals with very tense ascites, it has been hypothesized that removal of ascitic fluid may improve kidney function if it decreases the pressure on the <a href="renal%20vein">renal vein</a>s.

Individuals with ascites that have become infected spontaneously (termed <a href="spontaneous%20bacterial%20peritonitis">spontaneous bacterial peritonitis</a> or SBP) are at an especially high risk for the development of HRS. In individuals with SBP, one <a href="randomized%20controlled%20trial">randomized controlled trial</a> found that the administration of intravenous albumin on the day of admission and on the third day in hospital reduced both the rate of kidney insufficiency and the mortality rate.

The definitive treatment for hepatorenal syndrome is <a href="liver%20transplantation">liver transplantation</a>, and all other therapies can best be described as bridges to transplantation. While liver transplantation is by far the best available management option for HRS, the mortality of individuals with HRS has been shown to be as high as 25% within the first month after transplantation. Individuals with HRS and evidence of greater hepatic dysfunction (quantified as <a href="Model%20for%20end-stage%20liver%20disease">MELD</a> scores above 36) have been found to be at greatest risk of early mortality after liver transplantation. A further deterioration of kidney function even after liver transplantation in individuals with HRS has been demonstrated in several studies; however, this is transient and thought to be due to the use of <a href="nephrotoxin">medications with toxicity to the kidneys</a>, and specifically the introduction of <a href="immunosuppressant">immunosuppressant</a>s such as <a href="tacrolimus">tacrolimus</a> and <a href="cyclosporine">cyclosporine</a> that are known to worsen kidney function. Over the long-term, however, individuals with HRS who are the recipients of liver transplants almost universally recover kidney function, and studies show that their survival rates at three years are similar to those who have received liver transplants for reasons other than HRS.

In anticipation of liver transplantation (which may be associated with considerable in-hospital delay), several other strategies have been found to be beneficial in preserving kidney function. These include the use of intravenous <a href="albumin">albumin</a> infusion, medications (for which the best evidence is for analogues of <a href="vasopressin">vasopressin</a>, which causes splanchnic vasoconstriction), radiological shunts to decrease <a href="portal%20hypertension">pressure in the portal vein</a>, <a href="dialysis">dialysis</a>, and a specialized albumin-bound membrane dialysis system termed <a href="molecular%20adsorbents%20recirculation%20system">molecular adsorbents recirculation system</a> (MARS) or <a href="liver%20dialysis">liver dialysis</a>.

Many major studies showing improvement in kidney function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome have involved expansion of the volume of the <a href="blood%20plasma">plasma</a> with <a href="human%20serum%20albumin">albumin</a> given intravenously. The quantity of albumin administered intravenously varies: one cited regimen is 1 gram of albumin per kilogram of body weight intravenously on the first day, followed by 20 to 40 grams daily. Notably, studies have shown that treatment with albumin alone is inferior to treatment with other medications in conjunction with albumin; most studies evaluating pre-transplant therapies for HRS involve the use of albumin in conjunction with other medical or procedural treatment.

<a href="Midodrine">Midodrine</a> is an <a href="adrenergic%20agonist">alpha-agonist</a> and <a href="octreotide">octreotide</a> is an analogue of <a href="somatostatin">somatostatin</a>, a hormone involved in regulation of <a href="splanchnic%20circulation">blood vessel tone in the gastrointestinal tract</a>. The medications are respectively systemic vasoconstrictors and inhibitors of splanchnic vasodilation, and were not found to be useful when used individually in treatment of hepatorenal syndrome. However, one study of 13 patients with hepatorenal syndrome showed significant improvement in kidney function when the two were used together (with midodrine given orally, octreotide given <a href="Subcutaneous%20injection">subcutaneous</a>ly and both dosed according to blood pressure), with three patients surviving to discharge. Another nonrandomized, observational study of individuals with HRS treated with subcutaneous octreotide and oral midodrine showed that there was increased survival at 30 days.

The <a href="Vasopressin%23Pharmacology">vasopressin analogue</a> <a href="ornipressin">ornipressin</a> was found in a number of studies to be useful in improvement of kidney function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome, but has been limited in its use, as it can cause severe <a href="ischemia">ischemia</a> to major organs. <a href="Terlipressin">Terlipressin</a> is a vasopressin analogue that has been found in one large study to be useful for improving kidney function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome with a lesser incidence of ischemia but is not available in the United States. A key criticism of all of these medical therapies has been heterogeneity in the populations investigated and the use of kidney function, instead of mortality, as an outcome measure.

Other agents that have been investigated for use in treatment of HRS include <a href="pentoxifylline">pentoxifylline</a>, <a href="acetylcysteine">acetylcysteine</a>, and <a href="misoprostol">misoprostol</a>. The evidence for all of these therapies is based on either <a href="case%20series">case series</a>, or in the case of pentoxifylline, extrapolated from a subset of patients treated for <a href="alcoholic%20hepatitis">alcoholic hepatitis</a>.

A <a href="transjugular%20intrahepatic%20portosystemic%20shunt">transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt</a> (TIPS) involves the decompression of the high pressures in the <a href="portal%20hypertension">portal</a> circulation by placing a small stent between a <a href="Hepatic%20portal%20vein">portal</a> and <a href="hepatic%20vein">hepatic vein</a>. This is done through radiologically guided catheters which are passed into the hepatic vein either through the <a href="internal%20jugular%20vein">internal jugular vein</a> or the <a href="femoral%20vein">femoral vein</a>. Theoretically, a decrease in portal pressures is thought to reverse the hemodynamic phenomena that ultimately lead to the development of hepatorenal syndrome. TIPS has been shown to improve kidney function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome. Complications of TIPS for treatment of HRS include the worsening of <a href="hepatic%20encephalopathy">hepatic encephalopathy</a> (as the procedure involves the forced creation of a porto-systemic shunt, effectively bypassing the ability of the liver to clear toxins), inability to achieve adequate reduction in portal pressure, and bleeding.

<a href="Liver%20dialysis">Liver dialysis</a> involves extracorporeal dialysis to remove toxins from the circulation, usually through the addition of a second dialysis circuit that contains an albumin-bound membrane. The <a href="Liver%20dialysis%23Liver%20dialysis%20devices">molecular adsorbents recirculation system</a> (MARS) has shown some utility as a bridge to transplantation in patients with hepatorenal syndrome, yet the technique is still nascent.

<a href="Renal%20replacement%20therapy">Renal replacement therapy</a> may be required to bridge individuals with hepatorenal syndrome to liver transplantation, although the condition of the patient may dictate the modality used. The use of <a href="dialysis">dialysis</a>, however, does not lead to recuperation or preservation of kidney function in patients with HRS, and is essentially only used to avoid complications of kidney failure until transplantation can take place. In patients who undergo <a href="hemodialysis">hemodialysis</a>, there may even be an increased risk of mortality due to <a href="hypotension">low blood pressure</a> in patients with HRS, although appropriate studies have yet to be performed. As a result, the role of renal replacement therapy in patients with HRS remains unclear.

As the majority of individuals with hepatorenal syndrome have <a href="cirrhosis">cirrhosis</a>, much of the epidemiological data on HRS comes from the cirrhotic population. The condition is quite common: approximately 10% of individuals admitted to hospital with <a href="ascites">ascites</a> have HRS. A retrospective case series of cirrhotic patients treated with terlipressin suggested that 20.0% of acute kidney failure in cirrhotics was due to type 1 HRS, and 6.6% was due to type 2 HRS. It is estimated that 18% of individuals with <a href="cirrhosis">cirrhosis</a> and <a href="ascites">ascites</a> will develop HRS within one year of their diagnosis with cirrhosis, and 39% of these individuals will develop HRS within five years of diagnosis. Three independent risk factors for the development of HRS in cirrhotics have been identified: liver size, plasma renin activity, and serum sodium concentration.

The prognosis of these patients is grim with untreated patients having an extremely short survival. The severity of liver disease (as evidenced by the <a href="Model%20for%20End-Stage%20Liver%20Disease">MELD</a> score) has been shown to be a determinant of outcome. Some patients without cirrhosis develop HRS, with an incidence of about 20% seen in one study of ill patients with <a href="alcoholic%20hepatitis">alcoholic hepatitis</a>.

The first reports of kidney failure occurring in individuals with chronic liver diseases were from the late 19th century by Frerichs and Flint. However, the hepatorenal syndrome was first defined as acute kidney failure that occurred in the setting of <a href="biliary%20system">biliary surgery</a>. The syndrome was soon re-associated with advanced liver disease, and, in the 1950s, was clinically defined by <a href="Sheila%20Sherlock">Sherlock</a>, Hecker, Papper and Vessin as being associated with systemic hemodynamic abnormalities and high mortality. Hecker and Sherlock specifically identified that individuals with HRS had low urinary output, very low <a href="sodium">sodium</a> in the urine, and no protein in the urine. Murray Epstein was the first to characterize splanchnic vasodilation and kidney vasoconstriction as the key alterations in hemodynamics in patients with the syndrome. The functional nature of the kidney impairment in HRS was crystallized by studies demonstrating that kidneys transplanted from patients with hepatorenal syndrome returned to function in the new host, leading to the hypothesis that hepatorenal syndrome was a systemic condition and not a kidney disease. The first systematic attempt to define hepatorenal syndrome was made in 1994 by the International Ascites Club, a group of <a href="hepatologist">liver specialists</a>. The more recent history of HRS has involved elucidation of the various vasoactive mediators that cause the splanchnic and kidney blood flow abnormalities of the condition.

Thief II

Thief II: The Metal Age is a 2000 <a href="stealth%20game">stealth</a> video game developed by <a href="Looking%20Glass%20Studios">Looking Glass Studios</a> and published by <a href="Eidos%20Interactive">Eidos Interactive</a>. Like its predecessor "", the game follows <a href="Garrett%20%28character%29">Garrett</a>, a master thief who works in and around a <a href="steampunk">steampunk</a> metropolis called the City. The player assumes the role of Garrett as he unravels a conspiracy related to a new religious sect. Garrett takes on missions such as <a href="burglary">burglaries</a> and <a href="frameup">frameup</a>s, while trying to avoid detection by guards and automated security.

"Thief II" was designed to build on the foundation of its predecessor. In response to feedback from players of "Thief", the team placed a heavy focus on urban stealth in the sequel, and they minimized the use of monsters and maze-like levels. The game was made with the third iteration of the <a href="Dark%20Engine">Dark Engine</a>, which had been used previously to develop "Thief" and "<a href="System%20Shock%202">System Shock 2</a>". "Thief II" was announced at the 1999 <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a>, as part of an extended contract between Looking Glass and Eidos to release games in the <a href="Thief%20%28series%29">"Thief" series</a>. Looking Glass neared bankruptcy as the game was developed, and the company was kept running by advances from Eidos.

"Thief II" received positive reviews from critics, and its initial sales were stronger than those of its predecessor. However, the game's royalties were processed slowly, which compounded Looking Glass's financial troubles. As a result, the company closed in May 2000, with plans for "Thief III" cancelled. The third game in the series, entitled "", was developed by <a href="Ion%20Storm">Ion Storm</a> and published by Eidos in 2004. "Thief 2X: Shadows of the Metal Age", a widely praised expansion <a href="Mod%20%28video%20gaming%29">mod</a> for "Thief II", was released in 2005. In 2014, <a href="Square%20Enix">Square Enix</a> published a <a href="Thief%20%282014%20video%20game%29">reboot of the series</a>, developed by <a href="Eidos%20Montr%C3%A9al">Eidos Montréal</a>.

"Thief II" is a <a href="stealth%20game">stealth game</a> that takes place from a <a href="first%20person%20%28video%20games%29">first-person perspective</a> in a <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">three-dimensional</a> (3D) graphical environment. The player seeks to complete mission objectives and to evade the notice of opponents such as guards. The player must minimize the visibility and audibility of the <a href="player%20character">player character</a>, <a href="Garrett%20%28character%29">Garrett</a>, to escape detection. Players try to avoid lit areas and loud <a href="flooring">flooring</a> in favor of shadows and quiet flooring. A light monitor on the <a href="HUD%20%28video%20gaming%29">heads-up display</a> (HUD) indicates the player character's visibility. While it is possible for the player character to engage in direct combat, he is easily defeated.

The game's 15 missions take place in large <a href="Level%20%28video%20gaming%29">levels</a> that can be confronted in multiple ways. Guards may be knocked out with a <a href="Baton%20%28law%20enforcement%29">blackjack</a> or killed with a bow or sword, and their fallen bodies may be picked up and hidden. In addition to human enemies, the game features security <a href="automaton">automaton</a>s and surveillance cameras. While completing objectives such as <a href="frameup">frameup</a>s and blackmail, the player steals valuables that may be used to purchase thieving gear between missions. The player's main tools are specialized arrows, including water arrows to douse lights, moss arrows to dampen the player character's footsteps and rope arrows to reach higher ground.

"Thief II" is designed to be played methodically, and the player plans ahead by scouting, reading the game's map and observing patrol patterns. The player character has a <a href="Zoom%20lens">zooming</a> mechanical eye, which connects to throwable "Scouting Orb" cameras. One Scouting Orb may be deployed at a time; when it lands, the player views the game world from its perspective until normal play is resumed. The player listens for noises, such as footsteps and humming, to determine the locations of enemies. On the highest of the game's three <a href="Balance%20%28game%20design%29%23Difficulty%20level">difficulty levels</a>, killing humans results in a <a href="game%20over">game over</a>, and in certain missions the player must not knock out any guards.
Like its predecessor "", "Thief II" is set in a <a href="steampunk">steampunk</a> metropolis called the City, whose appearance resembles that of both medieval and <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a> cities. Magic and steam technology exist side by side, and three factions—the manipulative and enigmatic Keepers, the technology-focused Hammerites and the "pagan" worshippers of the <a href="Pan%20%28god%29">Pan</a>-like Trickster god—are in operation. "Thief II" takes place one year after the first game. In the aftermath of the Trickster's defeat and the failure of his plan to revert the world to a wild, primitive state, a schism in the Hammerite religion spawns the "Mechanist" sect, which fanatically values technological progress. The new inventions of the Mechanists are used by a resurgent police force to crack down on crime. The pagans are in disarray, and have been driven into the wilderness beyond the City. From there, they engage in <a href="guerrilla%20warfare">guerrilla warfare</a> against the Mechanists. The Keeper faction is dormant as the game begins.

The game continues the story of Garrett (voiced by <a href="Stephen%20Russell">Stephen Russell</a>), the cynical master thief who defeated the Trickster. Pursuing Garrett is the new sheriff, Gorman Truart (voiced by Sam Babbitt), who has imposed a <a href="zero%20tolerance">zero tolerance</a> policy on crime. Viktoria (voiced by <a href="Terri%20Brosius">Terri Brosius</a>), the former ally of the Trickster, eventually joins with Garrett to combat the Mechanists. The game's primary antagonist is the founder of the Mechanists, Father Karras (also voiced by Russell), a mentally unstable inventor who despises the natural world.

The game begins as Garrett continues his life as a thief. However, he is betrayed by his fence and ambushed after an early mission, and he determines that Truart, the local sheriff, is hunting him. Keepers take Garrett to hear a prophecy about the "Metal Age", which he ignores. As Garrett leaves, one of the Keepers informs him that Truart had been hired to kill him, and he gives Garrett a letter that directs him to eavesdrop on a Mechanist meeting. There, Garrett overhears Truart and Father Karras discussing the conversion of <a href="street%20people">street people</a> into mindless "Servants", who wear masks that emit a red vapor capable of reducing themselves and nearby humans to rust. Truart promises to provide Karras with twenty victims for the Servant project, not realizing that Karras is recording his words for use in blackmail. Garrett steals the recording from a <a href="safe%20deposit%20box">safe deposit box</a>, in order to coerce Truart into revealing his employer.

However, Garrett finds Truart murdered at his estate. Evidence at the crime scene leads him to spy on the <a href="police%20officer">police officer</a> Lt. Mosley. Garrett sees Mosley deliver a suspicious letter, which is carried through a <a href="Portals%20in%20fiction">portal</a> by a wounded pagan. Garrett enters the portal and finds himself outside the City, and he follows the pagan's trail of blood to Viktoria, who persuades Garrett to join her against the Mechanists. On a lead from Viktoria, he infiltrates Karras' office to learn about the "Cetus Project", and inadvertently discovers that Karras is giving Servants to the City's nobles. Garrett travels to a Mechanist base to find out more about the Cetus Project, which is revealed to be a <a href="submarine">submarine</a>. In order to locate and kidnap a high-ranking Mechanist named Brother Cavador, Garrett stows away in the vehicle.

After delivering Cavador to Viktoria, Garrett steals a Servant mask to learn about a Mechanist technology called a "Cultivator". Meanwhile, Karras hides inside the Mechanist cathedral in preparation for his plan. Garrett and Viktoria learn that it is the Cultivators inside Servant masks which emit red vapor, or "rust gas". Karras had provided Servants to nobles with gardens in order to set off an <a href="Apocalypse">apocalyptic</a> chain reaction. Viktoria plans to lure the Servants into the <a href="Hermetic%20seal">hermetically sealed</a> Mechanist cathedral before Karras activates their masks, but Garrett believes this to be too dangerous and leaves. Viktoria goes to the cathedral alone and dies while filling it with plants, and Garrett completes her plan, killing Karras in the rust gas. Afterward, Garrett is approached by a Keeper who explains that Karras' scheme and Viktoria's death had been prophesied. Garrett demands to know the rest of the Keepers' prophecies as the game ends.

Looking Glass Studios began designing "Thief II" in January 1999. The team's goal was to build on the foundation of "Thief: The Dark Project", a game that "Thief II" project director Steve Pearsall later said was an experiment. He explained that the team had played it safe by including certain "exploration ... or adventure oriented" missions with "jumping and climbing puzzles" in "Thief", and that the new game was significantly more focused on stealth. Combat was given less prominence than in the original. Based on feedback from players and reviewers of "Thief", the team decided to scale back the use of maze-like levels and monsters such as <a href="zombie">zombie</a>s in favor of urban environments and human enemies. Pearsall stated that "Thief"s monsters were negatively received because, unlike the game's human enemies, they did not clearly indicate when they noticed the player. The team sought to remedy this problem by improving the audio cues given by non-human enemies in the sequel.

Production of "Thief II" commenced in February. Looking Glass chose to compose the game's team of "half the original designers and half new blood", according to executive producer James Poole. The company tried to select people who meshed well both personally and creatively, in an attempt to guarantee a smooth development cycle. Adrenaline Vault editor-in-chief <a href="Emil%20Pagliarulo">Emil Pagliarulo</a> was hired as a junior designer, in part because of his positive review of "Thief". Rich "zdim" Carlson and <a href="Iikka%20Ker%C3%A4nen">Iikka Keränen</a> joined from <a href="Ion%20Storm">Ion Storm</a>'s "<a href="Daikatana">Daikatana</a>" team, and Looking Glass contractor <a href="Terri%20Brosius">Terri Brosius</a> was hired as a full-time designer. One-third of the team was female, which Pearsall believed contributed to a strong <a href="group%20dynamics">group dynamic</a>. As was typical at Looking Glass, the "Thief II" team worked in a wall-less space called a "pit", which allowed them to converse easily. Describing the work environment at the time, writer Laura Baldwin noted that "conversations dash madly about the room, [and] when someone is demonstrating something interesting everyone gravitates over to look."

During the first months of development, the team regularly gathered to watch films pertinent to Garrett's character and to the game's visual design, such as "<a href="The%20Third%20Man">The Third Man</a>", "<a href="The%20Castle%20of%20Cagliostro">The Castle of Cagliostro</a>", "<a href="M%20%281931%20film%29">M</a>" and "<a href="Metropolis%20%281927%20film%29">Metropolis</a>". Pearsall said that the latter two films were "Thief II"s "biggest aesthetic influences", while the main inspiration for its plot was Umberto Eco's novel "<a href="The%20Name%20of%20the%20Rose">The Name of the Rose</a>". The team also drew influence from <a href="Fritz%20Leiber">Fritz Leiber</a>'s "<a href="Fafhrd%20and%20the%20Gray%20Mouser">Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser</a>". The game's story was written in the <a href="three-act%20structure">three-act structure</a>: Garrett was intended to transition from his "cynical self" in the first act to a <a href="private%20investigator">private investigator</a> in the second, and to a character similar to <a href="James%20Bond">James Bond</a> in the third. The City's technology and architecture were influenced by the appearance of Victorian London, and certain areas were given an <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a> theme to provide "sort of a "Batman" feel", in reference to the <a href="Batman%20%281989%20film%29">1989 film</a>. Lead artist Mark Lizotte captured over two-thousand photographs during his vacation in Europe, and these were the basis for many of the game's <a href="Texture%20mapping">textures</a>.

"Thief II" was built with the third iteration of the <a href="Dark%20Engine">Dark Engine</a>, which had been used previously for "Thief" and "<a href="System%20Shock%202">System Shock 2</a>". According to Pearsall, the Dark Engine had become "a very well understood development environment", which made for an easier production process. Engine updates created for "System Shock 2", such as support for <a href="High%20color">16-bit color</a>, were carried over to "Thief II". The average <a href="3D%20modeling">character model</a> in "Thief II" was given close to double the <a href="Polygon%20%28computer%20graphics%29">polygons</a> of the average model in "Thief", with much of the added detail focused on characters' heads. This was an attempt to give the characters a "more organic" look. Certain <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) routines written into the Dark Engine, which allowed enemies to notice changes in the environment such as open doors, had not been used in "Thief" or in "System Shock 2 "but were implemented in "Thief II". Weather effects such as fog and rain were added, and technology from "<a href="Flight%20Unlimited%20III">Flight Unlimited III</a>" was used to generate the sky and clouds.

"Thief II" was announced during the <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> on May 13, 1999, as part of a contract between Looking Glass and <a href="Eidos%20Interactive">Eidos Interactive</a> to release four new games in the <a href="Thief%20%28series%29">"Thief" series</a>, beginning with "Thief Gold". The deal had been signed on May 7, roughly three months after "Thief II" entered production. A <a href="Technology%20demonstration">tech demo</a> of the game, which Bruce Geryk of <a href="Games%20Domain">Games Domain</a> described as "about three rooms with some Mages", was displayed on the show floor. The demo was used to showcase the updated Dark Engine, which featured support for colored lighting, higher polygon models and larger environments. The team revealed their intention to include more levels with human enemies, and announced a projected release date of spring 2000. Plans to include a <a href="Cooperative%20gameplay">cooperative multiplayer</a> mode were also detailed at the show. <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Jason Bates noted that the "Thief II" display attracted "a bit of a buzz and a small crowd of dedicated onlookers".

By July, the team had begun initial construction of the game's levels. "Thief II"s increased focus on stealth necessitated new level design concepts: the most stealth-based missions in "Thief" had centered on urban <a href="burglary">burglary</a>, but Pearsall explained that this "would get tired pretty fast" if repeated in every level. The team diversified "Thief II" by designing missions with such objectives as kidnapping, blackmail and eavesdropping. The first two levels were designed to seamlessly introduce new players to the core <a href="game%20mechanics">game mechanics</a>, without a <a href="tutorial">tutorial</a> mission that might lose the interest of experienced players. When creating a mission, the team would often begin by deciding on the player's objective, after which they would produce a rough <a href="level%20design">level design</a>. The mission would then undergo a <a href="peer%20review">peer review</a> to determine if it should be added to the game. Each of the game's levels was a team effort rather than the work of a single designer. Designer <a href="Randy%20Smith%20%28game%20designer%29">Randy Smith</a> explained that, while "Thief"s levels had been designed to fit a pre-existing story, the "Thief II" team "tried to think of really good missions first" and then adjusted the plot to suit them. He noted that it was highly difficult to harmonize the two.

The game's sound team was composed of Kemal Amarasingham, Damin Djawadi and audio director <a href="Eric%20Brosius">Eric Brosius</a>. According to Brosius, each member of the audio department did "everything", without clear demarcations between roles. Like "Thief", "Thief II" features a sound engine that simulates <a href="Sound%23Propagation">propagation</a> in real-time. To achieve this effect, each level's geometry was input both to the <a href="level%20editor">level editor</a> and to a "separate [sound] database", which mapped how sound would realistically propagate based on "the physical room characteristics [... and] how all the different rooms and areas are connected together". For example, noise travels freely through an open door but is blocked when the door is closed. The team used the new "occlusion" feature in <a href="Environmental%20Audio%20Extensions">EAX</a> 2.0 to make "Thief II"s sound environment more realistic and to allow the player to listen through doors. The game features more sound effects, music and speech than the original "Thief". "Thief II"s <a href="Video%20game%20music">score</a>, as with that of its predecessor, was designed to "blur ambient [sound] and music" together. However, Brosius later stated that, while "Thief"s soundtrack is composed of "simple and hypnotic" loops only a few seconds in length, "Thief II" features longer and "more thoughtfully" constructed pieces. He believed that this method had positive aspects, but that it resulted in a less immersive audio environment.

Artist Dan Thron returned to create the game's cutscenes, with assistance from Jennifer Hrabota-Lesser. Thron later called Hrabota-Lesser "one of the greatest artists I've ever seen". The cutscenes, which "<a href="Computer%20Games%20Magazine">Computer Games Magazine</a>" called "unique", feature multiple layers of artwork and footage of live actors filmed against a <a href="Chroma%20key">green screen</a>. These components were combined and animated in <a href="Adobe%20After%20Effects">Adobe After Effects</a>. The technique had been developed for the original "Thief", as an evolution of designer <a href="Ken%20Levine%20%28game%20developer%29">Ken Levine</a>'s suggestion to use <a href="motion%20comic">motion comic</a> cutscenes. <a href="David%20Lynch">David Lynch</a>'s films "<a href="Eraserhead">Eraserhead</a>" and "<a href="The%20Elephant%20Man%20%28film%29">The Elephant Man</a>" were important influences on their style.

By October 1999, the team had cut the game's multiplayer feature. Pearsall explained that Looking Glass did not "have the resources to do a new kind of multiplayer and ship a finely tuned single-player game". Plans were announced in January 2000 to release a multiplayer-only "Thief" game shortly after the completion of "Thief II". As "Thief II"s development continued, Looking Glass experienced extreme financial troubles. The company's <a href="Marc%20LeBlanc">Marc LeBlanc</a> later said that "Eidos was writing a check every week to cover our burn rate" during the last months of the project. The game's final cost was roughly $2.5 million. According to company head <a href="Paul%20Neurath">Paul Neurath</a>, Eidos informed Looking Glass that "it was not an option" for "Thief II" to miss its release date, and that there would be "dire consequences if [we] missed by even a day". An anonymous Looking Glass staffer later told <a href="Salon.com">Salon.com</a> that Eidos "told us basically to ship ["Thief II"] by their fiscal quarter or die".

By January, Pearsall confirmed that the game had reached <a href="Software%20release%20life%20cycle%23Beta">beta</a>, and that most of the team's energy was being spent "tuning, polishing, and fixing bugs". He noted in early February that "Thief II" had been produced almost entirely on schedule. The company slipped behind near the end of the project and entered <a href="wikt%3Acrunch%20time">crunch time</a> to make up the loss. On February 24, "Thief II" producer Michael McHale announced that the game had reached "feature freeze", and that the team was in "super crunch mode". Numerous <a href="Game%20testing">game testers</a> from Eidos joined the project. However, McHale said that the team was energized and that "spirits [were] high". Certain employees slept in the office and avoided bathing so that the game could reach its March deadline. LeBlanc later stated his belief that the game was rushed, and that its quality suffered as a result. Nevertheless, the team met their goal, and the game was released on March 23, 2000. Eidos expedited the company's payment for completing the game.

"Thief 2" debuted high on the bestsellers list for computer games, and its initial sales were better than those of its commercially successful predecessor. By November 2000, its global sales had surpassed 220,000 copies; "PC Zone" described these figures as "commercial acclaim." The United States alone accounted for 67,084 sales by the end of 2000, which drew in revenues of $2.37 million. The game later received a "Silver" sales award by the <a href="Entertainment%20and%20Leisure%20Software%20Publishers%20Association">Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association</a> (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. "Thief II" also received positive reviews from critics, with an aggregate score of 87/100 on <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> and 89% on <a href="GameRankings">GameRankings</a>.

"<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>"s Thomas L. McDonald wrote that "everything in "Thief II" is bigger, sharper, better, and more effective" than in its predecessor. He enjoyed its story and called its levels "vast and intricate", with "astonishingly complex and often beautiful" architecture; but he found the game's graphics to be somewhat lackluster. McDonald summarized "Thief II" as a unique "gamer's game". Jim Preston of "<a href="PC%20Gamer%20US">PC Gamer US</a>" considered the game to be "more focused and polished than the original", and he praised the removal of "zombie battles". While he faulted its graphics, he summarized it as "one hell of a good game".

Jasen Torres of "<a href="GameFan">GameFan</a>" wrote, "If you liked "Thief", you'll love "Thief 2: The Metal Age"; it's more of the stuff that made "Thief" great, with less of the annoying stuff". He applauded the removal of "zombie killer" missions and believed the game's sound to be "superior to any other game". He considered its story to be "good" but "nothing great" and its graphics to be "decent"; but he commented that the game was "really all about the gameplay", which he praised as "quite compelling and fun". Benjamin E. Sones of "<a href="Computer%20Games%20Magazine">Computer Games Magazine</a>" considered the game's story to be "quite good", but he faulted Looking Glass for failing to detail the events of the first game for new players. He wrote that "Thief II"s graphics were passable but that its sound design was "phenomenal". Sones praised its missions as "very well crafted", and noted that they gave the impression of being in "a living, breathing world." He summarized, "It may not be perfect, but "Thief 2" has got it where it counts".

Charles Harold of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" called the game a "refreshing alternative to games that glorify violence". He found its story to be "slight", but he lauded its world as "amazingly alive" and its AI as a "remarkable impersonation of real intelligence". Writing for "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>", Barry Brenesal commented that "Thief II" "provides a solid gaming experience" but "doesn't startle like its predecessor". He wrote that its missions featured a "great deal of variety", and he praised their "ability to casually suggest a much larger world", but he complained that they were linear. He considered the game's writing to be "among the best in the business". While Brenesal enjoyed the game's textures and lighting, he noted the low detail of the game's human models, whose animations he found to be "arthritic". "<a href="PC%20Zone">PC Zone</a>"s Paul Presley wrote that the game's levels were larger but easier than those of "Thief", and he considered their objectives to be somewhat linear. He found "Thief II"s graphics to be dated and wrote that its lack of real-time lighting "tends to give each environment a sort of 'false' quality". However, he believed that the game "still has enough atmosphere to immerse you", and he praised its sound design. Presley considered the game to be a straightforward rehash of its predecessor, and he finished, "A more clear-cut case of sequel-itis there has never been."

While "Thief II" performed well commercially, Looking Glass was not set to receive royalties for several months. The company had struggled financially since the commercial failures of its self-published games "" and "<a href="British%20Open%20Championship%20Golf">British Open Championship Golf</a>". Looking Glass's "<a href="Flight%20Unlimited%20III">Flight Unlimited III</a>" had flopped at retail, and the development of "<a href="Jane%27s%20Attack%20Squadron">Jane's Attack Squadron</a>" had gone over budget and fallen behind schedule. A deal to co-develop the stealth game "Deep Cover" with <a href="Irrational%20Games">Irrational Games</a> had recently collapsed. According to Looking Glass's Tim Stellmach, the delay in "Thief II" royalties "faced [us] with the prospect of running out of money." Looking Glass management signed a deal in which Eidos Interactive would acquire the company, but Eidos fell into a sudden financial crisis, in part because of the failure of <a href="Ion%20Storm">Ion Storm</a>'s $40 million game "<a href="Daikatana">Daikatana</a>". These factors led to the closure of Looking Glass on May 24, 2000, with the planned "Thief II" successors "Thief II Gold" and "Thief III" cancelled.

The "Thief" series had been planned as a trilogy, and work on "Thief III" was "in a fairly advanced stage" when Looking Glass closed, according to "PC Zone"s Keith Pullin. Randy Smith and Terri Brosius were appointed as lead designers, and they developed the game's concept over several months. In an open letter published after the company's bankruptcy, Smith wrote that the third game would have taken place in an "open-ended, self-directed city", and that its plot would have centered on the Keepers. Brosius suggested that "Thief III" would have seen Garrett "accept[ing] that there are consequences to his actions", and that he would likely have become "ready to give, rather than always take." The player would have uncovered the game's story gradually, while exploring a <a href="Nonlinear%20gameplay">free-roam environment</a>. Serious plans had been made to include co-operative multiplayer, and a new engine, Siege, had been in production. When Looking Glass closed, its assets were liquidated and the "Thief" intellectual property was sold at auction. This raised doubts that the "Thief" trilogy would be completed, a situation that <a href="Salon.com">Salon.com</a> writer Wagner James Au compared to <a href="Lucasfilm">Lucasfilm</a> closing after the release of "<a href="The%20Empire%20Strikes%20Back">The Empire Strikes Back</a>". However, following rumors, Eidos announced on August 9, 2000 that it had purchased the rights to "Thief".

Development of "Thief III" was delegated to the <a href="Warren%20Spector">Warren Spector</a>-supervised Ion Storm, which had recently completed "<a href="Deus%20Ex%20%28video%20game%29">Deus Ex</a>". According to Spector, "Thief III" would have been given to <a href="Core%20Design">Core Design</a> or <a href="Crystal%20Dynamics">Crystal Dynamics</a> had he not accepted it. The game was announced for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a> and the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a>. On August 10, Spector commented that Ion Storm's first goal was to assemble a core team, composed in part of former Looking Glass employees, to design and plot the game. "Thief II" team members Randy Smith, Lulu Lamer, Emil Pagliarulo and Terri Brosius were hired to begin the project. On August 16, Ion Storm announced its hires, and stated that concept work on "Thief III" would begin in September. The team planned to "wrap up [the] loose ends" of the series, and they built directly upon the "Thief III" concept work done at Looking Glass. "Thief III" was eventually renamed "", and it was released for Windows and the <a href="Xbox%20%28console%29">Xbox</a> on May 25, 2004.

In May 2009, after several months of rumors, a fourth game in the "Thief" series was announced by "" developer <a href="Eidos%20Montr%C3%A9al">Eidos Montréal</a>. It was unveiled in the April 2013 issue of "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>". The game, entitled "<a href="Thief%20%282014%20video%20game%29">Thief</a>", is a reboot of the "Thief" series; and it does not feature the Hammerites, pagans or Keepers. Its plot follows Garrett (voiced by Romano Orzari in place of Stephen Russell) in the aftermath of an accident that leaves his protégé, Erin, missing. Garrett has amnesia after this incident, and the City is beset by a plague called the Gloom. The game was released for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a> and the <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a>, <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a>, <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a> and <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a> in February 2014.

Soon after the bankruptcy of Looking Glass, a fan group called the Dark Engineering Guild began developing an expansion <a href="Mod%20%28video%20gaming%29">mod</a> to "Thief II", entitled "Thief 2X: Shadows of the Metal Age". Initially, they hoped to fill the void left by the cancellation of "Thief III", but they continued to work on the mod after the announcement and release of "Thief: Deadly Shadows". Released in 2005 after five years in development, the mod follows Zaya, a young woman who is robbed while visiting the City and who then seeks revenge. She is mentored by a pagan hermit named Malak, who trains her as a thief but who has ulterior motives. The team designed Zaya to be physically capable and to have a "middle-eastern/north-african look", but made an effort to avoid similarities to <a href="Mulan%20%28Disney%20character%29">Mulan</a>. Chronologically, the story starts near the end of "Thief" and ends in the middle of "Thief II", thereby depicting the rise of Gorman Truart and the early days of the Mechanists. "Thief 2X" features 13 missions, with new animated cutscenes and roughly 3,000 new lines of recorded dialogue.

The mod was praised by critics and by the "Thief" fan community. Brett Todd of "<a href="PC%20Gamer%20US">PC Gamer US</a>" awarded it "Mod of the Month" and wrote, "It doesn't quite have the mysterious allure of the original games, but it's awfully close". A writer for <a href="Jolt%20Online%20Gaming">Jolt Online Gaming</a> praised the mod's visuals and considered its missions to be "incredibly well designed". While the writer commented that "Thief 2X" did not perfectly follow the series' tone and that its voice acting was "not the best", they finished by saying that fans of the "Thief" series had "no excuse not to play "T2X"." "PC Gamer UK"s <a href="Kieron%20Gillen">Kieron Gillen</a> wrote that he had expected the mod to be cancelled, given that the "web is full of [...] five-percent finished masterworks from people who aimed far, far too high." After "Thief 2X"s release, he lauded it as the best "Thief" fan work, and as "one of the most impressive achievements of any fan community for any game."

Sacagawea dollar

The Sacagawea dollar (also known as the "golden dollar") is a United States <a href="Dollar%20coin%20%28United%20States%29">dollar coin</a> that has been minted every year since 2000, although not released for general circulation from 2002 to 2008 and again from 2012 onward due to its general unpopularity with the public and low business demand for the coin. These coins have a copper core clad by <a href="manganese%20brass">manganese brass</a>, giving them a distinctive golden color. The coin features an <a href="Obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a> by <a href="Glenna%20Goodacre">Glenna Goodacre</a>. From 2000 to 2008, the reverse featured an eagle design by <a href="Thomas%20D.%20Rogers">Thomas D. Rogers</a>. Since 2009, the reverse of the Sacagawea dollar has been changed yearly, with each design in the series depicting a different aspect of Native American cultures.

The coin was first suggested as a replacement for the <a href="Susan%20B.%20Anthony%20dollar">Susan B. Anthony dollar</a>, which proved useful for vending machine operators and mass transit systems despite being unpopular with the public. The <a href="Statue%20of%20Liberty">Statue of Liberty</a> was originally proposed as the design subject, but <a href="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</a>, the <a href="Shoshone">Shoshone</a> guide of the <a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20Expedition">Lewis and Clark Expedition</a>, was eventually chosen.

The new dollar coin was heavily marketed by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">Mint</a> in a series of print, radio, and television advertisements, as well as Mint partnerships with <a href="Walmart">Walmart</a> and <a href="Cheerios">Cheerios</a>. However, the Sacagawea dollar did not prove popular with the public, and mintage dropped sharply in the second year of production. Production of Sacagawea dollars continued, from 2007 to 2016 in parallel with the U.S. <a href="Presidential%20%241%20Coin%20Program">Presidential dollar</a>s. In 2012, mintage numbers were reduced by over 90%, in line with a similar reduction for the Presidential Dollars, due to large stockpiles of unused dollar coins.

The Mint planned to issue the Sacagawea design in 22-<a href="Carat%20%28purity%29">karat</a> gold as well, but this idea was quickly abandoned after the Mint's authority to strike the coins was questioned, and the Mint has retained ownership of the few such coins produced. Soon after initial production of the dollar, it was noticed that a few of the dollar coins were erroneously struck with the obverse of a <a href="50%20State%20Quarters">state quarter</a> and the normal reverse.

Due to the limited circulation of the cumbersome <a href="Eisenhower%20dollar">Eisenhower dollar</a>, it was decided in the 1970s that a smaller dollar coin might prove more useful to the public. On September 26, 1978, <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> approved legislation to provide for a <a href="Susan%20B.%20Anthony%20dollar">smaller dollar coin</a> to be minted, which would depict <a href="Susan%20B.%20Anthony">Susan B. Anthony</a>, a prominent American <a href="suffragette">suffragette</a>. These new dollars also proved unpopular, due in large part to their similarity in size and metallic composition to the <a href="Quarter%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">quarter-dollar</a>. Since there was little interest in the coin as a circulating medium, most were placed in <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Mint</a> and <a href="Federal%20Reserve%20System">Federal Reserve</a> vaults throughout the country, and mintage ceased after 1981.

Despite their initial lack of popularity, by the late 1990s the Treasury's supply of Anthony dollars began to dwindle due to their widespread use in vending machines (including more than 9,000 stamp machines situated in post offices across the United States) and mass transit turnstiles. Beginning in 1997, several bills were introduced to Congress with the intent of resuming mintage of small-sized dollar coins to keep up with demand. On March 20 of that year, Arizona Republican <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Representative</a> <a href="Jim%20Kolbe">Jim Kolbe</a> introduced legislation calling for more dollar coins to be minted. Four months later, on July 24, Republican Representative <a href="Michael%20Castle">Michael Castle</a> of Delaware, a member of the House Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy, also introduced legislation, calling for the <a href="Statue%20of%20Liberty">Statue of Liberty</a> to be the subject of the design. On October 21, Minnesota Republican <a href="Rod%20Grams">Rod Grams</a> introduced a bill in the Senate, also calling for the mintage of a newly designed dollar coin. The final legislation authorizing the design and production of a new dollar coin was based on Grams' bill. Also on October 21, in a hearing before the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy, Trade, and Technology, Treasury Department officials gave their support for a new dollar coin, recommending that it be gold-colored with a distinctive edge, to make it easily distinguishable from the quarter-dollar. During this hearing, <a href="Philip%20N.%20Diehl">Philip N. Diehl</a>, then Director of the Mint, estimated that it would take thirty months to begin production of the new coin.

The United States Senate approved the necessary legislation on November 9, 1997, and the House of Representatives did the same on November 13. On December 1 President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> signed the <a href="50%20State%20Quarters">50 States Commemorative Coin Program Act</a>, which became Public Law 105-124. Section four of the act, which is entitled "United States $1 Coin Act of 1997", provided for a new dollar coin to be struck, stating in part: "The dollar coin shall be golden in color, have a distinctive edge, have tactile and visual features that make the denomination of the coin readily discernible". The act also gave authority to the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</a> to resume production of the Susan B. Anthony dollar until production could begin on the new dollar coin. In total, more than 41 million Susan B. Anthony dollars were struck bearing the date 1999.

Though the United States $1 Coin Act of 1997 required a change in composition and edge, it did not dictate what was to appear on the coin. To determine this, Treasury Secretary <a href="Robert%20Rubin">Robert Rubin</a> appointed a nine-member Dollar Coin Design Advisory Committee. Rubin, who had the authority to select the coin's design as Secretary of the Treasury, specified that the coin should depict a representation of one or more women and could not depict a living person. The committee was chaired by Philip N. Diehl, a role that did not include a vote on the designs. They met in Philadelphia in June 1998, listening to seventeen concepts submitted by members of the public, and reviewing many more suggestions received by telephone, mail and email. On June 9, 1998, the committee recommended <a href="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</a>, the <a href="Shoshone">Shoshone</a> guide of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, for the design of the new coin. Despite the committee's choice of Sacagawea, Castle advocated that the Statue of Liberty be depicted, as per his earlier legislation. In a letter to the House of Representatives, Castle explained his objection, stating that the "goal in creating a new dollar coin is to make it more distinctive with a popular design that would encourage its wider use by the public." Between November 18 and 22, 1998, the <a href="Government%20Accountability%20Office">General Accounting Office</a> conducted a poll on behalf of Castle. The object of the poll was to determine which design the public would find more desirable. In total, 65 percent preferred the Statue of Liberty, 27 percent preferred Sacagawea, two percent believed that either was acceptable, three percent said neither was acceptable, and an additional three percent had no opinion. Despite Castle's objection, Sacagawea was ultimately chosen as the subject of the coin.

Invitations were sent to 23 artists with guidelines as to what their designs should depict. The <a href="Obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a> was to depict a representation of Sacagawea, and the reverse an eagle symbolizing peace and freedom. Another guideline requested artists "be sensitive to cultural authenticity, and try to avoid creating a representation of a classical European face in Native American headdress." In November and December 1998, members of the Native American community, teachers, <a href="Numismatics">numismatist</a>s, historians, members of Congress, various government officials and others were invited by the United States Mint to review the submitted proposed designs. Six obverse and seven reverse designs were originally selected for further consideration.

After the Mint conducted a series of polls and focus groups, three obverse and four reverse designs were selected as finalists. The Mint received approximately 90,000 e-mails in reference to the design selection process. In response to the large amount of feedback generated, Diehl stated that the internet has "allowed us to conduct a public outreach program of unprecedented scope to measure opinions of the designs." All seven of the selected designs were forwarded to the <a href="United%20States%20Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">United States Commission of Fine Arts</a>; the Commission chose an obverse design depicting Sacagawea with her infant son, <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Charbonneau">Jean Baptiste Charbonneau</a>, as designed by sculptor <a href="Glenna%20Goodacre">Glenna Goodacre</a>. Goodacre chose <a href="Randy%27L%20He-dow%20Teton">Randy'L He-dow Teton</a> to model for Sacagawea, of whom there are no known contemporary portraits, to help the artist capture the features of a young Native American woman. The depiction of infant <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Charbonneau">Jean Baptiste Charbonneau</a> was partially modeled after one-year-old Adam Scholz, with assistance from his father, Peter Scholz. The chosen reverse, designed by Mint sculptor-engraver <a href="Thomas%20D.%20Rogers">Thomas D. Rogers</a>, depicted a soaring eagle.

On September 20, 2007, , known as the Native American $1 Coin Act, was signed by president <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a>. The act specified in part that the one dollar coin shall depict "images celebrating the important contributions made by Indian tribes and individual Native Americans to the development of the United States and the history of the United States." The act also called for the removal of the date from the obverse and "" from the reverse of the coin, opting instead to add them to the edge. At this time the <a href="Mint%20mark">mintmark</a> was also moved to the edge.

The program requires that the reverse of the dollar depict a new design every year. In order to determine which design to depict on the coins, officials from the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Indian%20Affairs">United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs</a>, the Native American Caucus and the <a href="National%20Congress%20of%20American%20Indians">National Congress of American Indians</a>, the consulting organizations for the program, appoint a liaison to the United States Mint. Between twelve and fifteen themes are selected after consultation with the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20the%20American%20Indian">National Museum of the American Indian</a> and the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>. At this point, the consulting organizations supply the Mint with written comments regarding the themes. The suggestions are then sent to the <a href="Citizens%20Coinage%20Advisory%20Committee">Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee</a>, where a theme is recommended. After reviewing the recommendations and input from the contributing organizations, the selected theme is finalized, at which point designs are produced that represent the theme. Once designs are created, the consulting organizations and the National Museum of the Native American are consulted, and the designs are sent to the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee for approval. Based on all comments and recommendations received, the Mint selects a final design that is recommended to the Secretary of the Treasury for approval.

The first coin in the Native American series, issued in 2009, was designed by Mint sculptor-engraver Norman E. Nemeth, the subject being the spread of <a href="Three%20Sisters%20%28agriculture%29">Three Sisters Agriculture</a>. It depicts a Native American woman planting seeds in a field populated with corn, beans and squash. Above the woman is the inscription "", and below is "".

The design selected for the 2010 reverse was designed by <a href="Artistic%20Infusion%20Program">Artistic Infusion Program</a> artist Thomas Cleveland and depicts the <a href="Hiawatha%23Hiawatha%20Belt">Hiawatha belt</a> surrounding five stone-tipped arrows, along with the inscriptions "", "", "" and "". The subject of the design is the "Great <a href="Tree%20of%20Peace">Tree of Peace</a>".

The reverse of the 2011 dollar depicts the hands of the Supreme <a href="Sachem">Sachem</a> <a href="Massasoit">Ousamequin</a> and <a href="Plymouth%20Colony">Plymouth Colony</a> Governor <a href="John%20Carver%20%28Mayflower%20passenger%29">John Carver</a> holding a <a href="ceremonial%20pipe">ceremonial pipe</a>, along with the inscriptions "", "", and "". The coin was designed by Artistic Infusion Program artist Richard Masters and engraved by Mint sculptor–engraver <a href="Joseph%20Menna">Joseph Menna</a>. The design subject is treaties with tribal nations.

The theme for the reverse of the 2012 dollar is "Trade Routes of the 17th Century" and the design depicts the profile of a Native American man and a horse in the foreground and a group of galloping horses in the background. This reverse design was created by Thomas Cleveland as part of the Artistic Infusion Program and engraved by Mint sculptor–engraver <a href="Phebe%20Hemphill">Phebe Hemphill</a>.

The 2013 dollar commemorates the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Fort%20Pitt">Treaty with the Lenape</a> in 1778, the first formal treaty between the United States and a Native American tribe. The coin depicts a turkey, a howling wolf, and a turtle—symbols of the <a href="Lenape">Lenape</a>. Its design was created by Susan Gamble as part of the Artistic Infusion Program, and engraved by Phebe Hemphill.

The 2014 dollar depicts a Native American man clasping a <a href="ceremonial%20pipe">ceremonial pipe</a> while his wife holds a plate of provisions, including fish, corn, roots and gourds. In the background is the stylized image of the face of <a href="William%20Clark%20%28explorer%29">William Clark's</a> compass, displaying "NW" for "northwest." It bears the inscriptions "" and "", as required by law.

The reverse design of the 2015 dollar depicts <a href="Mohawk%20people%23Mohawk%20ironworkers%20in%20New%20York">Mohawk ironworkers</a>. According to the U.S. Mint, the coin commemorates <a href="Kahnawake">Kahnawake</a> and <a href="Akwesasne">Akwesasne</a> <a href="Mohawk%20people">Mohawk</a> ironworkers who contributed to the building of New York City <a href="skyscraper">skyscraper</a>s. The inscriptions on the reverse read "", "" and "." It was designed by artist Ronald D. Sanders.

According to an August 29, 2014, U.S. Mint press release, the design selected for use on the 2016 coins commemorates <a href="Code%20talker">Code talker</a>s from World Wars I and II. Designed by Thomas D. Rogers, it includes the inscriptions ", "", "" and "" and depicts two helmets used by American fighting forces in the 20th century — the <a href="Brodie%20helmet">Brodie helmet</a> of World War I, and the <a href="M1%20helmet">M1 helmet</a> of World War II — along with two feathers which combine to form a V, "symbolizing victory, unity, and the important role that these code talkers played."

On October 7, 2015, the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee recommended new designs for 2017 and 2018. These were, respectively, <a href="Sequoyah">Sequoyah</a> and <a href="Jim%20Thorpe">Jim Thorpe</a>.

The 2019 dollar’s theme is “American Indians in the space program”, depicting <a href="Mary%20G.%20Ross">Mary G. Ross</a>.

After her obverse design was approved, Goodacre visited the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> engraving department six times in order to finalize the designs. Rogers' reverse design was also modified before production began. In his original proposal, mountainous scenery was depicted beneath the flying eagle; this was removed and the positions of other reverse design features were altered before Rubin gave final approval. The composition selected for the new coin included a cladding of <a href="Brass">manganese brass</a> (containing about 77% copper, 12% <a href="zinc">zinc</a>, 7% <a href="manganese">manganese</a>, and 4% nickel) over a pure copper core. This composition was chosen because it would give the coin a distinctive golden color while being <a href="Electromagnetism">electromagnetically</a> identical to its predecessor, the <a href="cupronickel">copper-nickel</a> Susan B. Anthony dollar. The first official striking of the Sacagawea dollar took place on November 18, 1999, during a ceremony in which dignitaries and other invited guests each struck individual examples of the coins. Because the coins were struck before 2000, it was not legal to release them during the first strike ceremonies. Instead, the coins were saved and later sent to the dignitaries who struck them. Full-scale production began shortly after the ceremonial strikings.

For her work creating the obverse of the Sacagawea dollar, Goodacre received a $5,000 commission; she requested that it be paid in dollar coins. The 2000-P dollars paid to Goodacre were struck on specially <a href="Burnishing%20%28metal%29">burnished</a> blanks to give them a finish unique to that striking. Diehl and other Mint dignitaries personally delivered the coins to Goodacre on April 5, 2000. A similar specially burnished finish was used on the 75,000 2000-D dollars included in the Millennium Coin & Currency sets. Soon after release of the new coins, it was discovered that they tarnished quickly once in circulation. In April 2001 the Mint began testing an experimental rinse that would inhibit the tarnishing; however, the rinse was used only in that year.

The act authorizing the dollar coin also provided for the Secretary of the Treasury to "adopt a program to promote the use of such coins by commercial enterprises, mass transit authorities, and Federal, State, and local government agencies." The Mint's initial advertising campaign, consisting of an estimated 1,600 television, radio and print advertisements and partnerships with the national retail chain <a href="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a> and the <a href="General%20Mills">General Mills</a> company, cost approximately $41 million. The television ads consisted of the head of George Washington superimposed upon a body, voiced by actor <a href="Michael%20Keaton">Michael Keaton</a>, discussing the merits of the new dollar coin.

Beginning in January 2000, the Mint began sending dollar coins to Wal-Mart and <a href="Sam%27s%20Club">Sam's Club</a> stores across the United States in order to help promote and circulate the coins. In total, $100 million worth of the dollars were shipped to the stores as part of the promotion. Some store owners criticized the Mint's partnership with Wal-Mart and Sam's Club as being unfair to smaller retailers. In response, Diehl noted that "every retailer and commercial establishment has the right to carry the Golden Dollar. The Mint's agreement with Wal-Mart is designed to encourage all retailers and commercial businesses in the nation to use the new Golden Dollar in everyday transactions."

During this time, the Mint began a partnership with the General Mills company, in which 10,000,000 boxes of <a href="Cheerios">Cheerios</a> cereal would contain a 2000-dated <a href="Lincoln%20cent">Lincoln cent</a> as a prize, one in every 2,000 boxes would contain a new Sacagawea dollar and one in every 4,400 would hold a certificate redeemable for 100 Sacagawea dollars. It was later discovered that the dollars included in every 2,000 boxes were in fact early strikes, differing from those ultimately issued for circulation by the number of tail feathers on the eagle. Approximately 5,500 of the coins were included in the boxes of cereal. Far less of these dollars are known, since many may have been spent. Later analysis also showed that an unknown number of them had the normal "Reverse of 2000" rather than what collectors called the enhanced tail feathers "Reverse of 1999". Thus the fact that a coin came from the cereal box does not guarantee that it is the rare variety.

In 1999, the Mint struck a number of Sacagawea dollars in .9167 fine (22-<a href="carat%20%28purity%29">karat</a>) gold. During the initial production of the coins, they were denominated at five dollars in order to help the public distinguish them from their circulating counterparts. The plan was to sell gold versions of the coins to collectors. On March 20, this plan was halted when some Congressmen questioned the authority of Mint officials to strike the coins in a composition different from what had already been authorized. Full-scale coin production never took place even though the Mint maintained that it did have authority to do so, as the coins would be considered numismatic items and not regular-issue coins. Similar gold coins were also struck, this time bearing the denomination of one dollar and a "W" <a href="mint%20mark">mint mark</a>, signifying that the coins were struck at the <a href="West%20Point%20Mint">West Point Mint</a>. In total, 39 such coins were struck, twelve of which were found to be of adequate quality, while the rest were eventually destroyed. Unlike those denominated at five dollars, the one dollar pieces were "struck to commemorate the historic flight of the <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Columbia">Space Shuttle "Columbia"</a> in July 1999", according to Former Mint Director <a href="Edmund%20C.%20Moy">Ed Moy</a>. The twelve surviving gold dollars were sent into space aboard "Columbia" on mission <a href="STS-93">STS-93</a> in July 1999. Following the return of the shuttle, the coins were placed in storage at <a href="Fort%20Knox">Fort Knox</a>, where they remained until 2007, when they were exhibited at the <a href="American%20Numismatic%20Association">American Numismatic Association</a> World's Fair of Money in <a href="Milwaukee">Milwaukee, Wisconsin</a>. After the event, the coins were returned to Fort Knox; however, the Mint is currently planning to loan the coins to various museums throughout the country.

In May 2000, an <a href="Mint-made%20errors">error coin</a> bearing the <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> obverse design of a U.S. <a href="50%20State%20Quarters">state quarter</a> and the eagle reverse of a Sacagawea dollar was discovered in a roll of dollar coins purchased from a bank in <a href="Mountain%20Home%2C%20Arkansas">Mountain Home, Arkansas</a>. The undated coin, known as a <a href="Mule%20%28coin%29">double-denomination mule</a>, was the first of eleven discovered and authenticated. Mint officials estimate that the coins, which bear the 'P' mint mark for <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia</a>, were struck from late April to early May 2000. They were produced on dollar-coin planchets clad with manganese bronze, not quarter planchets with copper-nickel cladding.

Following the initial discovery, a bin containing several thousand of the error coins was impounded at the Philadelphia Mint, and all such coins within it were ordered melted. Some of the coins that had been released were eventually tracked back to a <a href="Coin%20wrapper">coin-wrapping</a> facility near <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. Employees at the wrapping facility were instructed to watch for any of the coins; those discovered were turned over to the Mint.

A subsequent <a href="Federal%20Government%20of%20the%20United%20States">federal</a> investigation into the incident found that the error coins had been struck accidentally, but two former Mint employees were guilty of selling some of the dollars, resulting in imprisonment and fines for both individuals. In 2002, Mint officials announced that two of the ten coins then reported had entered circulation through legal channels, but the other eight were of dubious origins and might be seized. However, as of 2011, the federal government has not attempted to seize the eight examples considered of dubious origin.

As of August 2011, eight of the eleven error coins, including the one initially discovered in Arkansas, are owned by a New Mexico collector who purchased them between 2000 and 2003, paying as high as $75,000 for a single specimen. Of the other three documented mules, one is owned by its discoverer, a Missouri collector, another was purchased by an unnamed collector, and the third, first reported in 2011, was purchased in 2011 by a Chicago dealer from an individual who had owned the coin for about ten years. Sale prices as high as $200,000 have been reported. Three different <a href="die%20%28manufacturing%29">die</a> combinations have been identified among the eleven available error coins.

The coin received mixed reviews from the nation's senators. In an interview with <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> columnist Suzanne Gamboa, Republican Senator Phil Gramm of Texas described United States currency as "crummy". Gramm, who was one of the senators who voted for the bill containing the legislation that authorized it, praised the design of the Sacagawea dollar as being an improvement over the other coin designs then in production. Despite his praise of the design, Gramm condemned the Mint's approach to marketing the coin, stating that if the United States Mint were the <a href="Franklin%20Mint">Franklin Mint</a>, they would be "sued for deceptive advertisement." He also noted his belief that the Mint had repeated the earlier mistakes of the Susan B. Anthony dollar by issuing a coin that was tailored to the requests of the vending machine industry rather than the average consumer. Texas Republican Senator <a href="Kay%20Bailey%20Hutchison">Kay Bailey Hutchison</a> criticized both the Sacagawea design as well the coin's size in relation to the other coins in circulation at the time. Hutchison felt that the new coin lacked the necessary heft to easily distinguish it from the lower denominations, and that the dollar, as well as the other coins and currency then in circulation "looks like play money." Senators <a href="Mike%20DeWine">Mike DeWine</a> of Ohio and <a href="Byron%20Dorgan">Byron Dorgan</a> of North Dakota, Republican and Democrat respectively, praised the design and the distinctiveness of the golden color.

The series proved unpopular in everyday commerce. Mintage dropped by 90% the following year. From 2002 through 2008, Sacagawea dollars were only struck for sale to collectors. The Federal Reserve Bank ordered none of the Native American series after their issuance beginning in 2009. In December 2009, it was noted by a Federal Reserve official that there were currently 857,000,000-dollar coins (including <a href="Presidential%20%241%20Coin%20Program">Presidential dollar</a>s) in government storage vaults, an amount estimated to satisfy the demand for twelve years.

Despite their unpopularity in the United States, the coins have proven popular for commerce in <a href="El%20Salvador">El Salvador</a> and <a href="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>, nations that <a href="Currency%20substitution">use the United States dollar</a>.

Besides the annual proof and uncirculated sets, Sacagawea dollars with special finishes have also been inserted into several mint packages. These include the following:

<doc id="2205026" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2205026" title="Seated Liberty dollar">
Seated Liberty dollar

The Seated Liberty dollar was a <a href="Dollar%20coin%20%28United%20States%29">dollar coin</a> struck by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Mint</a> from 1840 to 1873 and designed by its chief engraver, <a href="Christian%20Gobrecht">Christian Gobrecht</a>. It was the last silver coin of that denomination to be struck before passage of the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201873">Coinage Act of 1873</a>, which temporarily ended production of the silver dollar for American commerce. The coin's <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a> is based on that of the <a href="Gobrecht%20dollar">Gobrecht dollar</a>, which had been minted experimentally from 1836 to 1839. However, the soaring eagle used on the reverse of the Gobrecht dollar was not used; instead, the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Mint</a> (Mint) used a heraldic eagle, based on a design by late Mint Chief Engraver John Reich first utilized on coins in 1807.

Seated Liberty dollars were initially struck only at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a>; in 1846, production began at the <a href="New%20Orleans%20Mint">New Orleans facility</a>. In the late 1840s, the price of silver increased relative to gold because of an increase in supply of the latter caused by the <a href="California%20Gold%20Rush">California Gold Rush</a>; this led to the hoarding, export, and melting of American silver coins. The <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201853">Coinage Act of 1853</a> decreased the weight of all silver coins of five cents or higher, except for the dollar, but also required a supplemental payment from those wishing their bullion struck into dollar coins. As little silver was being presented to the US Mint at the time, production remained low. In the final years of the series, there was more silver produced in the US, and mintages increased.

In 1866, "<a href="In%20God%20We%20Trust">In God We Trust</a>" was added to the dollar following its introduction to United States coinage earlier in the decade. Seated Liberty dollar production was halted by the Coinage Act of 1873, which authorized the <a href="Trade%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">trade dollar</a> for use in foreign commerce. Representatives of silver interests were unhappy when the metal's price dropped again in the mid-1870s; they advocated the resumption of the <a href="free%20silver">free coinage of silver</a> into <a href="legal%20tender">legal tender</a>, and after the passage of the <a href="Bland%E2%80%93Allison%20Act">Bland–Allison Act</a> in 1878, production resumed with the <a href="Morgan%20dollar">Morgan dollar</a>.

The <a href="Mint%20Act%20of%201792">Mint Act of 1792</a> made both gold and silver <a href="legal%20tender">legal tender</a>; specified weights of each was equal to a dollar. The <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Mint</a> struck gold and silver only when depositors supplied metal, which was returned in the form of coin. The fluctuation of market prices for commodities meant that either precious metal would likely be overvalued in terms of the other, leading to hoarding and melting; in the decades after 1792, it was usually silver coins which met that fate. In 1806, President <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> officially ordered all silver dollar mintage halted, though production had not occurred since 1804. This was done in part to prevent the coins from being exported to foreign nations for melting, causing a strain on the fledgling Mint for little gain. Over the next quarter century, the silver coin usually struck for bullion depositors was the <a href="Half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">half dollar</a>. In 1831, <a href="Director%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Mint">Mint Director</a> <a href="Samuel%20Moore%20%28congressman%29">Samuel Moore</a> requested that President <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> lift the restriction against dollar coin production; the president obliged in April of that year. Despite the approval to strike the coins, no silver dollars were minted until 1836.

The Bureau of the Mint in the 1830s was undergoing a period of significant change, as new technologies were adopted. In 1828, the Mint, whose authorization had been subject to periodic renewal by Congress since its inception in 1792, was given permanent status. A new building to house the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> was authorized by Congress, and opened in 1832. Congress adjusted the precious-metal content of US coins in 1834 and 1837, and was able to achieve a balance whereby US coins remained in circulation alongside those of foreign nations (mostly <a href="Spanish%20milled%20dollar">Spanish colonial pieces</a>). In 1836, the first steam machinery was introduced at the Mint; previously coins had been struck by muscle power. Congress had in 1835 authorized branch mints at <a href="Dahlonega%20Mint">Dahlonega</a> in Georgia, <a href="Charlotte%20Mint">Charlotte</a> in North Carolina, and at <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> in Louisiana. The Charlotte and Dahlonega mints only struck gold, catering to miners in the South who sought to deposit that metal, but the New Orleans facility would also strike silver coins, including the Seated Liberty dollar.

In mid-1835, newly appointed <a href="Director%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Mint">Mint Director</a> <a href="Robert%20Maskell%20Patterson">Robert M. Patterson</a> engaged artists <a href="Titian%20Peale">Titian Peale</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Sully">Thomas Sully</a> to create new designs for American coinage. In an August 1, 1835, letter, Patterson proposed that Sully create an obverse design consisting of Liberty seated on a boulder, holding a "liberty pole" in her right hand topped by a "<a href="pileus%20%28hat%29">pileus</a>", the headgear given by the Romans to an emancipated slave. He also asked Sully to create a reverse design consisting of an "eagle flying, and rising in flight, amidst the constellation irregularly dispersed of twenty-four stars". Patterson requested that the bird appear natural; he criticized the eagle designs then in use on the nation's coinage as being unnatural primarily because of the shield placed on the eagle's breast. Mint Chief Engraver <a href="William%20Kneass">William Kneass</a> prepared a sketch based on Patterson's conception, but suffered a stroke, leaving him partially paralyzed. Later in 1835, <a href="Christian%20Gobrecht">Christian Gobrecht</a> was hired at the Mint as a draftsman, die sinker, and assistant engraver to Kneass. Although nominally a subordinate, Gobrecht would perform much of the engraving work for the Mint until Kneass' death in 1840, when Gobrecht was appointed chief engraver.

Sully prepared sketches of the artwork, which Gobrecht used as a guide in engraving copper plates. The plates were approved by various government officials, and the production of trial strikes began. The design was not free from controversy; former Mint Director Samuel Moore had deprecated the use of the "pileus". Quoting former president <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, Moore had written to Secretary of the Treasury <a href="Levi%20Woodbury">Levi Woodbury</a>, "We are not emancipated slaves."

Following a series of trial strikes and modifications through 1836, the first of what would come to be known as the <a href="Gobrecht%20dollar">Gobrecht dollar</a>s were minted in December of that year. The dollars of 1836 were minted with a silver fineness of .892 (89.2%) silver, a specification set forth in the 1792 act. The mandated fineness of US silver coins was changed from .892 to .900 (90%) by the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201837">Coinage Act of 1837</a>, passed on January 18, 1837; subsequent Gobrecht dollars were struck in .900 silver. Beginning in 1837, an adaptation of the obverse of the Gobrecht dollar, depicting a seated <a href="Liberty%20%28goddess%29">Liberty</a>, was used on the smaller silver coins (from <a href="half%20dime">half dime</a> to <a href="half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">half dollar</a>), with Gobrecht's modification of Reich's heraldic eagle on the reverse of the <a href="quarter%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">quarter</a> and half dollar. Except on the half dime, abolished in 1873, the designs would remain on those coins for over 50 years.

Coinage continued in small amounts until 1839, when official production of the Gobrecht dollar ceased. The coins had been struck as a trial to gauge public acceptance. The Mint acquired a <a href="reducing%20lathe">portrait lathe</a> in 1837, which allowed Gobrecht to work in large models for the later versions of the Gobrecht dollar, and for the Seated Liberty dollar. The lathe, a <a href="pantograph">pantograph</a>-like device, mechanically reduced the design from the model to a coin-size hub, from which working dies could be produced. Prior to 1837, the engraver had to cut the design onto the die face by hand.

Prior to full-scale production of a dollar coin in 1840, Patterson reviewed the designs then in use, including the Gobrecht dollar's. The director opted to replace Gobrecht's soaring eagle reverse with a left-facing <a href="bald%20eagle">bald eagle</a> based on a design by former Mint engraver John Reich, a design first used on silver and gold coinage in 1807. Although the reverse for the dollar was probably selected to match that of the quarter and half dollar, it is not known why the flying eagle design was not used for the lower denominations in the first place. Numismatic historian <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a> speculates that a <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury</a> official might have preferred the Reich design.

The obverse of the Gobrecht dollar was in high relief, but Mint officials felt that this should be lowered for the new coin, which was to be struck in much larger quantities. Patterson hired <a href="Robert%20Ball%20Hughes">Robert Ball Hughes</a>, a Philadelphia artist, to modify the design. As part of Hughes' modifications, Liberty's head was enlarged, the drapery was thickened, and the relief was lowered overall. Thirteen stars were also included on the obverse. On the Gobrecht dollar, with its high relief, the depiction of Liberty appears like a statue on a plinth; the flatter Seated Liberty decreased relief appears more like an engraving.

Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a> tied the appearance of the obverse to <a href="neoclassicism">neoclassicism</a>, noting the resemblance of Gobrecht's Liberty to the marble statues of ancient Rome. The neoclassical school was popular in the first half of the 19th century, and not only among official artists; Vermeule noted, "it becomes almost painfully evident that similar sources were consulted both by the engravers of United States coins in Philadelphia and by the cutters of tombstones from Maine to Illinois". The reverse retained the shield upon the eagle's breast. Art historian Vermeule described it as "the same old unnatural, unartistic eagle with shield on his stomach, like a baseball umpire's protector ... to clutch branch and olives in one foot, arrows of war in the other oversized set of claws". According to numismatic historian David Lange, the Reich-Gobrecht reverse design is known among some coin collectors as the "<a href="sandwich%20board">sandwich-board</a> eagle". Breen, in his comprehensive volume on US coins, complains of "the 'improvements' inflicted by [Hughes] on a hapless Ms. Liberty. Compared with the original Sully-Gobrecht conception of 1836–39, this is a sorry mess indeed."

A small production run of 12,500 was minted in July 1840 to allow bullion depositors to become familiar with the new coins before having their silver struck into dollars. The process of bringing the new coin to public hands was made easier by a congressional authorization in 1837 for a fund that allowed the Mint a "float", permitting it to give depositors payment in coin without waiting for their metal to go through the minting process. Bullion producers began depositing the silver required to initiate heavier production later in 1840; 41,000 pieces were minted in November, followed by a mintage of 7,505 in December. Deposits increased the following year, which saw a mintage of 173,000 pieces. All coins were produced at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> until 1846, when 59,000 were struck at the <a href="New%20Orleans%20Mint">Mint at New Orleans</a>.

Following the <a href="California%20Gold%20Rush">discovery of gold in California</a>, a large amount of gold coins began appearing in American commercial channels. The influx caused the price of gold relative to silver to decrease, making silver coins worth more as bullion than as currency. They were exported abroad, or else melted locally for their bullion value. As it was profitable to export silver, little was presented at the Mint, which resulted in low mintage numbers for the silver dollar; 1,300 and 1,100 were struck in 1851 and 1852 respectively. The rarity of these dates was recognized by the late 1850s; Mint employees made surreptitious restrikes to sell to collectors.

Congress passed the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201853">Coinage Act of 1853</a> in February of that year. The act lowered the silver weight of the coins ranging from the half dime to half dollar by 6.9%, though the dollar remained unaffected. The 1853 act eliminated the practice of depositing silver bullion to be struck into coin, except into the dollar for which a coining charge of .5% was imposed. According to the Senate report filed with the bill which became the Coinage Act, these changes were intended as a temporary expedient, with the <a href="free%20silver">free coinage of silver</a> to be restored when bullion prices became stable. Sources vary in their explanation as to why Congress chose to exempt the dollar from the silver coinage overhaul: <a href="Numismatics">numismatic</a> historian R.W. Julian suggests that it was done due to its status as the "flagship" of American coins. According to <a href="Don%20Taxay">Don Taxay</a> in his history of the Mint and coinage, "the silver dollar, which it [the act] left unchanged to preserve <a href="bimetallism">a bi-metallic currency</a>, continued to be exported and was rarely used in commerce. Without realizing it, the country had entered onto the <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a>." Julian agreed, noting that the act instituted a de facto gold standard in the United States, because it required silver coinage to be paid for in gold. The silver dollar continued to circulate little; quantities were sent west beginning in 1854 to serve as "small change" in California. Silver prices remained high into the 1860s, and little silver bullion was presented for striking into dollars. To serve collectors, individual specimens were made available to the public by the Mint at a cost of $1.08.

Numismatist and coin dealer <a href="Q.%20David%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a> believes that most Seated Liberty dollars produced after 1853 were shipped to China to pay for luxury goods, including tea and silk. R. W. Julian argued to the contrary, that continued production of the dollar had little to do with trade with the Orient (where goods were paid for in silver), suggesting instead that the coins were sent to the West for use there. However, although the Mint's Engraving Department sent dies for the dollar to the San Francisco facility repeatedly from 1858 on, the California mint used them only once before 1870, striking 20,000 dollars in 1859, a year in which 255,700 were struck at Philadelphia and 360,000 at New Orleans. Production at New Orleans was disrupted after 1860 by the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>; it did not strike silver dollars again until 1879, after the end of the Seated Liberty series. After the outbreak of the war in 1861, inflationary <a href="greenback%20%28money%29">greenbacks</a> were introduced, and precious-metal coins vanished from circulation. In April 1863, new Mint Director <a href="James%20Pollock">James Pollock</a> argued that the silver dollar be eliminated, noting in a letter that the coin "no longer enters into our monetary system. The few pieces made are for Asiatic and other foreign trade and are not seen in circulation."

In November 1861, Reverend M. R. Watkinson suggested in a letter that some sort of religious motto should be placed on American coinage to reflect the increasing religiosity of United States citizens following the outbreak of the Civil War. In an October 21, 1863, report to Treasury Secretary <a href="Salmon%20P.%20Chase">Salmon P. Chase</a>, Pollock expressed his own desire to emblazon American coins with a religious motto. The Mint began producing <a href="pattern%20coin">patterns</a> bearing various mottoes, including "God Our Trust" and "In God We Trust"; the latter was ultimately selected, and its first use was on the <a href="Two-cent%20piece%20%28United%20States%29">two-cent piece</a> in 1864.The following year, a law was passed allowing the Treasury to place the motto upon any coin at its discretion. The motto was placed on the silver dollar, as well as various other silver, gold and base metal coins, in 1866.

The coin shortage continued after the end of the Civil War, due largely to the large war debt incurred by the federal government. As a result, silver coinage began to trade at a significant premium to the now ubiquitous greenbacks. Accordingly, the government was reluctant to issue silver coins. Nevertheless, the Mint continued striking silver, to be stored in vaults until such time as they could enter the marketplace. The Seated Liberty dollar was the first coin to be struck at the <a href="Carson%20City%20Mint">Carson City Mint</a>; the first to be issued were 2,303 pieces paid to a Mr. A. Wright on February 11, 1870. The dollar was struck at Carson City from 1870 to 1873, with the largest mintage, 11,758, in 1870. The largest quantity struck at any mint was in 1872 at Philadelphia: 1,105,500, though the mintage in 1871 had also exceeded a million.

Beginning in 1859, large quantities of silver were found in <a href="Nevada%20Territory">Nevada Territory</a> and elsewhere in the American West. In 1869, Director of the Mint <a href="Henry%20Linderman">Henry Linderman</a> began advocating the end of the acceptance of silver bullion deposits to be struck into dollars. Although silver dollars were not coined in large numbers, Linderman saw that mining in the West would increase after the completion of <a href="First%20Transcontinental%20Railroad">the transcontinental railroad</a>, which it did, as US silver production increased from 10 million troy ounces in 1867 to more than 22 million five years later. Linderman foresaw that these activities would increase the supply of silver, causing its price to drop below the $1.2929 per ounce at which the precious metal in the standard silver dollar is worth $1.00. He anticipated that silver suppliers would turn to the Mint to dispose of their product by striking it into dollars. The monetization of that cheap silver, Linderman feared, would inflate the currency and drive gold from commerce because of <a href="Gresham%27s%20law">Gresham's law</a>. Although silver advocates later called <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201873">the resulting law</a> the "Crime of '73" and claimed that it had been passed in a deceitful manner, the bill was discussed during five different sessions of Congress, read in full by both the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senate</a> and printed in full on multiple occasions. Once it passed both houses of Congress, it was signed into law by President <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> on February 12, 1873.

The <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201873">Coinage Act of 1873</a> ended production of the standard silver dollar and authorized creation of the <a href="Trade%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">Trade dollar</a>, thus concluding the Seated Liberty dollar series. The Trade dollar was slightly heavier than the standard dollar and was intended for use in payments in silver to merchants in China. Although not meant for use in the United States, a last-minute <a href="rider%20%28legislation%29">rider</a> gave it legal tender status there up to $5. When silver prices plummeted in the mid-1870s, millions appeared in circulation, at first in the West and then throughout the United States, causing problems in commerce when banks insisted on the $5 legal tender limit. Other abuses followed, such as purchase by companies for bullion value (by then about $0.80) for use in pay packets. Workers had little option but to accept them as dollars. In response to complaints, Congress ended any status as legal tender in 1876, halted production of the Trade dollar (except for collectors) in 1878, and agreed to redeem any which had not been <a href="Seal%20%28East%20Asia%29">chopmarked</a> in 1887.

The 1873 act eliminated the provisions allowing depositors of silver bullion to have their metal struck into standard silver dollars; they could now only receive Trade dollars, which were not legal tender beyond $5. As the price of silver then was about $1.30 per ounce, there was no outcry from silver producers. Beginning in 1874, however, the price dropped; silver would not again sell for $1.2929 or more on the open market in the United States until 1963. Advocates of silver both sought a market for the commodity and believed that "<a href="free%20silver">free silver</a>" or <a href="bimetallism">bimetallism</a> would boost the economy and make it easy for farmers to repay debts. Many in Congress agreed, and the first battle over the issue resulted in a partial victory for silver forces, as the 1878 <a href="Bland%E2%80%93Allison%20Act">Bland–Allison Act</a> required the Mint to purchase large quantities of silver on the open market and strike the bullion into dollar coins. The Mint did so, using a new design by Assistant Engraver <a href="George%20T.%20Morgan">George T. Morgan</a>, which came to be known as the <a href="Morgan%20dollar">Morgan dollar</a>. The issue of what <a href="monetary%20standard">monetary standard</a> would be used occupied the nation for the rest of the 19th century, becoming most acute in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201896">the 1896 presidential election</a>. In that election, the unsuccessful Democratic candidate, <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a>, <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan%20presidential%20campaign%2C%201896">campaigned on "free silver"</a>, having electrified <a href="1896%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">the Democratic National Convention</a> with his <a href="Cross%20of%20Gold%20speech">Cross of Gold speech</a>, decrying the gold standard. The issue was settled for the time by the <a href="Gold%20Standard%20Act">Gold Standard Act</a> of 1900, making that standard the law of the land.

Considerable private melting in the early years of the series makes many dates rare; more melting took place when large quantities that had accumulated at the New York Sub-Treasury were sent to Philadelphia in 1861 and 1862 for restriking into smaller denominations. <a href="Richard%20S.%20Yeoman">R. S. Yeoman</a>'s 2014 edition of "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>" lists no Seated Liberty dollar in collectable condition (<a href="Mint%20state">very good</a> or better) at less than $280.

The key dates of the series include the 1866 variety which lacks the motto "In God We Trust", of which only two are known; one sold at auction in 2005 for $1,207,500. Another rarity is the 1870 struck at San Francisco (1870-S), of which the mintage is not known as their striking was not recorded in that mint's records. Those records indicate that in May 1870, the San Francisco Mint returned two dollar reverse dies to Philadelphia as mistakenly sent without mint mark, and received two proper replacements. There is no record of any 1870-dated obverse dies for the dollar being sent to San Francisco; nevertheless, the coins exist. Breen, writing in 1988, lists twelve examples known, which he speculates may have been presentation pieces, meant to be inserted in a cornerstone. One sold at auction for $1,092,500 in 2003. A similar mystery attends the 1873-S, which despite the stated mintage of 700, is not known to exist. Two of the pieces were routinely sent to Philadelphia for examination at the 1874 meeting of the <a href="United%20States%20Assay%20Commission">United States Assay Commission</a>, but apparently were not preserved. Breen suggests that the remaining mintage may have been melted along with obsolete silver coins.

Elgin Cathedral

Elgin Cathedral is a historic ruin in <a href="Elgin%2C%20Moray">Elgin, Moray</a>, north-east <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>. The cathedral—dedicated to the <a href="Holy%20Trinity">Holy Trinity</a>—was established in 1224 on land granted by King <a href="Alexander%20II%20of%20Scotland">Alexander II</a> outside the <a href="burgh">burgh</a> of Elgin and close to the <a href="River%20Lossie">River Lossie</a>. It replaced the cathedral at <a href="Spynie%20Palace">Spynie</a>, to the north, that was served by a small <a href="chapter%20%28religion%29">chapter</a> of eight clerics. The new and bigger cathedral was staffed with 18 <a href="canon%20%28priest%29">canons</a> in 1226 and then increased to 23 by 1242. After a damaging fire in 1270, a rebuilding programme greatly enlarged the building. It was unaffected by the <a href="Wars%20of%20Scottish%20Independence">Wars of Scottish Independence</a> but again suffered extensive fire damage in 1390 following an attack by <a href="Robert%20III%20of%20Scotland">Robert III</a>'s brother <a href="Alexander%20Stewart%2C%20Earl%20of%20Buchan">Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan</a>, also known as the Wolf of <a href="Badenoch">Badenoch</a>. In 1402 the cathedral precinct again suffered an incendiary attack by the followers of the <a href="Lord%20of%20the%20Isles">Lord of the Isles</a>. The number of clerics required to staff the cathedral continued to grow, as did the number of craftsmen needed to maintain the buildings and surrounds.

The cathedral went through periods of enlargement and renovation following the fires of 1270 and 1390 that included the doubling in length of the choir, the provision of outer aisles to the northern and southern walls of both the nave and choir. Today, these walls are at full height in places and at foundation level in others yet the overall cruciform shape is still discernible. A mostly intact octagonal <a href="chapter%20house">chapter house</a> dates from the major enlargement after the fire of 1270. The gable wall above the double door entrance that links the west towers is nearly complete and was rebuilt following the fire of 1390. It accommodates a large window opening that now only contains stub tracery work and fragments of a large rose window. Recessed and chest tombs in both transepts and in the south aisle of the choir contain effigies of bishops and knights, and large flat slabs in the now grass-covered floor of the cathedral mark the positions of early graves. The homes of the dignitaries and canons, or <a href="manse">manse</a>s, stood in the chanonry and were destroyed by fire on three occasions: in 1270, 1390 and 1402. The two towers of the west front are mostly complete and were part of the first phase of construction. Only the <a href="precentor">precentor</a>'s manse is substantially intact; two others have been incorporated into private buildings. A protective wall of massive proportions surrounded the cathedral precinct, but only a small section has survived. The wall had four access gates, one of which—the Pans Port—still exists.

The number of canons had increased to 25 by the time of the <a href="Scottish%20Reformation">Scottish Reformation</a> in 1560, when the cathedral was abandoned and its services transferred to Elgin's parish church of St Giles. After the removal of the lead waterproofing of the roof in 1567, the cathedral fell steadily into decay. The building was still largely intact in 1615 but in the winter of 1637, a storm brought down the roof covering the eastern limb. In the spring of 1711, the central steeple above the crossing collapsed taking the walls of the nave with it. Ownership was transferred from the Church to the Crown in 1689 but that made no difference to the building's continuing deterioration. Only in the early years of the 19th Century did the Crown begin the conservation process—the stabilisation of the structure proceeded through until the end of the 20th Century with the large scale improvements to the two western towers.

The <a href="Diocese%20of%20Moray">Diocese of Moray</a> was a regional <a href="Diocese">bishopric</a> unlike the pre-eminent see of the Scottish church, <a href="Archdiocese%20of%20St%20Andrews">St Andrews</a>, which had evolved from a more ancient monastic <a href="Celtic%20Christianity">Celtic church</a> and administered scattered localities. It is uncertain whether there were <a href="Bishop%20of%20Moray">bishops of Moray</a> before c. 1120 but the first known prelate—possibly later translated to <a href="Diocese%20of%20Dunkeld">Dunkeld</a>—was <a href="Gregoir%20of%20Moray">Gregory</a> (or Giric, in Gaelic) and was probably bishop in name only. Gregory was a signatory to the foundation charter of <a href="Scone%20Abbey">Scone Priory</a>, issued by <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Scotland">Alexander I</a> ("Alaxandair mac Maíl Choluim") between December 1123 and April 1124, and again in a charter defining the legal rights of the same monastery. He is recorded for the last time when he witnessed a charter granted by David I to <a href="Dunfermline%20Abbey">Dunfermline Abbey</a> in c. 1128. These actions are all that is known of Gregory with no basis for later assertions that he was a promoted monk in a 'Pictish Church'. After the suppression of <a href="%C3%93engus%20of%20Moray">Óengus of Moray</a>'s rebellion in 1130, King David must have regarded the continued existence of a bishopric in Moray as essential to the stability of the province. Yet the next bishop was the absentee titular bishop William (1152–1162), King David's chaplain who had probably been an aid since 1136 and had likely done little to improve the stability of the see by the time he died in 1162. Felix was the next bishop and is thought to have been prelate from 1166 to 1171 although no accurate dates are known—details of his tenure are almost unknown with only one appearance as a witness in a charter of <a href="William%20the%20Lion">William the Lion</a> at his court held in Elgin. Following Felix's death, Simon de Toeni, King William's kinsman and a former abbot of Coggeshall, in Essex became the next bishop. Bishop Simon was the first of the early bishops to adopt a hands-on attitude towards his diocese and was said to be buried in <a href="Birnie%20Kirk">Birnie Kirk</a>, near Elgin, after his death on 17 September 1184 although this suggestion first appeared in 18th-century. He was followed by Richard of Lincoln, once again a royal clerk, and one who struggled to build up the revenues of the bishopric during and after the insurgence of Domnall mac Uilleim (Donald MacWilliam). Richard is regarded as the first resident bishop of the see.

These early bishops had no settled location for their cathedral, and sited it successively at the churches of <a href="Birnie%20Kirk">Birnie</a>, <a href="Kinneddar%20Castle">Kinneddar</a> and Spynie. <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20III">Pope Innocent III</a> issued an <a href="papal%20bull">apostolic bull</a> on 7 April 1206 that allowed bishop <a href="Bricius%20de%20Douglas">Brice de Douglas</a> to fix his cathedral church at Spynie—its inauguration was held between spring 1207 and summer 1208. A chapter of five dignitaries and three ordinary canons was authorised and based its constitution on that of <a href="Lincoln%20Cathedral">Lincoln Cathedral</a>. Elgin became the lay centre of the province under David I, who probably established the first castle in the town, and it may have been this castle, with its promise of better security, that prompted Brice, before July 1216, to petition the Pope to move the seat from Spynie. 

Despite Brice's earlier appeal, it was not until <a href="Andreas%20de%20Moravia">Andrew de Moravia</a>'s episcopate that <a href="Pope%20Honorius%20III">Pope Honorius III</a> issued his bull on 10 April 1224 authorising his legates <a href="Gilbert%20de%20Moravia">Gilbert de Moravia</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Caithness">Bishop of Caithness</a>, Robert, <a href="Abbot%20of%20Kinloss">Abbot of Kinloss</a> and Henry, Dean of Ross to examine the suitability of transferring the <a href="cathedra">cathedra</a> to Elgin. The Bishop of Caithness and the Dean of Ross performed the translation ceremony on 19 July 1224. On 5 July, Alexander II ("Alaxandair mac Uilliam") had agreed to the transference in an edict that referred to his having given the land previously for this purpose. The land-grant predated the Papal mandate and could indicate that work on a new church was already underway before Brice's death but this is thought unlikely and that Bishop Andrew commenced the building works on an unoccupied location.Construction of the cathedral was completed after 1242. Chronicler <a href="John%20of%20Fordun">John of Fordun</a> recorded without explanation that in 1270 the cathedral church and the canons' houses had burned down. The cathedral was rebuilt in a larger and grander style to form the greater part of the structure that is now visible, work that is supposed to have been completed by the outbreak of the <a href="Wars%20of%20Scottish%20Independence">Wars of Scottish Independence</a> in 1296. Although <a href="Edward%20I%20of%20England">Edward I of England</a> took an army to Elgin in 1296 and again in 1303, the cathedral was left unscathed, as it was by his grandson <a href="Edward%20III%20of%20England">Edward III</a> during his assault on Moray in 1336.

Soon after his election to the see in 1362–63, Bishop Alexander Bur requested funds from <a href="Pope%20Urban%20V">Pope Urban V</a> for repairs to the cathedral, citing neglect and hostile attacks. In August 1370 Bur began protection payments to <a href="Alexander%20Stewart%2C%20Earl%20of%20Buchan">Alexander Stewart, Lord of Badenoch</a>, known as the Wolf of <a href="Badenoch">Badenoch</a>, who became Earl of Buchan in 1380, and who was son of the future <a href="Robert%20II%20of%20Scotland">King Robert II</a>. Numerous disputes between Bur and Buchan culminated in Buchan's <a href="excommunication">excommunication</a> in February 1390 and the bishop turning to <a href="Thomas%20Dunbar%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Moray">Thomas Dunbar</a>, son of the Earl of Moray, to provide the protection service. These acts by the bishop, and any frustration Buchan may have felt about the reappointment of his brother <a href="Robert%20Stewart%2C%20Earl%20of%20Fife">Robert Stewart, Earl of Fife</a> as guardian of Scotland, may have caused him to react defiantly: in May, he descended from his island castle on <a href="Lochindorb">Lochindorb</a> and burned the town of <a href="Forres">Forres</a>, followed in June by the burning of Elgin and the cathedral with its manses. It is believed that he also burned <a href="Pluscarden%20Abbey">Pluscarden Priory</a> at this time, which was officially under the Bishop's protection. Bur wrote to Robert III seeking reparation for his brother's actions in a letter stating: <br> Robert III granted Bur an annuity of £20 for the period of the bishop's lifetime, and the Pope provided income from the Scottish Church during the following decade. In 1400, Bur wrote to the <a href="Abbot%20of%20Arbroath">Abbot of Arbroath</a> complaining that the abbot's <a href="prebendary">prebendary</a> churches in the Moray diocese had not paid their dues towards the cathedral restoration. In the same year Bur wrote to the rector of Aberchirder church, telling him that he now owed three years' arrears of the subsidy that had been imposed on non-prebendary churches in 1397. Again, on 3 July 1402, the burgh and cathedral precinct were attacked, this time by Alexander of Lochaber, brother of <a href="Domhnall%20of%20Islay%2C%20Lord%20of%20the%20Isles">Domhnall of Islay, Lord of the Isles</a>; he spared the cathedral but burned the manses. For this act, Lochaber and his captains were excommunicated, prompting Lochaber's return in September to give reparation and gain absolution. In 1408, the money saved during an ecclesiastic vacancy was diverted to the rebuilding process and in 1413 a grant from the customs of Inverness was provided. Increasingly, the appropriation of the parish church revenues led in many cases to churches becoming dilapidated and unable to attract educated priests. By the later Middle Ages, the standard of pastoral care outside the main burghs had significantly declined.

Bishop John Innes (1407–14) contributed greatly to the rebuilding of the cathedral, as evidenced by the inscription on his tomb praising his efforts. When he died, the chapter met secretly—""in quadam camera secreta in campanili ecclesie Moraviensis""—and agreed that should one of their number be elected to the see, the bishop would grant one-third of the income of the bishopric annually until the rebuilding was finished. The major alterations to the west front were completed before 1435 and contain the arms of Bishop <a href="Columba%20de%20Dunbar">Columba de Dunbar</a> (1422–35), and it is presumed that both the north and south aisles of the choir were finished before 1460, as the south aisle contains the tomb of John de Winchester (1435–60). Probably the last important rebuilding feature was the major restructuring of the chapterhouse between 1482 and 1501, which contains the arms of Bishop Andrew Stewart.

The dignitaries and canons constituted the chapter and had the primary role of aiding the bishop in the governance of the diocese. Often the bishop was the titular head of the chapter only and was excluded from its decision-making processes, the chapter being led by the dean as its superior. As the diocese of Moray based its constitution on that of Lincoln Cathedral, the bishop was allowed to participate within the chapter but only as an ordinary canon. Moray was not unique in this: the bishops of <a href="Bishop%20of%20Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Brechin">Brechin</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Caithness">Caithness</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Orkney">Orkney</a> and <a href="Bishop%20of%20Ross%20%28Scotland%29">Ross</a> were also canons in their own chapters. Each morning, the canons held a meeting in the chapterhouse where a chapter from the canonical rulebook of <a href="Benedict%20of%20Nursia">St Benedict</a> was read before the business of the day was discussed.

Bishop Brice's chapter of eight clerics consisted of the dean, precentor, treasurer, chancellor, archdeacon and three ordinary canons. His successor, Bishop Andrew de Moravia, greatly expanded the chapter to cater for the much-enlarged establishment by creating two additional hierarchical posts (<a href="succentor">succentor</a> and subdean) and added 16 more <a href="Prebendary">prebendary canons</a>. In total, 23 prebendaries had been created by the time of Andrew's death, and a further two were added just before the <a href="Scottish%20Reformation">Scottish Reformation</a>. Prebendary churches were at the bestowal of the bishop as the churches either were within the diocesan lands or had been granted to the bishop by a landowner as patronage. In the case of Elgin Cathedral, the de Moravia family, of which Bishop Andrew was a member, is noted as having the patronage of many churches given as prebends.

<a href="Rural%20Dean">Rural Dean</a>s, or "deans of Christianity" as they were known in the Scottish Church, supervised the priests in the deaneries and implemented the bishop's edicts. There were four deaneries in the Moray diocese—Elgin, Inverness, Strathspey and Strathbogie, and these provided the income not only for the cathedral and chapter but also for other religious houses within and outside the diocese. Many churches were allocated to support designated canons, and a small number were held in common. The bishop received <a href="mensa%20%28ecclesiastical%29">mensal</a> and prebendary income in his separate positions as prelate and canon.

The government of the diocese affecting both clergy and laity was vested entirely in the bishop, who appointed officers to the ecclesiastical, criminal and civil courts. The bishop, assisted by his chapter, produced the church laws and regulations for the bishopric and these were enforced at occasional diocesan synods by the bishop or, in his absence, by the dean. Appointed officials adjudicated at <a href="consistory%20court">consistory court</a>s looking at matters affecting <a href="tithes">tithes</a>, marriages, divorces, widows, orphans, wills and other related legal matters. In Moray, these courts were held in Elgin and Inverness. By 1452 the Bishop of Moray held all his lands in one <a href="regality">regality</a> and had Courts of Regality presided over by <a href="Bailiffs">Bailiffs</a> and Deputies to ensure the payment of revenues from his estates.

Large cathedrals such as Elgin had many chapel altars requiring canons, assisted by a plentiful number of chaplains and vicars, to perform daily services. Bishop Andrew allowed for the canons to be aided by seventeen vicars made up of seven priests, five deacons and five sub-deacons—later the number of vicars was increased to twenty-five. In 1350 the vicars at Elgin could not live on their stipends and Bishop <a href="John%20de%20Pilmuir">John of Pilmuir</a> provided them with the income from two churches and the patronage of another from <a href="Thomas%20Randolph%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Moray">Thomas Randolph, second Earl of Moray</a>. By 1489 one vicar had a stipend of 12 <a href="Mark%20%28money%29">marks</a>; six others, 10 marks; one, eight marks; three, seven marks, and six received five marks; each vicar was employed directly by a canon who was required to provide four months' notice in the event of his employment being terminated. The vicars were of two kinds: the vicars-choral who worked chiefly in the choir taking the main services and the chantry chaplains who performed services at the individual foundation altars though there was some overlapping of duties. Although the chapter followed the constitution of Lincoln, the form of divine service copied that of <a href="Salisbury%20Cathedral">Salisbury Cathedral</a>. It is recorded that Elgin's vicars-choral were subject to disciplinary correction for shortcomings in the performance of the services, resulting in fines. More serious offences could end in <a href="corporal%20punishment">corporal punishment</a>, which was administered in the chapterhouse by the sub-dean and witnessed by the chapter. King Alexander II founded a chaplaincy for the soul of <a href="Duncan%20I%20of%20Scotland">King Duncan I</a> who died in battle with <a href="Macbeth%20of%20Scotland">Macbeth</a> near Elgin. The chapel most frequently referenced in records was <a href="Thomas%20Becket">St Thomas the Martyr</a>, located in the north transept and supported by five chaplains. Other chaplaincies mentioned are those of the Holy Rood, St Catherine, St Duthac, St Lawrence, St Mary Magdalene, St Mary the Virgin and St Michael. By the time of Bishop Bur's episcopate (1362–1397), the cathedral had 15 canons (excluding dignitaries), 22 vicars-choral and about the same number of chaplains.

Despite these numbers, not all the clergy were regularly present at the services in Elgin Cathedral. Absence was an enduring fact of life in all cathedrals in a period when careerist clerics would accept positions in other cathedrals. This is not to say that the time spent away from the chanonry was without permission, as some canons were appointed to be always present while others were allowed to attend on a part-time basis. The dean of Elgin was permanently in attendance; the precentor, chancellor, and treasurer, were available for half the year. The non-permanent canons had to attend continuously for three months. The chapter decided in 1240 to penalise persistently absent canons who broke the terms of their attendance by removing one-seventh of their income. In the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Aberdeen">Diocese of Aberdeen</a> and it is assumed in other bishoprics also, when important decisions of the chapter had to be taken, an absentee canon had to appoint a procurator to act on his behalf—this was usually one of the dignitaries who had a higher likelihood of being present. At Elgin in 1488, many canons were not abiding by the terms of their leave of absence, resulting in each of them receiving a formal warning and a summons; despite this, ten canons refused to attend and had a seventh of their prebendary income deducted. The bulk of the workload fell to the vicars and a smaller number of permanent canons who were responsible for celebrating high mass and for leading and arranging sermons and feast day processions. Seven services were held daily, most of which were solely for the clergy and took place behind the rood screen which separated the high altar and choir from lay worshipers. Only cathedrals, collegiate churches and large burgh churches were resourced to perform the more elaborate services; the services in the parish churches were more basic.

The clergy were augmented by an unknown number of lay lawyers and clerks as well as masons, carpenters, glaziers, plumbers, and gardeners. Master Gregory the mason and Master Richard the glazier are mentioned in the chartulary of the cathedral. 

The chanonry, referred to in the cathedral's chartulary as the "college of the chanonry" or simply as the "college", was the collection of the canons' manses that were grouped around the cathedral. A substantial wall, over high, thick and around in length, enclosed the cathedral and manses and separated the church community from the laity; only the manse of Rhynie lay outside the west wall. The houses of 17 vicars and the many chaplains were also situated outside the west wall. The wall had four gates: the West Port gave access to the burgh, the North Port provided access to the road to the bishop's palace of Spynie, the South Port opened opposite the hospital of Maison Dieu and the surviving East or Panns Port allowed access to the meadowland called "Le Pannis". The Panns Port illustrates the portcullis defences of the gate-houses (Fig. 1). Each canon or dignitary was responsible for providing his own manse and was built to reflect his status within the chapter. The castle having become unsuitable, Edward I of England stayed at the manse of <a href="Duffus">Duffus</a> on 10 and 11 September 1303 as did <a href="James%20II%20of%20Scotland">James II</a> in 1455. In 1489, a century after the incendiary attack on the cathedral and precinct in 1390 and 1402, the cathedral records revealed a chanonry still lacking many of its manses. 
The chapter ordered that 13 canons, including the succentor and the archdeacon, should immediately "erect, construct, build, and duly repair their manses, and the enclosures of their gardens within the college of Moray". The manse of the precentor, erroneously called the "Bishop's House", is partially ruined and is dated 1557. (Fig. 2) Vestiges of the Dean's Manse and the Archdeacon's Manse (Fig. 3) are now part of private buildings.

The hospital of Maison Dieu (the Alms House), dedicated to <a href="Mary%20%28mother%20of%20Jesus%29">St Mary</a> and situated near the cathedral precinct but outside the chanonry, was established by Bishop Andreas before 1237 for the aid of the poor. It suffered fire damage in 1390 and again in 1445. The cathedral clerks received it as a secular benefice but in later years it may, in common with other hospitals, have become dilapidated through a lack of patronage. Bishop James Hepburn granted it to the Blackfriars of Elgin on 17 November 1520, perhaps in an effort to preserve its existence. The property was taken into the ownership of <a href="the%20Crown">the Crown</a> after the Reformation and in 1595 was granted to the burgh by <a href="James%20VI%20of%20Scotland">James VI</a> for educational purposes and for helping the poor. In 1624, an almshouse was constructed to replace the original building, but in 1750 a storm substantially damaged its relatively intact ruins. The remnants of the original building were finally demolished during a 19th-century redevelopment of the area.

There were two friaries in the burgh. The <a href="Dominican%20Order">Dominican</a> <a href="Black%20Friars">Black Friars</a> friary was founded in the western part of the burgh around 1233. The <a href="Franciscan">Franciscan</a> (Friars Minor Conventual) <a href="Grey%20Friars">Grey Friars</a> friary was later founded in the eastern part of the burgh sometime before 1281. It is thought that this latter Grey Friars foundation did not long survive, but was followed between 1479 and 1513 by the foundation of a friary near Elgin Cathedral by the Franciscan (Observants) Grey Friars. The building was transferred into the ownership of the burgh around 1559 and later became the Court of Justice in 1563. In 1489, the chapter founded a school that was not purely a song school for the cathedral but was also to be available to provide an education in music and reading for some children of Elgin.
In August 1560, parliament assembled in Edinburgh and legislated that the Scottish church would be Protestant, the Pope would have no authority and that the Catholic mass was illegal. Scottish cathedrals now survived only if they were used as parish churches and as Elgin had been fully served by the Kirk of St Giles, its cathedral was abandoned. An act of parliament passed on 14 February 1567 authorised <a href="Regent">Regent</a> <a href="James%20Stewart%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Moray">Lord James Stewart's</a> <a href="Privy%20Council">Privy Council</a> to order the removal of the <a href="lead">lead</a> from the roofs of both Elgin and <a href="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> cathedrals, to be sold for the upkeep of his army, but the overladen ship that was intended to take the cargo to Holland capsized and sank in Aberdeen harbour. In 1615, <a href="John%20Taylor%20%28poet%29">John Taylor</a>, the 'Water Poet', described Elgin Cathedral as "a faire and beautiful church with three steeples, the walls of it and the steeples all yet standing; but the roofes, windowes and many marble monuments and tombes of honourable and worthie personages all broken and defaced".

Decay had set in and the roof of the eastern limb collapsed during a gale on 4 December 1637. In 1640 the <a href="General%20Assembly%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20Scotland">General Assembly</a> ordered Gilbert Ross, the minister of St Giles kirk, to remove the rood screen which still partitioned the choir and presbytery from the nave. Ross was assisted in this by the <a href="Lairds">Lairds</a> of Innes and Brodie who chopped it up for firewood. It is believed that the destruction of the great west window was caused by <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a>'s soldiers sometime between 1650 and 1660.

At some point, the cathedral grounds had become the burial ground for Elgin. The town council arranged for the boundary wall to be repaired in 1685 but significantly, the council ordered that the stones from the cathedral should not be used for that purpose. Although the building was becoming increasingly unstable the chapterhouse continued to be used for meetings of the Incorporated Trades from 1671 to 1676 and then again from 1701 to around 1731. No attempt was made to stabilise the structure and on Easter Sunday 1711 the central tower gave way, demolishing the nave. Following this collapse, the "quarrying" of the cathedral's stonework for local projects began. Many artists visited Elgin to sketch the ruins, and it is from their work that the slow but continuing ruination can be observed. By the closing years of the 18th century, travelers to Elgin began to visit the ruin, and pamphlets giving the history of the cathedral were prepared for those early tourists. In 1773 <a href="Samuel%20Johnson">Samuel Johnson</a> recorded, "a paper was put into our hands, which deduced from sufficient authorities the history of this venerable ruin."

Since the abolition of bishops within the Scottish Church in 1689, ownership of the abandoned cathedral fell to the crown, but no attempt to halt the decline of the building took place. Acknowledging the necessity to stabilise the structure, the Elgin Town Council initiated the reconstruction of the perimeter wall in 1809 and cleared debris from the surrounding area in about 1815. The <a href="Lord%20Provost">Lord Provost</a> of Elgin petitioned the <a href="Queen%27s%20and%20Lord%20Treasurer%27s%20Remembrancer">King's Remembrancer</a> for assistance to build a new roof for the chapterhouse and in 1824, £121 was provided to the architect <a href="Robert%20Reid%20%28architect%29">Robert Reid</a> for its construction. Reid was significant in the development of a conservation policy for historical buildings in Scotland and was to become the first Head of the Scottish Office of Works (SOW) in 1827. It was probably during his tenure at the SOW that the supporting buttresses to the choir and transept walls were built.

In 1824 John Shanks, an Elgin shoemaker and an important figure in the conservation of the cathedral, started his work. Sponsored by local gentleman Isaac Forsyth, Shanks cleared the grounds of centuries of rubbish dumping and rubble. Shanks was officially appointed the site's Keeper and Watchman in 1826. Although his work was highly valued at the time and brought the cathedral back into public focus, his unscientific clearance work may have resulted in much valuable evidence of the cathedral's history being lost. He died on 14 April 1841, aged 82. A fortnight later, the Inverness Courier published a commemorative piece on Shanks, calling him the "beadle or cicerone of Elgin Cathedral", and writing: 

Some minor works took place during the remainder of the 19th century and continued into the early 20th century. During the 1930s further maintenance work followed that included a new roof to protect the vaulted ceiling of the south choir aisle. From 1960 onwards the crumbling sandstone blocks were replaced and new windows were fitted in the chapterhouse, which was re-roofed to preserve its vaulted ceiling. From 1988 to 2000, the two western towers were substantially overhauled with a viewing platform provided at the top of the north tower.

The first church was markedly <a href="cruciform">cruciform</a> in shape and smaller than the present floor plan. This early structure had a choir without aisles and more truncated, and a nave with only a single aisle on its north and south sides (Fig. 4). The central tower rose above the crossing between the north and south transepts and may have held bells in its upper storey. The north wall of the choir is the earliest extant structure, dating to the years immediately after the church's 1224 foundation; the <a href="clerestory">clerestory</a> windows on top of it are from the later post-1270 reconstruction. This wall has blocked up windows extending to a low level above ground, indicating that it was an external wall and proving that the eastern limb then had no aisle (Fig. 5).

The south transept's southern wall is nearly complete, displaying the fine workmanship of the first phase. It shows the Gothic pointed arch style in the windows that first appeared in France in the mid-12th century and was apparent in England around 1170, but hardly appeared in Scotland until the early 13th century. It also shows the round early Norman window design that continued to be used in Scotland during the entire Gothic period (Fig. 6). The windows and the <a href="Quoin%20%28architecture%29">quoins</a> are of finely cut <a href="ashlar">ashlar</a> sandstone. A doorway in the south-west portion of the wall has large mouldings and has a pointed oval window placed above it. Adjacent to the doorway are two lancet-arched windows that are topped at the clerestory level with three round-headed windows. The north transept has much less of its structure preserved, but much of what does remain, taken together with a study by John Slezer in 1693, shows that it was similar to the south transept, except that the north transept had no external door and featured a stone turret containing a staircase.

The west front has two 13th century buttressed towers high that were originally topped with wooden spires covered in protective lead. Although the difference between the construction of the base course and the transepts suggests that the towers were not part of the initial design, it is likely that the building process was not so far advanced that the masons could fully integrate the nave and towers into each other (Fig. 7).

After the fire of 1270, a programme of reconstruction was launched, with repairs and a major enlargement. Outer aisles were added to the nave, the eastern wing comprising the choir and presbytery was doubled in length and had aisles provided on its north and south sides, and the octagonal chapterhouse was built off the new north choir aisle (Figs. 8 & 9). The new northern and southern aisles ran the length of the choir, past the first bay of the presbytery, and contained recessed and chest tombs. The south aisle of the choir contained the tomb of bishop John of Winchester, suggesting a completion date for the reconstructed aisle between 1435 and 1460 (Fig. 10). Chapels were added to the new outer aisles of the nave and were partitioned from each other with wooden screens. The first bay at the west end of each of these aisles and adjacent to the western towers did not contain a chapel but instead had an access door for the laity.

In June 1390, Alexander Stewart, Robert III's brother, burned the cathedral, manses and burgh of Elgin. This fire was very destructive, requiring the central tower to be completely rebuilt along with the principal arcades of the nave. The entire western gable between the towers was reconstructed and the main west doorway and chapterhouse were refashioned. The internal stonework of the entrance is late 14th or early 15th century and is intricately carved with branches, vines, acorns and oak leaves. A large pointed arch opening in the gable immediately above the main door contained a series of windows, the uppermost of which was a circular or rose window dating from between 1422 and 1435. Just above it can be seen three coats of arms: on the right is that of the bishopric of Moray, in the middle are the Royal Arms of Scotland, and on the left is the armorial shield of Bishop Columba Dunbar (Fig. 11). The walls of the nave are now very low or even at foundation level, except one section in the south wall which is near its original height. This section has windows that appear to have been built in the 15th-century to replace the 13th-century openings: they may have been constructed following the 1390 attack (Fig. 12). Nothing of the elevated structure of the nave remains, but its appearance can be deduced from the scarring seen where it attached to the eastern walls of the towers. Nothing of the crossing now remains following the collapse of the central tower in 1711. Elgin Cathedral is unique in Scotland in having an English style octagonal chapterhouse and French-influenced double aisles along each side of the nave; in England, only <a href="Chichester%20Cathedral">Chichester Cathedral</a> has similar aisles. The chapterhouse, which had been attached to the choir through a short vaulted vestry, required substantial modifications and was now provided with a vaulted roof supported by a single pillar (Figs. 13 & 14). The chapterhouse measures high at its apex and from wall to opposite wall; it was substantially rebuilt by Bishop Andrew Stewart (1482–1501), whose coat of arms is placed on the central pillar. Bishop Andrew was the half-brother of King James II. The delay in the completion of these repairs until this bishop's episcopacy demonstrates the extent of the damage from the 1390 attack.

In 1847–8 several of the old houses associated with the cathedral on the west side were demolished, and some minor changes were made to the boundary wall. Structural reinforcement of the ruin and some reconstruction work began in the early 20th century, including restoration of the east gable rose window in 1904 and the replacement of the missing form pieces, mullions, and decorative ribs in the window in the north-east wall of the chapterhouse (Fig. 15). By 1913, <a href="repointing">repointing</a> the walls and additional waterproofing of the wall tops were completed. In 1924 the ground level was lowered and the 17th-century tomb of the Earl of Huntly was repositioned. Further repairs and restoration ensued during the 1930s, including the partial dismantling of some 19th century buttressing (Fig. 16), the reconstruction of sections of the nave piers using recovered pieces (Fig. 17), and the addition of external roofing to the vault in the south choir in 1939 (Fig. 18). From 1960 to 2000, masons restored the cathedral's crumbling stonework (Fig. 19) and between 1976 and 1988, the window tracery of the chapterhouse was gradually replaced, and its re-roofing was completed (Fig. 20). Floors, glazing, and a new roof were added to the south-west tower between 1988 and 1998 and comparable restoration work was completed on the north-west tower between 1998 and 2000 (Fig. 21).

Joseph W. Tkach

Joseph W. Tkach (; March 16, 1927 – September 23, 1995) was the appointed successor of <a href="Herbert%20W.%20Armstrong">Herbert W. Armstrong</a>, founder of the <a href="Worldwide%20Church%20of%20God">Worldwide Church of God</a>. Tkach became President and Pastor General of the church upon the death of Armstrong in 1986. Tkach spearheaded a major doctrinal transformation of the Worldwide Church of God, abandoning Armstrong's unconventional doctrines and bringing the church into accord with orthodox <a href="Evangelicalism">evangelical</a> <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>. His son, <a href="Joseph%20Tkach%20Jr.">Joseph Tkach Jr.</a>, continued his work and in 1997 the Worldwide Church of God became a member of the <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Evangelicals">National Association of Evangelicals</a>.

During Tkach's tenure, the changes that he implemented stirred much controversy and significant dissent among those who continued to follow <a href="Armstrongism">Armstrong's theology</a>. The dissenters labeled the changes as heresy and many left to form new church organizations. Within the mainstream Christian community, some have hailed Tkach's reforms, which brought a church from the fringe to orthodoxy, as unprecedented.

He was born March 16, 1927, in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, the youngest of five children and the only son of Vassil and Mary Tkach. The name Tkach is of <a href="Rusyns">Carpatho-Rusyn</a> (<a href="Ukrainians">Ukrainian</a>) origin, but his parents were originally from <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>. The neighborhood where he grew up was composed mainly of blue-collar working people of Russian origin. He graduated from Tilden High School in southwest Chicago. He then served a short term in the U.S. Navy near the end of World War II and afterward returned to his native Chicago. On March 31, 1951, Tkach married Elaine Apostolos; they had three children: Joseph Jr., Tanya, and Jennifer.

Tkach grew up in the <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Russian Orthodox</a> faith, but eventually his family, including his parents, became interested in the <a href="Radio%20Church%20of%20God">Radio Church of God</a> through the radio broadcast of Herbert W. Armstrong, the founder of the church. The Radio Church of God would eventually change its name in 1968 to the Worldwide Church of God (WCG), the church that Tkach would lead. It was a church characterized by the strong influence of its founder and his unique doctrines based on his own interpretation of the <a href="Bible">Bible</a>. Initially, Tkach was the only member of his family who was not interested in listening to the radio broadcasts. However, a purportedly miraculous event was to change him. At the time, Tkach suffered from severe ulcers and was required to stay on a special diet. His wife then suggested that God would heal him if he were to become a minister in Armstrong's church. Although skeptical, he accepted the suggestion of becoming a minister and he found himself cured, never again to suffer from the ulcers. He was baptized by Radio Church of God minister, Dean Blackwell, on March 1, 1957. On June 7, 1961, Blackwell ordained him a <a href="deacon">deacon</a> in the Chicago congregation, and on June 3, 1963, <a href="Roderick%20C.%20Meredith">Roderick C. Meredith</a>, who would eventually lead a breakaway church from the WCG, ordained him as an <a href="Elder%20%28Christianity%29">elder</a>.

In 1966 Tkach moved his family to <a href="Pasadena%2C%20California">Pasadena, California</a>, where he enrolled in classes at <a href="Ambassador%20College">Ambassador College</a>, a state-approved, but not regionally accredited, college that was sponsored by the WCG. In 1974, he was ordained to the rank of preaching elder. Armstrong taught that the Bible endorsed "ranks" in the ministry, and elders could progress up the ladder from local elder to preaching elder to pastor to evangelist. The highest rank, apostle, was reserved for the leader of the church.

In the late 1970s a period of financial and leadership disputes occurred within the church hierarchy, with church treasurer, <a href="Stanley%20Rader">Stanley Rader</a>, at the center of many of the disputes. The gravest incident was the church being placed in financial receivership by the <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20California">Attorney General of California</a>, <a href="George%20Deukmejian">George Deukmejian</a>, an action that was later disallowed in court. Tkach took an active role in the defense of Armstrong, Rader, and the church headquarters' operations. He rallied the WCG membership to take action against the court proceedings. Armstrong recognized his effectiveness and subsequently ordained him to the rank of evangelist on September 27, 1979. See <a href="Evangelists%20of%20the%20Worldwide%20Church%20of%20God">Evangelists of the Worldwide Church of God</a>. In March 1981 Armstrong appointed him to the WCG's advisory council of elders, and eventually, Armstrong named him Director of Church Administration, one of the most prominent administrative positions other than Armstrong himself.

Armstrong had recovered from severe heart problems in the late 1970s, but by the mid-1980s he was experiencing rapidly declining health. By 1985 this was common knowledge among church members as the 93-year-old preacher had not been seen in public for several months. According to "The Worldwide News", the official church newsletter, Armstrong told his advisory council on January 7, 1986, of his decision to appoint Tkach to succeed him in the event of his death. It was also announced by Armstrong in a letter to members of the church. Armstrong died on January 16, 1986, only nine days after naming his successor.

Initially there were few visible changes within the church. Tkach continued Armstrong's tradition of traveling abroad, although his emphasis was more on visiting church members and operations than on Armstrong's agenda of visiting world leaders to attempt to witness to them. The church entered a period of rapid growth during the early years of Tkach's administration. In fact, the membership peaked during his tenure at 126,800 members in 1988. The finances were stable, largely due to the church's teaching that members should <a href="tithe">tithe</a>, giving a tenth of their gross income to the church. The church magazine, "<a href="The%20Plain%20Truth">The Plain Truth</a>", continued to serialize the final and most controversial book by Armstrong, "Mystery of the Ages". Tkach also continued, at least in public, to promote the church's unique doctrines.

Tkach did not have the charismatic personality of his predecessor. Unlike Armstrong, who kept a strong hold of the reins, Tkach delegated many tasks, including the presentation of the church-supported television broadcast, "<a href="The%20World%20Tomorrow%20%28radio%20and%20television%29">The World Tomorrow</a>" and the authoring of articles and booklets produced by the church. Although Tkach was not known as a theologian, and made no claims as such, eventually he was to have profound impact on the theological foundations of the WCG.

The first major change under Tkach's tenure was the WCG's doctrine on healing. Previously the church taught that true believers were healed by faith in God and not by doctors. Tkach asked the church leadership to study the question. Once Tkach was satisfied with the results of the study, he officially softened the church's teaching on the matter, encouraging members to seek proper treatment while retaining faith in God as a healer.

Another officially published doctrinal change was that women in the church would be allowed to wear makeup. In the earliest years of the denomination, Armstrong announced the prohibition of makeup for women. In the 1970s that prohibition was lifted, but in 1981 Armstrong reinstituted the teaching. In 1988 Tkach lifted the ban for good.

The first major sign of dissent occurred in 1989 when a WCG minister, <a href="Gerald%20Flurry">Gerald Flurry</a>, published a manuscript outlining what he and others believed were disturbing trends in the work, including the beginnings of the doctrinal departure from what had been established by Armstrong. Flurry and another minister, John Amos, were <a href="disfellowshipped">disfellowshipped</a> and went on to form the <a href="Philadelphia%20Church%20of%20God">Philadelphia Church of God</a> (PCG). The PCG began an alternative radio program and magazine, and over the next several years a few thousand WCG members left to join the PCG. Despite this, Tkach continued to implement additional changes in thinking including:  the shift in emphasis away from observing world events primarily through the lens of <a href="Prophecy">prophetic interpretation</a>; the removal of the prohibition of <a href="interracial%20marriage">interracial marriage</a>; the allowance of work on the <a href="Sabbath%20in%20Christianity">Sabbath</a>; the acceptance of the <a href="Trinity">trinitarian</a> doctrine; and the acceptance of the validity of other Christian denominations, among many other changes. Older Armstrong publications that supported the church's once unique doctrines were allowed to go out-of-print.

As these reforms were being carried out, questions arose as to whether the decisions were truly made by Tkach himself or by others in the church leadership. The church leadership at that time included Mike Feazell, executive assistant and editorial advisor to Tkach, Greg Albrecht, editor of "The Plain Truth", and <a href="Joseph%20Tkach%2C%20Jr.">Joseph Tkach, Jr.</a>, the son of Joseph W. Tkach, and church administration director. One conspiracy theory stated that the decisions did not come from Tkach himself but from the church leadership. Another stated that the ideas did originate from Tkach but he formed them early in his career, kept them hidden from Armstrong, and only allowed the ideas to come to fruition after Armstrong's death. Feazell claims that the reforms were initially driven by a re-examination of church literature that was mainly spurred by questions posed by church ministers and members. These examinations were done by Tkach and Feazell, but the final decisions and approval of materials for publication were made by Tkach. By 1990, Tkach authorized the formation of a "Doctrinal Manual Group", consisting of thirteen ministers and Ambassador College faculty members with the mission of assuring doctrinal consistency, refinement, and advice to the Pastor General. Tkach reviewed and made the final decisions on all recommendations made by the group.

The church's traditions of following the Sabbath, the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a> holy days, and tithing were initially retained. But some WCG ministers and members continued to express alarm over the doctrinal revisions Tkach had already made, and from time to time some would leave to create dissident branches. They included Tkach's one-time mentor, <a href="Roderick%20C.%20Meredith">Roderick C. Meredith</a>, who formed the <a href="Global%20Church%20of%20God">Global Church of God</a> in 1992. As various breakaway groups were established, additional clusters of church members followed.

The doctrinal changes in the church occurred gradually, but by 1994, most of the concepts of <a href="Armstrongism">Armstrongism</a> had been largely modified or discontinued. However, the major bombshell was dropped during what is now called the Christmas Eve Sermon. Tapes of Tkach's sermon (dated January 7, 1995) were delivered to local congregations for viewing. In this sermon, he publicly declared that the Worldwide Church of God was a <a href="New%20Covenant%20%28theology%29">New Covenant</a> church and, therefore, not bound by the terms of the <a href="Old%20Covenant">Old Covenant</a>. Christian theology defines the Old Covenant as the <a href="613%20commandments">Mosaic Law</a> embodied in the <a href="Torah">Torah</a>. Hence, by making this statement, Tkach officially dropped all doctrines based on Mosaic Law (i.e., the keeping of the Sabbath, the Holy Days, and the <a href="dietary%20laws">dietary laws</a>), making observance of such practices an individual choice. He also dropped the requirement of tithing, declaring that giving as taught in the New Testament was voluntary. The last change had a significant and rather immediate impact on church finances.

These and other major changes brought about major defections among ministers and members, which in turn contributed to a further drop in church revenue. In order to bring the finances in order, major changes in the church infrastructure were implemented. "<a href="The%20World%20Tomorrow%20%28radio%20and%20television%29">The World Tomorrow</a>", which had seen record numbers of viewers in the early years of the Tkach administration, was stopped. "<a href="The%20Plain%20Truth">The Plain Truth</a>" publication runs were reduced. Staff at the church headquarters were laid off. The famous, church-subsidized <a href="Ambassador%20Auditorium">Ambassador Auditorium</a> concert series was canceled and offers were sought for the purchase of the <a href="Ambassador%20College">Ambassador College</a> Pasadena campus.

The Christmas Eve sermon only accelerated the departure of church members. A new branch, the <a href="United%20Church%20of%20God">United Church of God</a>, was created in 1995 by a conference of departing ministers and named Tkach's one-time associate and former "<a href="The%20World%20Tomorrow%20%28radio%20and%20television%29">The World Tomorrow</a>" presenter, David Hulme, as president. It eventually became the largest of the groups to break away from the WCG during this period. Although revenues continued to drop, Tkach remained steadfastly committed to the changes that he had implemented.

On May 12, 1995 Tkach had surgery to remove his gall bladder. Shortly thereafter, he was readmitted to the hospital because of severe intestine and back pain. Surgeons then removed a grapefruit-size tumor from his intestines and discovered he had colon cancer. In a letter to ministers, dated September 6, Tkach announced that he was also diagnosed with bone cancer. He elected not to undertake radiation treatments. As Armstrong had done before him, Tkach named a successor to become pastor general in the event of his death. In that case, it was Tkach's son, Joseph Tkach Jr.

Tkach died on September 23, 1995.

The impact of Tkach’s tenure as the head of the WCG was notable. Church income dropped from a high of over $200 million in 1990 to $50 million by 1996. By then the church could only count 49,000 as members, less than half from its peak. The circulation of "<a href="The%20Plain%20Truth">The Plain Truth</a>", distributed free by subscription and via newsstand distribution around the globe, fell from a peak of 8,000,000 to less than 100,000 before it switched to a paid subscription status. Eventually the magazine was spun off into a separate, independent, evangelical ministry. The number of employees at the church headquarters fell from 1,000 to about 50. <a href="Ambassador%20University">Ambassador University</a>, as the college had become after earning regional accreditation in Texas, ceased operations in 1997 as the church could no longer provide its annual operating subsidy. The Pasadena campus was finally sold in 2004.

In assessing the work of Tkach, there are two points of view. The critics of Tkach, especially those who formed the splinter churches, see Tkach as the key person responsible for the collapse of the WCG. They believe that the changes he brought were a turn against God and say his rejection of Armstrong's unique doctrines were, at best, without biblical foundation.

Tkach’s supporters, including those in the leadership of the WCG, see events differently. The WCG describes Tkach’s tenure as "A Decade of Painful Change" and that the end result of his work was the reconciliation of the church with mainstream Christianity. Ruth Tucker, an evangelical leader and an early supporter of the changes which occurred in the WCG, wrote in an article in "<a href="Christianity%20Today">Christianity Today</a>" that
The "changes"—as they are referred to by insiders—are truly historic. Never before in the history of Christianity has there been such a complete move to orthodox Christianity by an unorthodox fringe church.
Vern Bullough, a secular humanist and senior editor of "<a href="Free%20Inquiry">Free Inquiry</a>", commented on the significance of the changes noting:
The shedding of almost every doctrine the Worldwide Church of God once clung to is a story almost without parallel in American religious history.

After his death, the WCG reiterated its full acceptance of the doctrinal changes implemented by Tkach and published an apology to current and former members of the church for the impact previous doctrines had had on members. As evidence that Tkach's work was instrumental in the move toward mainstream Christianity, the WCG was accepted into the membership of the <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Evangelicals">National Association of Evangelicals</a> within two years of his death.

Indian Head cent

The Indian Head cent, also known as an Indian Head penny, was a <a href="cent%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">one-cent coin</a> ($0.01) produced by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a> from 1859 to 1909. It was designed by <a href="James%20Barton%20Longacre">James Barton Longacre</a>, the Chief Engraver at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a>.

From 1793 to 1857, <a href="Large%20cent%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">the cent</a> was a copper coin about the size of a <a href="half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">half dollar</a>. The <a href="California%20Gold%20Rush">discovery of gold in California</a> caused a large inflation in prices. As gold became more abundant, the price of copper rose. Cent and half-cent manufacture was one of the only profit centers for the Mint and by 1850 the Mint began looking for alternatives. In 1857 the Mint reduced the size of the cent and changed the composition to 12% nickel and 88% copper (<a href="copper-nickel">copper-nickel</a>), issuing a new design, the <a href="Flying%20Eagle%20cent">Flying Eagle cent</a>. The new pieces were identical in diameter to modern cents, though thicker. This was the first use of copper-nickel by the United States. The copper-nickel made them look brighter and they began to be called "White cent" or "Nicks".

In 1858 the Flying Eagle was replaced with the Indian head design. The Flying Eagle design caused production difficulties and the Mint soon looked to replace it. Mint Director <a href="James%20Ross%20Snowden">James Ross Snowden</a> selected the Indian Head design and chose a laurel wreath for the reverse that was replaced in 1860 by an oak wreath with a shield. Cents were hoarded during the economic chaos of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> when the metal nickel was in short supply. As Mint officials saw that privately issued bronze tokens were circulating, they induced Congress to pass the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201864">Coinage Act of 1864</a>, authorizing a slimmer cent of bronze alloy.

In the postwar period, the cent became very popular and was struck in large numbers in most years. An exception was 1877 when a poor economy and little demand for cents created one of the rarest dates in the series. With the advent of coin-operated machines in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, even more cents were produced, reaching 100 million for the first time in 1907. In 1909, the Indian Head cent was replaced by the <a href="Lincoln%20cent">Lincoln cent</a>, designed by <a href="Victor%20D.%20Brenner">Victor D. Brenner</a>.

The half-dollar-sized <a href="large%20cent">large cent</a> was struck from 1793 to 1857. That coin was intended to contain close to a cent's worth of copper, as people expected coins to contain close to their <a href="face%20value">face value</a>s in metal. Nevertheless, because of the constitutional clause making only gold and silver legal tender, the government would not accept copper cents for taxes or other payments. By the early 1850s, fluctuations in the price of copper led the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">Mint of the United States</a> to seek alternatives, including reducing the size of the cent and experimenting with compositions other than pure copper. The result was the <a href="Flying%20Eagle%20cent">Flying Eagle cent</a>, the same diameter as the later <a href="Lincoln%20cent">Lincoln cent</a> but somewhat thicker and heavier, composed of 88% copper and 12% nickel. The Flying Eagle cent was struck in limited numbers as a <a href="pattern%20coin">pattern coin</a> in 1856, then for circulation in 1857 and 1858.

The Flying Eagle cent was issued in exchange for worn <a href="Spanish%20colonial%20real">Spanish colonial silver coins</a>, which until then had circulated widely in the United States. These "small cents" were also issued in exchange for the copper coins they had replaced. By 1858, Mint authorities found the piece unsatisfactory in production. The high points on both sides of the coin (the eagle's head and the wreath) opposed each other, and it was difficult to get the design to be brought out fully in the tough copper-nickel alloy. Mint Engraver <a href="James%20B.%20Longacre">James B. Longacre</a>, designer of the Flying Eagle cent, was instructed to develop alternative designs. He produced one, showing a slimmer eagle, which would not clash as much with the reverse wreath. Although this would have cured the production problem, the design was not liked. Mint Director <a href="James%20Ross%20Snowden">James Ross Snowden</a> suggested a head of <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Columbus</a> as an <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a> design, but Longacre felt the public would not approve of a historic figure on an American coin.
In 1858, the Mint tested new designs for the cent. Between 60 and 100 sets of twelve pattern coins were struck, consisting of the standard Flying Eagle obverse, a "scrawny eagle" pattern, and the Indian Head design, mated with four different wreaths for the reverse. Snowden would make his choice of what design would be struck in 1859 from these patterns; the sets were also sold to collectors. The Indian Head design was apparently prepared by April, as on the twelfth of that month, a Mr. Howard wrote to Snowden that "I have learned that a new pattern piece for the cent has been struck off at the Mint [with] a head resembling that of the <a href="Half%20eagle%23Liberty%20Head%20Design">five dollar piece</a> and on the reverse a shield at the top of the olive and oak wreath", and asking to purchase a specimen. Other <a href="numismatics">numismatists</a> also sought pieces: R. Coulton Davis, a Philadelphia druggist with ties to the Mint, wrote to Snowden in June informing him of a favorable story in a Boston newspaper, and Augustus B. Sage wrote to the Mint Director the same month, asking for a specimen for himself, and one for the newly founded <a href="American%20Numismatic%20Society">American Numismatic Society</a>.

According to <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a>, Snowden most likely chose the combination of the Indian Head and the laurel wreath as it was the lowest <a href="relief">relief</a> of any of the options, and could be expected to strike well. On November 4, 1858, Snowden wrote to Treasury Secretary <a href="Howell%20Cobb">Howell Cobb</a> about the Indian Head design, and two days later wrote to Longacre, informing him that it was approved. Longacre was to prepare the necessary dies for production, which was to begin on January 1, 1859.

Longacre advocated his Indian Head design in an August 21, 1858, letter to Snowden:

By numismatic legend, the facial features of <a href="Liberty%20%28goddess%29">the goddess Liberty</a> on the obverse of the Indian Head cent were based on the features of Longacre's daughter Sarah; the tale runs that she was at the mint one day when she tried on the headdress of one of a number of Native Americans who were visiting, and her father sketched her. However, Sarah Longacre was 30 years old and married in 1858, not 12 as in the tale, and Longacre himself stated that the face was based on a statue of "<a href="Crouching%20Venus">Crouching Venus</a>" in Philadelphia on loan from the Vatican. He did often sketch his elder daughter, and there are resemblances between the depictions of Sarah and the various representations of Liberty on his coins of the 1850s. These tales were apparently extant at the time, as Snowden, writing to Treasury Secretary <a href="Howell%20Cobb">Howell Cobb</a> in November 1858, denied that the coin was based "on any human features in the Longacre family". Lee F. McKenzie, in his 1991 article on Longacre, notes that any artist can be influenced by many things, but calls the story "essentially false".

Regardless of who posed for Longacre, the facial features of the "Indian" are essentially Caucasian, meaning that a Caucasian woman wears the headdress of a Native American man. Longacre had, in 1854, designed the <a href="three-dollar%20piece">three-dollar piece</a> with a female with similar features (also supposedly based on the museum sculpture) but a more fanciful headdress, and adapted that design for the <a href="gold%20dollar">gold dollar</a>. Officials were aware of this artistic license at the time of issue; Snowden, in his November 1858 letter to Cobb, characterizes the two earlier coins as "the artists at the Mint evidently not realizing the absurd incongruity of placing this most masculine attribute of the warrior brave on the head of a woman". Longacre would not be the last to juxtapose the features of a White woman with an Indian headdress reserved for men; <a href="Augustus%20Saint-Gaudens">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</a>, for the <a href="Indian%20Head%20eagle">Indian Head eagle</a> (1907), produced a similar design. Later issues depict more accurate Indians, including <a href="Bela%20Lyon%20Pratt">Bela Lyon Pratt</a>'s <a href="Indian%20Head%20gold%20pieces">Indian Head gold pieces</a> (1908), the <a href="Buffalo%20nickel">Buffalo nickel</a> (1913) by <a href="James%20Earle%20Fraser%20%28sculptor%29">James Earle Fraser</a>, who worked from Native American models, and the <a href="Oregon%20Trail%20Memorial%20half%20dollar">Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar</a> (1926), designed by Fraser and his wife <a href="Laura%20Gardin%20Fraser">Laura</a>.
Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a> had mixed emotions about the Indian Head cent: "Longacre enriched the mythology of American coinage in a pleasant if unpretentious fashion. Given his pattern half-dollar designs of 1859 as a yardstick, he could have done worse." In another comparison, Vermeule suggested, "far from a major creation aesthetically or iconographically, and far less attractive to the eye than the [flying eagle], the Indian head cent was at least to achieve the blessing of popular appeal. The coin became perhaps the most beloved and typically American of any piece great or small in the American series. Great art the coin was not, but it was one of the first products of the United States mints to achieve the common touch."

Production of the Indian Head cent for commerce began at the start of 1859. As issued for circulation, the pieces differ in some particulars from the pattern 1858 cent of similar design; Longacre sharpened some details. The pattern coin had the laurel leaves in the reverse wreath in bunches of five leaves; the issued 1859 cent has them in bunches of six. Cents dated 1858 with the adopted reverse (with six-leaf bunches) are known, were most likely struck in 1859, and are extremely rare.

In 1860, the reverse of the cent was changed to feature an oak wreath and a narrow shield; such reverses are also known on 1859-dated pieces struck as patterns. According to Richard Snow in his guidebook to Flying Eagle and Indian Head cents, this was not due to problems with the "Laurel Wreath" reverse design used in 1859, as full details survive on many extant pieces. <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a>, however, suggested that the feathers and curls on the obverse did not strike as well as they would later, and that "this may account for Snowden's decision to change the design again". David Lange, in his history of the Mint, states that it was to give the coin, quoting Snowden, "more National character". All 1859 cents and some from 1860 have the cutoff of Liberty's bust on the obverse end with a point; most 1860 cents and all later issues have it rounded.

Tens of millions of Flying Eagle cents had been issued in exchange for the old American coppers and small Spanish silver. The Spanish silver was still flowing into the Mint in early 1859 and, at Snowden's urging, Congress on March 3 of that year extended the redemption of these foreign coins, legal tender in the US until 1857, for another two years. Neil Carothers, in his work on small-denomination currency, challenged this decision as unnecessary—deprived of legal tender status, the remaining Spanish silver would have been eliminated through sales to banks for their bullion. Those who brought the old coins to the Mint received cents for them, at first Flying Eagle, and then Indian Head. In the year following the renewal, some forty million Indian Head cents were issued, meaning nearly a hundred million copper-nickel cents had entered commerce since 1857. As the coin did not circulate in the South and West due to prejudice against base-metal money, they choked commerce. No one had to take them; no law made them legal tender. At Snowden's urging Congress in June 1860 ended the exchange. Nevertheless, as Snowden admitted in his annual report that year, there were too many cents in circulation. In October 1860, "The Bankers' Magazine and Statistical Register" reported that there were ten million cents in commerce in New York City above what was needed, and if anyone wished to order in bulk, they could be purchased at a discount.

The surplus of cents was relieved by the economic chaos engendered by the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, which began in 1861. At the end of that year, the banks stopped paying out gold, which thereafter commanded a premium over paper money. These <a href="United%20States%20Note">greenbacks</a>, beginning in the following year, were issued in large quantities by the federal government. Silver vanished from commerce in June 1862, as the price of that metal rose, leaving the cent the sole federal coin that had not entirely vanished from commerce through hoarding. The glut of cents had by then abated, as merchants had stored them away in quantity—one New York City floor collapsed beneath the load. There were other means of making change which passed in the emergency, from <a href="Postage%20stamps%20and%20postal%20history%20of%20the%20United%20States%23Encased%20postage%20stamps">postage stamps</a> to privately issued tokens, but the public demand was for the cent—the Philadelphia Mint struck record numbers, and set aside part of the production to be transmitted to other cities. Nevertheless, by July 1862, the cent, in quantity, could only be purchased at a premium of 4% in paper money in major cities in the East. The copper-nickel pieces were nicknamed "nickels", or "nicks". Presentation of coins in payment carried with it no obligation to make change in the same. Accordingly, with a small quantity of "nicks", a shopper could make purchases with exact change, without receiving such makeshifts as merchants' <a href="gift%20certificate">credit slips</a>, that others might not accept at the stated value.

By 1863, "The Bankers' Magazine" reported that the premium for cents in Philadelphia had risen to 20%. Thereafter, the premium decreased as there was a flood of <a href="Civil%20War%20token">metal tokens</a> issued by merchants, which were widely accepted. Other war expedients, such as <a href="fractional%20currency">fractional currency</a>, lessened the demand for the cent by taking the place of missing silver coinage. Small quantities of cents circulated among them, though many were still hoarded.

Government officials saw that the public readily accepted the merchant tokens. Many of these tokens were made of <a href="bronze">bronze</a>, and when, in 1863, they attempted to restore coins to circulation, the use of bronze coins, which would not contain their face values in metal, was considered. In his annual report submitted October 1, 1863, <a href="Presidency%20of%20Abraham%20Lincoln">Lincoln Administration</a> Mint Director <a href="James%20Pollock">James Pollock</a> noted that "whilst people expect a full value in their gold and silver coins, they merely want the inferior [base metal] money for convenience in making exact payments". He observed that the private cent tokens had sometimes contained as little as a fifth of a cent in metal, yet had still circulated. He proposed that the copper-nickel cent be replaced with a bronze piece of the same size. Pollock also wanted to eliminate nickel as a coinage metal; its hard alloys destroyed dies and machinery. On December 8, Pollock wrote to Treasury Secretary <a href="Salmon%20P.%20Chase">Salmon P. Chase</a>, proposing a bronze cent and <a href="two-cent%20piece%20%28United%20States%29">two-cent piece</a>.
On March 2, 1864, Pollock wrote urgently to Chase, warning him that the Mint was running out of nickel and that demand for cents was at an all-time high. He also informed the Secretary that the <a href="United%20States%20Assay%20Commission">United States Assay Commission</a>, composed of citizens and officials who had met the previous month to test the nation's silver and gold coinage, had recommended the use of French bronze (95% copper with the remainder tin and zinc) as a coinage metal for the cent and a new two-cent piece. Three days later, Chase sent Pollock's December letter and draft legislation for bronze one- and two-cent pieces to Maine Senator <a href="William%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BP.%20Fessenden">William P. Fessenden</a>, chairman of the <a href="Senate%20Finance%20Committee">Senate Finance Committee</a>. Fessenden took no immediate action, and on March 16, Pollock wrote again to Chase, warning that the Mint was going to run out of nickel, much of which was imported. Chase forwarded his letter to Fessenden. Legislation was finally introduced by New Hampshire Senator <a href="Daniel%20Clark%20%28New%20Hampshire%29">Daniel Clark</a> on March 22; Pollock's letters were read and apparently influenced proceedings as the Senate passed the bill without debate.

The domestic supply of nickel was at that time produced by a mine at <a href="Gap%2C%20Pennsylvania">Gap, Pennsylvania</a>, owned by industrialist <a href="Joseph%20Wharton">Joseph Wharton</a>. On March 19, Pollock wrote to Chase that they had no more nickel, nor was any available from overseas; "we are thus shut up to the home supply; from the works of Mr. Wharton". Opposed to the removal of nickel from the cent, Wharton published a pamphlet in April 1864 proposing coinage of one-, two-, three-, five-, and ten-cent pieces of an alloy of one part nickel to three of copper, doubling the percentage of nickel used in the cent. Despite Wharton's efforts, on April 20, a select committee of the House of Representatives endorsed the bill. It was opposed by Pennsylvania's <a href="Thaddeus%20Stevens">Thaddeus Stevens</a>, who represented the mining area from which Wharton extracted his nickel. Wharton had spent $200,000 to develop his mine and ore refinement machinery, Stevens related, and it was unfair to deprive him of the major use of his metal. "Shall we destroy all this property because by coining with another metal more money may be saved to the government?" Besides, he argued, the copper-nickel alloy for the cent had been approved by Congress, and the new metal, which he termed "brass", would show rust. He was rebutted by Iowa Congressman <a href="John%20A.%20Kasson">John A. Kasson</a>, chairman of the <a href="List%20of%20defunct%20United%20States%20congressional%20committees">House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures</a>, who stated that the bronze alloy did not resemble brass, and he could not support the proposition that the government is bound to purchase from a supplier because he has spent money in anticipation of sales.

The legislation passed the House, and the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201864">Coinage Act of 1864</a> was signed by President <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> on April 22, 1864. The legislation made base metal coins <a href="legal%20tender">legal tender</a> for the first time: both cents and two-cent pieces were acceptable in quantities of up to ten. The government would not, however, redeem them in bulk. The act also outlawed the private one- and two-cent tokens, and later that year Congress abolished all such issues. The legislation did not allow for the redemption of the old copper-nickel cents; it had been drafted by Pollock, who was hoping that the <a href="seignorage">seignorage</a> income from issuing the new coins would help finance Mint operations, and he did not want it reduced by the recall of the old pieces. Wharton and his interests were appeased by the passage of a bill for a <a href="three-cent%20piece">three-cent piece</a> in 1865 and a <a href="nickel%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">five-cent piece</a> in 1866, both of his proposed alloy, out of which the "nickel", as the latter coin has come to be known, is still struck. Despite this, Wharton and his nickel interests made repeated attempts to return nickel to the cent, each time failing, both as part of the deliberations over what became the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201873">Coinage Act of 1873</a>, and in the early 1880s.

The copper-nickel cents from early in 1864 were generally bought up by speculators and did not circulate in large numbers. The Mint began producing bronze cents on May 13, three weeks after the passage of the Coinage Act, and they were released into circulation on May 20. Dies prepared for copper-nickel pieces were used to strike bronze. Sometime during 1864, Longacre sharpened his design for use in striking the softer bronze pieces, and also added his initial "L". It is not known when this was done; it may have been as early as May, with the new dies used alongside the old. These bronze pieces are often referred to as "1864-L" and "1864 No L". The "L" is known on 1863-dated pieces, in both metals, and on 1864-dated copper-nickel pieces—some of these issues, all extremely rare, were likely struck at a later date. The bronze cent was immediately accepted by the public, and heavy production of the issue soon alleviated the shortage of cents.

In the postwar years, the heavy production of cents was scaled back, as hoarding ceased and some of the slack was taken up by other base-metal coins. Nevertheless, the various issues of small coins, at that time not redeemed by the government, caused another glut in commerce, which was not completely broken until the Act of March 3, 1871, allowed redemption of cents and other minor coins in lots of $20 or more. Pursuant to this act, over thirty million copper-nickel cents, of both the Indian Head and Flying Eagle designs, were redeemed; the Mint melted these for recoinage. Fifty-five million bronze cents were also sold to the government; beginning in 1874, the Mint re-issued these in response to commercial requests for cents, lowering the demand for new coins. Drops in the price of silver brought coins of that metal, hoarded for a decade or more, back into commerce, also decreasing demand. Between 1866 and 1878, production only occasionally exceeded ten million; the 1877 coin, with a circulation mintage of 852,500, is a rare date for the series. After 1881, there were few redemptions of bronze cents, due to high demand for the denomination, though copper-nickel cents continued to be redeemed and melted.

With the discontinuance of the two-cent piece and three-cent silver in 1873, the cent and the three-cent nickel were the sole survivors of the coins valued at less than five cents. The three-cent nickel, by this time, was unpopular because of its odd denomination and (with the return of silver coinage) its similarity in size to the <a href="dime%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">dime</a>. A three-cent postage rate had been one of the reasons why that denomination had begun, in the 1850s; in the early 1880s, the <a href="United%20States%20Post%20Office%20Department">Post Office</a> decreased the basic rate for letters to two cents. This change both increased demand for cents, and decreased the demand for the three-cent nickel, which was abolished in 1890. In most years of the 1880s, there were large issues of Indian Head cents. The exception was in the mid-1880s when poor economic times led to less demand for minor coins. No cents or five-cent nickels were minted after February 1885 until near the end of 1886. Production of undated dies into which the year of issue could be punched did continue, and during the hiatus in coin production, Chief Engraver <a href="Charles%20E.%20Barber">Charles E. Barber</a> modified the design, removing light outlines between the lettering on the obverse and the rest of the design, and making other changes. This led to two types for the 1886 Indian Head cent, which may be distinguished: on the Type I, the lowest feather on the obverse points between the I and the C in "AMERICA", while on the Type II it points between the C and the final A. Snow estimates that 14 million of the mintage of 17,654,290 were Type I, as were a majority of the 4,290 <a href="proof%20coin">proof</a> strikings.

The economic <a href="Panic%20of%201893">Panic of 1893</a> again caused a decrease in the number of cents produced, as coins accumulated in private hands were spent, creating a surplus. Aside from that, the final years of the series before its termination in 1909 were marked by large mintages, with 1907 topping the hundred million mark. A healthy economy in most years fueled demand, as did the increasing popularity of coin-operated machines, some of which could be found at <a href="penny%20arcade">penny arcade</a>s. By the early 20th century, the cent was accepted across the nation, but by law production of the cent was limited to the Philadelphia Mint. Treasury officials sought removal of this restriction, and for an increase in the annual appropriation to purchase base metals for production of the cent and nickel—the amount expended had remained the same since 1873, although demand for cents had greatly increased. By the Act of April 24, 1906, the Mint received permission to strike base metal coins at any mint, and the appropriation was quadrupled to $200,000. Small quantities of cents were struck at the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco Mint</a> in 1908 and 1909.

Congress passed legislation in 1890 allowing the Mint to alter designs that had been in use for 25 years without the need for legislative authorization. In 1904, President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> wrote to his <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</a>, <a href="Leslie%20Mortier%20Shaw">Leslie Mortier Shaw</a>, complaining that U.S. coinage lacked artistic merit, and enquiring if it would be possible to engage a private artist, such as sculptor <a href="Augustus%20Saint-Gaudens">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</a>, to prepare new coin designs. At Roosevelt's instructions, the Mint hired Saint-Gaudens to redesign the cent and the four gold pieces: the <a href="double%20eagle">double eagle</a> ($20), <a href="eagle%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">eagle</a> ($10), <a href="half%20eagle">half eagle</a> ($5), and <a href="quarter%20eagle">quarter eagle</a> ($2.50). As the designs of those pieces had remained the same for 25 years, they could be changed without an act of Congress, as could the Indian Head cent.
Saint-Gaudens originally conceived a flying eagle design for the cent, but at Roosevelt's request, developed it for the $20 piece after learning that under the 1873 act, an eagle could not appear on the cent. Writer and friend <a href="Witter%20Bynner">Witter Bynner</a> recalled that in January 1907, Saint-Gaudens was seriously ill with cancer, and was carried to his studio for ten minutes a day to critique the work of his assistants on current projects, including the cent. Saint-Gaudens died on August 3, 1907, without having submitted another design for the cent.

With the redesign of the four gold denominations completed by 1908, Roosevelt turned his attention to the cent. The centenary of the birth of assassinated president <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> would occur in February 1909, and large numbers of privately manufactured souvenirs were already being issued. Many citizens had written to the Treasury Department, proposing a Lincoln coin, and Roosevelt was interested in honoring his fellow <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a>. This was a break with previous American numismatic tradition; before the Lincoln cent, no regularly circulating U.S. coin had featured an actual person (as opposed to idealized personifications, as of "liberty").

In late 1908, Roosevelt sat for sculptor <a href="Victor%20David%20Brenner">Victor David Brenner</a>, who was designing a medal for the <a href="Panama%20Canal%20Commission">Panama Canal Commission</a>. It is uncertain how Brenner was selected to design the coin, but in January 1909, Mint Director <a href="Frank%20A.%20Leach">Frank A. Leach</a> hired him to design a <a href="Lincoln%20cent">Lincoln cent</a>. This went into circulation later in 1909, putting an end to the Indian Head cent series.

Indian Head cents were popular among coin collectors even in the half-century when they were produced; since then, with the growth of the hobby, interest has increased. The 1930s introduction of inexpensive coin albums to house the series and encourage collectors to seek a complete set came at a time when the bronze version of the Indian Head cent was still common in pocket change. They were not widely studied until the 1960s; numismatic writer Tom DeLorey, in his introduction to Snow's book, ascribes this to prejudice among numismatists who grew up with the Indian Head cent as a common circulation piece. He notes that the 1960 edition of <a href="R.S.%20Yeoman">R.S. Yeoman</a>'s "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>" (commonly, the "Red Book") listed only four dates for which there were <a href="Glossary%20of%20numismatics%23V">varieties</a>, one of which, the <a href="Glossary%20of%20numismatics%23O">overdate</a> 1869/68 was in error, as the final digit was actually over another 9. The 2018 edition of the "Red Book" lists varieties for 12 dates.

Like most other denominations of U.S. coins, the 1873 may be found in two varieties, depending on the appearance of the final digit of the date: the "Close 3" or "Closed 3" is from early dies, but after Chief Coiner <a href="A.%20Loudon%20Snowden">A. Loudon Snowden</a> complained that the "3" looked too much like an "8", Chief Engraver <a href="William%20Barber%20%28engraver%29">William Barber</a> modified his work to create the "Open 3". Some 1875 pieces have a dot appearing on the letter "N" in "ONE" on the reverse. This may have been a secret mark, added to catch a thief within the Philadelphia Mint.

The Indian Head cent was struck in large quantities and most dates remain inexpensive: Yeoman lists all dates from 1900 to 1908 from Philadelphia at $2 in <a href="coin%20grading">Good-4 condition</a>. The record holder for the denomination is a proof specimen of the 1864-L, of which there were an estimated 20 struck; it sold for $161,000 in 2012.

The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest

The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest (also known as Jonny Quest: The Real Adventures) is an American animated action-adventure television series produced by <a href="Hanna-Barbera">Hanna-Barbera</a> and broadcast on <a href="Cartoon%20Network">Cartoon Network</a> from August 26, 1996 to April 16, 1997. A continuation of the "<a href="Jonny%20Quest%20%28TV%20series%29">Jonny Quest</a>" (1964) series and the "<a href="The%20New%20Adventures%20of%20Jonny%20Quest">The New Adventures of Jonny Quest</a>" (1986) series, it features teenage adventurers Jonny Quest, Hadji Singh, and Jessie Bannon as they accompany Dr. Benton Quest and bodyguard Race Bannon to investigate strange phenomena, legends, and mysteries in exotic locales. Action also takes place in the <a href="virtual%20world">virtual realm</a> of QuestWorld, a <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">three-dimensional</a> cyberspace domain rendered with computer animation. Conceived in the early 1990s, "Real Adventures" suffered a long and troubled development.

Hanna-Barbera dismissed creator Peter Lawrence in 1996 and hired new producers to finish the show. John Eng and Cosmo Anzilotti completed Lawrence's work; David Lipman, <a href="Davis%20Doi">Davis Doi</a>, and Larry Houston wrote new episodes with reworked character designs akin to those of classic "Quest". Each team produced half of the show's fifty-two episodes. While Lawrence's team crafted stories of real-world mystery and exploration, later writers used science fiction and paranormal plots. <a href="Turner%20Entertainment">Turner</a> supported the show through a massive marketing campaign with thirty-three licensees. "Real Adventures" debuted with an unprecedented wide release on Cartoon Network, <a href="TBS%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29">TBS</a>, and <a href="Turner%20Network%20Television">TNT</a>, airing twenty-one times per week. Critics have debated the merits of the show's animation, writing, and spirit compared to classic "Quest", but it has also received praise in those categories.

"Real Adventures" failed to gain high ratings with its targeted demographics and its merchandise performed poorly, leading to cancellation after fifty-two episodes. Turner Home Entertainment and Warner Home Video have released eight VHS tapes, two laserdiscs, and twenty-six DVD episodes; reruns have appeared on <a href="Toonami">Toonami</a>, <a href="CNX%20%28TV%20channel%29">CNX</a>, and other Turner networks. All 52 episodes were made available for digital purchase on the iTunes Store in 2013.

Hanna-Barbera created "The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest" in the early 1990s after being acquired by Turner Entertainment Co. Turner planned a series of year-long "Turner-wide initiatives" to capitalize on old characters and create new franchises. Turner received copious fan mail and phone inquiries about "Quest", and observed "incredibly high" marketing <a href="Q%20Score">Q Score</a>s. The show was also Hanna-Barbera's most popular venture in the action-adventure genre; no other contemporary series featured realistic children enjoying lifelike adventures. With <a href="William%20Hanna">William Hanna</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Barbera">Joseph Barbera</a>'s blessings, the company planned a new series, live action film, and two telefilms—"<a href="Jonny%27s%20Golden%20Quest">Jonny's Golden Quest</a>" and "<a href="Jonny%20Quest%20vs.%20The%20Cyber%20Insects">Jonny Quest vs. The Cyber Insects</a>". Combined with a substantial marketing campaign, the project would be their largest initiative since Turner acquired H-B. Turner Home Entertainment President Philip Kent claimed "Quest" would be a "consumer-products bonanza", and the company considered "Real Adventures" the linchpin of the "Quest" revival. "Real Adventures", the live-action film, and release of classic episodes on VHS would constitute a "Year of "Jonny Quest"" marketing blitz. Delayed until 1996, the project echoed 1994's "Year of the "<a href="Flintstones">Flintstones</a>"" and 1995's "Year of "<a href="Yogi%20Bear">Yogi Bear</a>"". Production on "Real Adventures" commenced in 1993. Turner hired a team led by director <a href="Dick%20Sebast">Dick Sebast</a>, writer <a href="Peter%20Lawrence%20%28author%29">Peter Lawrence</a>, and art director Takashi Masunaga. The firm appointed Stephanie Sperber head of the "Quest" task force in 1994.

Hanna-Barbera President <a href="Fred%20Seibert">Fred Seibert</a> allowed Lawrence to create a new team of companions for Jonny, but Lawrence chose to revive the original group. Sebast and Lawrence decided to make the series as realistic as possible through accurate physics and depictions of machinery. Lawrence emphasized believability, eschewing "ridiculous ...laser guns" for real sidearms. The creative team researched child psychology, ensuring they could depict realistic action and consequences without fueling nightmares. Seibert described the show's theme as ""The <a href="X-Files">X-Files</a>" for kids", citing difficult questions and mysteries to be posed in each episode. Departures from the classic series included new character designs and the introduction of a new character to the "Quest" family. Takashi designed Jonny to be "edgy and handsome", and rendered characters in the style of Japanese animation to differentiate from American superhero cartoons. The team used a new character—Race's daughter, Jessie Bannon—to create conflict with Jonny. She was introduced in "Jonny's Golden Quest" as Race's daughter by Jezebel Jade. Lawrence initially titled the show "Jonny Quest's Extraordinary Adventures", but the title changed in 1995 to its final name. Intended for a 1995 release with 65 episodes, "Real Adventures" fell into <a href="development%20hell">development hell</a>; roughly 30 scripts and only eight reels were in progress by March 1995. Both Lawrence and Takashi were removed in 1996, hiring John Eng and Cosmo Anzilotti to finish the first twenty-six episodes. Certain sequences necessitated exhaustive work and heavy revision.

A new team led by David Lipman, Davis Doi, and Larry Houston finished twenty-six more for broadcast as a separate series named "The New Jonny Quest". Time Warner's acquisition of Turner negated this plan, leading to the episodes' release as the second season of "Real Adventures". Fred Seibert touted "Quest" as the ""<a href="Home%20Alone%20%28film%29">Home Alone</a>" of adventure", with "high-tech, multicultural themes" that would appeal to contemporary youth. Promoters promised the new "Quest" would avoid "mindless violence, chauvinism, xenophobia and insensitivity", addressing historical criticisms of the classic series. Turner also claimed that "Quest" would appeal to any gender, stating, "Traditionally, action adventure animation may be stronger with boys, but in this case, storylines are being developed to draw girls in ... we're really hoping for a wide berth of viewership."

Peter Lawrence aimed to "go beyond cartooning and into animated film-making" for the show's storytelling. Producers contracted seven studios to animate the first season, including Pacific Animation Co. in Japan and Toon's Factory in France. Japanese and Korean animators drew traditional <a href="cel">cel</a> sequences and added color; an international team handled digital post-production and QuestWorld scenes. Teva, a subsidiary of Total Group, organized a post-production team in Paris, led by Eric Jacquot, Gilles Deyries, and Pascal Legeay. Using video post-production high-end specialized tools, including "Henry", "Spirit", "Flame", and others, the team strove to deliver a high-speed computer editing and post-production process. The majority of the first season's footage was digitally inked and painted to enhance background elements. Producers applied the process in excess of twenty hours per episode, adding light effects, rain, snow, glitter, reflections, and fog.

Hanna-Barbera implemented a new computer system to combine manual animation with digital paint, and to provide camera movement flexibility, which created a partial <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">three-dimensional</a> effect. Takashi felt the system made the creative team "honest filmmakers" through hands-on production. Lawrence described the system in 1995:

This is the same group that set up and maintained the in-house digital ink and paint systems for Hanna Barbera as well as the <a href="Avid%20Technology">Avid</a> and <a href="Avid%20Technology">Pro Tools</a> systems used in Post Production. The group was founded and managed by Stephen Toback. "Real Adventures" maintained the classic show's realistic violence, featuring off-screen deaths of villains and allies. Japan-based Mook Studios exclusively animated the second season without digital post-processing. The show's format dictated that title sequences be aired first, followed by a short introduction, the first act, and the second act, with commercial breaks between.

Bodie Chandler directed music for "Quest", and Gary Lionelli, Thomas Chase, <a href="Stephen%20Rucker">Stephen Rucker</a>, Lawrence H. Brown, <a href="Guy%20Moon">Guy Moon</a>, Kevin Kiner, <a href="Christophe%20Beck">Christophe Beck</a>, and Mark Koval wrote incidental music and cues. Lionelli conceived a new main theme based on the original 1960s "Jonny Quest" theme by <a href="Hoyt%20Curtin">Hoyt Curtin</a>. Composer Guy Moon considered working for the show the "hardest thing I've done in my life" due to the producers' demands for epic music: "They want a big orchestra with a good synth rig... It's great because they push me so much I'll probably replace my whole demo reel with 'Jonny Quest' music... It's hip and it's current." Stephen Rucker and Thomas Chase (who later composed in "<a href="The%20Powerpuff%20Girls">The Powerpuff Girls</a>") used <a href="MIDI">MIDI</a> to facilitate composing. Chase appreciated the producers' commitment to scoring, noting, "For many kids, animation music is their first exposure to orchestral music."

Producers cultivated an element of <a href="virtual%20reality">virtual reality</a> through QuestWorld, a cyberspace simulation rendered with three-dimensional computer animation and motion capture. QuestWorld was designed as a futuristic application of contemporary technology, similar to the classic series' high-tech lasers, satellites, and robots. Seibert traced its origin to "the same problem that James Bond has... When you look at even his newest gadgets, they're somewhat quaint." H-B marketers polled children on their familiarity with virtual reality, discovering that each child was aware of the concept. Planners took inspiration from <a href="cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a> novels written by <a href="Neal%20Stephenson">Neal Stephenson</a> and <a href="William%20Gibson">William Gibson</a>, including "<a href="Snow%20Crash">Snow Crash</a>". Short, independent QuestWorld segments called "Quest Bytes" concluded certain episodes.

QuestWorld characters were created as <a href="Wire-frame%20model">wire frame</a> models, augmented with faces scanned from clay busts, then digitally painted and inked. Animation company Buzz F/X, based in Montreal and Santa Monica, created first season sequences. Work began in April 1996 with the opening titles—a gliding journey through a canyon of green, cartographic lines with scenes illuminated upon the walls. Buzz F/X used mostly inexperienced animators, as budgetary constraints would not permit hiring seasoned employees.
Work followed on "Escape to Questworld" and "Trouble on the Colorado" as animators worked 12 hours a day, six days a week in a small garage with inadequate computers. Buzz F/X augmented the small team in July with ten recruits, but only two were experienced. Amateur employees struggled with lighting, and with synchronizing jerky motion capture from the House of Moves in Venice Beach; "Quest" was their first capture production order. By August, the team was working 14 hours a day, seven days a week, including full nights and mornings.

After two more episodes, Buzz F/X terminated its unprofitable contract with H-B, later filing for bankruptcy in 1997 due to $3.6 million of debt created by work on "Quest". H-B hired <a href="Blur%20Studio">Blur Studio</a> to finish the second season's scenes on a ten-week production schedule. Blur used <a href="Intergraph">Intergraph</a> hardware, and its sharp performance attracted press attention and sealed an amicable relationship with H-B. Both companies produced in total roughly one hundred minutes of computer animation for QuestWorld.

Turner Entertainment promoted the series in forty countries and fourteen languages to establish international markets. Broadcasters included <a href="Antena%203%20%28Spain%29">Antena 3</a> in Spain, <a href="TF1">TF1</a> in France, <a href="Channel%20One%20%28Russia%29">Channel One</a> in Russia, <a href="RAI">RAI</a> in Italy, Taurus Film in Germany, the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> in the United Kingdom and <a href="Asia%20Television">Asia Television</a> in ten Asian countries, representing ATL's first animated series to be broadcast in both English and Cantonese. Turner planned to introduce US-style animation to the Asian market through "Quest". The show was launched in Singapore on <a href="MediaCorp%20Channel%205">TCS Channel 5</a> (now known as MediaCorp Channel 5) to take advantage of Singapore's "sophisticated retail sector and well-developed licensing industry". "Brandweek" reported in 1995 that the show's budget, including merchandising and promotional costs, topped $40 million.

Director <a href="Richard%20Donner">Richard Donner</a>, producer <a href="Lauren%20Shuler%20Donner">Lauren Shuler Donner</a>, and <a href="Jane%20Rosenthal">Jane Rosenthal</a> purchased rights for a live-action film, having expressed interest in the property after Turner acquired H-B. <a href="Peter%20Segal">Peter Segal</a> was attached to direct. Slated to begin production in mid-1995, filming was delayed until 1996 and ultimately never began. Turner advertised "Real Adventures" as the "next evolution in children's programming ... [redefining] television animation for the next generation." The company hosted a 1995 discussion with Peter Lawrence and Takashi at Yanceyville, and later aired previews at United States waterpark events. Staged in major US cities, these "dive-in theaters" featured previews of new series and local celebrities, including <a href="Jennifer%20Love%20Hewitt">Jennifer Love Hewitt</a>, <a href="Lacey%20Chabert">Lacey Chabert</a>, <a href="Cameron%20Finley">Cameron Finley</a>, and <a href="Ashley%20Johnson">Ashley Johnson</a> for the UCLA event. Turner announced all the debut countries and TV stations as of May 1, 1996:

Turner aired "Real Adventures" seven nights a week on TBS, TNT, and Cartoon Network for an unprecedented 21 weekly showings. Turner aired several commercial spots featuring the "Quest" logo and show introductions to build <a href="Viral%20marketing">viral</a> support. Turner's marketers surmised that juvenile groups watching TNT in the morning, TBS in the afternoon, or Cartoon Network in prime time and late night were mutually exclusive. "Real Adventures" premiered August 26, 1996, three months after a twenty-hour "Farewell Marathon" of original "Quest".

The show averaged a 2.0 <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen rating</a> over August and September 1996, considered a strong start for an animated series. Though Cartoon Network suffered declining viewership in 1996, "Quest" was consistently one of the highest-rated programs; later season-one episodes drew around 650,000 viewers. "Real Adventures"s merchandise performed poorly, and it failed to build consistent ratings in its targeted demographics (though it did attract adult audiences). Turner tried to revive interest in February 1997 with a contest for an adventurous trip to Jamaica called "Quest World Adventure".

Cartoon Network did not order new episodes beyond the 52nd. Reruns aired for two years on Toonami until September 24, 1999, on Cartoon Network in other formats until January 3, 2003; and on CNX until 2003.

The show's premise is that Dr. Quest, a famous <a href="wikt%3Aphenomenology">phenomenologist</a>, investigates mysterious occurrences and exotic locales with his son, Jonny Quest, adopted son Hadji Singh, bodyguard Race Bannon, Race's daughter Jessie, and pet bulldog Bandit. "Real Adventures" is set a few years after the classic series, making Jonny and his friends teenagers. Lawrence aimed to use "existing, real phenomenon"—such as the "Airstrips of <a href="Nazca">Nazca</a>, the Ruins of <a href="Teotihuacan">Teotihuacan</a> or the possible existence of <a href="Giant%20Squid">Giant Squid</a>"—to capture audiences' curiosity. Stressing plausibility, he suggested writers cover real-world enigmas, <a href="cryptozoology">cryptozoology</a>, unique locales, an alien posing as the vice president, and fictional but "believable" mysteries. The Quests would frequently visit the virtual environment of QuestWorld, and encounter the villainous Jeremiah Surd and Ezekiel Rage. Paralyzed years prior by Race's SWAT team, Surd would try to exact revenge through technology; Rage—a former government agent left for dead on a botched mission—would try to destroy the world with nuclear terrorism.

The Quests would sparingly fight "<a href="Villain%20of%20the%20week">monsters of the week</a>", instead battling antagonists whose conflicts lay in "personal objective or ambition ... opposed by Dr. Quest". Lawrence stationed the family at a new compound on the coast of Maine, replete with houses, barns, and workshops. Rooms suited for each character included a library for Dr. Quest, workshop for Jonny, computer-equipped den for Jessie, dojo and gym for Race, and lighthouse lookout for Hadji's meditation. Lawrence equipped Dr. Quest with a fleet of air, land, and sea vehicles, including a 1940s biplane and state-of-the-art <a href="catamaran">catamaran</a> named "Questor" with diving bells and smaller research vessels stored in the hulls. Peter Lawrence prided "Real Adventures" on the strength of its writing, opining that "very few writers in this or any other field actually write visually," and contesting that each episode would have "enough material or potential to develop into a movie".

 Peter Lawrence described Jonny as a "hero in training" on the cusp of adulthood. He remarked that Jonny possessed "a straight-ahead, right-on attitude" free of introspection or self-doubt. 

Jonny Quest:

Jonny Quest, age 14, he's a confident problem-solver that's prone to getting in trouble. Writers framed him as more an intuitive thinker than an intellectual, and created tension by contrasting his father's academic leanings with Jonny's affinity for Race's daring lifestyle. Jonny inherited his father's driving curiosity (rendering him a "walking query"), as well as his mother's "restless, adventurous spirit". Takashi designed Jonny to be lean, wiry, athletic, and coordinated. Creative directors centered episodes around Jonny; Seibert summarized the shift:

Hadji:

Hadji Quest, age 16, became Dr. Quest's personal assistant, lacking his mentor's formal education but sharing his burning interest in archaeology, anthropology and the paranormal. A <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a>, as mentioned in the original series episode "Riddle Of The Gold," and a <a href="yogi">yogi</a>, he held a fatalistic attitude towards the show's drama, reacting to situations "from the philosophical point of view that everything is as it's supposed to be". Hadji often used wise aphorisms, taken from diverse cultures and sources and sometimes baffling Jonny. Lawrence cut Hadji's classic <a href="telekinesis">telekinesis</a> to align his abilities with realistic yogi practices. "He doesn't say things like 'Sim, Sim Sala Bim' anymore," season one voice actor <a href="Michael%20Benyaer">Michael Benyaer</a> explained. "The writers and producers actually researched the actual yogic powers. He can do more plausible stuff. There is an episode where Hadji pretends to stop his breathing so that the bad guys think he is dead." Takashi drew Hadji taller and thinner than his classic counterpart.

Jessie Bannon:

Jessie Bannon, age 15, was characterized to be just as tough, smarter, and more thoughtful than Jonny. Written as "more of an egghead", she elected to spend time with Dr. Quest as Jonny did with Race, and was "more in tune with Hadji". Turner conceived Jessie as cool, independent, and a strong role model for contemporary girls. Peter Lawrence took pains to ensure Jessie would not be written as "a guy in a skirt", and made her more mature than Jonny.

Race Bannon:

Race Bannon (Jessie's father) age 38, retained his classic, laconic sense of humor and fearless, dependable nature. He retired from government work over ethical scruples with his former intelligence agency. Writers noted that Race was helplessly overprotective of Jessie, and Jonny was "the boy Race never had". Race was also given a western-US accent and a knack for crafting elaborate, colorful similes. Peter Lawrence sculpted Race to be a "cowboy philosopher or philosopher-warrior". Writers tasked Race with physical and self-defense training for the Quest team.

Dr. Benton Quest:

Dr. Benton Quest, age 55, retired from government research and operated from the "Quest Compound" on the coast of Maine. Driven by curiosity, he was "consulted by individuals, governments and corporations" to investigate enigmatic events. Described as "single-minded—almost to the point of obsession—in his pursuit of knowledge", he often encountered trouble as "his drive to learn blanks out more basic instincts like self-preservation." Jessie appreciated his ponderous sense of humor. The show's promoters summarized him as the "benevolent king" archetype. 

Bandit

Bandit the family dog also appeared in the series. Lawrence removed Bandit's clownish origins, stressing that Bandit could not understand English, nor reliably save the family from perilous situations. 

Summarizing the group's behavior, Lawrence wrote, "Jonny's response to danger will be close to Race's. Jessie's intrigue with mysterious, unexplained phenomena will be close to Dr. Quest's and Hadji, with his roots in a different culture and a more spiritual approach to life, is different again."

Takashi designed each character as physically fit and well-sculpted to reflect "a more exercise-oriented society". Fred Seibert downplayed worries that the new characters would disappoint cult fans of the classic series. He hoped "Real Adventures" would find success as new interpretations of <a href="comic%20book">comic book</a> heroes had done.

Season two directors Larry Houston and Davis Doi changed the show to resemble the classic franchise. Writer Glenn Leopold revived Hadji's latent psionic powers—including spoon-bending and rope tricks—as he felt the first season's realism was "not that interesting to watch". All characters lost a year in age; Jonny became 13. Writer Lance Falk returned Race to governmental guard duty, sealed by an episodic visit with classic "Quest" spymaster Phil Corven. Race lost his western accent (with Falk even comparing Race's western accent to <a href="Batman">Batman</a> having a French accent), and Dr. Quest regained his classic red hair and exhibited rudimentary combat skills. Falk regarded Jessie as the "missing piece needed to complete the Quest family", and Leopold added slight romantic overtones to episodes. Some fans complained about changes to Jessie, criticized as a <a href="damsel%20in%20distress">damsel in distress</a> with stereotypically female pink clothes. Jonny saved Jessie from danger several times. Falk defended his portrayal as giving her realistic, human fears, such as <a href="claustrophobia">claustrophobia</a>. Censors asked the second season team to replace firearms with dart guns, notably in the episode "General Winter".

Second season writers took greater creative liberties with "Real Adventures", invoking ghosts, other dimensions, and megalomaniacal schemes. Leopold and Falk sought to create a "slam-bang adventure show with real monsters" and heightened narrative emphasis on Jonny and his friends. Falk explained that cool contrivances took precedence over accuracy, stating that ""Jonny Quest" is a show with one foot in the "fantastic", and one foot solidly based in reality." Opposed to QuestWorld, the new team was nonetheless contractually obligated to use it in their episodes.

Falk felt that virtual reality undermined the show's "strong connection to reality", and suggested that after so many dangerous incidents Dr. Quest would have turned the system off. Writers brought back several classic characters, including Pasha the Peddler, Jezebel Jade, <a href="Dr.%20Zin">Dr. Zin</a> and his twin daughters, Anaya and Melana. Falk honored "Quest" creator <a href="Doug%20Wildey">Doug Wildey</a> by creating an eponymous grandfather for Jonny in the episode "Nuclear Netherworld", as well as homage to <a href="William%20Hanna">William Hanna</a>'s birthstate of <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a> where Jonny's grandfather resides. The team created Estella Velasquez as Jessie's mother to <a href="Retroactive%20continuity">retcon</a> the telefilms, feeling that Jade would never get married. Writers eventually killed off villains Ezekiel Rage and Dr. Jeremiah Surd in favor of new adversaries. Comparing "Quest" without Zin to "James Bond without S.P.E.C.T.R.E.", Falk penned a season finale featuring classic robot spies and a visceral fight between Dr. Quest and Zin. Falk planned to resuscitate Palm Key as the "Quest" home in new episodes. Cartoon Network did not renew "Real Adventures", despite a pledge to explore the history of Jonny's mother Rachel in the season premiere.

The first season of "Real Adventures" featured <a href="J.%20D.%20Roth">J. D. Roth</a> as Jonny, <a href="George%20Segal">George Segal</a> as Dr. Quest, <a href="Robert%20Patrick">Robert Patrick</a> as Race, <a href="Jesse%20Douglas%20%28actress%29">Jesse Douglas</a> as Jessie, <a href="Michael%20Benyaer">Michael Benyaer</a> as Hadji, and veteran voice actors <a href="Frank%20Welker">Frank Welker</a> and <a href="Michael%20Bell%20%28actor%29">Michael Bell</a> as Dr. Jeremiah Surd and Ezekiel Rage, respectively. A childhood fan of the original series, J.D. Roth was inspired by Turner's vision for the new series and swiftly accepted the role of Jonny. Roth was attracted by Jonny's "star quality", and approved of his characterization as a real kid without superpowers. He enjoyed Jonny's infectious enthusiasm and impulsive alacrity. Roth also admired the show's educational quality, something he had tried to integrate in his personal television pilots. When asked about how he played the relationship with Jonny's father, he commented, "Jonny is crazy about his dad. He looks up to him and thinks he is the smartest man ever to walk to face of the earth. He has the typical teenage relationship with his father, but his father definitely sees something in him. Dr. Quest knows that Jonny is going to be something really special." Michael Benyaer also enjoyed playing Hadji: "[he] is one of the few roles for an ethnic actor that is not a bad guy. I mean, how many East Indian heroes have been on television? Hadji is for the sensitive kids out there. He is the outsider in all of us." A "Star Wars" fan, Benyaer was happy to work with <a href="Mark%20Hamill">Mark Hamill</a> for "In the Realm of the Condor". Peter Lawrence's request for an Indian-descended voice actor was seen as an "unusual case of multi-ethnic casting".

The producers struggled to cast Jessie Bannon. Peter Lawrence ultimately chose Jesse Douglas, who he felt reflected Jessie's energy and intelligence—"[Jesse Douglas] has immense energy, huge energy, and is the kind of woman who could do all the kind of things Jessie could do—you know, athletic, smart, so and so forth "[sic]"." Douglas impressed Lawrence with her active lifestyle, including ballet, equestrianism, and tennis. When asked about the character's inclusion, Douglas stated, "I'd be bummed if I upset anybody. Jessie is pretty cool. It is not like she is a girl who is whining all the time. If anything, she is a really good springboard for the rest of the storyline." Roth supported her, claiming that "Jonny hasn't discovered girls yet but when he does Jessie would be the type of girl he'd like to be with...I think something will happen between them but right now Jess is his best friend." H-B Chief Fred Seibert agreed, hinting that as adults "there might be a <a href="Spencer%20Tracy">Tracy</a>/<a href="Katharine%20Hepburn">Hepburn</a> thing going on." Turner approached George Segal to audition for the part of Dr. Quest. Segal described the show as having "a real family feeling about it... I'd never seen this stuff before. That was quite remarkable."

Hanna-Barbera bought out the first cast's contracts and hired new actors for the second season. This cast featured <a href="Quinton%20Flynn">Quinton Flynn</a> as Jonny, <a href="John%20de%20Lancie">John de Lancie</a> as Dr. Quest, <a href="Granville%20Van%20Dusen">Granville Van Dusen</a> (for the first two episodes) and <a href="Robert%20Foxworth">Robert Foxworth</a> as Race, <a href="Jennifer%20Hale">Jennifer Hale</a> as Jessie, and <a href="Rob%20Paulsen">Rob Paulsen</a> as Hadji. Paulsen previously voiced Hadji in the two "Quest" telefilms. <a href="Don%20Messick">Don Messick</a> attempted to reprise his classic role as Dr. Quest, but was forced into retirement by a stroke during early sessions. Van Dusen voiced Bannon in the 1986 "Quest" series, and Foxworth took over the part after auditioning for Dr. Quest. Frank Welker and Michael Bell reprised their roles as Surd and Rage in the second season. 

Throughout the two seasons, several notable guest stars included <a href="Kevin%20Conroy">Kevin Conroy</a>, <a href="Earl%20Boen">Earl Boen</a>, <a href="Clancy%20Brown">Clancy Brown</a>, <a href="Robert%20Ito">Robert Ito</a>, <a href="James%20Shigeta">James Shigeta</a>, <a href="Irene%20Bedard">Irene Bedard</a>, <a href="Lucy%20Liu">Lucy Liu</a>, <a href="Brock%20Peters">Brock Peters</a>, <a href="Tristan%20Rogers">Tristan Rogers</a>, <a href="Edward%20Asner">Edward Asner</a>, <a href="Julian%20Sands">Julian Sands</a>, <a href="Helene%20Udy">Helene Udy</a>, <a href="Mayim%20Bialik">Mayim Bialik</a>, <a href="Mark%20Hamill">Mark Hamill</a>, <a href="Andreas%20Katsulas">Andreas Katsulas</a>, <a href="Jeffrey%20Tambor">Jeffrey Tambor</a>, <a href="Dorian%20Harewood">Dorian Harewood</a>, <a href="Clive%20Revill">Clive Revill</a>, <a href="Kenneth%20Mars">Kenneth Mars</a>, <a href="Nick%20Chinlund">Nick Chinlund</a>, <a href="George%20Kennedy">George Kennedy</a>, <a href="Clyde%20Kusatsu">Clyde Kusatsu</a>, <a href="Dean%20Jones%20%28actor%29">Dean Jones</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Gibson">Thomas Gibson</a>, <a href="Sarah%20Douglas%20%28actress%29">Sarah Douglas</a> and <a href="Carl%20Lumbly">Carl Lumbly</a>. Season two writer Lance Falk has also regretted not thinking about veteran voice actor <a href="John%20Stephenson%20%28actor%29">John Stephenson</a>, who was the very first voice of Dr. Quest, for a guest role.

Turner launched a massive marketing campaign to promote "Real Adventures", intending to reach 80% of American children aged six to eleven. Each Turner network spent $5 to $7 million for a total $20 million invested in promotion; the company contracted 33 licensees. Other reports pegged the budget at $40 million, and "Marketing Week" estimated that the series launched with $300 million of merchandising support. "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>" called "Quest" a "property to watch" in 1995; "People" and "Good Housekeeping" considered it a surefire blockbuster. Turner provided digital and bound <a href="style%20guide">style guide</a>s featuring collections of "Quest" artwork, coloring instructions, and product ideas.

Produced for $100,000 and believed to be the first of its kind, the digital style guide included fonts, logos, character art, merchandising mock-ups, voice clips, and other interactive content. Hanna-Barbera launched "Questworld.com" as the show's internet hub, presenting it as if written by members of the Quest team. Complementing the show's educational, real-world premise, the site hosted links to academic, archaeological, and exploratory websites. Turner announced 32 licensees as of summer 1996:

Turner marketed "Real Adventures" through a substantial diversity of products, considering its "Quest" campaign a role model for future shows. <a href="Galoob">Galoob</a> acquired figurine licensing rights in 1995 and created a product line of vehicles, figures, and <a href="Micro%20Machines">Micro Machines</a> for fall 1996 release. Turner felt that Galoob's commitment legitimized the "Quest" marketing plan, and next secured partnership with <a href="Pizza%20Hut">Pizza Hut</a> and food retailers. <a href="Pillsbury%20Company">Pillsbury</a> included $3 mail-in rebates for future "Quest" videos, display contests, and instant coupon offers on over 20 million packages. <a href="Campbell%20Soup%20Company">Campbell Soup Company</a> released six holographic miniature posters on the same number of <a href="SpaghettiOs">SpaghettiOs</a> cans; the posters were awarded in "Converting" in 1997. <a href="General%20Mills">General Mills</a> outfitted boxes of <a href="Honey%20Nut%20Cheerios">Honey Nut Cheerios</a> and <a href="Cinnamon%20Toast%20Crunch">Cinnamon Toast Crunch</a> with offers for T-shirts and other items. Over five thousand Pizza Hut restaurants held a two-month-long give-away of figurines with meals during the show's launch. Galoob failed to build popularity for its toys outside the United States, and discontinued the line in 1997.

<a href="Upper%20Deck%20Company">Upper Deck Company</a> used art, sketches, and plots from the first season to create a sixty-piece card collection. Turner also marketed <a href="W.%20C.%20Bradley%20Co.">Zebco</a> <a href="fishing%20pole">fishing pole</a>s bearing the "Quest" logo. <a href="Kid%20Rhino">Kid Rhino</a> produced a cassette audio adventure based on the episode "Return of the Anasazi". The show's credits advertised a soundtrack available from Rhino, never sold or otherwise promoted. Turner listed several products in a "Quest Adventure Value Pack" coupon catalogue.

Marketers tied in classic "Quest" merchandise, launching a classic H-B promotion with <a href="Days%20Inn">Days Inn</a> hotels, <a href="Planet%20Hollywood">Planet Hollywood</a> restaurants, and <a href="Little%20Debbie">Little Debbie</a> snack cakes and offering rebates for "Cyber Insects" and classic episodes. The marketing campaign culminated with the release of eight VHS "Real Adventures" season one episodes. Turner also released two episodes on laserdisc. Metropolitan newspapers worked with Turner to promote the videos through grab-bag give-aways. Turner sold merchandise through several international distributors, and expected to make a $60 million profit per year in the Asia-Pacific region alone.

<a href="Empresas%20Polar">Savoy Brands International</a> handled South American distribution, involving 750,000 retail outlets in Argentina, Chile, Peru, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Venezuela, Ecuador and Columbia. Turner debuted "Quest" at a cocktail party for the European Licensing Fair in late 1996, and released merchandise in Europe through 90,000 retail outlets over the next six months. <a href="Copyright%20Promotions%20Licensing%20Group">Copyright Promotions Licensing Group</a> handled lincensing in the United Kingdom. Turner ensured that the license agreements forbade retailers from discounting "Quest" items. The size of the marketing initiative left one newspaper reviewer wondering, "are [the Quests] back because they're too cool to die, or because they're too well known to be squandered as a licensing product?" Turner worried that the promotion might overhype the brand, and timed commercial rollouts over the life of the show. H-B chief Fred Seibert expected high sales and success:

<a href="Terry%20Bisson">Terry Bisson</a> and others working under the alias "Brad Quentin" produced 11 original novellas featuring adventure and virtual reality themes. Critics appreciated that the books may have drawn kids to reading, especially those interested in technology. Only certain comics and coloring books used season two's designs, such as Dark Horse's "Countdown to Chaos", featuring General Vostok. Turner stopped marketing the show until April 2004, when <a href="Warner%20Home%20Video">Warner Home Video</a> released episodes "Escape to Questworld" and "Trouble on the Colorado" as "TV Premiere DVD: The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest" on MiniDVD.

<a href="Virgin%20Interactive">Virgin Interactive</a> produced an adventure game for the series named "Cover-Up At Roswell", released in August 1996. Known as "Escape from Quest World" in development, "Roswell" cost $1 million to make. Virgin handled all marketing, sales, and distribution; Turner cross-promoted. Developers recycled fifty minutes of footage and art from six season one episodes to construct a new story about the Quest family gathering alien artifacts and saving an extraterrestrial from autopsy at <a href="The%20Pentagon">The Pentagon</a>. Jeremiah Surd and the <a href="Men%20in%20Black">Men in Black</a> of General Tyler plan to misuse the technology and try to hinder the Quests. Gameplay consists of clicking areas on images of locations to navigate paths. Players sometimes encounter minigames, such as guiding a diving bell away from rocks or shooting rats with a slingshot. Virgin designed certain segments to be viewed with packaged stereostopic Chromatek plastic glasses.

Virgin estimated the game would provide 20–25 hours of game play for adults and 80–100 hours for children. The season two cast provided all voices except for Michael Benyaer as Hadji and Charles Howerton as Dr. Quest. The game's music featured a "high-intensity orchestral sound" prone to monotony. One reviewer praised "Roswell" for "good entertainment and variety", but regretted low <a href="replay%20value">replay value</a> and no modes of difficulty. Critics were divided over the puzzles, naming them both "ingenious" and "elementary". Peter Scisco of ComputerLife and FamilyPC's testers criticized some of the puzzles for relying on "reflexes, not logical thinking".

"Entertainment Weekly" rated the game B+, naming the puzzles "unimaginative...Pac-Man rip-offs and dopey jigsaws". Scisco appreciated the nonviolent content and the inclusion of Jessie as a strong female character, but considered the extraterrestrial story too familiar. A writer from the "Sydney Morning Herald" warned against buying the game for easily frightened children, but recommended it for those who enjoy mental challenges.

Turner, TBS, and Holiday Inn partnered to hold an essay contest as part of the Safe America Foundation's "Quest for Safety" drive. From October 9 to November 4, 1996, spots encouraged children to write essays about important safety issues and personal safety. A panel of public safety and community leaders selected the winner, dubbing them the "Safest Kid in America". TBS posted the winner's essay to the kids section of its website and awarded them a position on the "Real Adventures" float for the 1997 <a href="Tournament%20of%20Roses%20Parade">Tournament of Roses Parade</a> in Pasadena. Second-prize winners received bicycle helmets, T-shirts, and "Jonny Quest" lapel pins. Turner staged an international contest in February 1997 called "Quest World Adventure", featuring the grand prize of a trip to a "secret island" (Jamaica) in July to take part in a staged dramatic scenario.

Commercials instructed fans to mail in episodes' geographical destinations during <a href="sweeps">sweeps</a> week. Advertisements appeared through Time Warner's television channels, "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated%20for%20Kids">Sports Illustrated for Kids</a>", DC Comics publications, radio stations, and Warner Brothers stores. The contest marked the first time that Cartoon Network U.S., TNT Europe, Cartoon Network Europe, Cartoon Network Asia, and Cartoon Network Latin America united for a single promotion. Turner encouraged local cable operators to submit their own spots, generating 34,000 ads among 174 cable systems for a total of $3.4 million cross-channel media support. 50,000 children with a median age of ten entered the competition, and 20,000 answered correctly. Turner selected ten viewers from the United States and nine from Latin America and Asia as grand-prize winners. They and two-hundred others received "Quest"-themed adventure packs, including a backpack, flashlight and siren, travel journal, pen, T-shirt, and glow sticks. Cartoon Network aired the names of winning children on a special feature in which Jeremiah Surd issued personal threats.

Winners received all-expenses-paid trips to <a href="Ocho%20Rios">Ocho Rios</a>, Jamaica, with up to three family members. Planners kept the destination secret until shortly before travel. In Jamaica, kids combated Surd's "environmental terrorism" by preventing him from finding the Jamaican "<a href="wikt%3AIrie">Irie</a>" stones. Children received clues on the mission through e-mails seemingly written by Jonny Quest. Posing as allies, network employees prepared clues, buried treasure, and hosted barbecues, reggae concerts, and rafting trips. Participants searched for the stones at the White River, <a href="Dunn%27s%20River%20Falls">Dunn's River Falls</a>, and Prospect Plantation; hosts filmed the proceedings for possible future promotions. The quest centered on cerebral challenges and puzzles. Attendees also learned about the history and ecology of Jamaica. The adventure doubled the show's ratings for February sweeps and tripled "Questworld.com"s hits. "Brandweek" awarded it the year's top honors for a global marketing promotion.

On October 8, 1996, <a href="Turner%20Entertainment">Turner Home Entertainment</a> and the Cartoon Network Video line released all four volumes of the series on VHS, "The Alchemist", "Rage's Burning Wheel", "The Darkest Fathoms" and "Escape to Questworld", with each videocassette containing two episodes along with two bonus shorts from the "<a href="What%20a%20Cartoon%21">What a Cartoon!</a>" series. <a href="Warner%20Home%20Video">Warner Home Video</a> released only "Escape to Questworld" on <a href="MiniDVD">MiniDVD</a> in April 2004, then WHV (via <a href="Hanna-Barbera%20Productions">Hanna-Barbera Productions</a> and <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Family%20Entertainment">Warner Bros. Family Entertainment</a>) released the first thirteen episodes on February 17, 2009 as "Season 1, Volume 1 of The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest" on DVD in <a href="DVD%20region%20code%231">Region 1</a>. On March 27, 2012, <a href="Warner%20Archive%20Collection">Warner Archive</a> released "The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest: Season 1, Volume 2" on DVD in Region 1 as part of their <a href="Hanna%E2%80%93Barbera%20Classics%20Collection">Hanna–Barbera Classics Collection</a>. This is a Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) release, available exclusively through Warner's online store and Amazon.com. The complete second (and final) season was released to DVD on November 10, 2015 from Warner Archive. All 52 episodes were made available for digital purchase in 2013 on the iTunes Store.

Announcement of Jessie Bannon's inclusion caused backlash among "Quest" fans. "TV Guide"'s editors feared that Jonny and Jessie would become romantically entangled, declaring her an "icky female". H-B Chief Fred Seibert responded, "Jessie is a little older and smarter than Jonny... We're not doing "<a href="Moonlighting%20%28TV%20series%29">Moonlighting</a>" here." Seibert also denied that Jessie had been created solely to appeal to little girls, citing extant support for Jonny and the classic team. A "Miami Herald" columnist called Jessie an "effort to rewrite the past to conform to the sociopolitical mandates of the present" and <a href="political%20correctness">political correctness</a> "run amok". "Billboard" conversely welcomed the change over an all-male cast. The fiasco subsided after the "Cyber Insects" telefilm aired; the "Atlanta Journal-Constitution" rebuffed the "icky girl" label, as Jessie saved Jonny's life and taught him patience. A test screening of "Cyber Insects" to males revealed that though some questioned her addition, most understood that like certain elements criticized in the original series, it was a reflection of the times.

Some fans still took issue with the series' distance from classic "Quest", which suffered accusations of cultural insensitivity and "racial and sexual stereotypes". "Real Adventures" evoked critical comparisons to the original series. "Cinefantastique" felt "Real Adventures" remained true to the classic show's formula, and praised the "impressive" cast. Another critic recommended the show to "die-hard adult fans", affirming that "Real Adventures" maintained the violence and off-screen deaths of the old series, as even the opening titles featured "explosions, murder and mayhem". "The Washington Post" judged the first season as "grittier and more lifelike" than the original "Quest". "Chicago Tribune" critic Allan Johnson agreed that "Real Adventures" was less "way-out" and contrasted the shows in detail. "TV Guide" applauded the writing as "miles deeper and darker than on the old show"; Hadji's quotations impressed the magazine's reviewer. Chicago's "Daily Herald" called the first episode "vintage "Quest"", and "The Panama City Times-Herald" echoed this position:

Hanna-Barbera founder and chairman Joseph Barbera considered "Real Adventures" a "disaster" because of changes to the characters and stories. He conceded, "that's their business. Everybody needs to do their own thing." Critics generally enjoyed the characters and voice acting. "People" liked the cast, particularly George Segal. "Saturday Morning Fever" praised Jessie Bannon for her resemblance to Dr. Quest. Allan Johnson approved of the age jump, as Jonny and Hadji were now old enough to be part of the action. He considered Jessie "cool... she gives Jonny grief just because she can, and she's not afraid of the action." He did not enjoy the "toned down" portrayal of Race Bannon. Some fans objected to Race's Western accent in the first season. Peter Lawrence defended the portrayal of Race as a "man of action, not thought—though perfectly capable of deep thought", noting that his accent and mannerisms encouraged variety, surprise, and originality.

The quality of "Quest"s traditional and computer animation split critics. The "Toronto Star" scathingly criticized the show for "facile plots heavily laced with jarring science fiction and incongruous computer animation", naming QuestWorld a "poorly explained techno-gimmick." "<a href="Le%20Figaro">Le Figaro</a>" concurred, but praised QuestWorld for capturing the attention of young viewers. "The Star" praised QuestWorld, but regarded traditional sequences as "flat and textureless, with minimal characterization, unnaturally stiff movement, and poor execution of shading and shadow". Ted Cox of the "<a href="Chicago%20Daily%20Herald">Chicago Daily Herald</a>" agreed that animated motion was sometimes "remarkably uneven", but lauded realistic imagery like "the play of light on the ocean". "TV Guide" also found the animation somewhat flat, but considered the sound effects and backgrounds to be state-of-the-art.

The show's sound was warmly received by the industry. Episodes "Nuclear Netherworld" and "Alien in Washington" were nominated respectively for music and sound editing <a href="Golden%20Reel%20Award">Golden Reel Award</a>s in 1997, and the entire series was nominated for an animated sound editing Golden Reel Award in 1998. "Real Adventures" was also nominated for a 1997 <a href="Daytime%20Emmy%20Award">Daytime Emmy Award</a> for music direction and composition. Special effects director Alberto Menache criticized QuestWorld in "Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Video Games", considering it a mistake-laden failure. He explained that the size difference between the motion capturers and the characters caused unsteady animation and shaking, consequently mismatching interaction with props and uneven terrain.

Menache blamed the show's budget, which did not allow for digital post-production and review; producers instead expected "plug-and-play" results straight from the capture studio. Menache concluded that the QuestWorld sequences suffered from a "pipeline set up for mass production" with little testing or planning. "Quest"s Senior Vice President of Production <a href="Sherry%20Gunther">Sherry Gunther</a> admitted that the motion capture technology was "a little crude" and best suited for broad movements. Menache was less critical of the facial capture, considering it "medium-quality" but still unacceptable given H-B's resources. These criticisms mirrored the comments of Buzz F/X animator Francois Lord, who cited inexperienced Montreal animators and rushed production schedules. He pointed out that Blur Studios had more time, money, and experience for season two's sequences.

Odyssey Number Five

Odyssey Number Five is the fourth <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by the Australian rock band <a href="Powderfinger">Powderfinger</a>, produced by <a href="Nick%20DiDia">Nick DiDia</a> and released on 4 September 2000 by <a href="Universal%20Music">Universal Music</a>. It won the 2001 <a href="ARIA%20Music%20Awards%20of%202001">ARIA Music Award</a> for Highest Selling Album, Best Group and Best Rock Album. The album was the band's shortest yet, focusing on social, political, and emotional issues that had appeared in prior works, especially "<a href="Internationalist%20%28album%29">Internationalist</a>".

The album produced four <a href="single%20%28music%29">singles</a>. The most successful, "<a href="My%20Happiness%20%28Powderfinger%20song%29">My Happiness</a>", reached #4 on the <a href="ARIA%20Singles%20Chart">ARIA Singles Chart</a>, won the <a href="ARIA%20Music%20Awards%20of%202001">2001 ARIA Music Award</a> for "Single of the Year", and topped <a href="Triple%20J%20Hottest%20100%2C%202000">Triple J's Hottest 100</a> in 2000. The album also featured "<a href="These%20Days%20%28Powderfinger%20song%29">These Days</a>", which topped <a href="Triple%20J%20Hottest%20100%2C%202000">Triple J's Hottest 100</a> in 1999. The album was also ranked at number 1 in <a href="Triple%20J%20Hottest%20100%20Australian%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time%2C%202011">Triple J's Hottest 100 Australian Albums of All Time</a> poll in 2011.

Many critics lauded the album as Powderfinger's best work; one stated that the album was "the Finger's Crowning Glory", however, others were critical of the "imitation" contained in the album. Overall, the album won five ARIA Music Awards in 2001 and was certified <a href="Music%20recording%20sales%20certification">platinum</a> seven times, and earned an eighth in 2004. "Odyssey Number Five" was Powderfinger's first album to chart in the United States, and the band toured extensively around North America to promote its release.

In a 1997 interview, Powderfinger <a href="bassist">bassist</a> <a href="John%20Collins%20%28Australian%20musician%29">John Collins</a> hinted that the group's next album would be similar to their previous album, "<a href="Internationalist%20%28album%29">Internationalist</a>", while <a href="frontman">frontman</a> <a href="Bernard%20Fanning">Bernard Fanning</a> said in September 2000 that the lyrics on the album, like those on "<a href="The%20Metre/Waiting%20for%20the%20Sun">Waiting for the Sun</a>", were his "most personal and direct yet". Fanning said his lyrics were based on the "obstacles in the way of being in a relationship, especially in our work situation".

Powderfinger worked with <a href="record%20producer">producer</a> <a href="Nick%20DiDia">Nick DiDia</a> on "Odyssey Number Five", as they had done on "Internationalist", finishing the album in August 2000 after six weeks of recording. The band spent this time ensuring higher quality songs than on "Internationalist", which had featured out-of-tune guitars on "<a href="Passenger%20%28Powderfinger%20song%29">Passenger</a>".

"Odyssey Number Five" was Powderfinger's shortest album when recorded, running for approximately 45 minutes. The focus of the album was on restraint, with more simplistic lyrics than previously, and with a plain and simple message intended. Fanning said of his songwriting ethic: "You try and make it something that’s got some substance, but also, you can never do that at the cost of it having relevance to what you’re singing." Powderfinger manager <a href="Paul%20Piticco">Paul Piticco</a> commented that "their ethos is to be pushing the limits of their songwriting ability".

Like Powderfinger's previous album "Internationalist", "Odyssey Number Five" commented on <a href="sociology">social</a> and <a href="politics">political</a> issues heavily, with the primary point of focus being <a href="Indigenous%20Australians%23Indigenous%20Australians">Aboriginal affairs</a>. The lyrics of "<a href="Like%20a%20Dog%20%28song%29">Like a Dog</a>" attacked former <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister of Australia</a> <a href="John%20Howard">John Howard</a>'s <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia">Liberal</a> government for its treatment of <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Indigenous Australians</a>, and for breaking the "relaxed and comfortable" promise he made in the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201996">Australian federal election, 1996</a>. Lead singer <a href="Bernard%20Fanning">Bernard Fanning</a> related this to the band's other ethical stances—refusing to appear on "<a href="Hey%20Hey%20it%27s%20Saturday">Hey Hey it's Saturday</a>", for its anti-<a href="homosexual">gay</a> commentary, or not allowing Powderfinger songs to be used in <a href="jingle">jingle</a>s, amongst others—stating, "We're not here to set an example. We just want to be happy with ourselves and not end up with a guilty conscience." Fanning said that despite "Like a Dog" being about a political issue, it was not a political song, rather just Powderfinger "voicing our opinions". The band worked with boxer <a href="Anthony%20Mundine">Anthony Mundine</a> on the song's music video, whom Fanning praised as "the perfect lead, in terms of what the song is about and the fact that he’s prepared to speak up for what he believes in."

As well as providing social commentary, "Odyssey Number Five" also discussed love, a recurring motif in Fanning's songwriting. Fanning noted that one of the causes of this was his passion for <a href="soul%20%28music%29">soul</a> and <a href="gospel%20music">gospel music</a>, stating that he "listen[s] to a lot of soul music that's unashamedly about love and how good it makes you feel". Lead guitarist <a href="Ian%20Haug">Ian Haug</a> agreed, and also noted that the band as a whole were fully committed to Fanning's lyrics, stating "It's really important for us to agree with what Bernard is singing."

"Odyssey Number Five" marked Powderfinger's first successful attempt to enter the United States market. Fanning told "<a href="Billboard.com">Billboard</a>" in a 2001 interview that the band were not taking anything for granted, however, stating, "In America, we haven't really done any work yet to deserve any major popularity", with the "vibes" on previous albums failing to reach the American mainstream. Powderfinger toured extensively around the country, performing in 22 cities. As a result of these efforts, "<a href="My%20Happiness%20%28Powderfinger%20song%29">My Happiness</a>" was briefly placed on rotation on <a href="KROQ-FM">KROQ-FM</a> and several other <a href="radio%20station">radio station</a>s. The song ultimately peaked at #23 on the <a href="Modern%20Rock%20Tracks">Modern Rock Tracks</a> chart. This success was assisted by the band appearing on the "<a href="Late%20Show%20with%20David%20Letterman">Late Show with David Letterman</a>", and by supporting <a href="Coldplay">Coldplay</a> on tour. Guitarist <a href="Darren%20Middleton">Darren Middleton</a> summarised their work in the United States by stating "This year has been a bit of a blur."

"Odyssey Number Five" was released on 4 September 2000, on the <a href="Grudge%20Records">Grudge</a>/<a href="Universal%20Music%20Australia">Universal</a> record labels. The album was released in the United Kingdom on <a href="Polydor">Polydor</a>, with 15 minutes of video and an additional track "Nature Boy", at a later date. A sampler version was released in the United States in 2001, containing five tracks.

Four <a href="single%20%28music%29">singles</a> were released from the album. "<a href="My%20Kind%20of%20Scene">My Kind of Scene</a>" was the first; released as a <a href="promotional%20single">promotional single</a> in June 2000. The track was written for the 2000 film "", and appeared on its . Collins and Middleton recalled that the song was written and produced with photos of <a href="Tom%20Cruise">Tom Cruise</a> and <a href="Nicole%20Kidman">Nicole Kidman</a> on the wall of the band's studio "as inspiration". They noted that the band made three songs in response to the "Mission: Impossible 2" request, and that "My Kind of Scene" was chosen over "Up & Down & Back Again" and "Whatever Makes You Happy".

The second single from the album was "<a href="My%20Happiness%20%28Powderfinger%20song%29">My Happiness</a>", released on 14 August 2000 in Australia. "My Happiness" entered the <a href="ARIA%20Charts">ARIA Singles Chart</a> at #4, and spent 24 weeks on the chart, making it Powderfinger's highest charting single in Australia. It peaked at #7 on the <a href="RIANZ">New Zealand singles chart</a>, and spent 23 weeks in the top 50. Furthermore, "My Happiness" was Powderfinger's first single to chart in the USA, reaching #23 on the <a href="Modern%20Rock%20Tracks">Modern Rock Tracks</a> chart.

"<a href="Like%20a%20Dog%20%28song%29">Like a Dog</a>" was released as the third single on 15 January 2001. The song was heavy in political sentiment, akin to "<a href="The%20Day%20You%20Come">The Day You Come</a>" on "Internationalist". The <a href="riff">riff</a> for the song was written by <a href="Ian%20Haug">Ian Haug</a>, and the song's music video featured Australian Aboriginal <a href="boxing">boxer</a> <a href="Anthony%20Mundine">Anthony Mundine</a>, and was based on the 1980 <a href="Martin%20Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a> film "<a href="Raging%20Bull">Raging Bull</a>". <a href="Drummer">Drummer</a> <a href="Jon%20Coghill">Jon Coghill</a> said the song revolved around the question of "why the hell won’t John Howard say sorry to the Aboriginal people!" "Like a Dog" spent one week on the ARIA Singles Chart, at #40.

Two songs from the album, "<a href="The%20Metre/Waiting%20for%20the%20Sun">The Metre</a>" and "<a href="The%20Metre/Waiting%20for%20the%20Sun">Waiting for the Sun</a>", were released as a double <a href="A-side">A-side</a> to form the final single. The single was released on 21 August 2001, and included a cover of <a href="Iron%20Maiden">Iron Maiden</a>'s "<a href="The%20Number%20of%20the%20Beast%20%28song%29">Number of the Beast</a>". "Waiting for the Sun" was written by Fanning as a devotional, <a href="gospel%20music">gospel</a> style song. He said of the song; "It’s about being in a relationship and being really heavily happy with it." "The Metre" spent one week on the ARIA Singles Chart, at #31.

"Odyssey Number Five" mostly gained positive reviews, and was more successful than its predecessor, "Internationalist". "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" reviewer Marc Weingarten gave the album a B+. He stated that album entered new "terrain" in guitar rock, complimenting the "scratching and clawing guitars", drawing comparisons to <a href="Travis%20%28band%29">Travis</a> ("prim") and <a href="Oasis%20%28band%29">Oasis</a> ("mock-grandiose").

<a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a> reviewer Dean Carlson disliked the album, giving it a rating of one and a half stars. He described it as "little more than a slightly off-base perspective into the world of mid-90s American grunge", and described it as highly similar to <a href="Neil%20Young">Neil Young</a>. Despite this, Carlson's did praise the songs "Odyssey #5" and "<a href="My%20Happiness%20%28Powderfinger%20song%29">My Happiness</a>", stating that "[t]oo often, Powderfinger is too earnest, a bit too careful in their career". Carlson noted that despite his critique, the album achieved some success in the American market.

Devon Powers of "<a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>" complimented Fanning's vocals, and said the focus of the album was "meaty, rolling ballads". Powers said that many of the songs on the album were "the kind of songs you put on repeat for hours, or days". The main critique was for the "faster numbers", stating that "<a href="Like%20a%20Dog%20%28song%29">Like a Dog</a>" "sounds mostly a little bored". The review concluded by noting that the best songs on "Odyssey" were those not available as "fleeting radio singles and background music".

"Odyssey Number Five" won the <a href="ARIA%20Music%20Awards%20of%202001">2001</a> <a href="ARIA%20Awards">ARIA Awards</a> for "Album of the Year", "Highest Selling Album", "Best Rock Album", "Best Cover Art", and "Best Group". "My Happiness" won the award for "Single of the Year", while "Like a Dog" was nominated for "Highest Selling Single" and "Best Video". At the <a href="ARIA%20Music%20Awards%20of%202002">2002 ARIA Awards</a>, "The Metre" was nominated for "Best Group". The album was named "Album of the Year" by "<a href="Rolling%20Stone%20Australia">Rolling Stone Australia</a>" readers, with "My Happiness" taking out "Song of the Year" and Powderfinger receiving "Band of the Year".

Wormshill

Wormshill ( ), historically Wormsell, is a small village and <a href="Civil%20parishes%20in%20England">civil parish</a> within the <a href="Borough%20of%20Maidstone">Borough of Maidstone</a>, <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, England. The parish is approximately south of <a href="the%20Swale">the Swale</a> and east of <a href="Maidstone">Maidstone</a>. The village of <a href="Frinsted">Frinsted</a> lies to the east and <a href="Bicknor">Bicknor</a> to the north-west; while <a href="Hollingbourne">Hollingbourne</a> is to the south-west. The village lies on an exposed high point of the <a href="North%20Downs">North Downs</a>, within the <a href="Kent%20Downs">Kent Downs</a> Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

Archaeological and <a href="Toponymy">toponymic</a> evidence of Wormshill's existence predates its appearance in the <a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday survey</a> of 1086. The village contains a number of <a href="Listed%20building">heritage-listed</a> buildings, which include a <a href="Norman%20architecture">Norman</a> church, a <a href="Pub">public house</a> and one of the oldest surviving post office buildings in the United Kingdom. The fields and woodland surrounding Wormshill have changed little in the past 500 years, and the village itself remains rural with a low population density compared to the national average. The population of 200 is a mixture of agricultural workers employed by local farms and professional residents who commute to nearby towns.

Wormshill was listed under the name "Godeselle" in the <a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a> of 1086. The village is thought to be much older, its name deriving from the <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> god <a href="W%C5%8Dden">Wōden</a> (a cognate with the <a href="Norse%20mythology">Norse</a> god, <a href="Odin">Odin</a>) and meaning "Woden's Hill". The area was also described in a paper in "Archaeologia Cantiana", 1961, as "Wormshill, an ancient possession of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kent">Kings of Kent</a>, the hill where they worshipped the heathen Woden". The <a href="University%20of%20Nottingham">University of Nottingham</a>'s Institute for Name-Studies has offered the suggestion that the name means "shelter for a herd of pigs".

The <a href="Latin">Latin</a>ised form, "Wornesell", appears in the <a href="Kent%20Hundred%20Rolls">Kent Hundred Rolls</a> of 1274–75 and in a <a href="mediaeval">mediaeval</a> <a href="Will%20%28law%29">will</a> recorded in September 1409. A corruption of the name, "Wormsell", is mentioned as the birthplace of a <a href="Cistercian">Cistercian</a> <a href="Abbot">Abbot</a> at the nearby <a href="Boxley%20Abbey">Boxley Abbey</a> in 1474; a further variant, "Wormysell", is found in a will of 1487, and court papers concerning a land dispute in 1534 use the name "Wormeshell".

A 1994 landscape survey identified woodland to the north of the village as having contained ancient <a href="Flint%20%28tool%29">flint tools</a> and what appeared to be <a href="flint">flint</a> boundary markers, the latter apparently gathered from loose-lying surface flints. The area around the village features ancient <a href="denehole">denehole</a>s, or agricultural chalk mines, some of which are pre-<a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman</a>. These holes, which may be up to deep, were often dug at the edges of fields, onto which the chalk <a href="marl">marl</a> would be spread. A <a href="Lower%20Palaeolithic">Lower Palaeolithic</a> (<a href="Acheulian">Acheulian</a>) hand axe was unearthed in the garden of "Blacksmiths cottage" in the village. In 1966, the remains of a U-shaped mediaeval pastoral enclosure for controlling the
movement of stock were recorded in woodland to the north of the village. The extensive woodland in the parish also meant that it was one of several sources of wooden planking for the piers of <a href="Rochester%20Bridge">Rochester Bridge</a> ( away) from the early 11th century (and theoretically was still liable to do so until the passing of the Rochester Bridge Act in 1908).

The parish of Wormshill was originally appended to the village and parish of <a href="Boughton%20Malherbe">Boughton Malherbe</a>, since both had the same patron; the patron of a parish was the land-owner who often built the church on the estate and who had the right (known as <a href="advowson">advowson</a>) to appoint the parish priest. The first recorded patron of Wormshill was <a href="Robert%20de%20Gatton">Robert de Gatton</a>, who owned the <a href="manorialism">Manor</a> of Wormsell during the reign of <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">Henry III</a> (1207–72). From the Gatton family, the village passed by marriage in the 13th century to Sir Simon de Northwood, whose coat of arms appears in the stained glass of <a href="St%20Giles%2C%20Wormshill">St Giles</a>, the village's only church, and whose name ("Norwood") is given to the farm at the north of the village.

Patronage of the parish subsequently transferred through a number of landholding families, vesting by the 17th century with the prominent Kent family of <a href="Sir%20Charles%20Sedley%2C%205th%20Baronet">Sir Charles Sedley</a>, which at times held the <a href="English%20feudal%20barony">barony</a> of <a href="Aylesford">Aylesford</a>. During this period the <a href="Tylden%20family">Tylden (or Tilden) family</a>, believed to have had links to the <a href="Third%20Crusade">Crusades of Richard I</a>, were also significant landholders in the area in the early 17th century; a memorial to William Tylden, who died in 1613, rests in the north <a href="chancel">chancel</a> of St Giles church. Around the same time in the late 16th century, recruits of <a href="Francis%20Drake">Sir Francis Drake's</a> navy may have used a track, now known as "Drake Lane", in the south west of the parish or camped nearby as they marched from the <a href="Weald">Weald of Kent</a> to the dockyards at <a href="Sheerness">Sheerness</a>.

Patronage is believed to have lapsed from the Sedley family to the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> and then to Sir Joseph Aylosse before being conveyed by gift from a Mr. Serjeant Moses to the <a href="Charity%20%28practice%29">charity</a> of the president and governors of <a href="Christ%27s%20Hospital%23History">Christ's Hospital</a> in London in gratitude for a <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> scholarship he had received. As late as 1798 the parish was still paying its traditional <a href="castle-guard">castle-guard</a> rent to <a href="Dover%20Castle">Dover Castle</a> and retained a <a href="court%20baron">court baron</a>; this fee was a substitute for a feudal obligation requiring the provision of knights to defend the castle.

Little (if any) information exists about the village's population or demographics before 1801; however evidence from the first census indicates that the village grew steadily, reaching a peak in 1871. A possible indication of the growth in the agricultural output of the village is the construction of two <a href="windmill">windmill</a>s (possibly used for the production of oil from <a href="linseed">linseed</a> or <a href="rapeseed">rapeseed</a>) marked at "Beddington" (present-day <a href="Bedmonton">Bedmonton</a>) on Ordnance Survey drawings dated 1797 and an Ordnance Survey map published between 1819 and 1843. The mills stood north and south of each other and were approximately to the north-west of the church. House building continued during the mid-to-late 19th century, together with a post office and school. Like much of rural Kent during the time of the <a href="Swing%20Riots">Swing Riots</a> (1830), Wormshill experienced a degree of civil unrest and <a href="Home%20Office">Home Office</a> records indicate that "a large body of men, numbering 50-100" assembled at Wormshill with the purpose of "intimidation and to enforce demands on farmers ... inducing other labourers to join them".

Records indicate that at least one former resident of the village fought as part of the Australian contingent in the <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli Campaign</a> of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>. Private Frederick George Kite, born at Wormshill on 16 February 1894, and educated at Wormshill and Milstead, enlisted on 8 September 1915. Originally employed as a fireman, after training at Blackboy and <a href="Broadmeadows%2C%20Victoria">Broadmeadows</a> camps in Victoria, he sailed from Melbourne as part of the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a>, <a href="16th%20Battalion%2C%20Royal%20Western%20Australia%20Regiment">16th Infantry Battalion</a> aboard HMAT Ceramic A40 on 23 December 1914. He participated in the landing at Gallipoli and was wounded in the left arm and shoulder, ending his active service.

During the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, Wormshill joined a number of similar settlements in the region to form part of the <a href="British%20anti-invasion%20preparations%20of%20World%20War%20II">anti-invasion network</a>. On the outskirts of the village, near the hamlet of <a href="Ringlestone">Ringlestone</a>, there are the remains of a "zero station" (or "Operational Base"), a secret underground communications relay post operated by <a href="Auxiliary%20Units">Auxiliary Units</a> of the <a href="British%20Home%20Guard">British Home Guard</a>. In the event of a <a href="Wehrmacht">German</a> invasion the zero station was to be used by defending forces to receive and transmit coded messages between a series of similar stations in the area as well as to the operational command headquarters at Hannington Hall in <a href="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a>. A concealed underground concrete bunker, it was designed to be invisible from the surface and is located in woodland about from the road. Although its primary purpose was a communications post, the zero station was also designed to hold ammunition and explosives and provide living quarters for the radio equipment operators. Anecdotal evidence also indicates that <a href="anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft gun</a>s were sited near the village and that a <a href="Bren%20light%20machine%20gun">Bren gun</a> emplacement was installed in the valley between Wormshill and <a href="Frinsted">Frinsted</a>. A <a href="Operation%20Diver">Diver Battery</a> was located to the south west of the village. Forming part of the Kentish Gun Belt, designed to provide a defence to attacks by <a href="V-1%20flying%20bombs">V-1 flying bombs</a> or "doodlebugs", it was armed with eight mobile 3.7-inch guns, and manned by 424 Battery of 138 Regiment of the 40th Anti Aircraft Brigade. It was initially equipped with Predictor AA No.10 and No.3 Mark V radar, and was manned by 57 Brigade in July 1944. There are records of a V-1 being shot down by a <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a> to the west of the village. <a href="Flight%20lieutenant">Flt Lt</a> A. R. Cruikshank is reported as having "Sited a Diver north of Ashford and attacked from astern at 100 yards range. Saw strikes and Diver fell and exploded in a field". Villagers resident during the war also recall a V-1 being shot down in orchards near "Norwood Farm" and a fighter aircraft crashing in fields to the south of "Yew Tree Farm". Roadside checkpoints were set up on the main routes into the village to the north and south and allied forces moving through the region camped overnight in the area, including a detachment of <a href="New%20Zealand%20Army">New Zealand troops</a> in fields near "Home Farm".

Following an initial decline in the population at the turn of the 20th century, more houses were constructed between the <a href="Great%20War">Great War</a> and the Second World War and again in the 1950s and 1960s, adding to the cluster of cottages from the 19th century and earlier.

At the time of the <a href="Kent%20Hundred%20Rolls">Kent Hundred Rolls</a> in 1275, Wormshill was in the <a href="Hundred%20%28county%20division%29">Hundred</a> of Eyhorne, a regional sub-division used in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> by <a href="feudal">feudal</a> and crown officials to administer communities. Although the Hundred of Eyhorne (including Wormshill) still exists, it is a <a href="mediaeval">mediaeval</a> anachronism and no longer has any practical or administrative significance. In the 19th century, the village was within the <a href="Lathe%20%28county%20subdivision%29">lathe</a> of <a href="Aylesford">Aylesford</a>, the Bearsted <a href="petty%20sessional%20division">petty sessional division</a> and the <a href="Hollingbourne%20Rural%20District">Hollingbourne Rural District</a>. The village was also incorporated into the Hollingbourne <a href="Poor%20Law%20Union">Poor Law Union</a> (a means of funding and administering the operation of the <a href="Poor%20Laws">Poor Laws</a> in the area). The parish of Wormshill in part sits astride the <a href="West%20Kent">West Kent</a> and <a href="East%20Kent">East Kent</a> divide, a demarcation which until 1814 applied to an administrative boundary for the purposes of the law courts' <a href="Quarter%20Sessions">Quarter Sessions</a>. According to <a href="Edward%20Hasted">Edward Hasted</a> (writing in 1798): "northward of the church, including the borough of Bedmanton, is in the division of East Kent, but the rest of it, including the church and village, is in that of West Kent". This differs from the traditional distinction between "Men of Kent" and "Kentish Men", which are separated by the <a href="River%20Medway">River Medway</a>, accordingly persons born in Wormshill would be "Men of Kent".

Since 1975, Wormshill has been administered within the North Downs <a href="Wards%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">ward</a> and, together with surrounding communities, elects a representative councillor for the ward in the <a href="Borough%20of%20Maidstone">Borough of Maidstone</a>. The incumbent councillor for the North Downs ward is Patrik Garten. The village forms the central focus of the <a href="Civil%20parishes%20in%20England">civil</a> and <a href="Parish%23England">church parishes</a> of Wormshill. The parish chairman is Simon Bass. Wormshill is part of the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20parliament">parliamentary</a> <a href="constituency">constituency</a> of <a href="Faversham%20and%20Mid%20Kent">Faversham and Mid Kent</a>, whose <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> is <a href="Helen%20Whately">Helen Whately</a> of the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a>. It is also in the <a href="South%20East%20England%20%28European%20Parliament%20constituency%29">South East England constituency</a> in the <a href="European%20Parliament">European Parliament</a>.

At , the village is in central Kent, approximately south-east of <a href="London">London</a>. The nearest town is <a href="Sittingbourne">Sittingbourne</a>, to the north. Wormshill is surrounded by villages and hamlets of a similar size, including <a href="Frinsted">Frinsted</a>, <a href="Bicknor">Bicknor</a>, <a href="Bedmonton">Bedmonton</a> and <a href="Hucking">Hucking</a>.

The village is on a high point of the <a href="North%20Downs">North Downs</a>. The nearby road intersection of "Black Post" is recorded on the <a href="Ordnance%20Survey">Ordnance Survey</a> maps at above sea level. The landscape is primarily characterised by undulating <a href="calcareous%20grassland">calcareous grassland</a> and ancient <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> woodland over <a href="chalk">chalk</a> <a href="downland">downland</a>. The settlement itself (as opposed to the wider parish) is on a downland ridge between two shallow <a href="dip%20slope">dip slope</a> valleys that separate it from Bicknor to the north-west and Frinsted to the east.
Wormshill's elevated and exposed position on the <a href="North%20Downs">North Downs</a> means it occasionally experiences extreme weather conditions such as the heavy snowfalls of 11–14 January 1987, March 2005, February 2009 and January 2010. In the late 18th century Hasted commented: "Being exposed to the northern aspect, it lies very bleak and cold."

Much of the local woodland was devastated by the <a href="Great%20Storm%20of%201987">Great Storm of 1987</a>, which in October swept across south-east England with hurricane-force winds. A significant part of the exposed woodland to the north-east of Wormshill was felled and, after <a href="reforestation">replanting</a>, has only recently shown signs of maturing. An ancient <a href="Taxus%20baccata">yew</a> tree believed to have stood for several hundred years in the grounds of the house at Norwood Farm was destroyed along with other long-standing trees. However, some 25 years later, the village displays few obvious signs of the damage.

The countryside around the village has been described as "an area where the whole landscape is a piece of history—a valley where time has stood still and the pattern of woods and fields is much as it was 500 years ago". A designated <a href="ancient%20woodland">ancient woodland</a> lies to the north-west of the village. Predominantly centred on "Barrows Wood" but also including "High Wood" and "Trundle Wood", this is likely a remnant of the woodland described by Hasted: "... at the northern boundary of the parish there is a considerable quantity of wood, consisting mostly of hazel and oak, with numbers of trees of the latter, interspersed among them, which are but small, never here growing to any size." An ancient track that passes through the remnants of this woodland has been damaged by the use of <a href="off-road">off-road</a> vehicles leading to attempts by local landowners to block "Drake Lane", a <a href="Byway%20%28road%29">byway</a> that runs through "Drake Lane Wood" in the south-west of the parish and which may have been used by recruits of Sir Francis Drake's navy. Deep water-logged ruts in the track have resulted in the partial resurfacing of the route.

The village stretches primarily along a single carriageway road known as "The Street". The north-eastern end of "The Street" is a designated <a href="Conservation%20Area">Conservation Area</a>. The lack of development stems from its position within the <a href="Kent%20Downs">Kent Downs</a> Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and a <a href="Site%20of%20Nature%20Conservation%20Interest">Site of Nature Conservation Interest</a>, which influences <a href="Town%20and%20country%20planning%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">local planning laws</a> and limits permission to build new housing. All development is subject to a high level of scrutiny; any development that would adversely affect the natural beauty of the landscape will automatically be resisted, and large-scale development proposals must be accompanied by an environmental impact assessment. The last major development was that of the residential cul-de-sac "Draysfield".

The record in the Domesday Book does not give the population in 1086, though several people are named. By the late 19th century the village and parish were described as:
WORMSHILL, a parish in Hollingbourn" <nowiki>[sic]</nowiki> "district, Kent; 5 miles S by W of <a href="Sittingbourne%20railway%20station">Sittingbourne r. station</a>. It has a post-office under Sittingbourne. Acres, 1,467. Real property, <a href="%C2%A3">£</a>1,295. Pop., 253. Houses, 46. The property is divided among a few. The living is a rectory in the diocese of <a href="Canterbury">Canterbury</a>. Value, £260.* Patron, <a href="Christ%27s%20Hospital">Christ's Hospital</a>, London. The church is plain. Charities, £12.
Wormshill's location remains rural. Because of geography and restrictions on development, building in the village has been scant since the 1960s and 1970s. In 1821, the parish contained only 26 dwellings: by 2001, the total number of houses had risen to 82.

The rural nature of the area is indicated by a population density of approximately 0.4 persons per <a href="hectare">hectare</a> (1 person for every 6.9 <a href="acre">acre</a>s), compared to the average for the south-east of England of 4.2 persons per hectare (1 person for every 0.6 acres).

The village has been recorded as a distinct parish unit for the purpose of census statistics since the first <a href="Census%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom census</a> in 1801. The majority of the official population of 198 (per <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Census%202001">United Kingdom Census 2001</a>) is aged 45 or over and lives in homes comprising married family units. The total population has increased by around 40 people since 1801 however, during the past 200 years, it has fluctuated more widely within that range. In 1801 the population was 157 before peaking at 253 in 1861. In <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Census%201901">1901 census records</a> indicate a parish population of either 163 or 169.
Data for the ethnicity of the wider Maidstone area show that the population is around 97 percent white and that the remainder is of mixed, black, and Asian descent. Specific figures for Wormshill held by <a href="Kent%20County%20Council">Kent County Council</a> indicated in 2001 that all the villagers were of white ethnicity.

Wormshill includes two farms: "Yew Tree Farm" (dairy farming) at the south end of the village, and "Norwood Farm" (fruit and other crops) at the north end. A third farm, "Home Farm" appeared on late 19th and early 20th centuries Ordnance Survey maps in the centre of the village. This farm is no longer in use, but some outbuildings remain. Wormshill at one time included a blacksmith's shop, which is recorded on Ordnance Survey maps until 1898. According to the 1831 Census, 40 of the 48 adult males in the village were employed in the agricultural sector. Census records from the mid-to-late 19th century show a marked increase in the construction of new homes, representing the largest growth in the village for the next 100 years; however, the 1901 Census still described the majority of workers as "labourers and servants". The population spike between 1821 and 1901 is a trend typical to the general growth in the need for physical labour from parishes in the <a href="Kent%20Downs">Kent downland</a> agricultural region in the 19th century which was followed in the early 20th century by the increasing mechanisation of farming activity. Although the farms continue to employ from the village, as of 2008 Wormshill is largely a <a href="commuter%20town">dormitory village</a>, with residents employed in nearby towns or commuting to London. The <a href="National%20Statistics%20Socio-economic%20Classification">socio-economic classification</a> of Census 2001 indicated that the most common occupations were "lower managerial and professional occupations" (21.9 percent) and "small employers and own account workers" (15.2 percent).

Until the end of the 20th century, the village had a post office and <a href="General%20store%23United%20Kingdom">general stores</a> along with a public house, "The Blacksmiths Arms", a <a href="Listed%20building">Grade II listed building</a>, in part of 17th century origin.

The original post office opened in 1847 and was run by church warden Tom Clements from a building next to the rectory. The building, which now forms part of a Grade II* listed private dwelling, is thought to be the second-oldest surviving post office building in England with a service dating from 1847. The post office briefly moved to another location in "The Street" under the stewardship of local schoolmistress Fanny Harris (who operated the service from 1926); however, it returned to the original site in 1946 under the new sub-postmistress Irene Bugden and was run as a small general stores until it closed in 1976. Fanny Harris (then 92 years old and the village's oldest inhabitant) and <a href="Robin%20Leigh-Pemberton%2C%20Baron%20Kingsdown">Robin Leigh-Pemberton</a> were passengers on the first <a href="Postbus%23United%20Kingdom">postbus</a> service on 4 March 1974. A new post office and stores operated at a different property in the village for a further 20 years until it was closed in the 1990s. Today, the village retains only the "Blacksmiths Arms" and a traditional red <a href="pillar%20box">post box</a>.

In the 19th century, an additional public house existed at the northern edge of the village near "Norwood Farm" and was known as "The Woodman's Arms" (and possibly also as "The Norwood Arms"). The pub was recorded on Ordnance Survey maps of the village between 1870 and 1946, but as of May 2012, the building is a Grade II listed private dwelling. Other listed buildings in the village include the <a href="timber%20framing">timber-framed</a> houses "Norwood Manor" and "Blacksmiths Cottage". A large country house now known as "Wormshill Court" and bordered to the north and east by a brick wall includes the outbuildings of "Manor Farm". The property is part of a large estate which has for several generations belonged to the Nightingale family. The house and farm is also shown on a map of 1636 and at that time appears to represent the only building in the village other than the church and the rectory. In 1858 a further map of the manor named the property "Court Lodge Farm" and included an inset plan showing the exchange of land between the governors of Christ's Hospital and a Mr. Henry Hudson.

Wormshill retained its own <a href="telephone%20exchange">telephone exchange</a> until the 1990s, when it became part of the Maidstone exchange. A <a href="red%20telephone%20box">red telephone box</a> remains in the village after residents insisted that it not be replaced with a modern design however the telephony was disconnected (and the box sealed) in November 2009 as a result of lack of use. An informal village noticeboard is on the side of an old flint and wood barn that was part of the former "Home Farm". The post box and telephone box are at the same location. The telephone box is a listed building.

The <a href="Bredgar%20and%20Wormshill%20Light%20Railway">Bredgar and Wormshill Light Railway</a> attracts tourists and railway enthusiasts throughout the summer season. The railway is a <a href="narrow%20gauge%20railway">narrow gauge</a> <a href="light%20railway">light railway</a> run between two small stations on about of track built in woodland between <a href="Bredgar">Bredgar</a> and Wormshill.

A number of <a href="ancient%20trackway">ancient trackway</a>s including the <a href="Pilgrims%27%20Way">Pilgrims' Way</a> and the <a href="North%20Downs%20Way">North Downs Way</a> (now designated as footpaths or byways) pass within a few miles of the village. Wormshill is not on any major roadways and has no rail service. No standard public transport facilities or taxicab operations exist in the village. A daily <a href="Postbus">Postbus</a> service, incorporated into the village postal delivery and collection timetable and which ran for 35 years, stopped on 14 November 2009. It was one of the last remaining postbus services in the United Kingdom. The service, run by the <a href="Royal%20Mail">Royal Mail</a> and subsidised by the county council, began in March 1974 and collected residents from Wormshill and other villages en route to <a href="Sittingbourne">Sittingbourne</a>. The closure of the only means of public transport to and from the village was controversial and, following a campaign by local councillors and journalists, the postbus was replaced by a temporary <a href="minibus">minibus</a> service, funded by the county council. Royal Mail postal deliveries continue to be made to the village. The village lies between the <a href="M2%20motorway%20%28Great%20Britain%29">M2</a> and <a href="M20%20motorway">M20</a> <a href="motorway">motorway</a>s, and the nearest railway station is at <a href="Harrietsham%20railway%20station">Harrietsham</a> on the <a href="Maidstone%20Line">Maidstone Line</a>, to the south by road.

A small one-roomed <a href="National%20school%20%28England%20and%20Wales%29">National school</a> (a school established by the <a href="National%20Society%20for%20Promoting%20Religious%20Education">National Society for Promoting Religious Education</a>) was built in the village in 1872 for about 30 children. However some evidence exists that it had "accommodation for forty-two children and an average attendance of twenty-eight". The school was recorded on maps of the village until 1909, although it was dissolved in 1930 (school mistresses Miss Fanny Harris and Miss Pepper later ran the post office and general store from an outhouse at Flint Cottage). The building that housed the school has since been converted to a private dwelling. The school's small playground was lined by lime trees planted in memory of a general at the end of the <a href="Boer%20Wars">Boer Wars</a>. As of November 2011 the lime trees are still there.
The nearest <a href="primary%20school">primary school</a> to the village is the Milstead and Frinsted Church of England School at <a href="Milstead">Milstead</a>. <a href="Secondary%20school">Secondary school</a> pupils are educated in the towns of Sittingbourne or <a href="Maidstone">Maidstone</a>.

The church, parts of which date back to the <a href="Norman%20architecture%23Ecclesiastical%20architecture">Norman era</a>, is dedicated to <a href="Saint%20Giles">Saint Giles</a> and forms part of the united <a href="benefice">benefice</a> of <a href="Tunstall%2C%20Kent">Tunstall</a> and <a href="Bredgar">Bredgar</a>, along with the villages of <a href="Rodmersham">Rodmersham</a>, <a href="Milstead">Milstead</a>, <a href="Bicknor">Bicknor</a> and <a href="Frinsted">Frinsted</a>. The <a href="ecclesiastical%20parish">ecclesiastical parish</a> of Wormshill is in the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Canterbury">Diocese of Canterbury</a> and the Sittingbourne <a href="deanery">deanery</a> (within the <a href="archdeaconry%20of%20Maidstone">archdeaconry of Maidstone</a>). As of March 2018, the <a href="rector%20%28ecclesiastical%29">rector</a> was the Reverend Alan Pinnegar.
In 1995, the church received a new ring of six <a href="bell%20%28instrument%29">bells</a> after a campaign by villagers begun in 1944 by Michael Nightingale of <a href="Cromarty">Cromarty</a>, who at age 16 opened a savings account with 10 <a href="shilling">shilling</a>s for the restoration of the church's bells. Fifty years later, he completed the full <a href="Ring%20of%20bells">ring</a> of six bells: one of the six was original, and the other five were rescued from abandoned churches. The last major renovations of the church occurred in 1789 and 1901.
Of note within the church are a Norman <a href="Baptismal%20font">font</a> and <a href="Tudor%20architecture">Tudor</a> <a href="pulpit">pulpit</a>. The church also contains a 13th century chest, first discovered in the early 20th century. The former rectory is now a private <a href="dwelling">dwelling</a>.

A <a href="vicar">vicar</a> at the Rectory of Wormshill in the 19th century, Reverend Josiah Disturnell, was the subject of a debate about exceptional <a href="Life%20expectancy">human longevity</a>; it was claimed that he lived to age 107. References to the rector's memorial stone in the church ultimately provided evidence that his actual age of death was "either 91 or 93". Sir Henry Rew, a leading authority on agricultural economics, a former assistant secretary at the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Agriculture%2C%20Fisheries%20and%20Food%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</a> and president of the <a href="Royal%20Statistical%20Society">Royal Statistical Society</a> (1920–1922) died at his home in the village on 7 April 1929.

In January 2007, the church and its surroundings were used as locations in the filming of an episode of "<a href="EastEnders">EastEnders</a>", broadcast in the United Kingdom over the Easter 2007 holiday season. The production crew added mock gravestones and a temporary <a href="Victorian%20architecture">Victorian</a>-style street lamp to the churchyard. Also featured were other locations in and near the village, including exterior shots of the "Blacksmiths Arms" combined with interior views of the nearby "<a href="Ringlestone%20Inn">Ringlestone Inn</a>".

The village holds typical English rural festivals during the year. The spring and <a href="harvest%20festival">harvest festival</a>s are horticultural shows that include the surrounding villages. The <a href="f%C3%AAte">country fair</a> (or fête) in the summer previously included traditional country games, stalls and attractions such as <a href="Straw%20bale">hay bale</a> throwing, <a href="tug%20of%20war">tug of war</a> and a <a href="coconut%20shy">coconut shy</a>, although the village has not held a fête since 2009. Wormshill contains a community village hall and recreation ground, including a small playground. The 9th Sittingbourne (Tunstall and Wormshill) <a href="The%20Scout%20Association">Scout Group</a> are associated with the village and group meetings are occasionally held at the village hall. Wormshill, together with the united benefice villages of <a href="Bredgar">Bredgar</a>, <a href="Milstead">Milstead</a>, <a href="Bicknor">Bicknor</a> and <a href="Frinsted">Frinsted</a>, also produces a free monthly "Parish Magazine" including village news, announcements and occasional articles. In common with a number of rural communities in the county, Wormshill also receives a weekly <a href="Bookmobile">mobile library</a> service run by <a href="Kent%20County%20Council">Kent County Council</a>.

Restoration spectacular

The Restoration spectacular, or elaborately staged machine play, hit the <a href="London">London</a> public stage in the late 17th-century <a href="English%20Restoration">Restoration</a> period, enthralling audiences with action, music, dance, moveable <a href="theatrical%20scenery">scenery</a>, <a href="baroque%20illusionistic%20painting">baroque illusionistic painting</a>, gorgeous costumes, and <a href="special%20effect">special effect</a>s such as <a href="trapdoor">trapdoor</a> tricks, "flying" actors, and <a href="fireworks">fireworks</a>. These shows have always had a bad reputation as a vulgar and commercial threat to the witty, "legitimate" <a href="Restoration%20drama">Restoration drama</a>; however, they drew Londoners in unprecedented numbers and left them dazzled and delighted.

Basically home-grown and with roots in the early 17th-century <a href="court">court</a> <a href="masque">masque</a>, though never ashamed of borrowing ideas and stage technology from <a href="French%20opera">French opera</a>, the spectaculars are sometimes called "English opera". However, the variety of them is so untidy that most theatre historians despair of defining them as a <a href="genre">genre</a> at all. Only a handful of works of this period are usually accorded the term "opera", as the musical dimension of most of them is subordinate to the visual. It was spectacle and scenery that drew in the crowds, as shown by many comments in the diary of the theatre-lover <a href="Samuel%20Pepys">Samuel Pepys</a>. The expense of mounting ever more elaborate scenic productions drove the two competing theatre companies into a dangerous spiral of huge expenditure and correspondingly huge losses or profits. A fiasco such as <a href="John%20Dryden">John Dryden</a>'s "<a href="Albion%20and%20Albanius">Albion and Albanius</a>" would leave a company in serious debt, while blockbusters like <a href="Thomas%20Shadwell">Thomas Shadwell</a>'s "<a href="Psyche%20%28psychology%29">Psyche</a>" or Dryden's "<a href="King%20Arthur%20%28opera%29">King Arthur</a>" would put it comfortably in the black for a long time.

The distinction between "legitimate" Restoration drama and the Restoration spectacular, or "musical spectacular," or "Dorset Garden spectacular," or "machine play" is one of degree rather than kind. "All" plays of the period featured music and dancing and some scenery, most of them also songs. Restoration <a href="heroic%20drama">heroic drama</a>, for all its literariness, relied on opulent scenery. However, the true spectacular, of which Milhous counts only eight over the entire 1660–1700 Restoration period, was produced on a whole different scale. The spectacular is defined by the large number of sets and performers required, the vast sums of money invested, the potential for great profits, and the long preparation time needed. Milhous calculates a likely requirement of at least four to six months of planning, contracting, building, and rehearsing, to be compared with the four to six "weeks" of rehearsal time a new "legitimate" play would get.

Previous generations of theatre historians have despised the operatic spectaculars, perhaps influenced by <a href="John%20Dryden">John Dryden</a>'s sour comments about expensive and tasteless "scenes, machines, and empty operas". However, audiences loved the scenes and machines and operas, as <a href="Samuel%20Pepys">Samuel Pepys</a>' diary shows. Dryden wrote several baroque machine plays himself. The first, "<a href="The%20State%20of%20Innocence">The State of Innocence</a>" (1677), was never staged, as his designated company, the King's, had neither the capital nor the machinery for it: a dramatisation of <a href="John%20Milton">John Milton</a>'s "<a href="Paradise%20Lost">Paradise Lost</a>", it called for "rebellious angels wheeling in the air, and seeming transfixed with thunderbolts" over "a lake of brimstone or rolling fire". The King's Company's <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Theatre Royal, Drury Lane</a> was not up to lakes of rolling fire; only the "machine house" at Dorset Garden was, and that belonged to the competition, the Duke's Company. When the two companies had merged in the 1680s and Dryden had access to Dorset Garden, he wrote one of the most visual and special-effects-ridden machine plays of the entire Restoration period, "<a href="Albion%20and%20Albanius">Albion and Albanius</a>" (1684–85):
The Cave of PROTEUS rises out of the Sea; it consists of several arches of Rock-work adorned with mother-of-pearl, coral, and abundance of shells of various kinds. Through the arches is seen the Sea, and parts of Dover-pier; in the middle of the Cave is PROTEUS asleep on a rock adorned with shells, &c. like the Cave. ALBION and ACACIA seize on him; and while a symphony is playing, he sinks as they are bringing him forward, and changes himself into a Lion, a Crocodile, a Dragon, and then to his own shape again; he comes forward to the front of the stage, and sings."
How were such effects produced, and how did they look? The crocodile etc. obviously used the floor trap, but was it an <a href="Baroque%20illusionistic%20painting">illusionistically painted</a> figure worked with sticks, or a man in a crocodile suit? There are no extant drawings or descriptions of machinery and sets for the Restoration theatre, although some documentation exists for court masques from the first half of the 17th century, notably the work of <a href="Inigo%20Jones">Inigo Jones</a> and his pupil <a href="John%20Webb%20%28architect%29">John Webb</a>. One reason for the lack of information for the public theatres is that stage effects, and particularly machines, were trade secrets. Inventors of theatrical effects took great pains to hold on to their secrets, and the playhouses guarded their machine workings as zealously as a <a href="magic%20%28illusion%29">magician</a> guards her or his tricks.

What the technology and the visual experiences were can only be tenuously inferred from stage directions. Milhous concludes from a review of Dorset Garden performances that "at a conservative estimate" the theatre was equipped to fly at least four people independently, and had some very complex floor traps for "transformations" such as that of Proteus. The plates printed in the first edition of Elkanah Settle's "Empress of Morocco" (1673) (see detail, top right) are the only pictures of actual Restoration stage sets. Pepys' mentions of stage effects in his diary, 1660–68, give the modern reader some help in visualising what audiences saw in the 1660s, and even more in entering into their enthusiasms, but the 1660s were still early days. There are scarcely any descriptions or reactions preserved from the heyday of the machine play in the 1670s–90s, although a general idea of its technology can be gathered from the better-documented French and Italian opera scenery which inspired <a href="Thomas%20Betterton">Thomas Betterton</a> at Dorset Garden Theatre.

In the early 17th century, moveable "scenes"—painted <a href="Stage%20%28theatre%29%23Proscenium%20stage">wing</a>s and backdrops—and technical "machines" or "devices" for flying and other special effects were used in the <a href="masque">masque</a>s produced for and by the <a href="Noble%20court">court</a> of <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a>. In William Davenant's "<a href="Salmacida%20Spolia">Salmacida Spolia</a>" (1640), for instance, the last of the court masques before the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, <a href="Queen%20Henrietta%20Maria">Queen Henrietta Maria</a> (pregnant at the time) makes her entrance "descending by a theatrical device from a cloud." As early as 1639, Davenant had obtained a royal patent authorising construction of a large new public theatre with technology that would allow such effects and accommodate music, scenery, and dancing. Such an invasion of court-drama technique in the public theatre met opposition from "legitimate" dramatists, and before the opposition could be overcome, the war had closed down the theatres in 1642.

The public stage ban 1642–60 imposed by the <a href="Puritan">Puritan</a> regime represents a long and sharp break in dramatic tradition, but was still never completely successful in suppressing the ideologically hateful make-believe of play-acting. Performances in grand private houses were not unusual, and could have quite elaborate sets, as can be seen from the extant drawings for the original performance of Davenant's opera "<a href="The%20Siege%20of%20Rhodes">The Siege of Rhodes</a>" (1656) at his home <a href="Rutland%20House">Rutland House</a>. This was public theatre in all but name, as Davenant charged 5 shillings for admission. Some professional actors also managed to scrape a living and evade the authorities in stealth acting companies in London, such as that of <a href="Michael%20Mohun">Michael Mohun</a> at the <a href="Red%20Bull%20Theatre">Red Bull Theatre</a>. Professional writers from the previous era were growing middle-aged, biding their time, and hoping for the monarchy to be restored. By the later 1650s, it was becoming obvious that that time was at hand, and William Davenant, for example, stepped up his theatrical activities.

When the public performance ban was lifted at the <a href="English%20Restoration">Restoration</a> of the monarchy in 1660, <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> immediately encouraged the drama and took a personal interest in the scramble for acting licences and performance rights which followed. Two middle-aged pre-Commonwealth playwrights notable for their loyalty during Charles' exile emerged from the struggle with royal <a href="Letters%20Patent">Letters Patent</a> for new, or refurbished, <a href="patent%20theatre">patent theatre</a> companies: <a href="Thomas%20Killigrew">Thomas Killigrew</a> and <a href="William%20Davenant">William Davenant</a>. Killigrew was able to take over Michael Mohun's skilled veteran troupe for his "<a href="King%27s%20Company">King's Company</a>" and to start with "what was essentially a going concern" (Hume), with the added advantage of the traditional performance rights Mohun brought with him for practically the whole classic repertory of <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>, <a href="Ben%20Jonson">Ben Jonson</a>, and the <a href="Beaumont%20and%20Fletcher">Beaumont and Fletcher</a> team. The competition, Davenant's "<a href="Duke%27s%20Company">Duke's Company</a>", seemed doomed to a secondary position with its young, scratched-together troupe and scarcely any performance rights. They were only allowed to put on abridged and modernized versions of Shakespeare plays, and a few that Davenant had written. However, Davenant, "a brilliant impresario" (Hume), was soon able to turn the tables on Killigrew by realising his old pre-Civil War dream of music, dance, and spectacular visual effects on the public stage.

During the autumn of 1660, while the Duke's Company was still getting financed (mostly by means of the actors buying company shares) and having temporary quarters set up, the King's Company offered a string of well-received productions. Their new albeit traditional <a href="Gibbon%27s%20Tennis%20Court">theatre in Vere Street</a> was already fully operational. The devoted playgoer <a href="Samuel%20Pepys">Samuel Pepys</a> called it "the finest playhouse... that ever was in England" in his diary, a sentiment he would need to revise many times over the coming decade, and recorded his awe at seeing Michael Mohun, "who is said to be the best actor in the world", act on its stage. Davenant was far behind, but daringly put all his capital into the outfitting of a new superior <a href="Lisle%27s%20Tennis%20Court">playhouse in Lincoln's Inn Fields</a> (simultaneously, with great foresight, prying loose the rising young star <a href="Thomas%20Betterton">Thomas Betterton</a> from the King's Company), and perfectly hit public taste.

Lincoln's Inn Fields opened on 28 June 1661, with the first "moveable" or "changeable" <a href="theatrical%20scenery">scenery</a> used on the British public stage, i.e. <a href="Stage%20%28theatre%29%23Proscenium%20stage">wings</a> or "shutters" that ran in grooves and could be smoothly and mechanically changed between or even within acts. The production was a revamped version of Davenant's own five-year-old opera "The Siege of Rhodes". It is not known who painted the scenes or shutters, or whether continental craftsmen were responsible for the technical construction, but the result was such a sensation that it brought Charles II to a public theatre for the first time. The competing King's Company suddenly found itself playing to empty houses, as Pepys notes on 4 July:
I went to the theatre [in Vere Street] and there I saw "Claracilla" (the first time I ever saw it), well acted. But strange to see this house, that use to be so thronged, now empty since the opera begun—and so will continue for a while I believe.
"The Siege of Rhodes" "continued acting 12 days without interruption with great applause" according to the prompter <a href="John%20Downes%20%2817th-century%20prompter%29">John Downes</a> in his "historical review of the stage" "<a href="Roscius%20Anglicanus">Roscius Anglicanus</a>" (1708). This was a remarkable run for the limited potential audience of the time. As four more acclaimed Duke's Company productions "with scenes" followed at Lincoln's Inn Fields in the course of 1661 (including "<a href="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>"), all highly admired by Pepys, the King's Company had no other recourse than to hastily commission a changeable-scenery playhouse of their own. Bowing to the inevitable just seven months after the opening of Lincoln's Inn Fields, Killigrew and his actors signed orders for a new, even more magnificent, theatre in Bridges Street. This theatre, the first step in the war of <a href="spectacle">spectacle</a> escalation of the 1660s, was so full when Pepys and his wife went to see an opera there that "they told us we could have no room". The large, yet compact, Restoration playhouses, with audience capacities from 700 (Bridges Street) to upwards of 2,000 (the next house on the same site, the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Theatre Royal, Drury Lane</a>, finished in 1674), were enormous investments, financed through selling shares in the companies, which were thus bound to make more and more money from ticket sales. Not only the theatres and their technical equipment, but the flats painted for a single performance, the special effects, and the elaborate stage clothes, were extremely expensive. Audiences appreciated both luxury and appropriateness of décor and costume: Pepys was quite capable of going several times to see a play that, as such, he disliked, purely for the pleasure of viewing striking and innovative scenery like "a good scene of a town on fire". The companies struggled to outdo each other in catering to these expensive tastes, with precarious finances and the ever-present consciousness that the investments could literally burn to the ground in a few hours. When the theatre in Bridges Street did burn down in January 1672, with its entire stock of scenery and costumes, it was an economic blow from which the King's Company's never recovered.

The Duke's Company, operating smoothly under what soon became Davenant's and Thomas Betterton's joint management, consistently led the way while the King's lagged further and further behind, moving only in forced response and suffering from chronic management conflict between Killigrew and powerful actor shareholders like Michael Mohun and <a href="Charles%20Hart%20%2817th-century%20actor%29">Charles Hart</a>, who insisted on actor-centred "talk" drama. The difference can be traced in Pepys' regular preference for performances at the Duke's, and in his ever-renewed admiration for Betterton's acting. In December 1667, the King's Company even ceased acting for some days because of a quarrel between Mohun and Hart. With the escalation of expense, days with zero takings were a very serious matter. The crowning grand investment of the Duke's Company was totally beyond the King's means to respond to: the "machine house" at Dorset Garden.

An era came to an end in 1668 with two events: Davenant died suddenly, leaving a messy ownership situation for the Duke's Company, and Pepys' eyesight forced him to stop keeping a diary. Thomas Betterton, though formally a minority shareholder, continued to run the Duke's Company, and, in the spirit of Davenant, commissioned the most elaborate of the Restoration playhouses, the theatre at Dorset Garden (or Dorset Gardens), with a flat for himself on top. Although the <a href="Dorset%20Garden%20Theatre">Dorset Garden Theatre</a> quickly became a famous and glamorous venue, very little is concretely known about the building and outfitting of it: a vague and undocumented tradition ascribes its design to <a href="Christopher%20Wren">Christopher Wren</a>. The absence of Pepys' record means that performance data for the next decades are only patchily known.

The machines at Dorset Garden and several of the most flamboyant production concepts realised through them were strongly influenced by the French opera and "tragédie en machines". Paris was home to the most elaborate visual and musical stage productions in Europe, and Betterton travelled to Paris in the summer of 1671 to learn from the sensation of the season, the "comédie-ballet" "<a href="Psych%C3%A9%20%28play%29">Psyché</a>" by <a href="Moli%C3%A8re">Molière</a>, <a href="Pierre%20Corneille">Corneille</a>, and <a href="Philippe%20Quinault">Quinault</a>, to music by <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Lully">Lully</a>. "For several things concerning the decoration of the play, I am obliged to the French", acknowledged Thomas Shadwell in the introduction to his own "<a href="Psyche%20%28Locke%29">Psyche</a>" in 1674. Even more directly influential were the French operatic visits to London, which sparked off a new interest in opera proper in London audiences. In a brilliant move, the King's Company, all but bankrupt after the crushing blow of the fire in Bridges Street, invited the French musician <a href="Robert%20Cambert">Robert Cambert</a> to perform his opera "Ariadne" as one of the first productions at their new playhouse in Drury Lane. The Duke's Company responded to the visual gorgeousness of this guest appearance with a Shakespearean <a href="extravaganza">extravaganza</a> at Dorset Garden: Shadwell's adaptation of Davenant's and Dryden's version of Shakespeare's "<a href="The%20Tempest%20%28play%29">Tempest</a>", a piece designed to show off the new machinery:
The Front of the Stage is open'd, and the Band of 24 Violins, with the Harpsicals and Theorbo's which accompany the Voices, are plac'd between the Pit and the Stage. While the Overture is playing, the Curtain rises, and discovers a new Frontispiece, joyn'd to the great Pylasters, on each side of the Stage... Behind this is the Scene, which represents a thick Cloudy Sky, a very Rocky Coast, and a Tempestuous Sea in perpetual Agitation. This Tempest (suppos'd to be rais'd by Magick) has many dreadful Objects in it, as several Spirits in horrid shapes flying down amongst the Sailers, then rising and crossing in the Air. And when the Ship is sinking, the whole House is darken'd, and a shower of Fire falls upon 'em. This is accompanied with Lightning, and several Claps of Thunder, to the end of the Storm.
This multiplication of effects at the very outset of the play served as a shock and foretaste of what the audience would find farther along.

The technical capacities of Dorset Garden were little used for <a href="Restoration%20comedy">Restoration comedy</a>, and, while most <a href="heroic%20drama">heroic drama</a> included some scenes that showed off the perspective stage or used some of the simpler machines, spectacle on this limited scale could be just as well staged at Drury Lane. The plays for which Dorset Garden was built, the "machine plays" of the 1670s and 1680s and the operas of the 1690s, were a category to themselves, different from ordinary serious drama: more static, more mythological, much more gorgeous, infinitely more expensive. So elaborate was the scale of these productions, and so long each preparation time, that only five "machine plays" were produced during the 1670s; yet they were hugely important for the finances of the Duke's Company, mostly in a positive sense. They were Davenant's version of "Macbeth" (1672–73), Settle's "Empress of Morocco" (probably 1673), Shadwell/Dryden/Davenant's "Tempest" (1673–74), Thomas Shadwell's long-awaited "Psyche" (1674–75), and Charles Davenant's "Circe" (1676–77).

"Psyche" had not one, but two, extremely elaborate sets for each of five acts. This is the setting for the beginning of Act 3:
The Scene is the Palace of Cupid, compos'd of wreath'd Columns of the Corinthian Order; the Wreathing is adorn'd with Roses, and the Columns have several little Cupids flying about 'em, and a single Cupid standing upon every Capital. At a good distance are seen three Arches, which divide the first Court from the other part of the Building: The middle Arch is noble and high, beautified with Cupids and Festoons, and supported with Columns of the foresaid Order. Through these Arches is seen another Court, that leads to the main Building, which is at a mighty distance. All the Cupids, Capitals and Inrichments of the whole Palace are of Gold. Here the Cyclops are at work at a forge, forging great Vases of Silver. The Musick strikes up, they dance, hammering the Vases upon Anvils. After the Dance, Enter "Vulcan".
(The gold cupids on the columns are due to come to life and jump off.) The use of perspective scenery and many arches is evident here, creating an illusion of the first court being "at a good distance" and the next "at a mighty distance". This creation of fake depth was a favourite device, repeated when the scene changed halfway through the act:
The scene changes to the principal street of the city, with vast numbers of people looking down from the tops of houses, and out of the windows and balconies, which are hung with tapestry. In this street is a large triumphal arch, with columns of the Doric order, adorned with the statues of Fame and Honour, &c. beautified with festoons of flowers; all the enrichments of gold. Through this arch, at a vast distance, in the middle of a piazza, is seen a stately obelisk.
The numbers of performers used, mainly dancers, is clearly staggering compared to the regular comedy or serious play, where the norm was something like 10–15 actors plus a few extras. Although actual numbers are generally vague in these mass scene stage directions, dance scenes like that of the cyclops, and all the cupids who will join them on the floor minutes later, rely on coordination, choreography, and generous collective effects. Of course the many highly paid dancers would be busy in many roles, returning as townspeople after the scene change of Act 3 with most of the gold paint hastily washed off, and entranced looking upwards to see "Mars and Venus meet in the air in their chariots, his drawn by horses, and hers by doves".

Each production was a gamble. The aspect of the machine plays that posterity knows most about is their economics, as this was what the old prompter Downes most vividly recalled when he wrote his "<a href="Roscius%20Anglicanus">Roscius Anglicanus</a>" in 1708. The scenery alone for "Psyche" cost more than £800, which can be related to the entire annual box office takings for the company of £10,000. Ticket prices for these performances would be raised to up to four times normal. Both "Psyche" and "The Tempest" actually complained of the production costs in their epilogues, hinting pointedly that the public ought to reward the "poor players" for their risk-taking and for offering splendours that had so far been reserved for royal masques:

The audience apparently agreed, transfixed by such sights as Venus ascending into the heavens and "being almost lost in the clouds", whereupon "Cupid flies up and gets into her chariot, and brings her back", followed by <a href="Jupiter%20%28god%29">Jupiter</a> appearing on a flying eagle. "Psyche" turned out highly profitable. It is altogether a pattern that the 1670s productions did make money, while those of the 1680s and 1690s barely broke even or were actual economic disasters.

Even after the King's Company got their new well-appointed playhouse in Drury Lane in 1674, they could not take full advantage of it, as they lacked the capital to mount competitive spectaculars. Instead, they attempted to simultaneously capitalise on and snipe at the Duke's most successful mid-1670s offerings by mounting several <a href="burlesque">burlesque</a>s or <a href="parody">parodies</a> of them, written by <a href="Thomas%20Duffett">Thomas Duffett</a>. The records for the mid-1670s are particularly incomplete, and neither exact dates nor the public reaction to Duffett's pieces are known, but even the printed versions, pale shadows of Duffett's travesty spectacles, have proved highly amusing to modern critics. The first of them, "The Empress of Morocco", caricatured simultaneously Settle's "Empress of Morocco" and the sumptuous new Dorset Garden production of Davenant's "<a href="Macbeth">Macbeth</a>" adaptation, with Duffett's three witches flying in over the pit on brooms at the high point of the action, followed by the descent of Heccate over the Stage "in a glorious chariot, adorned with pictures of hell and devils, and made of a large wicker basket". "The Mock Tempest" improves on the shower of fire over the audience in the Dorset Garden pseudo-Shakespearean tempest scene with a rain of "fire, apples, nuts".

There was no investment in spectaculars during the political unrest of 1678–84 with the <a href="Popish%20Plot">Popish Plot</a> and the <a href="Exclusion%20Crisis">Exclusion Crisis</a>, lean years for theatre. In 1682, the companies merged, making Dorset Garden's technical resources available to Dryden, who rapidly got over his principled objection to the superficiality of "spectacle" and "empty operas". The orgy of machinery and extravagant visuals that he went on to write, "<a href="Albion%20and%20Albanius">Albion and Albanius</a>" (1684–85), is quoted in the "Introductory" section, with the cave of <a href="Proteus">Proteus</a> rising out of the sea. Here is <a href="Juno%20%28mythology%29">Juno</a> in her flying peacock machine:
The Clouds divide, and JUNO appears in a Machine drawn by Peacocks; while a Symphony is playing, it moves gently forward, and as it descends, it opens and discovers the Tail of the Peacock, which is so large, that it almost fills the opening of the Stage between Scene and Scene.
Unusual visual allegory in this <a href="Tory">Tory</a> <a href="panegyric">panegyric</a> of Charles II and the <a href="House%20of%20Stuart">House of Stuart</a> includes a figure representing the radical <a href="British%20Whig%20Party">Whig</a> leader <a href="Anthony%20Ashley-Cooper%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Shaftesbury">Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury</a> "with fiend's wings, and snakes twisted round his body; he is encompassed by several fanatical rebellious heads, who suck poison from him, which runs out of a tap in his side." In an investor's nightmare, while Dryden's propaganda piece was in preparation, Charles II died, <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James II</a> succeeded him, and the <a href="Monmouth%20Rebellion">Monmouth Rebellion</a> which Shaftesbury had fomented broke out. On the very day of the premiere, June 3, 1685, the <a href="James%20Scott%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Monmouth">Duke of Monmouth</a> landed in the west. "The nation being in a great consternation", recollected Downes, "it was performed but six times, which not answering half the charge they were at, involved the company very much in debt." This traumatic fiasco ruled out all further operatic spectacle investment until the calmer times after the <a href="Glorious%20Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a> of 1689.

While the monopoly United Company's takings were being bled off by Davenant's shyster sons, one of whom, <a href="Alexander%20Davenant">Alexander</a>, was forced to flee the country in 1693 and other predatory investors, Thomas Betterton continued to act as de facto day-to-day manager and producer, enjoying a budget on the scale of <a href="Cecil%20B.%20DeMille">Cecil B. DeMille</a>. In the early 1690s, he staged the three real operas of the Restoration spectacular genre, or the shows usually so designated: "<a href="Dioclesian">Dioclesian</a>" (1689–90) by <a href="Philip%20Massinger">Massinger</a>/<a href="John%20Fletcher%20%28playwright%29">Fletcher</a>/Betterton; "<a href="King%20Arthur%20%28opera%29">King Arthur</a>" (1690–91) by John Dryden; and "<a href="The%20Fairy-Queen">The Fairy-Queen</a>" (1691–92), adapted from Shakespeare's "<a href="A%20Midsummer%20Night%27s%20Dream">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a>" by perhaps Elkanah Settle, all of them graced by music by <a href="Henry%20Purcell">Henry Purcell</a>, and together perhaps a sign of the coming 18th-century vogue for <a href="Italian%20opera">Italian opera</a>. The lavish variety entertainment "Dioclesian", adapted by Betterton, with many monsters, dragons, and machines, from Massinger and Fletcher's "History of Dioclesian", was very popular throughout the 1690s and made a lot of money for the United Company. So did Dryden's much more serious "King Arthur", the first operatic entertainment that Hume is prepared to consider an artistic success, with Purcell's marvellous music a major part of the entertainment and the songs "for once well integrated into the play".

At the very end of its history, the economics of the Restoration spectacular spiralled out of control with the magnificent production of "The Fairy Queen" in the 1691–92 season. It was a great popular success, but so stuffed with special effects and so expensive that it nevertheless proved impossible to make money from it. As Downes recalls: "Though the court and town were wonderfully satisfied with it ... the expenses in setting it out being so great, the company got little by it." Its twelve-foot-high working fountain and six dancing real live monkeys have become notorious in theatre history.

The spectacular play died out with the Restoration period, but spectacle would continue on the English stage as the splendours of Italian <a href="grand%20opera">grand opera</a> hit London in the early 18th century. The dangerous Restoration economic spiral of the ever-more-expensive machine plays would teach 18th- and 19th-century theatrical entrepreneurs to dispense with playwrighting altogether and minimise the cast, utilising any number of surprising effects and scenes in the <a href="dumbshow">dumbshow</a> of <a href="pantomime">pantomime</a> and <a href="Harlequin">Harlequin</a>, without attendant costs in music, dramatists, and cast.

There have been a small number of attempts to resurrect the Restoration spectacular as a background to modern cinema: <a href="Terry%20Gilliam">Terry Gilliam</a>'s "<a href="The%20Adventures%20of%20Baron%20Munchausen">The Adventures of Baron Munchausen</a>" features at its start perhaps the most accurate reconstruction, with painted scenery, mechanisms and lighting effects typical of the period.

The Last Temptation of Krust

"The Last Temptation of Krust" is the fifteenth episode of "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>" <a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%209%29">ninth season</a>. It first aired on the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox network</a> in the United States on February 22, 1998. It was written by <a href="Donick%20Cary">Donick Cary</a> and directed by <a href="Mike%20B.%20Anderson">Mike B. Anderson</a>. Comedian <a href="Jay%20Leno">Jay Leno</a> makes a guest appearance. In the episode, <a href="Bart%20Simpson">Bart</a> convinces <a href="Krusty%20the%20Clown">Krusty the Clown</a> to appear at a comedy festival organized by Jay Leno, but Krusty's old material does not go over well with the audience and he receives bad reviews. He briefly retires from comedy but returns with a new, better-received gimmick. He soon returns to his old ways, selling out to a motor-vehicle company.

The production team's decision to write an episode about stand-up comedy was influenced by comedy festivals. The writing staff initially had trouble getting Krusty's offensive bad jokes through network censors, but convinced them this was simply a way to emphasize his old and dated comedic material. The "Canyonero" sequence was modeled after <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford</a> commercials and was given its own segment at the end of the episode because the production staff liked it so much. The episode was highlighted by "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" in a review of <a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%209%29">"The Simpsons" ninth season</a> and received positive reviews in "<a href="The%20Washington%20Times">The Washington Times</a>", the "<a href="Evening%20Herald">Evening Herald</a>", and in books on "The Simpsons".

Krusty is persuaded by Bart to appear at a comedy festival organized by Jay Leno. His old-fashioned and outdated material fails to impress the audience when compared with the more trendy <a href="comedian">comedian</a>s also appearing. After reading a critical review of his act in the press, Krusty decides to go on a "bender to end all benders" and a montage sequence shows him getting drunk. After Bart finds him passed out on <a href="Ned%20Flanders">Ned Flanders</a>' lawn, he enlists the help of Leno to clean him up. Krusty holds a press conference to announce his retirement and in short order launches into a bitter tirade against modern-day comedians. The audience finds Krusty's rant hysterically funny and he subsequently announces his return to comedy.

Krusty is inspired to return to doing low-key events, where he structures a new image for himself as a <a href="stand-up%20comedy">stand-up comedian</a> who tells the truth, criticizes commercialism, and refuses to <a href="sell%20out">sell out</a> to corporate America. He also changes his appearance, sporting a dark sweater and tying his hair in a ponytail. Observing his newfound popularity, two marketing executives try to persuade Krusty to endorse a new <a href="sport%20utility%20vehicle">sport utility vehicle</a> called the Canyonero. Although he tries to resist, he eventually succumbs to the lure of money. After promoting the Canyonero at a comedy performance in <a href="Moe%27s%20Tavern">Moe's Tavern</a>, he is booed off stage by the patrons. He finally admits to himself that comedy is not in his blood and selling out is. The episode ends with an extended advertisement for the Canyonero, as Krusty and Bart leave <a href="Moe%20Szyslak">Moe</a>'s tavern in Krusty's new SUV.

In the <a href="DVD">DVD</a> commentary for "The Simpsons' " ninth season, writer <a href="Donick%20Cary">Donick Cary</a> stated that the inspiration for the idea of an episode about stand-up comedy came out of comedy festivals at the time. Executive producer <a href="Mike%20Scully">Mike Scully</a> said that the writers had difficulty getting Krusty's offensive bad jokes through the network censors. The stereotypical jokes were allowed because the writers convinced the network censors that viewers would understand it was simply emphasizing Krusty's dated comedic material.

<a href="Mike%20B.%20Anderson">Mike B. Anderson</a> stated that at least three different acts of material were written and animated for Krusty's comeback stand-up appearance at Moe's Tavern. It was not until the editing process that the material used was decided upon. The episode was still being animated three weeks before it was due to air and the production process moved frantically shortly before completion. The Canyonero sequence was originally planned to be displayed during the closing credits. The production team liked the scene so much that they did not want it to be obscured by the credits and gave it its own segment at the end of the episode.

In addition to Jay Leno, other real-life comedians that portrayed themselves in the episode include <a href="Steven%20Wright">Steven Wright</a>, <a href="Janeane%20Garofalo">Janeane Garofalo</a>, <a href="Bobcat%20Goldthwait">Bobcat Goldthwait</a>, and <a href="Bruce%20Baum">Bruce Baum</a>, whose appearance helped increase his popularity. Krusty's "Krustylu Studios" is a spoof on the company <a href="Desilu%20Productions">Desilu</a> studios, set up by <a href="Lucille%20Ball">Lucille Ball</a> and her husband <a href="Desi%20Arnaz">Desi Arnaz</a>, where the series "<a href="Star%20Trek">Star Trek</a>" was once filmed. During Krusty's "bender to end all benders" <a href="Montage%20sequence">montage</a>, he is seen drinking out of and vomiting into the <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a>. The <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a> sent a letter regarding this scene. Mike Scully described it as a "kind of a cease and desist", but the production staff decided not to cut the scene from the episode. Krusty attends the coffee shop Java the Hut, a reference to the "<a href="Star%20Wars">Star Wars</a>" character <a href="Jabba%20the%20Hutt">Jabba the Hutt</a>. Additionally, Krusty's anti-commercialism and anti-corporate stances, along with styling his hair in a ponytail, is a reference to comedian <a href="George%20Carlin">George Carlin</a> who styled his hair the same way later in his career and often had anti-capitalism, anti-consumerism and anti-commercialism overtones in his performance.

The "Canyonero" song and visual sequence was modeled after <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford</a> commercials. The sequence is a parody of a commercial for a sport utility vehicle and <a href="Hank%20Williams%20Jr.">Hank Williams Jr.</a> sings a song about the Canyonero accompanied by <a href="Country%20music">country guitar music</a> and whip cracks. The song "Canyonero" closely resembles the theme to the 1960s television series "<a href="Rawhide%20%28TV%20series%29">Rawhide</a>". This episode was the first appearance of the Canyonero, which again appeared in the <a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%2010%29">season 10</a> episode "". The "Canyonero" song is included on the 1999 soundtrack album "<a href="Go%20Simpsonic%20with%20The%20Simpsons">Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons</a>".

<a href="Chris%20Turner%20%28author%29">Chris Turner</a> wrote positively of the Canyonero spoof piece in "<a href="Planet%20Simpson">Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Defined a Generation</a>", calling it "a brilliant parody of an SUV ad". In an article in the journal "Environmental Politics" Steve Vanderheiden commented that the Canyonero reflected an "anti-SUV" stance by "The Simpsons". Vanderheiden wrote: "Even the popular animated television series ‘The Simpsons’ joined the anti-SUV fray in 1998, featuring a mammoth vehicle called the ‘Canyonero’ (marketed with the jingle: ‘Twelve yards long, two lanes wide/Sixty-five tons of American pride!’), which promised to help the family transcend its mundane station-wagon existence but instead brought only misery." The term "Canyonero" has since been used in the news media to refer critically to large trucks and SUVs. In an article in the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" about SUV owners, Vicki Haddock wrote "SUV owners have become something of a punch line, succinctly captured in a "Simpsons" parody touting the apocryphal Canyonero". In a 2006 article, Seth Jayson of "<a href="Motley%20Fool">The Motley Fool</a>" compared the wording in a Ford advertisement "myFord Owner Magazine" to this episode, writing: "the unholiest of unholies is the writing, which is so thick with absurd adspeak, you'd think it was written by the crew at "The Onion" or "The Simpsons" – especially that episode where Krusty starts shilling for the Canyonero." In a 2004 article in the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>", Jim Mateja noted that people have pointed out a similarity between the <a href="GMC%20Canyon">GMC Canyon</a> and the Canyonero. When contacted, GMC responded that the GMC is a pickup truck, while the Canyonero is a parody of an SUV. Joshua Dowling of "<a href="The%20Sun-Herald">The Sun-Herald</a>" described the philosophy of the <a href="Ford%20Super%20Duty">Ford F-250</a> as "The Canyonero comes to life".

In its original broadcast, "The Last Temptation of Krust" finished 21st in ratings for the week of February 16–23, 1998, with a <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen rating</a> of 9.7, equivalent to approximately 9.5 million viewing households. It was the fourth highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following "<a href="The%20X-Files">The X-Files</a>", "<a href="World%27s%20Wildest%20Police%20Videos">The World's Scariest Police Chases</a>", and "<a href="King%20of%20the%20Hill">King of the Hill</a>".

In 2006, "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" highlighted the episode in a review of <a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%209%29">"The Simpsons" ninth season</a>. In his review of the season nine DVD, Joseph Szadkowski of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Times">The Washington Times</a>" noted: "Among the 22-minute gems found in the set, I most enjoyed ... [Krusty's] work with Jay Leno." Mark Evans of the "<a href="Evening%20Herald">Evening Herald</a>" wrote: "'The Last Temptation of Krust' is a winner for its title alone as Krusty the clown becomes a satiric 'alternative' comedian but then sells out by advertising the Canyonero SUV road hazard." <a href="Alan%20Sepinwall">Alan Sepinwall</a> wrote positively of the episode in "<a href="The%20Star-Ledger">The Star-Ledger</a>", citing the Canyonero sequence as "the real reason to watch" the episode and that "It's an oversize vehicle that will create oversized laughs." Some sources mistakenly refer to this episode as "The Last Temptation of Krusty".

In the book "I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood characterized the episode as "a good twist on the never-ending Krusty story" and suggested that while "Jay Leno turns in a nice cameo [...] the show is stolen by the advert for the Canyonero". The authors also praised Krusty's "ponytail and black sweater" look. In the DVD <a href="audio%20commentary">audio commentary</a> for "The Last Temptation of Krust", Leno said that he believed the essence of comedy clubs was depicted very well in the episode and referred to Krusty's remodeled appearance as "<a href="George%20Carlin">[George] Carlin</a> post-Vegas act". He also appreciated Krusty's poke at Leno's use of news headlines on "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno" and said that he could not figure out whether parts of the episode were making fun of him or complimenting him. William Irwin's "" references a scene from the episode as an example of Marge's <a href="Nonviolent%20resistance">passive resistance</a>, her <a href="morality">moral influence</a> on Lisa, and her value as a <a href="role%20model">role model</a> for her children.

Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge

The Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge, which stood from 1855 to 1897 across the <a href="Niagara%20River">Niagara River</a>, was the world's first working railway <a href="suspension%20bridge">suspension bridge</a>. It spanned and stood downstream of <a href="Niagara%20Falls">Niagara Falls</a>, where it connected <a href="Niagara%20Falls%2C%20Ontario">Niagara Falls, Ontario</a>, to <a href="Niagara%20Falls%2C%20New%20York">Niagara Falls, New York</a>. Trains used the upper of its two decks, pedestrians and carriages the lower. The brainchild of Canadian politicians, the bridge was built by one American and one Canadian company. It was most commonly called the Suspension Bridge; other names included Niagara Railway Suspension Bridge, Niagara Suspension Bridge, and its official American name, the International Suspension Bridge.

The bridge was part of Canadian politician <a href="William%20Hamilton%20Merritt">William Hamilton Merritt</a>'s vision to promote trade within his country and with its neighbor the United States. Many, including bridge builders, argued that a suspension bridge could not allow the safe passage of trains. Nonetheless, the bridge companies hired <a href="Charles%20Ellet%2C%20Jr.">Charles Ellet, Jr.</a>, who laid a line by a <a href="kite">kite</a> across the chasm and built a temporary suspension bridge in 1848. Ellet left the project after a financial dispute with the bridge companies, who hired <a href="John%20A.%20Roebling">John Augustus Roebling</a> to complete the project. By 1854, his bridge was nearly complete, and the lower deck was opened for pedestrian and carriage travel. On March 18, 1855, a fully laden passenger train officially opened the completed bridge.

A border crossing between Canada and the United States, the Suspension Bridge played significant roles in the histories of the Niagara region and the two countries. Three railway lines crossed over the bridge, connecting cities on both sides of the border. The <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway%20%28Ontario%29">Great Western Railway</a>, <a href="New%20York%20Central%20Railroad">New York Central Railroad</a>, and <a href="Erie%20Railroad">New York and Erie Rail Road</a> differed in the <a href="track%20gauge">track gauge</a>; the bridge used a <a href="Dual%20gauge%23Triple%20gauge">triple gauge system</a> to conserve space, overlapping two tracks on top of each other and using a rail of each to form the third track. The railroads brought a large influx of trade and tourists into the region around the Niagara Falls. In the time leading to the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, the <a href="Underground%20Railroad">Underground Railroad</a> helped slaves in the United States escape across the Suspension Bridge to freedom in Canada. After the war, the bridge became a symbol of inspiration to Americans, encouraging them to rebuild their country and pushing them to quickly industrialize their nation.

The bridge's success proved that a railway suspension bridge could be safe and operational. Slowly decaying, the bridge's wooden structures were replaced with stronger steel and iron versions by 1886. Heavier trains required its replacement by the Steel Arch Bridge, later renamed the <a href="Whirlpool%20Rapids%20Bridge">Whirlpool Rapids Bridge</a>, on August 27, 1897.

In the mid-19th century, the hinterlands of the North American East Coast opened up rapidly. In Canada, entrepreneur and politician <a href="William%20Hamilton%20Merritt">William Hamilton Merritt</a> helped establish several trade routes, especially in dredged waterways between the lake cities. He also envisioned a U.S. and Canadian rail network to connect the Atlantic coast with new territories in the West, and this led to a railway <a href="suspension%20bridge">suspension bridge</a> across the <a href="Niagara%20River">Niagara River</a> below the falls.
Merritt's vision for the Niagara Suspension Bridge was conceived at the Niagara River itself. In summer 1844 while taking a picnic on the river shores, near what was then the town of <a href="Clifton%20Hill%20%28Niagara%20Falls%29">Clifton</a>, Merritt read a letter from his sons to his wife. The younger Merritts were touring Europe and visited the town of <a href="Fribourg">Fribourg</a>, Switzerland. Amazed by the Freiburg Suspension Bridge, they wrote to their parents, describing the wonders of the bridge in eloquent terms. Their writing had a profound effect on their parents, and the elder Merritts wondered if such a suspension bridge could be built across the Niagara. Merritt was driven to realize that vision, and he approached the relevant authorities, including the Queen of England, for permission to start the construction of the suspension bridge. His efforts were rewarded in 1846; the state of New York and the government of Canada approved the charters to form the Niagara Falls International Bridge Company and the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge Company, respectively.

In the years before the first bridge was built over the Niagara River, the river was crossed entirely by boats. Powered by steam engines, vessels ferried people and carriages across the raging river at calmer points of the water. One of these vessels was the "<a href="Maid%20of%20the%20Mist">Maid of the Mist</a>", the first tourist boat to ply the waters of the Niagara River. Named after a local legend, the steamer began service in 1846. Launching from a point below the <a href="Horseshoe%20Falls">Horseshoe Falls</a>, it chugged up to the base of the falls, offering a close-up view of the natural wonder to its passengers, before moving to the opposite shore. The site for the Suspension Bridge was half a mile (0.8 km) from the "Maid of the Mist"s landings. The selection of the bridge site was based more on aesthetics than technical ease; it was the narrowest point of the gorge— across and deep—that allowed a full view of the falls from the American side.

After the bridge companies were founded, they invited engineers to submit plans and cost estimates for a suspension bridge that carried a railway. The invitation was met with skepticism among the engineering community. At that time, there was not a suspension bridge that could allow a train to pass over it safely. While the Europeans were erecting suspension bridges by the hundreds, the Americans mostly ignored them out of safety concerns; in 1831 Sir <a href="Samuel%20Brown%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Samuel Brown</a>'s <a href="Broughton%20Suspension%20Bridge">Broughton Suspension Bridge</a> in Britain had collapsed under the marching feet of a troop of soldiers, sending those on its deck into the <a href="River%20Irwell">River Irwell</a>. Furthermore, many American bridges had collapsed without experiencing weight and pressure equivalent to railroad traffic, and American engineers feared that any railway bridge would likely fail—especially a suspension bridge.

Four engineers responded: <a href="Edward%20W.%20Serrell">Edward Serrell</a>, Samuel Keefer, <a href="Charles%20Ellet%2C%20Jr.">Charles Ellet, Jr.</a>, and <a href="John%20A.%20Roebling">John Augustus Roebling</a>. All submitted designs for a suspension bridge. At the time of the bidding, Ellet and Roebling were acknowledged as masters of suspension bridge building in America. Roebling submitted two designs, a conservative single-deck suspension bridge and a double-decked version, both with meticulous calculations and drawings. Instead of relying solely on submissions, Charles Ellet, Jr. took a proactive approach. When he got wind of the project in 1845, he wrote to <a href="Charles%20B.%20Stuart">Charles B. Stuart</a>, chief engineer of the <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway%20%28Ontario%29">Great Western Railway</a>, boldly proclaiming that he could build a bridge for any likely purpose across the Niagara. After the charters had been obtained, Ellet helped Stuart to sell the bridge companies' stock and offered to buy <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>30,000 worth of stock himself. His efforts earned him the $190,000 bridge contract on November 9, 1847.

While growing up on a farm in Pennsylvania, Charles Ellet, Jr. scraped through odd jobs, but saved enough money to finance an education at the <a href="%C3%89cole%20nationale%20des%20Ponts%20et%20Chauss%C3%A9es">École nationale des Ponts et Chaussées</a> in France. After attending four months of lectures, he toured Europe before returning to the United States as the only native-born American with European education in engineering. Ellet announced his ambitions to build suspension bridges in his country of birth by proposing to span the <a href="Potomac%20River">Potomac River</a> with one. His proposal was ignored; few were willing to heed a young, inexperienced and impetuous engineer. To gain experience, Ellet started to work on railroads and canals, and later became the chief engineer on the <a href="James%20River%20and%20Kanawha%20Canal">James River and Kanawha Canal</a> project. He further improved his reputation by contributing articles about suspension bridges to respected engineering journals, such as "American Railroad Journal"; eventually, Ellet built his first suspension bridge over the <a href="Schuylkill%20River">Schuylkill River</a>, Pennsylvania, in 1842.

Ellet had the looks of an actor, which were complemented by his entertaining oratorical skills. He took advantage of these characteristics, and used showmanship and dramatics to market his proposals. These skills helped to win him attention and raise his profile both in the public and within the industry. However, his imperiousness also ruffled the feathers of people, which caused conflicts. Nonetheless, his capability to promote himself had won him the contracts for the Suspension Bridge and the later <a href="Wheeling%20Suspension%20Bridge">Wheeling Suspension Bridge</a>; the Wheeling contract was won in July 1847 while Ellet's plan for the Niagara Suspension Bridge was still in its initial stages of construction. Ellet's initial design for the bridge at Niagara placed all forms of transportation on a single deck. The <a href="Rail%20tracks">railway track</a> was in the middle of the deck, sandwiched between carriageways and footpaths on the outer sides. Moreover, trains would not go over the bridge; their cars would be disconnected from the heavy locomotives and pulled across the bridge by horses, cables, or lighter engines. Before the work could begin, Ellet faced the problem of all suspension bridge construction: getting a line across the gap.

Ellet's brainstorming sessions with his men raised several ideas that could enable a line to be suspended across the gorge; these included firing cannonballs with the line attached, towing it across the river with a steamer, and tying it to a rocket that would then be launched across the gorge. Ultimately the bridge engineer chose an idea inspired by <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>'s experiment with a <a href="kite">kite</a>. It was similar to 15th century inventor <a href="Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>'s plan to span a gap. Ellet also took the opportunity to generate publicity for his project. Organizing a kite-flying contest, he offered $5 to any boy who flew a kite across the gorge and secured the kite string to the other side. Youths from nearby towns flocked in to participate. Unlike the other boys who flew their kites from the United States side of the gorge, 16-year-old Homan Walsh crossed the river by a ferry upstream and walked to the Canadian side of the bridge site to launch his kite. He almost succeeded on his first attempt; his kite flew across but crashed just short of the shore. After resting several days at a friend's house, Walsh finally got his kite across the gorge and secured its line to a tree.
Charles Ellet and his team tied a heavier line to the kite string and pulled the joined lines across. They pulled successive heavier and stronger lines across until the final bridge cable— thick—was hanging across the gorge. The cable was suspended between two wooden towers tall, and it was attached to an iron basket. Ellet planned to use this system as a basket ferry to shuttle workers and materials across the gorge, saving time that would otherwise have been spent on land and ferry travel. Through media coverage and word-of-mouth, many people knew of Ellet's efforts and flocked to the site to watch the construction. On March 13, 1848, the system was completed, and the team planned to test it by pulling the empty basket across. They hit a snag when the basket kept getting stuck halfway and could not move ahead. Pulling back the basket, Ellet decided to assure the watching crowd that the system was workable. He stepped into the basket, and it moved towards the opposite shore. When Ellet reached the problematic spot, he spotted the issue; the basket's rollers could not pass over a portion of the cable that had been accidentally flattened during the construction. He fixed the problem and proceeded to cross to the Canadian side and back, becoming the first person to cross the gorge. Although the bridge companies had prohibited Ellet from collecting tolls, he charged each person $1.00 for the chance to "observe first hand the engineering wonder of bridging the Niagara". On some days, the basket ferry conveyed up to 125 people across the gorge.

Continuing his construction, Ellet built two footbridges and joined them together to form an wide suspension bridge. He intended to use this temporary bridge as a scaffold for the construction of the permanent railway bridge. On July 29, 1848, the bridge builder inaugurated the span in his typical manner; standing in his horse-buggy like a <a href="gladiator">gladiator</a> in his chariot, Ellet sped across the bridge, which had railings for only a third of its length at that time. His stunt garnered further publicity for the bridge, and the toll collected from the span proved lucrative; $5,000 was collected in less than a year since its official opening on August 1, 1848. Disputes arose between the bridge companies and Ellet over their shares of the money, and their relations turned bitter. The companies charged that Ellet was late in his schedule and withheld payment. Ellet retaliated by mounting cannons at the bridge to claim ownership over it. In the end the matter went to court. The bridge companies paid $10,000 to Charles Ellet, and he left the project to work full-time on the Wheeling Suspension Bridge.

The Niagara Suspension Bridge project was in hiatus for three years before the bridge companies engaged another renowned civil engineer, John Augustus Roebling, to complete it. The delay caused Roebling to miss out on the honor of building the first permanent bridge to span the Niagara; Serrell completed the <a href="Lewiston%20Suspension%20Bridge%20%281851%29">Lewiston Suspension Bridge</a> in 1851. Roebling would, however, achieve other honors in building his Niagara Railway Suspension Bridge.

Born in <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a> (later a part of Germany), John Augustus Roebling obtained his first conditional engineering degree ("Feldmesserprüfung") at <a href="Erfurt">Erfurt</a> in 1824. He attended two semesters of lessons at Berlin's <a href="Bauakademie">Bauakademie</a> and worked for the Prussian government, constructing military roads. Tired of the bureaucracy, he resigned his position and left for the United States in 1830, arriving with his brother in Philadelphia on August 6, 1831. Instead of continuing an engineering profession, he took up farming for a living. After five years he married a tailor's daughter, and had eight children with her over the next decade. Agrarian work was unsatisfactory to John Roebling, and in 1837, after the death of his brother and the birth of his first child, he returned to engineering.

Roebling first signed on as a surveyor for the Beaver River canal system, launching his career with a string of canal and railroad projects. Aside from writing articles in engineering journals, Roebling designed his own wire cables and started his own company to manufacture them; the John A. Roebling Company was the first <a href="wire%20rope">wire rope</a> manufacturer in the United States. Gradually gaining fame for his civil engineering, Roebling finally got to build suspension bridges. His first bridge was the Allegheny Suspension Aqueduct in Pittsburgh. The structure, completed in 1845, was the first suspension aqueduct in the world and the first large American suspension bridge that had multiple spans. Furthermore, it was the first suspension structure built with modern cable spinning techniques—Roebling's own invention. Earlier bridge building techniques involved fabricating the main cables at a factory, transporting them to the bridge site, and then stretching the heavy cables over the gap to erect them over the bridge. Roebling, during his experiments with wire ropes, conceived and patented a <a href="Suspension%20bridge%23Construction%20sequence%20%28wire%20strand%20cable%20type%29">new construction method</a> for these main cables. A long line—the traveler rope—formed a loop around two horizontal wheels, one on each side of the gorge. A lightweight wheel, "the traveling wheel", was attached to this line, and a wire threaded around this wheel. Like a <a href="belt%20%28mechanical%29">belt</a> in a mechanical system, the traveler rope and its wheel moved across the gap as the horizontal wheels turned, pulling the wire along. The traveling wheel effectively hauled two lengths of the same wire (running above and under the traveling wheel) across the gap at a time. The lengths of wire were collected and bound at intervals to form thicker strands, which were later compressed together into the main cables. which supported themselves and later the proportional weight of the bridge as they were formed. The method became the standard for suspension bridge construction, and remained unchanged for many years. In the 20th century, suspension bridges were still built with this pulley winding system, albeit with more sophisticated equipment.
John Roebling was a contrasting character to Charles Ellet. Whereas Ellet embellished his proposals with fanciful words and deeds, Roebling presented papers filled with meticulous calculations and drawings. The elder engineer was stern and driven to achieve, taking a scientific approach to all interests. Rarely did he show emotions in his dealings, even to his closest associates. The man, however, dared to confront his detractors and make bold exaltations about his work. He openly called European suspension bridges—including American suspension bridges built with European techniques—weak, and occasionally sniped at Ellet's and Stephenson's works. He announced that his <a href="Brooklyn%20Bridge">Brooklyn Bridge</a>, when completed, "will not only be the greatest bridge in existence, but it will be the greatest engineering work of this continent, and of the age." Roebling's history with Ellet started before the bidding for the Niagara Suspension Bridge, early in their careers. During the bidding for the Schuylkill Suspension Bridge project, Ellet had written a proposal that was published in the "American Railroad Journal". Mistakenly believing Ellet had won the contract, Roebling wrote to offer his congratulations and requested to be Ellet's assistant. He received a formal reply without any reference to his request, and his subsequent letter was ignored. When Roebling learned that a contractor had won the bid, he successfully applied to be the contractor's chief engineer. Ellet, however, persisted with his tactics and snatched the project away from the contractor; he promoted himself to the bridge company and offered to accept <a href="Lot%20%28real%20estate%29">land</a> instead of cash as payment. From then on, Ellet and Roebling became rivals, vying with each other for suspension bridge projects in North America. Roebling learned from their rivalry. His losses to Ellet showed him that he needed to promote himself and gain backers to effectively secure the contracts he desired.

When Roebling was called to the Niagara Suspension Bridge project in 1851, he had six suspension structures to his name. He found Ellet's final plan to be impractical; the bridge would have been too heavy and expensive. Roebling had another design in mind: the double-deck bridge he had proposed earlier during the bidding. The lower deck, level with the edge of the chasm, would convey passengers and carriages, and the upper deck, above, would allow fully laden trains to continue their journeys non-stop, albeit at a speed of . Roebling reasoned that the decks and sufficient <a href="truss">truss</a>es would form a rigid tube, making the bridge stiffer than a normal suspension bridge. The theory was similar to that of the <a href="tubular%20bridge">tubular bridge</a> but implemented at a lower cost. The engineering community was critical of Roebling's project. <a href="Robert%20Stephenson">Robert Stephenson</a>, builder of the tubular <a href="Britannia%20Bridge">Britannia Bridge</a>, was among those short-listed to complete the Niagara Suspension Bridge before Roebling's selection. Stephenson had submitted a design for a tubular bridge, and in 1859 he built a large and expensive tubular bridge for the <a href="Grand%20Trunk%20Railway">Grand Trunk Railway</a> at Montreal, Quebec. The bridge builder then said in derision of Roebling's suspension railway, "If your bridge succeeds, mine is a magnificent blunder."

In the face of criticism, Roebling completed the project in four years, using Ellet's bridge as scaffolding. The railway deck was stress-tested by the crossing of the steam engine "London" at a speed of on March 8, 1855. Ten days later the upper deck of the bridge was officially opened; the lower deck had been opened to the public a year earlier. As the first commercial passenger train trundled over the bridge, the two countries were finally connected by railroad across the Niagara River. The successful crossings of these and later trains made Roebling's Suspension Bridge the first working suspension railway bridge in history.

Roebling's bridge was supported by two limestone towers on each side of the gorge. These <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20architecture">Egyptian-style</a> towers stood tall on the American shore and tall on the Canadian shore. With their foundations in the earth, the limestone structures could support up to 12 million pounds (5.4 million kg). Four thick main cables held up the bridge; two cables ran through iron saddles at the top of each tower. Each cable comprised 3,059 wires that were spun with Roebling's patented technique used in his Allegheny Suspension Aqueduct. The ends of each cable were secured to cast-iron plates sunk deep in the bedrock. Support lines hung down from iron clamps that encircled the main cables, and held up the decks. Deep trusses—never before seen on a large suspension bridge—lined the sides of the bridge, and joined the two decks so that the structure looked like a cage. The trussed sides and the upper and lower decks, which spanned , formed a "hollow straight beam", reinforcing the rigidity of the bridge.

The Suspension Bridge was further stiffened by <a href="guy-wire">guy-wire</a>s which ran from its upper deck to the top of its towers. Criticism of suspension bridges was growing after the Wheeling Suspension Bridge collapsed under strong winds in 1854. To address these concerns, Roebling added more guy-wires to secure the lower deck to the shores below. Roebling's efforts ensured that his Suspension Bridge remained standing while other suspension bridges across the Niagara River collapsed because of strong winds. Although he was not the first engineer to appreciate the need for a suspension bridge to be sufficiently rigid or to implement the methods to do so, Roebling was the first to understand the principles behind the methods and combine them in the building of a suspension bridge. Roebling proved that despite popular opinion, properly built suspension bridges can safely support the passage of heavy railway traffic. The engineer's combination of stiffening methods created the first modern suspension bridge. Such was the rigidity of the Suspension Bridge that it withstood the shockwave caused by the nearby fall of a mass of rock in 1863; the force of the impact manifested itself as a wave, rippling through the decks of the bridge from the American side to the Canadian side and back.
From the United States, the <a href="Erie%20Railroad">New York and Erie Rail Road</a>'s Canandaigua and Niagara Falls Railroad and <a href="New%20York%20Central%20Railroad">New York Central Railroad</a>'s <a href="Buffalo%20and%20Niagara%20Falls%20Railroad">Buffalo and Niagara Falls Railroad</a> crossed over the bridge and reached into Ontario. Similarly, the Great Western Railway in Canada extended its network from Canada into New York. At the time of the bridge's opening, the three railroads were of different <a href="gauge%20%28railroad%29">gauge</a>s: on the New York Central, on the Great Western, and on the Erie. Instead of accommodating three railways side-by-side on a single wide deck, the bridge saved space by <a href="Dual%20gauge%23Triple%20gauge">overlapping the tracks</a> over each other. This method used only four rails; one pair formed the track for one railway, and the other pair formed another. One rail from each pair would then form the final track. In the first year of the bridge's operation, an average of 30 trains trundled across it each day. Five years later, 45 trains passed over the structure daily.

Roebling mandated that the trains be limited to a maximum speed of to ensure absolute safety. He was confident the bridge could handle faster train traffic, but he preferred a safe operation. In his tests the bridge supported a train, bending under the weight. This was within the maximum load of specified in the design of the bridge. The figure was a conservative estimate. The cables and guy-wires could support , and travel journalist Alfred J. Pairpoint commented that it was normal to see trains pass over the bridge without danger. The bridge shook whenever a train trundled over it, although this had no effect on its integrity. When the frequency of passing trains was high, the trembling was noticeable to travelers on the lower deck and proved uncomfortable to some; writer <a href="Mark%20Twain">Mark Twain</a> noted, "You drive over to Suspension Bridge and divide your misery between the chances of smashing down two hundred feet into the river below, and the chances of having a railway-train overhead smashing down onto you. Either possibility is discomforting taken by itself, but, mixed together, they amount in the aggregate to positive unhappiness." Despite such commentaries, thousands of people crossed over the bridge safely every day.
American engineers regard the Suspension Bridge as a major achievement of efficiency. In a fledgling country where resources—material and financial—were limited, they had to make do with whatever was available. This goal was espoused by the <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Civil%20Engineers">American Society of Civil Engineers</a>, which opined, "That is the best engineering, not which makes the most splendid, or even the most perfect work, but that which makes a work that answers the purpose well, at the least cost." Roebling had built a bridge that rivaled grander bridges of leading European nations at a much lower cost. His Suspension Bridge used only one-sixth the material of Stephenson's Brittania Bridge, but was twice as long and had a capacity that exceeded the tubular bridge. Moreover, the expenditure on Roebling's Suspension Bridge was $400,000, whereas a tubular bridge of equivalent length and load-bearing capability would have cost $4 million. Roebling's success established him as the master of suspension bridges. The inclined guy-wires that stretched from the top of towers to the roadway of the Suspension Bridge became the signature of his future works.

Although the Suspension Bridge proved that the suspension system could be safely used to carry railroads, no more suspension railway bridges were built. The outbreak of the American Civil War diverted attention from such civil engineering ventures, and by the time attention was paid to building bridges again, <a href="cantilever%20bridge">cantilever bridge</a>s were in vogue for railway bridges. Regardless, the Suspension Bridge's success made it a model for suspension railway bridges. When the city of Quebec called for a structure to span the <a href="St.%20Lawrence%20River">St. Lawrence River</a> in 1850, it looked to the Suspension Bridge for inspiration. Seventeen years later, the British journal "Engineering" called for a suspension railway to bridge the <a href="Straits%20of%20Messina">Straits of Messina</a> and also referred to Roebling's bridge. Lastly, Stuart opened his 1871 work on the history of American engineering, "Lives and Works of Civil and Military Engineering in America", with an illustration of the bridge.

As a border crossing between two large growing countries, the Suspension Bridge had throngs of travelers passing over it. Furthermore, it was the intersection of three major railroads. Coupled with its vicinity to a natural wonder, the Niagara Falls, the bridge brought a lot of railroad traffic into the region once it was opened. The towns at the ends of the bridge benefited greatly from this heavy movement of people and goods. The village of Suspension Bridge, United States, grew quickly within a few years after the opening of the bridge, acquiring shops, factories, and a hotel. Its tourism and commerce soon rivaled the town of <a href="Niagara%20Falls%2C%20New%20York">Niagara Falls, New York</a>; eventually, the village was merged into the town in 1892. Similarly, Clifton on the Canadian end of the bridge was integrated into the town of <a href="Niagara%20Falls%2C%20Ontario">Niagara Falls, Ontario</a>. The two Niagara Falls cities boasted commerce that surpassed neighboring settlements. Around the time of its official opening, the bridge was one of the busiest points of trade on the United States–Canada border, carrying $12 million of transitory goods and $2 million of bonded materials into Canada. To handle the large amount of goods exchanged over the border, the Lewiston customs house—the primary customs for the Niagara region—was <a href="U.S.%20Customhouse%20%28Niagara%20Falls%2C%20New%20York%29">relocated</a> to the Niagara Suspension Bridge in 1863.
The bridge's depiction as an engineering marvel and beautiful sight lured many visitors to the Falls. Travelers could, while crossing the bridge, enjoy a view of the Falls enhanced by the sensation of standing in the air. The Falls, however, proved distant and indistinct to some when there was overcast weather. On the whole, the Suspension Bridge was considered as an attraction that must be seen by visitors to Niagara Falls. In paintings and prints of the bridge, the Suspension Bridge became the focus, pushing the Falls into the background. Unlike paintings of the Falls that capture the viewer's eye with their majestic views of the natural wonder, pictures of the bridge impressed viewers with the utilitarian design of the structure. By 1897, the inbound trains to Niagara Falls brought 276,900 visitors during the months of May to August. A <a href="Tram">streetcar system</a> was established in 1882 to handle the increasing cross-border pedestrian traffic. Initially pulled by horses, the trolleys were converted to run on electricity in 1892. The Suspension Bridge was the pride and symbol of the Great Western Railway, which touted it as the "only Route via Niagara Falls & Suspension Bridge".
Travelers on the Suspension Bridge witnessed several death-defying stunts performed across the Niagara Gorge. On June 30, 1859, they saw <a href="Charles%20Blondin">Charles Blondin</a>'s feat of becoming the first man to cross the chasm on a tightrope. In mid-crossing Blondin sat down on the rope and lowered a line to retrieve a drink from the deck of the "Maid of the Mist" below. In his later tightrope acts at the same spot, the acrobat would perform a different stunt on each occasion. One time he cooked and ate an omelette in mid-crossing; another time he carried his manager Harry Colcord on his back. While giving Colcord a piggyback ride, Blondin stopped five times on the tightrope to rest and recover his strength; each time Colcord gingerly got off Blondin's back and stood on the tightrope, climbing back on after the acrobat had enough rest. Blondin's success inspired other acrobats, such as <a href="William%20Leonard%20Hunt">William Leonard Hunt</a> ("The Great Farini"), Samuel Dixon, Clifford Calverly, and Signorina <a href="Maria%20Spelterini">Maria Spelterini</a>, to emulate and try to surpass his acts at the same spot. The Signorina, the only woman to walk across the Niagara on a tightrope, once crossed while blindfolded and another time with her hands and legs in manacles.

Another group of people in America had their own risky crossings over the Niagara Gorge as they fled over the border into Canada. They were enslaved African-Americans who sought freedom by escaping to a country that declared the liberation of any slave who entered it. The bridge was part of the <a href="Underground%20Railroad">Underground Railroad</a>, a network of routes designed to smuggle slaves in the United States to freedom in Canada. Before the American Civil War, fleeing slaves had only four main routes into Canada, of which one was crossing the Niagara River. Slaves who escaped along the Niagara route had help from several quarters. The state of New York generally favored granting freedom to slaves; this attitude emboldened African-American workers in Niagara, who frequently helped slaves flee to Canada. Before the Suspension Bridge was completed, fugitives either crossed the raging river on a boat or risked their lives by swimming at calmer points of the river. The Suspension Bridge made escape across the river easier and safer, although there was still risk. To avoid getting caught and sent back to their owners, slaves had to sneak across on foot or hide aboard trains and oxcarts. Antislavery activist <a href="Harriet%20Tubman">Harriet Tubman</a> guided fugitives at night and bribed custom officials to turn a blind eye. As a result, many slaves crossed the Suspension Bridge to freedom before the United States was engulfed in civil war.

When the war ended and the United States turned its focus toward rebuilding, Roebling started building his <a href="Brooklyn%20Bridge">Brooklyn Bridge</a>. As the monumental task could affect naval navigation, it required state approval, and the government wanted a thorough review of the engineer's credentials; hence, a Bridge Party was organized. Comprising Roebling and his son, as well as their fellow bridge engineers, generals, businessmen, and high society figures, the party toured the country to review four bridges Roebling had built before the civil war. The final item on their itinerary was Roebling's Niagara Suspension Bridge. At the dinner to commemorate the end of the bridge tour, civil war veteran General <a href="Henry%20Warner%20Slocum">Henry Warner Slocum</a> gave a toast and called the Suspension Bridge a symbol of inspiration for the United States in its rebuilding efforts. This sentiment was shared by the guests and was expressed at later dinners across the United States. The achievement of building a large suspension bridge over a gorge in the face of overwhelming adversity—constant put-downs by the professional community, American and European—gave the United States a sense of pride. Nationalism rose as the country lauded the bridge. The completion of the bridge that had been deemed impossible by the Western world gave Americans, who had lesser technical accomplishments than Europe at that time, a trophy that stood above any other. The Suspension Bridge became the American symbol to brave the toughest of challenges and do the impossible, pushing their drive for industrialization even harder. <a href="Charles%20W.%20Woodman">Charles W. Woodman</a> specifically drew attention to the Suspension Bridge in his 1865 address to the United States Senate for approval to build a <a href="Patent%20slip">rail system to transport a ship</a> out of the water and up around the Niagara Falls.

Budget concerns forced Roebling to build the Suspension Bridge primarily with wood; the cost of casting the components out of iron and transporting them "[way] out West" was exorbitant. The organic material decayed and rotted because of the moisture present around Niagara Falls. As the industrialization of the United States moved forward rapidly, the introduction of the <a href="Bessemer%20process">Bessemer process</a> greatly lowered the cost of the more durable steel and iron. By 1880, the Suspension Bridge's wooden trusses, beams, and flooring were replaced with steel. The wire cables were not replaced; their cores were still in pristine condition. The outer layer of wires in the cables was, however, lightly corroded and had to be replaced. Due to severe deterioration, the limestone towers were replaced in 1886 with steel framed versions. These renovations increased the bridge's strength and helped it handle heavier loads for a few more years.
The weight of trains in North America had greatly increased by the mid-1890s. Larger and more powerful locomotives were required to pull cars that handled an increasing number of passengers and goods; compared to the locomotives crossing the bridge in the 1850s, locomotives were the common engines 40 years later. The weight of these trains exceeded the specifications of the Suspension Bridge, and the bridge companies took the opportunity to review and request the replacement of the bridge. Civil engineer <a href="Leffert%20L.%20Buck">Leffert L. Buck</a>, who had been hired to maintain the Suspension Bridge, was selected to design the replacement bridge. He settled for a bridge of the <a href="arch%20bridge">arch design</a>. At that time, arch bridges were the new models for railway bridges and were more cost-efficient than suspension bridges. Buck built the new bridge around and below the Suspension Bridge, replacing it a piece at a time. His plan allowed bridge traffic—train and pedestrian—to continue without disruption. By August 27, 1897, the last pieces of the Suspension Bridge were dismantled, leaving the Lower Steel Arch Bridge—later renamed the <a href="Whirlpool%20Rapids%20Bridge">Whirlpool Rapids Bridge</a>—in its stead. On inspection, the cores of the cables that formerly held up the Suspension Bridge were found to be as sound as on the day the bridge was built.

Zoo TV Tour

The Zoo TV Tour (also written as ZooTV, ZOO TV or ZOOTV) was a worldwide <a href="concert%20tour">concert tour</a> by <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="U2">U2</a>. Staged in support of their 1991 album "<a href="Achtung%20Baby">Achtung Baby</a>", the tour visited arenas and stadiums from 1992 to 1993. To mirror the new musical direction that the group took with "Achtung Baby", the tour was intended to deviate from their past and confound expectations of the band. In contrast to U2's austere stage setups from previous tours, the Zoo TV Tour was an elaborately staged multimedia event. It satirised television and media oversaturation by attempting to instill "<a href="sensory%20overload">sensory overload</a>" in its audience. To escape their reputation for being earnest and overly serious, U2 embraced a more lighthearted and self-deprecating image on tour. Zoo TV and "Achtung Baby" were central to the group's 1990s reinvention.

The tour's concept was inspired by disparate television programming, coverage of the <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a>, the desensitising effect of mass media, and "<a href="morning%20zoo">morning zoo</a>" radio shows. The stage featured dozens of large video screens that showed visual effects, video clips, and flashing text phrases, along with a lighting system partially made of <a href="Trabant">Trabant</a> automobiles. <a href="Channel%20surfing">Channel surfing</a>, <a href="prank%20call">prank call</a>s, video confessionals, a <a href="belly%20dance">belly dance</a>r, and live satellite link-ups to <a href="Siege%20of%20Sarajevo">war-torn Sarajevo</a> were incorporated into the shows. On stage, Bono portrayed several characters he conceived, including the leather-clad egomaniac "<a href="The%20Fly%20%28song%29">The Fly</a>", the greedy <a href="Televangelism">televangelist</a> "Mirror Ball Man", and the devilish "MacPhisto". In contrast to other U2 tours, each of the Zoo TV shows opened with six to eight consecutive new songs before older material was played.

Comprising five legs and 157 shows, the tour began in <a href="Lakeland%2C%20Florida">Lakeland, Florida</a>, on 29 February 1992 and ended in <a href="Tokyo%2C%20Japan">Tokyo, Japan</a>, on 10 December 1993. The first four legs alternated between North America and Europe, before the final leg visited Australasia and Japan. After two arena legs, the show's production was expanded for stadiums for the final three legs, which were branded "Outside Broadcast", "Zooropa", and "Zoomerang/New Zooland", respectively. Although the tour provoked a range of reactions from music critics, it was generally well received. Along with being the highest-grossing North American tour of 1992, Zoo TV sold around 5.3 million tickets over its five legs. The band's 1993 album "<a href="Zooropa">Zooropa</a>", which expanded on Zoo TV's mass media themes, was recorded during a break in the tour, and its songs were played in 1993. The tour was depicted in the <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>–winning 1994 concert film "". Critics regard the Zoo TV Tour as one of rock's most memorable tours—in 2002, "<a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">Q</a>"s Tom Doyle called it "the most spectacular rock tour staged by any band". 
U2's 1987 album "<a href="The%20Joshua%20Tree">The Joshua Tree</a>" and the supporting <a href="Joshua%20Tree%20Tour">Joshua Tree Tour</a> brought them to a new level of commercial and critical success, particularly in the United States. Like their previous tours, the Joshua Tree Tour was a minimalistic, austere production, and they used this outlet for addressing political and social concerns. As a result, the band earned a reputation for being earnest and serious, an image that became a target for derision after their much-maligned 1988 motion picture and companion album "<a href="Rattle%20and%20Hum">Rattle and Hum</a>", which documented their exploration of <a href="American%20roots%20music">American roots music</a>. The project was criticised as being "pretentious", and "misguided and bombastic", and U2 were accused of being grandiose and self-righteous. Their 1989 <a href="Lovetown%20Tour">Lovetown Tour</a> did not visit the United States, and at the end of the tour, lead vocalist <a href="Bono">Bono</a> announced on-stage that it was "the end of something for U2" and that "we have to go away and ... just dream it all up again", foreshadowing changes for the group.

U2's first ideas for Zoo TV emerged during the Lovetown Tour in 1989, when various aspects of radio programming intrigued the group, particularly the large radio audience their Dublin concerts reached. The wild antics of "<a href="morning%20zoo">morning zoo</a>" radio programmes inspired the band to consider taking a <a href="pirate%20radio">pirate radio</a> station on tour. They were also interested in using video as a way of making themselves less accessible to their audiences. The band developed these ideas in late 1990 while recording "<a href="Achtung%20Baby">Achtung Baby</a>" in Berlin at <a href="Hansa%20Studios">Hansa Studios</a>. While in Berlin, they watched television coverage of the <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a> on <a href="Sky%20News">Sky News</a>, which was the only English programming available. When they became tired of hearing about the conflict, they tuned into local programming to see "bad German soap operas" and automobile advertisements. The band believed that cable television had blurred the lines between news, entertainment, and <a href="home%20shopping">home shopping</a> over the previous decade, and they wanted to represent this on their next tour.

The juxtaposition of such disparate programming inspired U2 and "Achtung Baby" co-producer <a href="Brian%20Eno">Brian Eno</a> to conceive an "audio-visual show" that would display a rapidly changing mix of live and pre-recorded video on monitors. The idea was intended to mock the desensitising effect of mass media. Eno, who was credited in the tour programme for the "Video Staging Concept", explained his vision for the tour: "the idea to make a stage set with a lot of different video sources was mine, to make a chaos of uncoordinated material happening together... The idea of getting away from video being a way of helping people to see the band more easily ... this is video as a way of obscuring them, losing them sometimes in just a network of material."
While on a break from recording, the band invited production designer <a href="Willie%20Williams%20%28set%20designer%29">Willie Williams</a> to join them in <a href="Tenerife">Tenerife</a> in February 1991. Williams had recently worked on <a href="David%20Bowie">David Bowie</a>'s <a href="Sound%2BVision%20Tour">Sound+Vision Tour</a>, which used film projection and video content, and he was keen to "take rock show video to a level as yet undreamed of". The band played Williams some of their new music—inspired by <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a>, <a href="industrial%20music">industrial music</a>, and <a href="electronic%20dance%20music">electronic dance music</a>—and they told him about the "Zoo TV" phrase that Bono liked. Williams also learned about the band's affection for the <a href="Trabant">Trabant</a>, an East German automobile that derisively became a symbol for the <a href="fall%20of%20Communism">fall of Communism</a>. Williams thought their fondness for the car was "deeply, deeply bizarre", but nonetheless, he incorporated it into his ideas for the tour. In May, he brainstormed the idea to construct a lighting system using Trabants by hanging them from the ceiling and hollowing them to carry spotlights.

On 14 June 1991, the first tour production meeting was held, with Williams, the band, <a href="band%20manager">manager</a> <a href="Paul%20McGuinness">Paul McGuinness</a>, artist Catherine Owens, and production managers Steve Iredale and Jake Kennedy in attendance. Williams presented his ideas, which included the Trabant lighting system and the placement of video monitors all over the stage; both notions were well received. Eno's original idea was to have the video screens on wheels and constantly in motion, although this was impractical. Williams and the group proposed many ideas that did not make it to the final stage design. One such proposal, dubbed "Motorway Madness", would have placed billboards advertising real products across the stage, similar to their placement beside highways. The idea was intended to be ironic, but was ultimately scrapped out of fear that the band would be accused of <a href="selling%20out">selling out</a>. Another proposed idea building a giant doll of an "achtung baby", complete with an inflatable penis that would spray on the audience, but it was deemed too expensive and was abandoned.

By August, a prototype of a single Trabant for the lighting system was completed, with the innards gutted and retrofitted with lighting equipment, and a paint job on the exterior. Williams spent most of the second half of 1991 designing the stage. Owens was insistent that her ideas be given priority, as she thought that men had been making all of U2's creative decisions and were using male-centred designs. With bassist <a href="Adam%20Clayton">Adam Clayton</a>'s support, she recruited visual artists from Europe and the United States to arrange images for use on the display screens. These people included video artist <a href="Mark%20Pellington">Mark Pellington</a>, photo/conceptual artist <a href="David%20Wojnarowicz">David Wojnarowicz</a>, and satirical group <a href="Emergency%20Broadcast%20Network">Emergency Broadcast Network</a>, who digitally manipulate sampled image and sound. Pellington envisaged a collection of text phrases into the visual displays, inspired by his working with artist <a href="Jenny%20Holzer">Jenny Holzer</a>. The idea was first put into practice in the video for "Achtung Baby"s lead single, "<a href="The%20Fly%20%28song%29">The Fly</a>". Bono devised and collected numerous phrases during development of the album and the tour. Additional pre-recorded video content was created by Eno, Williams, <a href="Kevin%20Godley">Kevin Godley</a>, Carol Dodds, and Philip Owens.

On 13 November, U2 settled on the "Zoo TV Tour" name and the plans to place video screens across the stage and build a lighting system out of Trabants. McGuinness led a trip to East Germany to buy Trabants from a recently closed factory in <a href="Chemnitz">Chemnitz</a>, and in January 1992, Catherine Owens began to paint the cars. As she described, "The basic idea was that the imagery on the cars should have nothing to do with the car itself." One such design was the "fertility car", which sported blown-up newspaper <a href="personal%20ad">personal ad</a>s and a drawing of a woman giving birth while holding string tied to her husband's testicles. Williams and Chilean artist Rene Castro also provided artwork on the cars.

The Zoo TV stages were designed by Willie Williams, U2's stage designer since the <a href="War%20Tour">War Tour</a> of 1982–1983. In place of U2's austere and minimalist productions of the 1980s, the Zoo TV stage was a complex setup, designed to instill "<a href="sensory%20overload">sensory overload</a>" in its audience. The set's giant video screens showed not only close-ups of the band members performing, but also pre-recorded video, live television transmissions (intercepted by a satellite dish the group brought on tour), and text phrases. Electronic, tabloid-style headlines ran on scrawls at the ends of the stage. The band's embracing of such technology was meant as a radical departure in form, and as a commentary on the pervasive nature of technology. This led many critics to describe the show as "ironic".

Several versions of the stage were used during the tour. The first two legs of 1992 were indoors and used the smallest of the sets, which included four Vidiwalls (<a href="Philips">Philips</a>-branded giant television screens); six painted Trabants suspended above the stage; 36 television monitors; and a <a href="B-stage">B-stage</a>, a small remote platform connected to the main stage by a ramp. A seventh Trabant by the B-stage doubled as a <a href="deejay">DJ</a> booth and a <a href="disco%20ball">mirror ball</a>.
To redesign the set for the 1992 North American stadium leg—dubbed "Outside Broadcast"—Williams collaborated with stage designers <a href="Mark%20Fisher%20%28architect%29">Mark Fisher</a> and Jonathan Park, both of whom had worked on <a href="the%20Rolling%20Stones">the Rolling Stones</a>' <a href="Steel%20Wheels/Urban%20Jungle%20Tour">Steel Wheels Tour</a> stage set. The set was expanded to include a stage, and the Vidiwalls were supplemented by four larger mega-video screens. Williams faced difficulties in designing the outdoor lighting system, as the stage did not have a roof. He settled on using the venues' house spotlights and strategically placed lights in the structure behind the band. The spires of the stage, intended to resemble <a href="Radio%20masts%20and%20towers">transmission towers</a>, were tall enough that the <a href="Federal%20Aviation%20Administration">Federal Aviation Administration</a> required them to have blinking warning lights. The stage's appearance was compared to the techno-future cityscapes from "<a href="Blade%20Runner">Blade Runner</a>" and the works of <a href="cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a> writer <a href="William%20Gibson">William Gibson</a>. The B-stage was located at the end of a <a href="Footbridge%23Catwalk">catwalk</a>. This larger set used 176 speaker enclosures, 312  <a href="subwoofer">subwoofer</a>s, 592 mid-range speakers, 18 <a href="Video%20projector">projector</a>s, 26 on-stage microphones, two <a href="Betacam">Betacam</a> and two <a href="Video-8">Video-8</a> handheld video cameras, and 11 Trabants suspended by cranes over the stage. The outdoor stage used for the 1993 legs of the tour was smaller due to budget concerns, and it discarded the Trabants hung from cranes, instead featuring three cars hanging behind the drum kit. All of the projection screens were replaced with "video cubes", as the projectors were not bright enough for the European summer nights, when daylight remained later into the evening. The European leg featured confetti cannons, provided by Shell Shock Firework Co. and JEM, that shot "Zoo Ecu" <a href="banknotes">banknotes</a> (which were substituted by "Zooropa" <a href="condom">condom</a>s in Ireland).
To accommodate the video production, the equivalent of a <a href="Production%20control%20room">television studio control room</a>—costing US$3.5 million—was built for the tour. Beneath the stage, Dodds, the video director, operated a system custom-built by Philips called <a href="CD-i">CD-i</a>. It used five broadcast camera systems, 12 <a href="Laser%20Disc">Laser Disc</a> players, and a satellite dish, and it required 12 directors, 19 video crew members, and two separate <a href="Live%20sound%20mixing">mix stations</a> to operate. To enable each band member to perform away from their personal <a href="Foldback%20%28sound%20engineering%29">monitor speakers</a> on the main stage, sound engineers used <a href="joystick">joystick</a>s to control a <a href="Panning%20%28audio%29">panning</a> matrix for each member's <a href="in-ear%20monitor">in-ear monitor</a> as they moved around. Despite the production's complexity, the group decided that flexibility in the shows' length and content was a priority. Guitarist <a href="the%20Edge">the Edge</a> said, "That was one of the more important decisions we made early on, that we wouldn't sacrifice flexibility, so we designed a system that is both extremely complicated and high-tech but also incredibly simple and hands-on, controlled by human beings... in that sense, it's still a live performance." This flexibility allowed for improvisations and deviations from the planned programme. Eno recommended that U2 film its own video tapes so that they could be edited and looped into the video displays more easily, instead of relying entirely on pre-sequenced video. Eno explained, "their show depends on some kind of response to what's happening at the moment in that place. So if it turns out they want to do a song for five minutes longer, they can actually loop through the material again so that you're not suddenly stuck with black screens halfway through the fifth verse." The band shot new video for the displays over the course of the tour.

The 180-person crew travelled in 12 buses and a chartered jet known as the Zoo Plane. For the American stadium shows, 52 trucks were required to transport 1,200 <a href="short%20ton">short ton</a>s (1,089 <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s) of equipment, of cabling, 12 forklifts, and a crane; the million-dollar stage was constructed in a 40-hour process with the help of 200 local labourers. The sound system used over one million watts and weighed .

Rehearsals for the tour began in December 1991 at The Factory in Dublin. The band found it challenging to recreate all the sounds from the new album. They considered using additional musicians, but their sentimental attachment to a four-piece prevailed. 

The tour was announced on 13 February 1992, a little more than two weeks before opening night on 29 February at <a href="Lakeland%20Civic%20Center">Lakeland Civic Center</a> in <a href="Lakeland%2C%20Florida">Lakeland, Florida</a>. For the opening leg, 32 concerts at indoor arenas in North America were scheduled from February through April. Two days after the tour announcement, tickets for some of the shows first went on sale. While the band had toured North America every year between 1980 and 1987, they had been absent from the region's tour circuit for over four years before Zoo TV. The US concert business was in a slump at the time, and the routing of the first two legs generally allowed only one show per city. This was intended to announce the band's return to major cities, to gauge demand for ticket sales, and to re-introduce the notion of a "hot ticket" to concertgoers. Tickets for the opening show in Florida sold out over the phone in four minutes, demand exceeding supply by a factor of 10 to 1. To combat <a href="Ticket%20resale">ticket scalping</a>, the band avoided selling tickets in box offices as much as possible, preferring to sell over the telephone instead. Several cities' telephone systems were overwhelmed when Zoo TV tickets went on sale; Los Angeles telephone company <a href="Pacific%20Bell">Pacific Bell</a> reported 54 million calls in a four-hour period, while Boston's telephone system was temporarily shut down.

On 19 February, the band departed Dublin for the US to prepare for the tour. While rehearsing in Lakeland for opening night, Eno consulted U2 on the visual aspects of the show. Unlike many of the group's previous tours, which began ahead of or coincident with the release of a new album, Zoo TV started four months after "Achtung Baby" was released, giving fans more time to familiarise themselves with the new songs. By opening night, the album had already sold three million copies in the US and seven million worldwide.

The second leg of the tour, comprising 25 arena shows in Europe from May to June 1992, was announced on 30 April. Ticketing details were kept secret until radio advertisements announced that tickets had gone on sale at box offices. In many cases, tickets were limited to two-per-person to deter scalping. Due to the production costs and relatively small arena crowds, the European arena leg lost money. McGuinness had planned larger outdoor concerts in Berlin, Turin, Poland, and Vienna to help the tour break even, but only the Vienna concert occurred.

Two stadium legs were tentatively planned and dependent on the success of the arena tour: the North American "Outside Broadcast" leg from August–November 1992, and the European "Zooropa" leg from May–August 1993. While their playing stadiums was motivated by pragmatic concerns, U2 saw it as an artistic challenge as well, imagining what <a href="Salvador%20Dal%C3%AD">Salvador Dalí</a> or <a href="Andy%20Warhol">Andy Warhol</a> would do with such spaces. Rehearsals for "Outside Broadcast" began in <a href="Hersheypark%20Stadium">Hersheypark Stadium</a> in <a href="Hershey%2C%20Pennsylvania">Hershey, Pennsylvania</a>, in early August 1992; a public rehearsal show was held on 7 August. Technical problems and pacing issues forced refinement to the show. Six days before the official leg-opening <a href="Giants%20Stadium">Giants Stadium</a> show, the group delayed the concert by a day, due to the difficulty of assembling the large outdoor production and the destruction of the largest screen in a windstorm. By the time "Outside Broadcast" began, "Achtung Baby" had sold four million copies in the US. Tickets for the "Zooropa" leg went on sale in November 1992. The leg, which began in May 1993, was the band's first full stadium tour of Europe and marked the first time they had visited certain areas. Scheduling for the "Zoomerang" stadium leg in the Pacific from November–December 1993 afforded the band more off-days between shows than previous legs, but this amplified the exhaustion and restlessness that had set in by the tour's end.

Although the tour was listed as co-sponsored by <a href="MTV">MTV</a>, the group decided against explicit corporate sponsorship; band members, especially drummer <a href="Larry%20Mullen%2C%20Jr.">Larry Mullen, Jr.</a>, were uncertain that the tour would be profitable. The daily cost of producing the tour was US$125,000, regardless of whether a show was held on a given day. An attempt to convince Philips to donate the video equipment was unsuccessful, and the band had to pay for it themselves. In order to defray the heavy expenses of the Pacific shows, U2 asked for large guarantees from local <a href="Tour%20promoter">promoter</a>s up front, rather than sharing the financial burden as they had in the past. This sometimes caused promoters to raise ticket prices above usual levels, which in turn sometimes resulted in less than full houses. Profit margin was a slim four to five percent at most sold-out shows.

Between the support acts and U2's performance, a <a href="disc%20jockey">disc jockey</a> played records. For the 1992 legs, Irish rock journalist and radio presenter <a href="BP%20Fallon">BP Fallon</a> filled the role. Originally hired to write the Zoo TV tour programme, he played music from inside a Trabant on the B-stage, while providing commentary and wearing a cape and top hat. His official title was "Guru, Viber and DJ". He hosted "Zoo Radio", a November 1992 distributed radio special that showcased select live performances, audio oddities, and half-serious interviews with members of U2 and the opening acts. At the group's suggestion, Fallon eventually published a book about the tour entitled "U2 Faraway So Close". <a href="Paul%20Oakenfold">Paul Oakenfold</a>, who became one of the world's most prominent club DJs by the decade's end, replaced him later on the tour.
Beginning with the group's 24 May 1992 show, Fallon played "Television, the Drug of the Nation" by hip-hop artists <a href="the%20Disposable%20Heroes%20of%20Hiphoprisy">the Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy</a> as the last song before the lights were turned off and U2 took the stage. The band believed that the song, a commentary on mass media culture, encapsulated some of the tour's principal themes. The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy became one of the supporting acts for the "Outside Broadcast" leg, and after their supporting stint, "Television" was retained for the remainder of the tour as the pre-show closing song. After the venue darkened, one of several audio-video pieces was played to accompany the group taking the stage. During the "Outside Broadcast" leg, the piece was one by <a href="Emergency%20Broadcast%20Network">Emergency Broadcast Network</a> that reorganised video clips of <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">American President</a> <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a> to make him sing <a href="Queen%20%28band%29">Queen</a>'s "<a href="We%20Will%20Rock%20You">We Will Rock You</a>". A different piece, created by Ned O'Hanlon and Maurice Linnane of Dreamchaser video productions, was used on the 1993 legs; it wove looped video from <a href="Leni%20Riefenstahl">Leni Riefenstahl</a>'s films "<a href="Triumph%20of%20the%20Will">Triumph of the Will</a>" and "<a href="Olympia%20%281938%20film%29">Olympia</a>" with various video clips featuring war and news.

The concert began with a fixed sequence of six to eight consecutive "Achtung Baby" songs, a further sign that they were no longer the U2 of the 1980s. For the opening song, "<a href="Zoo%20Station%20%28song%29">Zoo Station</a>", Bono entered as his primary stage persona, "The Fly", appearing silhouetted against a giant screen of blue and white <a href="Noise%20%28video%29">video noise</a> interwoven with glimpses of xerox animations of the band members. "<a href="The%20Fly%20%28song%29">The Fly</a>" was usually performed next, with the video monitors flashing a rapidly changing array of textual words and aphorisms. Some of these included "Taste is the enemy of art", "Religion is a club", "Ignorance is bliss", "Watch more TV", "Believe" with letters fading out to leave "lie", and "Everything you know is wrong". (During the first week of the tour, media outlets incorrectly reported that the words shown included "Bomb Japan Now", forcing the band to issue a statement denying the claim.) Before "<a href="Even%20Better%20Than%20the%20Real%20Thing">Even Better Than the Real Thing</a>", Bono <a href="channel%20surf">channel surf</a>ed through live television programming, and during the song, as random images from television and pop culture flashed on screen, he filmed himself and the rest of the band with a <a href="camcorder">camcorder</a>.

In a "Zoo Radio" interview, the Edge described the visual material that accompanied the first three songs:

"<a href="Mysterious%20Ways%20%28song%29">Mysterious Ways</a>" featured a <a href="belly%20dance">belly dance</a>r on-stage. For the 1992 indoor legs, Florida resident Christina Petro was the dancer. Tour choreographer <a href="Morleigh%20Steinberg">Morleigh Steinberg</a> assumed the role starting with the "Outside Broadcast" leg. "<a href="One%20%28U2%20song%29">One</a>" was accompanied by the title word shown in many languages, as well as <a href="Mark%20Pellington">Mark Pellington</a>-directed video clips of <a href="American%20Bison">buffalo</a>s leading to a still image of <a href="David%20Wojnarowicz">David Wojnarowicz</a>'s "Falling Buffalo" photograph. For "<a href="Until%20the%20End%20of%20the%20World%20%28song%29">Until the End of the World</a>", Bono often played with a camera, kissing the lens and thrusting it into his crotch, a stark contrast from his more earnest stage behaviour of the past. Beginning with "Outside Broadcast", the band began playing "<a href="New%20Year%27s%20Day%20%28U2%20song%29">New Year's Day</a>" afterwards. During "<a href="Tryin%27%20to%20Throw%20Your%20Arms%20Around%20the%20World">Tryin' to Throw Your Arms Around the World</a>", Bono danced with a young female fan from the crowd (a ritual he had done more solemnly on past tours), shared camcorder video filming duties with her, and sprayed champagne. At this point in the show, Mullen sometimes sang a solo performance of "<a href="Dirty%20Old%20Town">Dirty Old Town</a>".
The group played many "Achtung Baby" songs very similarly to the way they had appeared on record. Since this material was complex and layered, most numbers featuring pre-recorded or offstage percussion, keyboard, or guitar elements underlying the U2 members' live instrumentals and vocals. The band had used backing tracks in live performance before, but with the need to sync live performance to Zoo TV's high-tech visuals, almost the entire show was synced and sequenced. This practice has continued on their subsequent tours.

Zoo TV was one of the first large-scale concerts to feature a B-stage, where performances were intended "to be the antidote to Zoo TV". The idea had been inspired by the successful informality of the <a href="Elvis%20%281968%20TV%20program%29">Elvis Presley "68 Comeback Special"</a>. Here, the band played quieter songs, such as acoustic arrangements of "<a href="Angel%20of%20Harlem">Angel of Harlem</a>", "<a href="When%20Love%20Comes%20to%20Town">When Love Comes to Town</a>", "<a href="Stay%20%28Faraway%2C%20So%20Close%21%29">Stay (Faraway, So Close!)</a>", and <a href="Lou%20Reed">Lou Reed</a>'s "<a href="Satellite%20of%20Love">Satellite of Love</a>". Many critics compared the B-stage performances to "<a href="busking">busking</a>" and singled them out as the shows' highlights.

After leaving the B-stage, U2 often played "<a href="Bad%20%28U2%20song%29">Bad</a>" or "<a href="Sunday%20Bloody%20Sunday">Sunday Bloody Sunday</a>", with performances of "<a href="Bullet%20the%20Blue%20Sky">Bullet the Blue Sky</a>" and "<a href="Running%20to%20Stand%20Still">Running to Stand Still</a>" following. For "Bullet the Blue Sky", the video screens displayed burning crosses and <a href="swastika">swastika</a>s. During "Running to Stand Still", Bono mimed the actions of a heroin addict from the B-stage, rolling up his sleeves and then pretending to spike his arm during the final lyric. Afterwards, red and yellow smoke flares ignited from either end of the B-stage, before the band re-grouped on the main stage for U2 classics played straight. "<a href="Where%20the%20Streets%20Have%20No%20Name">Where the Streets Have No Name</a>" was accompanied by sped-up video of the group in the desert from "The Joshua Tree"s photo shoot. U2 often finished their set with "<a href="Pride%20%28In%20the%20Name%20of%20Love%29">Pride (In the Name of Love)</a>" while a clip from <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a>'s famed "<a href="I%27ve%20Been%20to%20the%20Mountaintop">I've Been to the Mountaintop</a>" speech was played on the video screens. The group was initially unconvinced that the leap from the rest of the show's irony and artifice to something more sincere would be successful, but they thought that it was important to demonstrate that certain ideals were so strong and true that they could be held onto no matter the circumstance. The group alternated performances of "<a href="I%20Still%20Haven%27t%20Found%20What%20I%27m%20Looking%20For">I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For</a>" in acoustic form on the B-stage with using it to close the main set.

Commencing with the "Outside Broadcast" leg, clips from the tour's "video <a href="confessional">confessional</a> booth" were displayed on the set's screens between the main set and the encore. Concertgoers were encouraged to visit the booth prior to the concert and say whatever they wanted. These "confessions" varied from a woman flashing her breasts to a man revealing he had killed his friend in a car accident. Once the encore began, Bono would return as a different alter ego—Mirror Ball Man in 1992, and MacPhisto in 1993. Performances of "<a href="Desire%20%28U2%20song%29">Desire</a>" were accompanied by images of <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>, <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>, <a href="Paul%20Gascoigne">Paul Gascoigne</a>, and <a href="Jimmy%20Swaggart">Jimmy Swaggart</a>, and were meant as a criticism of greed; cash rained the stage and Bono portrayed Mirror Ball Man as an interpretation of the greedy preacher described in the song's lyrics. Bono often made a <a href="crank%20call">crank call</a> from the stage as his persona of the time. Such calls included dialing a <a href="phone%20sex">phone sex</a> line, calling a <a href="taxi%20cab">taxi cab</a>, ordering 10,000 pizzas (the Detroit pizza parlor delivered 100 pizzas during the show), or calling a local politician. Bono regularly called the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> in an attempt to contact President Bush. Though Bono never reached the President, Bush did acknowledge the calls during a press conference.

"<a href="Ultraviolet%20%28Light%20My%20Way%29">Ultraviolet (Light My Way)</a>" and "<a href="With%20or%20Without%20You">With or Without You</a>" were frequently played afterwards. Concerts initially ended with "Achtung Baby"s slower "<a href="Love%20Is%20Blindness">Love Is Blindness</a>". Beginning with the "Outside Broadcast" shows, it was often followed by Bono's <a href="falsetto">falsetto</a> take on <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a>'s long-time show-closing ballad, "<a href="Can%27t%20Help%20Falling%20in%20Love">Can't Help Falling in Love</a>", culminating in Bono softly stating that "Elvis is still in the building". Both songs presented a low-key, introspective conclusion to the show, in contrast to the dynamic, aggressive opening; the group also wanted to move away from its tradition of ending concerts with the fan sing-along favourite "<a href="40%20%28song%29">40</a>". The night finished with a single video message being displayed: "Thanks for shopping at Zoo TV".

On 11 June 1992, <a href="Benny%20Andersson">Benny Andersson</a> and <a href="Bj%C3%B6rn%20Ulvaeus">Björn Ulvaeus</a> of <a href="ABBA">ABBA</a> appeared on-stage in Stockholm for the first time in years to perform "<a href="Dancing%20Queen">Dancing Queen</a>" with the band, which U2 had frequently performed on the tour up to that point. Other guest performers on the tour included <a href="Axl%20Rose">Axl Rose</a>, Jo Shankar, and <a href="Daniel%20Lanois">Daniel Lanois</a>.

On 19 June 1992, during the European indoor leg, U2 played the "<a href="Stop%20Sellafield">Stop Sellafield</a>" concert in Manchester, alongside <a href="Kraftwerk">Kraftwerk</a>, <a href="Public%20Enemy%20%28group%29">Public Enemy</a>, and <a href="Big%20Audio%20Dynamite%20II">Big Audio Dynamite II</a>, to protest the operation of a second nuclear reactor at Sellafield. For the group's performance, the stage was made to resemble their Zoo TV stage. The following day, the band participated in a demonstration organised by <a href="Greenpeace">Greenpeace</a> in which protesters landed on the beach at Sellafield in rubber dinghies and displayed 700 placards for the waiting media.

At the first "Outside Broadcast" show on 12 August 1992 at Giants Stadium, Lou Reed performed "Satellite of Love" with the band; he and Bono dueted using their contrasting vocal styles. Bono re-confirmed the singer's influence on the band by announcing, "Every song we've ever written was a rip-off of a Lou Reed song." For the second show and the remainder of the tour, a taping of Reed singing the song was used for a virtual duet between him and Bono.

Novelist <a href="Salman%20Rushdie">Salman Rushdie</a> joined the band on stage in London's <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a> on 11 August 1993, despite the death <a href="fatw%C4%81">fatwā</a> against the author and the risk of violence arising from his controversial novel "<a href="The%20Satanic%20Verses">The Satanic Verses</a>". In reference to the novel's satanic references, Rushdie, when confronted by Bono's MacPhisto character, observed that "real devils don't wear horns". In 2010, Clayton recalled that "Bono had been calling Salman Rushdie from the stage every night on the Zoo TV tour. When we played Wembley, Salman showed up in person and the stadium erupted. You [could] tell from Larry's face that we weren't expecting it. Salman was a regular visitor after that. He had a backstage pass and he used it as often as possible. For a man who was supposed to be in hiding, it was remarkably easy to see him around the place."

Bono assumed a number of costumed alter egos during Zoo TV performances. The three main personae that he used on stage were "<a href="The%20Fly%20%28song%29">The Fly</a>", "Mirror Ball Man", and "MacPhisto". Additionally, during performances of "Bullet the Blue Sky" and "Running to Stand Still", he appeared on-stage wearing a military utility vest and cap, and a microphone headset. As this character, he ranted and raved in an act he said was set in the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>.

To escape their reputation for being overly serious and self-righteous, U2 decided to alter their image by being more facetious. Bono said, "All through the Eighties we tried to be ourselves and failed when the lights were on. Which is what set us up for Zoo TV. We decided to have some fun being other people, or at least other versions of ourselves." The Edge said, "We were quite thrilled at the prospect of smashing U2 and starting all over again." The group viewed humour as the appropriate response to their negative perception and that although their message would not change, they needed to change how they delivered it to their audience.

Bono conceived his "Fly" persona during the writing of the song of the same name. The character began with Bono wearing an oversized pair of <a href="blaxploitation">blaxploitation</a> sunglasses, given to him by wardrobe manager Fintan Fitzgerald, to lighten the mood in the studio. Bono wrote the song's lyrics as this character, composing a sequence of "single-line aphorisms". He developed the persona into a leather-clad egomaniac, describing his outfit as having Lou Reed's glasses, <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a>'s jacket, and <a href="Jim%20Morrison">Jim Morrison</a>'s leather pants. To match the character's dark fashion, Bono, whose hair is naturally brown, dyed it black.

Bono began each concert as The Fly and continued to play the character for most of the first half of the concert. In contrast to his earnest self of the 1980s, as The Fly, Bono strutted around the stage with "swagger and style", exhibiting mannerisms of an egotistical rock star. He adopted the mindset that he was "licensed to be an egomaniac". He often stayed in character away from the tour stage, including for public appearances and when staying in hotels. He said, "That rather cracked character could say things that I couldn't", and that it offered him a greater freedom of speech.

As the Mirror Ball Man, Bono dressed in a shining silver <a href="Lam%C3%A9%20%28fabric%29">lamé</a> suit with matching shoes and cowboy hat. The character was meant to parody greedy American <a href="televangelist">televangelist</a>s, showmen, and car salesman, and was inspired by <a href="Phil%20Ochs">Phil Ochs</a>' Elvis persona from his 1970 tour. Bono said that the character represented "a kind of showman America. He had the confidence and charm to pick up a mirror and look at himself and give the glass a big kiss. He loved cash and in his mind success was God's blessing. If he's made money, he can't have made any mistakes." As the character, Bono spoke with an exaggerated <a href="Southern%20American%20English">Southern US accent</a>. Mirror Ball Man appeared during the show's encore and made nightly prank calls, often to the White House. Bono portrayed this alter ego on the first three legs of the tour, but replaced him with MacPhisto for the 1993 legs.

MacPhisto was created to parody the devil and was named after <a href="Mephistopheles">Mephistopheles</a> of the <a href="Faust%20%28opera%29">Faust</a> legend. Initially called "Mr. Gold", MacPhisto wore a gold lamé suit with gold platform shoes, pale makeup, lipstick, and devil's horns atop his head. As MacPhisto, Bono spoke with an exaggerated upper-class English accent, similar to that of a down-on-his-luck character actor. The character was created as a European replacement for the American-influenced Mirror Ball Man. The initial inspiration for MacPhisto came from the stage musical "<a href="The%20Black%20Rider">The Black Rider</a>". Realisation of the character did not come about until rehearsal the night before the first of the 1993 shows. According to Bono, "We came up with a sort of old English Devil, a pop star long past his prime returning regularly from sessions on The Strip in Vegas and regaling anyone who would listen to him at cocktail hour with stories from the good old, bad old days." MacPhisto sang the closing "Can't Help Falling in Love" with an oddly childlike manner that many reviewers found one of the most poignant moments of the show.

Bono continued making prank calls as MacPhisto, but the targets changed with the location of each concert. Many of them were local politicians that Bono wished to mock by engaging them in character as the devil. He enjoyed making these calls, saying, "When you're dressed as the Devil, your conversation is immediately loaded, so if you tell somebody you really like what they're doing, you know it's not a compliment." The band intended for MacPhisto to add humour while making a point. Said the Edge, "That character was a great device for saying the opposite of what you meant. It made the point so easily and with real humor." A female Cardiff fan who was pulled on-stage questioned Bono's motives for dressing as the devil, prompting the singer to compare his act to the plot of the <a href="C.%20S.%20Lewis">C. S. Lewis</a> novel "<a href="The%20Screwtape%20Letters">The Screwtape Letters</a>".

As the "Zooropa" leg unfolded in 1993, U2 became concerned about the volatile political situation in <a href="Post-communism">post-communist</a> Europe and the resurgence of <a href="radical%20nationalism">radical nationalism</a>. The opening of the show was modified to reflect this, with sounds from "Lenin's Favourite Songs" mixed with <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven's</a> <a href="Symphony%20No.%209%20%28Beethoven%29">Ninth Symphony</a> and monotone voices asking "What do you want?" in different European languages. A visual of the <a href="Flag%20of%20Europe">Flag of Europe</a> was presented which then crumbled after one of the stars fell off.

A number of these European shows featured live satellite link-ups with people living in war-torn <a href="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a> during the <a href="siege%20of%20Sarajevo">siege of Sarajevo</a>/<a href="Bosnian%20War">Bosnian War</a>. The transmissions were arranged with help from American aid worker <a href="Bill%20Carter">Bill Carter</a>. Before their 3 July show in <a href="Verona">Verona</a>, Italy, the band met with Carter to give an interview about Bosnia for <a href="Radiotelevision%20of%20Bosnia-Herzegovina">Radio Televizija Bosne I Hercegovina</a>. Carter described his experiences helping Sarajevans while surviving the dangerous living conditions. While in Sarajevo, Carter had seen a television interview on MTV in which Bono mentioned the theme of the "Zooropa" leg was a unified Europe. Feeling that such an aim was empty if Bosnia went overlooked, Carter sought Bono's help. He requested that U2 visit Sarajevo to bring attention to the war and break the "media fatigue" that had occurred from covering the conflict. Bono wanted the band to play a concert in the city, but their tour schedule prevented this, and McGuinness believed that a concert there would make them and their audience targets for the Serbian aggressors.

Instead, the group agreed to use the tour's satellite dish to conduct live video transmissions between their concerts and Carter in Sarajevo. Carter returned to the city and was able to assemble a video unit. The band had to purchase a satellite dish to be sent to Sarajevo and had to pay a £100,000 fee to join the <a href="European%20Broadcasting%20Union">European Broadcasting Union</a>. Once set up, the band began satellite link-ups to Sarajevo on a near nightly basis, the first airing on 17 July 1993 in <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a>, Italy. To connect with the EBU satellite feeds, Carter and two co-workers had to traverse "<a href="Sniper%20Alley">Sniper Alley</a>" at night to reach the Sarajevo television station, and they had to film with as little light as possible to avoid the attention of snipers. This was done a total of ten times over the course of a month. Carter discussed the deteriorating situation in the city, and Bosnians often spoke to U2 and their audience. These grim interviews deviated from the rest of the show, and they were completely unscripted, leaving the group unsure of who would be speaking or what they would say. U2 stopped the broadcasts in August 1993 after learning that the siege of Sarajevo was being reported on the front of many British newspapers. Though this trend had begun before the first link-up, Nathan Jackson suggested that U2's actions had brought awareness of the situation to their fans, and to the British public indirectly.

Reactions to the transmissions were mixed, triggering a media debate concerning the ethical implications of mixing rock entertainment with human tragedy. The Edge said, "A lot of nights it felt like quite an abrupt interruption that was probably not particularly welcomed by a lot of people in the audience. You were grabbed out of a rock concert and given a really strong dose of reality and it was quite hard sometimes to get back to something as frivolous as a show having watched five or ten minutes of real human suffering." Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. In 2002, he said, "I can't remember anything more excruciating than those Sarajevo link-ups. It was like throwing a bucket of cold water over everybody. You could see your audience going, 'What the fuck are these guys doing?' But I'm proud to have been a part of a group who were trying to do something." During a transmission for the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo told Bono via satellite, "We know you're not going to do anything for us. You're going to go back to a rock show. You're going to forget that we even exist. And we're all going to die." Some people close to the band joined the <a href="War%20Child%20%28charity%29">War Child</a> charity project, including Brian Eno. Writer <a href="Bill%20Flanagan">Bill Flanagan</a> believes that the link-ups accomplished Bono's goal for Zoo TV of "illustrating onstage the obscenity of idly flipping from a war on CNN to rock videos on MTV". U2 vowed to perform in Sarajevo someday, <a href="U2%20concert%20in%20Sarajevo">eventually fulfilling this commitment</a> on their 1997 <a href="PopMart%20Tour">PopMart Tour</a>.

U2 recorded their next album, "Zooropa", from February to May 1993 during an extended break between the third and fourth legs of the tour. The album was intended as a companion <a href="Extended%20play">EP</a> to "Achtung Baby", but soon expanded into a full LP. Recording could not be completed before the tour restarted, and for the first month of the "Zooropa" leg, the band flew home after shows, recording until the early morning and working on their off-days, before travelling to their next destination. Clayton called the process "about the craziest thing you could do to yourself", while Mullen said of it, "It was mad, but it was mad good, as opposed to mad bad." McGuinness later said the band had nearly wrecked themselves in the process. The album was released on 5 July 1993. Influenced by the tour's themes of technology and mass media, "Zooropa" was an even greater departure in style from their earlier recordings than "Achtung Baby" was, incorporating further dance music influences and electronic effects into their sound. A number of songs from the album were incorporated into the subsequent "Zooropa" and "Zoomerang" legs, most frequently "<a href="Numb%20%28U2%20song%29">Numb</a>" and "<a href="Stay%20%28Faraway%2C%20So%20Close%21%29">Stay (Faraway, So Close!)</a>". For the "Zoomerang" leg, "<a href="Daddy%27s%20Gonna%20Pay%20For%20Your%20Crashed%20Car">Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car</a>" and "<a href="Lemon%20%28U2%20song%29">Lemon</a>" were added to the encore and "Dirty Day" to the main set.

On 9 September 1992, a portion of U2's performance at the <a href="Pontiac%20Silverdome">Pontiac Silverdome</a> was broadcast live to the <a href="1992%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">1992 MTV Video Music Awards</a>. The band performed "Even Better Than the Real Thing" while VMA host <a href="Dana%20Carvey">Dana Carvey</a>, dressed as his "<a href="Wayne%27s%20World">Wayne's World</a>" Garth persona, accompanied the band on drums in Los Angeles. A "Zoo Radio" special included live selections from 1992 shows from Toronto, Dallas, Tempe, and New York City. On 28 and 29 November 1992, a TV special entitled "Zoo TV Featuring U2" was aired, featuring portions of several "Outside Broadcast" leg shows as well as <a href="William%20S.%20Burroughs">William S. Burroughs</a>' reading of the sardonic poem "<a href="Thanksgiving%20Prayer">Thanksgiving Prayer</a>". Directed by <a href="Kevin%20Godley">Kevin Godley</a>, the programme was broadcast in North America on <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a>, and in Europe via <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a>, <a href="Sky%20Deutschland">Premiere</a>, <a href="France%202">France 2</a>, <a href="Rai%20Uno">Rai Uno</a>, <a href="RTVE">RTVE</a>, <a href="TV1000">TV1000</a>, and <a href="Veronica%20%28TV%20channel%29">Veronica</a>. Several 1992 shows, including the 11 June concert in Stockholm and 27 October concert in El Paso, were broadcast into the homes of fans who had won contests. In October 1992, U2 released "Achtung Baby: The Videos, The Cameos, and a Whole Lot of Interference from Zoo TV", a <a href="VHS">VHS</a> compilation of nine <a href="music%20video">music video</a>s from "Achtung Baby". Interspersed between the music videos were clips of so-called "interference", comprising documentary footage, media clips, and other video similar to what was displayed on tour.

Two November 1993 "Zoomerang" shows in Sydney were filmed as part of a worldwide television broadcast. The 26 November show was to be a rehearsal for the production crew for the official filming the following night. However, Clayton, who began drinking excessively on the latter stages of the tour, suffered an <a href="Blackout%20%28alcohol-related%20amnesia%29">alcoholic blackout</a> from the previous night and was unable to perform. Bass <a href="guitar%20technician">guitar technician</a> Stuart Morgan filled in for him, marking the first time any member of U2 had missed a show. Clayton recovered in time to play the 27 November show, which was broadcast and was the only show used in the resulting video release. The concert was broadcast in the United States on tape-delayed <a href="pay-per-view">pay-per-view</a>. U2 originally planned to produce the concert with MTV for a January 1994 "triplecast" that would have offered three different perspectives of the show on three separate channels. However, the group cancelled the "triplecast" after realising they had not fully developed the concept. The show was subsequently released as the concert video "" in 1994, and the double CD "<a href="Zoo%20TV%20Live">Zoo TV Live</a>" in 2006 to subscribing members of U2's website. The video won the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Long%20Form%20Music%20Video">Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video</a> at the <a href="37th%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">37th Annual Grammy Awards</a> ceremony.

Reviews written during the initial arena legs reflected the dramatic change in U2's approach. Many critics published favourable reviews about the tour. The "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" praised the special effects for supplementing the music. The reviewer wrote, "The often-surrealistic effects always served the songs, not the other way around." The review concluded, "this magnificent multimedia production will serve as a pinnacle in rock's onstage history for sometime to come". <a href="Edna%20Gundersen">Edna Gundersen</a> of "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" said that U2 was dismantling its myth and wrote that the show was "a trippy and decadent concert of bedazzling visuals and adventurous music". "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>"s Jon Wiederhorn wrote that he expected to dislike the show based upon their past stage history, "But, alas, I cannot be negative about U2 tonight. Their Zoo TV show is visually stunning, musically unparalleled, downright moving and, dammit, truly entertaining." "<a href="Hot%20Press">Hot Press</a>" Bill Graham said of the show, "U2 don't so much use every trick in the book as invent a whole new style of rock performance art." For Graham, the tour resolved any doubts he had about the band—particularly about Bono—following their reinvention with "Achtung Baby".

Other critics indicated befuddlement as to U2's purpose. The "<a href="Asbury%20Park%20Press">Asbury Park Press</a>" wrote that the long string of "Achtung Baby" song presentations that opened the show made one forget about the band's past, and that "almost everything you knew about U2 a couple years ago is, in fact, wrong now". "<a href="The%20Star-Ledger">The Star-Ledger</a>" said that the band shortchanged its music with its video presentations and that especially during the opening sequence, "one was only aware of the music as a soundtrack to the real 'show'". It concluded by saying that the group had lost the sense of mystery and yearning that made it great and that they had succumbed to the style of music videos. <a href="Jon%20Pareles">Jon Pareles</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" acknowledged that U2 was trying to break its former earnest image and that they were a "vastly improved band" for being "trendy" and "funny"; yet, he commented, "U2 wants to have its artifice and its sincerity at the same time—no easy thing—and it hasn't yet made the breakthrough that will unite them."

The stadium legs of the tour received more consistent praise than the arena shows. Critics noted that while the show and its <a href="setlist">setlist</a> were largely the same as before, the tour mostly benefited from the increased scale. The "<a href="New%20York%20Daily%20News">New York Daily News</a>" said that the stage "looked like a city made of television sets—an electronic Oz" and that "glitz was used not as a mere distraction (as it has been by so many video-age artists), but as a determined conceit". Gundersen also made the comparison to <a href="Land%20of%20Oz">Oz</a>, saying that even though the band was dwarfed by the setting, their adventurous musicianship still shone through. She concluded that the group had "deliver[ed] a brilliant high-wire act" between mocking and exploiting rock music clichés, a comparison also made by stage designer Willie Williams. <a href="Robert%20Hilburn">Robert Hilburn</a> of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" said of the outdoor American leg, "Zoo TV is the yardstick by which all other stadium shows will be measured." <a href="David%20Fricke">David Fricke</a> of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" said that the band had "regained critical and commercial favor by negotiating an inspired balance between rock's cheap thrills and its own sense of moral burden". He praised the band for "retool[ing] themselves as wiseacres with heart and elephant bucks to burn". Fricke noted that the increased visual effects for the "Outside Broadcast" leg increased the shows' "mind-fuck" factor. Many critics described the tour as "<a href="post-modern">post-modern</a>". The writers of "Rolling Stone", in a best-of-1992 issue, named U2 co-winners of "Best Band", while awarding the Zoo TV Tour honours for both "Best Tour" and "Worst Tour".

"<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" praised the "Zooropa" leg, with the reviewer stating, "I came as a sceptic, and left believing I had witnessed the most sophisticated meeting of technical wizardry and mojo priestcraft ever mounted." <a href="Dave%20Fanning">Dave Fanning</a> of "<a href="The%20Irish%20Times">The Irish Times</a>" praised the "Zooropa" leg, stating, "If this is the show by which all other rock circuses must be measured, then God help the new music." Fanning observed that the group, particularly Bono, exhibited "style, sex and self-assurance". "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" wrote, "No one is dancing on the edges of rock'n'roll's contradictions as effectively these days as U2." The stadium legs had their detractors, as "<a href="NME">NME</a>" called the shows a "two-hour post-modernist <a href="Pot%20Noodle">pot noodle</a> advert made by politically naive, culturally unaware squares with the help of some cool, arty people". Graham thought that the scale of the stadium shows led to more predictability and less interaction with the audiences.

The group and the music industry were unsure how fans would receive the tour beforehand. During the first week of shows, Bono said, "This show is a real roller coaster ride, and some people will want to get off, I'm sure." He remained optimistic that their devoted fans would continue following them, but cautioned he had no intention of resisting the glamour and fame: "Oh, but it's "fun" to be carried away by the hype. Where would you be without the hype?... You can't pretend all the promotion and all the fanfare is not happening." Some hardcore fans, particularly in the US, objected to the tour as a blatant sellout to commercial values, while others misinterpreted the tour's mocking of excess, believing that, according to "<a href="VH1%27s%20Legends">VH1's Legends</a>", "U2 had 'lost it' and that Bono had become an egomaniac". Many Christian fans were offended by the band's antics and believed they had abandoned their religious faith.

By the outdoor legs, many fans knew what to expect, and Pareles observed that Bono's admonitions to never cheer a rock star were greeted with idolatrous applause; he concluded that the show's message of scepticism was somewhat lost on the audience and that, "No matter what Bono tells his fans, they seem likely to trust him anyway." By the end of the tour's first year, U2 had won over many fans. In a 1992 end-of-year poll, readers of "<a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">Q</a>" voted U2 "The Best Act in the World Today". The band's almost clean sweep of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>"s end-of-year readers' poll—which included "Best Artist", "Best Tour", and Bono as "Sexiest Male Artist"—reconfirmed for the magazine they were the "world's biggest rock band".

On the opening leg, U2 sold 528,763 tickets and grossed US$13,215,414 in 32 shows. They grossed US$67 million overall in 73 North American shows in 1992, easily the highest amount for any touring artist that year. At the time, this was the third-highest gross for a North American tour, behind the Rolling Stones' 1989 <a href="Steel%20Wheels/Urban%20Jungle%20Tour">Steel Wheels Tour</a> and <a href="New%20Kids%20on%20the%20Block">New Kids on the Block</a>'s 1990 <a href="The%20Magic%20Summer%20Tour">Magic Summer Tour</a>. Zoo TV's ticket sales in 1992 for America and Europe totalled 2.9 million. The "Zooropa" stadium leg the following year played to more than 2.1 million people over 43 dates between 9 May and 28 August. In total, the Zoo TV Tour played to about 5.3 million people. The band incurred heavy expenses to produce the tour, leading to only a small profit. According to McGuinness, "We grossed $30 million in T-shirt sales. Without those we'd be fucked." Bono later said, "When we built Zoo TV, we were so close to bankruptcy that if five percent fewer people went, U2 was bankrupt. Even in our irresponsible, youthful and fatal disregard of such material matters, it was terrifying."

For the Zoo TV Tour, U2 embraced the "rock star" identity they had struggled with and were reluctant to accept throughout the 1980s. They drew the attention of celebrities, including American presidential candidate <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>, and they began partying more than they had in the past. During parts of the tour, the band attracted the fashion crowd; Clayton's romantic relationship with supermodel <a href="Naomi%20Campbell">Naomi Campbell</a> and Bono's friendship with supermodel <a href="Christy%20Turlington">Christy Turlington</a> made them the subjects of unwanted tabloid attention. By the "Zoomerang" leg, Clayton's relationship with Campbell was fracturing and he was drinking frequently. After missing the group's 26 November 1993 show in Sydney from an alcoholic blackout, Clayton quit drinking altogether. The incident resulted in tensions within the group in the tour's final weeks. The Edge began dating the belly dancer Morleigh Steinberg during the tour, and the two later married in 2002.

The tour's two-year length, then U2's longest, exhausted the band as the final legs unfolded. Following the conclusion of Zoo TV, U2 took an extended break from recording as a group. Mullen and Clayton moved into <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> apartments in New York City, where they sought out music lessons to become better musicians. The Edge and Bono spent most of 1994 living in newly renovated houses in the <a href="South%20of%20France">South of France</a>. The Edge said, "as a band I think [the tour] stretched us all. We were a different band after that and touring was different." 

Although The Fly character was retired after the tour, Bono began to wear tinted glasses, similar to his Fly sunglasses, in most public appearances. The glasses have since become a stylistic trademark of the singer in both his musical and activist roles. The Fly and MacPhisto characters appeared in the animated music video to U2's 1995 song "<a href="Hold%20Me%2C%20Thrill%20Me%2C%20Kiss%20Me%2C%20Kill%20Me">Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me</a>" from the <a href="Batman%20Forever%20%28soundtrack%29">soundtrack to "Batman Forever"</a>. Author Višnja Cogan wrote that "the video crystallises and concludes the Zoo TV period and the changes that occurred". Director <a href="Joel%20Schumacher">Joel Schumacher</a> attempted to create a role for Bono as MacPhisto in "<a href="Batman%20Forever">Batman Forever</a>", but both later agreed it was not suitable. Producer <a href="Nellee%20Hooper">Nellee Hooper</a> later told Bono that Zoo TV "ruined irony for everyone".

The <a href="Pixies">Pixies</a>' stint as a support act produced a controversy that partially contributed to their break-up. In July 1992, "Spin" featured a controversial cover story titled "U2 On Tour: The Story They Didn't Want You to Read", which detailed author <a href="James%20Greer%20%28writer%29">Jim Greer</a>'s travels on the tour's first weeks with his unidentified girlfriend (who turned out to be Pixies' bassist <a href="Kim%20Deal">Kim Deal</a>). The article featured their criticisms of U2 for the supposed poor treatment the Pixies received. Both groups disagreed and were livid at Deal, particularly Pixies frontman <a href="Black%20Francis">Black Francis</a>. In 1993, following tensions within the group, Francis announced the Pixies had dissolved.

As the tour drew to a close, U2 entered prolonged discussions about creating a Zoo TV television channel in partnership with MTV. This never materialised, but in 1997, MTV ran a brief miniseries called "Zoo-TV", which featured <a href="Emergency%20Broadcast%20Network">Emergency Broadcast Network</a> extending their tour role in creating contemporary surrealist satirical video. U2 endorsed the effort as a representation of what the tour would have been like as a news magazine, but their direct role was limited to providing half-financing and outtakes from the "Zooropa" album. "<a href="Wired%20%28magazine%29">Wired</a>" magazine said the series "pushe[d] the edge of commercial—even comprehensible—television".

U2's subsequent concert tour, 1997's <a href="PopMart%20Tour">PopMart Tour</a>, followed in Zoo TV's footsteps by mocking another social trend, this time consumerism. Paul McGuinness said the group wanted "the production [of PopMart] to beat Zoo TV", and accordingly, the tour's spectacle was a further shift away from their austere stage shows of the 1980s; PopMart's stage featured a LED screen, a golden arch containing the sound system, and a mirrorball lemon that served as a transport to the B-stage. Although critics were much less receptive to PopMart, in a 2009 interview, Bono said that he considers that tour to be their best: "Pop(Mart) is our finest hour. It's better than Zoo TV aesthetically, and as an art project it is a clearer thought."

In 2005, during their <a href="Vertigo%20Tour">Vertigo Tour</a>, the group often played a short set of songs as a homage to the Zoo TV Tour—"Zoo Station", "The Fly", and "Mysterious Ways"—as part of the first encore; performances of "Zoo Station" included the interference in the background visual effects, and "The Fly" used flashing text effects on the LED screens similar to the Zoo TV visuals.

Critics regard the Zoo TV Tour as one of rock's most memorable tours. During the "Zooropa" leg of the tour, <a href="Guy%20Garcia">Guy Garcia</a> of "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" called Zoo TV "one of the most electrifying rock shows ever staged". In 1997, Robert Hilburn wrote that "It's not unreasonable to think of it as the "<a href="Sgt.%20Pepper%27s%20Lonely%20Hearts%20Club%20Band">Sgt. Pepper's</a>" of rock tours." In 2002, Tom Doyle of "Q" called it "still the most spectacular rock tour staged by any band", and in 2013, the magazine listed it as one of the "ten greatest gigs of all time". In 2009, critic <a href="Greg%20Kot">Greg Kot</a> said, "Zoo TV remains the finest supersized tour mounted by any band in the last two decades." Ryan Dombal of <a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a> wrote in a review of "Achtung Baby"s 20th anniversary <a href="reissue">reissue</a>, "Even 20 years on, the tour looks like something to behold, a singularly inventive experience that no band—including U2 itself—has been able to really expound upon in a meaningful way." "Rolling Stone" included the tour on its 2017 list of "The 50 Greatest Concerts of the Last 50 Years".

Ronald Niel Stuart, <a href="Victoria%20Cross">VC</a>, <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">DSO</a>, <a href="Decoration%20for%20Officers%20of%20the%20Royal%20Naval%20Reserve">RD</a>, <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Reserve">RNR</a> (26 August 1886 – 8 February 1954) was a <a href="British%20Merchant%20Navy">British Merchant Navy</a> <a href="Commodore%20%28RN%29">commodore</a> and <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> <a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">captain</a> who was highly commended following extensive and distinguished service at sea over a period of more than thirty-five years. During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> he was awarded the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>, the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a>, the French <a href="Croix%20de%20guerre%201914%E2%80%931918%20%28France%29">Croix de Guerre avec Palmes</a> and the United States' <a href="Navy%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Navy Cross</a> for a series of daring operations he conducted while serving in the Royal Navy during the <a href="Naval%20warfare%20of%20World%20War%20I%23Atlantic">War at Sea</a>.

Stuart received his Victoria Cross following a ballot by the men under his command. This unusual method of selection was used after the Admiralty board was unable to choose which members of the crew deserved the honour after a desperate engagement between a <a href="Q-ship">Q-ship</a> and a German submarine off the Irish coast. His later career included command of the liner <a href="RMS%20Empress%20of%20Britain%20%281930%29">RMS "Empress of Britain"</a> and the management of the London office of a major transatlantic shipping company. Following his retirement in 1951, Stuart moved into his sister's cottage in Kent and died three years later. A sometimes irascible man, he was reportedly embarrassed by any fuss surrounding his celebrity and was known to exclaim "Mush!" at any demonstration of strong emotion.

Ronald Niel Stuart was born in 1886 in <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> to Neil Stuart and Mary Harrison, both from experienced seafaring families. Neil Sr. had been born on <a href="Prince%20Edward%20Island">Prince Edward Island</a> in <a href="Canada">Canada</a> and had met and married Mary in <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>. She was the daughter of a master mariner from <a href="Australia">Australia</a>. In the 1880s the family moved to Liverpool, where Stuart was born as the youngest of six children. Neil worked in the city as a dock superintendent and owner of a wholesale tea shop before dying suddenly while preparing for a return to the Merchant Navy.

Stuart was by this time a stocky, blonde, blue-eyed man described as "powerful" but "very bleak and penetrating". He was initially educated at <a href="Shaw%20Street%20College">Shaw Street College</a>, but following his father's death was forced to leave and take a job as a clerk in an office. Stuart's son commented that "He hated it [the job]. He hated Liverpool". In 1902, Stuart decided to leave the city and find work in a different environment. He took an apprenticeship with the shipping company Steele & Co and was sent to learn his trade on the sailing <a href="barque">barque</a> "Kirkhill".

In 1905 the "Kirkhill" was wrecked on a rock near the <a href="Falkland%20Islands">Falkland Islands</a>. Stuart survived the sinking and returned to England to continue his training. He was posted to a new ship upon his return but she too was wrecked by a cyclone off the <a href="Florida">Florida</a> coast. Eventually, after several years service he achieved his mariner's qualifications and gained a job with the <a href="Allan%20Line">Allan Line</a> as a junior officer. He then served in a variety of sailing and steam ships traveling across most of the world. In 1910, the Allan Line was taken over by the <a href="CP%20Ships">Canadian Pacific Line</a> and he continued working with the company's new owners as a junior ship's officer.

At the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> Stuart was called up to service, as an officer in the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Reserve">Royal Naval Reserve</a>. He was originally posted as a junior officer on board the old and obsolete <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> <a href="HMS%20Opossum%20%281895%29">HMS "Opossum"</a> in <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a>. This ship was used for harbour patrols and intercepting neutral merchant ships and other work Stuart considered tedious. He became increasingly impatient with the life and repeatedly applied to his senior officers with requests for transfer; at one point he even requested that he be commissioned into the army. All of these were turned down, with increasing levels of hostility from his commanders, one of whom was reported to have told him to "Go to hell! And shut the door behind you!"

In the spring of 1916 he was transferred as first <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> to a <a href="Q-ship">Q-ship</a> under <a href="Gordon%20Campbell%2C%20VC">Gordon Campbell</a>. A Q-ship was a merchant ship with hidden weaponry, commanded secretly by the navy and manned by a Royal Navy crew. When attacked by a submarine, the Q-ship would feign damage until the enemy was close enough to engage and then reveal its weapons to counter-attack. Campbell, a major proponent of Q-ship strategy, was impressed with Stuart's stubborn refusal to accept the two years of rejection and brought him in to replace an officer whose nerves had cracked under the strain of Q-ship operations.

Stuart's experience in merchant shipping proved invaluable to his work and he soon had the crew of Q5 (also known as <a href="HMS%20Farnborough">HMS "Farnborough"</a>) disciplined and the ship well maintained and run. Campbell himself was very pleased with his executive officer, declaring him "on the top line". Stuart and Campbell would later fall out over Stuart's belief that Campbell was exaggerating the danger of Q-ship service, Stuart comparing his own life favourably with service in <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">the trenches</a>.

His first year of Q-ship service was frustrating for Stuart and the crew. Although, prior to his attachment to the ship, "Farnborough" had succeeded in sinking an enemy submarine (the <a href="SM%20U-68">"U-68"</a> in March 1916), there had been no successes since. In February 1917, Campbell decided that in order to properly invite an attack, the "Farnborough" would have to actually be torpedoed before combat and then engage the submarine as she closed to finish the job with shellfire. On 17 February this theory was proven correct off Southern <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> when the lone "Farnborough" was struck by a torpedo fired at extreme range. Campbell intentionally failed to evade the missile and the ship took the blow in the hold, causing some minor injuries to the crew but serious damage to the ship. The crew were well rehearsed and the "panic party" took to their boats with a great show of alarm and disorder while the gun crews manned positions on their hidden weapons. When four lifeboats had been released and the ship had settled in the water and was clearly sinking, the submarine <a href="SM%20U-83">"U-83"</a> pulled up just ten yards (9m) from the wreck. A hail of shot was then unleashed by the "Farnborough's" remaining crew from their six-pounder gun and several <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>s into the stationary submarine. The very first shot decapitated the German captain Bruno Hoppe and the U-boat was rapidly reduced to a battered wreck. Eight German sailors escaped the submarine before it sank but only two could be pulled from the water, one of whom subsequently died from his wounds.

The "Farnborough" too was sinking from her torpedo damage. Realising this, Campbell left the men in the boats, destroyed all confidential papers and radioed for help. His unorthodox message read: "Q5 slowly sinking respectfully wishes you goodbye". This message reached nearby naval shipping, and within an hour the destroyers HMS "Narwhal" and HMS "Buttercup" arrived and began to tow the stricken ship back to land. During the night a <a href="depth%20charge">depth charge</a> accidentally exploded on board "Farnborough" and the tow was dropped. Campbell ordered the twelve men remaining aboard into a lifeboat and attempted to take a final survey of his vessel, only to be driven back by another exploding depth charge. On returning to the rail he discovered that Stuart had disobeyed his order and remained on board, to make sure his captain disembarked safely. The tow was later reattached and the battered "Farnborough" beached at Mill Cove, in no fit state to return to sea. Campbell was awarded the Victoria Cross in recognition of his service in the action and £1,000 of <a href="prize%20money">prize money</a> was shared among the crew. Stuart and Engineer-Lieutenant Len Loveless were both presented with the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a>.

Following the action Stuart remained with Campbell and Loveless as Inspectors of Shipping, choosing those vessels they believed to be best suited to Q-ship work for naval service. After some time ashore all three returned to sea in a vessel they had personally chosen, an old, battered tramp steamer named SS "Vittoria". Renaming it , they armed their vessel with a gun, two twelve pounders, two machine guns, <a href="torpedo%20tubes">torpedo tubes</a> and depth charges. Thus armed the "Pargust" departed on her first patrol to the same grounds where "U-83" had been sunk, in the waters south of Ireland. For the first few days her duties consisted only of rescuing survivors from sunken cargo ships but with increasing German activity, an attack was expected at any moment. On 7 June 1917, "Pargust" was suddenly struck by a torpedo fired at very close range from an unseen German submarine. Unlike the "Farnborough" action, the damage done to the "Pargust" was immense. The ship was holed close to the waterline, and its cover was almost blown when one of the twelve pounder gun ports was blasted free from its mounting; it was only the quick thinking of sailor <a href="William%20Williams%20%28VC%29">William Williams</a>, who took the full weight of the gun port on himself, that prevented the gun being exposed. One petty officer was killed and a number wounded.

By this stage in the war, the German submarine authorities had become aware of the existence of Q-ships and Captain Ernst Rosenow of was taking no risks with his target, remaining at distance watching the staged panicked evacuation of the ship. While the hidden gun crews watched the enemy approach the lifeboats, the officer in charge of the boats, Lieutenant Francis Hereford, realised that the submarine would follow his movements, as its commander assumed him to be the captain. Hereford therefore ordered his men to row back towards the ship, thus luring the enemy into range. This made the submarine commander believe that the ship's crew were planning to regain their vessel and he immediately closed to just , surfaced and began angrily <a href="Flag%20semaphore">semaphoring</a> to the "survivors" in the boats. This was exactly what the gun crews had been waiting for and a volley of fire was directed at the U-boat. Numerous holes were blown in the <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> and the submarine desperately attempted to flee on the surface before slowing down and heeling over, trailing oil. The gun crews then stopped firing only for the submarine to suddenly restart its engines and attempt to escape. In a final barrage of fire the submarine was hit fatally, a large explosion blowing the vessel in two. Rosenow and 22 of his crew were killed, while two survivors were rescued by the panic party.

The wrecked "Pargust" was taken in tow by HMS "Crocus", and HMS "Zinnia" and reached <a href="Cobh">Queenstown</a> barely afloat nearly two days later. The port's admiral congratulated the crew personally on their arrival. As before, the crew were awarded £1,000 prize money and several awards were promised. Unusually, the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> were unable to decide who among the ship's crew should receive the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> as all were deemed to have participated in the action with equal valour. It was thus decided for the first time, under article 13 of the Victoria Cross's royal warrant, that one officer and one enlisted man would be granted the award following a ballot by the ship's company. After the vote, from which Campbell abstained, the Victoria Crosses were awarded to Stuart and William Williams. Fourteen other crew members were awarded medals, including DSOs for Campbell and Hereford. In addition, every sailor had his participation in the action and subsequent ballot noted on his service records.

Due to the official secrecy surrounding the activities of the Q-ships, Stuart's and Williams's Victoria Crosses were announced without fanfare or explanation of their actions; even the "Pargust"s name was omitted from the citation. The full account of the action was not published until after the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany%20%28Compi%C3%A8gne%29">armistice</a> in November 1918. Stuart was noted as the first Anglo-Canadian to receive the Victoria Cross and his obituary later stated that in the action, "his gallantry stood out". The medal was presented to him in a ceremony at <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> by <a href="George%20V%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George V</a> on 23 July 1917.

In addition to receiving the Victoria Cross, Stuart was promoted to <a href="lieutenant%20commander">lieutenant commander</a> and given his own command, HMS "Tamarisk". "Tamarisk" was a small <a href="sloop">sloop</a> built in 1916 that was capable of being disguised as a merchant vessel and used as a Q-ship, designated Q11.

A few months after assuming command, on 15 October 1917, Stuart was on hand to rescue the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> destroyer <a href="USS%20Cassin%20%28DD-43%29">USS "Cassin"</a> after she was torpedoed by <a href="SM%20U-61">"U-61"</a> in heavy weather. Along with one crewmember killed and nine wounded, the "Cassin" had lost her entire stern including the rudder and was in danger of sinking. The dead crew member was <a href="Osmond%20Ingram">Osmond Ingram</a>, who had died throwing burning munitions overboard and was later posthumously awarded the <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medal of Honor</a>. Twenty miles from the Irish coast and in total darkness, the "Tamarisk" not only found the crippled ship but was able to come alongside in high seas and a strong <a href="gale">gale</a> and pass across a tow line. Twice during the night the tow broke and twice it was reconnected as the battle to save the ship continued. The next morning several trawlers came to the aid of the Q-ship and together they enabled the "Cassin" to make port, saving the ship and her crew. Ten years after the "Cassin's" rescue the US Navy awarded Stuart the <a href="Navy%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Navy Cross</a> in recognition of his part in the operation; it was a rare presentation to a sailor of a foreign navy and the only occasion in which the recipient also possessed the Victoria Cross.
The remainder of the war was quiet for Stuart, achieving no further successes against submarines. Upon the armistice the full details of his Victoria Cross action were revealed and, in 1919, he was <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a> in recognition of the service he had performed during the Q-ship operations. As further recognition of his overall efforts against the German submarine campaign, the French government presented him with the Croix de Guerre.

In 1919, Stuart returned to Canadian Pacific, his maritime reputation on both sides of the Atlantic greatly enhanced by his war record. In the same year he met and married his wife Evelyn, with whom he would have three sons and two daughters.

After post-war service on a succession of merchant ships, Stuart was provided with his first merchant command, the steam freighter SS "Brandon", in 1927. After a short period in charge, he was again promoted and transferred, taking up the role of staff captain on the liner <a href="RMS%20Empress%20of%20Australia%20%281919%29">RMS "Empress of Australia"</a>.

Just a year later he again moved, becoming full captain on the 15,000-ton liner <a href="SS%20Minnedosa">SS "Minnedosa"</a> – an older ship that transported immigrants to Canada. Stuart was one of a number of Royal Naval Reserve officers employed by Canadian Pacific, part of a deliberate recruitment policy by the company. In 1929, he was given his biggest command yet as he took over the newly completed 20,000-ton ocean liner <a href="SS%20Duchess%20of%20York%20%281928%29">SS "Duchess of York"</a>. He commanded her for five years along her route from Liverpool to <a href="Saint%20John%2C%20New%20Brunswick">Saint John, New Brunswick</a> stopping at <a href="Belfast">Belfast</a> and <a href="Greenock">Greenock</a>. He also briefly commanded her on the <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> to <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a> route. It was during this period, in 1929, that he was awarded the <a href="Decoration%20for%20Officers%20of%20the%20Royal%20Naval%20Reserve">Decoration for Officers of the Royal Naval Reserve</a> (RD) in honour of his long service and in 1935 he was made a full <a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Naval Reserve Captain</a>. He maintained his connection with the RNR throughout his life, becoming Honorary President of the RNR Officer's Club and a part-time naval "<a href="aide-de-camp">aide-de-camp</a>" to <a href="George%20VI%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George VI</a> in 1941 – a position he held part-time throughout <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. A special warrant was written in 1927 that allowed him to fly the <a href="Blue%20Ensign">Blue Ensign</a> from any ship, mercantile or military, which he commanded.

In 1931, while he was in command of the "Duchess of York", his wife suddenly died in <a href="Toxteth">Toxteth</a>. This event is said to have changed Stuart's demeanour and plunged him into a depression. He never again took time off work and left his children to the sole care and maintenance of his four maiden sisters in England. In 1934 he took over his last and most important seagoing role as <a href="Commodore%20%28rank%29">Commodore of the CPS fleet</a> and was placed in command of the 42,000-ton liner <a href="RMS%20Empress%20of%20Britain%20%281930%29">RMS "Empress of Britain"</a> on her transatlantic route.

After three years in command of this giant ship on her England to <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a> route, Stuart was given a desk job managing the company's assets in <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>. In 1937, he was promoted to company superintendent, a role followed by the job of general manager at Canadian Pacific's London office. He retained this job for 13 years, including through the difficult experiences of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> when London's dockyards were badly damaged by the <a href="London%20Blitz">London Blitz</a>. Two of his sons served in the war; one in the Royal Navy and the other in the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Navy">Royal Canadian Navy</a>. Both were decorated for bravery while fighting in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Atlantic">Battle of the Atlantic</a> against the resurgent German submarine fleet. One was presented with the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Service Cross</a>, while the other was <a href="Mentioned%20in%20Despatches">Mentioned in Despatches</a>.

Retiring in 1951, Stuart retreated to his sisters' cottage in <a href="Charing">Charing</a>, <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, and spent his days reading, walking, observing nature and visiting the cinema, where he was reportedly notorious for "jeering embarrassingly loudly at falsely heroic, sentimental or emotional passages" and shouting "Mush!" at parts of movies he did not approve. He died aged 67 at the cottage on 8 February 1954 and was buried in local Charing Cemetery. For many years his gravestone was in a poor state of repair, but successful attempts have been made by memorial organisations to replace it with a standard white <a href="Commonwealth%20War%20Grave">Commonwealth War Grave</a> headstone. Following his death, 'Stuart Close' in <a href="Lee-on-Solent">Lee-on-Solent</a> was named for him and his medals were collected and donated on permanent loan to the <a href="National%20Maritime%20Museum">National Maritime Museum</a>, where they are on display.

Baby Boy (Beyoncé song)

"Baby Boy" is a song by American singer <a href="Beyonc%C3%A9">Beyoncé</a> featuring Jamaican <a href="dancehall">dancehall</a> singer <a href="Sean%20Paul">Sean Paul</a> from Beyoncé's debut solo <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> "<a href="Dangerously%20in%20Love">Dangerously in Love</a>" (2003). Both artists co-wrote the song with <a href="Scott%20Storch">Scott Storch</a>, Robert Waller and <a href="Jay-Z">Shawn "Jay-Z" Carter</a>; the former also co-produced the song. Containing a lyrical interpolation of "No Fear" by <a href="Hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a> group <a href="Originoo%20Gunn%20Clappaz">O.G.C</a>, "Baby Boy" is an <a href="Contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> and <a href="dancehall">dancehall</a> song with <a href="Reggae%20music">reggae</a> and <a href="Arabic%20music">Arabic music</a> influences; its lyrics detail a woman's fantasies.

<a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a> and <a href="Music%20World%20Entertainment">Music World Entertainment</a> released "Baby Boy" as the second single from "Dangerously in Love" on August 3, 2003. "Baby Boy" topped the US <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> for nine consecutive weeks and was Beyoncé's longest-running solo number-one single until 2007, when it was surpassed by "<a href="Irreplaceable">Irreplaceable</a>". It reached the top ten in many countries and was certified platinum by the <a href="Australian%20Recording%20Industry%20Association">Australian Recording Industry Association</a> (ARIA) and the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA). It also reached the top 10 in Australia, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
The song's <a href="music%20video">music video</a> was directed by <a href="Jake%20Nava">Jake Nava</a> and mostly shows Beyoncé dancing in various locations. "Baby Boy" has remained a staple of Beyoncé's concert <a href="set%20list">set list</a>s. The <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Composers%2C%20Authors%20and%20Publishers">American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers</a> (ASCAP) recognized it as one of the most performed songs of 2004. In 2005, American <a href="singer-songwriter">singer-songwriter</a> Jennifer Armour filed a <a href="copyright%20infringement">copyright infringement</a> lawsuit claiming that the song had used the primary musical <a href="hook%20%28music%29">hook</a> from her song "Got a Little Bit of Love for You". The suit was later dismissed.

In 2002, Beyoncé went to <a href="Miami">Miami</a>, <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, in the United States, to work with American record producer <a href="Scott%20Storch">Scott Storch</a> for her debut solo studio album "<a href="Dangerously%20in%20Love">Dangerously in Love</a>". She and Storch wrote "Baby Boy", with contributions from American songwriter Robert Waller and Beyoncé's now-husband, <a href="Hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a> artist <a href="Jay-Z">Jay-Z</a>. The song also contains a lyrical interpolation of "No Fear" by hip hop group <a href="Originoo%20Gunn%20Clappaz">O.G.C.</a> used towards the ending of the song: "We steppin' in hotter this year".

Once the track was supposedly done, Beyoncé had the idea that it would be "perfect" if Jamaican <a href="reggae">reggae</a> artist <a href="Sean%20Paul">Sean Paul</a> contributed a vocal track. Beyoncé contacted Paul about a possible collaboration for "Baby Boy". Sean Paul agreed, and flew in from Jamaica to join the recording sessions of the song. He contributed a <a href="Deejay%20%28Jamaican%29">toast</a> verse, and they finished recording "Baby Boy" in March 2003, during the later stages of the album's recording.

"Baby Boy" is a <a href="Tempo">midtempo</a> <a href="contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">contemporary R&B</a> and <a href="dancehall">dancehall</a> song with <a href="reggae">reggae</a>, <a href="house%20music">house</a> and <a href="Arabic%20music">Arabic music</a> influences. It was composed using <a href="Time%20signature">common time</a> in the <a href="key%20%28music%29">key</a> of <a href="C%20minor">C minor</a>, and set in moderate <a href="groove%20%28music%29">groove</a> of 92 <a href="Tempo">beats per minute</a>. Storch's knowledge on <a href="Music%20of%20India">Indian</a> and <a href="Middle%20Eastern%20music">Middle Eastern music</a> contributes to its <a href="Music%20of%20Asia">Eastern</a> influences. <a href="Neil%20Drumming">Neil Drumming</a> of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" noted that "'Baby Boy' goes full-tilt <a href="Bollywood">Bollywood</a> 'n da hood, with Sean Paul ripping a pulsing <a href="tabla">tabla</a> <a href="raga">raga</a>". Beyoncé's vocals are accompanied by clicky and <a href="castanet">castanet</a>-sounding <a href="Beat%20%28music%29">beats</a>, <a href="Synthesizer">synthesized</a> <a href="Clapping">handclaps</a> and <a href="Slapping%20%28music%29">slaps</a>. According to Roger Friedman of <a href="Fox%20News%20Channel">Fox News Channel</a>, "Baby Boy" is based on the reggae song "<a href="Here%20Comes%20the%20Hotstepper">Here Comes the Hotstepper</a>" (1995), performed by Jamaican singer <a href="Ini%20Kamoze">Ini Kamoze</a>.

"Baby Boy" is considered to be a sequel to <a href="Jay-Z">Jay-Z</a>'s song "<a href="%2703%20Bonnie%20%26amp%3B%20Clyde">'03 Bonnie & Clyde</a>" (2002) featuring Beyoncé. The lyrics detail a woman's fantasies, and in keeping with the album's overall theme, Beyoncé's deemed them as personal to her. Paul remarked: "She's telling me about her fantasies and picturing me and her going here and there, all over the world ... I'm answering back, like, 'I'm wit it'." The lyrics are constructed in the toast–chorus–verse form; Sean Paul performs the toasting while Beyoncé sings all other <a href="Song%20structure%20%28popular%20music%29">verses</a> and <a href="refrain">choruses</a>. The pattern is repeated twice; a further chorus and verse follow, resolving at the toasting and final verse.

"Baby Boy" was released as the second single from Beyoncé's debut studio album, "<a href="Dangerously%20in%20Love">Dangerously in Love</a>" (2003). It was serviced to <a href="Contemporary%20hit%20radio">contemporary hit</a> and <a href="Rhythmic%20contemporary">rhythmic contemporary radio</a> in the United States on August 3, 2003. It was released as a <a href="CD%20single">CD single</a> and <a href="12-inch%20single">12-inch single</a> in the United Kingdom on October 6, 2003. The song was released for <a href="maxi%20single">maxi single</a> in Canada the following day, and in Germany on October 13. It was released in the United States as a 12-inch and CD single on October 14 and 28, 2003, respectively. "Baby Boy" was included in the revamped edition of Sean Paul's second studio album "<a href="Dutty%20Rock">Dutty Rock</a>" (2003).

In 2005, American singer–songwriter Jennifer Armour filed a <a href="copyright%20infringement">copyright infringement</a> <a href="lawsuit">lawsuit</a>, claiming that Beyoncé had used some lyrics and the musical <a href="hook%20%28music%29">hook</a> from her song "Got a Little Bit of Love for You". In 2003, Armour's former label manager had submitted <a href="demo%20%28music%29">demo recordings</a> to <a href="record%20label">record label</a>s, including Beyoncé's <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a> and Sean Paul's <a href="Atlantic%20Records">Atlantic Records</a>. According to the district court, an <a href="expert%20witness">expert witness</a> (Chair, Department of Music Theory & Composition, <a href="Shepherd%20School%20of%20Music">Shepherd School of Music</a>, <a href="Rice%20University">Rice University</a>) determined the songs to be "<a href="substantial%20similarity">substantially similar</a>" (a requirement for an infringement finding). With regard to the musical hook, the expert witness stated in his report: "When the aural comparisons of the two songs are presented in the key of <a href="C%20minor">C minor</a> (for easy comparison) and presented back-to-back, in A–B–A–B fashion, even the least musically inclined listener should immediately determine that the two songs are strikingly similar; I daresay that many listeners may even perceive them as being the same song! And again, transposing a song for this purpose does not alter any fundamental qualities or characteristics of the song but merely assists the ability of those unfamiliar with the technicalities of music in making a comparison." The district court judge nonetheless ruled that she, herself, couldn't hear the similarities between the two songs and dismissed the case, denying the motion for the songs or case to be heard by a jury. On appeal, the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Fifth%20Circuit">United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> affirmed the district court's ruling, but ruled with different reasoning. It held that there was no infringement based on Beyoncé's claim that Armour's demo tape was received shortly after the writing of Beyoncé's song had been substantially completed. However, the court did not address the issue of substantial similarity.

"<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine reviewer Anthony DeCurtis wrote that Beyoncé sounded as if she was "having fun" on the song, while <a href="Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine</a> of the online music guide service <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> described Beyoncé's vocals as "assured and sexy". <a href="Mark%20Anthony%20Neal">Mark Anthony Neal</a> of the international <a href="Online%20magazine">webzine</a> <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>, regarded "Baby Boy" as one of the "high-profile collaborations" on "Dangerously in Love". Lisa Verrico of the daily British newspaper "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" described the song a "<a href="Latino%20%28demonym%29">Latino</a>-tinged collaboration ... Paul does a reggae rap in the middle, but it's when he chats while Beyoncé half raps that the pair have real chemistry". Yancey Strickler of the "<a href="Flak%20Magazine">Flak</a>" magazine wrote that "'Baby Boy'<nowiki>'</nowiki>s <a href="Diwali%20Riddim">diwali</a> stutter is enhanced by Sean Paul's dancehall monotone".

James Anthony of the British newspaper "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" commented that the track "bridges the gap between the genres of R&B and dancehall". "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" writer Natalie Nichols wrote that "the ... house-spiced 'Baby Boy' successfully meld[s] [Beyoncé's] breathy cooing with hip, interesting production."

British record label <a href="EMI">EMI</a> was honored by the <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Composers%2C%20Authors%20and%20Publishers">American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers</a> (ASCAP) at the 2005 ASCAP Pop Music Awards as Publisher of the Year for publishing "Baby Boy", among other songs. <a href="Scott%20Storch">Scott Storch</a> earned Songwriter of the Year award at the same event.

"Baby Boy" attained a positioning on the commercial charts before its <a href="Compact%20Disc%20single">physical release</a> in the United States. The track led to a higher <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> chart placing for "Dangerously in Love", and helped the album to attain multi-platinum certification in the United States. The single debuted on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a>, at number fifty-seven, while its predecessor "<a href="Crazy%20in%20Love">Crazy in Love</a>" was still on the top spot. "Baby Boy" dominated the airplays in the United States, ultimately reaching the top of the "Billboard" Hot 100. It reached the chart's top spot eight weeks after its debut, and stayed there for nine consecutive weeks. The single stayed number one for a week longer than "Crazy in Love" had, becoming Beyoncé's longest-charting number-one single. The feat was not broken until her single "<a href="Irreplaceable">Irreplaceable</a>" (2006), from her second album "<a href="B%27Day%20%28Beyonc%C3%A9%20album%29">B'Day</a>" (2006), spent ten weeks at the top spot from late 2006 until early 2007 due to heavy airplay. "Baby Boy" stayed on the Hot 100 for twenty-nine weeks, and was certified <a href="RIAA%20certification">platinum</a> by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA) on June 6, 2006. "Baby Boy" achieved success on "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" <a href="crossover%20%28music%29">crossover</a> and <a href="mainstream%20radio">mainstream radio</a> charts, appearing on the <a href="Top%2040%20Tracks">Top 40 Tracks</a>, <a href="Rhythmic%20%28chart%29">Rhythmic</a> and <a href="Mainstream%20Top%2040">Mainstream Top 40</a>, as well as peaking atop the <a href="Hot%20100%20Airplay%20%28Radio%20Songs%29">Radio Songs</a> and <a href="Dance/Mix%20Show%20Airplay">Dance/Mix Show Airplay</a>, and at number two on <a href="Dance%20Club%20Songs">Dance Club Songs</a>. As of October 6, 2010, "Baby Boy" had sold 600,000 physical units in the United States.

Internationally, "Baby Boy" performed just as well, peaking inside the top ten on all of the charts it appeared on, excluding the <a href="%C3%963%20Austria%20Top%2040">Ö3 Austria Top 40</a>, <a href="Ultratop%2050">Ultratop 50 Wallonia</a> and <a href="Italian%20Singles%20Chart">Italian Singles Chart</a>,
on which it reached the top twenty. The single debuted at number two in the United Kingdom, becoming the chart's highest debut of the week and "Baby Boy"'s highest entry internationally. Even though it spent eleven weeks on the chart, it failed to reach the top, being held off by "<a href="Where%20Is%20the%20Love%3F">Where Is the Love?</a>" by <a href="The%20Black%20Eyed%20Peas">The Black Eyed Peas</a>. In Australia and New Zealand, "Baby Boy" peaked at numbers three and two, respectively. It was certified platinum by the <a href="Australian%20Recording%20Industry%20Association">Australian Recording Industry Association</a> (ARIA) for shipments in excess of 70,000 units.

The <a href="music%20video">music video</a> for "Baby Boy" was filmed by English director <a href="Jake%20Nava">Jake Nava</a>, who also shot Beyoncé's "Crazy in Love" video. It was recorded in <a href="Miami">Miami, Florida</a> on August 7–8, 2003. Parts of the video were captured in a house with different style rooms: one in a Japanese style and one in an old English style.

Scenes featuring Beyoncé and Paul are shown separately. The video begins with Paul sitting on a throne while <a href="Deejay%20%28Jamaican%29">toasting</a>; Beyoncé is leaning against a wall and dancing. In the following scene, Beyoncé is seen on a bed. Paul is shown with several women who are lying on the floor caressing each other. Beyoncé walks towards the beach; she spots a man, and the two touch and flirt. As the second verse of the begins, Beyoncé is at a party. At the party Beyoncé decides to dance with the same man that she interacted with earlier. Then, water floods the floor of the party as she sings "the dance floor becomes the sea". As the second chorus of the song begins, the video is cut with scenes of Beyoncé and four back-up dancers dancing on a platform in the sand on the beach. The original track is interrupted towards the end with an <a href="Arabic%20music">Arabic</a> instrumental, designed for the music video. This section showcases Beyoncé vigorously dancing on the sand.

Sal Cinquemani of the online publication <a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a>, described the video as a "baby-oil-logged follow-up" to "Crazy in Love"'s "bootylicous video". In 2013, John Boone and Jennifer Cady of <a href="E%21%20Online">E! Online</a> placed the video at number nine on their list of Beyoncé's ten best music videos, praising the extended belly-dancing breakdown. "Baby Boy" premiered on <a href="MTV">MTV</a>'s program "<a href="Total%20Request%20Live">Total Request Live</a>" on August 25, 2003 at number ten and reached the top spot. It stayed on the show for forty-one days, the same chart run "<a href="Me%2C%20Myself%20and%20I%20%28Beyonc%C3%A9%20song%29">Me, Myself and I</a>" earned.

Beyoncé first performed "Baby Boy" live at the <a href="2003%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">2003 MTV Video Music Awards</a>; she sang it in a <a href="List%20of%20musical%20medleys">medley</a> with the pre-recorded vocals of Paul. Beyoncé later sang "Baby Boy" with Paul at the <a href="MTV%20Europe%20Music%20Awards%202003">2003 MTV Europe Music Awards</a>. "Baby Boy" has been included on the <a href="set%20list">set list</a> for most of Beyoncé's concert tours. It served as opening song of her <a href="Dangerously%20in%20Love%20Tour">Dangerously in Love Tour</a> (2003). During her performance of the song on the tour, she was initially suspended from the ceiling of the arena that was gradually lowered to a red lounger—a prop she also used during the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. The footage taken at <a href="Wembley%20Arena">Wembley Arena</a> in <a href="London">London</a>, <a href="England">England</a> was included on Beyoncé's first <a href="live%20album">live album</a> "" (2004). Beyoncé also performed "Baby Boy" with her former group <a href="Destiny%27s%20Child">Destiny's Child</a> during their final tour <a href="Destiny%20Fulfilled...%20and%20Lovin%27%20It">Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It</a> (2005), and it was included on their second live album "" (2006).

"Baby Boy" was a part of Beyoncé's set list on <a href="The%20Beyonc%C3%A9%20Experience">The Beyoncé Experience</a> (2007) in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="California">California</a>, and on <a href="I%20Am...%20World%20Tour">I Am... World Tour</a> (2009–10).

A short section of <a href="Chaka%20Demus%20%26amp%3B%20Pliers">Chaka Demus & Pliers</a>' song "<a href="Murder%20She%20Wrote%20%28song%29">Murder She Wrote</a>" (1993) was incorporated into "Baby Boy". Jon Pareles of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" praised the performance, writing that Beyoncé "needs no distractions from her singing, which can be airy or brassy, tearful or vicious, rapid-fire with staccato syllables or sustained in curlicued melismas. But she was in constant motion, strutting in costumes". She performed in a similar arrangement at the Los Angeles' <a href="Staples%20Center">Staples Center</a> on September 2, 2007. She was dressed in a belly dancing outfit, and the performance was executed with several male backup dancers and live instrumentation. Beyoncé re-produced the dance she executed in the song's music video. When Beyoncé performed "Baby Boy" in <a href="Sunrise%2C%20Florida">Sunrise</a>, <a href="Florida">Florida</a> on June 29, 2009, she was wearing a glittery gold leotard.

Animated graphics of turntables, faders and other club equipment were projected behind the dancers and musicians. Beyoncé was accompanied by her backing band Suga Mama, which consisted of two drummers, two keyboardists, a percussionist, a horn section, three imposing backup vocalists and the lead guitarist Bibi McGill. "Baby Boy" was included on her live album "<a href="The%20Beyonc%C3%A9%20Experience%20Live">The Beyoncé Experience Live</a>" (2007), and the deluxe edition of "<a href="I%20Am...%20World%20Tour">I Am... World Tour</a>" (2010). At the 2005 <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Composers%2C%20Authors%20and%20Publishers">ASCAP Pop Music Awards</a>, "Baby Boy", along with Beyoncé's two other singles from "Dangerously in Love" – "Me, Myself and I" and "<a href="Naughty%20Girl%20%28Beyonc%C3%A9%20song%29">Naughty Girl</a>" – was recognized as one of the most performed songs of 2004.

"Baby Boy" was performed by Beyoncé in a pink fringe dress at a concert at <a href="Palais%20Nikaia">Palais Nikaïa</a> in <a href="Nice%2C%20France">Nice</a>, France, on June 20, 2011, and at the <a href="Glastonbury%20Festival%202011">Glastonbury Festival</a> on June 26, 2011, where she brought out British <a href="trip%20hop">trip hop</a> singer <a href="Tricky%20%28musician%29">Tricky</a> to guest on the song. Between May 25–28, 2012, Beyoncé performed the song during her "" <a href="revue">revue</a> at <a href="entertainment">entertainment</a> <a href="resort">resort</a>, <a href="hotel">hotel</a>, <a href="casino">casino</a> and <a href="spa">spa</a> <a href="Revel%20Atlantic%20City">Revel</a> in <a href="Atlantic%20City">Atlantic City</a>, <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>.

Aiphanes

Aiphanes is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="thorns%2C%20spines%2C%20and%20prickles">spiny</a> <a href="Arecaceae">palms</a> which is native to <a href="tropics">tropical</a> regions of <a href="South%20America">South</a> and <a href="Central%20America">Central America</a> and the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>. There are about 26 <a href="List%20of%20Aiphanes%20species">species in the genus</a> (see below), ranging in size from <a href="understory">understorey</a> shrubs with subterranean stems to <a href="canopy%20%28biology%29">subcanopy</a> trees as tall as . Most have <a href="pinnate">pinnate</a>ly compound leaves (leaves which are divided into leaflets arranged feather-like, in pairs along a central axis); one species has <a href="Leaf%20shape">entire</a> leaves. Stems, leaves and sometimes even the fruit are covered with spines. Plants flower repeatedly over the course of their lifespan and have separate male and female flowers, although these are borne together on the same <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>. Although records of pollinators are limited, most species appear to be pollinated by insects. The fruit are eaten by several birds and mammals, including at least two species of <a href="amazon%20parrot">amazon parrot</a>s.

<a href="Carl%20Ludwig%20Willdenow">Carl Ludwig Willdenow</a> coined the name "Aiphanes" in 1801. Before that, species belonging to the genus had been placed in "<a href="Bactris">Bactris</a>" or "<a href="Caryota">Caryota</a>". The name "Martinezia" had also been applied to the genus, and between 1847 and 1932 it was generally used in place of "Aiphanes". <a href="Max%20Burret">Max Burret</a> resurrected the name "Aiphanes" in 1932, and laid the basis for the modern concept of the genus. "Aiphanes" is most closely related to several other genera of spiny palms—"<a href="Acrocomia">Acrocomia</a>", "<a href="Astrocaryum">Astrocaryum</a>", "Bactris" and "<a href="Desmoncus">Desmoncus</a>". Two species are widely planted as <a href="ornamental%20plant">ornamentals</a> and the fruit, seeds or <a href="heart%20of%20palm">palm heart</a> of several species have been eaten by <a href="indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">indigenous peoples of the Americas</a> for millennia.

"Aiphanes" is a genus of spiny palms ranging from tall subcanopy trees to small shrubs with subterranean stems growing in the forest understorey. Its name combines the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "ai", meaning "always", with "phaneros", meaning "evident", "visible" or "conspicuous". In their 1996 <a href="monograph">monograph</a> on the genus, botanists Finn Borchsenius and <a href="Rodrigo%20Bernal">Rodrigo Bernal</a> pointed out that "ironically, species of "Aiphanes" are generally very hard to spot and find in dense vegetation and, accordingly, are among the most poorly collected neotropical palms".

While some species are single-stemmed, others form multi-stemmed (<a href="caespitose">caespitose</a>) clumps. Coupled with variation in stem size, this produces a diversity of growth forms in the genus—solitary (single-stemmed) palms that grow into the subcanopy of the forest, solitary or caespitose palms that grow in the forest understorey and <a href="acaulescent">acaulescent</a> palms which lack an aboveground stem.

Two species are characterised by an growth habit—"<a href="Aiphanes%20acaulis">A. acaulis</a>" and "<a href="Aiphanes%20spicata">A. spicata</a>". Two other species—"<a href="Aiphanes%20ulei">A. ulei</a>" and "<a href="Aiphanes%20weberbaueri">A. weberbaueri</a>"—occur in both acaulescent populations and those which produce above-ground stems. Several species are single-stemmed understorey palms, an unusual growth form. "<a href="Aiphanes%20grandis">Aiphanes grandis</a>" and "<a href="Aiphanes%20minima">A. minima</a>" are single-stemmed palms which grow to be more than tall, while the remainder are multi-stemmed understorey species. Multi-stemmed palms range from plants with a single main stem and a few <a href="Basal%20shoot">basal sucker</a>s to caespitose clumps of 20 densely packed stems. A variety of growth forms can exist within a single species and this appears to be influenced by habitat and environmental conditions.

The leaves of "Aiphanes" species are usually pinnately divided—rows of leaflets emerge on either side of the axis of the leaf in a feather-like or fern-like pattern. The sole exception to this is "<a href="Aiphanes%20macroloba">A. macroloba</a>" which has <a href="entire%20leaf">entire</a> leaves. They are usually spirally arranged, but some species have a <a href="Phyllotaxis%23Pattern%20structure">distichous</a> leaf arrangement, a condition that is normal in palm seedlings but uncommon among adults. Old leaf bases detach cleanly from the stem, except in <a href="Aiphanes%20hirsuta">"A. hirsuta" subsp. "fosteriorum"</a>, which often has old leaf bases attached to the newer portions of the stem.

Leaves are spiny but the degree varies both within and among species. Leaf sheaths are always densely spiny but the spines usually become smaller and sparser towards the ends of the leaves.

<a href="Thorns%2C%20spines%2C%20and%20prickles">Spines</a> are characteristic of "Aiphanes" and other members of the <a href="tribe%20%28biology%29">subtribe</a> <a href="Bactridinae">Bactridinae</a>. They are found almost everywhere on the plants and are especially well-developed on the stem, leaf bases, and the <a href="peduncle%20%28botany%29">peduncle</a>. In "Aiphanes", the spines are formed from the outer tissues of the plant and are not derived through the modification of other plant organs. They range from less than to more than long.

"Aiphanes" species are pleonanthic—they flower repeatedly over the course of their lifespan—and <a href="Plant%20sexuality">monoecious</a>, meaning that there are separate male and female flowers, but individuals plants bear both types of flowers. In "Aiphanes", male and female flowers are borne together on the same <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>. Usually only a single inflorescence is borne at each <a href="Plant%20stem">node</a>, although "<a href="Aiphanes%20gelatinosa">A. gelatinosa</a>" often bears then in groups of three at a single node. The inflorescence usually consists of a main axis consisting of a peduncle and a <a href="rachis">rachis</a>. The rachis bears rachillae, which are smaller branches which themselves bear the flowers, while the peduncle is the main stalk connecting the rachis with the stem of the plant. In some species there is second-order branching—the rachillae themselves are branched and the flowers are borne on these branches.

Flowers are usually borne in groups of three—one female flower together with two male flowers. In some species groups of four flowers (two male and two female) have been reported. At the far end of the inflorescence, away from the axis of the tree, pairs of male flowers replace the triads of male and female flowers. Flower colour is poorly known. It must be recorded from live plants, since preserved flowers lose their colour over time, and records of these species in the wild are incomplete. Male flowers tend to fall into two groups—those with cream or yellow flowers and those with some amount of purple in the flowers. Female flowers are even less well known than male flowers.

Pollen grains are usually spherical to ellipsoid in shape, sometimes triangular, about 20 to 30 micrometres along their long axis and 20 to 30 µm in diameter. They are typically <a href="monosulcate">monosulcate</a>, <a href="meridionosulcate">meridionosulcate</a> or more rarely <a href="trichotomosulcate">trichotomosulcate</a>. The <a href="sulcus%20%28anatomy%29">sulcus</a> is a furrow which runs along the surface of the pollen grain and is usually the site at which pollination occurs. Monosulcate pollen has a single furrow that runs along the pole of the pollen grain. Meridionosulcate pollen have a furrow that runs along the equator of the pollen grain. Trichotomosulcate pollen, on the other hand, has three furrows. The outer layer of the pollen is covered to a greater or lesser extent with ridges, spines or warts. This "sculpting" tends to be more pronounced in species that are fly-pollinated and less pronounced in those that are pollinated by beetles or bees.

The fruit of "Aiphanes" species is usually a red, spherical, single-seeded <a href="drupe">drupe</a>. A thin skin (or <a href="Fruit%20anatomy%23Exocarp">epicarp</a>), which can be either smooth or spiny, covers the fleshy <a href="Fruit%20anatomy%23Mesocarp">mesocarp</a>, which is typically orange and sweet. The mesocarp of "<a href="Aiphanes%20horrida">A. horrida</a>" has one of the highest reported <a href="carotene">carotene</a> contents of any plant product and is also rich in <a href="protein%20%28nutrient%29">protein</a>. The <a href="Fruit%20anatomy%23Endocarp">endocarp</a>, which encases the seed, is brown or black and very hard at maturity. Seeds are light brown with a thin <a href="Seed%23Seed%20structure">seed coat</a> (or testa) and white <a href="endosperm">endosperm</a>, which is sweet and tastes somewhat like <a href="coconut">coconut</a>.

Published <a href="karyotype">chromosome counts</a> exist for two species, "Aiphanes minima" and "A. horrida"; <a href="haploid">haploid</a> chromosome counts vary from 15 to 18. Borchsenius and Bernal report that it is difficult to get accurate chromosome counts in palms and that differences in chromosome counts may reflect these difficulties.

"Aiphanes" is placed in the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">subfamily</a> <a href="Arecoideae">Arecoideae</a>, the <a href="tribe%20%28biology%29">tribe</a> <a href="Cocoseae">Cocoseae</a> and the subtribe Bactridinae, together with the genera "<a href="Desmoncus">Desmoncus</a>", "<a href="Bactris">Bactris</a>", "<a href="Acrocomia">Acrocomia</a>" and "<a href="Astrocaryum">Astrocaryum</a>".

In his 1932 revision of the genus, German botanist <a href="Max%20Burret">Max Burret</a> recognised 32 species. Seventeen of these were new species, mostly based on collections made by German botanist <a href="Guillermo%20Kalbreyer">Wilhelm Kalbreyer</a> in northern Colombia between 1877 and 1881. Working with a very narrow <a href="Species%23Definitions%20of%20species">species concept</a>, and not being familiar with the variation present in natural populations, Burret placed almost every specimen into a distinct species. The bombing of the Berlin Herbarium during the Second World War destroyed the only known collections for 13 of these 32 species, further complicating the situation.

The <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Botanical%20Nomenclature">International Code of Botanical Nomenclature</a> requires each species to be represented by a <a href="type%20%28biology%29">type collection</a>. The destruction of Burret's type collections left many species only known from his original descriptions, which generally lacked illustrations. Other specimens (called neotypes) were designated to replace these, either by Rodrigo Bernal and colleagues in 1989 or by Borchsenius and Bernal in their 1996 monograph of the genus. Bernal and colleagues attempted to retrace Kalbreyer's travels in northern Colombia and collect specimens from as close as possible to the location of the original collections.

Burret divided "Aiphanes" into two subgenera, "Brachyanthera" and "Macroanthera". Eleven species were placed in "Macroanthera", while the remainder were placed in "Brachyanthera". In their 1996 monograph, Borchsenius and Bernal questioned the applicability of these subgenera. They recognised that if "Macroanthera" was reduced to three species ("A. horrida", "<a href="Aiphanes%20eggersii">A. eggersii</a>" and "A. minima") it could form a viable grouping, but that this would leave "Brachyanthera" overly heterogeneous. Consequently, they abandoned Burret's use of subgenera.

In the three decades following Burret's delimitation of the genus a further 15 species were described, bringing the total species count to 47. Borchsenius and Bernal determined that <a href="List%20of%20Aiphanes%20species">many of these names were synonyms</a>, although American botanist <a href="George%20Proctor%20%28botanist%29">George Proctor</a> disagreed with their decision to lump "A. acanthophylla" into "A. minima". Borchsenius and Bernal also described one new species, "Aiphanes spicata", bringing the total number of accepted species to 22. In two cases the destruction of the only known collections made it impossible to be absolutely certain that a name was a synonym. The current "World Checklist of Selected Plant Families", maintained by Rafaël Govaerts at the <a href="Royal%20Botanic%20Gardens%2C%20Kew">Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew</a>, recognises 26 species, including four species described since the publication of Borchsenius and Bernal's monograph.

Burret divided "Aiphanes" into two subgenera, "Brachyanthera" and "Macroanthera". Eleven species were placed in "Macroanthera", with the remainder in "Brachyanthera". In their 1996 monograph, Borchsenius and Bernal questioned the applicability of these subgenera. They recognised that if "Macroanthera" was reduced to three species ("A. horrida", "<a href="Aiphanes%20eggersii">A. eggersii</a>" and "A. minima") it could form a viable grouping, but that this would leave "Brachyanthera" overly heterogeneous. Consequently, they abandoned Burret's use of subgenera.

The earliest botanical description of a species in the genus was made by French botanist <a href="Charles%20Plumier">Charles Plumier</a>, who described two species based on his visits to the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a> between 1689 and 1695. Both of Plumier's species are now considered to be "Aiphanes minima". The same species was described by Dutch botanist <a href="Nikolaus%20Joseph%20von%20Jacquin">Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin</a> in 1763. Spanish botanist <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Celestino%20Mutis">José Celestino Mutis</a> produced a detailed description of "<a href="Aiphanes%20lindeniana">A. lindeniana</a>" and illustrations of that species and what is thought to be "A. horrida" in 1779.

In 1791 <a href="Joseph%20Gaertner">Joseph Gaertner</a> included a species of "Aiphanes" in his "<a href="De%20Fructibus%20et%20Seminibus%20Plantarum">De Fructibus et Seminibus Plantarum</a>", calling it "Bactris minima". This is the oldest validly published name for any member of the genus. The name "Aiphanes" was coined by German botanist <a href="Carl%20Ludwig%20Willdenow">Carl Ludwig Willdenow</a> in 1801. He described a single species, "A. aculeata", in 1806.

Jacquin had used the name "<a href="Caryota">Caryota</a> horrida" to describe a plant that belonged to the same species (and may have been the same individual) described by Willdenow. Borchsenius and Bernal cite an 1809 publication date for Jacquin's description, which gave precedence to Willdenow's name. However, the more recent World Checklist (2006) gives an 1801 publication date for Jacquin's description, making "A. horrida" the correct name for the species.

In 1816 <a href="Alexander%20von%20Humboldt">Alexander von Humboldt</a>, <a href="Aim%C3%A9%20Bonpland">Aimé Bonpland</a> and <a href="Carl%20Sigismund%20Kunth">Carl Sigismund Kunth</a> described "Martinezia caryotifolia", adding another name to the list of <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonyms</a> for "A. horrida". Since the original diagnostic characters of "Martinezia" did not fit any existent species, it was redefined by Kunth to fit "M. caryotifolia". Consequently, "Martinezia" came to replace "Aiphanes" and the latter name was rarely used between 1847 and 1932. In 1857 <a href="Gustav%20Karl%20Wilhelm%20Hermann%20Karsten">Hermann Karsten</a> created a new genus, "Marara", to accommodate two Colombian species, "M. bicuspidata" (later shown to be a synonym for "A. horrida") and "M. erinacea" (now "<a href="Aiphanes%20erinacea">A. erinacea</a>"). <a href="Hermann%20Wendland">Hermann Wendland</a> attempted to resurrect "Aiphanes" in 1878, merging "Martinezia" and "Marara" into it, but his proposal was ignored. In 1901 <a href="Orator%20F.%20Cook">Orator F. Cook</a> created two new genera—"Curima", into which he put "A. minima", and "Tilmia", which housed "A. horrida". In 1932, after publishing a species in "Martinezia", Burret changed his mind about the genus and synonymised it with "Aiphanes". This led to the current delimitation of the genus.

Species accepted by the <a href="World%20Checklist%20of%20Selected%20Plant%20Families">World Checklist of Selected Plant Families</a>:

The genus "Aiphanes" ranges from the <a href="Dominican%20Republic">Dominican Republic</a> and <a href="Panama">Panama</a> in the north, to <a href="Trinidad%20and%20Tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</a> in the east, across <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a> and down along the <a href="Andes">Andes</a> to <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>. In <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a> it only occurs along the border with <a href="Peru">Peru</a>. "Aiphanes" is primarily South American—one species ("<a href="Aiphanes%20hirsuta">A. hirsuta</a>") is present in Panama and two others ("A. horrida" and "A. minima") are found in the Caribbean. "Aiphanes minima", which is <a href="endemism">endemic</a> to the insular Caribbean, is the only species absent from the South American mainland. Although "A. horrida" has been reported from <a href="Guyana">Guyana</a> and southern Venezuela these reports have not been verified with <a href="herbarium">herbarium</a> vouchers.

"Aiphanes horrida" is the most widely distributed species. It ranges from <a href="Trinidad">Trinidad</a> to Bolivia but is absent from <a href="Ecuador">Ecuador</a> and northern Peru. Other species have narrower ranges with one <a href="center%20of%20diversity">centre of diversity</a> in western Colombia and Ecuador and another minor one in northeastern Peru. The 2006 <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> includes three species which are <a href="endangered%20species%23IUCN%20Red%20List%20endangered%20species">endangered</a> by habitat destruction—"A. grandis", "<a href="Aiphanes%20leiostachys">A. leiostachys</a>" and "<a href="Aiphanes%20verrucosa">A verrucosa</a>"—and three others considered <a href="vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a> to the same threat—"<a href="Aiphanes%20chiribogensis">A. chiribogensis</a>", "<a href="Aiphanes%20duquei">A. duquei</a>" and "A. lindeniana". Rodrigo Bernal and <a href="Gloria%20Galeano">Gloria Galeano</a> expanded this list in a 2005 review of the status of Colombian palms. They listed two species as <a href="critically%20endangered%20species">critically endangered</a>—"<a href="Aiphanes%20graminifolia">A. graminifolia</a>", a species that was first described in 2002, and "A. leiostachys" (which was classified as endangered in the IUCN Red List). They classified two species as endangered—"A. acaulis" and "<a href="Aiphanes%20parvifolia">A. parvifolia</a>"—and two species as vulnerable—"A. gelatinosa" and "<a href="Aiphanes%20pilaris">A. pilaris</a>". They also classified six species as <a href="near%20threatened">near threatened</a>—"A. erinacea", "A. hirsuta", "A. lindeniana" (vulnerable according to the IUCN Red List), "<a href="Aiphanes%20linearis">A. linearis</a>", "A. macroloba" and "<a href="Aiphanes%20simplex">A. simplex</a>". The threats to these species were not listed, but Jens-Christian Svenning reported that "A. erinacea" was threatened by logging given its limited distribution and poor ability to regenerate in disturbed forests. In addition to these, "<a href="Aiphanes%20deltoidea">A. deltoidea</a>", which is widely distributed across the western <a href="Amazon%20Rainforest">Amazon Rainforest</a>, is present at such low densities that it was classified as a rare species by Francis Kahn and Farana Moussa in 1994.

"Aiphanes" species are palms of the forest understorey and subcanopy. The most widely distributed species, "A. horrida", occurs both in <a href="tropical%20dry%20forest">tropical dry forest</a> and in more humid forest types, but there is a gap in its distribution which coincides with the wettest forests of the upper <a href="Amazon%20Basin">Amazon Basin</a>. Two other species, "A. minima" and "A. eggersii", are also found in drier environments; "A. eggersii" is found in areas receiving as little as of precipitation annually. The remaining species are found in <a href="cloud%20forest">montane</a> forests at high elevations or in wet—often very wet—lowland forests, including areas receiving as much as of annual precipitation.

Records of visits by <a href="pollinator">pollinator</a>s exist for only a few species, but most of these suggest that the species are pollinated by insects. Flowers of "A. chiribogensis" produce small quantities of <a href="nectar">nectar</a>, but lack a scent. Fruit flies (<a href="Drosophilidae">Drosophilidae</a>), <a href="fungus%20gnat">fungus gnat</a>s (<a href="Mycetophilidae">Mycetophilidae</a>, <a href="Sciaridae">Sciaridae</a>), midges (<a href="Cecidomyiidae">Cecidomyiidae</a>, <a href="Ceratopogonidae">Ceratopogonidae</a>) and micromoths (<a href="Lepidoptera">Lepidoptera</a>) were recorded visiting these flowers, but <a href="bee">bee</a>s and <a href="hover%20fly">hover flies</a> were not. "Aiphanes eggersii" was thought to be pollinated by bees and possibly by wind. Fruit flies (<a href="Drosophilidae">Drosophilidae</a>), <a href="hoverfly">hover flies</a> (Syrphidae), biting midges (<a href="Ceratopogonidae">Ceratopogonidae</a>) and <a href="leaf%20beetle">leaf beetle</a>s (Chrysomelidae) were recorded visiting the flowers of "A. erinacea", but bees were not. "Aiphanes horrida" was reportedly pollinated by wind, bees (<a href="Meliponidae">Meliponidae</a>), weevils (<a href="Curculionidae">Curculionidae</a>) and bugs (<a href="Hemiptera">Hemiptera</a>). Flies and weevils were observed on the flowers of "A. simplex".

The fruit of "A. horrida" is rich in vitamins and energy and likely to be eaten by many animals. <a href="Oilbird">Oilbird</a>s are reported to eat its fruit and disperse its seeds. Squirrels are also reported to consume the fruit, despite the spiny nature of the tree. The fruit, flowers and seeds of "A. minima" are consumed by the <a href="vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a> <a href="Saint%20Vincent%20amazon">Saint Vincent amazon</a> ("Amazona guildingii") and is also considered a potentially important food species for the <a href="critically%20endangered">critically endangered</a> <a href="Puerto%20Rican%20amazon">Puerto Rican amazon</a> ("Amazona vittata").

Several species show clumped distributions. Dispersal limitation has been invoked to explain the clumped distribution of adults and limited recruitment of seedlings in both "A. erinacea" in Ecuador and "A. minima" in Puerto Rico. Similarly, the rarity of "A. lindeniana" and "A. simplex" in Colombian forests may be linked to limited seed production and the limited effectiveness of seed dispersal by avian and mammalian frugivores.

"Aiphanes" species have a long history of human use. The remains of carbonised seeds thought to belong to "A. horrida" have been found in archaeological sites in <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a> dating back to about 2800 <a href="Before%20Present">BP</a>; seeds of this species are still consumed and are traded in local markets. "Aiphanes horrida" is also widely planted as an ornamental, as is "A. minima". The fruit or seeds of "A. deltoidea", "A. eggersii", "A. linearis" and "A. minima" are all consumed locally. The <a href="heart%20of%20palm">palm heart</a> of "A. macroloba" is consumed by the <a href="Awa-Cuaiquer%20language">Coaiquer</a> people of northwestern South America. <a href="Aiphanol">Aiphanol</a>, a compound isolated from "A. horrida", has shown significant <a href="enzyme%20inhibitor">inhibitory</a> activity against <a href="cyclooxygenase">cyclooxygenase</a>s; inhibition of these enzymes can provide relief from the symptoms of <a href="inflammation">inflammation</a> and pain.

Bramall Hall

Bramall Hall is a largely <a href="Tudor%20style%20architecture">Tudor</a> <a href="manor%20house">manor house</a> in <a href="Bramhall">Bramhall</a>, within the <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Stockport">Metropolitan Borough of Stockport</a>, Greater Manchester, England. It is a <a href="Timber%20framing">timber-framed</a> building, the oldest parts of which date from the 14th century, with later additions from the 16th and 19th centuries. The house, which functions as a museum, and its of landscaped parkland with lakes, woodland, and gardens (Bramhall Park) are open to the public.

Dating back to <a href="History%20of%20Anglo-Saxon%20England">Anglo-Saxon England</a>, the manor of Bramall was first described in the "<a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a>" in 1086, when it was held by the Masseys. From the late 14th century it was owned by the Davenports who built the present house, and remained lords of the manor for about 500 years before selling the estate of nearly 2,000 acres in 1877 to the Manchester Freeholders' Company, a property company formed expressly for the purpose of exploiting the estate's potential for residential building development. The Hall and a residual park of over 50 acres was sold on by the Freeholders (though not the lordship of the manor) to the Nevill family of successful industrialists. In 1925 it was purchased by <a href="John%20Henry%20Davies">John Henry Davies</a>, and then, in 1935, acquired by the local government authority for the area, Hazel Grove and Bramhall Urban District Council. Following local government reorganisation in 1974, Bramall Hall is now owned by <a href="Stockport%20Metropolitan%20Borough%20Council">Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council</a> (SMBC), which describes it as "the most prestigious and historically significant building in the Conservation Area".

The name "Bramall" means "nook of land where broom grows" and is derived from the <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> noun "brōm" meaning <a href="broom%20%28shrub%29">broom</a>, a type of shrub common in the area, and the Old English noun "halh", which has several meanings—including nook, secret place and valley—that could refer to Bramall. The manor of Bramall dates from the <a href="History%20of%20Anglo-Saxon%20England">Anglo-Saxon period</a>, when it was held as two separate estates owned by the <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> freemen Brun and Hacun. The manor was devastated during <a href="William%20the%20Conqueror">William the Conqueror</a>'s <a href="Harrying%20of%20the%20North">Harrying of the North</a>. After William subdued the north-west of England, the land was divided among his followers and Bramall was given to <a href="Hamon%20de%20Massey">Hamon de Massey</a> in around 1070.

The earliest reference to Bramall was recorded in the "<a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a>" as "Bramale" at which time the manor was part of the <a href="Hundreds%20of%20Cheshire">Hamestan Hundred</a> in Cheshire. With <a href="Cheadle%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Cheadle</a> and <a href="Norbury%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Norbury</a>, Bramall was one of three places described in the "Domesday Book" that today lie within the modern-day <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Stockport">Metropolitan Borough of Stockport</a>. While its value was 32 shillings before 1066, it was worth only 5 shillings by 1086.

In the first part of the 12th century, the manor passed from the second <a href="Baron%20of%20Dunham%20Massey">Baron of Dunham Massey</a> to Matthew de Bromale. According to Dean, Matthew's father is said to have founded the de Bromale family, naming himself after the manor, and he may have been related to or a follower of the de Masseys. He may have also held the manor at some point. The de Bromales held the manor until 1370 when Alice de Bromale married <a href="John%20de%20Davenport">John de Davenport</a>, and the family name was changed.

The Davenports were a family of significant landowners in the north-west of England whose antecedents can be traced back to the time of the <a href="Norman%20conquest">Norman conquest</a>. Orm de Davenport lived close to what is now <a href="Marton%2C%20Cheshire">Marton</a>, and his name derives from the <a href="Norman%20language">Norman French</a> "Dauen-port" meaning "the town on the trickling stream", referring to his home on the <a href="River%20Dane">River Dane</a>. In 1160, the family became responsible for <a href="Macclesfield%20Forest">Macclesfield Forest</a>, and in the early 13th century Vivian Davenport became its Grand Sergeant. The family's <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a> includes a man's head with a rope around the neck, which is said to represent the family's power over life and death during this period. The Davenports acquired land throughout the area, notably at <a href="Wheltrough">Wheltrough</a>, <a href="Henbury%2C%20Cheshire">Henbury</a>, <a href="Woodford%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Woodford</a> and lastly at Bramhall through marriage.

The Davenports held the manor for around 500 years, and it is likely that they built the current house after their accession. The first William Davenport was lord of the manor from 1478 to 1528, and one of the first recorded trustees of <a href="Macclesfield%20Grammar%20School">Macclesfield Grammar School</a>. It is possible that he was heavily involved in the final battle of the <a href="Wars%20of%20the%20Roses">Wars of the Roses</a> at <a href="Battle%20of%20Bosworth">Bosworth</a> and thereby instrumental in gaining the crown for <a href="Henry%20VII%20of%20England">Henry VII</a>, who rewarded him with a pension of 20 marks per year payable for his lifetime. According to Dean, it was during this first William's tenure that Bramall may have been vandalised by a man named Randle Hassall, who destroyed all or part of nine houses and stole the timber. This gives credence to the theory that Bramall was rebuilt, replacing or partially replacing an older building.

The third William Davenport, who succeeded his father of the same name in 1541, took part in what later became known as <a href="The%20Rough%20Wooing">The Rough Wooing</a>, a series of attacks against Scotland ordered by <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a>. He was knighted in Scotland for his efforts at the <a href="Burning%20of%20Edinburgh%20%281544%29">burning of Edinburgh in May 1544</a>. The fifth William Davenport inherited Bramall in 1585 from his father of the same name, and lived there with his wife Dorothy for over 50 years. The first marriage in Bramall's chapel was recorded in 1599, between William (aged 15), eldest son of the fifth William and Dorothy, and Frances Wilbraham (aged 11). On 22 April 1603 the fifth William Davenport was knighted by <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">James I</a> at <a href="Newark-on-Trent">Newark</a> (where the king was staying on his journey from Edinburgh to London) and later became the High Sheriff of Cheshire and a commissioner of the Hundred of Macclesfield. During the tenure of the fifth William, many alterations were made to the building, including the addition of a room above the Great Hall (which would later become the Withdrawing Room), and a <a href="long%20gallery">long gallery</a>. The internal decorations were also updated with additions such as wall paintings and portraits.

The sixth William succeeded his father in 1639 shortly before the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a> broke out. He was a <a href="Royalist">Royalist</a>, though said not to have been a particularly dedicated one. Many of his tenants became Parliamentarian soldiers, and over the next three years he had numerous visits from Parliamentarian soldiers, mostly seeking to acquire goods such as horses and weapons for the war, and using the house for quartering soldiers. Bramall was also host to Royalist soldiers, who confiscated some of the Davenport property for use in the war. William Davenport was at one point charged with <a href="Felony">delinquency</a>, and ordered to pay a fine of £750 (equivalent to £ in 2019), and soldiers continued to use Bramall Hall because of its convenience.

The sixth William was briefly succeeded by his son Peter, who was followed by his son William. William the seventh's son was the eighth William Davenport, and an inventory of his property made shortly after his death in 1706 shows the gallery and gatehouse of Bramall were still intact. His two eldest sons each inherited the estate but both died young and heirless, so the estate passed to their younger brother Warren Davenport. Warren became part of the clergy, and during his tenure at Bramall set up a school close to the entrance of the estate. The tenth and final William Davenport succeeded his father, Warren at the age of four. Many changes were made to the house during his tenure, including the dismantling of the gatehouse side of the courtyard and the long gallery, the latter of which may have been done because of their being considered unsafe. William had no sons, so the estate passed to <a href="Salusbury%20Pryce%20Humphreys">Salusbury Pryce Humphreys</a>, the husband of his illegitimate daughter Maria.

Humphreys, a Naval captain, had married Maria Davenport in 1810, and lived at Bramall Hall long before he succeeded his father-in-law. He became widely respected in the Stockport area, but following his succession to the estate in 1829, there were disputes from other members of the Davenport family who claimed a right to the property. Edmund Davenport, who claimed ancestry from Thomas Davenport, the third son of Peter, unsuccessfully contested the succession in two different courts; Edmund was eventually imprisoned for failing to pay the legal fees. Humphreys was knighted in 1834 for his services, and in 1838 changed his name to Davenport, in an effort to continue the Davenport line. He moved with Maria to <a href="Cheltenham">Cheltenham</a> in 1841, most likely because living at Bramall had become expensive or because of health concerns. Salusbury died there four years later and was buried in <a href="Leckhampton">Leckhampton</a>.

Over the next decade the house was likely to have been let, as Maria Davenport preferred to live elsewhere. Her eldest son, William Davenport Davenport married firstly to Camilla Maria Gatt, then secondly to Diana Handley, whom he lived with at Bramall for four years before the estate was passed to him. Maria moved to London where she lived with her youngest son, Charles, and died in 1866. During William's tenure Bramall was regularly visited by members of the public, and the Chapel continued to be used for regular services of worship. However, following his death in 1869, the property was let to <a href="Wakefield%20Christy">Wakefield Christy</a> of Christys & Co Hatting, therefore ending direct involvement from the Davenport family. This occurred because William's son, John, was too young to inherit the estate. John's whereabouts during Christy's seven-year tenure is unknown, though he was shown as a visitor at Bramall in 1871, and in 1874 became the first chairman of the Bramhall School Board. In 1876, shortly before he returned to the house, he was listed as living on Ack Lane in Bramhall.

John Davenport returned to Bramall in 1876 at the age of 25, but on 24 January 1877 it was announced that the estate was to be sold. The furniture was auctioned, while the house itself and rest of the Bramall estate (totalling ) was sold to the Freeholders Company Limited, a <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> property development firm, on 3 August 1877 for £200,000 (about £ in 2019). According to speculation, the sale was motivated by financial issues and a personal distaste of the building. It remained empty until 1882 when it was purchased by Thomas Nevill, a local industrialist whose wealth came from <a href="Calico%20%28textile%29">calico</a> printing, for his son, Charles. While living in the house, Charles Nevill carried out substantial restoration and remodelling, making the interior more comfortable while retaining most of the building's external features. The landscape of the grounds was redesigned, and a new stable was built along with a west and east lodge, housing the coachman and head gardener respectively. Another building, known as Hall Cottage, was also built in the vicinity, and housed the Sidebottom family.

Thomas Nevill, Charles' nephew and adopted son, inherited the estate in 1916, but decided to sell it following financial difficulties after the First World War. In 1923, many items of furniture were auctioned off, but there was no interest in purchase of the house. During that decade rumours arose that Bramall would be dismantled and transported to the United States; this may have been popularised by the autobiography of <a href="Kate%20Douglas%20Wiggin">Kate Douglas Wiggin</a> which described the author's visit to Bramall in 1890. In 1925, the house was auctioned, with the condition that if no purchaser came forward it would be demolished and the materials sold off. At one point the neighbouring local authority, Stockport County Borough Council, offered to buy the estate, but Nevill rejected their offer as "unacceptable". The auction received no acceptable offers. However, one of those present, <a href="John%20Henry%20Davies">John Henry Davies</a>, president of <a href="Manchester%20United">Manchester United</a>, later offered £15,000 (about £ in 2019) for the house; this was accepted. He lived in the house until his death in 1927, and his widow Amy remained there until 1935, when she sold it to <a href="Hazel%20Grove%20and%20Bramhall">Hazel Grove and Bramhall Urban District Council</a> for £14,360 (worth about £ in 2019) with the intention that the house and park be open to the public.

Under council ownership, the house was occupied by a caretaker, though most of the building was open to the public. The house and grounds were used for various functions, such as the proclamation of <a href="George%20VI%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George VI</a> succeeding his brother <a href="King%20Edward%20VIII">King Edward VIII</a> to the throne. At that time, the house was sparsely furnished as the Council was unable to afford much furniture. One of the Council's earliest projects was the restoration of the Chapel, which had fallen out of use towards the end of the 19th century. It was restored to resemble how it would have been when the Davenports were last at Bramall, and a service of consecration was held on 30 October 1938 once the work had been completed. In 1947, an association called the Friends of Bramall Hall was set up, primarily to find furnishings for the house, but also to advertise and assist in the upkeep of the house and grounds. Over the years, many furnishings which had once belonged to the house were returned, including portraits of the occupants. The estate is now the property of <a href="Stockport%20Metropolitan%20Borough%20Council">Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council</a> (SMBC), which acquired it in 1974, following local government reorganisation.

The house and grounds are open to the public and are run by SMBC. Visitors may take an official tour of the house or explore it at their own pace on a self-guided basis. The public is able to wander the grounds freely at all times. Events and club meetings are held in the house and grounds throughout the year, and local schools often visit to experience life in a particular era. The house is licensed for wedding and civil partnership ceremonies, and has been used as a background for television series and films, including "<a href="Prank%20Patrol%20%28British%20TV%20series%29">Prank Patrol</a>", "<a href="Cash%20in%20the%20Attic">Cash in the Attic</a>", "<a href="Coronation%20Street">Coronation Street</a>", "<a href="The%20Making%20of%20a%20Lady">The Making of a Lady</a>" and "<a href="The%20Last%20Vampyre">The Last Vampyre</a>".

Although the house and the park are currently officially known by the name "Bramall", both have been spelled as "Bramhall", "Bramal" and other variations over the years. The "Domesday Book" used the spelling "Bramale", which led Charles Nevill to prefer "Bramall", a convention maintained by Hazel Grove and Bramhall Urban District Council when it acquired the property and continued by Stockport Council. Generally, the hall is now referred to as "Bramall Hall", whilst the name of the park, village and manor are spelt "Bramhall", though there remain some local inconsistencies. 

There has been a settlement at Bramhall since Saxon times. According to Alfred Burton, who wrote about Bramhall in the late 19th century, the house has not always been in the present location, and was originally at Crow Holt Wood. This theory was rejected by another historian, Frederick Moorhouse, who became convinced in 1909 that Crow Holt Wood was a place where animals would have been taken to be sorted. There is no conclusive evidence to support either theory. Today the house is situated at the top of two valleys to its south and east sides, which two streams run through. It is a grade I <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a>, and the oldest parts date from the late 14th century, with later renovations dating from the 16th and 19th centuries. It was originally accessed from the east side – the drive followed the route of the Ladybrook stream, then uphill towards the Chapel on the south side, reaching the courtyard on the other side. The main entrance is now on the side of the courtyard, in the west, because of the restructuring of the drive in 1888. The current layout of the house can clearly be seen from the west side of the building, in the courtyard: the service wing is on the left, the Great Hall is in the centre, and the Banqueting Hall is on the right. Before the 19th century, the courtyard was enclosed by a gatehouse which was taken down between 1774 and 1819, because of its being neither required nor in vogue.
The house is built with stone foundations, and the main structure is made of <a href="oak">oak</a> timbers, joined together using <a href="mortice%20and%20tenon">mortice and tenon</a> <a href="Woodworking%20joints">joints</a>, and held in place with oak pegs. <a href="Wattle%20and%20daub">Wattle and daub</a> or <a href="lath">lath</a> and <a href="plaster">plaster</a> are used to fill the spaces between the timbers. The black and white appearance from the <a href="timber%20framing">timber framing</a> construction dates from the Tudor period, though some parts have been repaired in later years.

The Great Hall is the central part of Bramall Hall. As with typical <a href="great%20hall">great hall</a>s in the Middle Ages, this would have been the room where the business of the house, estate and its villagers was conducted as well as a communal eating room for the household. It was originally an open-roofed, single-storey building, with a fireplace situated in the middle of the floor. It was probably first built around the end of the 14th century when the Davenports became lords of the manor. Towards the end of the 16th century, the Great Hall was substantially rebuilt, and the Withdrawing Room was created above it. A <a href="long%20gallery">long gallery</a> was also added as a third storey. The history of the gallery is uncertain; it was intact in 1790 but was taken down before 1819, because it was believed to be unsafe. A similar gallery was built at <a href="Little%20Moreton%20Hall">Little Moreton Hall</a>, and it is still intact, causing the lower storeys to buckle under the weight. The Great Hall has a <a href="bay%20window">bay window</a> with leaded windows, common throughout the building. <a href="William%20Harrison%20Ainsworth">William Harrison Ainsworth</a> wrote about a right of way through the Great Hall, in his 1834 novel "<a href="Rookwood%20%28novel%29">Rookwood</a>". He described how a traveller could pass through the Great Hall, and be entertained and sometimes refreshed. He described Bramall as "[the] best specimen of its class ... its class, in our opinion, is the best ... to be met with in Cheshire". No evidence exists for any such right of way. According to another tale, food from the buttery hatch was given to the poor who congregated outside.
The Lesser Hall leads off the southern end of the Great Hall. Its walls are panelled with oak, and the timbers that the ceiling is constructed of are decorated with cross and rose shapes dating from the Victorian era. The Banqueting Hall, which leads off the Lesser Hall to the west, is believed by Dean to be the oldest part of the house. Its northern wall is possibly the oldest part of the house, not having been renovated like the rest of the courtyard walls. The Nevills used this room as a <a href="billiards%20room">billiards room</a>. The Chapel, opposite the Banqueting Hall, was the only place of public worship in Bramhall until the 19th century. Its existence was first recorded in 1541, when it was referred to in the will of the second William Davenport. It fell into disrepair after its closure between 1869 and 1890, and was restored by Hazel Grove and Bramhall Urban District Council, following its purchase of the property in 1935, and religious services began to be held there again. On the north wall are unglazed windows which face the wall of the Library, showing that the south wing was once separate from the Great Hall. The <a href="Ten%20Commandments">Ten Commandments</a> are written on the west wall. Underneath the Commandments, an older, pre-<a href="English%20Reformation">Reformation</a> <a href="Passion%20%28Christianity%29">Passion</a> painting, is visible. Such depictions were banned during the Reformation, and whitewashed over. It was not until the 20th century that efforts were made to restore Passion paintings, but very little of this particular painting survives.

The <a href="Ballroom">Ballroom</a>, also known as the Upper Banqueting Hall, has an arched roof and according to Dean likely dates from the 16th century. It contains rare 16th-century wall murals, including one which according to Dean may depict the nursery rhyme "<a href="Ride%20a%20cock%20horse%20to%20Banbury%20Cross">Ride a cock horse</a>", and another along the east wall depicting a man playing a <a href="mandolin">mandolin</a>. Above the Chapel is the Chapel Room, also known as the Queen Anne Room, the Priest's Room, and Nevill's Room. It had been two rooms, a state bedroom and <a href="Antechamber">ante-room</a>, but was almost totally transformed in the late 19th century into one larger room. A blocked-up door next to the fireplace was thought to have been a <a href="priest%20hole">priest hole</a>, but is more likely to have been the entrance to the first floor of the house from an external staircase before the wing was restructured, probably in the late 16th century or the early 17th century.

North of the Chapel Room is the Paradise Room, whose name derives from the bed hangings which include embroidered images of <a href="Adam%20and%20Eve">Adam and Eve</a> and their fall from paradise, as well as the use in Tudor times of the name "paradise" for a favourite room, often a bedchamber. This room has panelled walls, and a fireplace with a cupboard on the right hand side. On the other side there is a small recess, which was described in an 1882 newspaper as "a dark passage which is said to lead to some region unknown". It is possible that this was a priest's hide, adjacent to the Chapel and Chapel Room. Less romantically, it may, alternatively, have been a garderobe or privy. This room became associated with sightings of ghosts in the 19th century, and legends of a secret passage that led from the room outside or to the Chapel arose, though no such passages exist.
The largest room on the first floor is the Withdrawing Room, situated above the Great Hall. It has an elaborate plaster ceiling, and the overmantel above the fireplace bears the arms of <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20I">Queen Elizabeth I</a>. The frieze of the Withdrawing Room incorporates shields of arms representing marriages of the Davenports.

The northern wing of Bramall came to be the service wing with the kitchen, scullery, butler's pantry, dairy and store rooms on the ground floor and the servants' bedrooms in the attic.

The house is set in around of parkland, only a part of the estate originally attached to the house, which was, at one time, about in extent. The park was used for hunting, and the grounds were home to cattle, deer and horses, until the 17th century, when it was used as agricultural land. Two water courses run through the park: the <a href="Micker%20Brook">Ladybrook</a>, which, a little beyond the Park, becomes the Micker Brook, before flowing into the River Mersey, and a stream known as the Carr Brook. In the 1880s, Charles Nevill remodelled the grounds in the Romantic Victorian taste, altering the course of the Ladybrook, adding considerably to the trees in the park and creating artificial ponds The ponds were stocked with <a href="trout">trout</a> (though they are no longer fished). In 1888, a new drive was made through the park, a few yards further to the south of the house than the previous drive, and below the East Front of the house Nevill set out terraces.

The park is open to the public and features woodland, open grass areas, gardens, a café, a bowling green, and children's play areas.

Nuckelavee

The nuckelavee () or nuckalavee is a horse-like demon from <a href="Orkney">Orcadian</a> mythology that combines <a href="Equus%20%28genus%29">equine</a> and human elements. It has its origins in <a href="Norse%20mythology">Norse mythology</a>, and is the most horrible of all the demons of Scotland's <a href="Northern%20Isles">Northern Isles</a>. The "nuck" component of its name may be cognate with "Nick" in Old Nick, a name for the Christian <a href="Devil">Devil</a>. The nuckelavee's breath was thought to wilt crops and sicken livestock, and the creature was held responsible for droughts and epidemics on land despite being predominantly a sea-dweller.

A graphic description of the nuckelavee as it appears on land was given by an islander who claimed to have had a confrontation with it, but accounts describing the details of the creature's appearance are inconsistent. In common with many other sea monsters it is unable to tolerate fresh water, therefore those it is pursuing have only to cross a river or stream to be rid of it. The nuckelavee is kept in confinement during the summer months by the <a href="Sea%20Mither">Mither o' the Sea</a>, an ancient Orcadian spirit, and the only one able to control it.

Orcadian folklore had a strong Scandinavian influence, and it may be that the nuckelavee is a composite of a <a href="water%20horse">water horse</a> from <a href="Celtic%20mythology">Celtic mythology</a> and a creature imported by the <a href="Norsemen">Norsemen</a>. As with similar malevolent entities such as the <a href="kelpie">kelpie</a>, it possibly offered an explanation for incidents that islanders in ancient times could not otherwise understand.

The late 19th century saw an upsurge of interest in transcribing folklore, but the recorders used inconsistent spelling and frequently <a href="Anglicisation">anglicised</a> words, thus the same entity could be given different names. The term "nuckelavee" derives from <a href="Orcadian%20dialect">Orcadian</a> "knoggelvi", and according to Orkney resident and 19th-century <a href="folklorist">folklorist</a> <a href="Walter%20Traill%20Dennison">Walter Traill Dennison</a> means "Devil of the Sea". The same demon is called a "mukkelevi" in <a href="Shetland">Shetland</a>, where it was considered a nasty sea <a href="trow%20%28folklore%29">trow</a> or sea devil. <a href="Samuel%20Hibbert-Ware">Samuel Hibbert</a>, an antiquarian of the early nineteenth century, considered the component "nuck" of the nuckelavee's name to be cognate with both the "Nick" in Old Nick, a name sometimes given to the <a href="Devil">Devil</a> of Christian belief, and with the Latin "necare", to kill.

Stories of mythical Orcadian demons are recorded in the 16th-century Latin manuscripts of Jo Ben, who may have been referring to the nuckelavee in his description of the Orkney island of <a href="Stronsay">Stronsay</a>. Dennison transcribed much of the information available about traditional tales told on Orkney, but to an extent romanticised and systematically altered certain elements of the stories in the process of transforming them into prose.

The nuckelavee is a mythical sea creature that appears as a horse-like demon when it ventures onto land. Writer and folklorist <a href="Ernest%20Marwick">Ernest Marwick</a> considered it very similar to the Norwegian <a href="neck%20%28water%20spirit%29">nøkk</a>, the nuggle of the Shetlands and the <a href="kelpie">kelpie</a>. A unique and solitary creature possessing extensive evil powers, its malevolent behaviour can influence events throughout the islands. Islanders were terrified of the creature and would not speak its name without immediately saying a prayer. It was often found in the vicinity of a beach, but would never come ashore if it was raining.

No tales describe what form the nuckelavee takes when in the sea, but its appearance on land has been recounted in graphic detail. An islander, Tammas, claimed to have survived a confrontation with the beast and, after much cajoling from Dennison, reluctantly gave his description of the monster, the only known first-hand account. According to Tammas, the nuckelavee has a man's torso attached to a horse's back as if it were a rider. The male torso has no legs, but its arms can reach the ground from its position on top of the equine body, the legs of which have <a href="fin">fin</a> like appendages. The torso has a large head – possibly as much as in diameter – that rolls back and forth. The monster described by Tammas has two heads; the equine head has an enormous gaping mouth that exudes a smelly toxic vapour, and a single giant eye like a burning red flame. A particularly gruesome detail is that the nuckelavee has no skin; black blood courses through yellow veins, and the pale sinews and powerful muscles are visible as a pulsating mass. Other reports state that the creature resembles a <a href="centaur">centaur</a>; narratives are inconsistent in the finer details of the demon's description however. Traill Dennison only describes a man's head with a "mouth projected like that of a pig". Marwick also only mentions one head with a single red eye, and he borrows some of Tammas's characterisation by recording the creature's mouth as "like a whale's".

The nuckelavee's breath was thought to wilt crops and sicken livestock, and it was considered responsible for epidemics and drought. Seaweed burning to create what was known at the time as "kelp" began on Stronsay in 1722. The product – <a href="Sodium%20carbonate">soda ash</a> – was an alkali mainly used to treat <a href="Soil%20pH%23Acid%20affected%20soils">acidic soil</a>, although as time went on its commercial importance in soap and glass manufacture increased. The pungent smoke emitted during the process was believed to enrage the nuckelavee, resulting in a wild rampage of <a href="pandemic">plague</a>, the deaths of cattle and the destruction of crops. The nuckelavee was said to have infected horses on Stronsay with the deadly disease known as mortasheen, to demonstrate its fury and exact its revenge against the islanders for burning seaweed; the infection subsequently spread to all the other islands involved in the industry. The creature was also blamed for prolonged periods of abnormally low rainfall, leading to water shortages and poor harvests.

The nuckelavee is the most malevolent of the demons in and around the Scottish islands, without any redeeming characteristics. The only entity able to control it is the <a href="Sea%20Mither">Mither o' the Sea</a>, an ancient spirit in Orcadian mythology who keeps the nuckelavee confined during the summer months. In common with other mythical sea monsters, with the possible exception of kelpies and the <a href="nuggle">nuggle</a> of Shetland, it is unable to wade through fresh flowing water, therefore it can be escaped by crossing a stream. Tammas managed to escape from the nuckelavee after he inadvertently splashed it with water from the <a href="loch">loch</a> he was alongside; this briefly distracted the monster, allowing Tammas to run over to a nearby channel of fresh water and jump to safety on the opposite bank.

Malevolent creatures possibly served to provide explanations for incidents that islanders were otherwise unable to account for; many ancient myths were based upon the natural elements of the turbulent and ever changing sea around Orkney. Established Orcadian tales were strongly influenced by Scandinavian mythology with a blending of traditional <a href="Celts">Celtic</a> stories, so the nuckelavee may have its roots in a mythical creature imported by the <a href="Norsemen">Norsemen</a> fused with a traditional Celtic <a href="water%20horse">water horse</a>.

Puerto Rican amazon

The Puerto Rican amazon ("Amazona vittata"), also known as the Puerto Rican parrot or iguaca, is the only extant parrot <a href="Endemism%20in%20birds">endemic</a> to the <a href="archipelago">archipelago</a> of <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a>, and belongs to the <a href="Neotropic%20ecozone">Neotropical</a> genus "<a href="amazon%20parrot">Amazona</a>". Measuring , the bird is a predominantly green <a href="parrot">parrot</a> with a red forehead and white rings around the eyes. Two subspecies have been described, although there are doubts regarding the distinctiveness of the form "gracilipes" from <a href="Culebra%2C%20Puerto%20Rico">Culebra Island</a>, extinct since 1912. Its closest relatives are believed to be the <a href="Cuban%20amazon">Cuban amazon</a> and the <a href="Hispaniolan%20amazon">Hispaniolan amazon</a>.

The Puerto Rican amazon reaches sexual maturity at between three and four years of age. It reproduces once a year and is a <a href="cavity%20nester">cavity nester</a>. Once the female lays eggs she will remain in the nest and continuously incubate them until hatching. The chicks are fed by both parents and will <a href="fledge">fledge</a> 60 to 65 days after hatching. This parrot's diet is varied and consists of flowers, fruits, leaves, bark and nectar obtained from the forest <a href="Canopy%20%28forest%29">canopy</a>.

The species is the only remaining native parrot in Puerto Rico and has been listed as <a href="critically%20endangered">critically endangered</a> by the <a href="World%20Conservation%20Union">World Conservation Union</a> since 1994. Once widespread and abundant, the population declined drastically in the 19th and early 20th centuries with the removal of most of its native habitat; the species completely vanished from <a href="Vieques%2C%20Puerto%20Rico">Vieques</a> and <a href="Mona%2C%20Puerto%20Rico">Mona Island</a>, nearby to the main island of Puerto Rico. Conservation efforts commenced in 1968 to save the bird from extinction. In 2012, the total estimated population was 58–80 individuals in the wild and over 300 individuals in captivity.

The Puerto Rican amazon was described by Dutch ornithologist <a href="Pieter%20Boddaert">Pieter Boddaert</a> in 1783. It belongs to the large <a href="Neotropic%20ecozone">Neotropical</a> genus "Amazona", commonly known as <a href="amazon%20parrot">amazons</a>; these birds have also been given the generic epithet of "parrot" by the <a href="American%20Ornithologists%27%20Union">American Ornithologists' Union</a>, hence "Puerto Rican parrot" is an alternative common name in North America. The indigenous <a href="Ta%C3%ADno%20people">Taíno</a> people called it the "iguaca", an <a href="onomatopoeic">onomatopoeic</a> name that resembled the parrots' flight call.

There are two recognized subspecies:

There is no evidence that the West Indies were connected to a continent in the past, and thus the various native bird species are assumed to be descended from those that immigrated to the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> at some point. Some small species would have encountered problems traversing large bodies of water, but parrots have flight strength and various behavioral characteristics that would facilitate "over-water" dispersion. Most Caribbean bird species originate from <a href="Central%20America">Central</a>, <a href="North%20America">North</a> and <a href="South%20America">South America</a>. The "<a href="amazon%20parrot">Amazona</a>" species found in the Caribbean are divided in two groups: five mid-sized species found in the <a href="Greater%20Antilles">Greater Antilles</a> and seven large species in the <a href="Lesser%20Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a>. All the Greater Antillean amazons display characteristics leading to suppositions of relatedness, including predominantly green-toned color patterns and white rings around the eyes. Russello and Amato conclude that all Greater Antillean "Amazona" descend from "<a href="Amazona%20albifrons">Amazona albifrons</a>" with "Amazona vittata", "<a href="Amazona%20leucocephala">Amazona leucocephala</a>", and "<a href="Amazona%20ventralis">Amazona ventralis</a>" constituting a complex, a cluster of species so closely related that they <a href="Intergradation">intergrade</a>.

British ornithologist <a href="David%20Lack">David Lack</a> considered that the Puerto Rican amazon had evolved from the Hispaniolan amazon ("A. ventralis") found in <a href="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a>, but it has since been argued that he omitted some elements in his analysis, including the similarities found between the <a href="black-billed%20amazon">black-billed amazon</a> ("A. agilis") of <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> and the Puerto Rican amazon. Subsequent studies showed that size and color patterns were not sufficient to assess evolutionary relationships, and that patterns changed with relative ease even within members of the same species. The research concluded that the Puerto Rican amazon may share a common ancestor with the Jamaican "A. agilis". Recent <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> studies show that the Puerto Rican amazon is more closely related to the Hispaniolan amazon and the Cuban amazon than to the black-billed amazon.

The Puerto Rican amazon measures and weighs , or on average. Although small compared to amazons in general, it is similar in size to other Greater Antilles "Amazona" species. <a href="Sexual%20dimorphism">Sexual dimorphism</a> is not present. Both males and females have predominantly green plumage, though their feathers have blue edges. The <a href="Primary%20feathers">primary flight feathers</a> of the wings and the main <a href="Covert%20%28feather%29">covert</a> feathers are dark blue. The color of the feathers on the underside varies depending on the body part: the feathers on the underside of the wings, which can be seen during flight, are bright blue; those in the tail have yellow-green tone. Their underparts are paler and yellow-tinged, their foreheads are red, and they have white ovals around the eyes. The iris is brown, the bill a horn color, and the legs yellow-tan. Aside from DNA tests, males and females can only be distinguished by behavioral differences during the breeding season. Immature birds have plumage similar to adults.
The precise distribution of the Puerto Rican amazon before the arrival of <a href="Spain">Spanish</a> colonialists is uncertain, because of a lack of contemporary records and then the extermination of the indigenous <a href="Ta%C3%ADno%20people">Taíno</a> people, but the species was apparently widespread and abundant. There is also evidence the species may have inhabited other nearby islands, such as <a href="Antigua">Antigua</a>, <a href="Barbuda">Barbuda</a> and the <a href="Virgin%20Islands">Virgin Islands</a>. Estimates of the parrot's early numbers vary greatly. Some authorities claim that there were once more than a million individuals, while others suggest a more modest population of 100,000. During the first 150 years of Spanish rule the human population was small, and in 1650, when the population of the island was 880 people, the species was still abundant throughout the archipelago. After 1650, human habitation increased exponentially, and by the 18th century the Puerto Rican amazon population started to be affected. Heinrich Moritz Gaede, a German naturalist, declared that by 1836 the parrot population had noticeably declined. Even so, as late as 1864, British ornithologist Edward Cavendish Taylor noted that the parrots were still common near the island's capital, <a href="San%20Juan%2C%20Puerto%20Rico">San Juan</a>.

At first, human activity had not posed a significant threat to the Puerto Rican amazon. The Taíno hunted the parrot but without much effect on its population. In the past 200 years, however, many factors have led to a drastic decrease in the birds' numbers: agricultural development, the construction of roads, hydroelectric development, and the adoption of young chicks as pets. Especially during the latter half of the 19th century, most of Puerto Rico's virgin forests, a historical habitat of the species, were cleared for agricultural development, primarily for the production of sugar, cotton, corn and rice. The amazon quickly came to rely on these crops as its main food source and so became seen as a pest; local farmers repelled or hunted the bird if possible. As agriculture expanded, the amazon's habitat disappeared further and its population declined.

The species was historically found in mature or old-growth forests in Puerto Rico at all elevations, and in holes, cliffs, and other diverse habitats at lower elevations. The species could be found at medium elevations in the <a href="Guajataca%20State%20Forest">Guajataca State Forest</a> (until 1910) and the <a href="Rio%20Abajo%20State%20Forest">Rio Abajo State Forest</a> (until the 1920s), and at high elevations in the <a href="Carite%20State%20Forest">Carite State Forest</a> (until the 1930s). Accounts from the early 1900s describe the parrots traveling away from the <a href="Luquillo">Luquillo</a> forest and the <a href="Sierra%20de%20Cayey">Sierra de Cayey</a> towards the main island's coast to find food. At the same time, the species was extirpated from Puerto Rico's smaller islands—Culebra, Vieques and Mona—and became restricted to five locations: two in <a href="Karst%20topography">karst-limestone areas</a>, two in high <a href="Puerto%20Rican%20moist%20forests%23Montane%20forests">montane rainforests</a> and one in <a href="Mangrove">mangrove forest</a> at the foot of the <a href="El%20Yunque%20National%20Forest">El Yunque National Forest</a>. One of these karst regions, located in the northwestern part of Puerto Rico, was identified as a haven for the species. In particular, a region named "Valle de las Cotorras" (Valley of the Parrots), located between <a href="San%20Sebasti%C3%A1n%2C%20Puerto%20Rico">San Sebastián</a> and <a href="Morovis%2C%20Puerto%20Rico">Morovis</a>, was home to a sizable population. Some amazons survived in small pockets of degraded forest but these proved insufficient to support large colonies. Eventually their natural habitat was reduced to the <a href="Cordillera%20Central%20%28Puerto%20Rico%29">Cordillera Central</a> and undisturbed forest areas, and by 1940 they were only to be found in primary forest at the Luquillo Mountains in El Yunque National Forest. The species is currently found at elevations between . Since the species requires mature forests with open-cavity trees for reproduction, it does not occur in <a href="Elfin%20forest">dwarf</a> and <a href="secondary%20forest">secondary forest</a>s.

By the 1950s, there were only 200 parrots in the wild, and in 1975 the population reached an absolute low of 13 individuals. Numbers then recovered, and in August 1989 there were an estimated minimum of 47 individuals. But on September 18, 1989, <a href="Hurricane%20Hugo">Hurricane Hugo</a> struck the northeast coast of Puerto Rico inflicting heavy casualties on the remaining birds. In the aftermath of the hurricane the population was estimated at 23 individuals. In 2004, the wild population was 30–35 individuals, and the long-term trend appears to be stable albeit with some fluctuations. The current range of the species is , 0.2% of what it once was.

The Puerto Rican amazon is diurnal, typically beginning its day half an hour after sunrise. It is generally secretive when inside its nest, using its green plumage as camouflage. In contrast, it may be vocal and noisy when outside the nest. Upon taking flight, its color pattern provides some contrast to the forest. The flight mechanism of this species is similar to the one found in other amazons, and involves strokes below the body axis, unlike most birds whose wings flow above their bodies in flight. Amazons can fly moderately fast, reaching a top speed of approximately , and are fairly agile when evading predators in mid-air. When in search of food, the parrots group in pairs. Couples and their <a href="fledge">fledge</a>d young display a tendency to stay together. The amazon makes two flight calls, a take-off squawk which consist of a pattern of long squawks, and a loud "bugle", commonly used in flight and which may have several meanings depending on the circumstances when it is used.

Like almost all amazons, the Puerto Rican amazon is a <a href="herbivore">herbivore</a>. Its diet consists of flowers, fruits, leaves, bark and nectar obtained from the forest's <a href="Canopy%20%28forest%29">canopy</a>. The species has been recorded to consume more than 60 different materials, although its diet was historically more varied due to its larger <a href="Range%20%28biology%29">range</a>. Among the items it consumes are the <a href="Exocarp">pericarp</a> of the seeds of sierra palm ("Prestoea montana"), tabonuco ("<a href="Dacryodes%20excelsa">Dacryodes excelsa</a>"), and negra lora ("Matayba domingensis"); the fruits of "bejuco de rana" ("Marcgravia sintenisii"), camasey ("Miconia sintenisii"), cupey de altura ("Clusia gundlachii"), and "palo de cruz" ("Rheedia portoricensis"); the flowers of bejuco de rana, achiotillo ("Alchornea latifolia"), and "Piptocarpha tetrantha"; the leaves and twigs of cupeillo ("Clusia grisebachiana"), laurel sabino ("<a href="Magnolia%20splendens">Magnolia splendens</a>"), caimitillo verde ("Micropholis garciniaefolia"), and "Piptocarpha tetrantha"; the bark of bejuco de rana, cupeillo, and cachimbo cumun ("Psychotria berteriana"); and the <a href="bud">bud</a>s of cuaba ("<a href="Inga%20vera">Inga vera</a>"). It normally selects the fruits positioned directly in front of its eyes, picking them one at a time with some rare exceptions. When feeding, it uses a foot to pick up the food. The amazon feeds in a slow, paused manner taking 8–60 seconds to consume separate items.

The Puerto Rican amazon usually mates for life, with pairs only changing mates if one bird perishes or abandons the nest. A male may abandon the female if the latter is injured, re-mating with a more "physically perfect" subject. The pairing process is unknown; however, new pairs tend to participate in mutual mating dances characterised by coordinated bows, partial extension of the wings and full tail expansion.

The Puerto Rican amazon is a secondary <a href="cavity%20nester">cavity nester</a>, nesting in tree trunk cavities, both naturally occurring and excavated by other species. It prefers to nest in "Palo colorado" trees ("<a href="Cyrilla%20racemiflora">Cyrilla racemiflora</a>"), but uses other trees, including the laurel sabino ("Magnolia splendens") and tabonuco ("Dacryodes excelsa"), to a lesser extent. These trees are mature cavity-forming trees which provide protection against predators and the entry of water. Recently, the species has also nested in artificial wooden boxes designed as part of the recovery plan for the species. Nest height varies from above ground. The male usually leads the search for nest sites, although the final decision seems to be taken by the female. Once a site is selected, the pair will spend some time inspecting and cleaning it. No lining material is added to the <a href="Bird%20nest">nest</a>.
The Puerto Rican amazon reaches <a href="sexual%20maturity">sexual maturity</a> at 4 years of age in the wild and at 3 years in captivity. The species usually reproduces once a year between the months of January and July (the <a href="dry%20season">dry season</a>). Copulation between pairs seems to be closely related to food transfers, with this possibly serving as a trigger for intercourse. Amazons have a copulation pattern similar to that found in other parrots throughout the Americas, with the male gripping a perch with one leg while passively placing the other in the female's back. As the time for egg-laying approaches the pair spends more time in the nest, with the male providing food to the female via regurgitation. The female lays 2–4 eggs that she exclusively incubates for a period of 24 to 28 days, while the male will be present in the vicinity of the nest when providing food. Females only leave the nest on rare occasions involving repelling predators or if the male has not brought food in an extended time frame. The chicks are fed by both parents until they leave the nest, usually 60 to 65 days after they hatch. Nonetheless, they remain dependent on their parents and travel with them until the next breeding season.

Like other amazons, the Puerto Rican amazon is gregarious while performing daily activities, but territorial around its nest. The size of the territory around the nest is usually around . Pairs are extremely cautious near their nest, usually moving in a slow manner when leaving the nest to avoid the attention of predators. Although territorial defense is mostly composed of loud vocalizations there are instances of actual physical combat. Pairs will defend their nest sites against invading couples, sometimes focusing on the location's defense instead of egg-laying. Pairs nesting in areas uninhabited by other parrots will remain mostly silent unless other parrots enter the zone. Some pairs may display moderate territoriality even when not apparently intending to nest, with these tendencies beginning in the latter half of the breeding season. One hypothesis is that this would occur in young pairs that had still not reached full maturity, serving as "practice territoriality".

On March 11, 1967, the Puerto Rican amazon entered the <a href="United%20States%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service%20list%20of%20endangered%20species">United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species</a>. At the time of inclusion the population was estimated at 70 individuals. In 1968, recovery efforts began to increase the population in the wild. In 1972, when the estimated population was 16 individuals, the <a href="United%20States%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">United States Fish and Wildlife Service</a> (USFWS) at the Luquillo Aviary began efforts to breed parrots in captivity and yielded good results. In June 2006, it was reported by the USFWS that its birds in captivity had successfully hatched 39 chicks (the yearly average is around 16). In 2006, 22 birds were released in the Rio Abajo State Forest to initiate a second wild population, and a further 19 were released at the same site on 27 December 2008.

The <a href="World%20Conservation%20Union">World Conservation Union</a> (IUCN) lists the Puerto Rican amazon as a <a href="critically%20endangered%20species">critically endangered species</a> since 1994. The species is regulated under Appendix I of the <a href="Convention%20on%20International%20Trade%20in%20Endangered%20Species%20of%20Wild%20Fauna%20and%20Flora">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora</a> (CITES), rendering illegal international trade in specimens or parts.

Human activity is arguably the main reason for the population decline of the Puerto Rican amazon. Early settlers of Puerto Rico, such as the Taíno, hunted it for food consumption but managed to maintain a healthy ecological balance. Later, habitat destruction, capture of immature individuals for the pet industry, hunting and predation contributed to the sharp population decline. The clearing of mature forests for agricultural development is the main reason for the decline of population.

Natural predators of the Puerto Rican amazon include the <a href="red-tailed%20hawk">red-tailed hawk</a> ("Buteo jamaicensis"), the <a href="broad-winged%20hawk">broad-winged hawk</a> ("Buteo platypterus"), the <a href="peregrine%20falcon">peregrine falcon</a> ("Falco peregrinus") and the <a href="pearly-eyed%20thrasher">pearly-eyed thrasher</a> ("Margarops fuscatus"). The thrasher invaded Puerto Rico in the mid-20th century and has been a problem for the parrot population since 1973; to combat this, specially designed deep nests were prepared for the parrots in subsequent years to prevent competition from the invaders. Introduced <a href="Western%20honeybee">honeybees</a> ("Apis mellifera"), the related Hispaniolan amazon ("Amazona ventralis"), <a href="black%20rat">black rat</a>s ("Rattus rattus") and <a href="small%20Asian%20mongoose">Indian mongooses</a> ("Herpestes javanicus") may compete for nesting cavities, and the latter two may eat eggs and chicks.

Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, were not a threat to the Puerto Rican parrot population when it was more readily self-maintaining, but as a result of the fragmentation and reduction of the population these disasters are now a threat as well. <a href="Hurricane%20Hugo">Hurricane Hugo</a> passed through the species' range in September 1989, and reduced the population from 47 to 23 individuals.

In response to the Puerto Rican amazon's low population and endangered status, a recovery plan was drafted and implemented in 1968. Its main objective was to downlist the species to threatened status by the year 2020. Other objectives included establishing two separate viable wild populations (each of which would consist of 500 or more individuals for a period of at least five years), protecting habitat for those populations, and controlling predators, parasites and competitors. A third site was planned in 2011 by the <a href="Caribbean%20Islands%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge%20Complex">Caribbean Islands National Wildlife Refuge Complex</a>. As part of the conservation efforts, a captive population was established in the Luquillo Aviary in 1973. Another was established in 1993 when some individuals were transferred from the Luquillo Aviary to the Rio Abajo State Forest under the administration of the Puerto Rican Department of Natural Resources ("Departamento de Recursos Naturales y Ambientales"). In 2007, expanded facilities at the Iguaca Aviary at the <a href="El%20Yunque%20National%20Forest">El Yunque National Forest</a> were inaugurated and dedicated to the late Priscilla Stubbe, who was a major fundraiser for the new facility.

Human activity once again threatened the amazon during the following years. In 2012, it was reported that the unsanctioned flight of light aircraft from adjacent islands was disrupting the reproductive and social behaviors of the species. "<a href="V%C3%ADa%20Verde%20project">Via Verde</a>", a gas pipeline grid proposed by the <a href="Luis%20Fortu%C3%B1o">Luis Fortuño</a> administration, raised concerns among conservationists due to further deforestation of the regions where the birds feed. New conservation efforts have also begun during this timeframe. In 2011, a research team of the <a href="University%20of%20Puerto%20Rico%20at%20Mayag%C3%BCez">University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez</a> sequenced the amazon's genome. On August 15, 2013, the discovery of non-assisted nests in the Río Abajo State Forest was announced. Experts considered this a sign of expansion, implying that the reintroduced amazon population was fully adapting to wild life and was dispersing throughout the region. This was noted as a significant advance, since El Yunque is not an ideal habitat for the bird due to its humidity, which precipitates sickness in some of the individuals. This was accompanied by a second announcement, which noted that added to the known number of amazons in the wild (fluctuating between 64 and 112 specimens) there is an unmonitored population of approximately 50 birds dispersed throughout Puerto Rico.

The creation of another aviary and captive reproduction center was considered throughout 2013, with the municipalities of Maricao and Isabela being analyzed. In November 2013, plans for the establishment of a third population in the <a href="Maricao%20State%20Forest">Maricao State Forest</a> were formally announced. The following month, ten amazons were released at Río Abajo. 2013 set a new record for the reproduction program, which produced 51 fledglings and shattered the previous record of 34 that was established in 2011. The wild population grew by 15 chicks, an improvement from the 12 born during the previous year. During this time frame, the known number of amazon specimens rounded 500 individuals. A severe drought caused by the emergence of <a href="El%20Ni%C3%B1o">El Niño</a> began during the spring of 2015 and extended throughout the summer, benefitting the breeding of the amazons in El Yunque by extending their reproductive season. However, this weather pattern also increased the number of mongooses present in the forest, representing a risk for the population. On August 13, 2015, a group of 25 amazons was moved from the other aviaries to a repurposed installation in Maricao. Each member was brought individually in order to ensure their safety while being transported and later placed in an acclimation program that is expected to last a year, before they are released to create a new population in the region.

Columbian mammoth

The Columbian mammoth ("Mammuthus columbi") is an extinct species of <a href="mammoth">mammoth</a> that inhabited North America as far north as the northern United States and as far south as Costa Rica during the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> epoch. It was one of the last in a line of mammoth species, beginning with "<a href="Mammuthus%20subplanifrons">Mammuthus subplanifrons</a>" in the early <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a>. The Columbian mammoth evolved from the <a href="steppe%20mammoth">steppe mammoth</a>, which entered North America from Asia about 1.5 million years ago. The <a href="pygmy%20mammoth">pygmy mammoth</a>s of the <a href="Channel%20Islands%20of%20California">Channel Islands of California</a> evolved from Columbian mammoths. The closest <a href="extant%20taxon">extant</a> relative of the Columbian and other mammoths is the <a href="Asian%20elephant">Asian elephant</a>.

Reaching at the shoulders and in weight, the Columbian mammoth was one of the largest species of mammoth. It had long, curved tusks and four <a href="molars">molars</a>, which were replaced six times during the lifetime of an individual. It most likely used its tusks and trunk like modern elephants—for manipulating objects, fighting, and foraging. Bones, hair, dung and stomach contents have been discovered, but no preserved carcasses are known. The Columbian mammoth preferred open areas, such as <a href="Aspen%20parkland">parkland</a> landscapes, and fed on sedge, grass, and other plants. It did not live in the Arctic regions of Canada, which were instead inhabited by <a href="woolly%20mammoth">woolly mammoth</a>s. The ranges of the two species may have overlapped, and genetic evidence suggests that they interbred. Several sites contain the skeletons of multiple Columbian mammoths, either because they died in incidents such as a <a href="drought">drought</a>, or because these locations were natural traps in which individuals accumulated over time.

For a few thousand years prior to their extinction, Columbian mammoths coexisted in North America with <a href="Paleoamericans">Paleoamericans</a> – the first humans to inhabit the Americas – who hunted them for food, used their bones for making tools, and depicted them in ancient art. Columbian mammoth remains have been found in association with <a href="Clovis%20culture">Clovis culture</a> artifacts; these remains may have stemmed either from hunting or from scavenging. The Columbian mammoth disappeared at the end of the Pleistocene around 11,500 years ago, most likely as a result of habitat loss caused by <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a>, hunting by humans, or a combination of both.

The Columbian mammoth was first <a href="scientifically%20described">scientifically described</a> in 1857 by Scottish naturalist <a href="Hugh%20Falconer">Hugh Falconer</a>, who named the species "<a href="Elephas">Elephas</a> columbi" after <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>. The animal was brought to Falconer's attention in 1846 by <a href="Charles%20Lyell">Charles Lyell</a>, who sent him <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molar</a> fragments found during the 1838 excavation of the <a href="Brunswick%E2%80%93Altamaha%20Canal">Brunswick–Altamaha Canal</a> in <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, in the southeastern United States. At the time, similar fossils from across North America were attributed to <a href="woolly%20mammoths">woolly mammoths</a> (then "Elephas primigenius"). Falconer found that his specimens were distinct, confirming his conclusion by examining their internal structure and studying additional molars from Mexico. Although <a href="William%20Phipps%20Blake">William Phipps Blake</a> and <a href="Richard%20Owen">Richard Owen</a> believed that "E. texianus" was more appropriate for the species, Falconer rejected the name; he also suggested that "E. imperator" and "E. jacksoni", two other American elephants described from molars, were based on remains too fragmentary to classify properly. More complete material that may be from the same quarry as Falconer's fragmentary <a href="holotype">holotype</a> molar was reported in 2012, and could help shed more light on that specimen, since doubts about its adequacy as a holotype have been raised.

In the early 20th century, the taxonomy of extinct elephants became increasingly complicated. In 1942, <a href="Henry%20Fairfield%20Osborn">Henry Fairfield Osborn</a>'s posthumous monograph on the <a href="Proboscidea">Proboscidea</a> was published, wherein he used various genus and subgenus names that had previously been proposed for extinct elephant species, such as "Archidiskodon", "Metarchidiskodon", "Parelephas", and "Mammonteus". Osborn also retained names for many regional and intermediate subspecies or "varieties", and created recombinations such as "Parelephas columbi felicis" and "Archidiskodon imperator maibeni". The taxonomic situation was simplified by various researchers from the 1970s onwards: all species of <a href="mammoth">mammoth</a> were retained in the genus "Mammuthus", and many proposed differences between species were instead interpreted as <a href="intraspecific">intraspecific</a> variation. In 2003, paleontologist Larry Agenbroad reviewed opinions about North American mammoth taxonomy, and concluded that several species had been declared <a href="junior%20synonyms">junior synonyms</a>, and that "M. columbi" (the Columbian mammoth) and "<a href="M.%20exilis">M. exilis</a>" (the pygmy mammoth) were the only species of mammoth <a href="endemic">endemic</a> to the Americas (as other species lived both there and in Eurasia). The idea that species such as "M. imperator" (the imperial mammoth) and "M. jeffersoni" (<a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Jefferson</a>'s mammoth) were either more primitive or advanced stages in Columbian mammoth evolution was largely dismissed, and they were regarded as synonyms. In spite of these conclusions, Agenbroad cautioned that American mammoth taxonomy is not yet fully resolved.

The earliest known members of Proboscidea, the <a href="clade">clade</a> that contains the elephants, existed about 55 million years ago around the <a href="Tethys%20Sea">Tethys Sea</a> area. The closest living relatives of the Proboscidea are the <a href="sirenia">sirenia</a>ns (dugongs and manatees) and the <a href="hyrax">hyrax</a>es (an order of small, herbivorous mammals). The family <a href="Elephantidae">Elephantidae</a> existed six million years ago in <a href="Africa">Africa</a>, and includes the living elephants and the mammoths. Among many now extinct clades, the <a href="mastodon">mastodon</a> ("Mammut") is only a distant relative, and part of the distinct family <a href="Mammutidae">Mammutidae</a>, which diverged 25 million years before the mammoths evolved. The <a href="Asian%20elephant">Asian elephant</a> ("Elephas maximus") is the closest extant relative of the mammoths. The following <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> shows the placement of the Columbian mammoth among other proboscideans, based on characteristics of the <a href="hyoid%20bone">hyoid bone</a> in the neck:
Since many remains of each species of mammoth are known from several localities, it is possible to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the genus through <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> studies. Mammoth species can be identified from the number of enamel ridges (or <a href="Lamella%20%28anatomy%29">lamellar plates</a>) on their molars: primitive species had few ridges, and the number increased gradually as new species evolved to feed on more abrasive food items. The crowns of the teeth became deeper in height and the skulls became taller to accommodate this. At the same time, the skulls became shorter from front to back to reduce the weight of the head. The short, tall skulls of woolly and Columbian mammoths are the culmination of this process.

The first known members of the genus "Mammuthus" are the African species "<a href="Mammuthus%20subplanifrons">M. subplanifrons</a>" from the <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a>, and "<a href="M.%20africanavus">M. africanavus</a>" from the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>. The former is thought to be the ancestor of later forms. Mammoths entered Europe around 3 million years ago. The earliest European mammoth has been named "<a href="Mammuthus%20rumanus">M. rumanus</a>"; it spread across Europe and China. Only its molars are known, which show that it had 8–10 enamel ridges. A population evolved 12–14 ridges, splitting off from and replacing the earlier type, becoming "<a href="Mammuthus%20meridionalis">M. meridionalis</a>" about 2–1.7 million years ago. In turn, this species was replaced by the <a href="steppe%20mammoth">steppe mammoth</a> ("M. trogontherii") with 18–20 ridges, which evolved in eastern Asia around 2–1.5 million years ago. The Columbian mammoth evolved from a population of "M. trogontherii" that had crossed the <a href="Bering%20Strait">Bering Strait</a> and entered North America about 1.5 million years ago; it retained a similar number of molar ridges. Mammoths derived from "M. trogontherii" evolved molars with 26 ridges 400,000 years ago in Siberia and became the woolly mammoth ("M. primigenius"). Woolly mammoths entered North America about 100,000 years ago.

A population of Columbian mammoths that lived between 80,000 and 13,000 years ago on the <a href="Channel%20Islands%20of%20California">Channel Islands of California</a>, away from the mainland, evolved to be less than half the size of the mainland Columbian mammoths. They are therefore considered to be the distinct species "M. exilis", the <a href="pygmy%20mammoth">pygmy mammoth</a> (or a subspecies, "M. c. exilis"). These mammoths presumably reached the islands by swimming there when <a href="sea%20levels">sea levels</a> were lower, and <a href="island%20dwarfing">decreased in size</a> due to the limited food provided by the islands' small areas. Bones of larger specimens have also been found on the islands, but it is unknown whether these were stages in the dwarfing process, or later arrivals of Columbian mammoths.

A 2011 study of the complete mitochondrial genome (inherited through the female line) showed that two examined Columbian mammoths, including the morphologically typical "Huntington mammoth", were grouped within a subclade of woolly mammoths. This suggests that the two populations interbred and produced fertile offspring. One possible explanation is <a href="introgression">introgression</a> of a <a href="haplogroup">haplogroup</a> from woolly to Columbian mammoths, or vice versa. A similar situation has been documented in modern species of <a href="African%20elephant">African elephant</a> ("Loxodonta"), the <a href="African%20bush%20elephant">African bush elephant</a> ("L. africana") and the <a href="African%20forest%20elephant">African forest elephant</a> ("L. cyclotis"). The authors of the study also suggest that the North American type formerly referred to as "M. jeffersonii" may have been a <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybrid</a> between the two species, as it is apparently morphologically intermediate. These findings were not expected by scientists; <a href="nuclear%20DNA">nuclear DNA</a> and more specimens will have to be examined to clarify the situation.

A 2015 study of mammoth molars confirmed that "M. columbi" evolved from Eurasian "M. trogontherii", not "M. meridionalis" as had been suggested earlier, and noted that "M. columbi" and "M. trogontherii" were so similar in morphology that their classification as separate species may be questionable. The study also suggested that the animals in the range where "M. columbi" and "M. primigenius" overlapped formed a <a href="metapopulation">metapopulation</a> of hybrids with varying morphology. In 2016, a genetic study of North American mammoth specimens confirmed that "M. columbi" and "M. primigenius" interbred extensively, were both descended from "M. trogontherii", and concluded that morphological differences between fossils may therefore not be reliable for determining taxonomy. The authors also questioned whether "M. columbi" and "M. primigenius" should be considered "good species", considering that they were able to interbreed after supposedly being separated for a million years, but cautioned that more specimens need to be sampled.

The Columbian mammoth was about tall at the shoulder and weighed about . It was about the same size as the earlier mammoth species "M. meridionalis" and "M. trogontherii", and was larger than the modern African elephant and the woolly mammoth, both of which reached about . Males were generally larger and more robust. The best indication of sex is the size of the <a href="pelvic">pelvic</a> girdle, since the opening that functions as the birth canal is always wider in females than in males. Like other mammoths, the Columbian mammoth had a high, single-domed head and a sloping back with a high shoulder hump; this shape resulted from the <a href="spinous%20process">spinous process</a>es (protrusions) of the back vertebrae decreasing in length from front to rear. Juveniles, on the other hand, had convex backs like Asian elephants. Other skeletal features include a short, deep <a href="Rostrum%20%28anatomy%29">rostrum</a> (front part of the jaws), a rounded <a href="mandibular%20symphysis">mandibular symphysis</a> (where the two halves of the lower jaw connected) and the <a href="coronoid%20process%20of%20the%20mandible">coronoid process of the mandible</a> (upper protrusion of the jaw bone) extending above the molar surfaces.
Apart from its larger size and more primitive molars, the Columbian mammoth also differed from the woolly mammoth by its more downturned mandibular symphysis; the <a href="dental%20alveoli">dental alveoli</a> (tooth sockets) of the tusks were directed more laterally away from the midline. Its tail was intermediate in length between that of modern elephants and the woolly mammoth. Since no Columbian mammoth soft tissue has been found, much less is known about its appearance than that of the woolly mammoth. It lived in warmer habitats than the woolly mammoth, and probably lacked many of the adaptations seen in that species. Hair thought to be that of the Columbian mammoth has been discovered in <a href="Bechan%20Cave">Bechan Cave</a> in <a href="Utah">Utah</a>, where mammoth dung has also been found. Some of this hair is coarse, and identical to that known to belong to woolly mammoths; however, since this location is so far south it is unlikely to be woolly mammoth hair. The distribution and density of fur on the living animal is unknown, but it was probably less dense than that of the woolly mammoth due to the warmer habitat.

Columbian mammoths had very long tusks (modified <a href="incisor">incisor</a> teeth), which were more curved than those of modern elephants. The largest known mammoth tusk, long, belonged to a Columbian mammoth, and others range from long. Columbian mammoth tusks were usually not much larger than those of woolly mammoths, which reached . The tusks of females were much smaller and thinner. About a quarter of the tusks' length was inside the sockets; they grew spirally in opposite directions from the base, curving until the tips pointed towards each other, and sometimes crossed. Most of their weight would have been close to the skull, with less <a href="torque">torque</a> than straight tusks would have provided. The tusks were usually asymmetrical, with considerable variation; some tusks curved down, instead of outwards, or were shorter due to breakage. Columbian mammoth tusks were generally less twisted than those of woolly mammoths. At six months of age calves developed <a href="Deciduous%20teeth">milk tusks</a> a few centimeters long, which were replaced by permanent tusks a year later. Annual tusk growth of continued throughout life, slowing as the animal reached adulthood.

Columbian mammoths had four functional molar teeth at a time, two in the upper jaw and two in the lower. About of the crown was within the jaw, and was above. The crown was pushed forward and up as it wore down, comparable to a <a href="conveyor%20belt">conveyor belt</a>. The teeth had separated ridges of <a href="Tooth%20enamel">enamel</a>, which were covered in "prisms" directed towards the chewing surface. Wear-resistant, they were held together with <a href="cementum">cementum</a> and <a href="dentin">dentin</a>. A mammoth's molars were replaced five times over the animal's lifetime. The first molars were about the size of those of a human, ; the third were long, and the sixth were about long and weighed . With each replacement, the molars grew larger and gained more ridges; the number of plates varied between individuals. Growing of ridge took about 10.6 years.

Like that of modern elephants, the mammoth's sensitive, muscular trunk was a limb-like organ with many functions. It was used for manipulating objects and social interaction. Although healthy adult mammoths could defend themselves from predators with their tusks, trunks and size, juveniles and weakened adults were vulnerable to pack hunters such as wolves and <a href="big%20cat">big cat</a>s. Bones of juvenile Columbian mammoths, accumulated by "<a href="Homotherium">Homotherium</a>" (the scimitar-toothed cat), have been found in <a href="Friesenhahn%20Cave">Friesenhahn Cave</a> in <a href="Texas">Texas</a>. Tusks may have been used in intra-species fighting for territory or mates and for display, to attract females and intimidate rivals. Two Columbian mammoths that died in Nebraska with tusks interlocked provide evidence of fighting behavior. The mammoths could use their tusks as weapons by thrusting, swiping or crashing them down, and used them in pushing contests by interlocking them, which sometimes resulted in breakage. The tusks' curvature made them unsuitable for stabbing. On <a href="Goat%20Rock%20Beach">Goat Rock Beach</a> in <a href="Sonoma%20Coast%20State%20Park">Sonoma Coast State Park</a>, <a href="blueschist">blueschist</a> and <a href="chert">chert</a> outcrops (nicknamed "Mammoth Rocks") show evidence of having been rubbed by Columbian mammoths or mastodons. The rocks have polished areas above the ground, primarily near their edges, and are similar to African rubbing rocks used by elephants and other herbivores to rid themselves of mud and parasites. Similar rocks exist in <a href="Hueco%20Tanks">Hueco Tanks</a>, Texas, and on <a href="Cornudas%20Mountain">Cornudas Mountain</a> in New Mexico.

Accumulations of modern elephant remains have been called "<a href="elephants%27%20graveyard">elephants' graveyard</a>s", because these sites were erroneously thought to be where old elephants went to die. Similar accumulations of mammoth bones have been found; it is thought these are the result of individuals dying near or in rivers over thousands of years and their bones being accumulated by the water (such as in the <a href="Aucilla%20River">Aucilla River</a> in Florida), or animals dying after becoming mired in mud. Some accumulations are thought to be the remains of herds which died at the same time, perhaps due to flooding. Columbian mammoths are occasionally preserved in <a href="Volcano">volcanic</a> deposits such as those in <a href="Tocuila">Tocuila</a>, <a href="Texcoco%2C%20State%20of%20Mexico">Texcoco</a>, Mexico, where a volcanic <a href="lahar">lahar</a> <a href="mudflow">mudflow</a> covered at least seven individuals 12,500 years ago. It is unknown how many mammoths lived at one location at a time, but it is likely that the number varied by season and life cycle. Modern elephants can form large herds, sometimes consisting of multiple family groups, and these herds can include thousands of animals migrating together. Mammoths may have formed large herds more often than modern elephants, since animals living in open areas are more likely to do this than those in forested areas. Although it is unclear to what extent Columbian mammoths migrated, an <a href="isotope%20analysis">isotope analysis</a> of <a href="Blackwater%20Draw">Blackwater Draw</a> in New Mexico indicated that they spent part of the year in the Rocky Mountains, away. The study of tusk rings may aid further study of mammoth migration.

Like modern elephants, Columbian mammoths were probably social and lived in <a href="Matriarchy">matriarchal</a> (female-led) family groups; most of their other social behavior was also similar to that of modern elephants. This is supported by fossil assemblages such as the <a href="Dent%20Site">Dent Site</a> in <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a> and the <a href="Waco%20Mammoth%20National%20Monument">Waco Mammoth National Monument</a> in <a href="Waco%2C%20Texas">Waco, Texas</a>, where groups consisting entirely of female and juvenile Columbian mammoths have been found (implying female-led family groups). The latter assemblage includes 22 skeletons, with 15 individuals representing a herd of females and juveniles that died in a single event. It was originally proposed that the herd was killed by a <a href="flash%20flood">flash flood</a>, and that the arrangement of some of the skeletons suggests that the females may have formed a defensive ring around the juveniles. In 2016, it was instead suggested that the herd had died by <a href="drought">drought</a> near a diminishing <a href="Depression%20%28geology%29">watering hole</a>; <a href="scavenging">scavenging</a> traces on the bones contradicts rapid burial, and the absence of calves and large diversity of other animal species found gathered at the site support this scenario. Another group, consisting of a bull and six females, is found at the same site; although both groups died between 64,000 and 73,000 years ago, whether they died in the same event is unknown. At the <a href="Murray%20Springs%20Clovis%20Site">Murray Springs Clovis Site</a> in Arizona, where several Columbian mammoth skeletons have been excavated, a <a href="trackway">trackway</a> similar to that left by modern elephants leads to one of the skeletons. The mammoth may have made the trackway before it died, or another individual may have approached the dead or dying animal—similar to the way modern elephants guard dead relatives for several days.

Many specimens also accumulated in natural traps, such as <a href="sinkhole">sinkhole</a>s and <a href="tar%20pit">tar pit</a>s. The <a href="Mammoth%20Site%2C%20Hot%20Springs">Hot Springs Mammoth Site</a> in <a href="South%20Dakota">South Dakota</a> is a 26,000-year-old, approximately -long sinkhole that functioned for 300 to 700 years before filling with <a href="sediment">sediment</a>. The site is the opposite scenario of that in Waco; all but one of the at least 55 skeletons—additional skeletons are excavated each year—are male, and accumulated over time rather than in a single event. It is assumed that like modern male elephants, male mammoths primarily lived alone, were more adventurous (especially young males) and more likely to encounter dangerous situations than the females. The mammoths may have been lured to the hole by warm water or vegetation near the edges, slipping in and drowning or starving. Isotope studies of growth rings have shown that most of the mammoths died during spring and summer, which may have correlated with vegetation near the sinkhole. One individual, nicknamed "Murray", lies on its side, and probably died in this pose while struggling to get free. Deep footprints of mammoths attempting to free themselves from the sinkhole's mud can be seen in vertically-excavated sections of the site.
Since the early 20th century, excavations at the <a href="La%20Brea%20Tar%20Pits">La Brea Tar Pits</a> in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> have yielded 100 tons of fossils from 600 species of flora and fauna, including several Columbian mammoths. Many of the fossils are the remains of animals that became stuck in <a href="asphalt">asphalt</a> puddles which seeped to the surface of the pits, 40,000 to 11,500 years ago. Dust and leaves likely concealed the liquid asphalt, which then trapped unwary animals. Mired animals died from hunger or exhaustion; their corpses attracted predators, which sometimes became stuck themselves. The fossil record of the tar pits is dominated by the remains of predators, such as large <a href="canid">canid</a>s and <a href="felid">felid</a>s. Fossils of different animals are found stuck together when they are excavated from the pits. The tar pits do not preserve soft tissue, and a 2014 study concluded that asphalt may degrade the DNA of animals mired in it after an attempt was made to extract DNA from a Columbian mammoth.

An adult Columbian mammoth would have needed more than of food per day, and may have foraged for twenty hours a day. Mammoths chewed their food by using their powerful jaw muscles to move the mandible forward and close the mouth, then backward while opening; the sharp enamel ridges thereby cut across each other, grinding the food. The ridges were wear-resistant, enabling the animal to chew large quantities of food which contained grit. The trunk could be used for pulling up large tufts of grass, picking buds and flowers or tearing leaves and branches from trees and shrubs, and the tusks were used to dig up plants and strip bark from trees. Digging is indicated on preserved tusks by flat, polished sections of the surface that would have reached the ground. Isotope studies of Columbian mammoths from Mexico and the United States have shown that their diet varied by location, consisting of a mix of <a href="C3%20carbon%20fixation">C3</a> (most plants) and <a href="C4%20carbon%20fixation">C4 plants</a> (such as grasses), and they were not restricted to <a href="grazing">grazing</a> or <a href="browsing">browsing</a>.

Stomach contents from Columbian mammoths are rare, since no carcasses have been found, but plant remains were discovered between the pelvis and ribs of the "Huntington mammoth" when it was excavated in Utah. <a href="Microscopy">Microscopy</a> showed that these chewed remains consisted of <a href="Cyperaceae">sedge</a>, grass, <a href="fir">fir</a> twigs and needles, <a href="oak">oak</a> and <a href="maple">maple</a>. A large amount of mammoth dung has been found in two caves in Utah. The dry conditions and stable temperature of Bechan Cave ("bechan" is <a href="Navajo%20language">Navajo</a> for "large faeces") has preserved 16,000- to 13,500-year-old elephant dung, most likely from Columbian mammoths. The dung consists of 95 percent grass and sedge, and varies from 0 to 25 percent of woody plants between dung <a href="Bolus%20%28digestion%29">boluses</a>, including <a href="saltbush">saltbush</a>, <a href="sagebrush">sagebrush</a>, <a href="Betula%20occidentalis">water birch</a> and <a href="blue%20spruce">blue spruce</a>. This is similar to the diet documented for the woolly mammoth, although browsing seems to have been more important for the Columbian mammoth. The cover of dung is thick, and has a volume of 227 m³ (8,000 cubic ft), with the largest boluses in diameter. The Bechan dung could have been produced by a small group of mammoths over a relatively short time, since adult African elephants drop an average of of dung every two hours and each day.

It has been proposed that giant North American fruits of plants such as the <a href="Maclura%20pomifera">Osage-orange</a>, <a href="Kentucky%20coffeetree">Kentucky coffeetree</a> and <a href="honey%20locust">honey locust</a> evolved in tandem with now-extinct American megafauna such as mammoths and other proboscideans, since there are no extant endemic herbivores able to ingest these fruits and disperse their seeds. Introduced cattle and horses have since taken over this ecological role.

The lifespan of the Columbian mammoth is thought to have been about 80 years. The lifespan of a mammal is related to its size; Columbian mammoths are larger than modern elephants, which have a lifespan of about 60 years. The age of a mammoth can be roughly determined by counting the <a href="Dendrochronology">growth rings</a> of its tusks when viewed in cross section. However, ring-counting does not account for a mammoth's early years; early growth is represented in tusk tips, which are usually worn away. In the remainder of the tusk each major line represents a year, with weekly and daily lines found in between. Dark bands correspond to summer, making it possible to determine the season in which a mammoth died. Tusk growth slowed when foraging became more difficult, such as during illness or when a male mammoth was banished from the herd (male elephants live with their herds until about the age of ten).

Mammoths continued growing during adulthood, as do other elephants. Males grew until age 40, and females until age 25. Mammoths may have had gestation periods of 21–22 months, like those of modern elephants. Columbian mammoths had six sets of molars in the course of a lifetime. At 6–12 months the second set of molars would erupt, with the first set worn out at 18 months of age. The third set of molars lasted for ten years, and this process was repeated until the sixth set emerged at 30 years of age. When the last set of molars wore out the animal would be unable to chew, and would die of starvation.

Almost all vertebrae of the "Huntington mammoth", a very aged specimen, were deformed by arthritic disease, and four of its lumbar vertebrae were fused; some bones also indicate bacterial infection, such as <a href="osteomyelitis">osteomyelitis</a>. The condition of the bones suggests the specimen died of old age and malnutrition.

Columbian mammoths inhabited the southern half of North America, ranging from the northern United States across Mexico as far south as <a href="Costa%20Rica">Costa Rica</a>. One Costa Rican specimen, a molar, was reported in 1963 but has since been lost. The environment in these areas may have had more varied habitats than those inhabited by woolly mammoths in the north (the <a href="mammoth%20steppe">mammoth steppe</a>). Some areas were covered by grass, herbaceous plants, trees and shrubs; their composition varied from region to region, and included <a href="grassland">grassland</a>, <a href="savanna">savanna</a> and <a href="aspen%20parkland">aspen parkland</a> habitats. There were also wooded areas; although mammoths would not have preferred forests, clearings could provide them with grass and herbs.

The Columbian mammoth shared its habitat with other now-extinct Pleistocene mammals (such as "<a href="Glyptodon">Glyptodon</a>", "<a href="Smilodon">Smilodon</a>", <a href="ground%20sloth">ground sloth</a>s, "<a href="Camelops">Camelops</a>" and the <a href="Mastodon">American mastodon</a>), horses and buffalos. It did not live in Arctic Canada, which was inhabited by woolly mammoths. Fossils of woolly and Columbian mammoths have been found in the same place in a few areas of North America where their ranges overlapped, including the Hot Springs Site. It is unknown whether the two species were <a href="sympatry">sympatric</a> and lived there simultaneously, or if the woolly mammoths entered southern areas when Columbian mammoth populations were absent. The Columbian mammoth coexisted with the other extinct proboscideans "<a href="Stegomastodon">Stegomastodon mirificus</a>" and "<a href="Cuvieronius">Cuvieronius tropicus</a>" at sites in Texas and New Mexico during the early <a href="Irvingtonian">Irvingtonian</a>.

Humans entered the Americas through <a href="Beringia">Beringia</a>, and evidence documents their interactions with Columbian mammoths. Tools made from Columbian mammoth remains have been discovered in several North American sites. At Tocuila, Mexico, mammoth bones were quarried 13,000 years ago to produce <a href="lithic%20flake">lithic flake</a>s and <a href="Lithic%20core">cores</a>. At the Lange-Ferguson Site in South Dakota, the remains of two mammoths were found with two 12,800-year-old <a href="Cleaver%20%28tool%29">cleaver</a> <a href="Chopper%20%28archaeology%29">choppers</a> made from a mammoth shoulder blade; the choppers had been used to butcher the mammoths. At the same site, a <a href="Blade%20%28archaeology%29">flake knife</a> made from a long mammoth bone was also found wedged against mammoth vertebrae. At Murray Springs, archaeologists discovered a 13,100-year-old object made from a mammoth femur; the object is thought to be a shaft wrench, a tool for straightening wood and bone to make spear-shafts (the <a href="Inuit">Inuit</a> use similar tools).

The earliest suggested evidence of Columbian mammoth butchering in America (from Lovewell, Kansas) dates from 18,000 to 21,000 years ago. <a href="Paleoamericans">Paleoamericans</a> of the <a href="Clovis%20culture">Clovis culture</a>, which arose roughly 7,000 years later, may have been the first humans to hunt mammoths extensively. These people are thought to have hunted Columbian mammoths with <a href="Clovis%20point">Clovis point</a>ed spears which were thrown or thrust. Although Clovis points have been found with Columbian mammoth remains at several sites, archaeologists disagree about whether the finds represent hunting, scavenging dead mammoths, or are coincidental. A female mammoth at the <a href="Naco-Mammoth%20Kill%20Site">Naco-Mammoth Kill Site</a> in Arizona, found with eight Clovis points near its skull, shoulder blade, ribs and other bones, is considered the most convincing evidence for hunting. In modern experiments, replica spears have been able to penetrate the rib cages of African elephants with re-use causing little damage to the points.

Other sites show more circumstantial evidence of mammoth hunting, such as piled bones bearing butcher marks. Some of these sites are not closely associated with Clovis points. The <a href="Lehner%20Mammoth-Kill%20Site">Lehner Mammoth-Kill Site</a> and the Dent Site, where multiple juvenile and adult mammoths have been found with butcher marks and in association with Clovis points, were once interpreted as the killing of entire herds by Clovis hunters. However, isotope studies have shown that the accumulations represent individual deaths at different seasons of the year, and therefore not herds killed in single incidents. Many other such assemblages of bones with butcher marks may also represent accumulations over time, and are therefore ambiguous as evidence for large scale hunting.

<a href="Petroglyph">Petroglyph</a>s in the <a href="Colorado%20Plateau">Colorado Plateau</a> depict either Columbian mammoths or mastodons. A 13,000-year-old bone fragment from <a href="Vero%20Beach">Vero Beach</a>, Florida, possibly the earliest known example of art in the Americas, is engraved with either a mammoth or a mastodon. 11,000–13,000-year-old petroglyphs from the <a href="San%20Juan%20River%20%28Colorado%20River%29">San Juan River</a> in Utah are thought to include depictions of two Columbian mammoths; the mammoths' domed heads distinguish them from mastodons. They are also shown with two "fingers" on their trunks, a feature known from European depictions of mammoths. The tusks are short, which may indicate they are meant to be females. A carving of a bison (possibly the extinct "<a href="Bison%20antiquus">Bison antiquus</a>") is superimposed on one of the mammoth carvings and may be a later addition. Other possible depictions of Columbian mammoths have been shown to be either misinterpretations or fraudulent.

The Columbian mammoth is the <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20state%20fossils">state fossil</a> of <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a> and <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>. <a href="Nebraska">Nebraska</a>'s state fossil is "Archie", a Columbian mammoth specimen found in the state in 1922. "Archie" is currently on display at <a href="University%20of%20Nebraska%20State%20Museum">Elephant Hall</a> in <a href="Lincoln%2C%20Nebraska">Lincoln, Nebraska</a>, and is the largest mounted mammoth specimen in the United States.

Columbian and woolly mammoths both disappeared during the late Pleistocene and early <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a>, alongside most of the <a href="Pleistocene%20megafauna">Pleistocene megafauna</a>. The most recent Columbian mammoth remains have been dated around 10,900 years ago. This extinction formed part of the <a href="Quaternary%20extinction%20event">Quaternary extinction event</a>, which began 40,000 years ago and peaked between 14,000 and 11,500 years ago. Scientists do not know whether these extinctions happened abruptly or were drawn out. During this period, 40 mammal species disappeared from North America, almost all of which weighed over ; the extinction of the mammoths cannot be explained in isolation.

Scientists are divided over whether climate change, hunting, or a combination of the two, drove the extinction of the Columbian mammoths. According to the climate change hypothesis, warmer weather led to the shrinking of suitable habitat for Columbian mammoths, which turned from parkland to forest, grassland and semi-desert, with less diverse vegetation. The overkill hypothesis, on the other hand, attributes the extinction to hunting by humans. This idea was first proposed by <a href="Paul%20S.%20Martin">Paul S. Martin</a> in 1967; more recent research on this subject have varied in their conclusions. A 2002 study concluded that the archaeological record did not support the overkill hypothesis, given that only 14 Clovis sites (12 with mammoth remains and two with mastodon remains) out of 76 examined provided strong evidence of hunting. In contrast, a 2007 study found that the Clovis record indicated the highest frequency of prehistoric exploitation of proboscideans for subsistence in the world, and supported the overkill hypothesis. Whatever the actual cause of extinction, large mammals are generally more vulnerable than smaller ones due to their smaller population size and low reproduction rates.

Rogožarski IK-3

The Rogožarski IK-3 was a 1930s <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Yugoslav</a> <a href="monoplane">monoplane</a> single-seat <a href="Fighter%20aircraft">fighter</a>, designed by Ljubomir Ilić, Kosta Sivčev and Slobodan Zrnić as a successor to the <a href="Ikarus%20IK-2">Ikarus IK-2</a> fighter. Its armament consisted of a <a href="propeller%20hub">hub</a>-firing <a href="autocannon">autocannon</a> and two <a href="fuselage">fuselage</a>-mounted <a href="Synchronization%20gear">synchronised</a> <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>s. It was considered comparable to foreign aircraft such as the <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%20109">Messerschmitt Bf 109</a>E and came into service in 1940. The <a href="prototype">prototype</a> crashed during testing; a total of twelve production aircraft had been delivered by July 1940.

Six IK-3s were serviceable when the <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invasion of Yugoslavia</a> began on 6 April 1941. All six were in service with the 51st Independent Fighter Group at <a href="Zemun">Zemun</a> near <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a>. Pilots flying the IK-3 claimed 11 aircraft shot down during the 11-day conflict. According to one account, to prevent them from falling into German hands, the surviving aircraft and incomplete <a href="airframe">airframe</a>s were destroyed by their crews and factory staff. Another account suggests that one aircraft survived the invasion and was later destroyed by <a href="sabotage">sabotage</a>. The IK-3 design was the basis for the post-war Yugoslav-built <a href="Ikarus%20S-49">Ikarus S-49</a> fighter.

In the late 1920s, the <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Air%20Force">Royal Yugoslav Air Force</a> (, VVKJ) and the Royal Aero Club of Yugoslavia helped send aspiring aeronautical engineers to France to gain knowledge. It was intended that after this advanced training, they would return to Yugoslavia and be offered specialist roles in the VVKJ or in the aeronautical industry. Ljubomir Ilić and Kosta Sivčev went through this program but, when they returned to Yugoslavia, both were employed in administrative work. Frustrated by this, they decided in 1931 to design a replacement for the <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>n-built <a href="Avia%20BH-33">Avia BH-33</a>E biplane fighter in service with the VVKJ. Working in a basement in Belgrade, and later in Ilić's apartment in <a href="Novi%20Sad">Novi Sad</a>, they secretly devoted their spare time to work on their design. They originally planned a low-wing <a href="monoplane">monoplane</a> with <a href="Landing%20gear">retractable landing gear</a>. Contemporary thinking within the VVKJ led them to evolve their initial ideas into a strut-braced <a href="Gull%20wing">gull-wing</a> monoplane armed with a <a href="propeller%20hub">hub</a>-firing <a href="autocannon">autocannon</a> and <a href="fuselage">fuselage</a>-mounted <a href="Synchronization%20gear">synchronised</a> <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>s. The design concept for what became the <a href="Ikarus%20IK-2">Ikarus IK-2</a> was submitted to the VVKJ on 22 September 1933. With this work completed, Ilić and Sivčev had time to start preliminary development of a new low-wing monoplane that could better meet and defeat the high performance bomber <a href="prototype">prototype</a>s then in development by potential adversaries.

Ilić and Sivčev's new streamlined low-wing monoplane design had a retractable undercarriage. Like the IK-2 it was initially developed privately by the two men. A scale model was tested in the Eiffel-built wind tunnel in Paris, but the pair soon realised that they needed a third engineer to help evaluate the design and determine the structural details. Slobodan Zrnić, the head of construction at the Yugoslav State Aircraft Factory in <a href="Kraljevo">Kraljevo</a>, was recruited, as he had worked as a specialist aircraft engineer in France. The project name for the IK-2 was changed from IK, standing for (Ljubomir) Ilić and Kosta (Sivčev), to IKZ, to include Zrnić. This name was changed, possibly due to the similarities between the Cyrillic "<a href="Ze%20%28Cyrillic%29">З</a>" (Z) and the Arabic numeral "3", and the aircraft became known as the IK-3. The aircraft was to be powered by a <a href="Hispano-Suiza%2012Y">Hispano-Suiza 12Y</a>29 engine, generating at an altitude of . The designers favoured manoeuvrability over speed, trying to find a compromise between the German and British concepts of a modern monoplane fighter. The design had a smaller wing area than the <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a> and the <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a>, to achieve a higher speed for the engine power. In comparison to the <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%20109">Messerschmitt Bf 109</a>, the Yugoslav design had a shorter fuselage and smaller turning radius. It differed from British and German design concepts in that its proposed armament was concentrated in the fuselage.

The designs were delivered to the VVKJ in time for approval by mid-1936, but a general reluctance to adopt new concepts delayed the IK-3, and a contract for the production of the prototype was not signed until March 1937. The company selected for construction was <a href="Rogo%C5%BEarski">Rogožarski</a> A.D. in Belgrade. The first flight of the prototype was carried out by the VVKJ Test Group towards the end of May 1938 and the aircraft was then flown by a group of VVKJ officers who were to determine the best employment for it within the VVKJ, along with tactics to be used in Yugoslav conditions. These pilots observed that the controls were highly sensitive; the only real criticisms related to the visual distortion caused by the curved panels of the <a href="Aircraft%20canopy">canopy</a>. Some pilots believed that the fuselage-mounted armament should be supplemented by two wing-mounted machine guns. The test pilots also had to compare the performance of the IK-3 with the <a href="Hawker%20Fury">Hawker Fury</a>, <a href="Heinkel%20He%20112">Heinkel He 112</a>, <a href="Morane-Saulnier%20M.S.406">Morane-Saulnier M.S. 405</a> and Hawker Hurricane. They concluded that the IK-3 most closely matched the Morane-Saulnier; the Yugoslav aircraft was faster. In November 1938, the VVKJ placed an order with Rogožarski for 12 aircraft.

On 19 January 1939, test pilot "<a href="Captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">Kapetan</a>" Milan Pokorni put the prototype into a steep dive. When he reached , the <a href="windscreen">windscreen</a> detached from the aircraft; Pokorni pulled up hard and the strain broke off half of the <a href="starboard">starboard</a> wing. The aircraft crashed, and Pokorni was killed. An inquiry determined that modifications to the windscreen had contributed to the accident. Engineers recalculated the stress factors on the airframe and they were found to be safe, and the main factor had been the pilot's handling of the highly sensitive controls.

The loss of the prototype and some changes in the construction of the production model delayed the fulfilment of the contract. Further tests were conducted on the wing and it was found to withstand a <a href="g-force">g-force</a> of 14. Modifications were made for the production model, including the use of flat <a href="Poly%28methyl%20methacrylate%29">plexiglass</a> panels in the windscreen and the canopy to provide better visibility. The instrument layout was improved and the upper rear fuselage behind the pilot's seat was re-shaped. The folding undercarriage leg covers were replaced by single plates. The main changes were the replacement of the engine with a modified version of the Hispano-Suiza 12Y engine made under licence by the Czechoslovak company <a href="Avia">Avia</a> and the replacement of the <a href="Hispano-Suiza%20HS.404">Hispano-Suiza HS.404 cannon</a> by a Swiss-made <a href="Oerlikon%2020%20mm%20cannon">Oerlikon FF 20 mm cannon</a>. The replacement engine was less powerful, generating at . German-made <a href="Telefunken">Telefunken</a> radios were to be installed but delays meant that only the first aircraft was delivered with a radio. The production aircraft were numbered 2–13; the prototype was number 1. The aircraft were built at the Rogožarski factory in Belgrade and assembled at the company <a href="hangar">hangar</a> at Zemun. The first six aircraft were delivered by late March 1940; delivery of the rest of the order was delayed until July due to delays by foreign suppliers. The first production aircraft was delivered to the VVKJ Test Group, where it was confirmed that the production aircraft were free of the faults in the prototype. The Test Group determined that the maximum speed, previously estimated at , was , at an altitude of . By July 1940, a further series of 25 IK-3s had commenced construction at the Rogožarski factory.

A shortage of engines was a major obstacle to mass production and development of the IK-3, so tests were conducted with more powerful engines, including the <a href="Daimler-Benz%20DB%20601">Daimler-Benz DB 601</a>, <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Merlin">Rolls-Royce Merlin</a> II and Hispano-Suiza 12Y51. The tests were incomplete at the time of the <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> invasion, and the only prototype to be fitted with a non-production engine was deliberately destroyed by factory personnel during the invasion, along with the incomplete production aircraft. Development of a dual-control two-seat trainer variant of the IK-3 had commenced but pressure on the design team had delayed the completion of the project when the invasion intervened.

The development of the IK-3 encouraged the three designers to pursue the idea of a twin-engined fighter, capable of long-range reconnaissance, photographic reconnaissance and operation as a "destroyer" or <a href="heavy%20fighter">heavy fighter</a> similar to the <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%20110">Messerschmitt Bf 110</a>. The concept included both one-seater and two-seater versions. Development of this new aircraft, designated IK-5, was commenced on the back of the success of the IK-3. The VVKJ ordered a one-seater prototype in early July 1939, with its first flight scheduled for late 1941. At the time of the invasion, the production of the IK-5 prototype was well advanced, but it was not pursued either during or after the war. The advanced Yugoslav <a href="Ikarus%20S-49">Ikarus S-49</a> fighter, produced after World War II, was based on the IK-3.

When they entered service, the IK-3 suffered from minor equipment and instrument faults, largely caused by deficiencies in the Yugoslav aeronautical industry which had resulted in a mixture of foreign and Yugoslav-made instruments being fitted to the aircraft. The Yugoslav Minister of War approved the acquisition of a further 48 IK-3s to be delivered in 1941–42. The operational aircraft were allocated to the 51st Independent Fighter Group at Zemun, six each to the 161st Fighter <a href="Squadron%20%28aviation%29">Squadron</a> ("Kapetan" Savo Poljanec) and the 162nd Fighter Squadron ("Kapetan" Todor Gogić). The IK-3 was then tested against Yugoslav Messerschmitt Bf 109Es in mock dogfights. The evaluation concluded that the IK-3 had several advantages over the Bf 109E; the Yugoslav aircraft was more manoeuvrable in level flight, enabling it to quickly get behind a pursuing Bf 109E by making tight horizontal turns.

In its first year of service, an IK-3 was lost when one of the squadron commanders, "Kapetan" Anton Ercigoj, was making a mock attack on a <a href="Potez%2025">Potez 25</a> over the confluence of the <a href="Sava">Sava</a> and <a href="Danube">Danube</a> rivers. After passing below the Potez, he went into a climb with the intention of performing a loop. His rate of climb was too steep and the aircraft fell into a spin at low altitude and hit the water. Before the Axis <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invasion of Yugoslavia</a> in early April 1941, the 51st Fighter Group was placed under the 6th Fighter <a href="Regiment">Regiment</a>, which was responsible for the defence of Belgrade. The 51st Fighter Group was further reinforced the day before the invasion began, with the 102nd Fighter Squadron equipped with Bf 109Es. When the invasion began on 6 April, the two IK-3 squadrons had only three serviceable aircraft each.

The invasion commenced with a wave of 234 German <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s and <a href="medium%20bomber">medium bomber</a>s attacking Belgrade. Escorted by 120 fighters, the bombers reached Belgrade at 07:00; they were met by the 51st Fighter Group, minus an IK-3 from the 161st Fighter Squadron that had developed engine trouble after takeoff and was unable to engage. The other five IK-3s were the first to meet the initial bomber wave but they were almost immediately attacked by Bf 109Es of <a href="Jagdgeschwader%2077">"Jagdgeschwader" 77</a>. The pilots of the IK-3s claimed five German aircraft, and one aircraft from each Yugoslav squadron was lost. Poljanec had claimed a twin-engined bomber and a Bf 109E; when he returned to Zemun in his badly damaged aircraft, he was strafed by a Messerschmitt 110, which further damaged his aircraft and wounded him. After this encounter, only three IK-3s were serviceable, including the one that had developed engine difficulties prior to the first German wave.

A second wave of German aircraft arrived over Belgrade at 10:00 and the remaining IK-3s were scrambled with the rest of the 51st Fighter Group but the IK-3 pilots claimed no victories. A joint claim was made during the third German attack at 14:00, a twin-engined bomber by Gogić and another pilot from the 162nd Fighter Squadron. The following day, the IK-3 pilots made five or six <a href="sortie">sortie</a>s against German bomber formations and their fighter escorts, and claimed three bombers between them. At 17:00, Milislav Semiz attacked a tight formation of three bombers; his aircraft received 56 hits from return fire, 20 of which were in the engine and propeller, but he managed to land the aircraft. The return of another IK-3 from the workshops meant that the number of serviceable IK-3s remained at three.

It became difficult to continue activity from the 51st Fighter Group airfield at Zemun due to air attacks, so on 8 April the remaining IK-3s and Bf 109Es flew to an auxiliary airfield at <a href="Veliki%20Radinci">Veliki Radinci</a>, north-west of Belgrade, where the surviving aircraft of the 6th Fighter Regiment were concentrated. Poor weather made operations impossible until 11 April, when Semiz shot down a Bf 110 that had strafed the airfield. Later that day, Gogić and another IK-3 pilot claimed one <a href="Ju%2087">Ju 87</a> each during a patrol. That night, German troops approached within of the airfield at Veliki Radinci and the following day all remaining aircraft of the 6th Fighter Regiment, including the remaining IK-3s, were burned by their crews. According to aviation writers Dragan Savić and Boris Ciglić, one serviceable IK-3 was captured by the Germans in April 1941 and it was joined by another by the end of June. Both aircraft were located at Zemun, along with 23 other former VVKJ aircraft in working condition that were destined for service with the <a href="Air%20Force%20of%20the%20Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">air force</a> of the Axis puppet state, the <a href="Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">Independent State of Croatia</a>. The Germans had used a fence to separate the serviceable aircraft from other aircraft that had been earmarked for scrapping. In late June, while the German guards were distracted listening to news of <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">the invasion of the Soviet Union</a>, local communists, including former VVKJ mechanics, moved the fence. As a result, all the serviceable aircraft were scrapped, including the two IK-3s.

"The IK-3s put up a valiant resistance against the Luftwaffe," wrote William Green, "scoring a number of 'kills' before they were finally destroyed in combat." Aviation writers Šime Oštrić and Čedomir Janić credit the IK-3 pilots with 11 victories, Semiz being the most successful, with four victories.

Stegoceras

Stegoceras is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="Pachycephalosauria">pachycephalosaurid</a> (dome-headed) <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> that lived in what is now <a href="North%20America">North America</a> during the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> <a href="Period%20%28geology%29">period</a>, about 77.5 to 74 million years ago (mya). The first specimens from <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>, Canada, were described in 1902, and the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> Stegoceras validum was based on these remains. The generic name means "horn roof", and the specific name means "strong". Several other species have been placed in the genus over the years, but these have since been moved to other genera or deemed <a href="junior%20synonyms">junior synonyms</a>. Currently only "S. validum" and S. novomexicanum, named in 2011 from fossils found in <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>, remain. The validity of the latter species has also been debated.

"Stegoceras" was a small, <a href="bipedal">bipedal</a> dinosaur about long, and weighed around . It had a rigid <a href="vertebral%20column">vertebral column</a>, and a stiffened tail. The pelvic region was broad, perhaps due to an extended gut. The skull was roughly triangular with a short snout, and had a thick, broad, and relatively smooth dome on the top. The back of the skull had a thick "shelf" over the <a href="occiput">occiput</a>, and it had a thick ridge over the eyes. Much of the skull was ornamented by <a href="tubercles">tubercles</a> (or round "outgrowths") and nodes (or "knobs"), many in rows, and the largest formed small horns on the shelf. The teeth were small and serrated. The skull is thought to have been flat in juvenile animals and to have grown into a dome with age.

Originally known only from skull domes, "Stegoceras" was one of the first known pachycephalosaurs, and the incompleteness of these initial remains led to many theories about the affinities of this group. A complete "Stegoceras" skull with associated parts of the skeleton was found in 1924, which shed more light on these animals. Pachycephalosaurs are today grouped with the horned <a href="ceratopsians">ceratopsians</a> in the group <a href="Marginocephalia">Marginocephalia</a>. "Stegoceras" itself has been considered <a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> (or "primitive") compared to other pachycephalosaurs. "Stegoceras" was most likely herbivorous, and it probably had a good sense of smell. The function of the dome has been debated, and competing theories include use in <a href="intra-specific%20combat">intra-specific combat</a> (head or flank-butting), <a href="sexual%20display">sexual display</a>, or <a href="species%20recognition">species recognition</a>. "S. validum" is known from the <a href="Dinosaur%20Park%20Formation">Dinosaur Park Formation</a> and the <a href="Oldman%20Formation">Oldman Formation</a>, whereas "S. novomexicanum" is from the <a href="Fruitland%20Formation">Fruitland</a> and <a href="Kirtland%20Formation">Kirtland Formation</a>.

"Stegoceras" is one of the most completely known North American <a href="pachycephalosaurs">pachycephalosaurs</a>, and one of the few known from <a href="postcranial">postcranial</a> remains; "S. validum" specimen UALVP 2 is the most complete "Stegoceras" individual known to date. Its length is estimated to have been about , comparable to the size of a goat. The weight has been estimated to be about . "Stegoceras" was small to medium in size compared to other pachycephalosaurs. "S. novomexicanum" appears to have been smaller than "S. validum", but it is disputed whether the known specimens (incomplete skulls) are adults or juveniles.

The <a href="vertebral%20column">vertebral column</a> of "Stegoceras" is incompletely known. The articulation between the <a href="zygagophyses">zygagophyses</a> (articular processes) of successive dorsal (back) vertebrae appears to have prevented sideways movement of the vertebral column, which made it very rigid, and it was further strengthened by . Though the neck vertebrae are not known, the downturned <a href="occipital%20condyle">occipital condyle</a> (which articulates with the first neck vertebra) indicates that the neck was held in a curved posture, like the "S"- or "U"-shape of most dinosaur necks. Based on their position in the pachycephalosaur "<a href="Homalocephale">Homalocephale</a>", the ossified tendons found with UALVP 2 would have formed an intricate "" in the tail, consisting of parallel rows, with the extremities of each tendon contacting the next successively. Such structures are called , and are otherwise only known in <a href="teleost%20fish">teleost fish</a>; the feature is unique to pachycephalosaurs among <a href="tetrapod">tetrapod</a> (four-limbed) animals, and may have functioned in stiffening the tail.

The <a href="scapula">scapula</a> (shoulder blade) was longer than the <a href="humerus">humerus</a> (upper arm bone); its blade was slender and narrow, and slightly twisted, following the contour of the ribs. The scapula did not expand at the upper end but was very expanded at the base. The <a href="coracoid">coracoid</a> was mainly thin and plate-like. The humerus had a slender shaft, was slightly twisted along its length, and was slightly bowed. The (where the <a href="Deltoid%20muscle">deltoid</a> and <a href="Pectoralis%20major%20muscle">pectoral</a> muscles attached) was weakly developed. The ends of the <a href="ulna">ulna</a> were expanded, and ridges extended along the shaft. The <a href="radius">radius</a> was more robust than the ulna, which is unusual. When seen from above, the <a href="pelvic%20girdle">pelvic girdle</a> was very broad for a <a href="Bipedalism">bipedal</a> <a href="archosaur">archosaur</a>, and became wider towards the hind part. The broadness of the pelvic region may have accommodated a rear extension of the gut. The <a href="ilium%20%28bone%29">ilium</a> was elongated and the <a href="ischium">ischium</a> was long and slender. Though the <a href="pubis%20%28bone%29">pubis</a> is not known, it was probably reduced in size like that of "Homalocephale". The <a href="femur">femur</a> (thigh bone) was slender and inwards curved, the tibia was slender and twisted, and the <a href="fibula">fibula</a> was slender and wide at the upper end. The <a href="metatarsus">metatarsus</a> of the foot appears to have been narrow, and the single known <a href="ungual">ungual</a> (claw bone) of a toe was slender and slightly curved. Though the limbs of "Stegoceras" are not completely known, they were most likely like other pachycephalosaurs in having five-fingered hands and four toes.

The skull of "Stegoceras" was roughly triangular in shape when viewed from the side, with a relatively short snout. The <a href="Frontal%20bone">frontal</a> and <a href="parietal%20bone">parietal bone</a>s were very thick and formed an elevated dome. The <a href="suture%20%28anatomy%29">suture</a> between these two elements was obliterated (only faintly visible in some specimens), and they are collectively termed the "frontoparietal". The frontoparietal dome was broad and had a relatively smooth surface, with only the sides being rugose (wrinkled). It was narrowed above and between the <a href="Orbit%20%28anatomy%29">orbita</a> (eye sockets). The frontoparietal narrowed at the back, was wedged between the <a href="squamosal%20bone">squamosal bone</a>s, and ended in a depression above the at the back of the skull. The parietal and squamosal bones formed a thick shelf over the occiput termed the parietosquamosal shelf, whose extent varied between specimens. The squamosal was large, not part of the dome, and the back part was swollen. It was ornamented by irregularly spaced <a href="tubercles">tubercles</a> (or round outgrowths), and a row of nodes (knobs) extended along its upper edges, ending in a pointed tubercle (or small horn) on each side at the back of the skull. An inner row of smaller tubercles ran parallel with the larger one. Except for the upper surface of the dome, much of the skull was ornamented with nodes, many arranged in rows.

The large orbit was shaped like an imperfect ellipse (with the longest axis from front to back), and faced to the side and slightly forward. The <a href="infratemporal%20fenestra">infratemporal fenestra</a> (opening) behind the eye was narrow and sloped backwards, and the <a href="supratemporal%20fenestra">supratemporal fenestra</a> on the top back of the skull was very reduced in size, due to the thickening of the frontoparietal. The (floor of the ) was shortened and distanced from the regions below the orbits and around the <a href="palate">palate</a>. The occiput sloped backwards and down, and the occipital condyle was deflected in the same direction. The <a href="lacrimal%20bone">lacrimal bone</a> formed the lower front margin of the orbit, and its surface had rows of node-like ornamentation. The <a href="prefrontal%20bone">prefrontal</a> and <a href="palpebral%20bone">palpebral bone</a>s were fused and formed a thick ridge above the orbit. The relatively large <a href="jugal%20bone">jugal bone</a> formed the lower margin of the orbit, extending far forwards and down towards the jaw joint. It was ornamented with ridges and nodes in a radiating arrangement.

The nasal openings were large and faced frontwards. The <a href="nasal%20bone">nasal bone</a> was thick, heavily sculpted, and had a convex profile. It formed a boss (shield) on the middle top of the skull together with the frontal bone. The lower front of the <a href="premaxilla">premaxilla</a> (front bone of the upper jaw) was rugose and thickened. A small <a href="foramen">foramen</a> (hole) was present in the suture between the premaxillae, leading into the <a href="nasal%20cavity">nasal cavity</a>, and possibly connected to the <a href="Jacobson%27s%20organ">Jacobson's organ</a> (an <a href="olfactory">olfactory</a> sense organ). The maxilla was short and deep, and probably contained a <a href="Sinus%20%28anatomy%29">sinus</a>. The maxilla had a series of foramina that corresponded with each tooth position there, and these functioned as passages for erupting replacement teeth. The mandible articulated with the skull below the back of the orbit. The tooth-bearing part of the lower jaw was long, with the part behind being rather short. Though not preserved, the presence of a <a href="predentary%20bone">predentary bone</a> is indicated by facets at the front of the lower jaw. Like other pachycephalosaurs, it would have had a small beak.

"Stegoceras" had teeth that were <a href="heterodont">heterodont</a> (differentiated) and (placed in sockets). It had marginal rows of relatively small teeth, and the rows did not form a straight cutting edge. The teeth were set obliquely along the length of the jaws, and overlapped each other slightly from front to back. On each side, the most complete specimen (UALVP 2) had three teeth in the premaxilla, sixteen in the <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a> (both part of the upper jaw), and seventeen in the <a href="dentary">dentary</a> of the lower jaw. The teeth in the premaxilla were separated from those behind in the maxilla by a short <a href="diastema">diastema</a> (space), and the two rows in the premaxilla were separated by a toothless gap at the front. The teeth in the front part of the upper jaw (premaxilla) and front lower jaw were similar; these had taller, more pointed and recurved crowns, and a "heel" at the back. The front teeth in the lower jaw were larger than those of the upper jaw. The front edges of the crowns bore eight <a href="Denticle%20%28tooth%20feature%29">denticles</a> (serrations), and the back edge bore nine to eleven. The teeth in the back of the upper (maxilla) and lower jaw were triangular in side view and compressed in front view. They had long roots that were oval in section, and the crowns had a marked at their bases. The denticles here were compressed and directed towards the top of the crowns. Both the outer and inner side of the <a href="tooth%20crowns">tooth crowns</a> bore <a href="Tooth%20enamel">enamel</a>, and both sides were divided vertically by a ridge. Each edge had about seven or eight denticles, with the front edge usually having the most.

The skull of "Stegoceras" can be distinguished from those of other pachycephalosaurs by features such as its pronounced parietosquamosal shelf (though this became smaller with age), the "incipient" doming of its frontopariental (though the doming increased with age), its inflated nasal bones, its ornamentation of tubercles on the sides and back of the squamosal bones, rows of up to six tubercles on the upper side of each squamosal, and up to two nodes on the backwards projection of the parietal. It is also distinct in its lack of nasal ornamentation, and in having a reduced diastema. The skull of "S. novomexicanum" can be distinguished from that of "S. validum" in features such as the backwards extension of the parietal bone being more reduced and triangular, having larger supratemporal fenestrae (though this may be due to the possible juvenile status of the specimens), and having roughly parallel suture contacts between the squamosal and parietal. It also appears to have had a smaller frontal boss than "S. validum", and seems to have been more gracile overall.

The first known remains of "Stegoceras" were collected by Canadian <a href="Paleontology">palaeontologist</a> <a href="Lawrence%20Lambe">Lawrence Lambe</a> from the <a href="Belly%20River%20Group">Belly River Group</a>, in the <a href="Red%20Deer%20River">Red Deer River</a> district of Alberta, <a href="Canada">Canada</a>. These remains consisted of two partial skull domes (specimens CMN 515 and CMN 1423 in the <a href="Canadian%20Museum%20of%20Nature">Canadian Museum of Nature</a>) from two animals of different sizes collected in 1898, and a third partial dome (CMN 1594) collected in 1901. Based on these specimens, Lambe described and named the new <a href="monotypic">monotypic</a> genus and species "Stegoceras validus" in <a href="1902%20in%20paleontology">1902</a>. The generic name "Stegoceras" comes from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> "stegè"/στέγη, meaning "roof" and "keras"/κέρας meaning "horn". The specific name "validus" means "strong" in Latin, possibly in reference to the thick skull-roof. Because the species was based on multiple specimens (a <a href="syntype%20series">syntype series</a>), CMN 515 was designated as the <a href="lectotype%20specimen">lectotype specimen</a> by <a href="John%20Bell%20Hatcher">John Bell Hatcher</a> in 1907.

As no similar remains had been found in the area before, Lambe was unsure of what kind of dinosaur they were, and whether they represented one species or more; he suggested the domes were "prenasals" situated before the <a href="nasal%20bones">nasal bones</a> on the midline of the head, and noted their similarity to the nasal horn-core of a "<a href="Triceratops">Triceratops</a>" specimen. In 1903, Hungarian palaeontologist <a href="Franz%20Nopcsa%20von%20Fels%C5%91-Szilv%C3%A1s">Franz Nopcsa von Felső-Szilvás</a> suggested that the fragmentary domes of "Stegoceras" were in fact frontal and nasal bones, and that the animal would therefore have had a single, unpaired horn. Lambe was sympathetic to this idea of a new type of "unicorn dinosaur" in a 1903 review of Nopscsa's paper. At this time, there was still uncertainty over which group of dinosaur "Stegoceras" belonged to, with both <a href="ceratopsians">ceratopsians</a> (horned dinosaurs) and <a href="stegosaurs">stegosaurs</a> (plated dinosaurs) as contenders. Hatcher doubted whether the "Stegoceras" specimens belonged to the same species and whether they were dinosaurs at all, and suggested the domes consisted of the frontal, occipital, and parietal bones of the skull. In 1918, Lambe referred another dome (CMN 138) to "S. validus", and named a new species, "S. brevis", based on specimen CMN 1423 (which he originally included in "S. validus"). By this time, he considered these animals as members of Stegosauria (then composed of both families of armoured dinosaurs, <a href="Stegosauridae">Stegosauridae</a> and <a href="Ankylosauridae">Ankylosauridae</a>), in a new family he called Psalisauridae (named for the vaulted or dome-shaped skull roof).

In 1924, the American palaeontologist <a href="Charles%20W.%20Gilmore">Charles W. Gilmore</a> described a complete skull of "S. validus" with associated postcranial remains (specimen UALVP 2 in the <a href="University%20of%20Alberta">University of Alberta</a> Laboratory for Vertebrate Palaeontology), until then the most complete remains of a dome-headed dinosaur. This find confirmed Hatcher's interpretation of the domes as consisting of the frontoparietal area of the skull. UALVP 2 was found with small, disarticulated bony elements, then thought to be <a href="gastralium">gastralia</a> (abdominal ribs), which are not known in other <a href="ornithischia">ornithischia</a>n dinosaurs (one of the two main groups of dinosaurs). Gilmore pointed out that the teeth of "S. validus" were very similar to those of the species "<a href="Troodon%20formosus">Troodon formosus</a>" (named in 1856 and by then only known from isolated teeth), and described a skull dome discovered close to the locality where "Troodon" was found. Therefore, Gilmore considered "Stegoceras" an invalid <a href="junior%20synonym">junior synonym</a> of "Troodon", thereby renaming "S. validus" into "T. validus", and suggested that even the two species might be the same. Furthermore, he found "S. brevis" to be identical to "S. validus", and therefore a junior synonym of the latter. He also placed these species in the new family <a href="Troodontidae">Troodontidae</a> (since Lambe had not selected a type genus for his Psalisauridae), which he considered closest to the <a href="ornithopod">ornithopod</a> dinosaurs. Because the skull seemed so specialized compared to the rather "primitive"-looking skeleton, Nopcsa doubted whether these parts actually belonged together, and suggested the skull belonged to a <a href="nodosaur">nodosaur</a>, the skeleton to an ornithopod, and the supposed gastralia (belly ribs) to a fish. This claim was rebutted by Gilmore and Loris S. Russell in the 1930s.

Gilmore's classification was supported by the American palaeontologists <a href="Barnum%20Brown">Barnum Brown</a> and <a href="Erich%20Maren%20Schlaikjer">Erich Maren Schlaikjer</a> in their 1943 review of the dome-headed dinosaurs, by then known from 46 skulls. From these specimens, Brown and Schlaikjer named the new species "T. sternbergi" and "T. edmontonensis" (both from Alberta), as well as moving the large species "T. wyomingensis" (which was named in 1931) to the new genus "<a href="Pachycephalosaurus">Pachycephalosaurus</a>", along with two other species. They found "T. validus" distinct from "T. formosus", but considered "S. brevis" the female form of "T. validus", and therefore a junior synonym. By this time, the dome-headed dinosaurs were either considered relatives of ornithopods or of ankylosaurs. In 1945, after examining casts of "T. formosus" and "S. validus" teeth, the American palaeontologist <a href="Charles%20M.%20Sternberg">Charles M. Sternberg</a> demonstrated differences between the two, and instead suggested that "Troodon" was a <a href="theropod">theropod</a> dinosaur, and that the dome-headed dinosaurs should be placed in their own family. Though "Stegoceras" was the first member of this family to be named, Sternberg named the group <a href="Pachycephalosauridae">Pachycephalosauridae</a> after the second genus, as he found that name (meaning "thick head lizard") more descriptive. He also considered "T. sternbergi" and "T. edmontonensis" members of "Stegoceras", found "S. brevis" valid, and named a new species, "S. lambei", based on a specimen formerly referred to "S. validus". The split from "Troodon" was supported by Russell in 1948, who described a theropod dentary with teeth almost identical to those of "T. formosus".

In 1953, <a href="Birger%20Bohlin">Birger Bohlin</a> named "Troodon" "bexelli" based on a parietal bone from China. In 1964, <a href="Oskar%20Kuhn">Oskar Kuhn</a> considered this as an unequivocal species of "Stegoceras"; "S. bexelli". In 1974, the Polish palaeontologists <a href="Teresa%20Marya%C5%84ska">Teresa Maryańska</a> and <a href="Halszka%20Osm%C3%B3lska">Halszka Osmólska</a> concluded that the "gastralia" of "Stegoceras" were ossified tendons, after identifying such structures in the tail of "Homalocephale". In 1979, William Patrick Wall and <a href="Peter%20Galton">Peter Galton</a> named the new species "Stegoceras browni", based on a flattened dome, formerly described as a female "S. validus" by Galton in 1971. The specific name honours Barnum Brown, who found the <a href="holotype%20specimen">holotype specimen</a> (specimen AMNH 5450 in the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a>) in Alberta. In 1983, Galton and <a href="Hans-Dieter%20Sues">Hans-Dieter Sues</a> moved "S. browni" to its own genus, "Ornatotholus" ("ornatus" is Latin for "adorned" and "tholus" for "dome"), and considered it the first known American member of a group of "flat-headed" pachycephalosaurs, previously known from Asia. In a 1987 review of the pachycephalosaurs, Sues and Galton emended the specific name "validus" to "validum", which has subsequently been used in the scientific literature. These authors synonymized "S. brevis", "S. sternbergi", and "S. lambei" with "S. validum", found that "S. bexelli" differed from "Stegoceras" in several features, and considered it an indeterminate pachycephalosaur.

In 1998, Goodwin and colleagues considered "Ornatotholus" a juvenile "S. validum", therefore a junior synonym. In 2000, Robert M. Sullivan referred "S. edmontonensis" and "S. brevis" to the genus "<a href="Prenocephale">Prenocephale</a>" (until then only known from the Mongolian species "P. prenes"), and found it more likely that "S. bexelli" belonged to "Prenocephale" than to "Stegoceras", but considered it a "<a href="nomen%20dubium">nomen dubium</a>" (dubious name, without distinguishing characters) due to its incompleteness, and noted its holotype specimen appeared to be lost. In 2003, Thomas E. Williamson and <a href="Thomas%20Carr%20%28paleontologist%29">Thomas Carr</a> considered "Ornatotholus" a "nomen dubium", or perhaps a juvenile "Stegoceras". In a 2003 revision of "Stegoceras", Sullivan agreed that "Ornatotholus" was a junior synonym of "Stegoceras", moved "S. lambei" to the new genus "<a href="Colepiocephale">Colepiocephale</a>", and "S. sternbergi" to "<a href="Hanssuesia">Hanssuesia</a>". He stated that the genus "Stegoceras" had become a <a href="wastebasket%20taxon">wastebasket taxon</a> for small to medium-sized North American pachycephalosaurs until that point. By this time, dozens of specimens had been referred to "S. validum", including many domes too incomplete to be identified as "Stegoceras" with certainty. UALVP 2 is still the most complete specimen of "Stegoceras", upon which most scientific understanding of the genus is based.

In 2002, Williamson and Carr described a dome (specimen NMMNH P-33983 in the <a href="New%20Mexico%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History%20and%20Science">New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science</a>) from the <a href="San%20Juan%20Basin">San Juan Basin</a>, <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>, which they considered a juvenile pachycephalosaur of uncertain species (though perhaps "Sphaerotholus goodwini"). In 2006, Sullivan and Spencer G. Lucas considered it a juvenile "S. validum", which would expand the range of the species considerably. In <a href="2011%20in%20paleontology">2011</a>, Steven E. Jasinski and Sullivan considered the specimen an adult, and made it the holotype of the new species "Stegoceras novomexicanum", with two other specimens (SMP VP-2555 and SMP VP-2790) as paratypes. A 2011 <a href="Phylogenetics">phylogenetic analysis</a> by Watabe and colleagues did not place the two "Stegoceras" species close to each other. In 2016, Williamson and <a href="Stephen%20L.%20Brusatte">Stephen L. Brusatte</a> restudied the holotype of "S. novomexicanum" and found that the paratypes did not belong to the same taxon as the holotype, and that all the involved specimens were juveniles. Furthermore, they were unable to determine whether the holotype specimen represented the distinct species "S. novomexicanum", or if it was a juvenile of either "S. validum" or "Sphaerotholus goodwini", or another previously known pachycephalosaur. In 2016, Jasinski and Sullivan defended the validity of "S. novomexicanum"; they agreed that some features used to diagnose the species were indicative of a sub-adult stage, but presented additional diagnostic features in the holotype that distinguish the species. They also pointed out some adult features, which may indicate <a href="heterochrony">heterochrony</a> (difference in timing of <a href="Ontogeny">ontogenetic</a> changes between related taxa) in the species. They conceded that the paratypes and other assigned specimens differed from the holotype in having more highly domed skulls, instead referring to them as <a href="cf.">cf.</a> "S. novomexicanum" (difficult to identify), but found it likely they all belonged to the same taxon (with the assigned specimens being adults), due to the restricted <a href="stratigraphic">stratigraphic</a> interval and geographic range.

During the 1970s, more pachycephalosaur genera were described from Asian fossils, which provided more information about the group. In 1974, Maryańska and Osmólska concluded that pachycephalosaurs are distinct enough to warrant their own <a href="suborder">suborder</a> within Ornithischia, Pachycephalosauria. In 1978, the Chinese palaeontologist <a href="Dong%20Zhiming">Dong Zhiming</a> split Pachycephalosauria into two families; the dome-headed Pachycephalosauridae (including "Stegoceras") and the flat-headed Homalocephalidae (originally spelled Homalocephaleridae). Wall and Galton did not find suborder status for the pachycephalosaurs justified in 1979. By the 1980s, the affinities of the pachycephalosaurs within Ornithischia were unresolved. The main competing views were that the group was closest to either ornithopods or ceratopsians, the latter view due to similarities between the skeleton of "Stegoceras" and the "primitive" ceratopsian "<a href="Protoceratops">Protoceratops</a>". In 1986, American palaeontologist <a href="Paul%20Sereno">Paul Sereno</a> supported the relationship between pachycephalosaurs and ceratopsians, and united them in the group <a href="Marginocephalia">Marginocephalia</a>, based on similar cranial features, such as the "shelf"-structure above the occiput. He conceded that the evidence for this grouping was not overwhelming, but the validity of the group was supported by Sues and Galton in 1987.

By the early 21st century, few pachycephalosaur genera were known from postcranial remains, and many taxa were only known from domes, which made classification within the group difficult. Pachycephalosaurs are thus mainly defined by cranial features, such as the flat to domed frontoparietal, the broad and flattened bar along the postorbital and squamosal bones, and the squamosal bones being deep plates on the occiput. In 1986, Sereno had divided the pachycephalosaurs into different groups based on the extent of the doming of their skulls (grouped in now invalid taxa such as "Tholocephalidae" and "Domocephalinae"), and in 2000 he considered the "partially" domed "Stegoceras" a transition between the supposedly "primitive" flat-headed and advanced "fully" domed genera (such as "Pachycephalosaurus"). The dome-headed/flat-headed division of the pachycephalosaurs was abandoned in the following years, as flat heads were considered <a href="paedomorphic">paedomorphic</a> (juvenile-like) or derived traits in most revisions, but not a sexually <a href="Dimorphic%20sexual%20behavior">dimorphic</a> trait. In 2006, Sullivan argued against the idea that the extent of doming was useful in determining taxonomic affinities between pachycephalosaurs. In 2003, Sullivan found "Stegoceras" itself to be more <a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> (or "primitive") than the "fully-domed" members of the subfamily Pachycephalosaurinae, elaborating on conclusions reached by Sereno in 1986.

A 2013 <a href="phylogenetic%20analysis">phylogenetic analysis</a> by Evans and colleagues found that some flat-headed pachycephalosaur genera were more closely related to "fully" domed taxa than to the "incompletely" domed "Stegoceras", which suggests they represent juveniles of domed taxa, and that flat heads do not indicate taxonomic affinities. The <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> below shows the placement of "Stegoceras" within Pachycephalocauridae according to Schott et al., 2016:
The <a href="biogeography">biogeography</a> and early evolutionary history of pachycephalosaurs is poorly understood, and can only be clarified by new discoveries. Pachycephalosaurs appear abruptly in the fossil record, and are present in both North America and Asia, so it is unknown when they first originated, and from which direction they dispersed. The oldest known members of the group (such as "<a href="Acrotholus">Acrotholus</a>") are "fully domed" and known from the <a href="Santonian">Santonian</a> stage of the Late Cretaceous period (about 84 million years ago). This is before the supposedly more primitive "Stegoceras" from the <a href="Middle%20Campanian">Middle Campanian</a> (77 million years ago) and "Homalocephale" from the <a href="Early%20Maastrichtian">Early Maastrichtian</a> (70 million years ago), so the doming of the skull may be a homoplastic trait (a form of <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent evolution</a>). The late occurrence of pachycephalosaurs compared to the related ceratopsians indicates a long <a href="ghost%20lineage">ghost lineage</a> (inferred, but missing from the fossil record) spanning 66 million years, from the <a href="Late%20Jurassic">Late Jurassic</a> to the Cretaceous. Since pachycephalosaurs were mainly small, this may be due to <a href="taphonomic%20bias">taphonomic bias</a>; smaller animals are less likely to be preserved through fossilisation. More delicate bones are also less likely to be preserved, which is why pachycephalosaurs are mainly known from their robust skulls.

It is not entirely certain what pachycephalosaurs ate; having very small, ridged teeth they could not have chewed tough, fibrous plants as effectively as other dinosaurs of the same period. It is assumed that their sharp, serrated teeth were ideally suited for a mixed diet of leaves, seeds, fruit and insects. "Stegoceras" may have had an entirely herbivorous diet, as the tooth crowns were similar to those of <a href="iguanid">iguanid</a> lizards. The premaxillary teeth show wear facets from contact with the predentary bone, and the maxillary teeth have double wear facets similar to those seen in other ornithischian dinosaurs. Every third maxillary tooth of UALVP 2 are erupting <a href="replacement%20teeth">replacement teeth</a>, and tooth replacement happened in backwards progression in sequential threes. The occipital region of "Stegoceras" was well-demarcated for muscle-attachment and it is believed that the jaw movement of "Stegoceras" and other pachycephalosaurs was mostly limited to up-and-down motions with only a slight capability for jaw rotation. This is based on the structure of the jaw and dental microwear and wear facets of the teeth indicate that the bite-force was used more for shearing than for crushing.

Several explanations have historically been proposed for the variation seen in the skulls of "Stegoceras" and other pachycephalosaurs. Brown and Schlaikjer suggested that there was <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> in the degree of doming, and hypothesized that flat-headed specimens such as AMNH 5450 ("Ornatotholus") represented the female morph of "Stegoceras". This idea was supported by a 1981 <a href="morphometric">morphometric</a> study by Champan and colleagues, which found that males had larger and thicker domes. After other flat-headed pachycephalosaurs were discovered, the degree of doming was proposed to be a feature with taxonomic importance, and AMNH 5450 was therefore considered a distinct taxon from 1979 onwards. In 1998, Goodwin and colleagues instead proposed that the inflation of the dome was an ontogenetic feature that changed with age, based on a <a href="histological">histological</a> study of an "S. validum" skull that showed the dome consisted of vascular, fast-growing bone, consistent with an increase in doming through age. These authors found that the supposedly distinct features of "Ornatotholus" could easily be the results of ontogeny.

In 2003, Williamson and Carr published a hypothetical growth series of "S. validum", showing "Ornatotholus" as the juvenile stage. They suggested that juveniles were characterized by a flat, thickened frontoparietal roof, with larger supratemporal fenestrae, and studded with closely spaced tubercles and nodes. The parietosquamosal shelf was not reduced in size, and the frontoparietal suture was open. Sub-adults had mound-like domes, with the back part of the parietal and skull-roof being flat. The supratemporal fenestrae showed asymmetry in size, and the closure of the frontoparietal suture was variable. The nodes were stretched or almost obliterated as the dome expanded during growth, with a tesserated surface remaining. The pattern was often obliterated at the highest point (apex) of the dome, the area where maximum expansion occurred. The tubercles on the skull were stretched in different directions, and those at the margin of the parietosquamosal shelf may have been <a href="Hypertrophy">hypertrophied</a> (enlarged) tubercles. The back and sides of sub-adult and adult skulls were ornamented by less modified tubercles. Before being incorporated into the enlarging dome, the skull bones expanded, resulting in junctions between these bones. The adult dome was broad and convex, and incorporated most of the shelf, which was reduced in size and overhung the occiput as a thick "lip". The supratempooral fenestrae were closed, but the suture between the frontoparietal and connected skull bones was not always closed in adults and subadults.

In 2011, Ryan Schott and colleagues made a more comprehensive analysis of cranial dome ontogeny in "S. validum". The study found that the parietosquamosal shelf conserved the arrangement of ornamentation throughout growth, and that vascularity of the frontoparietal domes decreased with size. It also found that dome shape and size was strongly correlated with growth, and that growth was <a href="allometric">allometric</a> (in contrast to <a href="Isometry">isometric</a>) from flat to domed, supporting "Ornatotholus" as a juvenile "Stegoceras". They also hypothesized that this model of dome growth, with dramatic changes from juvenile to adult, was the common developmental trajectory of pachycephalosaurs. These researchers noted that though Williamson and Carr's observation that the supratemporal fenestrae closed with age was generally correct, there was still a high degree of individual variation in the size of these fenestrae, regardless of the size of the frontoparietal, and this feature may therefore have been independent of ontogeny.

A 2012 study by Schott and David C. Evans found that the number and shape of the individual nodes on the squamosal shelf of the examined "S. validum" skulls varied considerably, and that this variability does not seem to correlate with ontogenic changes, but was due to individual variation. These researchers found no correlation between the width of supratemporal fenestrae and the size of the squamosal.

The function of pachycephalosaur domes has been debated, and "Stegoceras" has been used as a model for experimentation in various studies. The dome has mainly been interpreted as a weapon used in <a href="intra-specific%20combat">intra-specific combat</a>, a <a href="sexual%20display">sexual display</a> structure, or a means for <a href="species%20recognition">species recognition</a>. The hypothesis that the domed skulls of "Stegoceras" and other pachycephalosaurs were used for butting heads was first suggested by American palaeontologist <a href="Edwin%20Colbert">Edwin Colbert</a> in 1955. In 1970 and 1971, Galton elaborated on this idea, and argued that if the dome was simply ornamental, it would have been less dense, and that the structure was ideal for resisting force. Galton suggested that when "Stegoceras" held its skull vertically, perpendicular to the neck, force would be transmitted from the skull, with little chance of it being dislocated, and the dome could therefore be used as a battering-ram. He believed it was unlikely to have been used mainly as defence against predators, because the dome itself lacked spikes, and those of the parietosquamosal shelf were in an "ineffective" position, but found it compatible with intra-specific competition. Galton imagined the domes were bashed together, while the vertebral column was held in a horizontal position. This could either be done while facing each other while dealing blows, or while charging each other with lowered heads (analogous to modern sheep and goats). He also noted that the rigidity of the back would have been useful when using the head for this purpose. In 1978, Sues agreed with Galton that the anatomy of pachycephalosaurs was consistent with transmitting dome-to-dome impact stress, based on tests with <a href="plexi-glass">plexi-glass</a> models. The impact would be absorbed through the neck and body, and neck ligaments and muscles would prevent injuries by glancing blows (as in modern <a href="bighorn%20sheep">bighorn sheep</a>). Sues also suggested that the animals could have butted each other's flanks.

In 1997, the American palaeontologist <a href="Kenneth%20Carpenter">Kenneth Carpenter</a> pointed out that the dorsal vertebrae from the back of the pachycephalosaur "Homalocephale" show that the back curved downwards just before the neck (which was not preserved), and unless the neck curved upwards, the head would point to the ground. He therefore inferred that the necks of "Stegoceras" and other pachycephalosaurs were held in a curved posture (as is the norm in dinosaurs), and that they would therefore not have been able to align their head, neck, and body horizontally straight, which would be needed to transmit stress. Their necks would have to be held below the level of the back, which would have risked damaging the spinal cord on impact. Modern bighorn sheep and <a href="bison">bison</a> overcome this problem by having strong ligaments from the neck to the tall neural spines over the shoulders (which absorb the force of impact), but such features are not known in pachycephalosaurs. These animals also absorb the force of impact through sinus chambers at the base of their horns, and their foreheads and horns form a broad contact surface, unlike the narrow surface of pachycephalosaur domes. Because the dome of "Stegoceras" was rounded, it would have given a very small area for potential impact, and the domes would have glanced off each other (unless the impact was perfectly centred). Combating pachycephalosaurs would have had difficulty seeing each other while their heads were lowered, due to the bony ridges above the eyes.

Because of the problems he found with the head-butting hypothesis, Carpenter instead suggested the domes were adaptations for flank-butting (as seen in some large African mammals); he imagined that two animals would stand parallel, facing each other or the same direction, and direct blows to the side of the opponent. The relatively large body width of pachycephalosaurs may consequently have served to protect vital organs from harm during flank-butting. It is possible that "Stegoceras" and similar pachycephalosaurs would have delivered the blows with a movement of the neck from the side and a rotation of the head. The upper sides of the dome have the greatest surface area, and may have been the point of impact. The thickness of the dome would have increased the power behind a blow to the sides, and this would ensure that the opponent felt the force of the impact, without being seriously injured. The bone rim above the orbit may have protected the aggressor's eye when making a blow. Carpenter suggested that the pachycephalosaurs would have first engaged in <a href="threat%20display">threat display</a> by bobbing and presenting their heads to show the size of their domes (intimidation), and thereafter delivered blows to each other, until one opponent signalled submission.

In 1987, J. K. Rigby and colleagues suggested that pachycephalosaur domes were <a href="heat-exchange">heat-exchange</a> organs used for <a href="thermoregulation">thermoregulation</a>, based on their internal "radiating structures" (<a href="trabeculae">trabeculae</a>). This idea was supported by a few other writers in the mid-1990s. In 1998, Goodwin and colleagues considered the lack of sinuses in the skull of "Stegoceras" and the "<a href="honeycomb">honeycomb</a>"-like network of vascular bone in the dome ill-suited for head-butting, and pointed out that the bones adjacent to the dome risked fracture during such contact. Building on the idea that the ossified tendons that stiffened the tails of "Stegoceras" and other pachycephalosaurs enabled them to take a tripodal stance (first suggested by Maryańska and Osmólska in 1974), Goodwin et al. suggested these structures could have protected the tail against flank-butting, or that the tail itself could have been used as a weapon. In 2004, Goodwin and colleagues studied the cranial histology of pachycephalosaurs, and found that the vascularity (including the trabeculae) of the domes decreased with age, which they found inconsistent with a function in either head-butting or heat-exchange. They also suggested that a dense layer of <a href="Sharpey%27s%20fibers">Sharpey's fibers</a> near the surface of the dome indicated that it had an external covering in life, which makes it impossible to know the shape of the dome in a living animal. These researchers instead concluded that the domes were mainly for species recognition and communication (as in some African <a href="bovids">bovids</a>) and that use in sexual display was only secondary. They further speculated that the external covering of the domes was brightly coloured in life, or may have changed colour seasonally.

In 2008, Eric Snively and Adam Cox tested the performance of 2D and 3D pachycephalosaur skulls through <a href="finite%20element%20analysis">finite element analysis</a>, and found that they could withstand considerable impact; greater vaulting of the domes allowed for higher forces of impact. They also considered it likely that pachycephalosaur domes were covered in <a href="keratin">keratin</a>, a strong material that can withstand much energy without being permanently damaged (like the <a href="osteoderms">osteoderms</a> of <a href="crocodilians">crocodilians</a>), and therefore incorporated keratin into their test formula. In 2011, American palaeontologists <a href="Kevin%20Padian">Kevin Padian</a> and <a href="John%20R.%20Horner">John R. Horner</a> proposed that "bizarre structures" in dinosaurs in general (including domes, frills, horns, and crests) were primarily used for species recognition, and dismissed other explanations as unsupported by evidence. Among other studies, these authors cited Goodwin et al.'s 2004 paper on pachycephalosaur domes as support of this idea, and they pointed out that such structures did not appear to be sexually dimorphic. In a response to Padian and Horner the same year, Rob J. Knell and <a href="Scott%20D.%20Sampson">Scott D. Sampson</a> argued that species recognition was not unlikely as a secondary function for "bizarre structures" in dinosaurs, but that <a href="sexual%20selection">sexual selection</a> (used in display or combat to compete for mates) was a more likely explanation, due to the high cost of developing them, and because such structures appear to be highly variable within species. In 2013, the British palaeontologists David E. Hone and <a href="Darren%20Naish">Darren Naish</a> criticized the "species recognition hypothesis", and argued that no extant animals use such structures primarily for species recognition, and that Padian and Horner had ignored the possibility of mutual sexual selection (where both sexes are ornamented).

In 2011, Snively and Jessica M. Theodor conducted a finite element analysis by simulating head-impacts with <a href="CT%20scanned">CT scanned</a> skulls of "S. validum" (UALVP 2), "Prenocephale prenes" and several extant head-butting <a href="artiodactyls">artiodactyls</a>. They found that the correlations between head-striking and skull morphologies found in the living animals also existed in the studied pachycephalosaurs. "Stegoceras" and "Prenocephale" both had skull shapes similar to the bighorn sheep with <a href="cancellous%20bone">cancellous bone</a> protecting the brain. They also shared similarities in the distribution of compact and cancellous regions with the bighorn sheep, <a href="white-bellied%20duiker">white-bellied duiker</a> and the <a href="giraffe">giraffe</a>. The white-bellied duiker was found to be the closest morphological analogue to "Stegoceras"; this head-butting species has a dome which is smaller but similarly rounded. "Stegoceras" was better capable of dissipating force than artiodactyls that butt heads at high forces, but the less vascularized domes of older pachycephalosaurs, and possibly diminished ability to heal from injuries, argued against such combat in older individuals. The study also tested the effects of a keratinous covering of the dome, and found it to aid in performance. Though "Stegoceras" lacked the <a href="pneumatic">pneumatic</a> sinuses that are found below the point of impact in the skulls of head-striking artiodactyls, it instead had vascular struts which could have similarly acted as braces, as well as conduits to feed the development of a keratin covering.

In 2012, Schott and Evans suggested that the regularity in squamosal ornamentation throughout the ontogeny of "Stegoceras" was consistent with species recognition, but the change from flat to domed frontoparietals in late age suggests that the function of this feature changed through ontogeny, and was perhaps sexually selected, possibly for intra-specific combat. In 2012, Caleb M. Brown and Anthony P. Russell suggested that the stiffened tails were probably not used as defence against flank-butting, but may have enabled the animals to take a tripodal stance during intra-specific combat, with the tail as support. Brown and Russell found that the tail could thereby help in resisting compressive, tensile, and torsional loading when the animal delivered or received blows with the dome.

A 2013 study by Joseph E. Peterson and colleagues identified lesions in skulls of "Stegoceras" and other pachycephalosaurs, which were interpreted as infections caused by trauma. Lesions were found on 22% of sampled pachycephalosaur skulls (a frequency consistent across genera), but were absent from flat-headed specimens (which have been interpreted as juveniles or females), which is consistent with use in intra-specific combat (for territory or mates). The distribution of lesions in these animals tended to concentrate at the top of the dome, which supports head-butting behaviour. Flank-butting would probably result in fewer injuries, which would instead be concentrated on the sides of the dome. These observations were made while comparing the lesions with those on the skulls and flanks of modern sheep skeletons. The researchers noted that modern head-butting animals use their weapons for both combat and display, and that pachycephalosaurs could therefore also have used their domes for both. Displaying a weapon and willingness to use it can be enough to settle disputes in some animals.

In 1989, Emily B. Griffin found that "Stegoceras" and other pachycephalosaurs had a good sense of smell (olfaction), based on the study of cranial <a href="endocasts">endocasts</a> that showed large <a href="olfactory%20bulbs">olfactory bulbs</a> in the brain. In 2014, Jason M. Bourke and colleagues found that "Stegoceras" would have needed cartilaginous <a href="nasal%20concha">nasal turbinates</a> in the front of the nasal passages for airflow to reach the olfactory region. Evidence for the presence of this structure is a bony ridge to which it could have attached. The size of the olfactory region also indicates that "Stegoceras" had a keen sense of smell. The researchers found that the dinosaur could have had either a scroll-shaped turbinate (like in a <a href="Turkey%20%28bird%29">turkey</a>) or a branched one (as in an <a href="ostrich">ostrich</a>) as both could have directed air to the olfactory region. The blood vessel system in the passages also suggest that the turbinates served to cool down warm arterial blood from the body that was heading to the brain. The skull of "S. validum" specimen UALVP 2 was suited for a study of this kind due to its exceptional preservation; it has ossified soft tissue in the nasal cavity, which would otherwise be <a href="cartilaginous">cartilaginous</a> and therefore not preserved through mineralization.

"S. validum" is known from the late <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> Belly River Group (the Canadian equivalent to the <a href="Judith%20River%20Group">Judith River Group</a> in the US), and specimens have been recovered from the <a href="Dinosaur%20Park%20Formation">Dinosaur Park Formation</a> (late Campanian, 76.5 to 75 mya) in <a href="Dinosaur%20Provincial%20Park">Dinosaur Provincial Park</a> (including the lectotype specimen), and the <a href="Oldman%20Formation">Oldman Formation</a> (middle Campanian, 77.5 to 76.5 mya) of Alberta, Canada. The pachycephalosaurs "Hanssuesia" and "Foraminacephale" are also known from both formations. "S. novomexicanum" is known from the <a href="Fruitland%20Formation">Fruitland</a> (late Campanian, about 75 mya) and lower <a href="Kirtland%20Formation">Kirtland Formation</a> (late <a href="Campanian">Campanian</a>, about 74 mya) of New Mexico, and if this species correctly belongs in "Stegoceras", the genus would have had a broad geographic distribution. The presence of similar pachycephalosaurs in both the west and north of North America during the latest Cretaceous shows that they were an important part of the dinosaur faunas there. It has traditionally been suggested that pachycehalosaurs inhabited mountain environments; wear of their skulls was supposedly a result of them having been rolled by water from upland areas, and comparisons with bighorn sheep reinforced the theory. In 2014, Jordan C. Mallon and Evans disputed this idea, as the wear and original locations of the skulls is not consistent with having been transported in such a way, and they instead proposed that North American pachycephalosaurs inhabited <a href="alluvial">alluvial</a> (associated with water) and <a href="coastal%20plain">coastal plain</a> environments.

The Dinosaur Park Formation is interpreted as a low-relief setting of <a href="river">river</a>s and <a href="floodplain">floodplain</a>s that became more <a href="swamp">swamp</a>y and influenced by <a href="ocean">marine</a> conditions over time as the <a href="Western%20Interior%20Seaway">Western Interior Seaway</a> <a href="transgression%20%28geology%29">transgressed</a> westward. The <a href="climate">climate</a> was warmer than present-day Alberta, without <a href="frost">frost</a>, but with wetter and drier seasons. <a href="Conifer">Conifer</a>s were apparently the dominant <a href="forest%20canopy">canopy</a> plants, with an <a href="understory">understory</a> of <a href="fern">fern</a>s, <a href="tree%20fern">tree fern</a>s, and <a href="angiosperm">angiosperm</a>s. Dinosaur Park is known for its diverse community of herbivores. As well as "Stegoceras", the formation has also yielded fossils of the ceratopsians "<a href="Centrosaurus">Centrosaurus</a>", "<a href="Styracosaurus">Styracosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Chasmosaurus">Chasmosaurus</a>", the <a href="hadrosaurid">hadrosaurid</a>s "<a href="Prosaurolophus">Prosaurolophus</a>", "<a href="Lambeosaurus">Lambeosaurus</a>", "<a href="Gryposaurus">Gryposaurus</a>", "<a href="Corythosaurus">Corythosaurus</a>", and "<a href="Parasaurolophus">Parasaurolophus</a>", and the <a href="ankylosaur">ankylosaur</a>s "<a href="Edmontonia">Edmontonia</a>" and "<a href="Euoplocephalus">Euoplocephalus</a>". Theropods present include the <a href="tyrannosaurid">tyrannosaurid</a>s "<a href="Gorgosaurus">Gorgosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Daspletosaurus">Daspletosaurus</a>".

Psittacosaurus

Psittacosaurus ( ; "<a href="parrot">parrot</a> <a href="lizard">lizard</a>") is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="extinct">extinct</a> <a href="ceratopsia">ceratopsia</a>n <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> from the Early <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> of what is now <a href="Asia">Asia</a>, existing between 126 and 101 <a href="million%20years%20ago">million years ago</a>. It is notable for being the most <a href="species">species</a>-rich dinosaur genus. Up to 11 species are known, from across <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>, <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>, <a href="China">China</a>, and possibly <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>. The species of "Psittacosaurus" were obligate <a href="bipeds">bipeds</a> at adulthood, with a high skull and a robust beak. One individual was found preserved with long filaments on the tail, similar to those of "<a href="Tianyulong">Tianyulong</a>", and scales across the rest of the animal. "Psittacosaurus" probably had complex behaviours, based on the proportions and relative size of the brain. It may have been active for short periods of time during the day and night, and had well-developed senses of smell and vision.

"Psittacosaurus" was one of the earliest ceratopsians, but closer to "<a href="Triceratops">Triceratops</a>" than "<a href="Yinlong">Yinlong</a>". Once in its own family, Psittacosauridae, with other genera like "Hongshanosaurus", it is now considered to be <a href="senior%20synonym">senior synonym</a> of the latter and an early offshoot of the branch that led to more <a href="derived%20trait">derived</a> forms. The genera closely related to "Psittacosaurus" are all from Asia, with the exception of "<a href="Aquilops">Aquilops</a>", from <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. The first species was either "P. lujiatunensis" or closely related, and it may have given rise to later forms of "Psittacosaurus".

"Psittacosaurus" is one of the most completely known dinosaur genera. Fossils of hundreds of individuals have been collected so far, including many complete skeletons. Most age classes are represented, from <a href="hatchling">hatchling</a> through to adult, which has allowed several detailed studies of "Psittacosaurus" growth rates and <a href="reproductive">reproductive</a> <a href="biology">biology</a>. The abundance of this dinosaur in the <a href="fossil%20record">fossil record</a> has led to the labelling of Lower Cretaceous sediments of <a href="east%20Asia">east Asia</a> the "Psittacosaurus" <a href="biochron">biochron</a>.

The species of "Psittacosaurus" vary in size and specific features of the <a href="skull">skull</a> and skeleton, but share the same overall body shape. The best-known—"P. mongoliensis"—can reach 2 metres (6.5 ft) in length. The maximum adult body weight was most likely over 20 <a href="kilogramme">kilogramme</a>s (44 lb) in "P. mongoliensis". Several species approach "P. mongoliensis" in size ("P. lujiatunensis", "P. neimongoliensis", "P. xinjiangensis"), while others are somewhat smaller ("P. sinensis", "P. meileyingensis"). The smallest known species, "P. ordosensis", is 30% smaller than "P. mongoliensis". The largest are "P. lujiatunensis" and "P. sibiricus", although neither is significantly larger than "P. mongoliensis". "Psittacosaurus" postcranial skeletons are more typical of a 'generic' bipedal ornithischian. There are only four digits on the <a href="Manus%20%28zoology%29">manus</a> ('hand'), as opposed to the five found in most other ornithischians (including all other ceratopsians), while the four-toed hindfoot is very similar to many other small ornithischians.

The skull of "Psittacosaurus" is highly modified compared to other <a href="ornithischia">ornithischia</a>n dinosaurs of its time. Extremely tall in height and short in length, the skull has an almost round <a href="wikt%3Aprofile">profile</a> in some species. The portion in front of the <a href="orbit%20%28anatomy%29">orbit</a> (eye socket) is only 40% of total skull length, shorter than any other known ornithischian. The lower jaws of psittacosaurs are characterised by a bulbous vertical ridge down the centre of each tooth. Both upper and lower jaws sport a pronounced beak, formed from the "rostral" and "predentary" bones, respectively. The bony core of the beak may have been sheathed in <a href="keratin">keratin</a> to provide a sharp cutting surface for cropping <a href="plant">plant</a> material. As the generic name suggests, the short skull and beak superficially resemble those of modern parrots. "Psittacosaurus" skulls share several adaptations with more <a href="Synapomorphy">derived</a> ceratopsians, such as the unique rostral bone at the tip of the upper jaw, and the flared <a href="jugal">jugal</a> (cheek) bones. There is still no sign of the bony neck frill or prominent facial horns which would develop in later ceratopsians. Bony horns protrude from the skull of "P. sibiricus", but these are thought to be an example of <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent evolution</a>.

The <a href="integument">integument</a>, or body covering, of "Psittacosaurus" is known from a Chinese specimen, which most likely comes from the <a href="Yixian%20Formation">Yixian Formation</a> of <a href="Liaoning%20Province">Liaoning Province</a>, China. The specimen, which is not yet assigned to any particular species, was illegally exported from China, in violation of Chinese law, but was purchased by the <a href="Senckenberg%20Museum">Senckenberg Museum</a> in <a href="Germany">Germany</a>. It was described while awaiting repatriation.

Most of the body was covered in <a href="Scale%20%28zoology%29">scales</a>. Larger scales were arranged in irregular patterns, with numerous smaller scales occupying the spaces between them, similarly to skin impressions known from other ceratopsians, such as "<a href="Chasmosaurus">Chasmosaurus</a>". A series of what appear to be hollow, tubular bristle-like structures, approximately long, were also preserved, arranged in a row down the <a href="Dorsum%20%28biology%29">dorsal</a> (upper) surface of the tail. These were confirmed by the authors, as well as an independent scientist, to not represent plant material. The bristle-like integumentary structures extend into the skin nearly to the vertebrae, and were likely circular or tubular before being preserved. Under <a href="ultraviolet%20light">ultraviolet light</a>, they gave off the same fluorescence as scales, providing the possibility they were <a href="keratin">keratin</a>ized. The study stated that, "at present, there is no convincing evidence which shows these structures to be <a href="homology%20%28biology%29">homologous</a> to the structurally different integumentary filaments of <a href="theropod">theropod</a> dinosaurs". However, they found that all other feather-like integument from the Yixian Formation could be identified as feathers.

In 2008, another study was published describing the integument and <a href="dermis">dermis</a> of "Psittacosaurus" sp., from two different specimens. The skin remains could be observed by a natural cross-section to compare them to modern animals, showing that dinosaurian dermal layers evolved in parallel to those in many other large vertebrates. The <a href="collagen">collagen</a> tissue fibres in "Psittacosaurus" are complex, virtually identical to all other vertebrates in structure but having an exceptional thickness of about forty layers. As the sections of dermis were collected from the abdomen, where the scales were eroded, the tissue may have assisted with the musculature of the stomach and intestines and offered protection against predators.
As described in a 2016 study, examination of melanosomes preserved in the specimen of "Psittacosaurus" preserved with integument indicated that the animal was <a href="countershading">countershaded</a>, likely due to preferring a habitat in dense forests with little light, much like many modern species of forest-dwelling deer and antelope; stripes and spots on the limbs may represent <a href="disruptive%20coloration">disruptive coloration</a>. The specimen also had dense clusters of pigment on its shoulders, face (possibly for display), and cloaca (which may have had an antimicrobial function), as well as large <a href="patagium">patagia</a> on its hind legs that connected to the base of the tail. Its large eyes indicate that it also likely had good vision, which would have been useful in finding food or avoiding predators. The authors pointed out that there might have been variation in coloration across the range of the animal, depending on differences in the light environment. The authors were unable to determine which species of <a href="Jehol%20Biota">Jehol Formation</a> "Psittacosaurus" the specimen belonged to due to the way the skull is preserved, but ruled out "P. mongoliensis", based on hip features.

Another 2016 study used <a href="laser-induced%20fluorescence">laser-stimulated fluorescence imaging</a> to analyze the internal structure of the bristles. The highly cornified bristles are arranged in tight clusters of three to six individual bristles, with each bristle being filled with pulp. The authors considered the bristles as being homologous to the quills of "<a href="Tianyulong">Tianyulong</a>", the elongated broad filamentous feathers (EBFFs) of "<a href="Beipiaosaurus">Beipiaosaurus</a>", and possibly the feathers of birds as well. Similar bristles are found in extant birds such as the <a href="horned%20screamer">horned screamer</a>; these structures differ from feathers in that they do not develop from a <a href="follicle%20%28anatomy%29">follicle</a>, but both arise from discrete cell populations. A darkened soft-tissue structure was also found near the jugal horn; this may represent a keratinous sheath or a skin flap.

Skulls of "P. mongoliensis" are flat on top, especially over the back of the skull, with a triangular depression, the <a href="antorbital%20fenestra">antorbital fossa</a>, on the outside surface of the <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a> (an upper jaw bone). A flange is present on the lower edge of the <a href="dentary">dentary</a> (the tooth-bearing bone of the lower jaw), although it is not as prominent as in "P. meileyingensis" or "P. major" (="P. lujiatunensis"). "P. mongoliensis" is among the largest known species. The skull of the type specimen, which is probably a juvenile, is 15.2 centimetres (6 in) long, and the associated <a href="femur">femur</a> is 16.2 centimetres (6.4 in) in length. Other specimens are larger, with the largest documented femur measuring about 21 centimetres (8.25 in) long.

"P. sinensis" is readily distinguished from all other species by numerous features of the skull. Adult skulls are smaller than those of "P. mongoliensis" and have less teeth. Uniquely, the <a href="premaxilla">premaxilla</a>ry bone contacts the <a href="jugal">jugal</a> (cheek) bone on the outside of the skull. The jugals flare out sideways, forming '<a href="horn%20%28anatomy%29">horns</a>' proportionally wider than in any other known "Psittacosaurus" species except "P. sibiricus" and "P. lujiatunensis". Because of the flared cheeks, the skull is actually wider than it is long. A smaller 'horn' is present behind the <a href="eye">eye</a>, at the contact of the jugal and <a href="postorbital">postorbital</a> bones, a feature also seen in "P. sibiricus". The <a href="mandible">mandible</a> (lower jaw) lacks the hollow opening, or "<a href="Fenestra%20%28anatomy%29">fenestra</a>", seen in other species, and the entire lower jaw is bowed outwards, giving the animal the appearance of an <a href="underbite">underbite</a>. The skull of an adult "P. sinensis" can reach 11.5 centimeters (4.5 in) in length.

"P. sibiricus" is the largest-known species of "Psittacosaurus". The skull of the type specimen is 20.7 centimetres long (8.25 in), and the femur is 22.3 cm (8.75 in) in length. It is also distinguished by its <a href="neck%20frill">neck frill</a>, which is longer than any other species, at 15 to 18% of skull length. A very striking feature of "P. sibiricus" is the number of 'horns' around the eyes, with three prominences on each postorbital, and one in front of each eye, on the <a href="palpebral%20%28bone%29">palpebral</a> bones. Similar horns found on the postorbital of "P. sinensis" are not as pronounced but may be <a href="homology%20%28biology%29">homologous</a>. The jugal has extremely prominent 'horns' and may contact the premaxilla, both features also seen in the possibly related "P. sinensis". There is a flange on the dentary of the lower jaw, similar to "P. mongoliensis", "P. meileyingensis", and "P. sattayaraki". It can be told apart from the other species of "Psittacosaurus" by a combination of 32 anatomical features, including six that are unique to the species. Most of these are skull details, but one unusual feature is the presence of 23 vertebrae between the skull and pelvis, unlike the 21 or 22 in the other species where the vertebrae are known.

"P. xinjiangensis" is distinguished by a prominent jugal 'horn' that is flattened on the front end, as well as some features of the teeth. The <a href="ilium%20%28bone%29">ilium</a>, one of the three bones of the pelvis, also bears a characteristically long bony process behind the <a href="acetabulum">acetabulum</a> (hip socket). An adult femur has a published length of about 16 centimetres (6.3 in). "P. meileyingensis" has the shortest snout and <a href="neck%20frill">neck frill</a> of any species, making the skull nearly circular in profile. The <a href="orbit%20%28anatomy%29">orbit</a> (eye socket) is roughly triangular, and there is a prominent flange on the lower edge of the dentary, a feature also seen in specimens of "P. lujiatunensis", and to a lesser degree in "P. mongoliensis", "P. sattayaraki", and "P. sibiricus". The complete type skull, probably adult, is 13.7 centimetres (5.5 in) long. The dentary of "P. sattayaraki" has a flange similar to that found in "P. mongoliensis", "P. sibiricus", "P. lujiatunensis" and "P. meileyingensis", although it is less pronounced than in those species. The material appears to be roughly the same size as "P. sinensis". The <a href="frontal%20bone%23In%20dinosaurs">frontal bone</a> of "P. neimongoliensis" is distinctly narrow compared to that of other species, resulting in a narrower skull overall. The <a href="ischium">ischium</a> bone of the pelvis is also longer than the <a href="femur">femur</a>, which differs from other species in which these bones are known. The type specimen has a skull length of 13.2 centimetres (5.2 in) and a femoral length of 13 centimetres (5.1 in), but is not fully grown. An adult "P. neimongoliensis" was probably smaller than "P. mongoliensis", with a proportionately longer skull and tail. "P. ordosensis" can be distinguished by numerous features of the jugals, which have very prominent 'horns'. It is also the smallest known species. One adult skull measures only 9.5 centimeters (3.75 in) in length.

The type skull of "P. lujiatunensis" measures 19 cm (7.5 in) in length, while the largest-known skull is 20.5 centimetres (8 in) long, so this species was similar in size to "P. mongoliensis" and "P. sibiricus". There is a fossa in front of the eye, as in "P. mongoliensis". The jugal bones flare outwards widely, making the skull wider than it is long, as seen in "P. sinensis". Widely flared jugals are also found in "P. sibiricus". Overall, this species is thought to exhibit several primitive characteristics compared to other species of "Psittacosaurus", which is consistent with its greater geological age. "P. gobiensis" was small-bodied ( long) and differs from other species of "Psittacosaurus" by "significant, but structurally minor, details." These include the presence of a pyramidal horn on the <a href="postorbital">postorbital</a>, a depression on the postorbital-jugal contact, and enamel thickness. "P. mongoliensis" was a contemporary.

"Psittacosaurus" was first described as a genus in 1923, by <a href="Henry%20Fairfield%20Osborn">Henry Fairfield Osborn</a>. He named the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> "P. mongoliensis", for the location of its discovery in <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>, placing it in the new family Psittacosauridae. Remains of this dinosaur were first discovered the year before, on the third <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a> expedition to the <a href="Gobi%20Desert">Gobi Desert</a> of Mongolia, when one of the expedition's drivers, Wong, found the <a href="type%20specimen">type specimen</a> (AMNH 6254), which preserves a nearly complete skull, as well as a post cranial skeleton lacking sections of the limbs. This same expedition turned up the remains of many other famous Mongolian dinosaurs, including "<a href="Protoceratops">Protoceratops</a>", "<a href="Oviraptor">Oviraptor</a>", and "<a href="Velociraptor">Velociraptor</a>". Many later expeditions by various combinations of Mongolian, Russian, Chinese, American, Polish, Japanese, and Canadian paleontologists also recovered specimens from throughout Mongolia and northern China. In these areas, "Psittacosaurus mongoliensis" fossils are found in most <a href="sedimentary">sedimentary</a> <a href="stratum">strata</a> dating to the <a href="Aptian">Aptian</a> to <a href="Albian">Albian</a> <a href="faunal%20stage">stages</a> of the Early <a href="Cretaceous%20Period">Cretaceous Period</a>, or approximately 125 to 100 mya. Fossil remains of over 75 individuals have been recovered, including nearly 20 complete skeletons with skulls. Individuals of all ages are known, from <a href="hatchling">hatchling</a>s less than long, to very old adults reaching nearly in length.

When describing "Psittacosaurus mongoliensis" in 1923, Osborn also gave the name "Protiguanodon mongoliense" to another skeleton found nearby, believing it to represent an ancestor of the <a href="ornithopod">ornithopod</a> "<a href="Iguanodon">Iguanodon</a>", in the new subfamily Protiguanodontinae. "Protiguanodon mongoliense", AMNH 6523, measured long, and was known from much of the skeleton, although at the time of description the neck vertebrae were still covered by <a href="matrix%20%28geology%29">matrix</a>. Osborn diagnosed his taxa on the basis of features of the teeth and snout. However, modern taxonomists find these features insignificant, instead placing "Protiguanodon mongoliense" within "Psittacosaurus mongoliensis". When the skeleton was prepared further, it became clear that it was nearly identical to "Psittacosaurus mongoliensis". In 1958, Chinese paleontologist <a href="Yang%20Zhongjian">Yang Zhongjian</a> (better known as C. C. Young) renamed the skeleton "Psittacosaurus protiguanodonensis". Today the specimen is generally referred to as the species "Psittacosaurus mongoliensis" and the names "Protiguanodon mongoliense" and "Psittacosaurus protiguanodonensis" are considered <a href="junior%20synonym">junior synonym</a>s of the name "Psittacosaurus mongoliensis", which was coined first.

In 1931, C. C. Young named a new species of "Psittacosaurus" for a partial skull discovered in <a href="Inner%20Mongolia">Inner Mongolia</a>, China. The skull was named "P. osborni" after Henry Fairfield Osborn. The validity of this species is now considered equivocal. Sereno (1990) considered it a synonym of "P. mongoliensis", which is found in nearby strata of the same age. You and Dodson (2004) listed it as valid in a table, but not in their text. In a 2010 review, Sereno again regarded "P. osborni" as a synonym of "P. mongoliensis", but noted it was tentative because of the presence of multiple valid psittacosaur species in Inner Mongolia. Young also described the species "P. tingi" in the same 1931 report which contained "P. osborni". It is based on several skull fragments. He later synonymised the two species under the name "P. osborni". You and Dodson (2004) followed this in a table, but Sereno regarded both species as synonyms of "P. mongoliensis"; a table in the latter reported "P. tingi" as a "<a href="nomen%20dubium">nomen dubium</a>", however. The front half of a skull from <a href="List%20of%20administrative%20divisions%20of%20Inner%20Mongolia">Guyang County</a> in Inner Mongolia was described as "Psittacosaurus guyangensis" in 1983. Disarticulated postcranial remains representing multiple individuals were found at the same locality and were assigned to the species. While it differs from the type specimen of "P. mongoliensis", it falls within the range of individual variation seen in other specimens of that species and is no longer recognised as a valid species. You and Dodson (2004) included "P. guyangensis" in a table of valid taxa, but did not include it as such in their text.

Seventeen species have been referred to the genus "Psittacosaurus", although only nine to eleven are considered valid today. This is the highest number of valid species currently assigned to any single dinosaur genus (not including <a href="bird">bird</a>s). In contrast, most other dinosaur genera are <a href="Monotypic%20taxon">monospecific</a>, containing only a single known species. The difference is most likely due to artifacts of the fossilisation process. While "Psittacosaurus" is known from hundreds of fossil specimens, most other dinosaur species are known from far fewer, and many are represented by only a single specimen. With a very high sample size, the diversity of "Psittacosaurus" can be analysed more completely than that of most dinosaur genera, resulting in the recognition of more species. Most <a href="Extant%20taxon">extant</a> animal genera are represented by multiple species, suggesting that this may have been the case for extinct dinosaur genera as well, although most of these species may not have been preserved. In addition, most dinosaurs are known solely from <a href="bone">bone</a>s and can only be evaluated from a <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> standpoint, whereas extant species often have very similar skeletal morphology but differ in other ways which would not normally be preserved in the fossil record, such as behaviour, or colouration. Therefore, actual species diversity may be much higher than currently recognised in this and other dinosaur genera. As some species are known only from skull material, species of "Psittacosaurus" are primarily distinguished by features of the skull and teeth. Several species can be recognised by features of the <a href="pelvis">pelvis</a> as well.

In the 1950s, a new Chinese species of "Psittacosaurus" was found in the Aptian-Albian <a href="Qingshan%20Formation">Qingshan Formation</a> of <a href="Shandong">Shandong Province</a>, southeast of <a href="Beijing">Beijing</a>. C. C. Young called it "P. sinensis" to differentiate it from "P. mongoliensis", which had originally been found in Mongolia. Fossils of more than twenty individuals have since been recovered, including several complete skulls and skeletons, making this the most well-known species after "P. mongoliensis". Chinese paleontologist <a href="Zhao%20Xijin">Zhao Xijin</a> named a new species after his mentor, C. C. Young, in 1962. However, the type specimen of "P. youngi" (a partial skeleton and skull) was discovered in the same rocks as "P. sinensis" and appears to be very similar, so "P. youngi" is generally considered a junior synonym of that better-known species. As with "P. guyangensis" and "P. osborni", You and Dodson (2004) listed it as valid in a table, but not in their text.

In 1988, Zhao and American paleontologist <a href="Paul%20Sereno">Paul Sereno</a> described "P. xinjiangensis", named after the <a href="Xinjiang">Xinjiang Autonomous Region</a> in which it was discovered. Several individuals of different ages were discovered in the early 1970s by Chinese paleontologists and described by Sereno and Zhao, although the holotype and most complete skeleton belonged to a juvenile. An adult skeleton was later discovered at a different locality in Xinjiang. These specimens come from the upper part of the <a href="Tugulu%20Group">Tugulu Group</a>, which is regarded as Aptian-Albian in age. A second species described in 1988 by Sereno and Zhao, along with two Chinese colleagues, was "P. meileyingensis" from the <a href="Jiufotang%20Formation">Jiufotang Formation</a>, near the town of Meileyingzi, <a href="Liaoning">Liaoning Province</a>, northeastern China. This species is known from four fossil skulls, one associated with some skeletal material, found in 1973 by Chinese scientists. The age of the Jiufotang in Liaoning is unknown, but in the neighbouring province of Inner Mongolia, it has been dated to about 110 Ma, in the Albian stage of the Early Cretaceous.

French paleontologist <a href="Eric%20Buffetaut">Eric Buffetaut</a> and a Thai colleague, <a href="Varavudh%20Suteethorn">Varavudh Suteethorn</a>, described a partial upper and lower jaw from the Aptian-Albian <a href="Khok%20Kruat%20Formation">Khok Kruat Formation</a> of <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a> in 1992, giving it the name "Psittacosaurus sattayaraki". In 2000, Sereno questioned the validity of this species, citing its eroded and fragmentary nature, and noted an absence of features characteristic of the genus "Psittacosaurus". However, in 2002 the original authors published new images of the fossil which seem to show teeth in the lower jaw that exhibit the bulbous vertical ridge characteristic of psittacosaurs. Other authors have also defended its validity, while some continue to regard it as dubious. Sereno (2010) proposed that the best assignment for the type material may be Ceratopsia "<a href="incertae%20sedis">incertae sedis</a>".

Two new species of "Psittacosaurus" were described by Canadian <a href="Dale%20Russell">Dale Russell</a> and Zhao in 1996. The first was named "P. neimongoliensis", after the <a href="Mandarin%20Chinese">Mandarin Chinese</a> name for Inner Mongolia. It is based on a nearly complete fossil skeleton, including most of the skull, found in the Early Cretaceous <a href="Ejinhoro%20Formation">Ejinhoro Formation</a> with seven other individuals. Russell and Zhao also named "P. ordosensis" in 1996, after the <a href="Ordos%20City">Ordos</a> prefecture of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The type specimen is a nearly complete skeleton, including part of the skull. However, only the skull, lower jaw, and foot have been described. Three other specimens were referred to this species but remain undescribed. Like "P. neimongoliensis", this species was discovered in the Eijnhoro Formation. Sereno (2010) found the species as described to be indistinguishable from "P. sinensis", another small species, but suggested that additional study of "P. ordosensis" might reveal diagnostic features. He provisionally designated "P. ordosensis" a "nomen dubium".

<a href="Xu%20Xing%20%28paleontologist%29">Xu Xing</a>, another Chinese paleontologist, named a new species of "Psittacosaurus" in 1997, based on a complete skull with associated <a href="vertebra">vertebra</a>e and a forelimb. This material was recovered in <a href="Gansu%20Province">Gansu Province</a>, near the border with Inner Mongolia. This species is named "P. mazongshanensis" after the nearby mountain called Mazongshan (Horse Mane Mountain) and has been described in a preliminary manner. Unfortunately, the skull was damaged while in the care of the Chinese <a href="Institute%20of%20Vertebrate%20Paleontology%20and%20Paleoanthropology">Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology</a> (IVPP), and several fragments have been lost, including all of the teeth. The remains were found in the <a href="Lower%20Xinminbao%20Formation">Lower Xinminbao Formation</a>, which have not been precisely dated, although there is some evidence that they were deposited in the late <a href="Barremian">Barremian</a> through Aptian stages. Sereno suggested in 2000 that "P. mazongshanensis" was a "nomen dubium", with no unique features that separate it from any other species of "Psittacosaurus". However, more recent authors have noted that it can be distinguished by its proportionally long snout compared to other species of "Psittacosaurus", as well as a prominent bony protuberance, pointing outwards and downwards, on the maxilla of the upper jaw. The maxillary protuberance is also now missing. Other features originally used to distinguish the species have been recognised as the results of the deformation of the skull after fossilisation. Sereno (2010) remained unconvinced of its validity.

Beginning in the 1950s, Russian paleontologists began excavating "Psittacosaurus" remains at a locality near the village of Shestakovo in the <a href="oblast">oblast</a> of <a href="Kemerovo">Kemerovo</a> in <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>. Two other nearby localities were explored in the 1990s, one of which produced several complete skeletons. This species was named "P. sibiricus" in 2000 in a scientific paper written by five Russian paleontologists, but credit for the name is officially given to two of those authors, <a href="Alexei%20Voronkevich">Alexei Voronkevich</a> and <a href="Alexander%20Averianov">Alexander Averianov</a>. The remains were not completely described until 2006. Two nearly complete, articulated skeletons and a variety of disarticulated material from other individuals of all ages are known from the <a href="Ilek%20Formation">Ilek Formation</a> of Siberia, which ranges from the Aptian to Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous.

"P. lujiatunensis", named in 2006 by Chinese paleontologist <a href="Zhou%20Chang-Fu">Zhou Chang-Fu</a> and three Chinese colleagues, is one of the oldest-known species, based on four skulls from the lower beds of Yixian Formation, near the village of Lujiatun. While this bed has been dated differently by different authors, from 128 Ma in the Barremian stage, to 125 Ma in the earliest Aptian, revised dating methods have shown them to be about 123 million years old. "P. lujiatunensis" was contemporaneous with another psittacosaurid species, "Hongshanosaurus houi", which was found in the same beds. It is potentially synonymous with "H. houi"; Sereno (2010), who proposed that "Hongshanosaurus" is a synonym of "Psittacosaurus", opted to leave "P. lujiatunensis" and "H. houi" separate species due to the inadequacies of the latter's type specimen. One nearly complete skeleton of "P. lujiatunensis" from the same lower beds of the Yixian Formation had previously been classified in its own species, "Psittacosaurus major", named for the large size of its skull by Sereno, Zhao and two colleagues in 2007. You and colleagues described an additional specimen and concurred that it was distinct from "P. lujiatunensis". "P. major" was originally characterised by a proportionately large skull, which was 39% of the length of its torso, compared to 30% in "P. mongoliensis", and other features. However, a 2013 study utilising morphometric analysis showed that the supposed differences between "P. lujiatunensis" and "P. major" were due to differences in preservation and crushing. The study concluded that both represented a single species.

A third species of Lujiatun psittacosaur, the first to be named, was described as "Hongshanosaurus houi" in 2003. The generic name "Hongshanosaurus" was derived from the <a href="Mandarin%20Chinese">Mandarin Chinese</a> words 紅 ("hóng": "red") and 山 ("shān": "hill"), as well as the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> word "sauros" ("lizard"). This name refers to the ancient <a href="Hongshan%20culture">Hongshan culture</a> of northeastern <a href="China">China</a>, who lived in the same general area in which the fossil skull of "Hongshanosaurus" was found. The <a href="type%20species">type</a> and only named <a href="species">species</a>, "H. houi", honours <a href="Hou%20Lianhai">Hou Lianhai</a>, a professor at the IVPP in Beijing, who <a href="curator">curated</a> the specimen. Genus and species were both named by Chinese <a href="paleontologist">paleontologist</a>s <a href="You%20Hailu">You Hailu</a>, Xu Xing, and <a href="Wang%20Xiaolin">Wang Xiaolin</a> in 2003. Sereno (2010) regarded its distinct proportions as due to crushing and compression of the "Hongshanosaurus" skulls. He regarded "Hongshanosaurus" as a <a href="Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">junior synonym</a> of "Psittacosaurus", and potentially the same as "P. lujiatunensis". He did not synonymise the two species because of difficulties with the holotype skull of "H. houi", instead considering new combination "P. houi" a "<a href="nomen%20dubium">nomen dubium</a>" within "Psittacosaurus". Sereno's hypothesis was supported by a morphometric study in 2013, which found "P. houi" and "P. lujiatunensis" to be synonymous. While "P. houi" is the oldest available name, the researchers argued that because the type specimen of "P. lujiatunensis" was better preserved, the correct name for this species should be "P. lujiatunensis" rather than "P. houi", which would normally have priority.

"P. gobiensis" is named for the region it was found in 2001, and first described by Sereno, Zhao and Lin in 2010. It is known from a skull and partial articulated skeleton with gastroliths. Many other specimens either cannot be determined to belong to any particular species, or have not yet been assigned to one. These specimens are generally all referred to as "Psittacosaurus" sp., although it is not assumed that they belong to the same species. More than 200 specimens of "Psittacosaurus" have been found in the Yixian Formation, which is famous for its fossils of <a href="feathered%20dinosaur">feathered dinosaur</a>s. The vast majority of these have not been assigned to any published species, although many are very well preserved and some have already been partially described. Nearly 100 "Psittacosaurus" skeletons were excavated in Mongolia during the summers of 2005 and 2006 by a team led by Mongolian paleontologist <a href="Bolortsetseg%20Minjin">Bolortsetseg Minjin</a> and American <a href="Jack%20Horner%20%28paleontologist%29">Jack Horner</a> from the <a href="Museum%20of%20the%20Rockies">Museum of the Rockies</a> in <a href="Montana">Montana</a>. Although only "P. mongoliensis" has been described from Mongolia so far, these specimens are still in preparation and have not yet been assigned to a species.

"Psittacosaurus" is the <a href="type%20genus">type genus</a> of the family Psittacosauridae, which was also named by Osborn in 1923. Psittacosaurids were <a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> to almost all known ceratopsians except "<a href="Yinlong">Yinlong</a>" and perhaps the <a href="Chaoyangsauridae">Chaoyangsauridae</a>. While Psittacosauridae was an early branch of the ceratopsian family tree, "Psittacosaurus" itself was probably not directly ancestral to any other groups of ceratopsians. All other ceratopsians retained the fifth digit of the hand, a <a href="plesiomorphy">plesiomorphy</a> or primitive trait, whereas all species of "Psittacosaurus" had only four digits on the hand. In addition, the "<a href="antorbital%20fenestra">antorbital fenestra</a>", an opening in the skull between the eye socket and <a href="nostril">nostril</a>, was lost during the <a href="evolution">evolution</a> of Psittacosauridae, but is still found in most other ceratopsians and in fact most other <a href="archosaur">archosaur</a>s. It is considered highly unlikely that the fifth digit or antorbital fenestra would <a href="evolution">evolve</a> a second time.

In 2014, the describers of a new taxon of basal ceratopsian published a phylogenetic analysis encompassing "Psittacosaurus". The below cladogram is from their analysis, placing the genus as one of the most primitive ceratopsians. The authors (Farke "et al.") noted that all taxa outside of <a href="Leptoceratopsidae">Leptoceratopsidae</a> and <a href="Coronosauria">Coronosauria</a> with the exception of their genus "<a href="Aquilops">Aquilops</a>" are from Asia, meaning the group likely originated there.

Although many species of "Psittacosaurus" have been named, their relationships to each other have not yet been fully explored and no scientific consensus exists on the subject. Several <a href="phylogenetics">phylogenetic</a> analyses have been published, with the most detailed being those by <a href="Alexander%20Averianov">Alexander Averianov</a> and colleagues in 2006, <a href="Hai-Lu%20You">Hai-Lu You</a> and colleagues in 2008, and <a href="Paul%20Sereno">Paul Sereno</a> in 2010. The middle one is shown below.

In 2005, Zhou and colleagues suggested that "P. lujiatunensis" is basal to all other species. This would be consistent with its earlier appearance in the fossil record.

The brain of "P. lujiatunensis" is well known; a study on the anatomy and functionality of three specimens was published in 2007. Until the study, it was generally thought the brain of "Psittacosaurus" would have been similar to other ceratopsians with low <a href="Encephalisation%20Quotient">Encephalisation Quotient</a>s. Russell and Zhao (1996) believed "the small brain size of psittacosaurs implies a very restrictive behavioural repertoire relative to that of modern mammals of similar body size". However, the 2007 study dispelled this theory when it found the brain to be more advanced. There is generally negative <a href="allometry">allometry</a> for brain size with development in vertebrates, but this was shown not to be true in "Psittacosaurus". The EQ score for "P. lujiatunensis" is 0.31, significantly higher than genera such as "Triceratops". A higher EQ correlates with more complex behaviour, and various dinosaurs have high EQs, similar to birds, which range from 0.36 to 2.98. Thus, "Psittacosaurus" behaviour could have been as complex as that in "<a href="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus</a>", whose EQ ranges from 0.30 to 0.38. Behaviours influenced by high EQs include nest-building, parental care, and bird-like sleeping, some of which have been shown to be present in "Psittacosaurus".

The senses of "Psittacosaurus" can be inferred from the <a href="endocast">endocast</a>. Large <a href="olfactory%20bulb">olfactory bulb</a>s are present, indicating the genus had an acute sense of smell. The size of these bulbs are comparable to large predatory theropods, although they likely evolved to avoid predators instead of to seek out prey. The <a href="sclerotic%20ring">sclerotic ring</a>s in reptiles directly show the size of the eyeball. The rings are not well preserved in "Psittacosaurus", with one individual preserving them likely contracted postmortem, but if they are similar to those of "<a href="Protoceratops">Protoceratops</a>", "Psittacosaurus" would have had large eyes and acute vision. The curvature of the <a href="semicircular%20canals">semicircular canals</a> is related to the agility of reptiles, and the large curved canals in "Psittacosaurus" show that the genus was much more agile than later ceratopsians. Comparisons between the <a href="sclerotic%20ring">scleral ring</a>s of "Psittacosaurus" and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been <a href="Cathemerality">cathemeral</a>, active throughout the day and for short intervals at night.

Ford and Martin (2010) proposed that "Psittacosaurus" was semi-aquatic, swimming with its tail like a crocodile, and paddling and kicking. They based their interpretation on evidence including: the lacustrine (lake) depositional setting of many specimens; the position of the nostrils and eyes; interpretations of the motions of the arms and legs; tails with long <a href="chevron%20%28anatomy%29">chevrons</a> (and with the bristles on the tail interpreted as possibly skin-covered, forming a fin), providing a propulsive surface; and the presence of <a href="gastroliths">gastroliths</a>, interpreted as ballast. They further suggested that some species of "Psittacosaurus" were more terrestrial than others.

Psittacosaurs had self-sharpening teeth that would have been useful for cropping and slicing tough plant material. Unlike later ceratopsians, they did not have teeth suitable for grinding or chewing their food. Instead, they used gastroliths—stones swallowed to wear down food as it passed through the digestive system. Sometimes numbering more than fifty, these stones are occasionally found in the abdominal cavities of psittacosaurs, and may have been stored in a <a href="gizzard">gizzard</a>, as in modern birds.

Unlike many other dinosaurs, psittacosaurs had akinetic skulls: that is to say, the upper and lower jaws each behaved as a single unit, without internal joints. The only joint was the jaw joint itself, and psittacosaurs could slide their lower jaws forward and backward on the joint, permitting a shearing action. Unlike most ceratopsians, their beaks did not form curved tips, but were instead rounded and flattened. If the jaws were aligned, the beaks could be used to crop objects, but if the lower jaw was retracted so that the lower beak was inside the upper beak, the jaws may have served a nutcracking function. A nut- or seed-rich diet would also match well with the gastroliths often seen in well-preserved psittacosaur skeletons.

Studies by Phil Senter in 2007 conducted on "P. neimongoliensis" and "P. mongoliensis" concluded that the forelimbs of these taxa (and likely those of other "Psittacosaurus" species) were too short (only about 58% as long as the hindlimbs) to reach the ground, and their range of motion indicates they could neither be <a href="pronated">pronated</a> nor generate propulsive force for locomotion, suggesting that "Psittacosaurus" was entirely bipedal. The forelimbs were also too short to be used in digging or bringing food to the mouth, and Senter suggested that if "Psittacosaurus" needed to dig depressions in the ground it may have used its hindlimbs instead. The forelimbs could be used for two-handed grasping of objects or scratching the body, but due to their extremely limited flexibility and reach, they could have only been used to grasp objects very close to the belly or sides of the animal and could have scratched only the belly, flank and knees. Even though the hands could not reach the mouth, "Psittacosaurus" could have still used them to carry nesting material or food to a desired location.

However, "Psittacosaurus" may not have been entirely bipedal for its entire lifespan. Taking sections from the limb bones of 16 specimens of "Psittacosaurus", ranging in age from less than a year old to ten-year-old adults, Qi Zhao from the University of Bristol found that "Psittacosaurus" was probably secondarily bipedal. The infants' front limbs grew at faster rates than the hind limbs at between birth and three years of age. At the age of between four and six years, arm growth slowed and leg growth accelerated as the animal became mature. At this stage, "Psittacosaurs" would switch to a bipedal stance. These findings further reveal that the ancestor of "Psittacosaurus" was likely quadrupedal and eventually gained the ability to become bipedal as it evolved, with the young retaining the quadrupedal gait of the ancestor in question. These findings also lead to the hypothesis that many such dinosaur families may have evolved along this path at some point in their evolution.

Several juvenile "Psittacosaurus" have been found. The smallest is a "P. mongoliensis" hatchling conserved in the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a> (AMNH), which is only 11 to 13 centimetres (4–5 inches) long, with a skull in length. Another hatchling skull at the AMNH is only long. Both specimens are from Mongolia. Juveniles discovered in the Yixian Formation are approximately the same age as the larger AMNH specimen.

A <a href="histology">histological</a> examination of "P. mongoliensis" has determined the growth rate of these animals. The smallest specimens in the study were estimated at three years old and less than , while the largest were nine years old and weighed almost . This indicates relatively rapid growth compared to most reptiles and <a href="marsupial">marsupial</a> mammals, but slower than modern <a href="bird">bird</a>s and <a href="placental">placental</a> mammals. An <a href="Age%20determination%20of%20dinosaurs">age determination</a> study performed on the <a href="fossil">fossil</a>ized remains of "P. mongoliensis" by using growth ring counts suggest that the longevity of the <a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> ceratopsian was 10 to 11 years.

The find of a herd of six "Psittacosaurus" individuals killed and buried by a volcanic mudflow indicates the presence of at least two age groups from two distinct clutches gathered together. This find has been taken as evidence for group fidelity and <a href="Dinosaur%20behavior%23Ceratopsian%20behavior">gregariousness</a> extending beyond the nest; the earliest such evidence for any ceratopsian. Even very young psittacosaur teeth appear worn, indicating they chewed their own food and may have been <a href="precocial">precocial</a>. Another juvenile-only cluster shows that specimens of different ages grouped together. These juveniles may have associated together as a close knit, mixed-age herd either for protection, to enhance their foraging, or as putative helpers at the parental nest. There is no evidence for parental care.

In 2004, a specimen found in the Yixian Formation was claimed as evidence for parental care in dinosaurs. The specimen DNHM D2156 consists of 34 articulated juvenile "Psittacosaurus" skeletons, closely associated with the skull of an adult. The juveniles, all approximately the same age, are intertwined in a group underneath the adult, although all 34 skulls are positioned above the mass of bodies, as they would have been in life. This suggests that the animals were alive at the time of burial, which must have been extremely rapid, perhaps due to the collapse of a <a href="burrow">burrow</a>. However, a 2013 paper pointed out that the adult specimen did not belong with the nest, its skull having no sedimentary connection to the main slab where the juveniles occurred, but had been glued onto it. This artificial association led to the inference that the skull belonged to an individual, possibly a "mother", that was providing parental care for the 34 juveniles—a claim that is unfounded. Furthermore, the adult was also shown to be six years old, whereas histological studies have shown "P. mongoliensis" was unable to breed until it reached ten years of age. It is also unlikely that a single female would have so many offspring at one time.

A 2014 analysis of the same specimen supported the association and concluded that the proximity of the six-year-old specimen to the post-hatchlings may indicate post-hatchling cooperation, making the six-year-old specimen a possible caretaker.

Out of the hundreds of known "Psittacosaurus" specimens, only one has been described to possess any sort of <a href="pathology">pathology</a>. The specimen in question, consisting of a complete adult skeleton and tentatively assigned to "P. mongoliensis", was found in the lower beds of the Yixian Formation. There is no sign of a <a href="bone%20fracture">bone fracture</a>, but very clear signs of an <a href="infection">infection</a> can be seen near the midpoint of the right <a href="fibula">fibula</a>. The bone exhibits a large round pit, evidence of <a href="necrosis">necrosis</a> due to a lack of <a href="blood">blood</a> supply to the region. The pit is surrounded by a massive amount of swelling along the lower third of the bone. This large amount of bone deposited around the injury indicates that the animal survived for quite a while despite the injury and subsequent infection. As psittacosaurids were bipedal animals, a similar injury to a <a href="weight%20bearing">weight bearing</a> bone in the leg would most likely have been fatal. Unlike the femur and <a href="tibia">tibia</a>, the fibula is not a weight-bearing bone, so this animal would still have been able to walk to some extent. The source of the injury remains unknown.

Another fossil from the Yixian Formation provides direct evidence of "Psittacosaurus" as a <a href="prey">prey</a> animal. One skeleton of "<a href="Repenomamus">Repenomamus robustus</a>", a large <a href="triconodont">triconodont</a> mammal, is preserved with the remains of a juvenile "Psittacosaurus" in its abdominal cavity. Several of the juvenile's bones are still articulated, indicating that the <a href="carnivore">carnivorous</a> mammal swallowed its prey in large chunks. This specimen is notable in that it is the first-known example of <a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> mammals preying on live dinosaurs. Heavy predation on juvenile "Psittacosaurus" may have resulted in <a href="R/K%20selection%20theory">R-selection</a>, the production of more numerous offspring to counteract this loss.

"Psittacosaurus" is known from hundreds of individual specimens, of which over 75 have been assigned to the type species, "P. mongoliensis". All "Psittacosaurus" fossils discovered so far have been found in <a href="Early%20Cretaceous">Early Cretaceous</a> sediments in Asia, from southern <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a> to northern China, and possibly as far south as Thailand. The most common age of <a href="geologic%20formation">geologic formation</a>s bearing "Psittacosaurus" fossils is from the late <a href="Barremian">Barremian</a> through <a href="Albian">Albian</a> stages of the Early Cretaceous, or approximately 126 to 101 <a href="Mya%20%28unit%29">mya</a> (<a href="million%20years%20ago">million years ago</a>). Many terrestrial <a href="sedimentary">sedimentary</a> formations of this age in Mongolia and northern China have produced fossils of "Psittacosaurus", leading to the definition of this time period in the region as the "Psittacosaurus" biochron.

The earliest known species is "P. lujiatunensis", found in the lowest beds of the Yixian Formation. Over 200 specimens attributed to this genus have been recovered from these and other beds of the Yixian, the age of which is the subject of much debate. Although many early studies using <a href="radiometric%20dating">radiometric dating</a> put the Yixian in the <a href="Jurassic%20Period">Jurassic Period</a>, tens of millions of years outside of the expected temporal range of "Psittacosaurus", most recent work dates it to the Early Cretaceous. Using <a href="argon%E2%80%93argon%20dating">argon–argon dating</a>, a team of Chinese scientists dated the lowest <a href="stratum">beds</a> in the formation to about 128 mya, and the highest to approximately 122 mya. A more recent Chinese study, using <a href="uranium%E2%80%93lead%20dating">uranium–lead dating</a>, suggests that the lower beds are younger, approximately 123.2 mya, while agreeing with an age of 122 mya for the upper beds.

Flight Unlimited III

Flight Unlimited III is a 1999 <a href="flight%20simulator">flight simulator</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> developed by <a href="Looking%20Glass%20Studios">Looking Glass Studios</a> and published by <a href="Electronic%20Arts">Electronic Arts</a>. It allows players to pilot simulations of real-world commercial and civilian aircraft in and around <a href="Seattle">Seattle, Washington</a>. Players can fly freely or engage in "Challenge" missions, such as thwarting a theft or locating <a href="Bigfoot">Bigfoot</a>. The development team built on the <a href="general%20aviation">general aviation</a> gameplay of "<a href="Flight%20Unlimited%20II">Flight Unlimited II</a>", with more detailed physics and terrain, more planes, and a real-time weather system. Roughly half of "Flight Unlimited II"s team returned to work on the sequel, supported by new hires.

Lead designer Peter James described "Flight Unlimited III"s development as a struggle, thanks to a lack of interest from Electronic Arts and from Looking Glass's management. Placed in direct competition with "<a href="Microsoft%20Flight%20Simulator%202000">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000</a>" and "<a href="Fly%21">Fly!</a>", the game failed to capture sufficient <a href="market%20share">market share</a>. It became one of Looking Glass's biggest commercial flops, with roughly 20,000 units sold in the United States during 1999. This contributed to the company's closure in 2000. The game was well received by critics, who praised its terrain rendering and dynamic weather. Its <a href="Game%20physics">simulated physics</a> were lauded by several reviewers, but others felt that the physics were imprecise and that the game's <a href="system%20requirements">system requirements</a> were extremely high.

"Flight Unlimited III" is a <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">three-dimensional</a> (3D) <a href="flight%20simulator">flight simulator</a> video game, in which the player pilots virtual reproductions of real-world planes. Players may control ten aircraft: the <a href="Lake%20Renegade">Lake Turbo Renegade</a>, <a href="Stemme%20S10">Stemme S10</a>, <a href="Mooney%20M20">Mooney Bravo</a>, <a href="Fokker%20Dr.I">Fokker Dr.I</a>, <a href="Hawker%20400">Beechjet 400A</a>, and five planes first included in "<a href="Flight%20Unlimited%20II">Flight Unlimited II</a>". Plane cockpits feature simulated <a href="flight%20instrument">flight instrument</a>s such as <a href="variometer">variometer</a>s and <a href="primary%20flight%20display">primary flight display</a>s, and allow for both <a href="Visual%20flight%20rules">visual</a> and <a href="Instrument%20flight%20rules">instrument</a> navigation. The main airspace is 10,000 <a href="square%20mile">square mile</a>s of <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a> terrain; eight other <a href="Western%20United%20States">Western American states</a> are modeled as well, albeit in less detail. The <a href="California">California</a> scenery from "Flight Unlimited II" may be <a href="Import%20and%20export%20of%20data">imported</a> to expand the airspace. The player shares the game's skies with <a href="Artificial%20intelligence%20%28video%20games%29">artificially intelligent</a> (AI) planes. Real-time, interactive <a href="air%20traffic%20control">air traffic control</a> monitors the player's actions and tries to prevent <a href="mid-air%20collision">mid-air collision</a>s. Before a flight, the player may select which types of weather to encounter. Weather conditions such as <a href="cold%20front">cold front</a>s and thunderstorms develop in real-time.

In addition to the default "Quick Flight" mode, the player may play tutorial and "Challenge" missions. The game's tutorial mode features 26 lessons, which demonstrate basic and advanced flying techniques and then allow the player to perform them. Challenge missions test the player's flying ability with objectives such as locating <a href="Bigfoot">Bigfoot</a>, rescuing a stranded hiker, stopping a theft, or flying through hoops. Eleven Challenges are available, but the player may create more or download them from the Internet. "Flight Unlimited III" includes the <a href="level%20editor">level editor</a> ("FLED") used to develop the game, which allows players to use the game's <a href="3D%20modeling">assets</a> to create airports, AI flight paths, and edited landscapes. Players may share their creations online.

Following the release of "Flight Unlimited II" in 1997, certain members of that game's team wanted to move on to "Flight Unlimited III", while others wanted to create the <a href="combat%20flight%20simulator">combat flight simulator</a> game "<a href="Jane%27s%20Attack%20Squadron">Flight Combat</a>". <a href="Looking%20Glass%20Studios">Looking Glass Studios</a> chose to develop the games simultaneously: the team was split into two, both supplemented with new hires. The company then surveyed customers to determine where "Flight Unlimited III" should take place, among other things. In May 1998, <a href="Electronic%20Arts">Electronic Arts</a> was announced as the game's publisher, as part of a multi-title marketing and distribution deal that also included "<a href="System%20Shock%202">System Shock 2</a>". Looking Glass's goal was to build on the foundation of "Flight Unlimited II" and to provide what project leader Tom Sperry called "the true joy and sensation of flight in the most realistic environment available". The company first displayed "Flight Unlimited III" at the "MicroWINGS" Conference in August 1998. At the show, the game was revealed to take place in and around Seattle—a choice based on fan requests and on the varied landscape and weather of <a href="Puget%20Sound">Puget Sound</a>. Looking Glass also discussed new planes, moving objects on the ground, and a real-time, physics-based weather system.

Former <a href="flight%20instructor">flight instructor</a> Peter James, who had worked on "Flight Unlimited II", assumed the role of lead designer. He was largely responsible for "Flight Unlimited III"'s lessons, planes, and simulated <a href="flight%20instruments">flight instruments</a>. James believed that other flight simulators had holes with regard to realism, and he hoped to create a more accurate experience. Photographs were captured of each plane's real-world counterpart, and construction of the 3D plane models was led by artist Duncan Hsu, a former car modeler at <a href="Papyrus%20Design%20Group">Papyrus Design Group</a>. The flight physics were coded by Kevin Wasserman and involve real-time calculations of <a href="Euclidean%20vector">force vectors</a>, such as those acting against a plane's <a href="Yaw%20%28rotation%29">yaw</a>, pitch, and roll. This system was more advanced than that of "Flight Unlimited II", which was also based on force calculations. The physics code was informed by "real aircraft data" and the personal experience of pilots, and each of the planes was flown as research for the game. Because the plane cockpits of previous "Flight Unlimited" games had been criticized by pilots, the team tried to make "Flight Unlimited III"s cockpits extremely authentic. Kemal Amarasingham recorded the planes' sound effects, which he said involved "risking his life" by standing near jet engines and underwings.

The game's terrain <a href="Texture%20mapping">texture maps</a> were made with <a href="Satellite%20imagery">satellite images</a> rendered at four <a href="square%20meters%20per%20pixel">square meters per pixel</a>, the highest resolution used in a flight simulator at that time. Artist Karen Wolff designed the terrain by combining large <a href="topographic%20map">topographic map</a>s into a "mosaic", which recreated the elevations and depressions of the Seattle area. The satellite imagery was layered over the resultant polygonal mesh. Real elevation data was also used for the eight lower-resolution Western American states outside of the Seattle area. Budget concerns and the <a href="Computer%20data%20storage">storage</a> limitations of the <a href="CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a> format prevented the team from rendering the entire United States, despite fan demand. The 3D objects that move across the terrain were created by Yoosun Cho, who used numerous photography books for inspiration. "Flight Unlimited III"s object editor let her set these objects to "move once along the path, back and forth or cycle". The weather system, co-designed by James, generates, moves, and disperses <a href="weather%20front">weather front</a>s based on real-time calculations of atmospheric conditions such as <a href="humidity">humidity</a> and <a href="orographic%20lift">orographic lift</a>.

While visiting Looking Glass to cover "Flight Unlimited III"s development, journalist Dan Linton was impressed by the team management of Tom Sperry, producer Sandra Smith, and vice president of marketing Michael Malizola. He wrote that they employed "suggestion and encouragement" instead of "demands", and he believed that their work was in large part responsible for the game "setting a new standard in the industry". Peter James later accused the wider company's management of being lukewarm toward "Flight Unlimited III" during development, since their biggest sellers were action-oriented games like "". He claimed that their lack of interest turned the optimistic team into a "grumbling group of depressed and sometimes angry [people]". Although he, Smith, and Perry petitioned the company's managers to plan future add-ons and third-party development for the game, James felt that they were ignored. James developed concepts for a sequel in his spare time, but his ideas were shelved to wait for "Flight Unlimited III"s sales figures, which had to surpass those of "<a href="Microsoft%20Flight%20Simulator">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000</a>" for "Flight Unlimited IV" to be greenlit. James believed that this was "foolish", particularly because he felt that Electronic Arts undermarketed the game. He wrote that "Flight Unlimited III"'s marketing manager had "great plans" but that his "hands seem[ed] tied".

"Flight Unlimited III"s official site was opened in March 1999, and the game was shown alongside "Flight Combat: Thunder Over Europe" at the <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> in May. Tal Blevins of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> wrote that the game had "come a long way" since he had seen it earlier in the year, and that it was almost complete, with development of the real-time weather system in its final stages. "Full Throttle" noted the game's "impressive clouds" and "slick looking" HUD. "Flight Unlimited III" was shown again at <a href="EAA%20AirVenture%20Oshkosh">EAA AirVenture Oshkosh</a> in July, at which point <a href="Software%20testing">beta testing</a> was nearly complete and the game was "90% done", according to James. He stated that the public reaction was "great", which energized the team for a short time. The game <a href="Going%20gold">went gold</a> that August, nine months behind schedule. James wrote that the team celebrated with a small dinner party, and that "the next few days were spent finding out how many people [were] quitting." He left after the game's completion to join <a href="Flightsim.com">Flightsim.com</a>, a news and review website dedicated to flight simulators. The game was released on September 17, 1999.

"Flight Unlimited III" was placed in direct competition with flight simulators such as "<a href="Fly%21">Fly!</a>" and "Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000". The game failed to capture sufficient market share and became one of Looking Glass's biggest commercial flops. It sold roughly 20,000 copies in the United States during 1999. The game later earned a "Silver" sales award from the <a href="Entertainment%20and%20Leisure%20Software%20Publishers%20Association">Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association</a> (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. Together with the costly development of "Flight Combat", the game's low sales used up Looking Glass's earnings from "Thief: The Dark Project" and "System Shock 2", which had helped them recover from the failures of "<a href="British%20Open%20Championship%20Golf">British Open Championship Golf</a>" and "". These events contributed to the company's bankruptcy and closure in May 2000. The game was, however, positively received by critics, with an aggregate review score of 88% on <a href="GameRankings">GameRankings</a>.

Josh Nolan of "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>" wrote, ""FU3" is experience-oriented: it's user-friendly, graphically glamorous, and lots of fun." While he praised its visuals and air traffic control, he considered the game to be simpler than "<a href="Flight%20Simulator%202000">Flight Simulator 2000</a>" because of its less detailed lessons, interfaces, and flight physics. The magazine later nominated "Flight Unlimited III" as the 1999 "Simulation of the Year". Writing for "<a href="Computer%20Games%20Magazine">Computer Games Magazine</a>", Denny Atkin stated that the use of <a href="turbulence">turbulence</a> "really sets "FU3" apart from the competition", and that the game's simulation of air traffic is "like no other sim". He praised its graphics and dynamic weather, and he found the flight physics solid in general but "overly gentle" for <a href="aerobatics">aerobatic</a> maneuvers. He concluded, "It's not only an excellent simulus of general aviation flying, ... it's even a good "game"." "<a href="PC%20Gamer%20UK">PC Gamer UK</a>"s Dean Evans wrote that the game has "a poetic grandeur", as well as an "astonishing attention to detail" greater than that of its predecessors. He praised its flight lessons and weather, and he considered the graphics to be "unbelievably delicious". Evans summarized the game as "the most breathtaking flying experience you can get for a PC."

Simon Bradley of "<a href="PC%20Zone">PC Zone</a>" wrote, ""FUIII" has atmosphere in a way that "<a href="Microsoft%20Combat%20Flight%20Simulator">MS Combat Flight Sim</a>" can't even dream of." He praised its graphics, flight physics, and detailed flight environment. He also complained of "unflyably slow <a href="frame%20rate">frame rate</a>s" and warned that the game could not be played on older computers. Tony Lopez of <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> called the game's environmental modeling "simply breathtaking" and noted that elevations were rendered more smoothly than in "<a href="Fly%21">Fly!</a>" or "Microsoft Flight Simulator". He wrote that the game's flight physics and weather simulation were superior to those of any other flight simulator and that the "powerful, easy-to-use" FLED editing tool could popularize the game. <a href="IGN">IGN</a> writer Marc Saltzman commented that the game features "absolutely stunning terrain at all altitudes, realistic weather and lighting effects, and highly-detailed planes". Saltzman praised the accuracy of "Flight Unlimited III"s physics but remarked that the game's frame rate was "noticeably slower" than that of its rivals.

Tumbler Ridge

Tumbler Ridge is a <a href="district%20municipality">district municipality</a> in the foothills of the <a href="Canadian%20Rockies">Canadian Rockies</a> in northeastern <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, Canada, and a member municipality of the <a href="Peace%20River%20Regional%20District">Peace River Regional District</a>. The municipality of , with its population of 1,987  people, incorporates a townsite and a large area of mostly <a href="Crown%20Land">Crown Land</a>. The housing and municipal infrastructure, along with regional infrastructure connecting the <a href="new%20town">new town</a> to other municipalities, were built simultaneously in 1981 by the provincial government to service the <a href="coal%20in%20Canada">coal industry</a> as part of the <a href="British%20Columbia%20Resources%20Investment%20Corporation">British Columbia Resources Investment Corporation</a>'s Northeast Coal Development.

In 1981, a consortium of Japanese steel mills agreed to purchase 100 million tonnes of coal over 15 years for US$7.5 billion from two mining companies, <a href="Denison%20Mines">Denison Mines Inc.</a> and the <a href="Teck%20Cominco">Teck Corporation</a>, who were to operate the Quintette mine and the Bullmoose mine respectively. Declining global coal prices after 1981, and <a href="East%20Asian%20financial%20crisis">weakening Asian markets</a> in the late 1990s, made the town's future uncertain and kept it from achieving its projected population of 10,000 people. The uncertainty dissuaded investment and kept the economy from diversifying. When price reductions were forced onto the mines, the Quintette mine was closed in 2000 production and the town lost about half its population. Coal prices began to rise after the turn of the century, leading to the opening of the Peace River Coal Trend mine by Northern Energy & Mining Inc. (now owned by Anglo American Met Coal) and the Wolverine Mine, originally owned by Western Canadian Coal, which was purchased by <a href="Walter%20Energy">Walter Energy</a> in 2010.

After dinosaur footprints, fossils, and bones were discovered in the municipality, along with <a href="fossil">fossil</a>s of <a href="Triassic">Triassic</a> fishes and <a href="cretaceous">cretaceous</a> plants, the Peace Region Paleontology Research Center opened in 2003. The research centre and a dinosaur museum were funded in part by the federal <a href="Western%20Economic%20Diversification%20Canada">Western Economic Diversification Canada</a> to decrease economic dependence on the coal industry. In 2018, the museum to change its operations from science-based to tourism-attraction.

In 2014, both operating coal mines were put into "care and maintenance mode". This means the mines are effectively closed, but are still allowed to restart without needing to go through the process of getting a new mines act permit.

Economic diversification has also occurred with oil and gas exploration, forestry, and recreational tourism. Nearby recreational destinations include numerous trails, mountains, waterfalls, snowmobiling areas and <a href="List%20of%20British%20Columbia%20Provincial%20Parks">provincial parks</a>, such as <a href="Monkman%20Provincial%20Park">Monkman Provincial Park</a>, <a href="Bearhole%20Lake%20Provincial%20Park%20and%20Protected%20Area">Bearhole Lake Provincial Park</a>, and <a href="Gwillim%20Lake%20Provincial%20Park">Gwillim Lake Provincial Park</a>.

Archaeological evidence show a human presence dating back 3,000 years. The nomadic <a href="Sekani">Sekani</a>, followed by the <a href="Dunneza">Dunneza</a> and then the <a href="Cree">Cree</a>, periodically lived in temporary settlements around the future municipality. Formal exploratory and surveying expeditions were conducted by S. Prescott Fay, with Robert Cross and Fred Brewster in 1914, J.C. Gwillim in 1919, Edmund Spieker in 1920, and John Holzworth in 1923. Spieker coined the name "Tumbler Ridge", referring to the mountains northwest of the future town, by altering Gwillim's map that named them "Tumbler Range". Permanent settlers were squatters, five families by 1920, who maintained <a href="Animal%20trapping">trap lines</a>. In the 1950s and 1960s, oil and natural gas exploration and logging was conducted through the area, and 15 significant coal deposits were discovered. Coal prices rose after the <a href="1973%20oil%20crisis">1973 oil crisis</a> leading to 40 government studies examining the viability of accessing the coal, given the 1,130 km (700 mi) to the nearest port and the mountainous barrier.

With these coal deposits in mind, a purchasing agreement was signed in 1981 by two Canadian mining companies, a consortium of Japanese steel mills, and the governments of British Columbia and Canada. As part of the deal, the provincial government committed, under the North East Coal Development plan, to build a <a href="new%20town">new town</a> near the deposits, two highways off <a href="British%20Columbia%20Highway%2097%23John%20Hart%20Highway">Highway 97</a>, a power line from the <a href="W.%20A.%20C.%20Bennett%20Dam">W. A. C. Bennett Dam</a> at <a href="Hudson%27s%20Hope%2C%20British%20Columbia">Hudson's Hope</a>, and a <a href="branch%20line">branch rail line</a> through the Rocky Mountains. An alternative of using work camps staffed by people from Dawson Creek and Chetwynd was also considered. Massive initial investments were required as planning for the new town began in 1976 with the objective of having a fully functioning town ready before residents arrived. Coordinated through the provincial Ministry of Municipal Affairs the town, regional infrastructure, and mining plants were all built simultaneously. When the municipality was incorporated in April 1981 the area was completely forested. During that year building sites and roadways were cleared and in the winter the water and sewerage system was built. In 1982, houses and other buildings were constructed. Full production at the mines was reached the following year.

In early 1983, the families of the managers at the Bullmoose Minesite, led by Dean Sawas appealed to the British Columbia government and were able to create a new settlement, called Bullmoose Settlement. This was done because Dean's wife was expecting and he wanted his child to have something different to say about her birthplace. He wanted her to be able to say that a settlement had been created for her and that she was, and would always be the only one born at that place. At her birth, Alicia V. Sawas was also written into the Tumbler Ridge records as the first child born in the Quintette area. Bullmoose Settlement was closed down after the reduction in mine activities with just the one birth.

In 1984, world coal prices were dropping and the Japanese consortium requested a reduction in the price of coal from the Tumbler Ridge mines. As price reduction requests continued, the concern over the viability of the mines led the <a href="BC%20Assessment%20Authority">BC Assessment Authority</a> to lower the 1987 property assessments for the Quintette mine from <a href="CAD%24">CAD$</a>156 million to $89 million and the Bullmoose mine $70 million to $43 million. This lowered their taxes as they tried to enforce the purchasing agreement at the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Canada">Supreme Court of Canada</a>. Their 1990 ruling required the Quintette Operations Company to reduce coal prices and reimburse the Japanese consortium $4.6 million. The company responded by reducing production, cutting employment, and applying for court protection from creditors. This allowed Teck to acquire 50% interest and take over management of the Quintette mine, but it was unable to stop further job losses. As most residents left town, apartment blocks were closed and the mine companies bought back all but 11 houses in the town. After 30% of the workforce had been laid off, new contracts with the Japanese consortium were signed in 1997, allowing re-hirings to begin, but with lower export levels. The North East Coal Development was projected to create a net benefit of <a href="CAD%24">CAD$</a>0.9 billion (2000), but incurred a net loss of $2.8 billion and half the expected regional employment.

The population declined as many residents were unable to find other work in the town, even as a sawmill for specialty woods opened in 1999. After Teck closed the Quintette mine in August 2000 and shifted production to the lower cost Bullmoose mine, the town council established the Tumbler Ridge Revitalization Task Force to investigate ways to boost and diversify the economy. The Task Force negotiated the return of the housing stock from the mines to the free market, grants from the province to become debt-free, and stabilized funds from the province for healthcare and education. The discovery of dinosaur tracks in 2000 by two local boys while playing near a creek, led to major fossil and bone discoveries from the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> Period. To survey and study the finds, government funding was secured to found both the Tumbler Ridge Museum Foundation and Peace Region Palaeontology Research Centre.

After the Bullmoose mine exhausted its supply of coal in 2003, world coal prices increased, making exploration and mining in Tumbler Ridge economically feasible again. Western Canadian Coal opened new open-pit mining operations creating the Dillon mine using Bullmoose mining infrastructure, the Brule mine near <a href="Chetwynd%2C%20British%20Columbia">Chetwynd</a> using new infrastructure (projected 11-year life span), and the Wolverine mine. These mines were purchased by Walter Energy in 2010, but world coal prices began to drop again in 2011, and in April 2014, Walter put their Canadian operations into "care and maintenance mode", laying off nearly 700 people.

The Peace River Coal Trend Mine was issued its mines act permit in 2005, and was a partnership between NEMI Northern Energy and Mining Inc., Anglo American, Hillsborough Resources and Vitol Anker International. In 2011, Anglo American bought out the rest of the partners to become sole owner of the property.

Anglo American started working on the Roman Pit next to their existing Trend operation in 2014, hoping to reduce the cost of production per tonne of coal. However, in late 2014, they announced the mine would be going into care and maintenance mode as well.

As of Fall, 2015, there are no coal mines operating in Tumbler Ridge. However, HD Mining is continuing work on the Murray River Coal Mine, a proposed Underground Longwall Mine near Tumbler Ridge. The company was issued its Environmental Assessment Certificate from the BC Government in October 2015, though construction on the mine, if it were to go ahead, is not expected to begin until after a Mines Act Permit is issued, which is not expected until late 2016.

On September 22, 2014, the area around Tumbler Ridge was designated North America's second <a href="Geopark">Geopark</a>.

Population projections in 1977 were for 3,568 residents in 1981, 7,940 in 1985, and 10,584 in 1987, after which the level was expected to stabilize. However, requests for lower coal prices shortly after the production began placed a persistent insecurity over the viability of the mines, and therefore the town, discouraging long term investments. Temporary work camps, where workers numbered between 200 and 2,000, were used during the construction of the town and mines. The planners of the town advised the mining companies to hire workers who were married, believing they would live in Tumbler Ridge longer and reduce employment turn-over. The population rose slowly to 3,833 people in 1984, nearly half the projected level. The <a href="Canada%201986%20Census">1986 Canadian census</a>, the first census to include Tumbler Ridge, recorded 4,566 residents after which in-migration ended and the population level began to fluctuate. The population peaked in 1991 at 4,794 people but then declined to a low of 1,932 people in 2001. Since then, population growth has been led by new mining activities and increased exploration following higher world energy prices. The town's population is currently in a state of flux as people dependent on the mines for work leave, while other people, attracted by the town's low rent, arrive.

The <a href="Canada%202006%20Census">Canada 2006 Census</a> reported 2,454 residents living in 1,045 households and 765 families. This was 27% more people than the previous census five years earlier when the town was at its lowest population level since opening. The median age increased from 38.8 years in 2001 to 42.2 in 2006, as the proportion of the population aged over 65 rose from 5% to 11%. In 2006, of those over 15 years of age, 62% were married, higher than the 54% provincial average. The town has few <a href="visible%20minorities">visible minorities</a> as 94% of Tumbler Ridge residents were Canadian-born and 93% had English as their <a href="first%20language">first language</a>. Though not included as a minority, 9% of residents claimed to have an Aboriginal identity. Reflecting the nature of the industrial jobs available in town, in 2001, only 12% of residents between 20 and 64 years of age completed university, half of the provincial average, and 26% did not complete high school, much higher than the 19% provincial average.
In 2005, the five officer Tumbler Ridge <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Mounted%20Police">Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a> municipal detachment reported 346 <a href="Criminal%20Code%20%28Canada%29">Criminal Code</a> offences. This translated into a crime rate of 137 Criminal Code offences per 1,000 people, higher than the provincial average of 119 offences. During that year, the RCMP reported lower crime rates in Tumbler Ridge, compared with the provincial averages, in all categories except bicycle thefts, property damage, impaired driving, and cannabis-related offences. Until 2005, the town had a lower crime rate than the province, except between 2001 and 2003 after the Quintette mine closure and a large out-migration from the town. In 2004 the Tumbler Ridge RCMP reported no robbery or shoplifting offences, and only 4.5 theft-from-motor-vehicle offences per 1,000 people compared with 20 provincially.

The townsite is located on a series of southern-facing gravel terraces on a ridge of Mount Bergeron, overlooking the confluence of the Murray and Wolverine Rivers. The site, above the floodplain of the Murray River, has well-drained soils with easy access to aquifers with potable water. The rocks, mostly <a href="shale">shale</a> and <a href="mudstone">mudstone</a> but lacking quartzite, make the mountains less rugged than their neighbouring ranges. The terraces grow <a href="Lodgepole%20Pine">Lodgepole Pine</a>, <a href="Picea%20glauca">White Spruce</a>, <a href="Populus%20tremuloides">Trembling Aspen</a> trees. Moose and elk are common. Escarpments to the east and north could pose a snow avalanche threat but are kept forested for stability. In 2006, the town was evacuated for several days as four <a href="wildfire">forest fires</a> approached the town.

Major coal deposits indicate the site was a swampy forest during the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>. Paleontologists have discovered tracks or fossils from <a href="ankylosauria">ankylosauria</a>, <a href="ornithopod">ornithopod</a>s (including a <a href="Hadrosaurus">Hadrosaurus</a>), and <a href="theropod">theropod</a>s. Fossils of Cretaceous plants such as ferns, redwoods, cycads, and <a href="ginkgo">ginkgo</a>, and <a href="Triassic">Triassic</a> fishes and reptiles such as <a href="coelacanth">coelacanth</a>, <a href="weigeltisaurus">weigeltisaurus</a>, and <a href="ichthyosaur">ichthyosaur</a> have been recovered.

The town experiences a continental climate. Arctic air masses move predominantly southwestly from the Mackenzie Valley towards the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> and through the mountains north of town. The town is in a <a href="rain%20shadow">rain shadow</a> behind Mount Bergeron, though much of the precipitation is lost in the mountains beforehand. Town planners laid out the roads so that they run along wind breaks, and buildings and parks are located in wind shadows.
After examining other resource towns in Canada, the planners followed socio-spatial guidelines and principles in physical planning. The coal mining facilities were well separated from the townsite to minimize the feeling of a company town. An attempt to mitigate potential lifestyle conflicts between families and childless households was made by separating the low-density, single-family dwellings from the low-rise apartments. The apartment blocks were planned for areas with clusters of trees and excellent viewscapes, but close to the town plaza. The low-density residences that were more likely to have children living in them were oriented around elementary schools and parks. Cul-de-sacs were avoided in favour of better linkages and pedestrian access.

Two highways diverge from <a href="British%20Columbia%20Highway%2097%23John%20Hart%20Highway">Highway 97</a> and intersect in Tumbler Ridge: <a href="British%20Columbia%20Highway%2052">Highway 52</a> (Heritage Highway) which runs 98 km (61 mi) south at Arras, and <a href="British%20Columbia%20Highway%2029">Highway 29</a> which runs 90 km (56 mi) southeast from Chetwynd. At the intersection Highway 29 ends but Highway 52 continues south through Tumbler Ridge, then unpaved, it runs northeast to <a href="British%20Columbia%20Highway%202">Highway 2</a> near the <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a> border. In town, the 28 km (17 mi) of paved roads are laid out in a curvilinear pattern that use two arterial roads, MacKenzie Way and Monkman Way, to connect each section of town. Service roads from the townsite to the mines and forestry areas are maintained by the industries but are unpaved.

The unmanned <a href="Tumbler%20Ridge%20Airport">Tumbler Ridge Airport</a>, with its 1,219 m (4,000 ft) asphalt runway, is used by chartered and local flights. The closest airports with regularly scheduled flights are in Dawson Creek, Fort St John and Grande Prairie. The rail line into town is a 132 km (82 mi) formerly <a href="Railway%20electrification%20system">electrified branch line</a> through the Rocky Mountains constructed by <a href="BC%20Rail">BC Rail</a> to transport coal to the Ridley Terminal at the <a href="Port%20of%20Prince%20Rupert">Port of Prince Rupert</a>. The branch line includes two major tunnels: the 9 km (6 mi) Table Tunnel and the 6 km (4 mi) Wolverine Tunnel.

The town funds its own 14-member composite fire department with a paid Fire Chief and Protective Services Specialist, water treatment system, and sewage disposal system. <a href="Water%20supply">Drinking water</a> is drawn from two drilled wells south of the townsite where it is stored in a 7 million litre reservoir before being <a href="Water%20chlorination">chlorinated</a> and pumped into town. The storm sewers empty into the Murray River, but the <a href="Sewage%20treatment">sanitary sewage</a> is processed through a <a href="Aerated%20lagoon">lagoon</a> system and released into the Murray River north of town. Both the town and the province, through the <a href="Northern%20Health">Northern Health Authority</a>, operate the Tumbler Ridge Community Health Centre. The closest hospitals with over-night beds are in Chetwynd and Dawson Creek. The two public schools, Tumbler Ridge Elementary School and <a href="Tumbler%20Ridge%20Secondary%20School">Tumbler Ridge Secondary School</a> are run by the <a href="School%20District%2059%20Peace%20River%20South">School District 59 Peace River South</a>. Post-secondary courses, programs, and industry training are offered by <a href="Northern%20Lights%20College">Northern Lights College</a> at the secondary school and community centre.

Tumbler Ridge was built to provide a labour force for the coal mining industry, which has remained the dominant employer throughout the town's history. The mining companies had a contract to sell 100 million tons of coal to a consortium of Japanese steel mills over 15 years for US$7.5 billion (1981). The Quintette Operating Corporation (QOC) was formed by partnership between <a href="Denison%20Mines">Denison Mines</a> (50%), <a href="Mitsui">Mitsui Mining</a> (20%), Tokyo Boeki (20%), and other smaller firms, and began blasting at the Quintette mine in October 1982. The Bullmoose Operating Corporation was formed by the <a href="Teck%20Cominco">Teck Corporation</a> (51%), Lornex (39%), <a href="Sojitz">Nissho Iwai</a> (10%) and worked the smaller Bullmoose mine. The economic viability of the mining companies were in question since the world coal prices began falling in the early 1980s and the Japanese consortium requested reduced prices. After the Supreme Court ruled that the coal prices must be reduced, the QOC filed for court protection from its creditors allowing the Teck Corporation to take over management in 1992. By 1996, even as lay-offs continued, over half the town's labour force were employed at one of the two mines. New contracts with the Japanese consortium, signed 1997, moved production to the lower cost Bullmoose mine but guaranteed production until 2003 when that mine was expected to be exhausted. The Quintette mine was closed altogether on August 31, 2000.

While there was an intent by the town's planners to move to a more diversified economy, the few initiatives in this direction were not supported by the industries or local decision-makers. Uncertainty about the town's future had been a serious concern to residents since the 1984 price reduction demands, but it was not until the closure of the Quintette mine that the town seriously investigate a diversification. Since then employment has been generated in tourism (attractions from dinosaur fossil discoveries, outdoor recreation, and nearby provincial parks), forestry, and oil and gas exploration.

A $1.4 billion Murray River coal mine project near Tumbler Ridge, operated by HD Mining International, a company majority-owned by <a href="Huiyong%20Holdings%20Group">Huiyong Holdings Group</a>, a private company from <a href="China">China</a> uses <a href="long-wall%20mining">long-wall mining</a> in which "coal is extracted along a wall in large blocks and then carried out on a conveyor belt." Penggui Yan, CEO of HD Mining and its controlling shareholder, was a manager of the state-owned China Shenhua Energy Co (CSEC), China's largest coal company, which had developed a highly advanced long-wall mining technology. In 2013 HD mining brought in 52 workers from China through the federal <a href="Temporary%20foreign%20worker%20program%20in%20Canada">Temporary Foreign Worker Program</a>(TFWP) claiming a requirement of the job is an ability to speak <a href="Mandarin%20Chinese">Mandarin</a>.
The hiring was challenged in a <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a> <a href="federal%20Court%20%28Canada%29">federal court</a> by two <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Operating%20Engineers">labour unions</a> in April 2013,
The unions claimed there were qualified Canadian job applicants, however the case was dismissed by Justice <a href="Russell%20Zinn">Russell Zinn</a> who found there was nothing to support the unions claim.

After dinosaur <a href="trackway">trackway</a>s were discovered in 2000, and bones in 2002, the Tumbler Ridge Museum Foundation began excavations and opened the Peace Region Palaeontology Research Centre. Fossils and bones are displayed at both locations. Tours and educational programs related to dinosaur, the trackways, and the wilderness are offered.
Tumbler Ridge's location among the Rocky Mountains has allowed for the development of numerous trail systems for motorized and non-motorized recreation. The trails and open areas span numerous mountains. <a href="Kinuseo%20Falls">Kinuseo Falls</a> along the Murray River in the <a href="Monkman%20Provincial%20Park">Monkman Provincial Park</a> is the most popular destination for visitors to Tumbler Ridge. Two other <a href="List%20of%20British%20Columbia%20Provincial%20Parks">provincial parks</a> are just outside the municipal boundaries: <a href="Bearhole%20Lake%20Provincial%20Park%20and%20Protected%20Area">Bearhole Lake Provincial Park</a> and <a href="Gwillim%20Lake%20Provincial%20Park">Gwillim Lake Provincial Park</a>.

Annual events held in Tumbler Ridge include the Grizfest Music Festival, Emperor's Challenge – promoted as the most beautiful and most challenging half-marathon in the world – and the Ridge Ramble Cross-Country Ski Race. The Grizfest Music Festival (formerly Grizzly Valley Days) is a two-day concert held on the August long weekend, and includes a parade, dance, art show, and other community-wide events. The Emperor's Challenge, also in August, is a 21 km (13 mi) <a href="Half%20marathon">marathon</a> up Roman Mountain.

Tumbler Ridge has one newspaper published in the community, the locally owned and operated "Tumbler Ridge News" (formerly "Community Connections"). The "Tumbler Ridge Observer" formerly covered the town and was published by the "Peace River Block Daily News" in Dawson Creek. "The Ridge Blog" was a short-lived online news source. One newsletter, "Coffee Talk", based out of Chetwynd, is circulated in the town. No radio station, or television station broadcasts from the town but there are local repeaters for stations from larger centres.

In Fall 2014 Tumbler Ridge was designated a full member of UNESCO's <a href="Global%20Geopark%20Network">Global Geopark Network</a>. Comprising 7,822 km, the geopark highlights the geological heritage of the area such as Cretaceous dinosaur tracks and bone bed and fossils of Triassic fishes and marine reptiles. 

The District of Tumbler Ridge's <a href="council-manager">council-manager</a> form of <a href="municipal%20government">municipal government</a> is headed by a mayor (who also represents Tumbler Ridge on the <a href="Peace%20River%20Regional%20District">Peace River Regional District</a>'s governing board) and a six-member council; these positions are subject to <a href="Plurality-at-large%20voting">at-large</a> elections every three years. Don McPherson was elected mayor on November 15, 2014, succeeding Darwin Wren. Sherry Berringer was elected as school trustee for a third term, sitting on the board of <a href="School%20District%2059%20Peace%20River%20South">School District 59</a>. The city funds a volunteer fire department headed by full-time fire chief Dustin Curry.
